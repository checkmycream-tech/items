            <li>I have fair skin</li>
            <li>If you want good coverage for blemishes I wouldnt recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I have a good tan</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve read some good reviews about mineral products but to try it on was something different.&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m very happy to say that ULTA allowed me to return the opened product, no questions asked, for a full refund.    </li>
            <li>I have gotten so many compliments on how great I look since using these products.</li>
            <li>If you still aren&#x27;t happy with your coverage, then you can apply more.  </li>
            <li>I have found my ideal coverage method and started to enjoy the flexibility of experimenting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used this product for years and love it!  </li>
            <li>LOVE!</li>
            <li>This kit is wonderful but be aware that it doesn&#x27;t contain the primer, the tube you see in the picture is the washing soap for the brushes.</li>
            <li>LOVE this powder!  </li>
            <li>Love this makeup!</li>
            <li>I purchased the starter kit in Fairly Light at a Sephora store after having a makeover that looked really great...</li>
            <li>I was using a powder foundation before this, and this stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li>So, I used my own...</li>
            <li>This product is a one of a kind</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have any makeup of my own, so I took some of the junk my mom had, since she wasn&#x27;t going to use</li>
            <li>I liked the colors in the product line, and was in the mood for a change.</li>
            <li>I liked the feeling on my face.</li>
            <li>This made my skin feel nice but it turned my skin a purple hue.</li>
            <li>I liked that the products had a DVD to show you how to apply and even the eyeshadows had a diagram on how to use.  </li>
            <li>I was able to find exactly which items within the starter kit work best for me.</li>
            <li>Its amazing and makes my skin feel soft and beautiful!</li>
            <li>I purchased it from Amazon and after first time I have used it, the coverage was ok, not the best (I have used better foundations before).</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get in the creases of your face and no matter what your age you can be beautiful on a consistent basis.</li>
            <li>I thought I would never see the day when I liked my skin, and today I can say that I now love it.</li>
            <li>As for the bare minerals, it is great!!!</li>
            <li>Buying Bare Escentuals is one of the best things I&#x27;ve ever done.</li>
            <li>I will probably end up mixing in \\&quot;warmth\\&quot; to make it darker for my skin), 1 \\&quot;warmth\\&quot; (which is like the sun-kissed light bronzer that I love to use on my checks, forehead and chin), 1 brush cleaner tube (hugee tube!)</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s hooked now too. :)</li>
            <li>I had been using sheer cover and was very happy with it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so in love with this product.</li>
            <li>and I have already recommended it to many of my friends and family.</li>
            <li>You will LOVE LOVE LOVE this starter kit.     </li>
            <li>I actually use the medium beige foundation, but find that the lighter shade is a perfect concealor.</li>
            <li>It gives ok coverage and you don&#x27;t look like you&#x27;re wearing make</li>
            <li>I love the videos to help you apply it as well.</li>
            <li>I do not know what it is about this stuff, but my skin is in love.</li>
            <li>I love the way it covers, and feels.</li>
            <li>I love bareMinerals.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;warmth\\&quot; gives dimension and warmth :).</li>
            <li>I will be buying again. :)</li>
            <li>has so many positives to it...</li>
            <li>I love that you get the   cd with it</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Just love it...</li>
            <li>I love this makeup.  </li>
            <li>It does take me a bit longer to apply my makeup, but I am covering up more flaws like under eyes, redness on chin and nose.  </li>
            <li>I am also using the prime time foundation primer, and I have used my makeup without it also, and prime time does help the minerals look better, so I do use it every day.  </li>
            <li>I have used BareMinerals for many years.  </li>
            <li>Best of all- because the Bare Minerals look is so natural, most people think I have beautiful skin rather than a made up face.    </li>
            <li>Some reviewers expressed a desire for a look with more coverage.</li>
            <li>but I found more helpful tutorials from users on YouTube to be more helpful.  </li>
            <li>This seems to work a lot better.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>there was one additional thing in this package, but she wasn&#x27;t sure what it was</li>
            <li>You could easily fit 5-6 of the starter kit in it!</li>
            <li>I have also been more prone to breakouts (go figure</li>
            <li>Have always wanted to try this makeup, finally was able to, and I love it!!!  </li>
            <li>I was very excited to recieve my order.</li>
            <li>Great product, would highly recommend it to anyone</li>
            <li>Its easy, fast, looks great..</li>
            <li>, it was a hassle to have to deal with, and I had pretty good skin anyway.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money!!</li>
            <li>The product is incredible; I have acne problems and the foundation I am used to using only seems to break me out more and always feels caked on.</li>
            <li>I love this light weight makeup.  </li>
            <li>, my skin stayed great throughout the entire day, it felt so wonderful and light, and finally it turned out to be cheap considering of all the times you have to run to the store to buy more makeup.  </li>
            <li>I have used other mineral products but I like this one best.</li>
            <li>Never having used make up before, I say that it&#x27;s quite easy to put on, and unless you want it to disappear mid-day, I say get a primer.</li>
            <li>Sheer cover gave great coverage and if it rained I still looked okay</li>
            <li>ow easy</li>
            <li>Very quick to put on.  </li>
            <li>, it has excellent coverage, very lightweight, and looks totally natural.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so light and easy to apply  </li>
            <li>The make up goes on smooth and it is really easy to use.</li>
            <li>The powders give my skin an even tone while minimizing the appearance of fine lines and pores.</li>
            <li>I think this product is easy to use and it feels light on the skin.  </li>
            <li>it is super pricey having gone from drug store brands!).  </li>
            <li>What a difference the very first time I used it!</li>
            <li>It goes on so smoothly, you can&#x27;t even tell you have makeup on.</li>
            <li>The great news is I got my money back.</li>
            <li>They also have included a free eye liner.</li>
            <li>The make up does feel light</li>
            <li>so I wanted something light that &#x27;accentuated&#x27; not covered and this worked well.  </li>
            <li>Never would have guessed it would be so smooth on your face.  </li>
            <li>*Great coverage especially with the concealer brush.  </li>
            <li>But it was simple to use, made my skin look great</li>
            <li>I was VERY hesitant to fork out this kind of money on makeup.</li>
            <li>I like the light feel of the bareMinerals makeup.  </li>
            <li>It was supposed to be good for my sensitive skin, would cover my melasma, etc.  </li>
            <li>you will have a flawless air brush look and end us using less as time passes because you no longer need to cover up!</li>
            <li>Dark acne scars and fresh acne spots are covered easily by the matte foundation (bought separately) and it&#x27;s awesome to look and</li>
            <li>*SUPER easy to blend.  </li>
            <li>Just watch how much of the Warmth you use, it&#x27;s very easy to over</li>
            <li>The colors were perfect for me, that&#x27;s true, but after the first use, I noticed my skin was COVERED with fine lines, and looked very, very dry!</li>
            <li>I bought this set after my sister-in-law used her&#x27;s on me and she was able to cover up my rosacea pretty well.  </li>
            <li>I do agree, you need to put on some moisturizer first to get it to stick better.  </li>
            <li>This \\&quot;luminous\\&quot; quality of the Original formula isn&#x27;t for me.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the money!</li>
            <li>I got the medium tone started kit and was excited to try it out.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to put it on for work this morning</li>
            <li>I walked out excited to have discovered a foundation that was good for my skin, felt lightweight but gave moderate coverage, and didn&#x27;t sink into my fine lines.</li>
            <li>and I recommend that you tap a bit on your hand first because it is EXTREMELY strong, but if you put the right amount on it looks lovely.</li>
            <li>The blemish coverage is really good, better than I expected with the special brush.  </li>
            <li>Bare Minerals cover up any blemishes or red perfectly</li>
            <li>I had to use my own soft synthetic kabuki and powder brushes.  </li>
            <li>As for the makeup itself...once you get the hang of using it, you WILL love it as much as I do.</li>
            <li>The only I thought was good was the bronzer.</li>
            <li>Loved the starter kit and will definitely recommend.</li>
            <li>minutes later: my face started getting a very mild stinging warm sensation that would increase until it got to the point that I HAD to remove it (about 10 minutes after the start).  </li>
            <li>If your pores still look large after applying a light amount, spray your face lighting with a light misting finishing spray</li>
            <li>So I kept a super greasy moisturizer in the box to remind myself to hydrate before using.</li>
            <li>The starter kits really are a great value especially with the brushes.  </li>
            <li>The brushes are fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;It arrived quickly</li>
            <li>I am spending QUITE a bit more than what I did before on the makeup part (almost $75 more overall -</li>
            <li>but Bare Minerals does look very natural, great coverage without looking like you have any make up on.</li>
            <li>Before, I would wear drugstore products...and then, only when I had to (like if I was going somewhere special and wanted to look nice.)</li>
            <li>*Easy to apply too much.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and many times will have a break out on my face.</li>
            <li>First, got to my house, in 3 days of ordering it!  </li>
            <li>But as I tend to tan easily in the summer, I needed to change foundation shades recently and decided to give BM one more try, as I did like the finish of it.    </li>
            <li>its so light on the skin, easy to create the exact tone you feel like appearing into every morning and cover the pores very naturally.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Mineral Cosmetics are great, but BE bareMinerals I find to be too harsh for me.  </li>
            <li>The one thing I don&#x27;t think I needed so much was the warmth powder, but I believe that may be because it&#x27;s fall now and looking darker isn&#x27;t as important.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of white or something.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>but the kit was definitely worth it.  </li>
            <li>On top of that, it completely changed the effects of my skin.  </li>
            <li>It is a more natural look.  </li>
            <li>just a more natural look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>It feels so light, clean and I havent gotten one zit so far..</li>
            <li>No matter how much I want to love this makeup, it makes my skin look 20 years older.</li>
            <li>I found the right make up to cover my lupus and told my cousins about it they have Lupus.</li>
            <li>so I switched to bare minerals granted its more than I used to spend but worth every penny</li>
            <li>I do think this product offers great coverage for red acne spots and over all smooth natural look.</li>
            <li>No makeup is right for every person, but I&#x27;ve been using Bare Escentuals for over a year, and I&#x27;ve never had so many compliments on my skin.  </li>
            <li>Application is easy and fun, I feel like a professional when I use the high-quality brushes.</li>
            <li>I love the Bare Escentuals products and would recommend it to anyone that wears makeup.</li>
            <li>I love the Bare Escentuals products.</li>
            <li>The Bare Minerals beige works with my skin tone and makes me look healthy.</li>
            <li>I felt like I needed something better, and Bare Minerals is the product I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I love Bare Minerals make-up and will not wear anything else.</li>
            <li>and it was more economical for me to purchase a starter kit rather than each brush individually</li>
            <li>Thank you to Bare Minerals for making such an incredible product, and thanks to the seller for making it accessible, affordable, and for such quick delivery.</li>
            <li>And sure enough after using it for 3 days...</li>
            <li>Sure, if you cake on BM, it will last like one or two months.</li>
            <li>Well let me tell you, this is the first review I&#x27;ve ever written because I feel soooo ripped off by this product.</li>
            <li>now, for the grand shebang: it&#x27;s ONLY $29.98!!!</li>
            <li>the mirror and say \\&quot;I look freaking pretty</li>
            <li>This was my first time trying mineral makeup</li>
            <li>The foundation is not waterproof but some of the mascara&#x27;s are so try not to wet your hands and wipe your face on warm summer days.</li>
            <li>I am using my regular foundation and putting the medium foundation on top and polishing it off with the bronzer and veil.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>I guess next time I will read the sizes in the description more closely, or just go to Sephora in person to pick this up.</li>
            <li>Covergirl Line Exact liquid eyeliner, Target makeup removal wipes and some cleansers; and some</li>
            <li>For as popular a brand that bare minerals is you would think they could put a little more effort into their brush making.</li>
            <li>After seeing how some other users applied the makeup on YouTube I start to deviate from the BMs method and found my own.  </li>
            <li>I still actually think it is/was pretty good - especially for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So, not a huge biggy, since most kits I&#x27;d imagine have cheap brushes.  </li>
            <li>The only negative comment is that they eye shadow needs to be reapplied quite a bit through the day, but the mineral veil is simply wonderful!</li>
            <li>I got my product fast, and it was exactly what i ordered.</li>
            <li>Gift for my daughter, ho really likes their products and who I started her first makeup years ago with this company.</li>
            <li>For large pores you can try aveeno tinted moisturizer which \\&quot;fills in\\&quot; your pores before applying your mineral foundation.</li>
            <li>Olay microsculpting cream, Lancome Hypnose mascara, 100% Pure organic coffee bean undereye cream,</li>
            <li>a large blusher brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been using BareMinerals for several years now and needed some more and found the bareMinerals Get Started Kit with Bonus Gift - Medium to give me new brushes too.</li>
            <li>Order received on 4/2 expected date was 4/8 extremely pleased.</li>
            <li>I have not broken out once since I started using this.</li>
            <li>So, off the BE went with washing my face in gentle cleanser.  </li>
            <li>oh, and a tip i found from BM website is that if your foundation is too light for you- mix in a tiny bit of \\&quot;warmth\\&quot; to make it darker    </li>
            <li>Plus, it wouldn&#x27;t stick unless my face was really uberly moisturized.</li>
            <li>Received the make up in a very timely matter.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t get over how much my skin has improved since I have been using it.</li>
            <li>They brush on so smoothly and last all day.</li>
            <li>I have acne scars and the powder covers it really well.</li>
            <li>It feels really light on your face and you only need to use a bit and your flaws will go away.</li>
            <li>and the instructional DVD was very helpful.</li>
            <li>It was packed very well, and I really don&#x27;t have any qualms about it.</li>
            <li>but several additional products as well (Stroke of Light Eye Brightener[$22];</li>
            <li>, that really helped me...</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for you time.                     </li>
            <li>Much to my surprise, my sister called me Christmas morning</li>
            <li>I really like is no longer having the makeup line.  </li>
            <li>Even if I apply too much I can still buff it out so it evens out.  </li>
            <li>My skin has cleared up so much since I started using it.</li>
            <li>I bought this as a gift for someone and can&#x27;t really rate this</li>
            <li>Ready TM Blush (the One),</li>
            <li>:  I really like the colors offered in the eyeshadow and blush.  </li>
            <li>I looked up the full prices of all the items included in the Get Started Kit on the Bare Escentuals website [...]</li>
            <li>but so far its a 5 star!!!</li>
            <li>Apparently a rection to the bismuth can come on at any time, and I&#x27;m lucky that I did not suffer from the cystic reaction that my dermatologist suggested some sufferers experience.</li>
            <li>and I can honestly say my dark marks get covered completely (even in a close up photo!).  </li>
            <li>So, just a word of caution to all, and a reminder that there are many other choices out there.</li>
            <li>I purchased this Bare Minerals starter kit at the beginning of the year and can honestly say I will never go back to my old makeup.</li>
            <li>- maybe they substituted that for more of the other things?  </li>
            <li>I told a co worker about it, and she said she&#x27;d tried it and found the same thing to be true.</li>
            <li>If your coverage is too light, simply apply more layers of powder until your desired look is achieved and buff with the fluffy brush.</li>
            <li>In rating the product itself, I&#x27;d give it a 5, but for the cost I HAD to knock it down a point (maybe should have knocked it more -</li>
            <li>I found everything I needed and more at such a low price.  </li>
            <li>Make sure when you use the blush that you only use a tiny bit</li>
            <li>Very light doesn&#x27;t feel heavy but covers spots that need covering.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend anyone to try this.</li>
            <li>, I never had this problem in high school</li>
            <li>I should add that I am black and have what can be best described as &#x27;brown sugar&#x27; colored skin and had no trouble matching as I know women of color often do with make-up (at least from what I read).  </li>
            <li>You try adding a little more and buffing to get the airbrush look which it does give you</li>
            <li>I was wrong, this stuff is great</li>
            <li>I used my own moisturizer, since I have sensitive skin, and I allowed it to set in like usual.  </li>
            <li>People there might be able to help you pick out your shade if you&#x27;re having trouble.     </li>
            <li>I was able to figure out how to use it by myself, the DVD was a waste of time.</li>
            <li>I had been getting by pretty cheap on drug store makeup, but I thought it was time to pay attention to what I was slathering on my face everyday.</li>
            <li>finally I got the right foundation that fits in my skin.  </li>
            <li>I predict one foundation of BM will last me about 4-5 months,the \\&quot;warmth\\&quot; will last longer because no one uses it more than foundation unless they want to look like Snooki, and the veil will last a bit longer than the foundation-once again, depends on how much shimmer you want.     </li>
            <li>I live abroad</li>
            <li>I have found a new make-up.</li>
            <li>She loves this makeup and wanted all new brushes, so she asked for another &amp;#34;starter kit&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>BE foundation was blendable with using light layers, but coverage was light and not great...</li>
            <li>it depends entirely on how much coverage you need, and how much you put on.</li>
            <li>I am very sensitive to cornstarch.  </li>
            <li>She was very surprised that I would find and buy her this.</li>
            <li>It blended well and gave the appearance of very natural skin.</li>
            <li>Very natural looking.  </li>
            <li>I gave it only 4 stars because I do have some problem areas that I need to apply a little bit of liquid foundation before the bareMinerals because I don&#x27;t think coverage is good enough for my chin and around my nose.  </li>
            <li>First of all..you get the ESSENTIAL makeup brushes with the kit...</li>
            <li>The first kit was my initial starter kit.</li>
            <li>The DVD was more of an advertisement for their other products, which I will admit I bought some of them later on</li>
            <li>The mascara opens up my lashes wide and full, I feel like a model from the 40s almost.</li>
            <li>a little pricey good but not worth the money.</li>
            <li>It also very very messy so make sure you have a towel under it while applying it.</li>
            <li>(I actually recommend both the small fat kabuki brush and the handy buki brush).</li>
            <li>no bad smells unlike other brushes I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply, completely covered up the redness, and I didn&#x27;t have that heavy makeup feel.</li>
            <li>I am pretty fair but the medium is just right for me, it adds a little bit of \\&quot;tan\\&quot; without looking fake or to made up.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had such luck yet, but I need to play with it a little more.  </li>
            <li>I had to go back to clinique and buy their comfort on call, to calm my burning and itchy face that same afternoon.  </li>
            <li>it helps her not feel so self conscious about her appearance.</li>
            <li>Cons: doesnt cover well and causes break outs for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>that work with my sensitive skin...</li>
            <li>, 1 \\&quot;veil\\&quot; (which is a light shimmerly looking powder, almost whitesh pink that you put on last to pick up oils on your face and its suppose to give you a finished, glowey look ..which it does!), and 3 brushes (they are so soft, but</li>
            <li>it was to use and how concise the instructions were.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m used to not wearing any makeup for fear that I might cause another breakout, and I think this makeup looks natural and still covers my acne marks</li>
            <li>I am a 36 year old, ex smoker with old acne scarring and sun damage.</li>
            <li>I would get frequent break outs and they have all but stopped since I have been using this kit.</li>
            <li>I was surprised to see so any items included in the package.</li>
            <li>It really lasts throughout the day, occasionally I will retouch.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>Wow is all I can say.  </li>
            <li>My skin didn&#x27;t break out, and the coverage was natural and pretty, but I can&#x27;t deal with the dry skin issue or the shiny/shimmery look.</li>
            <li>I stand over the sink and apply my bare minerals foundation and by the time I am done it looks like a man has shaved his beard over the sink and my top is covered in dozens of tiny little hairs.</li>
            <li>Expensive, but nicely packaged, and high quality.  </li>
            <li>I could not get Bare Minerals off my face fast enough.  </li>
            <li>They found that there was a glitch in their financial system that they were aware of for the last 10 days and said my sister had not yet been charged for this gift card and that was why it did not work (</li>
            <li>Very light makeup, if you don&#x27;t need heavy base this is a great product.  </li>
            <li>It seems like many of the items will last a long time (e.g. I think the blush,eyeshadow, Warmth, Well-rested for eyes, as well as the Prime Time will last a very long time).  </li>
            <li>I did also buy a new moisturizer around the same time, so although I speculated that this may have been the culprit, I decided to try a bismuth-free makeup at my dermatologist&#x27;s suggestion.</li>
            <li>The biggest is used for foundation and \\&quot;veil\\&quot; only, the second biggest is for \\&quot;warmth\\&quot;, and the tiny brush is for added touch up of scars or what not-I never use it) and all this comes with a CD with Leslie putting makeup on people and advertising ALLL her products (of course) and a cute black box that has it all.     </li>
            <li>My skin became red and absolutely covered in tiny, itchy bumps.</li>
            <li>I usually don&#x27;t use finishing powder on my skin, but the bare mineral starter kit was so light on my skin.</li>
            <li>So I decided to try it, was a little bit skeptical at first because i just couldnt see how a powder could be a good foundation with coverage.</li>
            <li>The warmth is not really a blush, it doesn&#x27;t fit into any other catagory</li>
            <li>The brushes are fantastic, especially the small cover-all brush.</li>
            <li>I started using Bare Minerals after my daughter recommended it to me.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t know how bare minerals will hold up</li>
            <li>I in fact, still use the box to hold my bare minerals powers, etc.</li>
            <li>I was using Mary Kay mineral makeup and a friend suggested Bare Minerals.</li>
            <li>I tried Bare Minerals years ago, don&#x27;t know why I stopped.</li>
            <li>A Bare Escentuals Woman for Life,                                               Patti B.</li>
            <li>Bare Escentuals BareMinerals</li>
            <li>As I have gotten older, I&#x27;ve developed quite a bit of redness on my cheeks, and my skin seems to alternate between oily and extremely dry.</li>
            <li>When I told a friend of the troubles I was having with my skin, she told me about The Get Started Kit by Bare Minerals.  </li>
            <li>I am a 35-40yr old female with a medium complexion.  </li>
            <li>Last fall, I took a short hiatus and returned only to have my skin react very badly--awful, red, bumpy patches/rash and swollen eyes.</li>
            <li>Covergirl Instant Cheekbones Blush, Neutrogena Skin Blends Natural Radiance Bronzer, and Various eyeshadows.  </li>
            <li>And even though the make-up is pretty, it is not worth the hassle of having to deal with the company!</li>
            <li>This is not for dry, sensitive skin!  </li>
            <li>In addition, in doing some digging online, I found that it is VERY common for this kind of reaction to pop up, and I&#x27;m surprised that this company does not offer any sort of warning about the harsh ingredient that their product contains.</li>
            <li>I use is sparingly but have received several compliments (not on the make-up specifically but on the &#x27;look&#x27; in general).  </li>
            <li>Okay for two days, although my face appeared extremely greasy, so not thrilled with that.</li>
            <li>I saw Bare Minerals commercial and was hooked.  </li>
            <li>My wife simply loves her Bare Minerals kit that I got her.  </li>
            <li>finally I have decided to try bare minerals.</li>
            <li>so when I was running low on sheer cover I decided to try bare minerals...</li>
            <li>have very sensitive combination skin with dry areas, and Bare Minerals accentuated and clung to all the dry patches.</li>
            <li>The few that know the &#x27;secret&#x27; love the way it looks!  </li>

            <li> I have used this product for years and love it!  </li>
            <li> LOVE!</li>
            <li> This kit is wonderful but be aware that it doesn&#x27;t contain the primer, the tube you see in the picture is the washing soap for the brushes.</li>
            <li> LOVE this powder!  </li>
            <li> Love this makeup!</li>
            <li> I purchased the starter kit in Fairly Light at a Sephora store after having a makeover that looked really great...</li>
            <li> I was using a powder foundation before this, and this stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li> So, I used my own...</li>
            <li> This product is a one of a kind</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any makeup of my own, so I took some of the junk my mom had, since she wasn&#x27;t going to use</li>
            <li> I liked the colors in the product line, and was in the mood for a change.</li>
            <li> I liked the feeling on my face.</li>
            <li> This made my skin feel nice but it turned my skin a purple hue.</li>
            <li> I liked that the products had a DVD to show you how to apply and even the eyeshadows had a diagram on how to use.  </li>
            <li> I was able to find exactly which items within the starter kit work best for me.</li>
            <li> Its amazing and makes my skin feel soft and beautiful!</li>
            <li> I purchased it from Amazon and after first time I have used it, the coverage was ok, not the best (I have used better foundations before).</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get in the creases of your face and no matter what your age you can be beautiful on a consistent basis.</li>
            <li> I thought I would never see the day when I liked my skin, and today I can say that I now love it.</li>
            <li> As for the bare minerals, it is great!!!</li>
            <li> Buying Bare Escentuals is one of the best things I&#x27;ve ever done.</li>
            <li> I will probably end up mixing in \\&quot;warmth\\&quot; to make it darker for my skin), 1 \\&quot;warmth\\&quot; (which is like the sun-kissed light bronzer that I love to use on my checks, forehead and chin), 1 brush cleaner tube (hugee tube!)</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s hooked now too. :)</li>
            <li> I had been using sheer cover and was very happy with it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so in love with this product.</li>
            <li> and I have already recommended it to many of my friends and family.</li>
            <li> You will LOVE LOVE LOVE this starter kit.     </li>
            <li> I actually use the medium beige foundation, but find that the lighter shade is a perfect concealor.</li>
            <li> It gives ok coverage and you don&#x27;t look like you&#x27;re wearing make</li>
            <li> I love the videos to help you apply it as well.</li>
            <li> I do not know what it is about this stuff, but my skin is in love.</li>
            <li> I love the way it covers, and feels.</li>
            <li> I love bareMinerals.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;warmth\\&quot; gives dimension and warmth :).</li>
            <li> I will be buying again. :)</li>
            <li> has so many positives to it...</li>
            <li> I love that you get the   cd with it</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> Just love it...</li>
            <li> I love this makeup.  </li>
            <li> It does take me a bit longer to apply my makeup, but I am covering up more flaws like under eyes, redness on chin and nose.  </li>
            <li> I am also using the prime time foundation primer, and I have used my makeup without it also, and prime time does help the minerals look better, so I do use it every day.  </li>
            <li> I have used BareMinerals for many years.  </li>
            <li> Best of all- because the Bare Minerals look is so natural, most people think I have beautiful skin rather than a made up face.    </li>
            <li> Some reviewers expressed a desire for a look with more coverage.</li>
            <li> but I found more helpful tutorials from users on YouTube to be more helpful.  </li>
            <li> This seems to work a lot better.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> there was one additional thing in this package, but she wasn&#x27;t sure what it was</li>
            <li> You could easily fit 5-6 of the starter kit in it!</li>
            <li> I have also been more prone to breakouts (go figure</li>
            <li> Have always wanted to try this makeup, finally was able to, and I love it!!!  </li>
            <li> I was very excited to recieve my order.</li>
            <li> Great product, would highly recommend it to anyone</li>
            <li> Its easy, fast, looks great..</li>
            <li> , it was a hassle to have to deal with, and I had pretty good skin anyway.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money!!</li>
            <li> The product is incredible; I have acne problems and the foundation I am used to using only seems to break me out more and always feels caked on.</li>
            <li> I love this light weight makeup.  </li>
            <li> , my skin stayed great throughout the entire day, it felt so wonderful and light, and finally it turned out to be cheap considering of all the times you have to run to the store to buy more makeup.  </li>
            <li> I have used other mineral products but I like this one best.</li>
            <li> Never having used make up before, I say that it&#x27;s quite easy to put on, and unless you want it to disappear mid-day, I say get a primer.</li>
            <li> Sheer cover gave great coverage and if it rained I still looked okay</li>
            <li> ow easy</li>
            <li> Very quick to put on.  </li>
            <li> , it has excellent coverage, very lightweight, and looks totally natural.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so light and easy to apply  </li>
            <li> The make up goes on smooth and it is really easy to use.</li>
            <li> The powders give my skin an even tone while minimizing the appearance of fine lines and pores.</li>
            <li> I think this product is easy to use and it feels light on the skin.  </li>
            <li> it is super pricey having gone from drug store brands!).  </li>
            <li> What a difference the very first time I used it!</li>
            <li> It goes on so smoothly, you can&#x27;t even tell you have makeup on.</li>
            <li> The great news is I got my money back.</li>
            <li> They also have included a free eye liner.</li>
            <li> The make up does feel light</li>
            <li> so I wanted something light that &#x27;accentuated&#x27; not covered and this worked well.  </li>
            <li> Never would have guessed it would be so smooth on your face.  </li>
            <li> *Great coverage especially with the concealer brush.  </li>
            <li> But it was simple to use, made my skin look great</li>
            <li> I was VERY hesitant to fork out this kind of money on makeup.</li>
            <li> I like the light feel of the bareMinerals makeup.  </li>
            <li> It was supposed to be good for my sensitive skin, would cover my melasma, etc.  </li>
            <li> you will have a flawless air brush look and end us using less as time passes because you no longer need to cover up!</li>
            <li> Dark acne scars and fresh acne spots are covered easily by the matte foundation (bought separately) and it&#x27;s awesome to look and</li>
            <li> *SUPER easy to blend.  </li>
            <li> Just watch how much of the Warmth you use, it&#x27;s very easy to over</li>
            <li> The colors were perfect for me, that&#x27;s true, but after the first use, I noticed my skin was COVERED with fine lines, and looked very, very dry!</li>
            <li> I bought this set after my sister-in-law used her&#x27;s on me and she was able to cover up my rosacea pretty well.  </li>
            <li> I do agree, you need to put on some moisturizer first to get it to stick better.  </li>
            <li> This \\&quot;luminous\\&quot; quality of the Original formula isn&#x27;t for me.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> I got the medium tone started kit and was excited to try it out.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to put it on for work this morning</li>
            <li> I walked out excited to have discovered a foundation that was good for my skin, felt lightweight but gave moderate coverage, and didn&#x27;t sink into my fine lines.</li>
            <li> and I recommend that you tap a bit on your hand first because it is EXTREMELY strong, but if you put the right amount on it looks lovely.</li>
            <li> The blemish coverage is really good, better than I expected with the special brush.  </li>
            <li> Bare Minerals cover up any blemishes or red perfectly</li>
            <li> I had to use my own soft synthetic kabuki and powder brushes.  </li>
            <li> As for the makeup itself...once you get the hang of using it, you WILL love it as much as I do.</li>
            <li> The only I thought was good was the bronzer.</li>
            <li> Loved the starter kit and will definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> minutes later: my face started getting a very mild stinging warm sensation that would increase until it got to the point that I HAD to remove it (about 10 minutes after the start).  </li>
            <li> If your pores still look large after applying a light amount, spray your face lighting with a light misting finishing spray</li>
            <li> So I kept a super greasy moisturizer in the box to remind myself to hydrate before using.</li>
            <li> The starter kits really are a great value especially with the brushes.  </li>
            <li> The brushes are fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;It arrived quickly</li>
            <li> I am spending QUITE a bit more than what I did before on the makeup part (almost $75 more overall -</li>
            <li> but Bare Minerals does look very natural, great coverage without looking like you have any make up on.</li>
            <li> Before, I would wear drugstore products...and then, only when I had to (like if I was going somewhere special and wanted to look nice.)</li>
            <li> *Easy to apply too much.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and many times will have a break out on my face.</li>
            <li> First, got to my house, in 3 days of ordering it!  </li>
            <li> But as I tend to tan easily in the summer, I needed to change foundation shades recently and decided to give BM one more try, as I did like the finish of it.    </li>
            <li> its so light on the skin, easy to create the exact tone you feel like appearing into every morning and cover the pores very naturally.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Mineral Cosmetics are great, but BE bareMinerals I find to be too harsh for me.  </li>
            <li> The one thing I don&#x27;t think I needed so much was the warmth powder, but I believe that may be because it&#x27;s fall now and looking darker isn&#x27;t as important.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of white or something.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> but the kit was definitely worth it.  </li>
            <li> On top of that, it completely changed the effects of my skin.  </li>
            <li> It is a more natural look.  </li>
            <li> just a more natural look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> It feels so light, clean and I havent gotten one zit so far..</li>
            <li> No matter how much I want to love this makeup, it makes my skin look 20 years older.</li>
            <li> I found the right make up to cover my lupus and told my cousins about it they have Lupus.</li>
            <li> so I switched to bare minerals granted its more than I used to spend but worth every penny</li>
            <li> I do think this product offers great coverage for red acne spots and over all smooth natural look.</li>
            <li> No makeup is right for every person, but I&#x27;ve been using Bare Escentuals for over a year, and I&#x27;ve never had so many compliments on my skin.  </li>
            <li> Application is easy and fun, I feel like a professional when I use the high-quality brushes.</li>
            <li> I love the Bare Escentuals products and would recommend it to anyone that wears makeup.</li>
            <li> I love the Bare Escentuals products.</li>
            <li> The Bare Minerals beige works with my skin tone and makes me look healthy.</li>
            <li> I felt like I needed something better, and Bare Minerals is the product I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I love Bare Minerals make-up and will not wear anything else.</li>
            <li> and it was more economical for me to purchase a starter kit rather than each brush individually</li>
            <li> Thank you to Bare Minerals for making such an incredible product, and thanks to the seller for making it accessible, affordable, and for such quick delivery.</li>
            <li> And sure enough after using it for 3 days...</li>
            <li> Sure, if you cake on BM, it will last like one or two months.</li>
            <li> Well let me tell you, this is the first review I&#x27;ve ever written because I feel soooo ripped off by this product.</li>
            <li> now, for the grand shebang: it&#x27;s ONLY $29.98!!!</li>
            <li> the mirror and say \\&quot;I look freaking pretty</li>
            <li> This was my first time trying mineral makeup</li>
            <li> The foundation is not waterproof but some of the mascara&#x27;s are so try not to wet your hands and wipe your face on warm summer days.</li>
            <li> I am using my regular foundation and putting the medium foundation on top and polishing it off with the bronzer and veil.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> I guess next time I will read the sizes in the description more closely, or just go to Sephora in person to pick this up.</li>
            <li> Covergirl Line Exact liquid eyeliner, Target makeup removal wipes and some cleansers; and some</li>
            <li> For as popular a brand that bare minerals is you would think they could put a little more effort into their brush making.</li>
            <li> After seeing how some other users applied the makeup on YouTube I start to deviate from the BMs method and found my own.  </li>
            <li> I still actually think it is/was pretty good - especially for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So, not a huge biggy, since most kits I&#x27;d imagine have cheap brushes.  </li>
            <li> The only negative comment is that they eye shadow needs to be reapplied quite a bit through the day, but the mineral veil is simply wonderful!</li>
            <li> I got my product fast, and it was exactly what i ordered.</li>
            <li> Gift for my daughter, ho really likes their products and who I started her first makeup years ago with this company.</li>
            <li> For large pores you can try aveeno tinted moisturizer which \\&quot;fills in\\&quot; your pores before applying your mineral foundation.</li>
            <li> Olay microsculpting cream, Lancome Hypnose mascara, 100% Pure organic coffee bean undereye cream,</li>
            <li> a large blusher brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using BareMinerals for several years now and needed some more and found the bareMinerals Get Started Kit with Bonus Gift - Medium to give me new brushes too.</li>
            <li> Order received on 4/2 expected date was 4/8 extremely pleased.</li>
            <li> I have not broken out once since I started using this.</li>
            <li> So, off the BE went with washing my face in gentle cleanser.  </li>
            <li> oh, and a tip i found from BM website is that if your foundation is too light for you- mix in a tiny bit of \\&quot;warmth\\&quot; to make it darker    </li>
            <li> Plus, it wouldn&#x27;t stick unless my face was really uberly moisturized.</li>
            <li> Received the make up in a very timely matter.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get over how much my skin has improved since I have been using it.</li>
            <li> They brush on so smoothly and last all day.</li>
            <li> I have acne scars and the powder covers it really well.</li>
            <li> It feels really light on your face and you only need to use a bit and your flaws will go away.</li>
            <li> and the instructional DVD was very helpful.</li>
            <li> It was packed very well, and I really don&#x27;t have any qualms about it.</li>
            <li> but several additional products as well (Stroke of Light Eye Brightener[$22];</li>
            <li> , that really helped me...</li>
            <li> Thank you so much for you time.                     </li>
            <li> Much to my surprise, my sister called me Christmas morning</li>
            <li> I really like is no longer having the makeup line.  </li>
            <li> Even if I apply too much I can still buff it out so it evens out.  </li>
            <li> My skin has cleared up so much since I started using it.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for someone and can&#x27;t really rate this</li>
            <li> Ready TM Blush (the One),</li>
            <li> :  I really like the colors offered in the eyeshadow and blush.  </li>
            <li> I looked up the full prices of all the items included in the Get Started Kit on the Bare Escentuals website [...]</li>
            <li> but so far its a 5 star!!!</li>
            <li> Apparently a rection to the bismuth can come on at any time, and I&#x27;m lucky that I did not suffer from the cystic reaction that my dermatologist suggested some sufferers experience.</li>
            <li> and I can honestly say my dark marks get covered completely (even in a close up photo!).  </li>
            <li> So, just a word of caution to all, and a reminder that there are many other choices out there.</li>
            <li> I purchased this Bare Minerals starter kit at the beginning of the year and can honestly say I will never go back to my old makeup.</li>
            <li> - maybe they substituted that for more of the other things?  </li>
            <li> I told a co worker about it, and she said she&#x27;d tried it and found the same thing to be true.</li>
            <li> If your coverage is too light, simply apply more layers of powder until your desired look is achieved and buff with the fluffy brush.</li>
            <li> In rating the product itself, I&#x27;d give it a 5, but for the cost I HAD to knock it down a point (maybe should have knocked it more -</li>
            <li> I found everything I needed and more at such a low price.  </li>
            <li> Make sure when you use the blush that you only use a tiny bit</li>
            <li> Very light doesn&#x27;t feel heavy but covers spots that need covering.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend anyone to try this.</li>
            <li> , I never had this problem in high school</li>
            <li> I should add that I am black and have what can be best described as &#x27;brown sugar&#x27; colored skin and had no trouble matching as I know women of color often do with make-up (at least from what I read).  </li>
            <li> You try adding a little more and buffing to get the airbrush look which it does give you</li>
            <li> I was wrong, this stuff is great</li>
            <li> I used my own moisturizer, since I have sensitive skin, and I allowed it to set in like usual.  </li>
            <li> People there might be able to help you pick out your shade if you&#x27;re having trouble.     </li>
            <li> I was able to figure out how to use it by myself, the DVD was a waste of time.</li>
            <li> I had been getting by pretty cheap on drug store makeup, but I thought it was time to pay attention to what I was slathering on my face everyday.</li>
            <li> finally I got the right foundation that fits in my skin.  </li>
            <li> I predict one foundation of BM will last me about 4-5 months,the \\&quot;warmth\\&quot; will last longer because no one uses it more than foundation unless they want to look like Snooki, and the veil will last a bit longer than the foundation-once again, depends on how much shimmer you want.     </li>
            <li> I live abroad</li>
            <li> I have found a new make-up.</li>
            <li> She loves this makeup and wanted all new brushes, so she asked for another &amp;#34;starter kit&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> BE foundation was blendable with using light layers, but coverage was light and not great...</li>
            <li> it depends entirely on how much coverage you need, and how much you put on.</li>
            <li> I am very sensitive to cornstarch.  </li>
            <li> She was very surprised that I would find and buy her this.</li>
            <li> It blended well and gave the appearance of very natural skin.</li>
            <li> Very natural looking.  </li>
            <li> I gave it only 4 stars because I do have some problem areas that I need to apply a little bit of liquid foundation before the bareMinerals because I don&#x27;t think coverage is good enough for my chin and around my nose.  </li>
            <li> First of all..you get the ESSENTIAL makeup brushes with the kit...</li>
            <li> The first kit was my initial starter kit.</li>
            <li> The DVD was more of an advertisement for their other products, which I will admit I bought some of them later on</li>
            <li> The mascara opens up my lashes wide and full, I feel like a model from the 40s almost.</li>
            <li> a little pricey good but not worth the money.</li>
            <li> It also very very messy so make sure you have a towel under it while applying it.</li>
            <li> (I actually recommend both the small fat kabuki brush and the handy buki brush).</li>
            <li> no bad smells unlike other brushes I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, completely covered up the redness, and I didn&#x27;t have that heavy makeup feel.</li>
            <li> I am pretty fair but the medium is just right for me, it adds a little bit of \\&quot;tan\\&quot; without looking fake or to made up.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had such luck yet, but I need to play with it a little more.  </li>
            <li> I had to go back to clinique and buy their comfort on call, to calm my burning and itchy face that same afternoon.  </li>
            <li> it helps her not feel so self conscious about her appearance.</li>
            <li> Cons: doesnt cover well and causes break outs for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> that work with my sensitive skin...</li>
            <li> , 1 \\&quot;veil\\&quot; (which is a light shimmerly looking powder, almost whitesh pink that you put on last to pick up oils on your face and its suppose to give you a finished, glowey look ..which it does!), and 3 brushes (they are so soft, but</li>
            <li> it was to use and how concise the instructions were.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to not wearing any makeup for fear that I might cause another breakout, and I think this makeup looks natural and still covers my acne marks</li>
            <li> I am a 36 year old, ex smoker with old acne scarring and sun damage.</li>
            <li> I would get frequent break outs and they have all but stopped since I have been using this kit.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to see so any items included in the package.</li>
            <li> It really lasts throughout the day, occasionally I will retouch.  </li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> Wow is all I can say.  </li>
            <li> My skin didn&#x27;t break out, and the coverage was natural and pretty, but I can&#x27;t deal with the dry skin issue or the shiny/shimmery look.</li>
            <li> I stand over the sink and apply my bare minerals foundation and by the time I am done it looks like a man has shaved his beard over the sink and my top is covered in dozens of tiny little hairs.</li>
            <li> Expensive, but nicely packaged, and high quality.  </li>
            <li> I could not get Bare Minerals off my face fast enough.  </li>
            <li> They found that there was a glitch in their financial system that they were aware of for the last 10 days and said my sister had not yet been charged for this gift card and that was why it did not work (</li>
            <li> Very light makeup, if you don&#x27;t need heavy base this is a great product.  </li>
            <li> It seems like many of the items will last a long time (e.g. I think the blush,eyeshadow, Warmth, Well-rested for eyes, as well as the Prime Time will last a very long time).  </li>
            <li> I did also buy a new moisturizer around the same time, so although I speculated that this may have been the culprit, I decided to try a bismuth-free makeup at my dermatologist&#x27;s suggestion.</li>
            <li> The biggest is used for foundation and \\&quot;veil\\&quot; only, the second biggest is for \\&quot;warmth\\&quot;, and the tiny brush is for added touch up of scars or what not-I never use it) and all this comes with a CD with Leslie putting makeup on people and advertising ALLL her products (of course) and a cute black box that has it all.     </li>
            <li> My skin became red and absolutely covered in tiny, itchy bumps.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t use finishing powder on my skin, but the bare mineral starter kit was so light on my skin.</li>
            <li> So I decided to try it, was a little bit skeptical at first because i just couldnt see how a powder could be a good foundation with coverage.</li>
            <li> The warmth is not really a blush, it doesn&#x27;t fit into any other catagory</li>
            <li> The brushes are fantastic, especially the small cover-all brush.</li>
            <li> I started using Bare Minerals after my daughter recommended it to me.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know how bare minerals will hold up</li>
            <li> I in fact, still use the box to hold my bare minerals powers, etc.</li>
            <li> I was using Mary Kay mineral makeup and a friend suggested Bare Minerals.</li>
            <li> I tried Bare Minerals years ago, don&#x27;t know why I stopped.</li>

            <li> As I have gotten older, I&#x27;ve developed quite a bit of redness on my cheeks, and my skin seems to alternate between oily and extremely dry.</li>
            <li> When I told a friend of the troubles I was having with my skin, she told me about The Get Started Kit by Bare Minerals.  </li>
            <li> I am a 35-40yr old female with a medium complexion.  </li>
            <li> Last fall, I took a short hiatus and returned only to have my skin react very badly--awful, red, bumpy patches/rash and swollen eyes.</li>
            <li> Covergirl Instant Cheekbones Blush, Neutrogena Skin Blends Natural Radiance Bronzer, and Various eyeshadows.  </li>
            <li> And even though the make-up is pretty, it is not worth the hassle of having to deal with the company!</li>
            <li> This is not for dry, sensitive skin!  </li>
            <li> In addition, in doing some digging online, I found that it is VERY common for this kind of reaction to pop up, and I&#x27;m surprised that this company does not offer any sort of warning about the harsh ingredient that their product contains.</li>
            <li> I use is sparingly but have received several compliments (not on the make-up specifically but on the &#x27;look&#x27; in general).  </li>
            <li> Okay for two days, although my face appeared extremely greasy, so not thrilled with that.</li>
            <li> I saw Bare Minerals commercial and was hooked.  </li>
            <li> My wife simply loves her Bare Minerals kit that I got her.  </li>
            <li> finally I have decided to try bare minerals.</li>
            <li> so when I was running low on sheer cover I decided to try bare minerals...</li>
            <li> have very sensitive combination skin with dry areas, and Bare Minerals accentuated and clung to all the dry patches.</li>
            <li> The few that know the &#x27;secret&#x27; love the way it looks!  </li>
            <li> I tried bare minerals last month and have been using it every single day.</li>
            <li> I love the bare minerals foundation itself, but I hate these brushes so much I give this starter kit 2 stars.</li>
            <li> I can usually get by with just using the foundation, but for a more polished look I&#x27;ll also use the warmth (be careful, a little goes a long way) and finishing up with the Mineral Veil.</li>
            <li> When I got out in the natural light though, I noticed it was a little shiny and only got worse as the day went on.</li>
            <li> obviously know this makeup isn&#x27;t for everyone, and it&#x27;s a rather expensive leap to make, but if you think you sound anything like me, I definitely think you should try this line of products.</li>
            <li> I have been wanting to purchase their makeup for a long time and finally did.  </li>
            <li> I had no idea that it would go such a long ways.  </li>
            <li> At first I was a little shock at the price for such little make up.  </li>
            <li> I had wanted to try this make-up for a very long time,after reading several reveiws I decided to buy it.</li>
            <li> I have found out that I am also sensitive to Bismuth Oxychloride, so it wasn&#x27;t a huge disappointment.  </li>
            <li> and there is still one tiny dry patch on the side of my face that&#x27;s almost gone.  </li>
            <li> I might try the Matte formula during the warmer months when I don&#x27;t have such dry skin issues.</li>
            <li> I have figured that some of the products will last a very long time, but others maybe not as long (e.g. the &amp;#34;original&amp;#34; makeups and the &amp;#34;mineral veil&amp;#34;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> By the third morning, my skin started to itch and feel a bit rough.</li>
            <li> For those of you who wonders how long it lasts-</li>
            <li> Provides soft, even coverage without the heavy weight of liquid makeup.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if the company downsized, or if this is a different version  kit, but when she showed me her previous containers, they were much bigger.  </li>
            <li> For red spots, dark under eye circles, or scars: purchase the multipurpose powder in the shade, Well Rested, and apply it with the flat brush from the kit before proceeding with the foundation-</li>
            <li> the only other brush I would recommend buying is a Kabuki brush.</li>
            <li> I only use this method occasionally though because it seems to break out my skin a little.  </li>
            <li> i.d. barevitamins Skin Rever-upper, Prime Time foundation primer - plus all of the other things that I mentioned above that stayed in my makeup regime.  </li>
            <li> I had a little trouble getting the new click shaker part open correctly</li>
            <li> and it even helps dry out my pimples clearing my face in a couple of days.  </li>
            <li> So....being the sucker I am, I bought a high priced moisturizer and then the makeup primer - to no avail.</li>
            <li> Most make up makes me look yellow and sick.</li>
            <li> I use it as a travel kit because of the small sizes and a complete set of brushes.  </li>
            <li> The toner was too dark the regular face powder is what turned my face</li>
            <li> After she opened it we were surprised at how small the containers were in comparison to what she&#x27;s purchased before.  </li>
            <li> only down side is the expense of the BM line and that it&#x27;s not water proof.  </li>
            <li> BUT a few hours lately you can tell you put to much on because it starts to look cakey.  </li>
            <li> I use their pink eye shadow as blush.  </li>
            <li> They felt so scratchy and rough, even after washing.  </li>
            <li> Plus its only been a few days</li>
            <li> I have purchased 3 of these kits over the last few years.</li>
            <li> I started wearing mineral makeup a few years back when the spa I worked at sold it.</li>
            <li> My mom purchased this kit for herself last year, used it a few times and then stashed it in her closet because it made her face itch and flake.</li>
            <li> At first I thought this product might be a little too expensive to use regularly, but nope, one container lasts me about a year (and that&#x27;s wearing it every day.)</li>
            <li> What little blemishes do pop up are incredibly less red and inflamed than before.</li>
            <li> I have not worn makeup for the past 25 years but have recently started having problems with rosacea and wanted to cover the redness without looking like I was wearing makeup.</li>
            <li> The set I got from amazon (medium beige) included 2 foundation colors (I just use one of them because the other one isn&#x27;t my color at all-</li>
            <li> She quit using her other make up</li>
            <li> I will never wear any other make-up.</li>
            <li> They sent her an email saying it would be delayed slightly due to them updating their process.&lt;br</li>
            <li> (not the brush cleaner, some other makeup).  </li>
            <li> She said it had to go through their financial office and get this, they were not sure when this gift card would be active.</li>
            <li> A DVD was also included to give the novice a quick and dirty tutorial</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the all over color is too dark.</li>
            <li> break outs went way down</li>
            <li> So, I have heard about BM for the longest time, and because my dermatologist said that I need to use sunscreen (like what all the other magazines are saying too!)</li>
            <li> Once its out, I&#x27;m getting some other primer!</li>
            <li> Yes, but I am watching my Ulta points VERY carefully from now on!</li>
            <li> I had previously used this product for years.</li>
            <li> Noted references of Bismuth Oxychloride in previous reviews.</li>
            <li> My face had a slight rash and felt irritably dry.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am having less breakouts since I have started using this.  </li>
            <li> A little bit dark, but no biggy, I wasn&#x27;t planning on going anywhere</li>
            <li> Get Started Complexion Kit - Light: ( 2xFdn</li>
            <li> I have a few acne scars (dark spots)</li>
            <li> so therefore I just need a little and</li>
            <li> Just use a little or a lot for the coverage you desire</li>
            <li> Coverage can be as much or as little as you like.  </li>
            <li> A little goes along way</li>
            <li> Little</li>
            <li> I had such high hopes for this foundation, and I&#x27;m disappointed it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> name just a few.</li>
            <li> but it dried out my skin and made it look flaky.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t make my skin look cakey orshiny or dried it out.</li>
            <li> I am in my late 30&#x27;s and have never really worn make up.</li>
            <li> A few months ago I was going to my friend&#x27;s bridal shower, and I knew people would be taking pictures all day, so</li>
            <li> Got this for my wife for Christmas a few years ago.</li>
            <li> and solely wears this now, and loves it everyday.</li>
            <li> , I would use it when I went out the take it off as soon as I got home because it just felt too heavy and greasy on my face(i&#x27;d end up with a zit</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the look of the heavy concealer.  </li>
            <li> and i payed a few dollars</li>
            <li> *Can be messy, but what makeup isn&#x27;t?  </li>
            <li> I have been using bareMinerals for a few years now.</li>
            <li> I had wanted this product for a few years.</li>
            <li> I had a hard time filling in dark places like under my eyes, etc.</li>
            <li> I braved it, but it became too uncomfortable to bare.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical of bare minerals with the late night tv adds, and pushy mall vendors.</li>
            <li> I assumed since I lived in a small town that they didn&#x27;t have one, but they did.</li>
            <li> No more cystic acne.</li>
            <li> I usually use glo minerals pressed foundation and decided to try this product.</li>
            <li> so, based on the reviews, I opted for this starter kit since I&#x27;m not sure what goes where</li>
            <li> What a gigantic waste of money!  </li>
            <li> It is being offered as the same &amp;#34;Get Started Kit&amp;#34;; not only does it contain your basics: (</li>
            <li> not sure what she was supposed to get.</li>
            <li> asked if they usually sent out gift cards</li>
            <li> Wow - I knew I spent a lot on beauty products, but this is a REAL stinker.  </li>
            <li> I felt like I should at least try to look presentable.</li>
            <li> I never really liked foundation</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cover well at all, looks thick in some spots..and doesn&#x27;t even cover others.</li>
            <li> For me, shipping was slow--</li>
            <li> i mean i&#x27;ve been seeing it on the shelves</li>
            <li> When I told her that was pathetic customer service, she apologized for the first time in 3 phone calls.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the foundation: the medium was blendable, but not great.  </li>
            <li> Not happy with this product.</li>
            <li> So, I am not happy that my gift was not what it was supposed to be.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I want to take care of my skin, but this price point was tough.</li>
            <li> Additionally, after few days of using it I have got a bad skin reaction to its ingredients.</li>
            <li> BM has \\&quot;prime time\\&quot;, but its quite expensive.</li>
            <li> My husband, who has never commented on my makeup in eleven years of marriage, took one look at my face and said, \\&quot;What&#x27;s wrong with your makeup?</li>
            <li> Honestly, not impressed at all.</li>
            <li> a purpleish and the mineral shimmer coat thing was the only thing that wasn&#x27;t a horrible color</li>
            <li> maybe I am crazy, but that is the worse service I have ever had.</li>
            <li> I was getting tired of my cover up leaving a lard/ greasy feeling and the smell of powder cover up made me sick</li>
            <li> This was the biggest disappointment.</li>
            <li> I still have breakouts too :(  </li>
            <li> I was sorta disappointed that it didn&#x27;t cover as well as I wanted it to.</li>
            <li> I give it one star :(</li>
            <li> I hate them.</li>
            <li> All these morons on here complaining how it made them itchy??</li>
            <li> Within three days of use, my face broke out horribly in the worst allergic reaction I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> Terrible.    </li>
            <li> It was an awful experience to go through.  </li>
            <li> The brushes are awful.</li>
            <li> I am giving this a 2 star review because these brushes are so terrible.</li>
            <li> I would use, it always seemed to look terrible by the end of the day.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The best make up ever!!!!!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my sister for mothers day. She absolutely loved it! Great gift it helps her not feel so self conscious about her appearance. Win win :)</li>
            <li> I had previously used this product for years. Last fall, I took a short hiatus and returned only to have my skin react very badly--awful, red, bumpy patches/rash and swollen eyes. I did also buy a new moisturizer around the same time, so although I speculated that this may have been the culprit, I decided to try a bismuth-free makeup at my dermatologist&#x27;s suggestion. I did find a great bismuth-free mineral product, and I&#x27;ve been using it since. But as I tend to tan easily in the summer, I needed to change foundation shades recently and decided to give BM one more try, as I did like the finish of it.    Okay for two days, although my face appeared extremely greasy, so not thrilled with that. By the third morning, my skin started to itch and feel a bit rough. I discontinued immediately but the damage was done. Within three days of use, my face broke out horribly in the worst allergic reaction I&#x27;ve ever had. My skin became red and absolutely covered in tiny, itchy bumps. It took a good week to heal, which involved drying and flaking of the rashy patches (I know, very attractive). I&#x27;m two weeks out and there is still one tiny dry patch on the side of my face that&#x27;s almost gone.  Terrible.    I realize that not everyone has a reaction to bismuth-oxychloride, but keep in mind that I used this product religiously for years with NO problems until I stopped briefly and went back to it. Apparently a rection to the bismuth can come on at any time, and I&#x27;m lucky that I did not suffer from the cystic reaction that my dermatologist suggested some sufferers experience. In addition, in doing some digging online, I found that it is VERY common for this kind of reaction to pop up, and I&#x27;m surprised that this company does not offer any sort of warning about the harsh ingredient that their product contains. I&#x27;m very happy to say that ULTA allowed me to return the opened product, no questions asked, for a full refund.    So, just a word of caution to all, and a reminder that there are many other choices out there.</li>
            <li> I bought this set after my sister-in-law used her&#x27;s on me and she was able to cover up my rosacea pretty well.  I haven&#x27;t had such luck yet, but I need to play with it a little more.  I do agree, you need to put on some moisturizer first to get it to stick better.  I had a little trouble getting the new click shaker part open correctly but now I have.  I have fair skin and I bought the light/med shade.  I think it will help.</li>
            <li> I started using Bare Minerals after my daughter recommended it to me. I think it is wonderful. It doesn&#x27;t get in the creases of your face and no matter what your age you can be beautiful on a consistent basis.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 37 with oily skin.  I still have breakouts too :(  Though I have found nothing that makes the oily skin manageable.  I do think this product offers great coverage for red acne spots and over all smooth natural look.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and many times will have a break out on my face. Bare Minerals cover up any blemishes or red perfectly and it even helps dry out my pimples clearing my face in a couple of days.  Even though it is pricy it is a great buy.  My sister bought a kit and it lasted over a year!  This is a great buy for you money.  I totally recommend it!!</li>
            <li> I have not worn makeup for the past 25 years but have recently started having problems with rosacea and wanted to cover the redness without looking like I was wearing makeup. I love the Bare Escentuals products and would recommend it to anyone that wears makeup.</li>
            <li> The make up is beautiful. Today is day one. If unsual breakouts occur I will edit review. Noted references of Bismuth Oxychloride in previous reviews. Order received on 4/2 expected date was 4/8 extremely pleased. Thank you!</li>
            <li> This product was perfect and saved me from having to drive to the mall to get. Was so nice to just have it dropped off on my doorstep!</li>
            <li> I had wanted to try this make-up for a very long time,after reading several reveiws I decided to buy it.If you want good coverage for blemishes I wouldnt recommend this product.I wish I would have watched the reveiws on youtube BEFORE I made my purchase,because it turns out this product contains a chemical called bismuth oxide.And sure enough after using it for 3 days...I broke out. Pros: feels like your not wearing make-up.Cons: doesnt cover well and causes break outs for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of bare minerals with the late night tv adds, and pushy mall vendors. I was getting tired of my cover up leaving a lard/ greasy feeling and the smell of powder cover up made me sick so I switched to bare minerals granted its more than I used to spend but worth every penny it I started using it and I saw an improvement my skin and it highlights beautifully!! you will have a flawless air brush look and end us using less as time passes because you no longer need to cover up! break outs went way down you can use the brush shampoo as a face cleaner amazon has the lowest price and you can get the (prime time) for what you would spend on the kit at retail as a bonus! I love it!!</li>
            <li> No makeup is right for every person, but I&#x27;ve been using Bare Escentuals for over a year, and I&#x27;ve never had so many compliments on my skin.  I&#x27;m over 60.  It is the perfect makeup for me.  It covers my \\&quot;red\\&quot; perfectly, and never, ever feels like I&#x27;m wearing makeup.  I use their pink eye shadow as blush.  My daughter introduced me to it, and she uses it too.</li>
            <li> I bought this about 4 months ago and am hooked! This is THE makeup to buy! It goes on so smoothly, you can&#x27;t even tell you have makeup on. I have not broken out once since I started using this.</li>
            <li> This is not for dry, sensitive skin!  I tried this (from another store) after getting into minerals, and I tried to give it a chance, but...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1- the brushes: I could not use the brushes at all.  They felt so scratchy and rough, even after washing.  I had to use my own soft synthetic kabuki and powder brushes.  So, not a huge biggy, since most kits I&#x27;d imagine have cheap brushes.  So, I used my own...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2- the foundation: the medium was blendable, but not great.  A little bit dark, but no biggy, I wasn&#x27;t planning on going anywhere so I could test it out. I used my own moisturizer, since I have sensitive skin, and I allowed it to set in like usual.  BE foundation was blendable with using light layers, but coverage was light and not great...a bit shiny (not glow from within...it was shiny).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3- the finish powder/veil: didn&#x27;t use this since it contains Zea Mays (cornstarch).  I am very sensitive to cornstarch.  It causes breakouts and further dryness with me (that I don&#x27;t need).  So, I skipped it..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the foundation test was done...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 minutes later: my face started getting a very mild stinging warm sensation that would increase until it got to the point that I HAD to remove it (about 10 minutes after the start).  I braved it, but it became too uncomfortable to bare.  So, off the BE went with washing my face in gentle cleanser.  My face had a slight rash and felt irritably dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mineral Cosmetics are great, but BE bareMinerals I find to be too harsh for me.  I have found out that I am also sensitive to Bismuth Oxychloride, so it wasn&#x27;t a huge disappointment.  BE helped me find another ingredient that I can&#x27;t use in cosmetics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other Mineral Cosmetics (that don&#x27;t contain bismuth oxychloride) that work with my sensitive skin...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mineral Essence [[ASIN:B001O0VFI6 Mineral Essence Transform Me Collection 10 piece]]&lt;br /&gt;Lumiere Cosmetics by Lumiere Skin &amp; Beauty Bar&lt;br /&gt;Jane Iredale [[ASIN:B001TBM9BW Jane Iredale Sample Kit - Medium]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;to name just a few.</li>
            <li> This is a great way to get started w. bareMinerals.  I got this for a friend to start her w/ bareMinerals.  She&#x27;s hooked now too. :)</li>
            <li> Very light makeup, if you don&#x27;t need heavy base this is a great product.  I have a good tan so therefore I just need a little and it is great.  Very light doesn&#x27;t feel heavy but covers spots that need covering.</li>
            <li> So, I have heard about BM for the longest time, and because my dermatologist said that I need to use sunscreen (like what all the other magazines are saying too!) I decided to look into it-im 17 btw. Never having used make up before, I say that it&#x27;s quite easy to put on, and unless you want it to disappear mid-day, I say get a primer. BM has \\&quot;prime time\\&quot;, but its quite expensive. Once its out, I&#x27;m getting some other primer! For those of you who wonders how long it lasts- it depends entirely on how much coverage you need, and how much you put on. Sure, if you cake on BM, it will last like one or two months. I put it on enough to get even coverage and sunscreen protection. I predict one foundation of BM will last me about 4-5 months,the \\&quot;warmth\\&quot; will last longer because no one uses it more than foundation unless they want to look like Snooki, and the veil will last a bit longer than the foundation-once again, depends on how much shimmer you want.     The set I got from amazon (medium beige) included 2 foundation colors (I just use one of them because the other one isn&#x27;t my color at all- I will probably end up mixing in \\&quot;warmth\\&quot; to make it darker for my skin), 1 \\&quot;warmth\\&quot; (which is like the sun-kissed light bronzer that I love to use on my checks, forehead and chin), 1 brush cleaner tube (hugee tube!), 1 \\&quot;veil\\&quot; (which is a light shimmerly looking powder, almost whitesh pink that you put on last to pick up oils on your face and its suppose to give you a finished, glowey look ..which it does!), and 3 brushes (they are so soft, but I&#x27;m switching to organic brushes personally. The biggest is used for foundation and \\&quot;veil\\&quot; only, the second biggest is for \\&quot;warmth\\&quot;, and the tiny brush is for added touch up of scars or what not-I never use it) and all this comes with a CD with Leslie putting makeup on people and advertising ALLL her products (of course) and a cute black box that has it all.     *oh, and a tip i found from BM website is that if your foundation is too light for you- mix in a tiny bit of \\&quot;warmth\\&quot; to make it darker    *another tip: check out your local area for BM products, they do sell them in stores. I assumed since I lived in a small town that they didn&#x27;t have one, but they did. People there might be able to help you pick out your shade if you&#x27;re having trouble.     *Good luck guys!</li>
            <li> I have used other mineral products but I like this one best. My only complaint is the all over color is too dark.</li>
            <li> I purchased the starter kit in Fairly Light at a Sephora store after having a makeover that looked really great...in the store. I walked out excited to have discovered a foundation that was good for my skin, felt lightweight but gave moderate coverage, and didn&#x27;t sink into my fine lines. When I got out in the natural light though, I noticed it was a little shiny and only got worse as the day went on. This \\&quot;luminous\\&quot; quality of the Original formula isn&#x27;t for me.  My husband, who has never commented on my makeup in eleven years of marriage, took one look at my face and said, \\&quot;What&#x27;s wrong with your makeup? It&#x27;s kind of white or something.\\&quot; I can&#x27;t say how the Matte version would work, it might be better.&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive combination skin with dry areas, and Bare Minerals accentuated and clung to all the dry patches. It did in fact have a whitish tint in those areas, and that was after prepping my face with quite a bit of moisturizer (which doesn&#x27;t come with the starter kit) and the primer that was included in the kit. My skin didn&#x27;t break out, and the coverage was natural and pretty, but I can&#x27;t deal with the dry skin issue or the shiny/shimmery look. I had such high hopes for this foundation, and I&#x27;m disappointed it didn&#x27;t work for me. I might try the Matte formula during the warmer months when I don&#x27;t have such dry skin issues.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and love it!  It&#x27;s so light and easy to apply  You can&#x27;t beat this price for the brushes and products included.</li>
            <li> I had been using sheer cover and was very happy with it but it dried out my skin and made it look flaky. Well I don&#x27;t like using liquid foundations so when I was running low on sheer cover I decided to try bare minerals...the fist time I used I knew I would never go back! It didn&#x27;t make my skin look cakey orshiny or dried it out. Its amazing and makes my skin feel soft and beautiful! This product is a one of a kind and I&#x27;m sticking with it. Sheer cover gave great coverage and if it rained I still looked okay, it fall and hasn&#x27;t rained yet so I don&#x27;t know how bare minerals will hold up but so far its a 5 star!!! Yay  Ok I&#x27;m adding this, it rained and the makeup help up beautifully!!! Plus its only been a few days and my skin feels smoother, looks clearer and some scars are actually disapearing...now I don&#x27;t know if its the makeup or what bit since bearminerals..life is just better jaja!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so in love with this product. i mean i&#x27;ve been seeing it on the shelves and I&#x27;ve read some good reviews about mineral products but to try it on was something different.&lt;br /&gt;Even my beauty consultant didn&#x27;t believe i wasn&#x27;t wearing a cream foundation! its so light on the skin, easy to create the exact tone you feel like appearing into every morning and cover the pores very naturally.</li>
            <li> I purchased this Bare Minerals starter kit at the beginning of the year and can honestly say I will never go back to my old makeup. It gives you all the brushes and face makeup powders you need in order to test the waters a bit. I was able to find exactly which items within the starter kit work best for me. I loved ow easy it was to use and how concise the instructions were. I in fact, still use the box to hold my bare minerals powers, etc. Great product, would highly recommend it to anyone and I have already recommended it to many of my friends and family. LOVE!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used clinique and their lotions every since I started wearing makeup.  I saw Bare Minerals commercial and was hooked.  It was supposed to be good for my sensitive skin, would cover my melasma, etc.  I bought the product, applied it that morning around 9 am.  I have to say, I looked like a movie star, my melasma and my red cheecks were gone.  However, about 11:30 am, I needed a touchup and by 12:00 noon my face started burning and itching.  I could not get Bare Minerals off my face fast enough.  When I finally got it off, I had a sunburn look for 4 days.  I had to go back to clinique and buy their comfort on call, to calm my burning and itchy face that same afternoon.  It was an awful experience to go through.  The great news is I got my money back.</li>
            <li> You will LOVE LOVE LOVE this starter kit.     First of all..you get the ESSENTIAL makeup brushes with the kit...the only other brush I would recommend buying is a Kabuki brush. You also receive 2 shades of foundation, warmth and mineral veil which are the essential items you need for your face. I actually use the medium beige foundation, but find that the lighter shade is a perfect concealor. Plus the kit gives you a sample of primer which I probably would not have even tried if it weren&#x27;t for the sample kit and primer is a MUST HAVE for mineral makeup.     I have purchased 3 of these kits over the last few years. The first kit was my initial starter kit. I ended up purchasing a 2nd kit for myself when my makeup brushes just got to the point of replacement and it was more economical for me to purchase a starter kit rather than each brush individually (I use all the brushes in the starter kit). I recently purchased a 3rd kit as a \\&quot;travel kit.\\&quot; I am back and forth to the gym regularly and I tend to stay at my boyfriends place quite often, so I find it easier to have a 2nd makeup bag for toteing around and the starter kit is a perfect travel kit.    As for the makeup itself...once you get the hang of using it, you WILL love it as much as I do. The key to making it work is primer, foundation, warmth and mineral veil and you MUST invest in a kabuki brush (I actually recommend both the small fat kabuki brush and the handy buki brush). Watch the video and I promise you will get the hang of it...I can&#x27;t even wear liquid foundation anymore...my skin actually burns when I put it on and I am guaranteed to have a breakout.</li>
            <li> Ladies, if you&#x27;re looking for something to replace your foundation, this probably isn&#x27;t it. I had a hard time filling in dark places like under my eyes, etc. with just the powder. Plus, it wouldn&#x27;t stick unless my face was really uberly moisturized. So I kept a super greasy moisturizer in the box to remind myself to hydrate before using. The only I thought was good was the bronzer.</li>
            <li> I am in my late 30&#x27;s and have never really worn make up. My husband wanted me to get it and I did. I was able to figure out how to use it by myself, the DVD was a waste of time. If you know how to apply make up, you&#x27;re set.&lt;br /&gt;I wish it came with blush. It gives ok coverage and you don&#x27;t look like you&#x27;re wearing make up.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Received the make up in a very timely matter.  The invoice included with the product showed the billed price of $94.57, however, when I checked my credit card statement it was billed properly at $45.49.  They also have included a free eye liner.</li>
            <li> I started wearing mineral makeup a few years back when the spa I worked at sold it. When I started running out I realized I couldnt order that makeup anymore since it was only sold at spas. I asked around and decided to try it. I couldn&#x27;t be happier. The make up goes on smooth and it is really easy to use. I love the videos to help you apply it as well. The coverage is great as well. I can&#x27;t get over how much my skin has improved since I have been using it.</li>
            <li> I love the Bare Escentuals products. Since I have been using it. I have had fewer breakouts and it gives me the best coverage.</li>
            <li> My mom purchased this kit for herself last year, used it a few times and then stashed it in her closet because it made her face itch and flake. I haven&#x27;t worn make-up for years and have struggled with moderate to severe acne since I was 12. A few months ago I was going to my friend&#x27;s bridal shower, and I knew people would be taking pictures all day, so I felt like I should at least try to look presentable. I didn&#x27;t have any makeup of my own, so I took some of the junk my mom had, since she wasn&#x27;t going to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You probably aren&#x27;t even going to believe me, but almost immediately upon contact my skin began clearing up. I do not know what it is about this stuff, but my skin is in love. No more cystic acne. What little blemishes do pop up are incredibly less red and inflamed than before. I think the reduced inflammation has been the greatest benefit. I like the coverage. I&#x27;m used to not wearing any makeup for fear that I might cause another breakout, and I think this makeup looks natural and still covers my acne marks well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I obviously know this makeup isn&#x27;t for everyone, and it&#x27;s a rather expensive leap to make, but if you think you sound anything like me, I definitely think you should try this line of products.</li>
            <li> I am a 36 year old, ex smoker with old acne scarring and sun damage. I was using Mary Kay mineral makeup and a friend suggested Bare Minerals. Mary Kay is a very nice product and I would still use it but Bare Minerals does look very natural, great coverage without looking like you have any make up on. Just looks like you have a great complexion!</li>
            <li> Got a set of this for Christmas. The make up has improved my skin. I would get frequent break outs and they have all but stopped since I have been using this kit. The only negative comment is that they eye shadow needs to be reapplied quite a bit through the day, but the mineral veil is simply wonderful!</li>
            <li> The product junkies are great to buy from!!! I got my product fast, and it was exactly what i ordered. As for the bare minerals, it is great!!! I love the way it covers, and feels.</li>
            <li> I usually use glo minerals pressed foundation and decided to try this product. Honestly, not impressed at all. It doesn&#x27;t cover well at all, looks thick in some spots..and doesn&#x27;t even cover others. The brushes are awful. It also very very messy so make sure you have a towel under it while applying it. Not happy with this product. I will be going back to glo minerals.</li>
            <li> I love bareMinerals.  I have been wanting to purchase their makeup for a long time and finally did.  I wasn&#x27;t sure if I just should just get the foundation or the starter kit but the kit was definitely worth it.  I am pretty fair but the medium is just right for me, it adds a little bit of \\&quot;tan\\&quot; without looking fake or to made up.  The make up does feel light but coverage is good.  I gave it only 4 stars because I do have some problem areas that I need to apply a little bit of liquid foundation before the bareMinerals because I don&#x27;t think coverage is good enough for my chin and around my nose.  Still all around a great buy.</li>
            <li> Have always wanted to try this makeup, finally was able to, and I love it!!!  Goes on great, stays all day.</li>
            <li> I am giving this a 2 star review because these brushes are so terrible. I hate them. For as popular a brand that bare minerals is you would think they could put a little more effort into their brush making. I stand over the sink and apply my bare minerals foundation and by the time I am done it looks like a man has shaved his beard over the sink and my top is covered in dozens of tiny little hairs. I love the bare minerals foundation itself, but I hate these brushes so much I give this starter kit 2 stars.</li>
            <li> This is the find of the century.  After buying BM at the mall and paying $$$$$ for this product I needed a refill.  I found everything I needed and more at such a low price.  Everything came in on time and perfect - this is how I will buy this product from now on. 5 Stars!</li>
            <li> I tried Bare Minerals years ago, don&#x27;t know why I stopped. I ordered the Get Started Kit and the products were just like I remembered. They brush on so smoothly and last all day. The warmth is not really a blush, it doesn&#x27;t fit into any other catagory but it&#x27;s the finishing touch. My skin tone is olive with red undertones. Most make up makes me look yellow and sick. The Bare Minerals beige works with my skin tone and makes me look healthy.</li>
            <li> I tried bare minerals last month and have been using it every single day. I have acne scars and the powder covers it really well. It feels really light on your face and you only need to use a bit and your flaws will go away. The brushes are really good quality with no bad smells unlike other brushes I&#x27;ve used before. Make sure when you use the blush that you only use a tiny bit and I recommend that you tap a bit on your hand first because it is EXTREMELY strong, but if you put the right amount on it looks lovely.</li>
            <li> After having a baby and losing the &#x27;glow&#x27; I wanted something to highlight what was left-lol.  Also, I don&#x27;t wear make-up but will be turning 30 soon and feeling a bit &#x27;blah&#x27; so, based on the reviews, I opted for this starter kit since I&#x27;m not sure what goes where and the instructional DVD was very helpful. I have good skin so I wanted something light that &#x27;accentuated&#x27; not covered and this worked well.  I only use the warmth and the veil as I found the foundation to be a bit much and felt heavy on my face (a bit itchy too). I use is sparingly but have received several compliments (not on the make-up specifically but on the &#x27;look&#x27; in general).  The few that know the &#x27;secret&#x27; love the way it looks!  I should add that I am black and have what can be best described as &#x27;brown sugar&#x27; colored skin and had no trouble matching as I know women of color often do with make-up (at least from what I read).  I live abroad so I ordered from a different site, but I like the product and will continue to use it. It blends well and I&#x27;d recommend it to the &#x27;not so make-upy&#x27; gals!</li>
            <li> This was the biggest disappointment. I am 41 and I made this purchase because I believed the hype over this product. I liked the colors in the product line, and was in the mood for a change. My skin has always been good. I never had acne,I&#x27;ve never been into tanning,  and everyone tells me I look much younger than my age. Well let me tell you, this is the first review I&#x27;ve ever written because I feel soooo ripped off by this product. The colors were perfect for me, that&#x27;s true, but after the first use, I noticed my skin was COVERED with fine lines, and looked very, very dry! So....being the sucker I am, I bought a high priced moisturizer and then the makeup primer - to no avail. No matter how much I want to love this makeup, it makes my skin look 20 years older. I told a co worker about it, and she said she&#x27;d tried it and found the same thing to be true. So its back to Covergirl for me. What a gigantic waste of money!  [[ASIN:B001VA8PWI bareMinerals Get Started Kit with Bonus Gift - Medium]]</li>
            <li> I have been using BareMinerals for several years now and needed some more and found the bareMinerals Get Started Kit with Bonus Gift - Medium to give me new brushes too. Will keep buying BM.</li>
            <li> This is a great product ! I was surprised to see so any items included in the package. Loved the starter kit and will definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> finally I got the right foundation that fits in my skin.  Just one apply and never used a pressed powder all day[[ASIN:B001VA8PWI bareMinerals Get Started Kit with Bonus Gift - Medium]]</li>
            <li> I had never tried bareMinerals before and thought I would give it a try.  I absolutely love it!!  It goes on like silk and it feels like it too.  Never would have guessed it would be so smooth on your face.  The only thing I wish they had larger containers.  Great product and I highly recommend anyone to try this. Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> This is makeup that doesn&#x27;t look like you are wearing makeup. Very quick to put on.  It very nicely evens tones on the skin without build up.  The \\&quot;warmth\\&quot; gives dimension and warmth :). Expensive, but nicely packaged, and high quality.  For me, shipping was slow-- but otherwise great!</li>
            <li> This is one of the best purchases I have made in ages, the package shipped very quickly and was here within a week of my placing the order. It was packed very well, and I really don&#x27;t have any qualms about it. The product is incredible; I have acne problems and the foundation I am used to using only seems to break me out more and always feels caked on. It left residue on my hands if I touched my face after applying it. I felt like I needed something better, and Bare Minerals is the product I was looking for. Application is easy and fun, I feel like a professional when I use the high-quality brushes. The one thing I don&#x27;t think I needed so much was the warmth powder, but I believe that may be because it&#x27;s fall now and looking darker isn&#x27;t as important. The combination of the foundation and mineral veil together leaves my face feeling like it can move, I no longer feel I look like the Joker when I leave the house! As for the bonus gift (gloss and mascara), I ADORE THEM! The mascara opens up my lashes wide and full, I feel like a model from the 40s almost. As for the gloss, I never wear it. This gloss, is a different story. Not sticky, but also doesn&#x27;t wear off in 20 minutes of my putting it on. Doesn&#x27;t make my lips chapped and is a great color that seems would suit everyone&#x27;s lips! Thank you to Bare Minerals for making such an incredible product, and thanks to the seller for making it accessible, affordable, and for such quick delivery. I will be buying again. :)</li>
            <li> Got this for my wife for Christmas a few years ago. She was very surprised that I would find and buy her this.She loved it!</li>
            <li> My wife simply loves her Bare Minerals kit that I got her.  She quit using her other make up and solely wears this now, and loves it everyday.</li>

            <li> Buying Bare Escentuals is one of the best things I&#x27;ve ever done. I love it!!! I don&#x27;t even know where to begin it has so many positives to it...I love that you get the   cd with it, that really helped me...Its easy, fast, looks great..what else could a woman want? I will never wear any other make-up. I actually look forward to putting it on every day, just to look at the results...Its Great!!!   I&#x27;d like to thank you for the opportunity to voice my opinion on this. It is a 5 star product and on a scale of 1-10 it rates 11.....  Thank you so much for you time.                     A Bare Escentuals Woman for Life,                                               Patti B.</li>
            <li> This was my first time trying mineral makeup and I love it. I never really liked foundation, I would use it when I went out the take it off as soon as I got home because it just felt too heavy and greasy on my face(i&#x27;d end up with a zit the next day).I got this about a month ago and have been using it every day.. It feels so light, clean and I havent gotten one zit so far.. It&#x27;s like I have nothing on!!!</li>
            <li> I recently bought this make up because a family member of mine uses it and loves it. So I decided to try it, was a little bit skeptical at first because i just couldnt see how a powder could be a good foundation with coverage. I was wrong, this stuff is great, it has excellent coverage, very lightweight, and looks totally natural. I will not go back to liquid foundation ever again. I have found a new make-up. Will recommend to everyone that I know.</li>
            <li> I will never use liquid make up again.  This product is the \\&quot;bomb\\&quot;....Just love it...Do not get suckered into the imitations.  Just use a little or a lot for the coverage you desire</li>
            <li> I love this makeup.  I was using a powder foundation before this, and this stuff is amazing.  It took me about 2 weeks to get the application and coverage as I like.  I am having less breakouts since I have started using this.  The blemish coverage is really good, better than I expected with the special brush.  Before I would have to use a concealer often to cover up blemishes, and I did not use anything under eyes at I don&#x27;t like the look of the heavy concealer.  This stuff covers up flaws flawlessly.  It does take me a bit longer to apply my makeup, but I am covering up more flaws like under eyes, redness on chin and nose.  It really lasts throughout the day, occasionally I will retouch.  I am also using the prime time foundation primer, and I have used my makeup without it also, and prime time does help the minerals look better, so I do use it every day.  I wish I would have started using this stuff years ago.  This does not compare to any of the name brand mineral makeups that are put out by covergirl, neutogena...etc.</li>
            <li> The starter kit gives you almost everything that you need.  I use it as a travel kit because of the small sizes and a complete set of brushes.  It is a great product</li>
            <li> I was very excited to recieve my order. I was pleasantly surprised. The brushes are very nice. I usually don&#x27;t use finishing powder on my skin, but the bare mineral starter kit was so light on my skin. I liked the feeling on my face. It blended well and gave the appearance of very natural skin.

            <li> I have used BareMinerals for many years.  My daughters and granddaughters use the BareMinerals products also.  What a range in ages, me 68, my youngest granddaughter is 17.  We use the same makeup!  Coverage can be as much or as little as you like.  We have found all the BareMinerals products to me great!</li>
            <li> I ordered this product as a Christmas present for my sister. It was shipped to me so I could wrap it. I got the package, the box looked legitimate and I wrapped it up. Much to my surprise, my sister called me Christmas morning not sure what she was supposed to get. The box said one thing and all she got in the box was three brushes and three tubes. No makeup. So, I am not happy that my gift was not what it was supposed to be.</li>
            <li> i ordered this for my maimee mama and she has been using it for a while and she loves it and i have used it but to me it is alittle over prices it isnt that great i went to walmart and bout some mabaleen mouse fondation it doesnt feel any different on my face and u cant tell im wearing fondation and i payed a few dollars so how bout them apples</li>
            <li> I never leave reviews. EVER. However, this product has earned my respect after 5 or 6 years of use. I have combination skin with occasional moderate acne.  Pros:  *Great coverage especially with the concealer brush.  *SUPER easy to blend.  *GREAT VALUE. A little goes along way and I buy it infrequently. The starter kits really are a great value especially with the brushes.  Cons:  *Your pores can look larger.  *Easy to apply too much. You try adding a little more and buffing to get the airbrush look which it does give you BUT a few hours lately you can tell you put to much on because it starts to look cakey.  *Can be messy, but what makeup isn&#x27;t?  TIPS:  *If your pores still look large after applying a light amount, spray your face lighting with a light misting finishing spray or I use Avian (water) spray.  It \\&quot;melts\\&quot; your makeup giving you way smoother appearance. Use the spray and come back in 5 minutes. If you still aren&#x27;t happy with your coverage, then you can apply more.  *For large pores you can try aveeno tinted moisturizer which \\&quot;fills in\\&quot; your pores before applying your mineral foundation. I only use this method occasionally though because it seems to break out my skin a little.  *Apply a moisturizer, let dry,and then add a primer. I like they&#x27;re newest prime time brightening primer.</li>
            <li> I recommend this to anyone who will listen.  Price is great and the product is an excellent makeup that anyone can use.</li>
            <li> I love Bare Minerals make-up and will not wear anything else. The powders give my skin an even tone while minimizing the appearance of fine lines and pores. I habitually sleep without washing my make-up off, but do not get break outs. Best of all- because the Bare Minerals look is so natural, most people think I have beautiful skin rather than a made up face.    Do not be put off by the $60 price to get started. The powders last and last because application requires only a tiny amount. I looked up the full prices of all the items included in the Get Started Kit on the Bare Escentuals website [...] The ala carte price for the items in the kit runs just over $142 so you get a bargain with the $60 kit.    Some reviewers expressed a desire for a look with more coverage. If your coverage is too light, simply apply more layers of powder until your desired look is achieved and buff with the fluffy brush. For red spots, dark under eye circles, or scars: purchase the multipurpose powder in the shade, Well Rested, and apply it with the flat brush from the kit before proceeding with the foundation- simply gorgeous!

            <li> This made my skin feel nice but it turned my skin a purple hue. I have medium toned skin and therefor got the medium colored make up it did not go with my skin tone at all. The toner was too dark the regular face powder is what turned my face a purpleish and the mineral shimmer coat thing was the only thing that wasn&#x27;t a horrible color and it didn&#x27;t make an impact by itself. Wish I hadn&#x27;t bought this.</li>
            <li> I have been eying the BM makeup line for a while and after finding the lowest price on Amazon.com I made my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;The kit includes what you need to get started with foundation, not your eyes, lips or foundation primer.  A DVD was also included to give the novice a quick and dirty tutorial but I found more helpful tutorials from users on YouTube to be more helpful.  The DVD was more of an advertisement for their other products, which I will admit I bought some of them later on and enjoy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To &#x27;master&#x27; this makeup you need time.  I followed the instructions in the DVD and wasn&#x27;t happy with the coverage.  After seeing how some other users applied the makeup on YouTube I start to deviate from the BMs method and found my own.  After a week of trial &amp; error I have found my ideal coverage method and started to enjoy the flexibility of experimenting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I really like is no longer having the makeup line.  Even if I apply too much I can still buff it out so it evens out.  Just watch how much of the Warmth you use, it&#x27;s very easy to over do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only down side is the expense of the BM line and that it&#x27;s not water proof.  I have found the best ways to build a stock pile of BM makeup &amp; brushes are through the tutorial kits which are best priced on Ebay or Amazon.  The foundation is not waterproof but some of the mascara&#x27;s are so try not to wet your hands and wipe your face on warm summer days.</li>
            <li> Great starter set. My skin has cleared up so much since I started using it. Only about 3 weeks ago!</li>
            <li> What a great buy.  I love this light weight makeup.  I can fall asleep with it on and not wake up to acne in the morning.</li>
            <li> I got the medium tone started kit and was excited to try it out. I was sorta disappointed that it didn&#x27;t cover as well as I wanted it to. The brushes are fantastic, especially the small cover-all brush. I am using my regular foundation and putting the medium foundation on top and polishing it off with the bronzer and veil. This seems to work a lot better. The product is definately sheer.</li>
            <li> Hi Guys,&lt;br /&gt;So finally I have decided to try bare minerals. I purchased it from Amazon and after first time I have used it, the coverage was ok, not the best (I have used better foundations before). Additionally, after few days of using it I have got a bad skin reaction to its ingredients. I give it one star :(</li>
            <li> I am writing a review because I had to deal with their corporate office. My sister ordered a gift card for me on July 4, 2012. They sent her an email saying it would be delayed slightly due to them updating their process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally received the gift card on July 26, 2012 (which they charged her $6 for expedited shipping) and went to use it online only to be told it was invalid. I called customer service who verified that the number was coming up invalid and was told I needed to speak to their corporate office.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Corporate called me back today (3 times). They found that there was a glitch in their financial system that they were aware of for the last 10 days and said my sister had not yet been charged for this gift card and that was why it did not work (WTH?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I asked if they usually sent out gift cards 22 days after they were ordered that were not loaded. She said it had to go through their financial office and get this, they were not sure when this gift card would be active. When I told her that was pathetic customer service, she apologized for the first time in 3 phone calls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now maybe I am crazy, but that is the worse service I have ever had. I immediately called my sister to let her know. She called the number to cancel the order and they said she couldn&#x27;t (LOL) because it was still going to go through, to which she told them she would be disputing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the lesson here is, NEVER, EVER order a gift card through this company. And even though the make-up is pretty, it is not worth the hassle of having to deal with the company!</li>
            <li> Wow is all I can say.  First, got to my house, in 3 days of ordering it!  Great time.  I was so excited to put it on for work this morning and I feel like i look amazing!  (who knows what others think lol)  But it was simple to use, made my skin look great, I feel great, very impressed.  Recommended it already!</li>
            <li> This kit is wonderful but be aware that it doesn&#x27;t contain the primer, the tube you see in the picture is the washing soap for the brushes. ;) Apart from this the product is really good and I will buy it again. The only thing I would recommend is to buy a kabubi brush for the darker shades!</li>
            <li> This product lives up to it&#x27;s promise.&lt;br /&gt;I have friends who use it and I wanted to try it.&lt;br /&gt; I love it.  It looks good and feels good.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy it again and again.</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift for my wife, she had it on her list.  She loves this makeup and wanted all new brushes, so she asked for another &amp;#34;starter kit&amp;#34;.  After she opened it we were surprised at how small the containers were in comparison to what she&#x27;s purchased before.  I don&#x27;t know if the company downsized, or if this is a different version  kit, but when she showed me her previous containers, they were much bigger.  there was one additional thing in this package, but she wasn&#x27;t sure what it was - maybe they substituted that for more of the other things?  (not the brush cleaner, some other makeup).  I guess next time I will read the sizes in the description more closely, or just go to Sephora in person to pick this up.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for someone and can&#x27;t really rate this so I guess it&#x27;s working for them.</li>
            <li> Item as described, great price. Reached on time. My wife simply loves this makeup. The only thing is, the box that is was packaged in was way too big. You could easily fit 5-6 of the starter kit in it!</li>
            <li> I have been using bareMinerals for a few years now. Before, I would wear drugstore products...and then, only when I had to (like if I was going somewhere special and wanted to look nice.) I just didn&#x27;t like the way makeup felt on my face, it was a hassle to have to deal with, and I had pretty good skin anyway. As I have gotten older, I&#x27;ve developed quite a bit of redness on my cheeks, and my skin seems to alternate between oily and extremely dry. I have also been more prone to breakouts (go figure, I never had this problem in high school lol.) Anyway, I saw the commercial, saw how well it covered redness, and when I saw bareMinerals for sale in a sort-of-nearby town, I decided to give it a shot. What a difference the very first time I used it! Easy to apply, completely covered up the redness, and I didn&#x27;t have that heavy makeup feel. I started to use it regularly, and haven&#x27;t had any breakouts at all. I went from being someone who couldn&#x27;t be bothered with makeup to someone who won&#x27;t leave the house without her bareMinerals on. I can usually get by with just using the foundation, but for a more polished look I&#x27;ll also use the warmth (be careful, a little goes a long way) and finishing up with the Mineral Veil. At first I thought this product might be a little too expensive to use regularly, but nope, one container lasts me about a year (and that&#x27;s wearing it every day.) Definitely worth the money!! Oh, and the compliments I get on what great skin I have don&#x27;t hurt either!</li>
            <li> Great way to be introduced to the product. I found the DVD helpful. The brushes are fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;It arrived quickly</li>
            <li> Gift for my daughter, ho really likes their products and who I started her first makeup years ago with this company.</li>
            <li> Great set to get you started.  LOVE this powder!  Provides soft, even coverage without the heavy weight of liquid makeup.</li>
            <li> a little pricey good but not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Since the day I can remember, I have always had troubles with my oily skin.  It did not matter which make up I would use, it always seemed to look terrible by the end of the day.  When I told a friend of the troubles I was having with my skin, she told me about The Get Started Kit by Bare Minerals.  So I decided I would give it a try and see how it worked for me.  At first I was a little shock at the price for such little make up.  Little did I know that the makeup would last me nearly an entire year.  I had no idea that it would go such a long ways.  On top of that, it completely changed the effects of my skin.  I no longer broke out because of my oily skin, my skin stayed great throughout the entire day, it felt so wonderful and light, and finally it turned out to be cheap considering of all the times you have to run to the store to buy more makeup.  I would recommend this Kit for all out there.  I thought I would never see the day when I liked my skin, and today I can say that I now love it.</li>
            <li> I had wanted this product for a few years. Finally went for it.  I think this product is easy to use and it feels light on the skin.  Very natural looking.  [[ASIN:B001VA8PWI bareMinerals Get Started Kit with Bonus Gift - Medium]]</li>
            <li> I was VERY hesitant to fork out this kind of money on makeup. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I want to take care of my skin, but this price point was tough. I had been getting by pretty cheap on drug store makeup, but I thought it was time to pay attention to what I was slathering on my face everyday. So, I bit the bullet.  I am a 35-40yr old female with a medium complexion.  I have a few acne scars (dark spots) and I have sebacious cysts that can act up from time to time.  I would like to give you a comparison of what products I used before to what I moved to as well as pros/cons for me.  Please don&#x27;t respond how crappy the makeup I used before was - I still actually think it is/was pretty good - especially for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the items in my makeup regime stayed the same: Olay microsculpting cream, Lancome Hypnose mascara, 100% Pure organic coffee bean undereye cream, Covergirl Line Exact liquid eyeliner, Target makeup removal wipes and some cleansers; and some I replaced:  Covergirl Simply Ageless makeup, Covergirl Instant Cheekbones Blush, Neutrogena Skin Blends Natural Radiance Bronzer, and Various eyeshadows.  I had always used the brushes that came with the products I bought, plus a large blusher brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the switch I am now using:  The bareMinerals Get Started Kit (2 originals, 1 warmth, 1 mineral veil, 3 brushes and a brush cleanser), ReadyTM eyeshadow (the Truth), Well-rested for eyes, Ready TM Blush (the One), i.d. barevitamins Skin Rever-upper, Prime Time foundation primer - plus all of the other things that I mentioned above that stayed in my makeup regime.  I am spending QUITE a bit more than what I did before on the makeup part (almost $75 more overall - yikes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  I really like the colors offered in the eyeshadow and blush.  I like the light feel of the bareMinerals makeup.  The makeup seems to stay on all day and I can honestly say my dark marks get covered completely (even in a close up photo!).  The medium shade blends well with my skin tone and I feel like my pores around my nose are smaller.  It is a more natural look.  It seems like many of the items will last a long time (e.g. I think the blush,eyeshadow, Warmth, Well-rested for eyes, as well as the Prime Time will last a very long time).  I liked that the products had a DVD to show you how to apply and even the eyeshadows had a diagram on how to use.  I don&#x27;t notice any of the shine I sometimes get by the middle of the day - just a more natural look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  COST.  Wow - I knew I spent a lot on beauty products, but this is a REAL stinker.  In rating the product itself, I&#x27;d give it a 5, but for the cost I HAD to knock it down a point (maybe should have knocked it more - it is super pricey having gone from drug store brands!).  I have figured that some of the products will last a very long time, but others maybe not as long (e.g. the &amp;#34;original&amp;#34; makeups and the &amp;#34;mineral veil&amp;#34;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will I buy again?  Yes, but I am watching my Ulta points VERY carefully from now on!</li>
            <li> Love this makeup! I found the right make up to cover my lupus and told my cousins about it they have Lupus. Also my cousins  like it</li>
