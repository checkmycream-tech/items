            <li>but I liked it.</li>
            <li>It smells nice, seems to speed up the tanning process, and has a bronzing effect.  </li>
            <li>&quot; kind of thing.</li>
            <li>but it for sure smells good.</li>
            <li>Brings out nice tone on my skin.</li>
            <li>I own my own tanning bed and have been tanning for years.</li>
            <li>It smells great, the bronzers turn you brown (not orange), and the end result is great color, and fast.</li>

            <li>Leaves skin with a nice tan color and moisturizing.</li>

            <li>I use this in an upgrade bed which i used to burn in, and now using this lotion i can see very good results, very good price alot better than buying in the salon which is double the price.  </li>
            <li>Not only does it have a pleasant smell, but it also works wonderfully.</li>
            <li>It glides on smoothly, has a pleasant scent and doesn&#x27;t feel at all greasy.</li>
            <li>Strong flower like fragrances give me migraines, so I loved the smell of this lotion.</li>
            <li>It has hemp seed in it, which is supposed to be awesome for the skin so very well pleased.</li>
            <li>She gets an awesome sexy tan fast with this lotion.</li>
            <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 is because the smell isn&#x27;t the best, but it works really good</li>
            <li>Smell is pleasant and light.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used a ton of tanning lotions, but this one seems to get my skin a great bronze color, and quickly.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it for people who don&#x27;t like a strong smelling tanning lotion but good results for indoor tanning.</li>
            <li>It has a good consistency and applies easily and evenly.</li>
            <li>It was such a good deal for an awesome product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fair skinned and do not tan easily.  </li>
            <li>smells good, and it really does work, great bronzing tanning lotion.</li>
            <li>I am olive complected and tan very easily</li>
            <li>and I tan very easily.</li>
            <li>I tan very easily</li>

            <li>This Tanning Lotion Was Pretty Good!</li>
            <li>great and perfectly priced u get more than ur money worth thanks amazon</li>
            <li>I have been a serious tanner for years now and always look for the best products with the best outcomes.</li>
            <li>This lotion smells really good before and after tanning, and leaves your skin extremely smooth.  </li>
            <li>I used this mostly outdoors, but my tan was sooooo amazing</li>
            <li>Lotion smells good, I didn&#x27;t leave smelling like I had just tanned which is truly important to me.  </li>
            <li>I have to say that JWOWW is by far the best indoor product I&#x27;ve EVER used!</li>
            <li>This is by far THE BEST tanning lotion I have ever used.</li>
            <li>that is BY FAR the best lotion i have ever used!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s nice being able to order them here.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy the smell, and it still smells good even after tanning.</li>
            <li>This product smells amazing, unlike most tanning lotions.</li>
            <li>This is BY FAR the BEST tanning lotion I have EVER used!</li>
            <li>Best bronzing lotion I&#x27;ve used so far.  </li>
            <li>I have been indoor tanning for about 4 years now, and this is by far the best product I have EVER used!!</li>
            <li>But, JWOWW makes it even more amazing.</li>
            <li>but I wouldn&#x27;t go as far to say it&#x27;s the best I have ever used.</li>
            <li>tingle sothis is a good fit for me.</li>
            <li>By far the best tanning lotion that I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the best lotion I have ever purchased!</li>
            <li>Love this product, makes my skin nice and soft while giving me an awesome tan.</li>
            <li>so i wanted to make sure I got a popular product because I knew if everyone else is using it</li>
            <li>but so far I am impressed with this lotion and the JWOWW tanning line.  </li>
            <li>Jwow products are lot more effective then the Snookie products</li>
            <li>Nice bronzer but not too much that you look orange!!!!</li>
            <li>I was noticeably darker right after tanning and of course for the rest of the day I kept looking in the mirror as I was getting darker, lol.</li>
            <li>Not too strong!</li>
            <li>I love, love, love it!</li>
            <li>I have very fair skin; however, when I want to get a decent tan going for the summer, all I need to do is use this lotion and tan one or two times before I already begin to get some color.</li>
            <li>It tans me fast and it smells good too!</li>
            <li>It helps you achieve a nice deep tan that looks GREAT!!</li>
            <li>it makes your skin even more soft and smells wonderful!</li>
            <li>This stuff is pretty darn great</li>
            <li>Great if you want be tan fast and stay tan!</li>
            <li>Not so hot on the body but a great tanner.  </li>
            <li>i am loving the color it gives me, nice golden brown!</li>
            <li>I had a pretty good color before using the product, and its even better after tanning!</li>
            <li>After hearing about how great this lotion is from my tanning consultant, I paid a pretty penny for it.</li>
            <li>The smell was not bad, but it wasnt good either</li>
            <li>True it does smell good, but it wears off after you get out of the tanning bed.</li>
            <li>I thought the price was too good to be true.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s too good to be true, it probably is.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very light skinned with just one use</li>
            <li>Very light smell almost a powdery sent.</li>
            <li>The smell is amazing and the first use of it came with good results</li>
            <li>It spreads evenly and easily and smells nice too.  </li>
            <li>good smell, worked quickly.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s good if you wana get a tan very fast!</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a good first time bronzer, this is it!</li>
            <li>I could tell a huge difference as soon as I stepped out of the bed!</li>
            <li>smells ok</li>
            <li>This was ok</li>
            <li>and i like it better.</li>
            <li>but i&#x27;m so glad I decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>Used better lotion, but will work for now</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>and it works better.</li>
            <li>Give it a try :)</li>
            <li>safe to use on your face as well.</li>
            <li>but I decided to give Jwoww a try after hearing so many recommendations from the girls at the tanning salon.</li>
            <li>The smell is probably what I dislike the most about this lotion.</li>
            <li>The scent is okay .</li>
            <li>ok...</li>
            <li>I am glad I switched.</li>
            <li>But with this jwoww tanning lotion I have achieved the look I always wanted and feel confident with myself.</li>
            <li>I give it time to finish working its magic.  </li>
            <li>I love this lotion because it makes you look darker after just one use but does not turn you orange at all.</li>
            <li>It was okay.</li>
            <li>I imagine the JWOWW 50x bronzer would work better..</li>
            <li>i love this item.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS TANNING LOTION</li>
            <li>I got it in the mail and the packaging was great and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>and I figured I&#x27;d try it one more time.</li>
            <li>but was tanning more for a trip</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m also not in love with the way it goes on.</li>
            <li>the texture was not as creamy as i was hoping for, it was almost more goopy and it didnt sink in at all.</li>
            <li>so i got a much better tan</li>
            <li>I really love it though.</li>
            <li>the thing i like about it the most, the smell.  </li>
            <li>like i just went tanning (and most lotions make you stink</li>
            <li>And I also love how this lotion smells...</li>
            <li>Better than it a lot of the tanning lotions I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>Although I did love the tan I got, I wont be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li>Would buy again :)</li>
            <li>I think the most I have used it is twice in one week because it lasts for quite a while.  </li>
            <li>LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>This product is ok....</li>
            <li>So I have tried alot of different lotions over the years, and have yet to be impressed.</li>
            <li>everyone was impressed, especially me!</li>
            <li>Many rave about the smell</li>

            <li>Again smells so much better then</li>
            <li>IVE HAD BETTER.</li>
            <li>There are a million lotions in this price range that work and smell much better.</li>
            <li>this is the closest to heaven that I&#x27;ve ever been and trust me you will fall in love with the scent</li>
            <li>love this product</li>
            <li>(Silicones make tanning lotions REALLY moisturize and keeps your skin looking great)  </li>
            <li>-I didn&#x27;t feel like I was getting exceptionally more tan after using it, HOWEVER, my skin looked and felt better and much more healthy/moisturized.  </li>
            <li>Price is way better than from the tanning salon for sure.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion.</li>
            <li>Read all the reviews, and was sold by what so many people wrote..</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found my favorite lotion</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s march 2011, and i&#x27;ve only tanned for three days and have a great result, even using the lowest power bed!</li>
            <li>I have tried serveral this year and this is my favorite one.</li>
            <li>This is great to use and so much more economic than buying at the salon.  </li>
            <li>and it seems to work better than Jwoww.</li>
            <li>and I have tanned before with some different lotion, and I am really, really impressed with \\&quot;Jwoww\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>its a good product and worth the price.</li>
            <li>REALLY GLAD</li>
            <li>I love my designer skin products</li>
            <li>Thought it would work better</li>
            <li>Not crazy about the after smell, but I haven&#x27;t found a tanning lotion yet that made you smell good after tanning.  </li>
            <li>you shower though, most of the bronzer washes off.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m about to try this one with the 50x bronzer and see if it does more for my color.</li>
            <li>Love it, love it, love it....</li>
            <li>I have been using Jwoww for a week, and I&#x27;m already way more tan than I was.  </li>
            <li>I was impressed that it arrived sooner than the actual date posted</li>
            <li>Instantly my favorite tanning lotion.</li>
            <li>I love it :)</li>
            <li>I am more of a designer skin gal all the way.</li>
            <li>I would order again! :)</li>
            <li>that most bronzers leave.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an okay product, wish it wold make me bronzer quicker.  </li>
            <li>I have used $10 bottles of lotion that work better than this.  </li>
            <li>that&#x27;s OK by me since the product does work.</li>
            <li>and I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>i love how it helps my tan and</li>
            <li>I love the smell</li>
            <li>I love this lotion.</li>
            <li>I use a paper towel to put the lotion on the top of my hands)</li>
            <li>Ok?</li>
            <li>but glad I did</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been able to find lotions that I can stick with for awhile.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this lotion.</li>
            <li>There are much better tanning lotions that work out there.</li>
            <li>and the smell could be better.</li>
            <li>This lotion is okay.</li>
            <li>The smell is just okay, nothing to brag about.</li>
            <li>I used it mostly laying out in the sun</li>
            <li>I have used this product many times  </li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>It smells great, has the perfect amount of bronzer and doesn&#x27;t leave that thick lotion feeling.</li>
            <li>Love this product - gives me a darker, richer looking tan........</li>
            <li>love this store...</li>
            <li>I am 22 and can tell you that I&#x27;ve gone through many lotions.</li>
            <li>absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>Definitely the best tanning lotion.</li>
            <li>Will be ordering more soon</li>
            <li>This is my favorite lotion and trust me I have tried a lot of tanning lotions.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>It smells so fruity and unliike most tanning lotions.</li>
            <li>and did what i needed :)</li>
            <li>I also love the smell.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t buy this from the tanning salon though since it&#x27;s about $30 more from the salons.</li>
            <li>Suntan City wanted to charge me $80 for a bottle, but this was a much better deal.</li>
            <li>Love this tanning loation.</li>
            <li>I even got a free sample for another lotion &amp; a coupon!</li>
            <li>This is my favorite tanning bronzer that I have tried.  </li>
            <li>The smell out of the bottle is ok</li>
            <li>but i had noticed most people who reviewed this had said it was watery or expired.</li>
            <li>After using almost the full bottle of this I can say I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>she LOVES the smell of this stuff on her much more than some of the ones she has tried.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the smell.</li>
            <li>I have had SO many compliments on my color and everyone thinks I have been on vacation.  </li>
            <li>LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li>It was just an OK tan....</li>
            <li>However, I would not recommend paying more for this lotion (as in a salon).</li>
            <li>Who doesn&#x27;t love a summery bronze look??</li>
            <li>Love this bronzer.</li>
            <li>Now everybody flatter my cinnamon sexy skin color.</li>
            <li>I cannot wait to use it :)</li>
            <li>I have the darkest tan I have had in MANY years</li>
            <li>Texture is nice, is light and moisturing.</li>
            <li>I love Jwoww tanning lotion</li>
            <li>but over all we were satisfied with the results it gives for a starter</li>
            <li>I asked a question of knowing how to tell if the product is authentic or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Satisfied.</li>
            <li>I love it and would purchase again</li>
            <li>Smells okay then after u use it</li>
            <li>/&gt;Jwoww&#x27;s where it&#x27;s at :)</li>
            <li>So I went to my favorite online store AMAZON and searched for tanning lotions, and selected the \\&quot;most popular\\&quot; option to sort them.</li>
            <li>And like I said, I never write reviews for anything, but this product definitely deserved a great review!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be buying again! :)</li>
            <li>Just in time for Halloween :)</li>
            <li>and then this on top of it &amp; got some color.</li>
            <li>I used it 8 times or more.</li>
            <li>but for the price it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>It was better than ok.</li>
            <li>but it was ok.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used Bronzer lotion becuase I have seen so many orange people.</li>
            <li>Love it...</li>
            <li>I guess it&#x27;s back to my authentic tanning lotions at the salon!!!!</li>
            <li>Love this lotion.</li>
            <li>I bought it because it was from a reputable company.</li>
            <li>It works ok,</li>
            <li>It works OK.  </li>
            <li>and I Love JWOWW</li>
            <li>My favorite.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and the brown tint it leaves.</li>
            <li>the product works ok.</li>
            <li>I just prefer to use a lotion that has tingle in it when I go tanning, the tingle ones work so much better</li>
            <li>Frankly scarlet my favorite .</li>
            <li>b/c I love tingles.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed using it .</li>
            <li>Look forward to using more of jwow products</li>
            <li>I have more of an Olive skin tone</li>
            <li>Love this lotion, Use along with her tingle product.</li>
            <li>Love the lotion and no horrible after tan smell.  </li>
            <li>Love the product, got it in two days like stated....</li>
            <li>again love the product and will tell all my friends about your web-site.</li>
            <li>I love the smell.</li>
            <li>effect but mostly because of the self tanners..</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion.</li>
            <li>love the lotion.</li>
            <li>The top was off when I opened the package.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also used LIV and I think I like this product better.</li>
            <li>Much better than the Millenium lotion.  </li>
            <li>Make sure though</li>
            <li>love this product..doesnt stain your hands..</li>
            <li>But like I said, probably would be best for someone just starting out tanning!</li>
            <li>This smells great and it is much cheaper on Amazon than in the salons.</li>
            <li>The bronzers do not work well and what is there is more orange than tan.</li>
            <li>Product was more than 50% cheaper than the tanning salon.</li>
            <li>Love her product.</li>
            <li>and when i pay alot for lotion i really want great results.</li>
            <li>so this lotion was just ok to me and its not all its cracked up to be.</li>
            <li>Its more of a jell than a lotion, than I would prefer.</li>
            <li>I have always enjoyed jwoww products.</li>
            <li>ok.  </li>
            <li>But I love this product along with the sparkle lotion by jwoww for after tanning.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love how this lotion smells</li>
            <li>Love Jwoww her lotion made me darker with one use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been tanning for 7+ years now and love bronzers.  </li>
            <li>Smells delicious and it pushes you to the next level of tan.</li>
            <li>Love JWOWW&#x27;s products</li>
            <li>I came on Amazon to see if there might be a better option for me and</li>
            <li>Love this tanning lotion.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m very impressed.  </li>
            <li>And I have been enjoying using the lotion</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t my favorite made me breakout</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>I suppose if anyone knows about tanning lotion, it would be jwoww :)</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is OKAY.</li>
            <li>I do have more acne prone skin</li>
            <li>I been using this for a couple of weeks now out of all my lotions I recently bought this one seems to work the best.</li>
            <li>My husband and I both love this bronzer, use it every time we go tanning.</li>
            <li>I get more results from a 10 dollar tanner and Walmart.</li>
            <li>This product is nothing more than a bronzer.</li>
            <li>Love the fact I can get out the tanning bed and look darker than if I had used anything else.</li>
            <li>i could have gone with a cheaper lotion that did better</li>
            <li>I read all reviews, and wasn&#x27;t sure if this lotion is in fact for me....</li>
            <li>I love the smell.  </li>
            <li>A friend introduced me to this lotion, and I fell in love with it.  </li>
            <li>but most stink after tanning giving me a headache.</li>
            <li>It has an amazing smell and it rubs on so smoothly.</li>
            <li>Love this lotion.</li>
            <li>LOVE the smell.</li>
            <li>Smell is ok.  </li>
            <li>Love that there is no after smell.</li>
            <li>It worked really well and the smelt very nice.</li>
            <li>the smell is to die for and i notice a change on my first time using it!!!</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with the color I got from the very first tanning session.</li>
            <li>It has a nice smell, which is important, and seems to have pretty good</li>
            <li>but i got a full bottle for sure!</li>
            <li>very good lotion makes you dark and your skin feeling good.  </li>
            <li>Nice scent, not greasy feeling, and provides a nice color if used consistently.</li>
            <li>I am an &#x27;experienced&#x27; tanner and tan in the &#x27;high&#x27; level beds.  </li>
            <li>and honestly it&#x27;s nothing special.</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t take much and the color you get is amazing!</li>
            <li>used many different ones and this ones has no tingle and gives a nice glow and also has a great smell.</li>
            <li>It is true that the scent is amazing and even walking to my car after tanning I can smell it.</li>
            <li>and I am really getting a nice tan using the lotion!</li>
            <li>First off I have fair skin and freckles</li>
            <li>When I first got this I knew it would be good..</li>
            <li>but I purchased it from Amazon directly not another seller and and thoroughly happy with the product!</li>
            <li>And It Smelled Pretty Good.</li>
            <li>I gave this 3 stars because I loved it when I purchased it from the salon, which was over priced of course, so I bought it here at a much cheaper price!</li>
            <li>First thing I loved about this product was the smell, I find myself smelling my tanning lotion even when I&#x27;m not tanning (yes, I am a dork).  </li>
            <li>an it worked pretty good</li>
            <li>and she loved it, she put an SPF lotion on first</li>
            <li>I have pretty fair skin</li>
            <li>Made my tan come out pretty good.</li>
            <li>I guess I had higher hopes, as some of the reviewers absolutely loved it</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t have very many bronzers, which is a bit of a down side, but it smells absolutely fantastic and works great!</li>
            <li>This bronzer is a good bronzer but doesn&#x27;t make you super dark really quick like some reviews claim, but is a great product for a great price.</li>
            <li>and I was not disappointed whatsoever!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to use it again today!</li>
            <li>Definitely worth trying!!</li>
            <li>I love to tan, My skin isn&#x27;t easy to tan.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of the lotion and how easy it went on and stayed on during the summer days of lazing in the sun.</li>
            <li>It goes on easy and doesn&#x27;t stay on top.</li>
            <li>What I really love is that it doesn&#x27;t  smell to strongly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nothing super amazing that I would rave about to others</li>
            <li>I loved the color it produces - it&#x27;s beautiful - tan without looking insanely dark.</li>
            <li>Has a mild sweet scent to it and goes on very easy!  </li>
            <li>Each new line that comes out has something ever better!!</li>
            <li>For what I paid for it, it worked fine but definetly not one of the top Bronzer&#x27;s that I have used for indoor tanning</li>
            <li>Its such a better price than the ones in the salon and it is just as good as the $115 dollar ones!</li>
            <li>I loved the smell of it and it does work to a certain point..</li>
            <li>It smells great and the best part is that it&#x27;s not thick like other lotions I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Overall This Product Was Very Good</li>
            <li>Im a real blonde very fair..</li>
            <li>LOL I am very fair skinned and it normally takes a long time for me to develop a tan</li>
            <li>love that smooth lotion</li>
            <li>But, with an extender and frequent use, I think it would be great for almost everyone.</li>
            <li>But I do tan and once its developed it looks great.</li>
            <li>Purchased this bronzer about a month ago and am so far happy with it.  </li>
            <li>After reading many reviews online including a few &#x27;best tanning lotions&#x27; lists, JWOWW was up in the top 5 recommended lotions</li>
            <li>So I naturally get a great tan.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make me break out, which is probably the most important.</li>
            <li>Good &amp; fast tanning achieved.</li>
            <li>so I wouldn&#x27;t have to go tanning as much to mantain a gorgeous tan.</li>
            <li>It got me a nice golden start to my tanning.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking for a good tanning lotion that does what it says its going to do, I would high recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Gives you a good color and not too much bronzer if that is the look you are going for</li>
            <li>It helps to give me a nice golden brown color - not read or too dark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It smells really good and works really well.</li>
            <li>I think the scent is perfect and the consistency is better than the Designer Skin that I&#x27;ve used previously.  </li>
            <li>Its like a good berry smell, not too strong but very noticeable.</li>
            <li>I used this tanning lotion for the first time today and I am in love!</li>
            <li>I received it in July 2014 and was really excited to get it cheaper since it&#x27;s usually my favorite.</li>
            <li>Excited to tan more</li>
            <li>other lotions I used smelled nice when I put it on but after tanning I stunk!!!</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s not bad to the nose at all!</li>
            <li>No bad after tan scent like some lotions!</li>
            <li>Blends in easily.</li>
            <li>I tan farely easy without burning.  </li>
            <li>and I got a nice tan fast :)</li>
            <li>I got tan very quick with this lotion</li>
            <li>It gives you that bronze look very quickly and doesn&#x27;t make you orange.</li>
            <li>so i don&#x27;t burn easy to begin with</li>
            <li>Huge bottle applies smoothly and smells fantastic!</li>
            <li>I do tan easily but wanted something to intesify it.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t tan easily.  </li>
            <li>or if my skin just tans that easily.</li>
            <li>I tan easy</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin nice &amp; soft after I use it &amp; gives me a nice color.</li>
            <li>just a nice even natural looking tan that you can honestly see immediately after stepping out of the tanning salon.</li>
            <li>it doesnt say how strong the bronzer is on it</li>
            <li>and it wasn&#x27;t strong</li>
            <li>I love using this, I have pretty fair tan skin naturally and this product is amazing for me.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this lotion and not because it has JWoWW&#x27;s name on it, but because it is a good quality lotion.</li>
            <li>I love it and it has just the right smell!</li>
            <li>im loving it, thanks!</li>
            <li>Leave it on for a minimum of \\&quot;4-8 HOURS\\&quot;, if possible &amp; you will see the BEAUTIFUL \\&quot;BROWN\\&quot; color take over your skin.  </li>
            <li>It seemed pretty popular.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried my fair share of tanning lotions out there and try to give anything new a shot.  </li>
            <li>The JWOWW Black Bronzer is awesome!</li>
            <li>, it should work just fine.</li>
            <li>This is the best Black Bronzer ever.</li>
            <li>Thank you Allure Tanning Salons and Spa for your quick shipment in delivery!</li>
            <li>My skin is fair, I guess you could say, in the winter I am quite pale, but in summer I do tan nicely (I&#x27;m Sicilian)!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t streak, you&#x27;re never orange, and the smell is pleasantly neutral (a big plus for a guy, as so many lotions today have a floral \\&quot;feminine\\&quot;</li>
            <li>The lotion is amazing after 2 days in a regular tanning bed using this lotion I received so many compliments!</li>
            <li>your looking for a great lotion with an awesome scent that won&#x27;t leave you smelling like you&#x27;ve just walked out of a bar, go get Solid Black.</li>
            <li>But overall very pleased!</li>
            <li>Just be careful to rub it in very good after tanning</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a good lotion with a good scent and makes you very dark,  </li>
            <li>I have used many diffrent indoor tanning products but this one has given me that nice natural color I have been looking for.</li>
            <li>It makes me so tan, just using it one time makes a HUGE difference.  </li>
            <li>I am now a HUGE fan of damn JWOWW</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed a HUGE change in one session.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There was a HUGE color difference, &amp; scent difference between the two lotions.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I came home and looked on here and found it for so cheap.</li>
            <li>I changed up some of my lotions but kept coming back to this one because it worked great protecting my skin while giving the desired glow i wanted.  </li>
            <li>They told us they use this Bronzer religiously on the beach with great results.  </li>
            <li>Its light, so it doesnt feel sticky or caked on or anything.</li>
            <li>it says berry scent, but honestly i cant really smell that.</li>
            <li>I honestly wasn&#x27;t expecting that much from this lotion</li>
            <li>It makes my skin smooth</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>Not only does it smell great, but it doesn&#x27;t leave your skin slimy.</li>
            <li>I bought this last week after hearing lots of great reviews.</li>
            <li>and I won&#x27;t even use it for free let alone pay for it.</li>
            <li>Great product would definitely recommend and will buy again when I run out.</li>
            <li>Not only does it smell great (like berries)</li>
            <li>it goes on really smooth and feels silky</li>
            <li>, it goes on so smooth</li>
            <li>my guess is that they still want to move the product and that is why it is so cheap...</li>
            <li>Has a silky texture, so it goes on smooth and you dont have to use a lot.</li>
            <li>and I enjoy the smell</li>
            <li>I really enjoy using this line of tanning products.</li>
            <li>Not only does it smell great, you can use it as an outdoor tanning lotion as well.</li>
            <li>Also makes my skin feel incredibly smooth.</li>
            <li>if your looking for a light tan this is the product to go with.</li>
            <li>My fiance purchased this for me for my birthday recently; I had read a lot of reviews and it sounded great</li>
            <li>I am biracial but on the light side</li>
            <li>It feels so smooth on your skin also.  </li>
            <li>The consistency of this lotion is watery &amp; there is no \\&quot;berry\\&quot; smell, but a light perfume like smell.</li>
            <li>I have confirmed this with Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Im a light Latino...</li>
            <li>My mother-in-law can&#x27;t help but, to lose her cheap stuff</li>
            <li>It rubs in well into your skin and makes you feel smooth.</li>
            <li>It goes on silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>It is very moisturizing and smells nice.  </li>
            <li>plus, it leaves the skin smooth.</li>
            <li>The lotion is light and oily and leaves me smelling like beer.</li>
            <li>Great price especially compared to the salon price.</li>
            <li>See if that&#x27;s what you are looking for, and if you decide to buy online make sure to ONLY buy from sellers with good reputations.</li>
            <li>Works ok, not as good as I expected but ok.</li>
            <li>So far, so good.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>I first tried this lotion as a sample and fell in love right away!!</li>
            <li>No streaks and i was able to see results right away.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend it and i will be buying more of her product!</li>
            <li>it works great outside and leaves a rich tan color.</li>
            <li>I used this for the first time today and I am already noticing a difference!!</li>
            <li>I was amazed at how fast this made it to my front door!!!</li>
            <li>i just bought this lotion today and iam so much darker!!!</li>
            <li>I was fairly excited when I found this product for so cheap on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Then I was just not tanning as quick and as easy as I had been.</li>
            <li>I have tried pretty much everything on the market just to say whats good and whats not.</li>
            <li>I loved how easy it was apply and it rub it smoothly and evenly without me having to constantly keep rubbing it in.  </li>
            <li>I do feel like I smell very strongly like the lotion after I&#x27;m finished, though, which I don&#x27;t really like.</li>
            <li>5 stars all the way , and be wise, and buy from amazon, unless you don&#x27;t mind paying $50 for it :O !</li>
            <li>My only reason for not being super excited about this product, is that my European Gold lotion from Walmart (about $8) just works better (it&#x27;s the best stuff I&#x27;ve ever tried, including the super pricey ones from my tanning salon).  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t smell AS good as I remembered but it still smells better than most and for what it&#x27;s actually for it does very well.</li>
            <li>-The scent is definitely NOT berry, though I find it is light, pleasant and non-threatening.</li>
            <li>The first time i used it I fell in love with them smell and wheni got out of the tanning bed</li>
            <li>totally worth the purchase!</li>
            <li>The bronzer I was using before, \\&quot;Smile!</li>
            <li>I was really excited to try Jwow, because i hear a lot about it.</li>
            <li>i was so excited to try jwoww seeing</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the seller I purchased from, but I was not too impressed with this lotion.  </li>
            <li>but well worth it!</li>
            <li>me tell you, this is some powerful stuff!  </li>
            <li>It was worth the wait to order it online!</li>
            <li>well worth the money!</li>
            <li>but I think it be okay for first time tanners</li>
            <li>It came with its original seal that even salons take off before selling.</li>
            <li>So I was superrrr excited to try Jwowws tanning lotion, come to find out</li>
            <li>I just tried this today after being so excited about it.  </li>
            <li>First, I love the way this stuff smells before and after tanning.</li>
            <li>This is the first tanning lotion I&#x27;ve ever tried and I really love it.</li>
            <li>As an avid tanned, I have used many lotions.</li>
            <li>I received it Friday and went tanning on Saturday morning was so excited to use.</li>
            <li>After going tanning just twice with this, I noticed a significant difference from the lotion I had purchased from the salon.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t thinki got original packaging.</li>
            <li>Okay so when i first ordered this product from amazon</li>
            <li>I was truly excited to purchase this lotion however after waiting for 4 weeks for this product it came unsealed, and busted up in the box.</li>
            <li>I am pretty sure</li>
            <li>Just what I ordered &amp; came really fast &amp; wrapped new, product is great, love this product, works amazing its a repurchase I have made several times</li>
            <li>I thought so much of this lotion that I decided to give it 5 stars easily!</li>
            <li>I tried this after reading a review, and just as the person stated, it smelled good and gave a nice dark tan!</li>
            <li>It is great and really creates a natural color</li>
            <li>Left my skin nice not yucky or needing more moisture.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really smell that smell at all, it smells more like a perfumed body lotion, and I actually enjoy the smell.</li>
            <li>Not only did it tan my naturally olive complexion perfectly, but it helped me get over my plateau.  </li>
            <li>I find that Designer Skin Black tanning lotion works better then this if you want to get great results fast. :)</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite!</li>
            <li>I bought this first because I loved the bottle and second because I had done some research and realized this was a top notch choice for tanning bed use.</li>
            <li>It gives great color, goes on smooth, and I didn&#x27;t break out from it like I have other ones.  </li>
            <li>This is a good lotion, but truly isn&#x27;t any better than other lotions in its price range.</li>
            <li>I went in one day and they were having a special on this J Woww tanning lotion.</li>
            <li>This lotion is nothing special.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed the product to a certain point.</li>
            <li>its nothing special.</li>
            <li>It does the job, but nothing too special</li>
            <li>Did not get burned, but nothing special.</li>
            <li>Nothing special.</li>
            <li>And the price is right!</li>
            <li>I started looking darker right away!</li>
            <li>i was super excited because i heard such good things about this product.</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t super strong, but it&#x27;s just right.</li>
            <li>Great color in minimal time.</li>
            <li>The lotion smells so good and the color after tanning looks pretty natural.</li>
            <li>I just recently used Jwoww&#x27;s lotion and I can say it was a pretty great lotion.</li>
            <li>We have only used it outdoors and the results have been been good.</li>
            <li>Of course I would never pay full price for anything there.</li>
            <li>To be honest, I didn&#x27;t even know who J Wow was when I bought it.  </li>
            <li>Recommend highly! :)</li>
            <li>I definitely got a good deal on it.</li>
            <li>Smells amazing, and really works for people with fair skin, without leaving you red, or funny colored from the bronzer in the lotion.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve had way better results; I don&#x27;t really see any darker results with this one.</li>
            <li>Sweet, but in no way floral.</li>
            <li>i have fair skin that doesn&#x27;t tan outside, and i must use the tanning bed.</li>
            <li>FULL PRICE AT TANNING SALON</li>
            <li>But i did get it in mail fast :)</li>
            <li>The guy at my local salon gave me a sample of the JWoww lotion to try and I loved it.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t so sure about this lotion, but I actually really like it.  </li>
            <li>well I have used it for about 5 mon now to really get the product used in many ways</li>
            <li>by the time you get out of the bed, you&#x27;re ready to get dressed and leave, no sweat, no grim.</li>
            <li>It coats evenly and smells good but smell doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d definitely recommend to anyone looking to have a gorgeous tan color.</li>
            <li>The golden lid will stay secure, so your lotion will not be compromised.</li>
            <li>Overall it is a good product.</li>
            <li>Throwing it out the second I receive my GOOD lotion in the mail.</li>
            <li>do it - just enough to soak into my skin and feel good.</li>
            <li>Overall, good product.</li>
            <li>I have a nice even natural looking tan.</li>
            <li>Good lotion, personally - I&#x27;m not a fan of the smell, but it isn&#x27;t a deal breaker.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a tanning lotion connoisseur, so this seems to be good enough for what I need, a tanning boost.</li>
            <li>the shipping is so fast i love not having to wait days on my product.</li>
            <li>The scent does block out that tanning smell (plus), but given that you smell like sickly sweet berries, I have to shower immediately after using it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Ive used this product before and absolutely loved the results only with one use.</li>
            <li>Designer Skin makes some really good ones that are relatively inexpensive as well.  </li>
            <li>Good smell, lasting color</li>
            <li>fair skin.i will definitely recommend this tanning lotion</li>
            <li>I would say if you are just starting it is good</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s still not bad at all.</li>
            <li>(It&#x27;s not a bad smell, I just don&#x27;t like it)</li>
            <li>It works great and the smell is amazing it leaves your skin soft and not sticky like other lotions would.</li>
            <li>I purchased it because it was the right price to get free shipping with my purchase of tanning goggles.</li>
            <li>(Do keep in mind, this was a $20 product, and that&#x27;s all I would ever spend on a lotion, but I&#x27;m sure the more expensive ones would be much better if you&#x27;re willing to pay, but this one is great for the price.)</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t produce that tingling, burning sensation that I&#x27;ve experienced with other lotions, depending on their brand.</li>
            <li>I bought this due to the rave of it and thought it will be great , without reading any reviews....</li>
            <li>Other than that it is great plus it&#x27;s wayyyyyyy cheaper on here than it is in the salons.</li>
            <li>It smells great and gives my skin a nice, natural dark tan that lasts.</li>
            <li>Also, the JWOWW bronzer was priced at $55 at the salon I go to, thanks to Amazon.com, I scored this great product at half the cost. : )</li>
            <li>Now on to the lotion: I am a loyal Designer Skin fan</li>
            <li>If I want to get tan quick, I use this lotion.  </li>
            <li>That being said, many promised that they smelled great and didn&#x27;t leave you smelling like that icky tanning bed smell.</li>
            <li>moisturizes adequately  </li>
            <li>-Dries quickly  </li>
            <li>but I notice it fades fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t find it is tanning me as quick as the reviews i read.</li>
            <li>I bought this tanning lotion about a month ago from Amazon.com, it came in the mail rather quick.</li>
            <li>I recieved my jwoww tanning lotion super quick...great communication from seller...</li>
            <li>It creates super-fast results with no orange tinting (insert joke here), goes on easily, doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or oily, and the scent is so pleasant and clean, I&#x27;m hoping a line of moisturizers is soon to follow.</li>
            <li>Product arrived quickly, and it was sealed.</li>
            <li>shipped quickly</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>I can safely say I will be buying more of this in the future.</li>
            <li>This one doesn&#x27;t plus it tans my skin quickly.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is also very nice   Nice natural dark tan ...</li>
            <li>THIS LOTION WAS RATED SO GREAT FOR MAKING YOU DARK.</li>
            <li>This is the very first time I have ever reviewed anything.</li>
            <li>It smells beautiful and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on the skin.</li>
            <li>Paying the extra $15 at the salon is more than worth it!!</li>
            <li>The smell seemed strong at first but it is amazing - no gross after tan smell.</li>
            <li>It goes on very silky and smooth, rubs in easily and very moisturising and non sticky!</li>
            <li>I only use high power beds or bronzing beds for great benefits of indoor tanning.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to anyone who wants a nice lotion.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THE SMELL AND GIVES YOU A NICE DARK TAN.</li>
            <li>Jwoww Black Bronzer is great for anyone who loves to tan.  </li>
            <li>Pretty good bronzer definitely helped me get the tan</li>
            <li>About the actual product, it&#x27;s pretty good.  </li>
            <li>It has a really nice smell, and has made me really dark brown:)</li>
            <li>I actually got a better tab from one of the samples packaged with it!</li>
            <li>It worked the first time i used it!</li>
            <li>and I saw a difference after the first session!</li>
            <li>I got it around the end of my first month of tanning, and was so excited.</li>
            <li>I really like this as well!!</li>
            <li>Came exactly as it was described!</li>
            <li>Today was my first day to tan!</li>
            <li>but this product made me so tan after the first use!</li>
            <li>You can tell a difference in the first use!</li>
            <li>After reading several reviews stating that I will love the scent, I couldn&#x27;t wait to pop off the cap and start smelling!</li>
            <li>It is much cheaper than the salon price!!</li>
            <li>My favorite tanning lotion by far!</li>
            <li>Thanks Jenny!!</li>
            <li>This lotion got me tan fast!!</li>
            <li>As far as the scent, it&#x27;s relatively mild compared to most.  </li>
            <li>I received this item quick, and used it right away.</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and is priced right.  </li>
            <li>It smells good, but that&#x27;s about the only positive thing I could think of.</li>
            <li>This Jwoww Black Bronzer is a very nice tanning lotion.  </li>
            <li>Also, I am very light skinned and after only one week I could tell a huge difference</li>
            <li>It did have a pleasant smell compared to other products ive used.</li>
            <li>I really like the fragrance and the smooth application.  </li>
            <li>My tanning lotion can fast and they even sent me free samples along with the bottle.</li>
            <li>The scent is very light(extremely important to me) and you don&#x27;t smell like a tanning bed after using it.  </li>
            <li>I was white as a ghost and started out with this (as I have before) and the results are truly amazing.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing and actually gives my tan a boost!</li>
            <li>Gives a nice overall bronze color..  </li>
            <li>Only used it 3 times and already have a nice tan.</li>
            <li>There are much better choices available for the same price.</li>
            <li>So basically this lotion is worth the buy.</li>
            <li>I have used countless lotions from over $100 to $10 lotion, and this one I would honestly say is in the bottom 10%.</li>
            <li>It was worth the cost.  </li>
            <li>Well first of all, I gave it 2 stars only because it smells pretty good.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.  </li>
            <li>SO DEFINITELY WORTH THE MONEY.</li>
            <li>This product is well worth</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so dark\\&quot; moments, but I did notice a really nice overall tan effect-</li>
            <li>I used it in a bed as well, but I love it in the natural sun too.</li>
            <li>I used it yesterday and today and so far I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite lotion.</li>
            <li>I paid about $20 for it, and consider it worth the money.</li>
            <li>Its by far my favorite and</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>As far as the lotion itself, it&#x27;s my favorite out of all the ones I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I think its worth it.</li>
            <li>I doubt this is what Jwoww really uses LoL because it is really not very bronzing.</li>
            <li>My favorite lotion so far.</li>
            <li>it smells somewhat the same but its not as effective at all</li>
            <li>Gives a nice deep tan when used in my tanning bed.</li>
            <li>It went on very smoothly and it smells really really good, and last a long time after your out of the tanning bed.</li>
            <li>It worked ok ( better than some other cheaper brands)</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Of course you need to stay consistent in tanning or it fads fairly quick.</li>
            <li>SUPER FAST DELIVERY!</li>
            <li>It smells pretty decent and you can tell a difference right after you go tan!!</li>
            <li>not as good as other jwow lotions ive used.</li>
            <li>I am rating tihs lower due to the fact that it just isnt that good of a deal for the cost.</li>
            <li>It went on thick, not expired that I could tell, and smelled good too!</li>
            <li>Yes, other reviews are right - smells good.</li>
            <li>and I went right through it.</li>
            <li>, right?</li>
            <li>It gets me tan right away.</li>
            <li>Worked well used it in a bronzing bed and it browned me right up</li>
            <li>I have used it 3 times and noticed a difference right away.</li>
            <li>This product was right on with what I needed.</li>
            <li>Goes right into the skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;something wasn&#x27;t right.</li>
            <li>I noticed it right away.</li>
            <li>I got the item before I was expecting it so this was shipped off right away</li>
            <li>I live in the south and the sun is incredibly strong here.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m the type that can sit outside and within 5 mins have a tan if its a nice hot day.</li>
            <li>I think the only good thing about this lotion is that it doesn&#x27;t make you super greasy like many other lotions do.</li>
            <li>It is very natural looking, doesn&#x27;t have a strong odor, goes on evenly, and moisturizes well.  </li>
            <li>I own a tanning bed and from my experience try the jwoww one and done advanced black bronzer..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a thinner lotion with a kind of weird light smell that kind of freshens after you tan</li>
            <li>The real product is much thicker and shows much better color much sooner.</li>
            <li>I have fair complexion and was worried that this may be too dark and be visible on my skin.  </li>
            <li>It gets you dark but doesn&#x27;t smell too good after tanning.</li>
            <li>The smell is nice and lasts for a long time.  </li>
            <li>This product really deepened my tan and quickly, too.</li>
            <li>This last year when I started my tanning sessions, I looked for a great bronzer, that wouldnt make me itch or turn me red as a lobster.</li>
            <li>It smells nice and is more of a thick type of lotion</li>
            <li>It gives results quickly and works very well</li>
            <li>I was expecting more color than I got when I used this, I tried it a few more times because I paid $40 for it</li>
            <li>special.. decent smell..</li>
            <li>It has a decent smell, not anything special.</li>
            <li>and it came very fast.</li>
            <li>i tan very fast anyways</li>
            <li>Works very fast to give you a darker tan</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping got it within a couple of days.</li>
            <li>but it is nowhere near what I have experienced with other lotions).  </li>
            <li>this lotion DOES give a good color, but it fades pretty quick :/  </li>
            <li>This lotion gave me a nice golden bronze color quicker than any other type of lotion I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>it was very light and non-greasy, i have been tanning for years, and it actually increased my tan (which is hard for me) plus the smell is great.</li>
            <li>First of all, The smell of this isn&#x27;t personally one that I like very much, but it&#x27;s not disgusting.</li>
            <li>The Amazon price is much cheaper than in-stores and it is SO worth it.</li>
            <li>I will purchase more items from this seller in the future.  </li>
            <li>This was my first bronzer besides tinglers.</li>
            <li>but I would def say it&#x27;s in my top ten.</li>
            <li>But other than that I enjoyed buying from this saler!</li>
            <li>This was my first bronzer</li>
            <li>The first couple times I used it, I did notice getting darker.</li>
            <li>I saw a difference the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>The first bottle I ordered through Amazon and will continue to order it through Amazon - there&#x27;s no point in paying $60-$75 for it at the salon, when I can save money ordering it through Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I will be buying this again very soon!</li>
            <li>I used this the first day of tanning this season, and in the one day, I have seen results.  </li>
            <li>overall I&#x27;m satisfied</li>
            <li>Much higher than that,</li>
            <li>I am an avid tanner.  </li>
            <li>I love the deep brown color it gives me.</li>
            <li>and if you look at the ingredients the Australian Gold has more ingredents</li>
            <li>EXACTLY</li>
            <li>at first when you get it on, but that is gone by the time you get out of the bed.</li>
            <li>When I first started using it in the tanning bed, I got a couple shades darker each time I went tanning.</li>
            <li>I used this product and noticed a difference within the first session.</li>
            <li>I used this lotion one time, my first time tanning in about a year.  </li>
            <li>Its soft and where I was breaking out from the cheap lotion my skin is clearing up</li>
            <li>i used it for the first time today ...</li>
            <li>The shipping was really fast also!</li>
            <li>Reasonable price!</li>
            <li>My advice is spend an extra $10 and get a way better tanning lotion or just go to a store and buy a $10 one.</li>
            <li>I ordered this lotion about 2 weeks ago and love the price I got it for especially since it sells in the tanning salon for $59!</li>
            <li>I could see a difference after the first use.</li>
            <li>And It Made Me Pretty Tan.</li>
            <li>And At A Reasonable Price!</li>
            <li>Thanks for making her smile.</li>
            <li>and itll have a funny smell....</li>
            <li>I really like this lotion!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve definitely had better tanning lotions.</li>
            <li>This is definitely one of the better lotions out there</li>
            <li>I DONT LIKE THIS LOTION AS MUCH AS THE JWOW ONE &amp; DONE!</li>
            <li>Would definitely recommend, the price is much better than what you&#x27;ll find in the salons</li>
            <li>I could tell the first time I used it that I had a lil bit of color to me.</li>
            <li>U really must try it!</li>
            <li>I thought I&#x27;d try this lotion since I see it in the salon at a much higher cost.  </li>
            <li>It definetely makes the tanning experience much faster!</li>
            <li>It was the first bottle I bought when I started tanning.  </li>
            <li>This is the exact product as the one in the tanning salons.</li>
            <li>When I first went I used a lotion my sister gave me</li>
            <li>;)  </li>
            <li>I will definitely purchase this lotion again :)</li>
            <li>and I have now gone twice, 7 mins the first day and 9</li>
            <li>but I saw results after my first session with this lotion.</li>
            <li>Im naturally medium light.</li>
            <li>My daughter &amp; I use it and it seems to work pretty well.</li>
            <li>I have been an avid tanner for about 7 years</li>
            <li>you get it SO much cheaper then in the tanning salon!</li>
            <li>Now that I have used some, it is not nearly as difficult.</li>
            <li>Very plesed!</li>
            <li>It is exactly what I ordered</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference in my skin color even after the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>I had immediate results and it looked even better the next day.</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s exactly what I got with this lotion.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s different for everyone.</li>
            <li>and this product does exactly what it is supposed to.</li>
            <li>Definitely a way better buy than paying $50 at salon.</li>
            <li>and I we have tried several lotions and this is one of the better ones.</li>
            <li>The first thing that made me suspicious was the lack of seal on the bottle.</li>
            <li>Love that I can buy this tanning lotion for my personal tanning bed.</li>
            <li>I will admit, the shipping was fast!</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>I use many different tanning lotions.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>I love it, only tanned for three days an use it</li>
            <li>It is ok for a temporary cover but rubs off the next day</li>
            <li>I know all of them have an after tan smell, but this one is pretty bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>isnt greasy afterwards, and i saw results after the first time using it</li>
            <li>First off the bottle is not sealed when you get it (like medicines are).</li>
            <li>this lotion made me darker after first use and it does smell yummy.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Allstar Tanning Products!</li>
            <li>The day after the first time I used it, I had three complete strangers remark about how fantastic my tan looked.</li>
            <li>I bought this same product at my tanning salon and it cost a lot more.  </li>
            <li>I actually think I get better color with the one that I ordered on line than the one I bought in the salon.  </li>
            <li>It smells good &amp; I have used it a few times.</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite tanning lotion, the price is right , it makes me so dark , leaves my skin feeling silky smooth, and doesn&#x27;t leave you smelling burned after you tan !</li>
            <li>I am a fair skinned girl who doesn&#x27;t tan that easily, but JWOWW has definitely helped me get dark.  </li>
            <li>Was here much sooner than expected, love this tanning lotion!</li>
            <li>I bought this lotion because there were a ton of positive reviews, but i was very disapointed!</li>
            <li>I have been able to only tan once a week and have amazing dark color.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t hurt that it smells nice too unlike other lotions.  </li>
            <li>I always purchase very good quality , tanning lotion , usually I buhy designer , long ago , I was always purchasing , Australian Gold &lt; or Swedish Beauty , now , I read the feedback  of this lotion , and I decided to give it a try , and I&#x27;m very happy , very dark,</li>
            <li>It is a definite buy is you are a serious tanner, looking for a great dark, beautiful even tan.</li>
            <li>and I am able to use it on my lunch hour since it doesn&#x27;t smell really perfumie especially since I work somewhere</li>
            <li>It is my favorite bronzer so far, and I have tanned since I was about 16 years old and have tried a lot of products.</li>
            <li>Much better price here as I have paid 4 times as much for this same bottle in salons.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this lotion twice - which is why I&#x27;m giving it four stars, not five; will update to 5 stars later if the results continue to be good -  </li>
            <li>I have tried my fair share of tanning lotions, from expensive (Designer Skin) to super cheap (some brand from Sally&#x27;s beauty store.)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been tanning for several years and although it is not my favorite lotion, it is pretty high up there.</li>
            <li>but thats all I can say thats positive.</li>
            <li>Smells decent, isn&#x27;t greasy, and soaks right into skin.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing and gets me so dark every time.</li>
            <li>It claims it has a great smell, it doesn&#x27;t smell any different than any other tanning lotion out there.</li>
            <li>First of all, I NEVER take the time to write reviews about products, but I felt I absolutely had to about this one.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t review on the &amp;#34;speed&amp;#34; of it since I tan pretty fast with just about any lotion I use.</li>
            <li>I received it pretty fast.</li>
            <li>When I tanned when I first got it, it really made a difference.</li>
            <li>but when the bronzer wares away there isnt much of a diffrence in my accual skin color and it was my first time tanning for the season</li>
            <li>I had use a small pack at the tanning salon and loved it...</li>
            <li>I usually use a tingle and decided to try JWOWW because I had heard good things about.  </li>
            <li>use it whenever I wanted a good rich tan especially a few workout.</li>
            <li>This one is not so much sweet, it just smells like old tanning lotion to me.</li>
            <li>I am fair skin and it usually take some time to see any color on me.</li>
            <li>It goes on nice and thick, it smells great, but I&#x27;m still pale as a ghost 2 months into tanning.</li>
            <li>Everbody has their own preferences when it comes to consistency, for me the light, easy to rub on texture was perfect as I hate the thick creamy ones.  </li>
            <li>;) a few other lotions i LOVED that had good lasting color were: designer skin belezza and designer skin queen!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pale but tan very easily and get a golden color</li>
            <li>I would recommend this lotion to anyone who is wanting a quick and natural looking tan.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been tanning for a good long time now, in tanning beds and outside.</li>
            <li>Once you&#x27;re at a certain darkness though it doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well.</li>
            <li>i would certainly buy again</li>
            <li>I get to a healthy looking tan (my pale self&#x27;s version of tan) with in 3-4 tans, and I don&#x27;t go full time</li>
            <li>Not as strong as I thought it would be, but it does give a natural tan look and it helps tan my legs which do not tan normally in natural sunlight or tanning beds.</li>
            <li>Got great color really fast!I&#x27;m very pale naturally and was so surprised how quickly I noticed a difference.</li>
            <li>I especially loved the amazon price, less than half of what the salon charges!   </li>
            <li>i have paid alot less for much better lotions with alot better results, just sayin, but hey its gonna be a big hit eigther</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, so most lotions tend to cause rashes but all of jwoww&#x27;s products do not do that and not to mention the rich dark tan I get from these lotions.</li>
            <li>The first couple of times I used it, I didn&#x27;t apply too much lotion, and still got decent amount of color.</li>
            <li>, JWOWW&#x27;s  Black Bronzer left me a very nice medium shade after about five uses.</li>
            <li>I am not greasy, but my skin does feel VERY soft!!</li>
            <li>Really excells your tanning prosses.  </li>
            <li>I really like this lotion</li>
            <li>I really like the smell</li>
            <li>Jenny&#x27;s smells light and doesn&#x27;t overpower but the that is second to the results.  </li>
            <li>I WOULD NEVER pay that much for tanning lotion and to think that was the clearance</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t see much if any difference.</li>
            <li>The lotion is on the liquidy side and doesnt have as much moisture to it.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a whole another topic.</li>
            <li>It was very itchy and it hurt.</li>
            <li>but i really dont want to put this stuff on my skin again either.</li>
            <li>and I really like the feel of it on my skin</li>
            <li>and after you tan, and lasts longer than the thicker tanning lotions that are out there, you dont have to use nearly as much.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll save so much money and mine</li>
            <li>Thanks amazon and JWOWW</li>
            <li>but I tan real well for some reason.</li>
            <li>I thought the price for this was reasonable and this package arrived in 2 business days.</li>
            <li>I found this cheaper version, and thought it was the real stuff, but i gotta say i don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the real jwow because it gave me orange streaks on my legs...</li>
            <li>this lotion doesn&#x27;t make me smell like burned skin when I am done tanning, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s very moisterizing.  </li>
            <li>I just have to moisterize really well after tanning, but I do that anyway, so</li>
            <li>and i used the whole bottle</li>
            <li>I have notice much quicker results using this lotion compared to others.</li>
            <li>thanks homies</li>
            <li>He tans much easier than I do.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>i will be totally ready for my outdoor wedding and looking tan.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all and really works as it should.</li>
            <li>Product came on time and was wrapped up extra secure.</li>
            <li>-Don&#x27;t expect it to bronze you overnight, as it doesn&#x27;t really do much of it.  </li>
            <li>-It has a somewhat unusual consistency.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s taken my 5 months to get really tan.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know if it would work that fast</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended and I will def buy again !</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s watery compared to the others I&#x27;ve used and didn&#x27;t really help me tan at all.</li>
            <li>Absolutely a joke dont buy this and save yourself the hives and rashes that comes with it.</li>
            <li>but this product works very well for me.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>REALLY</li>
            <li>The solution this is made from really works.</li>
            <li>After using it just once, (i didn&#x27;t even tan the whole time.</li>
            <li>But after a Month of Continuous use, I dont look much tanner.</li>
            <li>I really saw results.</li>
            <li>Really though, that happens with any bronzer lotion.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was fast too.  </li>
            <li>But didnt complain too much.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery, no problems.</li>
            <li>I was using another lotion that did absolutely nothing for me.</li>
            <li>Came fast a++±</li>
            <li>and I used almost the whole bottle.</li>
            <li>The lotion works very well</li>
            <li>The color appears as fast as it fades.</li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference when using this, wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li>Lotion is better than expected.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>the shipping was fast, the package was sealed, and there were not dents or dings.</li>
            <li>I had purchased another tanning lotion but just didn&#x27;t seem to really be getting any darker.</li>
            <li>This lotion worked really well for me.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this is the real deal.</li>
            <li>So I was nervous about purchasing lotion online because I know some people who have received baby lotion instead of the real stuff.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this is real indoor tanning lotion, used it in tanning bed and started itching and burned.</li>
            <li>I absolutely recommend.</li>
            <li>I really like the smell</li>
            <li>Thanks guys.</li>
            <li>fast shipping.</li>
            <li>but this lotion works very well .</li>
            <li>but I was expecting it to help me get much darker.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery,  no problems</li>
            <li>Very even tan, can&#x27;t wait to keep using this.&lt;br</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>I had used a much cheaper product than this and was much happier with the end results of it over this product.  </li>
            <li>really well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I tanned really fast</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very picky with my tanning lotions, but this one just worked SO well.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t really get the job done if you wanna get REALLY tan</li>
            <li>nobody wants that saggy skin.</li>
            <li>I really like the gold bottle</li>
            <li>Extremely fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t the real stuff .</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very berry scent, so unless you like smelling like berry bubble gum all day, don&#x27;t get this.</li>
            <li>I really think they just poured Jergens lotion into this bottle...</li>
            <li>I was really hesitant about buying tanning lotion online</li>
            <li>It got my tan really fast</li>
            <li>Shipping is fast.</li>
            <li>this one will take about the whole product to get about nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very inexpensive on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>So whats really in this bottle?</li>
            <li>I used it but really wanted one that gave me a darker tan.</li>
            <li>What she told me absolutely disgusts me.</li>
            <li>Basically, people who sell this stuff for cheap online aren&#x27;t actually selling you what you think they are.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>It works really well.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t see much of a difference.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m very upset with this product.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to get some color before we go to the beach in july</li>
            <li>But had fast shippimg</li>
            <li>Shipped fast.</li>
            <li>but if you are looking to get tan fast</li>
            <li>havent used this that much.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t even the real jwoww lotion ..</li>
            <li>I love creams that go on smooth, thick and creamy.</li>
            <li>Considering it is an Australian Gold lotion, however, it probably smells wonderful and would bring me a nostalgic feeling of Florida like most tanning lotions (I spent most of my teen years in Florida, and then moved away to my undying chagrin.)  </li>
            <li>I am a blonde hair blue eyed fair skinned 22 year old girl..</li>
            <li>It went on good and it was thick</li>
            <li>An authentic product may have been shipped at one point, but this one is certainly not.</li>
            <li>Produces a very rich golden color within a few tanning sessions.</li>
            <li>Jwoww is WOW!!!  </li>
            <li>Easy to figure out if you cut the package off and see that the bottle underneath is not the same as the normal jwoww bottle.</li>
            <li>, I had not tanned in awhile and it has helped me get tan more quickly than I usually do.</li>
            <li>It tan me very wellI was pleased with this product I would recommend this product to other people who want to tan thanks</li>
            <li>I have fair skin and with the other tanning lotions I would just turn red and that would be it.</li>
            <li>I have had problems with other lotions turning me orange if I used them more than one time in a row, but I don&#x27;t have that problem with the jwoww.</li>
            <li>It helps her get darker better than other products which she loves.</li>
            <li>I recently ordered this lotion and was so excited to get it and use it.</li>
            <li>This is the same exact product thats in the tanning salons for more than double the price.i tested it out by buying a sample of it at the place i tan</li>
            <li>Bday gift for the wife, she really love how it feels on her skin and says &amp;#34;no other tanning lotion can compare&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Mine isn&#x27;t watery at all and has the original signature on the back.</li>
            <li>Although I had to wait FOREVER for this to arrive because of a back ordering issue, I have to say that this product was worth the wait!  </li>
            <li>Within just 2 weeks, I have a better tan than I did with other tannings lotions in a month of tanning.  </li>
            <li>Smells great and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I expected more from this lotion considering the high reviews and publicity.</li>
            <li>It smells great and doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling all gross after my tan (well grosser than I usually do)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried this bronzer a few times and pretty satisfied with the result -  </li>
            <li>/&gt; Highly recommend got to me fast</li>
            <li>i had tried a packet of the jwow black bronzer at my local tanning salon, i loved the color it gave me</li>
            <li>One of the workers at the local salon told me to try out a packet of JWOWW&#x27;s Black Bronzer, and I LOVED IT!&lt;br</li>
            <li>it smells AMAZING and doesnt make u yellow or have a funny look at all it also doesnt make u really really dark</li>
            <li>They were incredibly dark and had healthy looking skin.  </li>
            <li>We always have a healthy dark tan.  </li>
            <li>Not only was it WAY cheaper on Amazon, but the reviews turned out to be true.</li>
            <li>Gets me dark every year :)</li>
            <li>It is definitely not worth $65 dollars, but for $20 I am pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>As an avid tanner, I have tried nearly every tanning lotion there is.  </li>
            <li>I was pretty surprised by that</li>
            <li>While it did make my skin pretty soft</li>
            <li>if you have a place that you love to go to and use this product, it will give you a really dark tan.</li>
            <li>and I tan pretty easily, but I already have a great base tan bc of this lotion</li>
            <li>I could care less about the name of the lotion, but I LOVE the fact that it works.  </li>
            <li>Now I use a tanning lotion from Sally&#x27;s, it&#x27;s less than $10 and works much better (quicker/darker results).    </li>
            <li>PAYING HALF PRICE IS MUCH BETTER THAN PAYING</li>
            <li>Just ordered designer skin black, hoping it works better than JWoww.</li>
            <li>It is misleading to label this lotion as a &#x27;black&#x27; bronzer since the color is more of a burnt orange after tanning.</li>
            <li>It took me a while to finally get a hold of JWoww&#x27;s lotion &amp; I&#x27;m so glad I finally did!</li>
            <li>I have tried many of the more expensive lotions and found this one to work just as well.  </li>
            <li>I have been able to keep moderate color by only tanning a couple times a week.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t look realistic.</li>
            <li>I mainly purchased this lotion because 1)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m usually pretty cheap and just go to walmart and get a $10 tanning lotion, but they never really worth.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s probably why I am not \\&quot;WOWW-ed\\&quot; with this particular one.</li>
            <li>The bronzer was the main reason I wanted the lotion being</li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll give you decent color</li>
            <li>The tan lasts well too, I maintain maybe 2-3 times a week, but can still keep a decent color if I have to drop to once a week on occassion.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tanned quite a few times using this lotion already.. and to be honest, not seeing nearly the amount of color I should be seeing.  </li>
            <li>and I will definitely be purchasing more JWOWW products in the future.</li>
            <li>The absolute highlight was taking my shirt off at a doctor&#x27;s office and hearing a nurse say \\&quot;Wow!</li>
            <li>On top of that, the lotion consistency was a lot like Sinfully Black in that it was more liquid than most lotions, but not in a bad way, more like it spreads further because of its viscosity.  </li>
            <li>Pretty pricey when purchased at a tanning salon, and doesn&#x27;t fit the definition of a \\&quot;black bronzer\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommend it.</li>
            <li>I had immediate color after using this with a high pressure tanning bed.  </li>
            <li>I recommend it highly to everyone.  </li>
            <li>They price this one like it was a high quality brand.</li>
            <li>I realize they&#x27;ve got to make money - but that&#x27;s almost high way robbery.....</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly Recomended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this tanning lotion.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this lotion.</li>
            <li>We would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not too sure of what this tanning lotion does other than make my skin soft and bronze me for about a day...</li>
            <li>It takes my tan to the next level, and even my boyfriend noticed my darker color after the first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend !</li>
            <li>Ok SO here&#x27;s a little lesson for all of you-</li>
            <li>and i was completely brown!!</li>
            <li>Left my skin really soft..  Loved the smell as well but didn&#x27;t get me very dark at all...  </li>
            <li>This lotion is far better than the most expensive products.</li>
            <li>As far as the product, it works really well.  </li>
            <li>I was skeptical at first to buy tanning lotion at such a cheap price on Amazon but this stuff works amazing.</li>
            <li>It makes your skin soft and it tans really well.</li>
            <li>I expected it to be cheap looking and used</li>
            <li>Great smell and doesn&#x27;t leave any streaks or weird coloring.</li>
            <li>I have used almost the whole bottle and have developed no tan from it.</li>
            <li>and it sure didnt last long.</li>
            <li>I can put it on real quick and not worry about missing a spot.  </li>
            <li>, I only need to tan once a week maybe two times to keep a nice dark tan.</li>
            <li>It gave me a deep dark color after the first use and gets better every time.</li>
            <li>Golden bronze brown all perfectly mixed.</li>
            <li>It feels like normal lotion</li>
            <li>My Tan Is A Mix Between Like a Red Tint And A Golden Bronze.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t tan everyday &amp; can&#x27;t seem to get to the tanning bed most days</li>
            <li>The lotion smells nice (to me at least, I&#x27;ve had comments from others that say otherwise).</li>
            <li>I am pretty sure its because my tanning place sucks.</li>
            <li>this lotion is kind thick.</li>
            <li>bought it once for $50+ at tanning salon, then found it here for half the price, cant get enough of it, no tingling or burning, no greasy feel, smells AMAZING before</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll wait until the bottle is gone to decide if the \\&quot;black bronzer\\&quot; is worth it or not, but for now, I&#x27;m going to say it&#x27;s totally worth</li>
            <li>right after or 48 hrs later</li>
            <li>I can tell because I am obviously tanner right after applying it.</li>
            <li>only on the right side of my neck.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is ok for the price, but I am not sure I would purchase this particular product again.  </li>
            <li>or I&#x27;m just impatient but it doesn&#x27;t seem to have any significant effect on increasing my tan any more than any other product that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>&quot; it&#x27;s a salon where we live...</li>
            <li>this is my new standby bronzer lotion.</li>
            <li>About 6 tans in to my new tanning salon</li>
            <li>but it was new and after I compared it to the ones in the tanning place</li>
            <li>Tanning New Paint</li>
            <li>so I looked for something new and found this</li>
            <li>I tan using the new euro beds (new to me).</li>
            <li>But if your a new beginner in tanning don&#x27;t not use a tingle lotion it will burn the hell out of you.</li>
            <li>I did not think about this until it started to happen to me, so I think I&#x27;m going to have to get a new lotion.</li>
            <li>I like to try new tanning lotions</li>
            <li>And after reading the reviews (some good some bad) about the smell, let me tell you the smell is light and airy.</li>
            <li>The only thing was that I would have some color after tanning, then wake up the next morning and be light again.</li>
            <li>because it&#x27;s so thin, it kind of soaks into the skin too fast.</li>
            <li>The bronzer does not last more than 1 shower afterl that&#x27;s not really the way bronzer should work.</li>
            <li>first and foremost the salon tries to sell me this exact bottle for $85 dollars.</li>
            <li>I expected a much better product from Australian gold.</li>
            <li>I want to first start off by saying I tan easily and hardly ever burn.</li>
            <li>GREAT product if you&#x27;re a person not looking for a super duper deep dark tan, and are just looking for a nice base tan.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend this lotion to all tanners, beginner to professional.</li>
            <li>Very surprised with the results.</li>
            <li>, i was a very natural tan color.</li>
            <li>The only downside is the opening, it&#x27;s kind of hard to get the lotion out after I&#x27;ve already started getting ready</li>
            <li>I order this product and after having to anxiously wait for 2 1/2 weeks to arrive, I am glad I order it.</li>
            <li>This was my first \\&quot;Australian</li>
            <li>I have never seen my skin so smooth and dark.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t get over how I went from pasty white to a couple shades higher in just 2 tanning sessions.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t decide to buy it directly from the tanning salon!</li>
            <li>I first used this in my tanning salon (the sample size) and I instantly noticed how tan I got!</li>
            <li>and I needed something to give me some color, after only laying 13 mins (didnt wanna fry myself first run)</li>
            <li>and I got my money back, because my friend that owns a tanning salon said that this is Jwows first ever tanning lotion..</li>
            <li>The smell is pretty gross!</li>
            <li>I will definitely be trying the other JWOWW lotions because this is my favorite lotion i&#x27;ve used ever.</li>
            <li>Ultimately, what you are paying for is the name and a pretty perfume scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the exact same as you&#x27;d buy at the salon.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin so soft!</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>and it was the same exact thing.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll definitely see a difference the first time you use it.</li>
            <li>I still see a difference for sure from other bottles of same Jwoww product I purchased elsewhere.</li>
            <li>I usually never tan</li>
            <li>She grabbed a bottle of the same exact JWOW tanning lotion off of their shelf, &amp; squeezed out some of the lotion onto her finger, &amp; then some of my lotion onto another finger .</li>
            <li>do not waste your money!</li>
            <li>Have had great results out of the Australian Gold Jwoww Black Bronzer Dark Tanning Lotion.</li>
            <li>I really thought this woud be a great lotion, but I was very wrong.</li>
            <li>For a get quick tanning lotion, Id go with Swedish Beauty Pink Diamond.</li>
            <li>After using jwoww lotion only twice, my skin is soft and moisturized and it has really boosted the tan I already had!</li>
            <li>I love dark lasting bronzers so as soon as I finish this bottle</li>
            <li>The only thing I can say that is kind of sketchy about the product is it did not come sealed or plastic wrapped, not sure if the ones at the salon are or not.</li>
            <li>The back of my lotion where JWOW&#x27;s signature is her name in full cursive.</li>
            <li>Compared with other bronzing lotions I&#x27;ve used, this does nothing special.</li>
            <li>Not as good as little black bronzer</li>
            <li>I bought this product when I bought my other JWOWW lotion in the pink bottle and figured it would be just as amazing, but unfortunately it was not as good.</li>
            <li>I sampled this product at my local salon and found that after tanning my skin was so soft and my color was more natural after tanning than it had been with other products.  </li>
            <li>very light abd its hard for me to tan</li>
            <li>i would just be a lil mad if I paid $59 for it from my tanning salon because after taking a shower your color fades just a lil bit because it doesn&#x27;t have a lasting bronzer in it, other then that its very smooth and doesn&#x27;t leave you streaky or sticky and the smell is great even after tanning your skin</li>
            <li>and it smells nice, just not spectacular!</li>
            <li>A nice thick lotion too, and a lot cheaper than at the salon!</li>
            <li>I love this, i recently bought it from the tanning salon but will be ordering through amazon because its half the price.</li>
            <li>i saw better results from the australian gold sinfully black.</li>
            <li>they aren&#x27;t quite as expensive as black, but are still great!</li>
            <li>I have several tanning products, but the Jwoww Black Bronzer is my most used product.</li>
            <li>just enough making my naturally dry skin silky smooth.  </li>
            <li>My most recent lotion was Black Noir</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had better luck with this than the solid black 100x bronzer.</li>
            <li>it was a very smooth lotion, not to thick and not sticky at all.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>a pretty pale person, so either this isn&#x27;t the right product for my skin</li>
            <li>Product is cheap to buy on amazon, but still not worth the money!</li>
            <li>BRONZERS SHOULD BE LEFT ON FOR A DECENT AMOUNT OF TIME!</li>
            <li>and I was only getting in one of those older style tanning beds!</li>
            <li>Maybe not pale but far from tan.</li>
            <li>I have to say its a great product I was referred to amazon drom the young lady at the tanning salon because I was unhappy with a product I purchased at the salon and</li>
            <li>One issue: the decorative clear lid will fall off.</li>
            <li>My 17yr old loves loves loves it</li>
            <li>But doesn&#x27;t offer the wow of tan that it claims too.</li>
            <li>Id say yes the feel is creamy and soft.</li>
            <li>It was very itchy and red.</li>
            <li>(It&#x27;s sort of an old woman smell.)</li>
            <li>Also, I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Its from Australian Gold and the whole \\&quot;Jersey Shore\\</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this to others, and I really hope the price stays under $23.  </li>
            <li>so it looks natural and</li>
            <li>I have been using this for nearly 2 weeks, and CAN NOT tell a difference.  </li>
            <li>It makes your skin really soft too.</li>
            <li>but this is my least favorite out of all of them.</li>
            <li>It is not for people just beginning to tan or people who have tanned frequently.</li>
            <li>I purchased this lotion here on Amazon on Friday and recieved it early this afternoon.</li>
            <li>Not heavy like someothers.</li>
            <li>I have been using \\&quot;Made for Love\\&quot; which I really like, but I just wanted something different...</li>
            <li>I have tanned twice with this and have definitely developed a darker color than I had before.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been to the salon 7 times this season so far.  </li>
            <li>I have been tanning on and off since I was 18 years old.</li>
            <li>It seems like the real deal, has the berry smell, and I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in my tan after only two days.</li>
            <li>Can also be used in natural sun.</li>
            <li>I got a natural looking tan.</li>
            <li>I like the bronzer, it offers moisture</li>
            <li>I have had the real one it is NOT MADE BY Australian Gold..</li>
            <li>Kept my skin soft.  </li>
            <li>if I get real UV rays outside..</li>
            <li>Instead of feeling soft and silky</li>
            <li>ive used almost the entire bottle &amp; i am really tan.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 23 yr old Latina</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft after using it and stays that way for hours.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t the same as the real thing.</li>
            <li>I forgot my lotion one day, being completely oblivious for 2 months that this lotion wasn&#x27;t doing anything, and had to buy a sample packet at the tanning bed.</li>
            <li>Save it and get the lotion at the beds because this product is a complete fraud.</li>
            <li>tan frequently, and wanted to try something now with a bronzer.</li>
            <li>I need color that looks natural and this is it.</li>
            <li>I get very noticeable tan lines on my shoulders when I mow the grass outside</li>
            <li>I went 4 times at 8 minutes,3 times at 10 minutes, and 1 time at 12 minutes so far.</li>
            <li>The lotion smells ok, not amazing.</li>
            <li>I am fair and have a difficult time tanning</li>
            <li>got the item right on time - was different packaging but it appears to be the same product.</li>
            <li>Jwoww&#x27;s Black Bronzer was my first really quality tanning lotion.  </li>
            <li>I find myself not having to go as often because it tans so dark, quickly.</li>
            <li>Now I would be super dark if I had not stopped tanning</li>
            <li>Gets you dark really quick.  </li>
            <li>I was also a little worried that the lotion might be frozen or burst open because I live in michigan, but it came perfectly fine.</li>
            <li>Gets you a nice light brown color but nothing too fancy and dark sadly.</li>
            <li>its getting me dark enough to counteract the no-tanning-bed-smell, huge plus.</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed about this lotion is that it smells and feels quite similar to a cheaper Designer Skin lotion I used to get at my local beauty supply.</li>
            <li>I am getting married in a month and need to get rid of my white white skin.</li>
            <li>I got a nice brown color and didn&#x27;t get any pink like I usually do.</li>
            <li>Overall a decent lotion</li>
            <li>Im not sure what to exect.why do i have to have ten more words?</li>
            <li>This lotion would be great for a first time tanner or someone that needs a base tan.</li>
            <li>When you exfoliate really well in the shower, your shade of color may tone down a lot more than you would think, and you&#x27;ll be a little more than surprised to see your dark color isn&#x27;t as dark as you truly thought.  </li>
            <li>it had made me so dark and the shimmer it gives is so pretty!</li>
            <li>you can tell a difference in one lay..gets ya dark fast and doesnt fade!!</li>
            <li>I had such high hopes for this product.</li>
            <li>they smell amazing, protect tattoos, yogurt base and full of antioxidants!</li>
            <li>I think most people who buy products off Amazon for $50 cheaper than normal don&#x27;t understand that you&#x27;re buying it either expired or its only half tanning lotion &amp; half normal lotion.</li>
            <li>I heard its so cheap because they only fill it half way</li>
            <li>and I went and used it wow it made me dark on top of my already dark tan.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money on more expensive products when i believe this product is better than them.</li>
            <li>At first I was really curious about this lotion and thought it was &amp;#34;one of those celebrity lotion</li>
            <li>once again, this may not work for pale people, or those who turn red easily, but for ppl with my tone of skin....</li>
            <li>Used it about three times and was super dark!</li>
            <li>I am a pale girl, and this is the only product I have used that actually works for me!! :)</li>
            <li>Winter is getting me down , so I decided to try Jwoww for fun.</li>
            <li>I burn fairly easily and it&#x27;s hard for me to get tan sometimes, but this lotion does the trick.  </li>
            <li>my skin tone is medium to dark, I get tan easily even outside, never turn red.  </li>
            <li>Goes on smooth, I&#x27;m not real happy with the smell</li>
            <li>My skin was still soft after using this product but it didnt get me my fast tan that the JWOWW in the Pink Bottle did.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll give it a few more tries until I call it quits with JWOWW.</li>
            <li>Being of Asian and Caucasian mixed decent, my skin is naturally tan.</li>
            <li>I should have known there was a reason for only paying a third of the real price...</li>
            <li>because you only get a third of the real product (if even that).</li>
            <li>The REAL bottle of lotion was dark &amp; smelled amazing, while my fake bottle I bought off Amazon was fairly light &amp; smelled slightly  like hand Sanitizer.</li>
            <li>Like this product a lot, doesn&#x27;t smell bad, smells pretty good actually.</li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t expecting to see any major contrast in color from the lotion alone.</li>
            <li>is major congestion...</li>
            <li>but I love this lotion, and I would reccomend it to people who already have a good base tan wanting to btw really dark.</li>
            <li>Definitely helped me achieve a dark look quickly.</li>
            <li>It smells great and didn&#x27;t leave a tingling feeling or any other weird feelings afterwards.</li>
            <li>On the Amazon items display photo, it is just a large pink \\&quot;J\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There are probably other lotions that would make you super dark in a shorter amount of time but this one is fairly decent.</li>
            <li>Definitely consider this JWOWW Black Bronzer if your looking for quick results.</li>
            <li>I highly recomment this lotion, smells awesome and doesn&#x27;t leave the nasty residue</li>
            <li>I tan pretty easily, but I have had lotions in the past that didn&#x27;t get me real dark and others that just turned me BROWN..</li>
            <li>doesnt smell too bad and works great.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and a little goes a long way!  </li>
            <li>It as if Australian Gold whipped together an old lotion and bottled it..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it 3 times thus far</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only got to use it once so far</li>
            <li>It is a tad sticky (just barely)</li>
            <li>item came in and is not the &amp;#34;real deal&amp;#34; Has a shrink wrap covering that isn&#x27;t even placed on bottle properly, and a total different label then the real one.</li>
            <li>I used this only once so far</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t get nearly the results as I did with JWOWW&#x27;s Australian Gold.</li>
            <li>, I have used the product in the past straight from the salon and it is the exact same thing!</li>
            <li>My legs are getting back to normal but its taken over 4 weeks of scrubbing and non use of this lotion for it to go back.</li>
            <li>The last two times I went, I used A LOT of lotion and noticed that I got SUPER dark!</li>
            <li>I love the Australian Gold Black Bronzer Dark Tanning Lotion.  </li>
            <li>I live in Canada, so that was probably why it took so long.</li>
            <li>I had ordered my JWOWW Black of Amazon (A-Z Wholesale Tanning Lotions to be exact) while using my Amazon Prime account.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical only because of the JWOWW endorsement, but after using it I know that I will by this again, and I have never bought a tanning lotion more than once!</li>
            <li>This really works well in an Extreme tanning bed..</li>
            <li>But in all seriousness, this lotion really does its job, gets you way darker than any other lotions I&#x27;ve tried, and</li>
            <li>Only problem now is I&#x27;m not extremely dark.</li>
            <li>definitely recommend this for fair skin as long as you are used to tanning and know how well or difficult it is for you to get color from the tanning bed.</li>
            <li>It smells nice, is a good consistency (not too thick, not too runny), and the after-tan smell is not as bad as with other lotions I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>I had been using a cheap lotion because I didn&#x27;t believe the hype that the expensive lotions really worked.  </li>
            <li>She said they used to sell it, and it was always a big hit with people who were already pretty dark.  </li>
            <li>and there is nothing dark about the bronzer, this is my first Australian gold product and I will be sticking to designer skin from now on</li>
            <li>It has a really great smell to it and isn&#x27;t too thick or too thin.</li>
            <li>Overall very satisfied, just still very confused on the different bottles!</li>
            <li>I used this for the first time tonight, and I swear some of my blotches from peeling are disappearing after letting the bronzers work for only an hour and a half before showering.  </li>
            <li>I got extremely dark extremely fast, but you have to remember with all the bronzers comes some downfalls.  </li>
            <li>I no longer use this product because of price, I refuse to pay so much for a lotion that delivers the same as other cheaper brands.</li>
            <li>While I&#x27;ve been tanning for several years now and have tried lotions from all the major brands, I&#x27;ve just started tanning for the season and this lotion had made me at least two full shades darker with each use, going only once a week.  </li>
            <li>OMG the bottle is super hard to squeeze out the lotion</li>
            <li>other reviewers said it didn&#x27;t leave that \\&quot;tanning bed smell\\&quot; and 2) I was looking for a lotion to help me get a dark tan quickly.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Although it is a little more in the salon, you will only need half of that product to go a long way.&lt;br /&gt;where</li>
            <li>I bought it due to the reviews that talked so highly of it.</li>
            <li>and it does not help you tan as well as other high end brand tanning lotion do.</li>
            <li>and it didnt get me that much darker, with forever black</li>
            <li>I actually  got half a bottle of Jergen&#x27;s lotion and half a bottle of cheap tanning lotion.</li>
            <li>It did keep my skin feeling soft after tanning instead of dry.</li>
            <li>when I leave salon my skin still feels soft and moisturized, not sticky and dry.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell nearly as well as i thought it would and believe it or not this lotion made me at least 2 shades LIGHTER from the first use.</li>
            <li>I usually tan really well naturally, but who has time out lay out for an hour every day?</li>
            <li>(I am super picky about this common slimy feeling bronzer&#x27;s sometimes tend to leave.)</li>
            <li>The side of my legs were super dark and then the inside of my thighs and shins were not as dark.</li>
            <li>smells good, doesn&#x27;t leave orange(y) brown streaks, and so much less expensive than the salon price.  </li>
            <li>Good item bad shipping</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the way it smells, my skin is crazy soft</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It gives you a nice bronze look and it smells nice too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Honestly i think they all stink after I tan.</li>
            <li> I got to be honest..</li>
            <li> This lotion is kind of watery?</li>
            <li> Nice smell, not greasy or sticky.  </li>
            <li> but I liked it.</li>
            <li> It smells nice, seems to speed up the tanning process, and has a bronzing effect.  </li>
            <li> &quot; kind of thing.</li>
            <li> but it for sure smells good.</li>
            <li> Brings out nice tone on my skin.</li>
            <li> I own my own tanning bed and have been tanning for years.</li>
            <li> It smells great, the bronzers turn you brown (not orange), and the end result is great color, and fast.</li>
            <li> (I wanna be honest )</li>
            <li> This really makes your tan look awesome.  </li>
            <li> I also am impressed with how fast it works.  </li>
            <li> Leaves skin with a nice tan color and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Smells good, too. :)</li>
            <li> The smell of the product is nice, so that was a plus.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Leaving you with a nice tanned glow, so I recommend testing it out with a sample from your salon.</li>
            <li> I am extremely fair skin, but am able to tan with time and consistency.</li>
            <li> I have always liked this brand</li>
            <li> The feel of the lotion is nice, silky and makes my skin feel hydrated.</li>
            <li> this one is just as good or better</li>
            <li> I really liked this product.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s as good or better than anything twice its price.</li>
            <li> I really liked this product.   </li>

            <li> Nicely packaged and lotion still sealed in plastic.</li>
            <li> I get a nice even tone faster</li>
            <li> i own a tanning bed, so i tan a lot.</li>
            <li> Smells nice, no orange spots, moisturizes.</li>
            <li> and I have a really nice tan.</li>
            <li> Nicely packaged.</li>

            <li> This lotion gives a nice bronze color.  </li>
            <li> Gives you a nice even tan and you do not burn up with heat in the tanning bed.</li>

            <li> It made my skin feel nice while tanning.</li>
            <li> This honestly wasn&#x27;t one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> I am looking for something to give me a nice pop of color and won&#x27;t be so stinky.&lt;br</li>
            <li> this one, even after I smell nice so I don&#x27;t have to hide at home until I take a shower.  </li>
            <li> does not cause streaking, smells good and will prob buy more after this is gone</li>
            <li> I love this new lotion, it smells great, the bronzer is amazing!!</li>
            <li> This tanning lotion gives you a beautiful bronze color quickly.</li>
            <li> Awesome :) exactly as I wanted.</li>
            <li> That was an important factor to me, as I am very fair complected and irritate easily.</li>
            <li> I use this in an upgrade bed which i used to burn in, and now using this lotion i can see very good results, very good price alot better than buying in the salon which is double the price.  </li>
            <li> Not only does it have a pleasant smell, but it also works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> It glides on smoothly, has a pleasant scent and doesn&#x27;t feel at all greasy.</li>
            <li> Strong flower like fragrances give me migraines, so I loved the smell of this lotion.</li>
            <li> It has hemp seed in it, which is supposed to be awesome for the skin so very well pleased.</li>
            <li> She gets an awesome sexy tan fast with this lotion.</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 is because the smell isn&#x27;t the best, but it works really good</li>
            <li> Smell is pleasant and light.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used a ton of tanning lotions, but this one seems to get my skin a great bronze color, and quickly.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it for people who don&#x27;t like a strong smelling tanning lotion but good results for indoor tanning.</li>
            <li> It has a good consistency and applies easily and evenly.</li>
            <li> It was such a good deal for an awesome product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fair skinned and do not tan easily.  </li>
            <li> smells good, and it really does work, great bronzing tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> I am olive complected and tan very easily</li>
            <li> and I tan very easily.</li>
            <li> I tan very easily</li>
            <li> Very strong , broke me out</li>
            <li> This Tanning Lotion Was Pretty Good!</li>
            <li> great and perfectly priced u get more than ur money worth thanks amazon</li>
            <li> I have been a serious tanner for years now and always look for the best products with the best outcomes.</li>
            <li> This lotion smells really good before and after tanning, and leaves your skin extremely smooth.  </li>
            <li> I used this mostly outdoors, but my tan was sooooo amazing</li>
            <li> Lotion smells good, I didn&#x27;t leave smelling like I had just tanned which is truly important to me.  </li>
            <li> I have to say that JWOWW is by far the best indoor product I&#x27;ve EVER used!</li>
            <li> This is by far THE BEST tanning lotion I have ever used.</li>
            <li> that is BY FAR the best lotion i have ever used!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s nice being able to order them here.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the smell, and it still smells good even after tanning.</li>
            <li> This product smells amazing, unlike most tanning lotions.</li>
            <li> This is BY FAR the BEST tanning lotion I have EVER used!</li>
            <li> Best bronzing lotion I&#x27;ve used so far.  </li>
            <li> I have been indoor tanning for about 4 years now, and this is by far the best product I have EVER used!!</li>
            <li> But, JWOWW makes it even more amazing.</li>
            <li> but I wouldn&#x27;t go as far to say it&#x27;s the best I have ever used.</li>
            <li> tingle sothis is a good fit for me.</li>
            <li> By far the best tanning lotion that I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> This is by far the best lotion I have ever purchased!</li>
            <li> Love this product, makes my skin nice and soft while giving me an awesome tan.</li>
            <li> so i wanted to make sure I got a popular product because I knew if everyone else is using it</li>
            <li> but so far I am impressed with this lotion and the JWOWW tanning line.  </li>
            <li> Jwow products are lot more effective then the Snookie products</li>
            <li> Nice bronzer but not too much that you look orange!!!!</li>
            <li> I was noticeably darker right after tanning and of course for the rest of the day I kept looking in the mirror as I was getting darker, lol.</li>
            <li> Not too strong!</li>
            <li> I love, love, love it!</li>
            <li> I have very fair skin; however, when I want to get a decent tan going for the summer, all I need to do is use this lotion and tan one or two times before I already begin to get some color.</li>
            <li> It tans me fast and it smells good too!</li>
            <li> It helps you achieve a nice deep tan that looks GREAT!!</li>
            <li> it makes your skin even more soft and smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> This stuff is pretty darn great</li>
            <li> Great if you want be tan fast and stay tan!</li>
            <li> Not so hot on the body but a great tanner.  </li>
            <li> i am loving the color it gives me, nice golden brown!</li>
            <li> I had a pretty good color before using the product, and its even better after tanning!</li>
            <li> After hearing about how great this lotion is from my tanning consultant, I paid a pretty penny for it.</li>
            <li> The smell was not bad, but it wasnt good either</li>
            <li> True it does smell good, but it wears off after you get out of the tanning bed.</li>
            <li> I thought the price was too good to be true.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s too good to be true, it probably is.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very light skinned with just one use</li>
            <li> Very light smell almost a powdery sent.</li>
            <li> The smell is amazing and the first use of it came with good results</li>
            <li> It spreads evenly and easily and smells nice too.  </li>
            <li> good smell, worked quickly.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good if you wana get a tan very fast!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a good first time bronzer, this is it!</li>
            <li> I could tell a huge difference as soon as I stepped out of the bed!</li>
            <li> smells ok</li>
            <li> This was ok</li>
            <li> and i like it better.</li>
            <li> but i&#x27;m so glad I decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> Used better lotion, but will work for now</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> and it works better.</li>
            <li> Give it a try :)</li>
            <li> safe to use on your face as well.</li>
            <li> but I decided to give Jwoww a try after hearing so many recommendations from the girls at the tanning salon.</li>
            <li> The smell is probably what I dislike the most about this lotion.</li>
            <li> The scent is okay .</li>
            <li> ok...</li>
            <li> I am glad I switched.</li>
            <li> But with this jwoww tanning lotion I have achieved the look I always wanted and feel confident with myself.</li>
            <li> I give it time to finish working its magic.  </li>
            <li> I love this lotion because it makes you look darker after just one use but does not turn you orange at all.</li>
            <li> It was okay.</li>
            <li> I imagine the JWOWW 50x bronzer would work better..</li>
            <li> i love this item.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS TANNING LOTION</li>
            <li> I got it in the mail and the packaging was great and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> and I figured I&#x27;d try it one more time.</li>
            <li> but was tanning more for a trip</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m also not in love with the way it goes on.</li>
            <li> the texture was not as creamy as i was hoping for, it was almost more goopy and it didnt sink in at all.</li>
            <li> so i got a much better tan</li>
            <li> I really love it though.</li>
            <li> the thing i like about it the most, the smell.  </li>
            <li> like i just went tanning (and most lotions make you stink</li>
            <li> And I also love how this lotion smells...</li>
            <li> Better than it a lot of the tanning lotions I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> I love this</li>
            <li> Although I did love the tan I got, I wont be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> Would buy again :)</li>
            <li> I think the most I have used it is twice in one week because it lasts for quite a while.  </li>
            <li> LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> This product is ok....</li>
            <li> So I have tried alot of different lotions over the years, and have yet to be impressed.</li>
            <li> everyone was impressed, especially me!</li>
            <li> Many rave about the smell</li>
            <li> its ok but</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> :) Enjoy!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion-</li>
            <li> don;t love it.</li>

            <li> I LOVE THIS LOTION, ITS</li>

            <li> &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been indoor tanning for many years</li>
            <li> I love this lotion.  </li>
            <li> and I love the smell.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to buy more.  </li>
            <li> i really love this</li>
            <li> I love this lotion.</li>
            <li> i love JWWOW.</li>
            <li> Again smells so much better then</li>
            <li> IVE HAD BETTER.</li>
            <li> There are a million lotions in this price range that work and smell much better.</li>
            <li> this is the closest to heaven that I&#x27;ve ever been and trust me you will fall in love with the scent</li>
            <li> love this product</li>
            <li> (Silicones make tanning lotions REALLY moisturize and keeps your skin looking great)  </li>
            <li> -I didn&#x27;t feel like I was getting exceptionally more tan after using it, HOWEVER, my skin looked and felt better and much more healthy/moisturized.  </li>
            <li> Price is way better than from the tanning salon for sure.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion.</li>
            <li> Read all the reviews, and was sold by what so many people wrote..</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found my favorite lotion</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s march 2011, and i&#x27;ve only tanned for three days and have a great result, even using the lowest power bed!</li>
            <li> I have tried serveral this year and this is my favorite one.</li>
            <li> This is great to use and so much more economic than buying at the salon.  </li>
            <li> and it seems to work better than Jwoww.</li>
            <li> and I have tanned before with some different lotion, and I am really, really impressed with \\&quot;Jwoww\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> its a good product and worth the price.</li>
            <li> REALLY GLAD</li>
            <li> I love my designer skin products</li>
            <li> Thought it would work better</li>
            <li> Not crazy about the after smell, but I haven&#x27;t found a tanning lotion yet that made you smell good after tanning.  </li>
            <li> you shower though, most of the bronzer washes off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m about to try this one with the 50x bronzer and see if it does more for my color.</li>
            <li> Love it, love it, love it....</li>
            <li> I have been using Jwoww for a week, and I&#x27;m already way more tan than I was.  </li>
            <li> I was impressed that it arrived sooner than the actual date posted</li>
            <li> Instantly my favorite tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> I love it :)</li>
            <li> I am more of a designer skin gal all the way.</li>
            <li> I would order again! :)</li>
            <li> that most bronzers leave.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an okay product, wish it wold make me bronzer quicker.  </li>
            <li> I have used $10 bottles of lotion that work better than this.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s OK by me since the product does work.</li>
            <li> and I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> i love how it helps my tan and</li>
            <li> I love the smell</li>
            <li> I love this lotion.</li>
            <li> I use a paper towel to put the lotion on the top of my hands)</li>
            <li> Ok?</li>
            <li> but glad I did</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been able to find lotions that I can stick with for awhile.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE this lotion.</li>
            <li> There are much better tanning lotions that work out there.</li>
            <li> and the smell could be better.</li>
            <li> This lotion is okay.</li>
            <li> The smell is just okay, nothing to brag about.</li>
            <li> I used it mostly laying out in the sun</li>
            <li> I have used this product many times  </li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> It smells great, has the perfect amount of bronzer and doesn&#x27;t leave that thick lotion feeling.</li>
            <li> Love this product - gives me a darker, richer looking tan........</li>
            <li> love this store...</li>
            <li> I am 22 and can tell you that I&#x27;ve gone through many lotions.</li>
            <li> absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> Definitely the best tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> Will be ordering more soon</li>
            <li> This is my favorite lotion and trust me I have tried a lot of tanning lotions.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> It smells so fruity and unliike most tanning lotions.</li>
            <li> and did what i needed :)</li>
            <li> I also love the smell.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy this from the tanning salon though since it&#x27;s about $30 more from the salons.</li>
            <li> Suntan City wanted to charge me $80 for a bottle, but this was a much better deal.</li>
            <li> Love this tanning loation.</li>
            <li> I even got a free sample for another lotion &amp; a coupon!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite tanning bronzer that I have tried.  </li>
            <li> The smell out of the bottle is ok</li>
            <li> but i had noticed most people who reviewed this had said it was watery or expired.</li>
            <li> After using almost the full bottle of this I can say I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> she LOVES the smell of this stuff on her much more than some of the ones she has tried.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the smell.</li>
            <li> I have had SO many compliments on my color and everyone thinks I have been on vacation.  </li>
            <li> LOVE this product.  </li>
            <li> It was just an OK tan....</li>
            <li> However, I would not recommend paying more for this lotion (as in a salon).</li>
            <li> Who doesn&#x27;t love a summery bronze look??</li>
            <li> Love this bronzer.</li>
            <li> Now everybody flatter my cinnamon sexy skin color.</li>
            <li> I cannot wait to use it :)</li>
            <li> I have the darkest tan I have had in MANY years</li>
            <li> Texture is nice, is light and moisturing.</li>
            <li> I love Jwoww tanning lotion</li>
            <li> but over all we were satisfied with the results it gives for a starter</li>
            <li> I asked a question of knowing how to tell if the product is authentic or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Satisfied.</li>
            <li> I love it and would purchase again</li>
            <li> Smells okay then after u use it</li>
            <li> /&gt;Jwoww&#x27;s where it&#x27;s at :)</li>
            <li> So I went to my favorite online store AMAZON and searched for tanning lotions, and selected the \\&quot;most popular\\&quot; option to sort them.</li>
            <li> And like I said, I never write reviews for anything, but this product definitely deserved a great review!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be buying again! :)</li>
            <li> Just in time for Halloween :)</li>
            <li> and then this on top of it &amp; got some color.</li>
            <li> I used it 8 times or more.</li>
            <li> but for the price it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> It was better than ok.</li>
            <li> but it was ok.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used Bronzer lotion becuase I have seen so many orange people.</li>
            <li> Love it...</li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s back to my authentic tanning lotions at the salon!!!!</li>
            <li> Love this lotion.</li>
            <li> I bought it because it was from a reputable company.</li>
            <li> It works ok,</li>

            <li> I love the smell and the brown tint it leaves.</li>
            <li> the product works ok.</li>
            <li> I just prefer to use a lotion that has tingle in it when I go tanning, the tingle ones work so much better</li>
            <li> Frankly scarlet my favorite .</li>
            <li> b/c I love tingles.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed using it .</li>
            <li> Look forward to using more of jwow products</li>
            <li> I have more of an Olive skin tone</li>
            <li> Love this lotion, Use along with her tingle product.</li>
            <li> Love the lotion and no horrible after tan smell.  </li>

            <li> again love the product and will tell all my friends about your web-site.</li>
            <li> I love the smell.</li>

            <li> The top was off when I opened the package.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also used LIV and I think I like this product better.</li>
            <li> Much better than the Millenium lotion.  </li>
            <li> Make sure though</li>
            <li> love this product..doesnt stain your hands..</li>
            <li> But like I said, probably would be best for someone just starting out tanning!</li>
            <li> This smells great and it is much cheaper on Amazon than in the salons.</li>
            <li> The bronzers do not work well and what is there is more orange than tan.</li>
            <li> Product was more than 50% cheaper than the tanning salon.</li>
            <li> Love her product.</li>
            <li> and when i pay alot for lotion i really want great results.</li>
            <li> so this lotion was just ok to me and its not all its cracked up to be.</li>
            <li> Its more of a jell than a lotion, than I would prefer.</li>
            <li> I have always enjoyed jwoww products.</li>
            <li> ok.  </li>
            <li> But I love this product along with the sparkle lotion by jwoww for after tanning.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love how this lotion smells</li>
            <li> Love Jwoww her lotion made me darker with one use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been tanning for 7+ years now and love bronzers.  </li>
            <li> Smells delicious and it pushes you to the next level of tan.</li>
            <li> Love JWOWW&#x27;s products</li>
            <li> I came on Amazon to see if there might be a better option for me and</li>
            <li> Love this tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m very impressed.  </li>
            <li> And I have been enjoying using the lotion</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t my favorite made me breakout</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I suppose if anyone knows about tanning lotion, it would be jwoww :)</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is OKAY.</li>
            <li> I do have more acne prone skin</li>
            <li> I been using this for a couple of weeks now out of all my lotions I recently bought this one seems to work the best.</li>
            <li> My husband and I both love this bronzer, use it every time we go tanning.</li>
            <li> I get more results from a 10 dollar tanner and Walmart.</li>
            <li> This product is nothing more than a bronzer.</li>
            <li> Love the fact I can get out the tanning bed and look darker than if I had used anything else.</li>
            <li> i could have gone with a cheaper lotion that did better</li>
            <li> I read all reviews, and wasn&#x27;t sure if this lotion is in fact for me....</li>
            <li> I love the smell.  </li>
            <li> A friend introduced me to this lotion, and I fell in love with it.  </li>
            <li> but most stink after tanning giving me a headache.</li>
            <li> It has an amazing smell and it rubs on so smoothly.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion.</li>
            <li> LOVE the smell.</li>
            <li> Smell is ok.  </li>
            <li> Love that there is no after smell.</li>
            <li> It worked really well and the smelt very nice.</li>
            <li> the smell is to die for and i notice a change on my first time using it!!!</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the color I got from the very first tanning session.</li>
            <li> It has a nice smell, which is important, and seems to have pretty good</li>
            <li> but i got a full bottle for sure!</li>
            <li> very good lotion makes you dark and your skin feeling good.  </li>
            <li> Nice scent, not greasy feeling, and provides a nice color if used consistently.</li>
            <li> I am an &#x27;experienced&#x27; tanner and tan in the &#x27;high&#x27; level beds.  </li>
            <li> and honestly it&#x27;s nothing special.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t take much and the color you get is amazing!</li>
            <li> used many different ones and this ones has no tingle and gives a nice glow and also has a great smell.</li>
            <li> It is true that the scent is amazing and even walking to my car after tanning I can smell it.</li>
            <li> and I am really getting a nice tan using the lotion!</li>
            <li> First off I have fair skin and freckles</li>
            <li> When I first got this I knew it would be good..</li>
            <li> but I purchased it from Amazon directly not another seller and and thoroughly happy with the product!</li>
            <li> And It Smelled Pretty Good.</li>
            <li> I gave this 3 stars because I loved it when I purchased it from the salon, which was over priced of course, so I bought it here at a much cheaper price!</li>
            <li> First thing I loved about this product was the smell, I find myself smelling my tanning lotion even when I&#x27;m not tanning (yes, I am a dork).  </li>
            <li> an it worked pretty good</li>
            <li> and she loved it, she put an SPF lotion on first</li>
            <li> I have pretty fair skin</li>
            <li> Made my tan come out pretty good.</li>
            <li> I guess I had higher hopes, as some of the reviewers absolutely loved it</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t have very many bronzers, which is a bit of a down side, but it smells absolutely fantastic and works great!</li>
            <li> This bronzer is a good bronzer but doesn&#x27;t make you super dark really quick like some reviews claim, but is a great product for a great price.</li>
            <li> and I was not disappointed whatsoever!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to use it again today!</li>
            <li> Definitely worth trying!!</li>
            <li> I love to tan, My skin isn&#x27;t easy to tan.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of the lotion and how easy it went on and stayed on during the summer days of lazing in the sun.</li>
            <li> It goes on easy and doesn&#x27;t stay on top.</li>
            <li> What I really love is that it doesn&#x27;t  smell to strongly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nothing super amazing that I would rave about to others</li>
            <li> I loved the color it produces - it&#x27;s beautiful - tan without looking insanely dark.</li>
            <li> Has a mild sweet scent to it and goes on very easy!  </li>
            <li> Each new line that comes out has something ever better!!</li>
            <li> For what I paid for it, it worked fine but definetly not one of the top Bronzer&#x27;s that I have used for indoor tanning</li>
            <li> Its such a better price than the ones in the salon and it is just as good as the $115 dollar ones!</li>
            <li> I loved the smell of it and it does work to a certain point..</li>
            <li> It smells great and the best part is that it&#x27;s not thick like other lotions I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Overall This Product Was Very Good</li>
            <li> Im a real blonde very fair..</li>
            <li> LOL I am very fair skinned and it normally takes a long time for me to develop a tan</li>
            <li> love that smooth lotion</li>
            <li> But, with an extender and frequent use, I think it would be great for almost everyone.</li>
            <li> But I do tan and once its developed it looks great.</li>
            <li> Purchased this bronzer about a month ago and am so far happy with it.  </li>
            <li> After reading many reviews online including a few &#x27;best tanning lotions&#x27; lists, JWOWW was up in the top 5 recommended lotions</li>
            <li> So I naturally get a great tan.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make me break out, which is probably the most important.</li>
            <li> Good &amp; fast tanning achieved.</li>
            <li> so I wouldn&#x27;t have to go tanning as much to mantain a gorgeous tan.</li>
            <li> It got me a nice golden start to my tanning.  </li>
            <li> If you are looking for a good tanning lotion that does what it says its going to do, I would high recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Gives you a good color and not too much bronzer if that is the look you are going for</li>
            <li> It helps to give me a nice golden brown color - not read or too dark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It smells really good and works really well.</li>
            <li> I think the scent is perfect and the consistency is better than the Designer Skin that I&#x27;ve used previously.  </li>
            <li> Its like a good berry smell, not too strong but very noticeable.</li>
            <li> I used this tanning lotion for the first time today and I am in love!</li>
            <li> I received it in July 2014 and was really excited to get it cheaper since it&#x27;s usually my favorite.</li>
            <li> Excited to tan more</li>
            <li> other lotions I used smelled nice when I put it on but after tanning I stunk!!!</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s not bad to the nose at all!</li>
            <li> No bad after tan scent like some lotions!</li>
            <li> Blends in easily.</li>
            <li> I tan farely easy without burning.  </li>
            <li> and I got a nice tan fast :)</li>
            <li> I got tan very quick with this lotion</li>
            <li> It gives you that bronze look very quickly and doesn&#x27;t make you orange.</li>
            <li> so i don&#x27;t burn easy to begin with</li>
            <li> Huge bottle applies smoothly and smells fantastic!</li>
            <li> I do tan easily but wanted something to intesify it.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t tan easily.  </li>
            <li> or if my skin just tans that easily.</li>
            <li> I tan easy</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin nice &amp; soft after I use it &amp; gives me a nice color.</li>
            <li> just a nice even natural looking tan that you can honestly see immediately after stepping out of the tanning salon.</li>
            <li> it doesnt say how strong the bronzer is on it</li>
            <li> and it wasn&#x27;t strong</li>
            <li> I love using this, I have pretty fair tan skin naturally and this product is amazing for me.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this lotion and not because it has JWoWW&#x27;s name on it, but because it is a good quality lotion.</li>
            <li> I love it and it has just the right smell!</li>
            <li> im loving it, thanks!</li>
            <li> Leave it on for a minimum of \\&quot;4-8 HOURS\\&quot;, if possible &amp; you will see the BEAUTIFUL \\&quot;BROWN\\&quot; color take over your skin.  </li>
            <li> It seemed pretty popular.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried my fair share of tanning lotions out there and try to give anything new a shot.  </li>
            <li> The JWOWW Black Bronzer is awesome!</li>
            <li> , it should work just fine.</li>
            <li> This is the best Black Bronzer ever.</li>
            <li> Thank you Allure Tanning Salons and Spa for your quick shipment in delivery!</li>
            <li> My skin is fair, I guess you could say, in the winter I am quite pale, but in summer I do tan nicely (I&#x27;m Sicilian)!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t streak, you&#x27;re never orange, and the smell is pleasantly neutral (a big plus for a guy, as so many lotions today have a floral \\&quot;feminine\\&quot;</li>
            <li> The lotion is amazing after 2 days in a regular tanning bed using this lotion I received so many compliments!</li>
            <li> your looking for a great lotion with an awesome scent that won&#x27;t leave you smelling like you&#x27;ve just walked out of a bar, go get Solid Black.</li>
            <li> But overall very pleased!</li>
            <li> Just be careful to rub it in very good after tanning</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a good lotion with a good scent and makes you very dark,  </li>
            <li> I have used many diffrent indoor tanning products but this one has given me that nice natural color I have been looking for.</li>
            <li> It makes me so tan, just using it one time makes a HUGE difference.  </li>
            <li> I am now a HUGE fan of damn JWOWW</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed a HUGE change in one session.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There was a HUGE color difference, &amp; scent difference between the two lotions.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I came home and looked on here and found it for so cheap.</li>
            <li> I changed up some of my lotions but kept coming back to this one because it worked great protecting my skin while giving the desired glow i wanted.  </li>
            <li> They told us they use this Bronzer religiously on the beach with great results.  </li>
            <li> Its light, so it doesnt feel sticky or caked on or anything.</li>
            <li> it says berry scent, but honestly i cant really smell that.</li>
            <li> I honestly wasn&#x27;t expecting that much from this lotion</li>
            <li> It makes my skin smooth</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> Not only does it smell great, but it doesn&#x27;t leave your skin slimy.</li>
            <li> I bought this last week after hearing lots of great reviews.</li>
            <li> and I won&#x27;t even use it for free let alone pay for it.</li>
            <li> Great product would definitely recommend and will buy again when I run out.</li>
            <li> Not only does it smell great (like berries)</li>
            <li> it goes on really smooth and feels silky</li>
            <li> , it goes on so smooth</li>
            <li> my guess is that they still want to move the product and that is why it is so cheap...</li>
            <li> Has a silky texture, so it goes on smooth and you dont have to use a lot.</li>
            <li> and I enjoy the smell</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using this line of tanning products.</li>
            <li> Not only does it smell great, you can use it as an outdoor tanning lotion as well.</li>
            <li> Also makes my skin feel incredibly smooth.</li>
            <li> if your looking for a light tan this is the product to go with.</li>
            <li> My fiance purchased this for me for my birthday recently; I had read a lot of reviews and it sounded great</li>
            <li> I am biracial but on the light side</li>
            <li> It feels so smooth on your skin also.  </li>
            <li> The consistency of this lotion is watery &amp; there is no \\&quot;berry\\&quot; smell, but a light perfume like smell.</li>
            <li> I have confirmed this with Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Im a light Latino...</li>
            <li> My mother-in-law can&#x27;t help but, to lose her cheap stuff</li>
            <li> It rubs in well into your skin and makes you feel smooth.</li>
            <li> It goes on silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> It is very moisturizing and smells nice.  </li>
            <li> plus, it leaves the skin smooth.</li>
            <li> The lotion is light and oily and leaves me smelling like beer.</li>
            <li> Great price especially compared to the salon price.</li>
            <li> See if that&#x27;s what you are looking for, and if you decide to buy online make sure to ONLY buy from sellers with good reputations.</li>
            <li> Works ok, not as good as I expected but ok.</li>
            <li> So far, so good.  </li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> I first tried this lotion as a sample and fell in love right away!!</li>
            <li> No streaks and i was able to see results right away.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend it and i will be buying more of her product!</li>
            <li> it works great outside and leaves a rich tan color.</li>
            <li> I used this for the first time today and I am already noticing a difference!!</li>
            <li> I was amazed at how fast this made it to my front door!!!</li>
            <li> i just bought this lotion today and iam so much darker!!!</li>
            <li> I was fairly excited when I found this product for so cheap on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Then I was just not tanning as quick and as easy as I had been.</li>
            <li> I have tried pretty much everything on the market just to say whats good and whats not.</li>
            <li> I loved how easy it was apply and it rub it smoothly and evenly without me having to constantly keep rubbing it in.  </li>
            <li> I do feel like I smell very strongly like the lotion after I&#x27;m finished, though, which I don&#x27;t really like.</li>
            <li> 5 stars all the way , and be wise, and buy from amazon, unless you don&#x27;t mind paying $50 for it :O !</li>
            <li> My only reason for not being super excited about this product, is that my European Gold lotion from Walmart (about $8) just works better (it&#x27;s the best stuff I&#x27;ve ever tried, including the super pricey ones from my tanning salon).  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t smell AS good as I remembered but it still smells better than most and for what it&#x27;s actually for it does very well.</li>
            <li> -The scent is definitely NOT berry, though I find it is light, pleasant and non-threatening.</li>
            <li> The first time i used it I fell in love with them smell and wheni got out of the tanning bed</li>
            <li> totally worth the purchase!</li>
            <li> The bronzer I was using before, \\&quot;Smile!</li>
            <li> I was really excited to try Jwow, because i hear a lot about it.</li>
            <li> i was so excited to try jwoww seeing</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the seller I purchased from, but I was not too impressed with this lotion.  </li>
            <li> but well worth it!</li>
            <li> me tell you, this is some powerful stuff!  </li>
            <li> It was worth the wait to order it online!</li>
            <li> well worth the money!</li>
            <li> but I think it be okay for first time tanners</li>
            <li> It came with its original seal that even salons take off before selling.</li>
            <li> So I was superrrr excited to try Jwowws tanning lotion, come to find out</li>
            <li> I just tried this today after being so excited about it.  </li>
            <li> First, I love the way this stuff smells before and after tanning.</li>
            <li> This is the first tanning lotion I&#x27;ve ever tried and I really love it.</li>
            <li> As an avid tanned, I have used many lotions.</li>
            <li> I received it Friday and went tanning on Saturday morning was so excited to use.</li>
            <li> After going tanning just twice with this, I noticed a significant difference from the lotion I had purchased from the salon.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t thinki got original packaging.</li>
            <li> Okay so when i first ordered this product from amazon</li>
            <li> I was truly excited to purchase this lotion however after waiting for 4 weeks for this product it came unsealed, and busted up in the box.</li>
            <li> I am pretty sure</li>
            <li> Just what I ordered &amp; came really fast &amp; wrapped new, product is great, love this product, works amazing its a repurchase I have made several times</li>
            <li> I thought so much of this lotion that I decided to give it 5 stars easily!</li>
            <li> I tried this after reading a review, and just as the person stated, it smelled good and gave a nice dark tan!</li>
            <li> It is great and really creates a natural color</li>
            <li> Left my skin nice not yucky or needing more moisture.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really smell that smell at all, it smells more like a perfumed body lotion, and I actually enjoy the smell.</li>
            <li> Not only did it tan my naturally olive complexion perfectly, but it helped me get over my plateau.  </li>
            <li> I find that Designer Skin Black tanning lotion works better then this if you want to get great results fast. :)</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite!</li>
            <li> I bought this first because I loved the bottle and second because I had done some research and realized this was a top notch choice for tanning bed use.</li>
            <li> It gives great color, goes on smooth, and I didn&#x27;t break out from it like I have other ones.  </li>
            <li> This is a good lotion, but truly isn&#x27;t any better than other lotions in its price range.</li>
            <li> I went in one day and they were having a special on this J Woww tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> This lotion is nothing special.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed the product to a certain point.</li>
            <li> its nothing special.</li>
            <li> It does the job, but nothing too special</li>
            <li> Did not get burned, but nothing special.</li>
            <li> Nothing special.</li>
            <li> And the price is right!</li>
            <li> I started looking darker right away!</li>
            <li> i was super excited because i heard such good things about this product.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t super strong, but it&#x27;s just right.</li>
            <li> Great color in minimal time.</li>
            <li> The lotion smells so good and the color after tanning looks pretty natural.</li>
            <li> I just recently used Jwoww&#x27;s lotion and I can say it was a pretty great lotion.</li>
            <li> We have only used it outdoors and the results have been been good.</li>
            <li> Of course I would never pay full price for anything there.</li>
            <li> To be honest, I didn&#x27;t even know who J Wow was when I bought it.  </li>
            <li> Recommend highly! :)</li>
            <li> I definitely got a good deal on it.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing, and really works for people with fair skin, without leaving you red, or funny colored from the bronzer in the lotion.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve had way better results; I don&#x27;t really see any darker results with this one.</li>
            <li> Sweet, but in no way floral.</li>
            <li> i have fair skin that doesn&#x27;t tan outside, and i must use the tanning bed.</li>
            <li> FULL PRICE AT TANNING SALON</li>
            <li> But i did get it in mail fast :)</li>
            <li> The guy at my local salon gave me a sample of the JWoww lotion to try and I loved it.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t so sure about this lotion, but I actually really like it.  </li>
            <li> well I have used it for about 5 mon now to really get the product used in many ways</li>
            <li> by the time you get out of the bed, you&#x27;re ready to get dressed and leave, no sweat, no grim.</li>
            <li> It coats evenly and smells good but smell doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d definitely recommend to anyone looking to have a gorgeous tan color.</li>
            <li> The golden lid will stay secure, so your lotion will not be compromised.</li>
            <li> Overall it is a good product.</li>
            <li> Throwing it out the second I receive my GOOD lotion in the mail.</li>
            <li> do it - just enough to soak into my skin and feel good.</li>
            <li> Overall, good product.</li>
            <li> I have a nice even natural looking tan.</li>
            <li> Good lotion, personally - I&#x27;m not a fan of the smell, but it isn&#x27;t a deal breaker.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a tanning lotion connoisseur, so this seems to be good enough for what I need, a tanning boost.</li>
            <li> the shipping is so fast i love not having to wait days on my product.</li>
            <li> The scent does block out that tanning smell (plus), but given that you smell like sickly sweet berries, I have to shower immediately after using it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Ive used this product before and absolutely loved the results only with one use.</li>
            <li> Designer Skin makes some really good ones that are relatively inexpensive as well.  </li>
            <li> Good smell, lasting color</li>
            <li> fair skin.i will definitely recommend this tanning lotion</li>
            <li> I would say if you are just starting it is good</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s still not bad at all.</li>
            <li> (It&#x27;s not a bad smell, I just don&#x27;t like it)</li>
            <li> It works great and the smell is amazing it leaves your skin soft and not sticky like other lotions would.</li>
            <li> I purchased it because it was the right price to get free shipping with my purchase of tanning goggles.</li>
            <li> (Do keep in mind, this was a $20 product, and that&#x27;s all I would ever spend on a lotion, but I&#x27;m sure the more expensive ones would be much better if you&#x27;re willing to pay, but this one is great for the price.)</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t produce that tingling, burning sensation that I&#x27;ve experienced with other lotions, depending on their brand.</li>
            <li> I bought this due to the rave of it and thought it will be great , without reading any reviews....</li>
            <li> Other than that it is great plus it&#x27;s wayyyyyyy cheaper on here than it is in the salons.</li>
            <li> It smells great and gives my skin a nice, natural dark tan that lasts.</li>
            <li> Also, the JWOWW bronzer was priced at $55 at the salon I go to, thanks to Amazon.com, I scored this great product at half the cost. : )</li>
            <li> Now on to the lotion: I am a loyal Designer Skin fan</li>
            <li> If I want to get tan quick, I use this lotion.  </li>
            <li> That being said, many promised that they smelled great and didn&#x27;t leave you smelling like that icky tanning bed smell.</li>
            <li> moisturizes adequately  </li>
            <li> -Dries quickly  </li>
            <li> but I notice it fades fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t find it is tanning me as quick as the reviews i read.</li>
            <li> I bought this tanning lotion about a month ago from Amazon.com, it came in the mail rather quick.</li>
            <li> I recieved my jwoww tanning lotion super quick...great communication from seller...</li>
            <li> It creates super-fast results with no orange tinting (insert joke here), goes on easily, doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or oily, and the scent is so pleasant and clean, I&#x27;m hoping a line of moisturizers is soon to follow.</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly, and it was sealed.</li>
            <li> shipped quickly</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> I can safely say I will be buying more of this in the future.</li>
            <li> This one doesn&#x27;t plus it tans my skin quickly.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is also very nice   Nice natural dark tan ...</li>
            <li> THIS LOTION WAS RATED SO GREAT FOR MAKING YOU DARK.</li>
            <li> This is the very first time I have ever reviewed anything.</li>
            <li> It smells beautiful and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on the skin.</li>
            <li> Paying the extra $15 at the salon is more than worth it!!</li>
            <li> The smell seemed strong at first but it is amazing - no gross after tan smell.</li>
            <li> It goes on very silky and smooth, rubs in easily and very moisturising and non sticky!</li>
            <li> I only use high power beds or bronzing beds for great benefits of indoor tanning.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to anyone who wants a nice lotion.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THE SMELL AND GIVES YOU A NICE DARK TAN.</li>
            <li> Jwoww Black Bronzer is great for anyone who loves to tan.  </li>
            <li> Pretty good bronzer definitely helped me get the tan</li>
            <li> About the actual product, it&#x27;s pretty good.  </li>
            <li> It has a really nice smell, and has made me really dark brown:)</li>
            <li> I actually got a better tab from one of the samples packaged with it!</li>
            <li> It worked the first time i used it!</li>
            <li> and I saw a difference after the first session!</li>
            <li> I got it around the end of my first month of tanning, and was so excited.</li>
            <li> I really like this as well!!</li>
            <li> Came exactly as it was described!</li>
            <li> Today was my first day to tan!</li>
            <li> but this product made me so tan after the first use!</li>
            <li> You can tell a difference in the first use!</li>
            <li> After reading several reviews stating that I will love the scent, I couldn&#x27;t wait to pop off the cap and start smelling!</li>
            <li> It is much cheaper than the salon price!!</li>
            <li> My favorite tanning lotion by far!</li>
            <li> Thanks Jenny!!</li>
            <li> This lotion got me tan fast!!</li>
            <li> As far as the scent, it&#x27;s relatively mild compared to most.  </li>
            <li> I received this item quick, and used it right away.</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly and is priced right.  </li>
            <li> It smells good, but that&#x27;s about the only positive thing I could think of.</li>
            <li> This Jwoww Black Bronzer is a very nice tanning lotion.  </li>
            <li> Also, I am very light skinned and after only one week I could tell a huge difference</li>
            <li> It did have a pleasant smell compared to other products ive used.</li>
            <li> I really like the fragrance and the smooth application.  </li>
            <li> My tanning lotion can fast and they even sent me free samples along with the bottle.</li>
            <li> The scent is very light(extremely important to me) and you don&#x27;t smell like a tanning bed after using it.  </li>
            <li> I was white as a ghost and started out with this (as I have before) and the results are truly amazing.</li>
            <li> It smells amazing and actually gives my tan a boost!</li>
            <li> Gives a nice overall bronze color..  </li>
            <li> Only used it 3 times and already have a nice tan.</li>
            <li> There are much better choices available for the same price.</li>
            <li> So basically this lotion is worth the buy.</li>
            <li> I have used countless lotions from over $100 to $10 lotion, and this one I would honestly say is in the bottom 10%.</li>
            <li> It was worth the cost.  </li>
            <li> Well first of all, I gave it 2 stars only because it smells pretty good.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.  </li>
            <li> SO DEFINITELY WORTH THE MONEY.</li>
            <li> This product is well worth</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so dark\\&quot; moments, but I did notice a really nice overall tan effect-</li>
            <li> I used it in a bed as well, but I love it in the natural sun too.</li>
            <li> I used it yesterday and today and so far I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite lotion.</li>
            <li> I paid about $20 for it, and consider it worth the money.</li>
            <li> Its by far my favorite and</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> As far as the lotion itself, it&#x27;s my favorite out of all the ones I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I think its worth it.</li>
            <li> I doubt this is what Jwoww really uses LoL because it is really not very bronzing.</li>
            <li> My favorite lotion so far.</li>
            <li> it smells somewhat the same but its not as effective at all</li>
            <li> Gives a nice deep tan when used in my tanning bed.</li>
            <li> It went on very smoothly and it smells really really good, and last a long time after your out of the tanning bed.</li>
            <li> It worked ok ( better than some other cheaper brands)</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Of course you need to stay consistent in tanning or it fads fairly quick.</li>
            <li> SUPER FAST DELIVERY!</li>
            <li> It smells pretty decent and you can tell a difference right after you go tan!!</li>
            <li> not as good as other jwow lotions ive used.</li>
            <li> I am rating tihs lower due to the fact that it just isnt that good of a deal for the cost.</li>
            <li> It went on thick, not expired that I could tell, and smelled good too!</li>
            <li> Yes, other reviews are right - smells good.</li>
            <li> and I went right through it.</li>
            <li> , right?</li>
            <li> It gets me tan right away.</li>
            <li> Worked well used it in a bronzing bed and it browned me right up</li>
            <li> I have used it 3 times and noticed a difference right away.</li>
            <li> This product was right on with what I needed.</li>
            <li> Goes right into the skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;something wasn&#x27;t right.</li>
            <li> I noticed it right away.</li>
            <li> I got the item before I was expecting it so this was shipped off right away</li>
            <li> I live in the south and the sun is incredibly strong here.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the type that can sit outside and within 5 mins have a tan if its a nice hot day.</li>
            <li> I think the only good thing about this lotion is that it doesn&#x27;t make you super greasy like many other lotions do.</li>
            <li> It is very natural looking, doesn&#x27;t have a strong odor, goes on evenly, and moisturizes well.  </li>
            <li> I own a tanning bed and from my experience try the jwoww one and done advanced black bronzer..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a thinner lotion with a kind of weird light smell that kind of freshens after you tan</li>
            <li> The real product is much thicker and shows much better color much sooner.</li>
            <li> I have fair complexion and was worried that this may be too dark and be visible on my skin.  </li>
            <li> It gets you dark but doesn&#x27;t smell too good after tanning.</li>
            <li> The smell is nice and lasts for a long time.  </li>
            <li> This product really deepened my tan and quickly, too.</li>
            <li> This last year when I started my tanning sessions, I looked for a great bronzer, that wouldnt make me itch or turn me red as a lobster.</li>
            <li> It smells nice and is more of a thick type of lotion</li>
            <li> It gives results quickly and works very well</li>
            <li> I was expecting more color than I got when I used this, I tried it a few more times because I paid $40 for it</li>
            <li> special.. decent smell..</li>
            <li> It has a decent smell, not anything special.</li>
            <li> and it came very fast.</li>
            <li> i tan very fast anyways</li>
            <li> Works very fast to give you a darker tan</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping got it within a couple of days.</li>
            <li> but it is nowhere near what I have experienced with other lotions).  </li>
            <li> this lotion DOES give a good color, but it fades pretty quick :/  </li>
            <li> This lotion gave me a nice golden bronze color quicker than any other type of lotion I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> it was very light and non-greasy, i have been tanning for years, and it actually increased my tan (which is hard for me) plus the smell is great.</li>
            <li> First of all, The smell of this isn&#x27;t personally one that I like very much, but it&#x27;s not disgusting.</li>
            <li> The Amazon price is much cheaper than in-stores and it is SO worth it.</li>
            <li> I will purchase more items from this seller in the future.  </li>
            <li> This was my first bronzer besides tinglers.</li>
            <li> but I would def say it&#x27;s in my top ten.</li>
            <li> But other than that I enjoyed buying from this saler!</li>
            <li> This was my first bronzer</li>
            <li> The first couple times I used it, I did notice getting darker.</li>
            <li> I saw a difference the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> The first bottle I ordered through Amazon and will continue to order it through Amazon - there&#x27;s no point in paying $60-$75 for it at the salon, when I can save money ordering it through Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I will be buying this again very soon!</li>
            <li> I used this the first day of tanning this season, and in the one day, I have seen results.  </li>
            <li> overall I&#x27;m satisfied</li>
            <li> Much higher than that,</li>
            <li> I am an avid tanner.  </li>
            <li> I love the deep brown color it gives me.</li>
            <li> and if you look at the ingredients the Australian Gold has more ingredents</li>
            <li> EXACTLY</li>
            <li> at first when you get it on, but that is gone by the time you get out of the bed.</li>
            <li> When I first started using it in the tanning bed, I got a couple shades darker each time I went tanning.</li>
            <li> I used this product and noticed a difference within the first session.</li>
            <li> I used this lotion one time, my first time tanning in about a year.  </li>
            <li> Its soft and where I was breaking out from the cheap lotion my skin is clearing up</li>
            <li> i used it for the first time today ...</li>
            <li> The shipping was really fast also!</li>
            <li> Reasonable price!</li>
            <li> My advice is spend an extra $10 and get a way better tanning lotion or just go to a store and buy a $10 one.</li>
            <li> I ordered this lotion about 2 weeks ago and love the price I got it for especially since it sells in the tanning salon for $59!</li>
            <li> I could see a difference after the first use.</li>
            <li> And It Made Me Pretty Tan.</li>
            <li> And At A Reasonable Price!</li>
            <li> Thanks for making her smile.</li>
            <li> and itll have a funny smell....</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve definitely had better tanning lotions.</li>
            <li> This is definitely one of the better lotions out there</li>
            <li> I DONT LIKE THIS LOTION AS MUCH AS THE JWOW ONE &amp; DONE!</li>
            <li> Would definitely recommend, the price is much better than what you&#x27;ll find in the salons</li>
            <li> I could tell the first time I used it that I had a lil bit of color to me.</li>
            <li> U really must try it!</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d try this lotion since I see it in the salon at a much higher cost.  </li>
            <li> It definetely makes the tanning experience much faster!</li>
            <li> It was the first bottle I bought when I started tanning.  </li>
            <li> This is the exact product as the one in the tanning salons.</li>
            <li> When I first went I used a lotion my sister gave me</li>
            <li> ;)  </li>
            <li> I will definitely purchase this lotion again :)</li>
            <li> and I have now gone twice, 7 mins the first day and 9</li>
            <li> but I saw results after my first session with this lotion.</li>
            <li> Im naturally medium light.</li>
            <li> My daughter &amp; I use it and it seems to work pretty well.</li>
            <li> I have been an avid tanner for about 7 years</li>
            <li> you get it SO much cheaper then in the tanning salon!</li>
            <li> Now that I have used some, it is not nearly as difficult.</li>
            <li> Very plesed!</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I ordered</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference in my skin color even after the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> I had immediate results and it looked even better the next day.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s exactly what I got with this lotion.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s different for everyone.</li>
            <li> and this product does exactly what it is supposed to.</li>
            <li> Definitely a way better buy than paying $50 at salon.</li>
            <li> and I we have tried several lotions and this is one of the better ones.</li>
            <li> The first thing that made me suspicious was the lack of seal on the bottle.</li>
            <li> Love that I can buy this tanning lotion for my personal tanning bed.</li>
            <li> I will admit, the shipping was fast!</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> I use many different tanning lotions.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I love it, only tanned for three days an use it</li>
            <li> It is ok for a temporary cover but rubs off the next day</li>
            <li> I know all of them have an after tan smell, but this one is pretty bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> isnt greasy afterwards, and i saw results after the first time using it</li>
            <li> First off the bottle is not sealed when you get it (like medicines are).</li>
            <li> this lotion made me darker after first use and it does smell yummy.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Allstar Tanning Products!</li>
            <li> The day after the first time I used it, I had three complete strangers remark about how fantastic my tan looked.</li>
            <li> I bought this same product at my tanning salon and it cost a lot more.  </li>
            <li> I actually think I get better color with the one that I ordered on line than the one I bought in the salon.  </li>
            <li> It smells good &amp; I have used it a few times.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite tanning lotion, the price is right , it makes me so dark , leaves my skin feeling silky smooth, and doesn&#x27;t leave you smelling burned after you tan !</li>
            <li> I am a fair skinned girl who doesn&#x27;t tan that easily, but JWOWW has definitely helped me get dark.  </li>
            <li> Was here much sooner than expected, love this tanning lotion!</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion because there were a ton of positive reviews, but i was very disapointed!</li>
            <li> I have been able to only tan once a week and have amazing dark color.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hurt that it smells nice too unlike other lotions.  </li>
            <li> I always purchase very good quality , tanning lotion , usually I buhy designer , long ago , I was always purchasing , Australian Gold &lt; or Swedish Beauty , now , I read the feedback  of this lotion , and I decided to give it a try , and I&#x27;m very happy , very dark,</li>
            <li> It is a definite buy is you are a serious tanner, looking for a great dark, beautiful even tan.</li>
            <li> and I am able to use it on my lunch hour since it doesn&#x27;t smell really perfumie especially since I work somewhere</li>
            <li> It is my favorite bronzer so far, and I have tanned since I was about 16 years old and have tried a lot of products.</li>
            <li> Much better price here as I have paid 4 times as much for this same bottle in salons.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this lotion twice - which is why I&#x27;m giving it four stars, not five; will update to 5 stars later if the results continue to be good -  </li>
            <li> I have tried my fair share of tanning lotions, from expensive (Designer Skin) to super cheap (some brand from Sally&#x27;s beauty store.)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been tanning for several years and although it is not my favorite lotion, it is pretty high up there.</li>
            <li> but thats all I can say thats positive.</li>
            <li> Smells decent, isn&#x27;t greasy, and soaks right into skin.</li>
            <li> It smells amazing and gets me so dark every time.</li>
            <li> It claims it has a great smell, it doesn&#x27;t smell any different than any other tanning lotion out there.</li>
            <li> First of all, I NEVER take the time to write reviews about products, but I felt I absolutely had to about this one.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t review on the &amp;#34;speed&amp;#34; of it since I tan pretty fast with just about any lotion I use.</li>
            <li> I received it pretty fast.</li>
            <li> When I tanned when I first got it, it really made a difference.</li>
            <li> but when the bronzer wares away there isnt much of a diffrence in my accual skin color and it was my first time tanning for the season</li>
            <li> I had use a small pack at the tanning salon and loved it...</li>
            <li> I usually use a tingle and decided to try JWOWW because I had heard good things about.  </li>
            <li> use it whenever I wanted a good rich tan especially a few workout.</li>
            <li> This one is not so much sweet, it just smells like old tanning lotion to me.</li>
            <li> I am fair skin and it usually take some time to see any color on me.</li>
            <li> It goes on nice and thick, it smells great, but I&#x27;m still pale as a ghost 2 months into tanning.</li>
            <li> Everbody has their own preferences when it comes to consistency, for me the light, easy to rub on texture was perfect as I hate the thick creamy ones.  </li>
            <li> ;) a few other lotions i LOVED that had good lasting color were: designer skin belezza and designer skin queen!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pale but tan very easily and get a golden color</li>
            <li> I would recommend this lotion to anyone who is wanting a quick and natural looking tan.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been tanning for a good long time now, in tanning beds and outside.</li>
            <li> Once you&#x27;re at a certain darkness though it doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well.</li>
            <li> i would certainly buy again</li>
            <li> I get to a healthy looking tan (my pale self&#x27;s version of tan) with in 3-4 tans, and I don&#x27;t go full time</li>
            <li> Not as strong as I thought it would be, but it does give a natural tan look and it helps tan my legs which do not tan normally in natural sunlight or tanning beds.</li>
            <li> Got great color really fast!I&#x27;m very pale naturally and was so surprised how quickly I noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> I especially loved the amazon price, less than half of what the salon charges!   </li>
            <li> i have paid alot less for much better lotions with alot better results, just sayin, but hey its gonna be a big hit eigther</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, so most lotions tend to cause rashes but all of jwoww&#x27;s products do not do that and not to mention the rich dark tan I get from these lotions.</li>
            <li> The first couple of times I used it, I didn&#x27;t apply too much lotion, and still got decent amount of color.</li>
            <li> , JWOWW&#x27;s  Black Bronzer left me a very nice medium shade after about five uses.</li>
            <li> I am not greasy, but my skin does feel VERY soft!!</li>
            <li> Really excells your tanning prosses.  </li>
            <li> I really like this lotion</li>
            <li> I really like the smell</li>
            <li> Jenny&#x27;s smells light and doesn&#x27;t overpower but the that is second to the results.  </li>
            <li> I WOULD NEVER pay that much for tanning lotion and to think that was the clearance</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t see much if any difference.</li>
            <li> The lotion is on the liquidy side and doesnt have as much moisture to it.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a whole another topic.</li>
            <li> It was very itchy and it hurt.</li>
            <li> but i really dont want to put this stuff on my skin again either.</li>
            <li> and I really like the feel of it on my skin</li>
            <li> and after you tan, and lasts longer than the thicker tanning lotions that are out there, you dont have to use nearly as much.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll save so much money and mine</li>
            <li> Thanks amazon and JWOWW</li>
            <li> but I tan real well for some reason.</li>
            <li> I thought the price for this was reasonable and this package arrived in 2 business days.</li>
            <li> I found this cheaper version, and thought it was the real stuff, but i gotta say i don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the real jwow because it gave me orange streaks on my legs...</li>
            <li> this lotion doesn&#x27;t make me smell like burned skin when I am done tanning, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s very moisterizing.  </li>
            <li> I just have to moisterize really well after tanning, but I do that anyway, so</li>
            <li> and i used the whole bottle</li>
            <li> I have notice much quicker results using this lotion compared to others.</li>
            <li> thanks homies</li>
            <li> He tans much easier than I do.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> i will be totally ready for my outdoor wedding and looking tan.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all and really works as it should.</li>
            <li> Product came on time and was wrapped up extra secure.</li>
            <li> -Don&#x27;t expect it to bronze you overnight, as it doesn&#x27;t really do much of it.  </li>
            <li> -It has a somewhat unusual consistency.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s taken my 5 months to get really tan.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know if it would work that fast</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended and I will def buy again !</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s watery compared to the others I&#x27;ve used and didn&#x27;t really help me tan at all.</li>
            <li> Absolutely a joke dont buy this and save yourself the hives and rashes that comes with it.</li>
            <li> but this product works very well for me.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> REALLY</li>
            <li> The solution this is made from really works.</li>
            <li> After using it just once, (i didn&#x27;t even tan the whole time.</li>
            <li> But after a Month of Continuous use, I dont look much tanner.</li>
            <li> I really saw results.</li>
            <li> Really though, that happens with any bronzer lotion.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was fast too.  </li>
            <li> But didnt complain too much.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, no problems.</li>
            <li> I was using another lotion that did absolutely nothing for me.</li>
            <li> Came fast a++±</li>
            <li> and I used almost the whole bottle.</li>
            <li> The lotion works very well</li>
            <li> The color appears as fast as it fades.</li>
            <li> and I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference when using this, wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> Lotion is better than expected.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> the shipping was fast, the package was sealed, and there were not dents or dings.</li>
            <li> I had purchased another tanning lotion but just didn&#x27;t seem to really be getting any darker.</li>
            <li> This lotion worked really well for me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is the real deal.</li>
            <li> So I was nervous about purchasing lotion online because I know some people who have received baby lotion instead of the real stuff.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is real indoor tanning lotion, used it in tanning bed and started itching and burned.</li>
            <li> I absolutely recommend.</li>
            <li> I really like the smell</li>
            <li> Thanks guys.</li>
            <li> fast shipping.</li>
            <li> but this lotion works very well .</li>
            <li> but I was expecting it to help me get much darker.  </li>
            <li> Fast delivery,  no problems</li>
            <li> Very even tan, can&#x27;t wait to keep using this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> I had used a much cheaper product than this and was much happier with the end results of it over this product.  </li>
            <li> really well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tanned really fast</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very picky with my tanning lotions, but this one just worked SO well.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t really get the job done if you wanna get REALLY tan</li>
            <li> nobody wants that saggy skin.</li>
            <li> I really like the gold bottle</li>
            <li> Extremely fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t the real stuff .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very berry scent, so unless you like smelling like berry bubble gum all day, don&#x27;t get this.</li>
            <li> I really think they just poured Jergens lotion into this bottle...</li>
            <li> I was really hesitant about buying tanning lotion online</li>
            <li> It got my tan really fast</li>
            <li> Shipping is fast.</li>
            <li> this one will take about the whole product to get about nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very inexpensive on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> So whats really in this bottle?</li>
            <li> I used it but really wanted one that gave me a darker tan.</li>
            <li> What she told me absolutely disgusts me.</li>
            <li> Basically, people who sell this stuff for cheap online aren&#x27;t actually selling you what you think they are.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> It works really well.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see much of a difference.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m very upset with this product.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to get some color before we go to the beach in july</li>
            <li> But had fast shippimg</li>
            <li> Shipped fast.</li>
            <li> but if you are looking to get tan fast</li>
            <li> havent used this that much.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t even the real jwoww lotion ..</li>
            <li> I love creams that go on smooth, thick and creamy.</li>
            <li> Considering it is an Australian Gold lotion, however, it probably smells wonderful and would bring me a nostalgic feeling of Florida like most tanning lotions (I spent most of my teen years in Florida, and then moved away to my undying chagrin.)  </li>
            <li> I am a blonde hair blue eyed fair skinned 22 year old girl..</li>
            <li> It went on good and it was thick</li>
            <li> An authentic product may have been shipped at one point, but this one is certainly not.</li>
            <li> Produces a very rich golden color within a few tanning sessions.</li>
            <li> Jwoww is WOW!!!  </li>
            <li> Easy to figure out if you cut the package off and see that the bottle underneath is not the same as the normal jwoww bottle.</li>
            <li> , I had not tanned in awhile and it has helped me get tan more quickly than I usually do.</li>
            <li> It tan me very wellI was pleased with this product I would recommend this product to other people who want to tan thanks</li>
            <li> I have fair skin and with the other tanning lotions I would just turn red and that would be it.</li>
            <li> I have had problems with other lotions turning me orange if I used them more than one time in a row, but I don&#x27;t have that problem with the jwoww.</li>
            <li> It helps her get darker better than other products which she loves.</li>
            <li> I recently ordered this lotion and was so excited to get it and use it.</li>
            <li> This is the same exact product thats in the tanning salons for more than double the price.i tested it out by buying a sample of it at the place i tan</li>
            <li> Bday gift for the wife, she really love how it feels on her skin and says &amp;#34;no other tanning lotion can compare&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Mine isn&#x27;t watery at all and has the original signature on the back.</li>
            <li> Although I had to wait FOREVER for this to arrive because of a back ordering issue, I have to say that this product was worth the wait!  </li>
            <li> Within just 2 weeks, I have a better tan than I did with other tannings lotions in a month of tanning.  </li>
            <li> Smells great and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I expected more from this lotion considering the high reviews and publicity.</li>
            <li> It smells great and doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling all gross after my tan (well grosser than I usually do)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this bronzer a few times and pretty satisfied with the result -  </li>
            <li> /&gt; Highly recommend got to me fast</li>
            <li> i had tried a packet of the jwow black bronzer at my local tanning salon, i loved the color it gave me</li>
            <li> One of the workers at the local salon told me to try out a packet of JWOWW&#x27;s Black Bronzer, and I LOVED IT!&lt;br</li>
            <li> it smells AMAZING and doesnt make u yellow or have a funny look at all it also doesnt make u really really dark</li>
            <li> They were incredibly dark and had healthy looking skin.  </li>
            <li> We always have a healthy dark tan.  </li>
            <li> Not only was it WAY cheaper on Amazon, but the reviews turned out to be true.</li>
            <li> Gets me dark every year :)</li>
            <li> It is definitely not worth $65 dollars, but for $20 I am pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> As an avid tanner, I have tried nearly every tanning lotion there is.  </li>
            <li> I was pretty surprised by that</li>
            <li> While it did make my skin pretty soft</li>
            <li> if you have a place that you love to go to and use this product, it will give you a really dark tan.</li>
            <li> and I tan pretty easily, but I already have a great base tan bc of this lotion</li>
            <li> I could care less about the name of the lotion, but I LOVE the fact that it works.  </li>
            <li> Now I use a tanning lotion from Sally&#x27;s, it&#x27;s less than $10 and works much better (quicker/darker results).    </li>
            <li> PAYING HALF PRICE IS MUCH BETTER THAN PAYING</li>
            <li> Just ordered designer skin black, hoping it works better than JWoww.</li>
            <li> It is misleading to label this lotion as a &#x27;black&#x27; bronzer since the color is more of a burnt orange after tanning.</li>
            <li> It took me a while to finally get a hold of JWoww&#x27;s lotion &amp; I&#x27;m so glad I finally did!</li>
            <li> I have tried many of the more expensive lotions and found this one to work just as well.  </li>
            <li> I have been able to keep moderate color by only tanning a couple times a week.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t look realistic.</li>
            <li> I mainly purchased this lotion because 1)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually pretty cheap and just go to walmart and get a $10 tanning lotion, but they never really worth.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s probably why I am not \\&quot;WOWW-ed\\&quot; with this particular one.</li>
            <li> The bronzer was the main reason I wanted the lotion being</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll give you decent color</li>
            <li> The tan lasts well too, I maintain maybe 2-3 times a week, but can still keep a decent color if I have to drop to once a week on occassion.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tanned quite a few times using this lotion already.. and to be honest, not seeing nearly the amount of color I should be seeing.  </li>
            <li> and I will definitely be purchasing more JWOWW products in the future.</li>
            <li> The absolute highlight was taking my shirt off at a doctor&#x27;s office and hearing a nurse say \\&quot;Wow!</li>
            <li> On top of that, the lotion consistency was a lot like Sinfully Black in that it was more liquid than most lotions, but not in a bad way, more like it spreads further because of its viscosity.  </li>
            <li> Pretty pricey when purchased at a tanning salon, and doesn&#x27;t fit the definition of a \\&quot;black bronzer\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY recommend it.</li>
            <li> I had immediate color after using this with a high pressure tanning bed.  </li>
            <li> I recommend it highly to everyone.  </li>
            <li> They price this one like it was a high quality brand.</li>
            <li> I realize they&#x27;ve got to make money - but that&#x27;s almost high way robbery.....</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly Recomended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this tanning lotion.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m not too sure of what this tanning lotion does other than make my skin soft and bronze me for about a day...</li>
            <li> It takes my tan to the next level, and even my boyfriend noticed my darker color after the first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend !</li>
            <li> Ok SO here&#x27;s a little lesson for all of you-</li>
            <li> and i was completely brown!!</li>
            <li> Left my skin really soft..  Loved the smell as well but didn&#x27;t get me very dark at all...  </li>
            <li> This lotion is far better than the most expensive products.</li>
            <li> As far as the product, it works really well.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first to buy tanning lotion at such a cheap price on Amazon but this stuff works amazing.</li>
            <li> It makes your skin soft and it tans really well.</li>
            <li> I expected it to be cheap looking and used</li>
            <li> Great smell and doesn&#x27;t leave any streaks or weird coloring.</li>
            <li> I have used almost the whole bottle and have developed no tan from it.</li>
            <li> and it sure didnt last long.</li>
            <li> I can put it on real quick and not worry about missing a spot.  </li>
            <li> , I only need to tan once a week maybe two times to keep a nice dark tan.</li>
            <li> It gave me a deep dark color after the first use and gets better every time.</li>
            <li> Golden bronze brown all perfectly mixed.</li>
            <li> It feels like normal lotion</li>
            <li> My Tan Is A Mix Between Like a Red Tint And A Golden Bronze.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t tan everyday &amp; can&#x27;t seem to get to the tanning bed most days</li>
            <li> The lotion smells nice (to me at least, I&#x27;ve had comments from others that say otherwise).</li>
            <li> I am pretty sure its because my tanning place sucks.</li>
            <li> this lotion is kind thick.</li>
            <li> bought it once for $50+ at tanning salon, then found it here for half the price, cant get enough of it, no tingling or burning, no greasy feel, smells AMAZING before</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll wait until the bottle is gone to decide if the \\&quot;black bronzer\\&quot; is worth it or not, but for now, I&#x27;m going to say it&#x27;s totally worth</li>
            <li> right after or 48 hrs later</li>
            <li> I can tell because I am obviously tanner right after applying it.</li>
            <li> only on the right side of my neck.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is ok for the price, but I am not sure I would purchase this particular product again.  </li>
            <li> or I&#x27;m just impatient but it doesn&#x27;t seem to have any significant effect on increasing my tan any more than any other product that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> &quot; it&#x27;s a salon where we live...</li>
            <li> this is my new standby bronzer lotion.</li>
            <li> About 6 tans in to my new tanning salon</li>
            <li> but it was new and after I compared it to the ones in the tanning place</li>
            <li> Tanning New Paint</li>
            <li> so I looked for something new and found this</li>
            <li> I tan using the new euro beds (new to me).</li>
            <li> But if your a new beginner in tanning don&#x27;t not use a tingle lotion it will burn the hell out of you.</li>
            <li> I did not think about this until it started to happen to me, so I think I&#x27;m going to have to get a new lotion.</li>
            <li> I like to try new tanning lotions</li>
            <li> And after reading the reviews (some good some bad) about the smell, let me tell you the smell is light and airy.</li>
            <li> The only thing was that I would have some color after tanning, then wake up the next morning and be light again.</li>
            <li> because it&#x27;s so thin, it kind of soaks into the skin too fast.</li>
            <li> The bronzer does not last more than 1 shower afterl that&#x27;s not really the way bronzer should work.</li>
            <li> first and foremost the salon tries to sell me this exact bottle for $85 dollars.</li>
            <li> I expected a much better product from Australian gold.</li>
            <li> I want to first start off by saying I tan easily and hardly ever burn.</li>
            <li> GREAT product if you&#x27;re a person not looking for a super duper deep dark tan, and are just looking for a nice base tan.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend this lotion to all tanners, beginner to professional.</li>
            <li> Very surprised with the results.</li>
            <li> , i was a very natural tan color.</li>
            <li> The only downside is the opening, it&#x27;s kind of hard to get the lotion out after I&#x27;ve already started getting ready</li>
            <li> I order this product and after having to anxiously wait for 2 1/2 weeks to arrive, I am glad I order it.</li>
            <li> This was my first \\&quot;Australian</li>
            <li> I have never seen my skin so smooth and dark.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get over how I went from pasty white to a couple shades higher in just 2 tanning sessions.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t decide to buy it directly from the tanning salon!</li>
            <li> I first used this in my tanning salon (the sample size) and I instantly noticed how tan I got!</li>
            <li> and I needed something to give me some color, after only laying 13 mins (didnt wanna fry myself first run)</li>
            <li> and I got my money back, because my friend that owns a tanning salon said that this is Jwows first ever tanning lotion..</li>
            <li> The smell is pretty gross!</li>
            <li> I will definitely be trying the other JWOWW lotions because this is my favorite lotion i&#x27;ve used ever.</li>
            <li> Ultimately, what you are paying for is the name and a pretty perfume scent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the exact same as you&#x27;d buy at the salon.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin so soft!</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> and it was the same exact thing.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll definitely see a difference the first time you use it.</li>
            <li> I still see a difference for sure from other bottles of same Jwoww product I purchased elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I usually never tan</li>
            <li> She grabbed a bottle of the same exact JWOW tanning lotion off of their shelf, &amp; squeezed out some of the lotion onto her finger, &amp; then some of my lotion onto another finger .</li>
            <li> do not waste your money!</li>
            <li> Have had great results out of the Australian Gold Jwoww Black Bronzer Dark Tanning Lotion.</li>
            <li> I really thought this woud be a great lotion, but I was very wrong.</li>
            <li> For a get quick tanning lotion, Id go with Swedish Beauty Pink Diamond.</li>
            <li> After using jwoww lotion only twice, my skin is soft and moisturized and it has really boosted the tan I already had!</li>
            <li> I love dark lasting bronzers so as soon as I finish this bottle</li>
            <li> The only thing I can say that is kind of sketchy about the product is it did not come sealed or plastic wrapped, not sure if the ones at the salon are or not.</li>
            <li> The back of my lotion where JWOW&#x27;s signature is her name in full cursive.</li>
            <li> Compared with other bronzing lotions I&#x27;ve used, this does nothing special.</li>
            <li> Not as good as little black bronzer</li>
            <li> I bought this product when I bought my other JWOWW lotion in the pink bottle and figured it would be just as amazing, but unfortunately it was not as good.</li>
            <li> I sampled this product at my local salon and found that after tanning my skin was so soft and my color was more natural after tanning than it had been with other products.  </li>
            <li> very light abd its hard for me to tan</li>
            <li> i would just be a lil mad if I paid $59 for it from my tanning salon because after taking a shower your color fades just a lil bit because it doesn&#x27;t have a lasting bronzer in it, other then that its very smooth and doesn&#x27;t leave you streaky or sticky and the smell is great even after tanning your skin</li>
            <li> and it smells nice, just not spectacular!</li>
            <li> A nice thick lotion too, and a lot cheaper than at the salon!</li>
            <li> I love this, i recently bought it from the tanning salon but will be ordering through amazon because its half the price.</li>
            <li> i saw better results from the australian gold sinfully black.</li>
            <li> they aren&#x27;t quite as expensive as black, but are still great!</li>
            <li> I have several tanning products, but the Jwoww Black Bronzer is my most used product.</li>
            <li> just enough making my naturally dry skin silky smooth.  </li>
            <li> My most recent lotion was Black Noir</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had better luck with this than the solid black 100x bronzer.</li>
            <li> it was a very smooth lotion, not to thick and not sticky at all.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> a pretty pale person, so either this isn&#x27;t the right product for my skin</li>
            <li> Product is cheap to buy on amazon, but still not worth the money!</li>
            <li> BRONZERS SHOULD BE LEFT ON FOR A DECENT AMOUNT OF TIME!</li>
            <li> and I was only getting in one of those older style tanning beds!</li>
            <li> Maybe not pale but far from tan.</li>
            <li> I have to say its a great product I was referred to amazon drom the young lady at the tanning salon because I was unhappy with a product I purchased at the salon and</li>
            <li> One issue: the decorative clear lid will fall off.</li>
            <li> My 17yr old loves loves loves it</li>
            <li> But doesn&#x27;t offer the wow of tan that it claims too.</li>
            <li> Id say yes the feel is creamy and soft.</li>
            <li> It was very itchy and red.</li>
            <li> (It&#x27;s sort of an old woman smell.)</li>
            <li> Also, I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Its from Australian Gold and the whole \\&quot;Jersey Shore\\</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this to others, and I really hope the price stays under $23.  </li>
            <li> so it looks natural and</li>
            <li> I have been using this for nearly 2 weeks, and CAN NOT tell a difference.  </li>
            <li> It makes your skin really soft too.</li>
            <li> but this is my least favorite out of all of them.</li>
            <li> It is not for people just beginning to tan or people who have tanned frequently.</li>
            <li> I purchased this lotion here on Amazon on Friday and recieved it early this afternoon.</li>
            <li> Not heavy like someothers.</li>
            <li> I have been using \\&quot;Made for Love\\&quot; which I really like, but I just wanted something different...</li>
            <li> I have tanned twice with this and have definitely developed a darker color than I had before.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been to the salon 7 times this season so far.  </li>
            <li> I have been tanning on and off since I was 18 years old.</li>
            <li> It seems like the real deal, has the berry smell, and I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in my tan after only two days.</li>
            <li> Can also be used in natural sun.</li>
            <li> I got a natural looking tan.</li>
            <li> I like the bronzer, it offers moisture</li>
            <li> I have had the real one it is NOT MADE BY Australian Gold..</li>
            <li> Kept my skin soft.  </li>
            <li> if I get real UV rays outside..</li>
            <li> Instead of feeling soft and silky</li>
            <li> ive used almost the entire bottle &amp; i am really tan.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 23 yr old Latina</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft after using it and stays that way for hours.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t the same as the real thing.</li>
            <li> I forgot my lotion one day, being completely oblivious for 2 months that this lotion wasn&#x27;t doing anything, and had to buy a sample packet at the tanning bed.</li>
            <li> Save it and get the lotion at the beds because this product is a complete fraud.</li>
            <li> tan frequently, and wanted to try something now with a bronzer.</li>
            <li> I need color that looks natural and this is it.</li>
            <li> I get very noticeable tan lines on my shoulders when I mow the grass outside</li>
            <li> I went 4 times at 8 minutes,3 times at 10 minutes, and 1 time at 12 minutes so far.</li>
            <li> The lotion smells ok, not amazing.</li>
            <li> I am fair and have a difficult time tanning</li>
            <li> got the item right on time - was different packaging but it appears to be the same product.</li>
            <li> Jwoww&#x27;s Black Bronzer was my first really quality tanning lotion.  </li>
            <li> I find myself not having to go as often because it tans so dark, quickly.</li>
            <li> Now I would be super dark if I had not stopped tanning</li>
            <li> Gets you dark really quick.  </li>
            <li> I was also a little worried that the lotion might be frozen or burst open because I live in michigan, but it came perfectly fine.</li>
            <li> Gets you a nice light brown color but nothing too fancy and dark sadly.</li>
            <li> its getting me dark enough to counteract the no-tanning-bed-smell, huge plus.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed about this lotion is that it smells and feels quite similar to a cheaper Designer Skin lotion I used to get at my local beauty supply.</li>
            <li> I am getting married in a month and need to get rid of my white white skin.</li>
            <li> I got a nice brown color and didn&#x27;t get any pink like I usually do.</li>
            <li> Overall a decent lotion</li>
            <li> Im not sure what to exect.why do i have to have ten more words?</li>
            <li> This lotion would be great for a first time tanner or someone that needs a base tan.</li>
            <li> When you exfoliate really well in the shower, your shade of color may tone down a lot more than you would think, and you&#x27;ll be a little more than surprised to see your dark color isn&#x27;t as dark as you truly thought.  </li>
            <li> it had made me so dark and the shimmer it gives is so pretty!</li>
            <li> you can tell a difference in one lay..gets ya dark fast and doesnt fade!!</li>
            <li> I had such high hopes for this product.</li>
            <li> they smell amazing, protect tattoos, yogurt base and full of antioxidants!</li>
            <li> I think most people who buy products off Amazon for $50 cheaper than normal don&#x27;t understand that you&#x27;re buying it either expired or its only half tanning lotion &amp; half normal lotion.</li>
            <li> I heard its so cheap because they only fill it half way</li>
            <li> and I went and used it wow it made me dark on top of my already dark tan.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on more expensive products when i believe this product is better than them.</li>
            <li> At first I was really curious about this lotion and thought it was &amp;#34;one of those celebrity lotion</li>
            <li> once again, this may not work for pale people, or those who turn red easily, but for ppl with my tone of skin....</li>
            <li> Used it about three times and was super dark!</li>
            <li> I am a pale girl, and this is the only product I have used that actually works for me!! :)</li>
            <li> Winter is getting me down , so I decided to try Jwoww for fun.</li>
            <li> I burn fairly easily and it&#x27;s hard for me to get tan sometimes, but this lotion does the trick.  </li>
            <li> my skin tone is medium to dark, I get tan easily even outside, never turn red.  </li>
            <li> Goes on smooth, I&#x27;m not real happy with the smell</li>
            <li> My skin was still soft after using this product but it didnt get me my fast tan that the JWOWW in the Pink Bottle did.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll give it a few more tries until I call it quits with JWOWW.</li>
            <li> Being of Asian and Caucasian mixed decent, my skin is naturally tan.</li>
            <li> I should have known there was a reason for only paying a third of the real price...</li>
            <li> because you only get a third of the real product (if even that).</li>
            <li> The REAL bottle of lotion was dark &amp; smelled amazing, while my fake bottle I bought off Amazon was fairly light &amp; smelled slightly  like hand Sanitizer.</li>
            <li> Like this product a lot, doesn&#x27;t smell bad, smells pretty good actually.</li>
            <li> so I wasn&#x27;t expecting to see any major contrast in color from the lotion alone.</li>
            <li> is major congestion...</li>
            <li> but I love this lotion, and I would reccomend it to people who already have a good base tan wanting to btw really dark.</li>
            <li> Definitely helped me achieve a dark look quickly.</li>
            <li> It smells great and didn&#x27;t leave a tingling feeling or any other weird feelings afterwards.</li>
            <li> On the Amazon items display photo, it is just a large pink \\&quot;J\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There are probably other lotions that would make you super dark in a shorter amount of time but this one is fairly decent.</li>
            <li> Definitely consider this JWOWW Black Bronzer if your looking for quick results.</li>
            <li> I highly recomment this lotion, smells awesome and doesn&#x27;t leave the nasty residue</li>
            <li> I tan pretty easily, but I have had lotions in the past that didn&#x27;t get me real dark and others that just turned me BROWN..</li>
            <li> doesnt smell too bad and works great.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and a little goes a long way!  </li>
            <li> It as if Australian Gold whipped together an old lotion and bottled it..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it 3 times thus far</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only got to use it once so far</li>
            <li> It is a tad sticky (just barely)</li>
            <li> item came in and is not the &amp;#34;real deal&amp;#34; Has a shrink wrap covering that isn&#x27;t even placed on bottle properly, and a total different label then the real one.</li>
            <li> I used this only once so far</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t get nearly the results as I did with JWOWW&#x27;s Australian Gold.</li>
            <li> , I have used the product in the past straight from the salon and it is the exact same thing!</li>
            <li> My legs are getting back to normal but its taken over 4 weeks of scrubbing and non use of this lotion for it to go back.</li>
            <li> The last two times I went, I used A LOT of lotion and noticed that I got SUPER dark!</li>
            <li> I love the Australian Gold Black Bronzer Dark Tanning Lotion.  </li>
            <li> I live in Canada, so that was probably why it took so long.</li>
            <li> I had ordered my JWOWW Black of Amazon (A-Z Wholesale Tanning Lotions to be exact) while using my Amazon Prime account.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical only because of the JWOWW endorsement, but after using it I know that I will by this again, and I have never bought a tanning lotion more than once!</li>
            <li> This really works well in an Extreme tanning bed..</li>
            <li> But in all seriousness, this lotion really does its job, gets you way darker than any other lotions I&#x27;ve tried, and</li>
            <li> Only problem now is I&#x27;m not extremely dark.</li>
            <li> definitely recommend this for fair skin as long as you are used to tanning and know how well or difficult it is for you to get color from the tanning bed.</li>
            <li> It smells nice, is a good consistency (not too thick, not too runny), and the after-tan smell is not as bad as with other lotions I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> I had been using a cheap lotion because I didn&#x27;t believe the hype that the expensive lotions really worked.  </li>
            <li> She said they used to sell it, and it was always a big hit with people who were already pretty dark.  </li>
            <li> and there is nothing dark about the bronzer, this is my first Australian gold product and I will be sticking to designer skin from now on</li>
            <li> It has a really great smell to it and isn&#x27;t too thick or too thin.</li>
            <li> Overall very satisfied, just still very confused on the different bottles!</li>
            <li> I used this for the first time tonight, and I swear some of my blotches from peeling are disappearing after letting the bronzers work for only an hour and a half before showering.  </li>
            <li> I got extremely dark extremely fast, but you have to remember with all the bronzers comes some downfalls.  </li>
            <li> I no longer use this product because of price, I refuse to pay so much for a lotion that delivers the same as other cheaper brands.</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;ve been tanning for several years now and have tried lotions from all the major brands, I&#x27;ve just started tanning for the season and this lotion had made me at least two full shades darker with each use, going only once a week.  </li>
            <li> OMG the bottle is super hard to squeeze out the lotion</li>
            <li> other reviewers said it didn&#x27;t leave that \\&quot;tanning bed smell\\&quot; and 2) I was looking for a lotion to help me get a dark tan quickly.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Although it is a little more in the salon, you will only need half of that product to go a long way.&lt;br /&gt;where</li>
            <li> I bought it due to the reviews that talked so highly of it.</li>
            <li> and it does not help you tan as well as other high end brand tanning lotion do.</li>
            <li> and it didnt get me that much darker, with forever black</li>
            <li> I actually  got half a bottle of Jergen&#x27;s lotion and half a bottle of cheap tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> It did keep my skin feeling soft after tanning instead of dry.</li>
            <li> when I leave salon my skin still feels soft and moisturized, not sticky and dry.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell nearly as well as i thought it would and believe it or not this lotion made me at least 2 shades LIGHTER from the first use.</li>
            <li> I usually tan really well naturally, but who has time out lay out for an hour every day?</li>
            <li> (I am super picky about this common slimy feeling bronzer&#x27;s sometimes tend to leave.)</li>
            <li> The side of my legs were super dark and then the inside of my thighs and shins were not as dark.</li>
            <li> smells good, doesn&#x27;t leave orange(y) brown streaks, and so much less expensive than the salon price.  </li>
            <li> Good item bad shipping</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the way it smells, my skin is crazy soft</li>
            <li> I would recommend the other lotions by Jwoww like natural bronzer and white wedding bronzer</li>
            <li> The tan that this product has helped me achieve is very natural looking, but PLENTY dark.  </li>
            <li> Tanning New Solid Black Bronzer Tanning Bed Lotion, 100x, 13.5-Ounce</li>
            <li> Listen to me when I say I have spent hundreds on lotions, from Designer Skin to Kim K lotions, they do NOT compare to the intense dark color you get from this lotion.</li>
            <li> The only thing I can say is the darkness didn&#x27;t last that long after the tan.</li>
            <li> Stopped using it and tanning for a few weeks bought a different lotion and tanned like normal.</li>
            <li> I have only used this product once so far, and don&#x27;t typically write reviews, but I felt I should.</li>
            <li> I had previously used Conceited tanning lotion, mainly because it smells amazing, so I was worried that buying the jwoww online without trying it could end badly...</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t put much into tanning lotions as I usually go with none or with some from Wal-Mart</li>
            <li> I usually go for very sweet/sexy smelling lotions.</li>
            <li> but it definetly didn&#x27;t make me nearly as tan as JWOWW (not that I&#x27;m looking to be that dark anyway.</li>
            <li> I usually go for lotions by the smell, because I don&#x27;t see much results.  </li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t tan very well</li>
            <li> and i usually tan fairly fast</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really help me get any darker than usual.</li>
            <li> Gets you dark much faster than other tanning lotions I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> And I do like it, however apparently it is not for me</li>
            <li> The round part of the cap did come off of the other part of the cap within the first couple uses for some reason..</li>
            <li> Personally, I need to wash my face well after use, because the moisturizer is a bit much for my skin type, but that is common for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m totally convinced that the lotion was a cheap fake.</li>
            <li> Its a good lotion for when your just starting out tanning and are trying to build your base tan.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my skin soft for a little bit, long enough to tan.</li>
            <li> local tanning salon has limited lotions</li>
            <li> Well, I haven&#x27;t noticed a big enough difference over other lotions for me to get over the scent.</li>
            <li> I got really dark the first week witch with other I would need a month or so to get really dark .</li>
            <li> I was honestly really afraid many people were buying it just for the name on the bottle.</li>
            <li> Ordered it on Monday, got it this morning (Wednesday) went straight to the tanning salon and came out AT LEAST 3 shades darker.</li>
            <li> It left me with a dark, deep tan.</li>
            <li> worked really well, but it left a thin, greasy, residue on my skin, leaving me feeling gross.</li>
            <li> As long as it&#x27;s not over a year</li>
            <li> Complete waste of my money.</li>
            <li> As long as it&#x27;s ever on the market, I will buy it.</li>
            <li> Just started tanning again it&#x27;s been a long time I do notice my color coming out a lot</li>
            <li> I am a year long tanner, so I am always looking for diff lotions.  </li>
            <li> This product is absolutely not the same.  </li>
            <li> This is definitely a good lotion for beginners who need to build a base.    </li>
            <li> After like two uses I had my base tan and it smells good.</li>
            <li> I already have a good base tan.  </li>
            <li> I have been using for about a week now and this has given me a good base color.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really notice difference between this lotion and other I&#x27;ve tried in the past.  </li>
            <li> It was $65 there (seriously) and I purchased the EXACT same lotion on Amazon for less than $20, so PLEASE buy it here and not at your salon</li>
            <li> i didnt smell or feel gross like some of the other ones do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a lotion expert, I&#x27;ve only purchased 3 other lotions besides this one</li>
            <li> It just does same thing any other tanning lotion does.</li>
            <li> I will be using this lotion for a long time!</li>
            <li> and I won&#x27;t be using any other lotion in the future.</li>
            <li> Only downfall was the size wish it was a little bigger!</li>
            <li> and I have noticed a big difference in my tanning due to this product.</li>
            <li> As far as this lotion helping me get dark, it has helped me develop a nice base tan</li>
            <li> Likely due to it&#x27;s expiration date.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t get that burnt skin mixed with tanning lotion smell with this one that you do from a lot of other tanning lotions.  </li>
            <li> Lasted a very long time</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t take long to get a deep dark tan.</li>
            <li> I have used it several times and I have some color when I finish tanning and then after a few hours I have the same tan I had before I went tanning with it.</li>
            <li> I am not happy, it barely works I see hardly no difference</li>
            <li> I probably wouldn&#x27;t use it every single day, but it&#x27;s my \\&quot;I need a tan now emergency\\&quot; lotion.  </li>
            <li> I hear it is limited edition</li>
            <li> Next, the consistency of the lotion was just not right</li>
            <li> But in terms of it actually getting you dark, try something else.</li>
            <li> Currently at a medium dark.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a frequent tanner, I have used snookie tanning lotion in the past</li>
            <li> but I will probably order the Australian Gold Gelee once this one is gone because it&#x27;s not worth the price (which has gone up since I ordered my lotion about a month ago).</li>
            <li> First time I used it, it came out of the bottle really thin and watery.  </li>
            <li> I have been tanning for many years and have used very expensive and in-expensive tanning lotions.  </li>
            <li> Sad but true.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m starting to wonder if it&#x27;s watered down or something.</li>
            <li> and I came to the conclusion since my lotion was a totally different shade of color that it had been watered down to ship out in bulk.</li>
            <li> The smell is tolerable and not too intense when first applying to the skin, but after, oh my, I stink! :(</li>
            <li> I tan about 2-3 times a week and this lotion has lasted me a very long time!</li>
            <li> Did not appear to be the same lotion as what I had previously purchased.</li>
            <li> I work at a tanning salon and recently purchased Jwoww Black Bronzer.</li>
            <li> I bough this lotion from Amazon because it was about half the price of my local tanning salon.  </li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical, like people were only buying the product because some reality show star&#x27;s name was on it, but I decided to try it anyway.</li>
            <li> It smells alright, reminds me of Sinfully Black by Australian Gold.&lt;br /&gt;Results--</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a basic black bronzer.</li>
            <li> , it was sort of chunky and definitely not your typical tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> smell is fine, not super cheesy like some, it works for me.</li>
            <li> received it quickly, but am annoyed it&#x27;s expired!</li>
            <li> I will say that the tan is slow to start but it won&#x27;t make you dark fast.</li>
            <li> i hate drama) and she is really dark and known for tanning,but i decided to give it a shot when the owner said it was really good.</li>
            <li> Also, the shade was not as dark as some of the other reviews had lead me to believe prior to purchase.</li>
            <li> Not sure why anyone would rate it any lower.. maybe they have a different skin type dunno, but don&#x27;t hesitate to give jwoww a try regardless of the silly name on the bottle! :-)  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll bet I&#x27;ll only need to tan once a week with this lotion and stay really dark!</li>
            <li> I Also Noticed That I Got A Little Red, As In Burn.</li>
            <li> i have been using it for just about a month and only see little difference.</li>
            <li> After a few days of little results, I decided I&#x27;d ask my tan care professional about the tanning lotion I had.</li>
            <li> I am wrong about anything I have said above, I really would like to know.</li>
            <li> And the bronzer, eh, not really anything to brag about.</li>
            <li> BUT....along came JWOWW, of all the $$ I&#x27;ve spent through the years on lotions...</li>
            <li> Aweful..did not work big waste of money</li>
            <li> Arrived as expected.</li>
            <li> but I see absolutely no results from this bronzer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m blonde with green eyes</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a total waste.</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T waste your money on any tanning lotion online, unless you order off an actual tanning salon website.</li>
            <li> With this lotion I only have to go tanning few times a wk</li>
            <li> and I am really not achieving that.</li>
            <li> The only problem with ordering it from here, is that it took a year and a half to get to my house!</li>
            <li> I have used Jergens natural glow in the past ,for MUCH less money</li>
            <li> and during that time I have used sooo many lotions such as&lt;br /&gt;Worship me, Tao, Aphrodisiac, Luminary, White 2 Black, Going GAGA, Sinfully Black, Paint it black, Insanely Black-Tingle, Black storm, Pure Harmony, Verture, Berrylicious, Sun Skin Spa, Steamy conffesions, and some others</li>
            <li> No funny orange color either.</li>
            <li> Plus, a little bit goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I usually have this problem with any tanning lotion made by australian gold, but I thought I would give this one a try.  </li>
            <li> Definitely one of my favorites over all of the other bronzers that I have tried in the past.</li>
            <li> You know how you usually want to jump in the shower immediately following the tanning bed?  </li>
            <li> After a month of tanning I see absolutely NO difference in my color!</li>
            <li> Maybe it works for other gals, but not for me...</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t usually use lotion with bronzer because of my fear of being too orange, or not rubbing it in well enough and having darker spots on elbows, knees, etc.</li>
            <li> I only used it a couple of times and I am already darker than I usually get all season.</li>
            <li> the only think it&#x27;s not better than Designer</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t leave skin feeling slimy as with other lotions.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> Luv this product no funny smell and not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling greasy like other lotions can do.</li>
            <li> I received an EMPTY BOX!</li>
            <li> i was skeptical at first to buy through Amazon, but i recommend it for everyone.</li>
            <li> I have used various tanning products in the past and nothing made me want to buy another bottle.</li>
            <li> Not like other tanning lotions, that make you smell burnt.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other bronzers to help tan</li>
            <li> I ordered it immediately and the day I got it in the mail I noticed the smell of it didn&#x27;t smell anything like the same  JWOW bottle of lotion my friend had in the past.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t like other bottles I bought.</li>
            <li> I have used this before and purchased it again after using other lotions that weren&#x27;t satisfactory.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t have a really strong smell, but I leave the tanning bed without having the really bad tanning funk (not to say I don&#x27;t smell at all</li>
            <li> Needless to say I went back to my old bronzer.  </li>
            <li> I feel gross after tanning with this very odd scent!</li>
            <li> and now I look very pale when I am next to her.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel it helps be get as dark a tan as my other bronzers.</li>
            <li> I ordered this package Wednesday night and got it on Saturday morning, I was shocked it came so quick!</li>
            <li> Not real strong.</li>
            <li> not exactly what i was expectiong from a \\&quot;black bronzer\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely light complected, so bad my skin is literally transparent.</li>
            <li> and it help me to get really dark tan....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m already dark but this product makes me even darker.</li>
            <li> I even use a discreet sticker to see how dark I am getting and NOTHING.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my way to being snookie dark</li>
            <li> but when i used the lotion I literally went from tan to dark tan.</li>
            <li> it made my skin really silky, which living in AZ is a difficult feat.  </li>
            <li> If you want a dark tan then you gotta buy this lotion.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make u dark or glow..</li>
            <li> BUT IT DOESN&#x27;T MAKE YOU DARK.</li>
            <li> for the price of this lotion, you absolutely can not go wrong.</li>
            <li> and I have to say it&#x27;s not really worth my money.</li>
            <li> Just dark, burnt-like, matte skin.</li>
            <li> , my tummy is reallly dark</li>
            <li> Just an average tanning lotion.  </li>
            <li> not worth the money</li>
            <li> and I got DARK, nut not orangey.</li>
            <li> and I got really dark.</li>
            <li> I do see color results, but not as dark as what I would like.  </li>
            <li> By the end of the bottle I was really dark.</li>
            <li> I know comment all the time on how dark I am</li>
            <li> , it doesn&#x27;t have that weird \\&quot;tanning\\&quot; smell, and it leaves your skin feeling really silky.</li>
            <li> I like to mix it with my Insanley Dark tingle lotion to get both effects at once.</li>
            <li> Does not provide a dark tan s</li>
            <li> It gives you a dark tan and doesn&#x27;t leave you with orange palms.</li>
            <li> Two weeks later, my tan had faded by at least three shades.</li>
            <li> I however didnt recieve the  dark tan</li>
            <li> dark</li>
            <li> Like Jwoww products but prefer the 50x dark tanning lotion - works quicker and lasts longer.</li>
            <li> after i showered and shaved they still look like i have dark spots or a skin issue.</li>
            <li> Lotion isn&#x27;t too dark and doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling greasy.  </li>
            <li> I wouldnt recommend it to anyone who already has a base tan because your not going to get that much more color from it where it isnt loaded with bronzers.</li>
            <li> but I think it&#x27;s better suited for someone who already has a base tan.</li>
            <li> It also smelled good and didnt leave me feeling all nasty.</li>
            <li> This lotion is more for those that do not yet have a base tan.</li>
            <li> The issue to me is price because I have found other products that work just as well as this lotion but is less then half the price of this bottle.</li>
            <li> but i was let down ;(</li>
            <li> I feel like I got some out of date or watered down defective bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve switched due to the smell!</li>
            <li> I was already dark to begin with from previous tan sessions, but this lotion just enhances my tan.</li>
            <li> if your looking to get dark use forever black</li>
            <li> It Black Auto-darkening Dark Tanning Lotion, 50X, 13.5-Ounce or&lt;br /&gt;Millenium</li>
            <li> this black bronzer dark blew me away.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been tanning every other day for the past month using Pink Cabana with no change in color.</li>
            <li> I have small hands and it does get hard to hold and squeeze some lotion out because it&#x27;s a short but wide bottle.</li>
            <li> I am extremely upset I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed, I&#x27;ve purchased other Austrailian Gold products in the past &amp; have loved them</li>
            <li> Very high quality lotion at a bargain price...don&#x27;t waste your money on the expensive ones...</li>
            <li> I had previously tried a packet of this lotion at my tanning salon</li>
            <li> The subtle bronzers don&#x27;t turn you yellow and the tan lasts for weeks.</li>
            <li> When it says &#x27;dark&#x27; it means &#x27;dark&#x27; not a light tan.  </li>
            <li> Designer Skin Black, Designer Skin Luminary, Designer Skin Queen, Swedish Beauty Amaretto, ones with tingle, ones with bronzers</li>
            <li> JWOWW BLACK BRONZER-Australian Gold  </li>
            <li> Also you still smell like a tanning bed and burnt skin slightly with this lotion, the smell is not anything close to how people described it in the reviews..</li>
            <li> I think they put \\&quot;Black</li>
            <li> ...honestly id spend my money on BLACK by Designer Skin...</li>
            <li> I bought a sample of the JWOWW Black Bronzer</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled by the name \\&quot;Black</li>
            <li> the lotion felt sticky and slightly oily.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not real sure why Amazon is just now asking me to rate it</li>
            <li> As it turns out she said a lot of frauds use the bottle and half the product.  </li>
            <li> Received Frankly Scarlet,Jwoww and black .</li>
            <li> My husband uses the Jwoww Black Bronzer Tanning Lotion.</li>
            <li> less then what the locals were selling them</li>
            <li> It was not even half the price she saw it sold for</li>
            <li> This time for budget purposes, I wanted to find a tanning lotion that was $20 or less and chose to try this one.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not fair skinned by any means, but only a couple times tanning</li>
            <li> The smell prior to tanning is decent, but afterward it kinda bad.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t silicone heavy, which is somewhat of a let down.</li>
            <li> Overall, while I think that the lotion will give me a slight color boost, I&#x27;m not very impressed.</li>
            <li> I am very pale and I tend to not really commit to tanning as I should</li>
            <li> The texture is a little runny.</li>
            <li> 2 people told me i looked dark!</li>
            <li> It was a little watery</li>
            <li> a little seemed to go along way with this.</li>
            <li> But the smell.. a little too flowery for me.</li>
            <li> We have been using this lotion in our salons.. and will no longer carry it.. as we are seeing little to no results..  </li>
            <li> It gave me a dark bronze in just a couple weeks !</li>
            <li> and I was a dark brown color!</li>
            <li> You do have that tanning bed smell for a little while after you get out</li>
            <li> but it makes you DARK!</li>
            <li> and I just started noticing a little tan.</li>
            <li> *if you aren&#x27;t getting dark it&#x27;s because you&#x27;re washing the lotion off TOO SOON!</li>
            <li> I only gave it 4 stars because i think it is a little weak on the bronzing</li>
            <li> I may try something with a little bit darker bronzer</li>
            <li> I was a little discouraged.</li>
            <li> I had laid 4 times and people were already complimenting how dark I was!</li>
            <li> It smells and works poorly, seems identical to one of the cheaper australian gold lotions called sinfully black.</li>
            <li> The only issue I have is the shape of the bottle and how it can be very hard to hold onto when your hands are covered in lotion, so use a towel to hold onto it.</li>
            <li> my legs never get that dark but with this they are definately getting dark!!</li>
            <li> 2 thumbs down!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get very dark with it.</li>
            <li> So my review is don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I tan year round</li>
            <li> Not like it oozes all over or anything.</li>
            <li> I waited a week after I bought this product to review it, because I wanted to use it a few times before coming to a conclusion on how I felt about it.</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money on this one.</li>
            <li> Tried a few samples of this lotion, not a fan.</li>
            <li> Unless u go tanning everyday.</li>
            <li> Bought mine, it was a few days expired</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of lotions in the past and have never been as dark as I am now.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> Could see results after a few days.</li>
            <li> She uses it everyday</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to go tanning everyday and this lotion requires that to keep the color.</li>
            <li> dont waste your money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li> Just purchased this bronzing lotion a few weeks ago.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t take but a few days to get it..</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have been using this lotion for a few years now.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get any darker Nd ended up throwing it out waste of money</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> As far as color, however, I&#x27;m not impressed</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy into the name of this product and waste your money.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been through quite a few lotions.</li>
            <li> Do not let the bottle, Black bronzer, or the product name FOOL YOU!</li>
            <li> she looked up the lotion in her booked and realized I got it 2$ less than her cost!</li>
            <li> Pale skin</li>
            <li> It was really difficult to squeeze out of the bottle for some reason at first, that was frustrating.</li>
            <li> I can not easily tan but with this product I achieve the color I want with in couple of tanning session.</li>
            <li> Bad smell at first.  </li>
            <li> As dark as I am I still use it in the tanning salon for at least 10mins</li>
            <li> The carrier (it was some weird carrier I had never heard of), left it at my neighbors, and they discovered it behind their trash can three weeks later and then gave it to me.  </li>
            <li> Not many tanning lotions can give you a difference in just a few days.</li>
            <li> I am not an avid tanner, I go a little bit before summer to give me a base tan and even out the lines from the previous summer.</li>
            <li> nearly impossible, The shipping was fast though arrived to Kansas in 2 days</li>
            <li> My base tan is pretty dark already</li>
            <li> This product cuts that time in half if not more!</li>
            <li> It goes on a little thick</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t use anything other tanning lotion again!!!</li>
            <li> I burned every time I tanned for 2 weeks straight like bad.</li>
            <li> all in all, waste of money!</li>
            <li> :S)  </li>
            <li> I usually tan a redish/brown color</li>
            <li> I have had a problem with brozers staining my clothes in the past and this has not been a problem with this product.</li>
            <li> The people in my salon kept giving me different suggestions, but they were always so expensive to buy in the shop.  </li>
            <li> Im not sure about this product.</li>
            <li> When I went to the salon, the girl recommended JWOWW, I was a bit skeptical as it was quiet pricy.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money!</li>
            <li> I usually get the one with the energizing Turner in it</li>
            <li> How do you not love this lotion.</li>
            <li> but it has never left streaks on me or looked weird.</li>
            <li> I was not pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel greasy or oily like some lotions I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> no more looking like a lobster.</li>
            <li> so I am not able to compare lotions.</li>
            <li> three times a week, i know not healthy .</li>
            <li> It sucks having to waste money at the salon</li>
            <li> usually everything takes a week plus to receive.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure why.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s solely the lotion</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t overwhelming with a nasty odor!</li>
            <li> so not sure what the problem was.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t like using bronzers</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical after reading mixed reviews here, but I went ahead and ordered the product anyway.</li>
            <li> The most awful thing with the thickness of the lotion.</li>
            <li> and it kinda lathered and foamed up leaving somewhat of a weird white film.</li>
            <li> i got it last yr at the end of tanning to have for this yr so ill</li>
            <li> Not sure if it made a difference on my color,</li>
            <li> I usually use Obsidian for reference.</li>
            <li> I shrugged it off as nothing, &amp; continued tanning as i usually would, using the lotion I had purchased.</li>
            <li> however ... the past couple times I have gone tanning I have started breaking out in what looks like hives...</li>
            <li> I wear a bikini bottom but no top inside the beds (and in the yard).</li>
            <li> Ill buy here next time.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m still pale, I thought bronzer makes u at least bronze</li>
            <li> because the tan didn&#x27;t last long, it made me feel sticky and gross after using it, and to me it smelled nasty.</li>
            <li> Overall, I don&#x27;t hate this lotion enough to return it</li>
            <li> the color it gave me was really minimal to, i could see very subtle results...</li>
            <li> i have very pale skin</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t think I got the real product, very disappointing</li>
            <li> My husband also uses this, and I havnt noticed hardly any difference in his tan.</li>
            <li> My skin is hard to take color and this bronzer was the solution.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to get out of the bottle because of the shape of the bottle.</li>
            <li> hard to get out of the bottle</li>
            <li> But still, Im not giving it a bad review for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Not in the least bit am I a Jersey Shores fan.</li>
            <li> The smell is terrible and reminds me of cheap men&#x27;s cologne.</li>
            <li> , it isn&#x27;t greasy, and there is no after odor (at least not one I notice).  </li>
            <li> I actually left mine out in the car everyday since I go tanning after work and the bad smell went away after about a week.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this lotion late Sunday night after 11pm</li>
            <li> I use it at least five times a week</li>
            <li> so I should have gotten at least a glimpse of color</li>
            <li> It is a thick brown cream.  </li>
            <li> The consistency is also great...not too thick and not too thin...goes on well and soaks in  </li>
            <li> but this lotion really helped me get a base tan</li>
            <li> i was not very happy about how it didnt tan my skin.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you anything about the smell before or after at the time because I&#x27;ve been very sick for almost a week now, and now the only thing really left</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy if your not able to immediately shower after every time!</li>
            <li> Will take you past your tanning plateau too!  </li>
            <li> Only thing wrong is that I&#x27;m breaking out in hives from it!:</li>
            <li> Ill try other lotion in this maker.</li>
            <li> the mean time, I will be looking for another tanning place to go to.</li>
            <li> I had a base tan already and it has only increased my color slightly.</li>
            <li> but it was creamy and the bottle was very difficult to squeeze after the 1st initial squirt.</li>
            <li> , i&#x27;m not a fanatic about it, but i don&#x27;t hate it.</li>
            <li> this lotion is not worth the money it will leave you with a orange color I was not impressed at all with it</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with the JWOWW tanning black bronzer.</li>
            <li> And much, MUCH less expensive than at the salon.</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> the fragrance is subtle not overpowering.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this product still left that weird tanning bed smell</li>
            <li> Definitely less expensive than purchasing at the tanning salon.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a serious product for serious tanners.</li>
            <li> My results though, were a little scary.</li>
            <li> Overall it isn&#x27;t a bad lotion.</li>
            <li> Not a good tanning lotion</li>
            <li> This is not a good quality lotion and if you use it BEWARE.</li>
            <li> and I am hard to tan!</li>
            <li> the after smell is not pleasant whatsoever</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any major \\&quot;holy crap</li>
            <li> As dumb as it sounds</li>
            <li> After one week of using it, I am 2 shades darker, at least!</li>
            <li> Just got this lotion and im extremely disappointed it expired last month</li>
            <li> Once I had received open and used this product I realized that it was due to expire,  was very disappointed!</li>
            <li> This product truly sucks!</li>
            <li> any other lotion i have purchased!!!!!</li>
            <li> Before, I would have to plan my tanning sessions along with my showers to avoid feeling nasty after tanning; with the JWOWW Black Bronzer, I can tan whenever I want and not have to worry about feeling gross after!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be afraid that AG will slap &#x27;Jwoww&#x27; on the bottle and make a crumby product to put in it because that is ABSOLUTELY NOT WHAT THEY DID!!!  </li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t bad, but it isn&#x27;t what I expected.</li>
            <li> I already had a beginning base tan prior to using this lotion, but after one use, I have definitly noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> Not happy.</li>
            <li> I have a base, I&#x27;m not Ghostly white -</li>
            <li> Im alittle confused</li>
            <li> I do like how it&#x27;s a thin lotion</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had worse, but I would only recommend this for someone who is trying to build a base tan, not for someone trying to progress after developing one.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about ordering the tanning lotion online but with the unbelievable prices at my tanning salon (this bottle would&#x27;ve cost me $70!)</li>
            <li> I would even consider tanning then going to do other things after because it doesn&#x27;t smell bad or feel oily.  </li>
            <li> seriously!</li>
            <li> and I seriously owe it to this lotion!</li>
            <li> Jwoww black bronzer smells bad, and I did not see any results after using it.</li>
            <li> If ur dark and want to b darker buy this you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Other products that I have tried would take a whille to even get a base tan and the tan would fade.</li>
            <li> Sorry but this product suuuuucked to be quite frank:( It definately is not worth all of the hype it got or the money.</li>
            <li> My rash was so bad i had to be rushed to the emergency room because it caused me to also have an asthma attack due to the allergic reaction!!!</li>
            <li> but apparently there&#x27;s evil people out there that don&#x27;t care about the quality of a product!</li>
            <li> I am waiting to get my base tan down, so I can move up to the Jwoww 50x Bronzer.</li>
            <li> I go to the tanning salon and as everyone knows there products are SO expensive.</li>
            <li> I get compliments all the time on how I do not look orange or fake.</li>
            <li> but i was skeptic it might be a fake.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell weird</li>
            <li> it left my skin feeling so sticky and nasty</li>
            <li> [so weird].</li>
            <li> but it was too expensive to buy in salons.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s useless to me</li>
            <li> Sorry ladies...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used $100 lotions and JWOW&#x27;s lotion blows the expensive bottles out of the water.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, i won&#x27;t be using JWOWW lotion again.</li>
            <li> Now, don&#x27;t get me wrong -</li>
            <li> It was a fake.</li>
            <li> It wasnt expensive</li>
            <li> Lotions are so expensive at the tanning salons</li>
            <li> I am not impressed at all</li>
            <li> I bought this product hoping for a cheaper alternative to the expensive bronzer I use.  </li>
            <li> but im not happy!</li>
            <li> Totally fake no bronzer at all</li>
            <li> Not happy!</li>
            <li> Beyond that, I was not impressed.</li>
            <li> I was totally skeptical with a reality star tanning lotion</li>
            <li> I believe the lotion I got is fake.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say if def gives no orangy fake bake look.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, the scent of this is not my cup of tea.</li>
            <li> My tanning salon tried to tell me that the products from amozon were fake but as soon as i got it</li>
            <li> You also don&#x27;t end up smelling weird after you get out of the bed.</li>
            <li> but I guess I was wrong</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t buy again sadly</li>
            <li> I have no idea what is wrong with this lotion.</li>
            <li> This product is a fake.</li>
            <li> Ill never buy lotion off the Internet again.</li>
            <li> so this was useless to me.</li>
            <li> Not impressed.</li>
            <li> Not impressed.</li>
            <li> Well after continuous use at the salon i started to notice weird spots on my legs.</li>
            <li> I must have gotten the fake stuff because it did not do ANYTHING.</li>
            <li> this didnt cause any irritation or weird coloring.</li>
            <li> and like I said, this is seriously a STEAL!!</li>
            <li> After reading some negative reviews I was expecting to be disappointed with this lotion.</li>
            <li> I just didn&#x27;t want a fake, orange look; and was really disappointed that i spent like $25 on it :(</li>
            <li> it smells like fruits which is weird because tanning lotion usually smells horrible!</li>
            <li> , Totally unhappy.</li>
            <li> Blocked the hair folicals on my legs which gave me chicken skin,not to mention it did nothing to help my color.</li>
            <li> DEFINITELY FAKE !</li>
            <li> Of course I&#x27;m upset that I believe the item I received is fake, but that is what replies are for!</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S SO FAKE!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with this purchase!</li>
            <li> but after I tan my family says it stinks really bad.  </li>
            <li> Snookie&#x27;s smells bad.  </li>
            <li> The lotion smell isnt bad, it&#x27;s just not working like I thought it would.  </li>
            <li> For those of you reading these reviews, know this...the people giving bad reviews are just hating on JWOW</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how anyone could give this a bad review.  </li>
            <li> (Also, the people who gave this product a bad review must have gotten a bad batch or something</li>
            <li> or it was just a bad batch.</li>
            <li> Like blisters bad.</li>
            <li> It does not have a bad smell-- doesn&#x27;t smell like heaven</li>
            <li> I have always tanned with no issues and as soon as I tried this, I started having a bad reaction.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t greasy afterwards and it didn&#x27;t have a bad after tan smell.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t too bad before or after your tan.</li>
            <li> This lotion works well and doesn&#x27;t smell bad.</li>
            <li> I have never had to write a bad review on a product.</li>
            <li> I told the manager of the tanning place who was shocked.  </li>
            <li> &#x3D;(  </li>
            <li> &gt;&#x3D;(</li>
            <li> This tanning lotion rubs on like a moisturizing lotion, which I like, and it doesn&#x27;t have any disgusting fake tan smell or any greasy texture on the skin after it&#x27;s use.</li>
            <li> , Ill be buying from Amazon rather than the crazy price my salon sells it for!!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried almost ever lotion out there and have been disappointed but this exceeded my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, I was incredibly disappointed when I realized that I have purchased yet another lotion that smells like hair dye.</li>
            <li> Disappointed in the product...</li>
            <li> Boy was that a disappointment!</li>
            <li> so yes im disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I have not been disappointed one bit.</li>
            <li> this is stupid</li>
            <li> I recommend this to people who already have a base tan going on</li>
            <li> May work for someone who does not have a base tan</li>
            <li> I already had a base tan because I had been tanning for about 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> , you can tell someone squeezed some out of it since there was spill over on the cap on the inside, just annoying they can sell expired products on here.</li>
            <li> just crap lotion</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t do crap to improve where I was, will never repurchase</li>
            <li> Need to have a base tan before you&#x27;ll see desired results.</li>
            <li> You have to have a base tan</li>
            <li> Ever!&lt;br /&gt;However, as much as I hate to admit this.</li>
            <li> Takes me forever to get a base tan, used this lotion one time after not tanning for two years and someone told me they could tell I was tanning.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t sealed and I was so disappointed I ended up throwing the crap away!</li>
            <li> I promise you will not be disappointed with this product!</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> ( so now I have to keep searching for another tanning bronzer : ( If it wasn&#x27;t from me breaking out and itching I would buy this all the time!</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see a difference at all in my color and was very disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is crap!! This doesn&#x27;t say Australian Gold any where on the bottle.. It&#x27;s some cheap knock off!! Buyers be ware!! I would give it 0 stars!!</li>
            <li> love that smooth lotion and it help me to get really dark tan....</li>
            <li> Wife loves it so 5stars</li>
            <li> Really excells your tanning prosses.  I got really dark the first week witch with other I would need a month or so to get really dark . It&#x27;s not sticky and smelly like others and I will continue to purchase this product</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion, it has a great fruity smell and it doesn&#x27;t cause that burned skin smell after you get out of the bed. It&#x27;s a great bronzer for me as I only tan for the summer, so I&#x27;m basically a beginner. I gives me a nice color as I am naturally very fair. Probably not something veteran tanners will like, but for someone who builds their tan for the summer, I think its a good choice. But, with an extender and frequent use, I think it would be great for almost everyone.</li>
            <li> I compared this product with the one at my tanning salon and it&#x27;s  NOT the same. The smell and feel is totally different.....</li>
            <li> I loved this lotion. The smell was awesome and it gave a nice bronze look when tanning. Best of all can use it indoors or out! Love all of the jwoww lotions!</li>
            <li> I really like the smell but it breaks my skin out everytime I use it. That is probably just me though.</li>
            <li> My 17yr old loves loves loves it I&#x27;ve used it a time or too and I like it as well smells ok goes on good gives a nice tan</li>
            <li> Pretty good bronzer definitely helped me get the tan I neede before my vacation! The smell&#x27;s good too Great price.</li>
            <li> I meant to order the JWOWW 50xBlack I had use a small pack at the tanning salon and loved it...This was ok but I not to impressed with it...I proably wont buy it again.....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Jwoww&#x27;s, Snookie&#x27;s and Pauly D&#x27;s tanning lotions and Jenny&#x27;s is the best all around.  From fragrance, sheerness, bronzing ability and lasting.  Pauly D&#x27;s is terrible, stained my hands, clothes and everything I touched.  Snookie&#x27;s smells bad.  Jenny&#x27;s smells light and doesn&#x27;t overpower but the that is second to the results.  I was tan after one use and it lasted.</li>
            <li> I go to the tanning salon and as everyone knows there products are SO expensive. I went in one day and they were having a special on this J Woww tanning lotion. They told me it was the best tanning lotion out there. I didn&#x27;t put much into tanning lotions as I usually go with none or with some from Wal-Mart but I did notice the ones at Wal-Mart turned me orange. Anyway, they tell me this lotion is on clearance for 95.00. SERIOULSY???? I WOULD NEVER pay that much for tanning lotion and to think that was the clearance price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I came home and looked on here and found it for so cheap. I have been ordering  it ever sense. It is great and really creates a natural color I get compliments all the time on how I do not look orange or fake. Best part is I showed every one in the salon the price on amazon and they are all ordering it now too!</li>
            <li> I changed up some of my lotions but kept coming back to this one because it worked great protecting my skin while giving the desired glow i wanted.  I liked it the best because it was not greasy and while i was in the bed i never sweated and that was what i needed.  Lasted a very long time and i used it as directed which seemed to improve the color and prelong my tan.</li>
            <li> Okay, I got this in a good time frame. But the problem isn&#x27;t with the delivery, its with the product it self. It smells good. But doesn&#x27;t offer the wow of tan that it claims too. I am vary fair skin, yes. But I do tan and once its developed it looks great. This didn&#x27;t help me achieve that. I only use high power beds or bronzing beds for great benefits of indoor tanning. So my review is don&#x27;t waste your money. Pass. find something else that gets a good review. Id say yes the feel is creamy and soft. Left my skin nice not yucky or needing more moisture. Good smell. No burnt skin or yucky smell as some tanners do with bronzer. And the bronzer, eh, not really anything to brag about. Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> not as good as other jwow lotions ive used. im using one and done now and i like it better.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff!! I will definitely buy again. Works just like it says.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant about buying this just because of the Jwoww name but i&#x27;m so glad I decided to give it a try.  It is a great tanning lotion and smells really nice.  I would definitely recommend this product to others as well as purchase it again for myself.</li>
            <li> Used better lotion, but will work for now</li>
            <li> We learned about this product from a couple we met while vacationing in Jamaica.  They were incredibly dark and had healthy looking skin.  They told us they use this Bronzer religiously on the beach with great results.  We have been using it since.  We always have a healthy dark tan.  Note that this is for tanning beds.  We have only used it outdoors and the results have been been good.</li>
            <li> Awesome :) exactly as I wanted.</li>
            <li> Gives a nice overall bronze color..  Blends in easily.</li>
            <li> This product is so great! Its such a better price than the ones in the salon and it is just as good as the $115 dollar ones! I love it and it has just the right smell! Not too strong! I recommend this lotion!!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Only used it 3 times and already have a nice tan. Doesn&#x27;t stain your clothes, doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling oily and leaves a nice scent. I think I will stick with this one for a while.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several lotions and I even have DS Luminary. This lotion is far better than the most expensive products. I love it. I&#x27;m already dark but this product makes me even darker. Love it. No funny orange color either. It smells wonderful, even though i&#x27;d like it better if it smelled like warm vanillia sugar but it still smells wonderful. Don&#x27;t waste your money on more expensive products when i believe this product is better than them. And i&#x27;ve used and sampled them all. LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> This bronzer? is not doing anything. I have used it for a week now and I don&#x27;t see much if any difference. I have used Jergens natural glow in the past ,for MUCH less money and it works better. This is a no for me.</li>
            <li> I usually use a tingle and decided to try JWOWW because I had heard good things about.  This lotion is awesome.  I have been able to only tan once a week and have amazing dark color.  I will never go back to a tingle after using this lotion.  Give it a try :)</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with the JWOWW tanning black bronzer. It smells SO GOOD and keeps you smelling that good for the rest of the day, even after your tanning session! Its light, so it doesnt feel sticky or caked on or anything. The Amazon price is much cheaper than in-stores and it is SO worth it. It doesnt leave any streaky marks on your skin or on your hands or anything either. Definitely makes a difference in your tanning experience. Plus, a little bit goes a long way! safe to use on your face as well.</li>
            <li> I have not seen a change in my tan since I started using this product. It also smells sort of like cotton candy.. Gives me a headache.</li>
            <li> I received the bottle of JWOW earlier this week bc the price was really good, compared to the salon price.  First time I used it, it came out of the bottle really thin and watery.  I have used it a couple of times and have not noticed any difference at all.  I even use a discreet sticker to see how dark I am getting and NOTHING.  I am olive complected and tan very easily and I use the bronzing beds. I dont understand bc I read the reviews and everyone seemed happy, but I am not.&lt;br /&gt;I wont be buying this again.</li>
            <li> Before I review this product I&#x27;d like to say that the customer service from Glamour Tanning was great. My products arrived well sealed in a timely manner. I will purchase more items from this seller in the future.  Now on to the lotion: I am a loyal Designer Skin fan but I decided to give Jwoww a try after hearing so many recommendations from the girls at the tanning salon. Of course I would never pay full price for anything there. This lotion is nothing special. I&#x27;m guessing all the hype is from the celebrity endorsement. The texture is a little runny. My base tan is pretty dark already so I wasn&#x27;t expecting to see any major contrast in color from the lotion alone. The smell is probably what I dislike the most about this lotion. It smells like a powdery version of B&amp;BW Sun Ripened Raspberry, and not in a good way. Overall, I don&#x27;t hate this lotion enough to return it but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again. There are much better choices available for the same price.</li>
            <li> I purchased this at my tanning salon, which I don&#x27;t go to anymore but that&#x27;s besides the point. It works great! its just amazing. and the smell is wonderful! Like a really really good perfume. I found myself just wearing it day to day because of the GREAT SCENT!</li>
            <li> unsealed bottle.  Did not appear to be the same lotion as what I had previously purchased.</li>
            <li> Am i the only one that has noticed the bottle my salon sells says \\&quot;50X bronzers\\&quot; in the middle and the bottle from Amazon doesn&#x27;t mention it at all? I&#x27;ve looked it up to see if it was a knock off or to see if maybe the bottle just changed and i can&#x27;t find any answers! Ive only used it once but i was skeptic it might be a fake. I did get a noticeable tan, as soon as i got home 2 people told me i looked dark! It was a little watery but it didn&#x27;t leave me sticky at all so i am not complaining! Overall very satisfied, just still very confused on the different bottles! Help?</li>
            <li> Good &amp; fast tanning achieved. Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;I use it whenever I wanted a good rich tan especially a few workout. It gives you the body &amp; muscle&lt;br /&gt;definition.</li>
            <li> As dumb as it sounds i figured if they promoted this lotion that it would be amazing since they are soo tan. Its not the greatest. The lotion is on the liquidy side and doesnt have as much moisture to it.  The scent is okay . Its a good lotion for when your just starting out tanning and are trying to build your base tan.  I wouldnt recommend it to anyone who already has a base tan because your not going to get that much more color from it where it isnt loaded with bronzers.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed the product to a certain point.It got me tan &amp; bronze but it was creamy and the bottle was very difficult to squeeze after the 1st initial squirt.The scent wss ok... I probably would not buy this again</li>
            <li> I read great reviews on JWOWW. I bought it and love it! I a fair skinned and I am really getting a nice tan using the lotion!</li>
            <li> This was my first bronzer besides tinglers. I am glad I switched. I am fair skin and a ginger at that so I know I cannot tan in the sun. But with this jwoww tanning lotion I have achieved the look I always wanted and feel confident with myself. I would also recommend the LIV. That&#x27;s a whole another topic. Best lotion on the market.The jwoww lotion has pleasant smell does not stain you clothes and does not turn you orange. After I tan I don&#x27;t go home and immediatley shower I give it time to finish working its magic.  I would say this a good lotion for an intermediate tanner( level 2).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love me</li>
            <li> I had previously tried a packet of this lotion at my tanning salon and I loved it so I decided to get a bottle of it. I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s the best lotion I&#x27;ve ever used but I would def say it&#x27;s in my top ten. I love this lotion because it makes you look darker after just one use but does not turn you orange at all. I have had problems with other lotions turning me orange if I used them more than one time in a row, but I don&#x27;t have that problem with the jwoww. It gives you a nice bronze look and it smells nice too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received it in the mail about a week after ordering it.</li>
            <li> It was okay. Not like described.. I didn&#x27;t get an instant tan. I actually got a better tab from one of the samples packaged with it! I imagine the JWOWW 50x bronzer would work better..But other than that I enjoyed buying from this saler! It arrived spot on! No troubles at all!</li>
            <li> This product works good and has a great smell to it. It leaves my skin nice &amp; soft after I use it &amp; gives me a nice color.</li>
            <li> i love this item. i will buy again. used many different ones and this ones has no tingle and gives a nice glow and also has a great smell.</li>
            <li> my favorite tanning oil!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS TANNING LOTION ITS ALL I USE NOW</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a problem with any tanning lotion but this one just isn&#x27;t for me. I got it in the mail and the packaging was great and fast shipping. The smell was like any tanning lotion to me. Honestly i think they all stink after I tan. Anyways so I got the lotion and went to tan. It went on good and it was thick a little seemed to go along way with this. That made me happy. Something in it just didn&#x27;t agree with me. An hour after I tanned I broke out in hives all over my chest. It was very itchy and red. It looked like shingles. The next morning it was gone and I figured I&#x27;d try it one more time. It did it again but this time it lasted for days. It was very itchy and it hurt. I&#x27;ve never had a tanning lotion do this to me. It could be something in it idk. It doesn&#x27;t smell weird and I had someone else try it out and it didn&#x27;t do anything to them. Could just be my skin but I just never had this problem with anything.</li>
            <li> Was very happy with the price of this lotion. Salons sell it for $70+!&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t been using lotion , but because of my upcoming vacation decided to give it a try. It takes my tan to the next level, and even my boyfriend noticed my darker color after the first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend !</li>
            <li> I love this, i recently bought it from the tanning salon but will be ordering through amazon because its half the price. The first time i used it I fell in love with them smell and wheni got out of the tanning bed i didnt smell or feel gross like some of the other ones do. It worked the first time i used it! I realllly like it! I tan year round but was tanning more for a trip and this helped speed the process.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth, I&#x27;m not real happy with the smell but it does the job</li>
            <li> It took me a while to finally get a hold of JWoww&#x27;s lotion &amp; I&#x27;m so glad I finally did! The lotion is amazing after 2 days in a regular tanning bed using this lotion I received so many compliments! Once I&#x27;m out I will definitely be ordering another bottle &amp; I&#x27;m also telling people it&#x27;s a must try for them!</li>
            <li> I got to be honest.. its nothing special. For one, it took 5 weeks to get. I live in Canada, so that was probably why it took so long. But the smell.. a little too flowery for me. And the results? Nothing to call home about. It does the job, but nothing too special&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m also not in love with the way it goes on. I love creams that go on smooth, thick and creamy. This lotion is kind of watery? Not like it oozes all over or anything. Its just not as creamy and moisterizing as I&#x27;d like. At the end of the day, its a celebrity endorsed product. If you&#x27;re a fan of J-woww, then you&#x27;ll probably like this lotion. But its nothing great!</li>
            <li> This lotion smells really good before and after tanning, and leaves your skin extremely smooth.  The only thing was that I would have some color after tanning, then wake up the next morning and be light again. No I did not shower after tanning.  My skin just couldn&#x27;t hold the tan from this lotion.  I usually have this problem with any tanning lotion made by australian gold, but I thought I would give this one a try.  I still recommend it to tanners out there, but if you have the fading problem like me, I would try something by Designer Skin.</li>
            <li> It smelled nice and rubbed in great, I think I could have gotten darker but It might just be my skin-tone. I was happy with this product.</li>
            <li> After reading some negative reviews I was expecting to be disappointed with this lotion. But I actually like it quite a bit. It has a nice smell, which is important, and seems to have pretty good results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion because there were a ton of positive reviews, but i was very disapointed! The smell was not bad, but it wasnt good either and it sure didnt last long. the texture was not as creamy as i was hoping for, it was almost more goopy and it didnt sink in at all. it left my skin feeling so sticky and nasty, i felt like i hadnt showered in weeks after applying it. the color it gave me was really minimal to, i could see very subtle results... not exactly what i was expectiong from a \\&quot;black bronzer\\&quot;. not to mention it came 2 weeks after the eta! this lotion is awful i really dont like to waste but i really dont want to put this stuff on my skin again either. all in all, waste of money!</li>
            <li> Good seller, good product. Worked well in tanning bed for deeper bronze color. Nice smell, not greasy or sticky.  Good price.</li>
            <li> this lotion not only helps hydrate so i got a much better tan it also smells so good! no burnt skin smell! totally worth the purchase!</li>
            <li> I used this for the first time today and I am already noticing a difference!! I def. look darker and I only went in for 15 mins! I also love the smell! Great job JWOWW!!!</li>
            <li> I tried this after reading a review, and just as the person stated, it smelled good and gave a nice dark tan! Love it!</li>
            <li> This was my first bronzer and I went right through it. It&#x27;s a thinner lotion with a kind of weird light smell that kind of freshens after you tan [so weird]. This got me brown but I think it&#x27;s better suited for someone who already has a base tan. It leaves my skin soft for a little bit, long enough to tan. I go through a lot though because it&#x27;s so thin, it kind of soaks into the skin too fast. I really love it though.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that I care for the scent while putting it on. (It&#x27;s sort of an old woman smell.) The smell does go away after tanning though. The first couple times I used it, I did notice getting darker. I don&#x27;t know if I have reached my plataeu or what, but now it seems like I am getting lighter when I use this lotion. Like I&#x27;ve said.. I&#x27;ve had worse, but I would only recommend this for someone who is trying to build a base tan, not for someone trying to progress after developing one.</li>
            <li> I have been using \\&quot;jwoww\\&quot; for a couple weeks now.  I have tried many of the more expensive lotions and found this one to work just as well.  the thing i like about it the most, the smell.  I cant go into work smelling like i just went tanning (and most lotions make you stink :S)  it was very light and non-greasy, i have been tanning for years, and it actually increased my tan (which is hard for me) plus the smell is great. it says berry scent, but honestly i cant really smell that. regardless, its a great lotion :) would recommend</li>
            <li> This is the best bronzer i have used. Just be careful to rub it in very good after tanning so you dont streak.</li>
            <li> I just used this lotion earlier today and I really like the feel of it on my skin; it&#x27;s not greasy at all like some of the others. And I also love how this lotion smells...I can actually tan on my lunch break and the scent isn&#x27;t too overpowerinig in the office when I come back to work. Definitely one of my favorites over all of the other bronzers that I have tried in the past.</li>
            <li> This product smells great and gives a great tan. The subtle bronzers don&#x27;t turn you yellow and the tan lasts for weeks.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed about this lotion is that it smells and feels quite similar to a cheaper Designer Skin lotion I used to get at my local beauty supply. Don&#x27;t remember the name but I liked it. That being said, it definitely got me darker than my California Tan. It&#x27;s the perfect consistency and smells nice without being overpowering. I&#x27;ll wait until the bottle is gone to decide if the \\&quot;black bronzer\\&quot; is worth it or not, but for now, I&#x27;m going to say it&#x27;s totally worth the 20 bucks you pay online.</li>
            <li> I had an issue with this product being delivered.  The carrier (it was some weird carrier I had never heard of), left it at my neighbors, and they discovered it behind their trash can three weeks later and then gave it to me.  About the actual product, it&#x27;s pretty good.  Better than it a lot of the tanning lotions I&#x27;ve tried.  It smells nice, seems to speed up the tanning process, and has a bronzing effect.  My only reason for not being super excited about this product, is that my European Gold lotion from Walmart (about $8) just works better (it&#x27;s the best stuff I&#x27;ve ever tried, including the super pricey ones from my tanning salon).  I&#x27;ve decided to stop tanning and go the sunless route, but otherwise I would continue to use this lotion as a backup for the European Gold.</li>
            <li> Absolutley LOVE this lotion! bought it once for $50+ at tanning salon, then found it here for half the price, cant get enough of it, no tingling or burning, no greasy feel, smells AMAZING before and after you tan, and lasts longer than the thicker tanning lotions that are out there, you dont have to use nearly as much. and it came very fast. I&#x27;ve had hundreds of compliments on my color, doesnt turn you orange AT ALL! i recommend it to all my friends and family! Will def be using again.</li>
            <li> Love love love this lotion!!! I was skeptical about ordering this online and just the possibility it may not be authentic, but it is. I&#x27;ve tanned twice now and I tan pretty easily, but I already have a great base tan bc of this lotion</li>
            <li> I really love this product! It is a bronzer but it doesn&#x27;t leave streaks or gives you an unnatural color. The smell is great as well! I would recommend buying this product on amazon because at the tanning salon I go to it&#x27;s like $65!! You&#x27;ll save so much money and mine arrived in just 2 days! What&#x27;re you waiting for??</li>
            <li> I love this it smells great and works even better !!! I&#x27;m on my way to being snookie dark lol</li>
            <li> I honestly wasn&#x27;t expecting that much from this lotion but my tan turned out very nice. I saw a difference the first time I used it. It didn&#x27;t take long to get a deep dark tan. The reason I gave it three stars is because the tan didn&#x27;t last long, it made me feel sticky and gross after using it, and to me it smelled nasty. I do care about the smell because I often have to make a stop after tanning and I don&#x27;t want to smell horrible. I&#x27;ve never had these issues with Designer Skin. Although I did love the tan I got, I wont be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> I waited a week after I bought this product to review it, because I wanted to use it a few times before coming to a conclusion on how I felt about it. First of all, The smell of this isn&#x27;t personally one that I like very much, but it&#x27;s not disgusting. I usually go for very sweet/sexy smelling lotions. This one is not so much sweet, it just smells like old tanning lotion to me. But I do know people like the smell, so I guess it&#x27;s just a \\&quot;personal taste\\&quot; kind of thing. I like the feel of the lotion on my skin, and it doesn&#x27;t make me oily at all afterwards, so that&#x27;s definitely a plus. I do feel like I smell very strongly like the lotion after I&#x27;m finished, though, which I don&#x27;t really like. The first couple of times I used it, I didn&#x27;t apply too much lotion, and still got decent amount of color. The last two times I went, I used A LOT of lotion and noticed that I got SUPER dark! My skin is fair, I guess you could say, in the winter I am quite pale, but in summer I do tan nicely (I&#x27;m Sicilian)! So basically this lotion is worth the buy. I&#x27;m not a lotion expert, I&#x27;ve only purchased 3 other lotions besides this one (so I might not be the most reliable source), but I have to say this one probably gives me the best color. (Do keep in mind, this was a $20 product, and that&#x27;s all I would ever spend on a lotion, but I&#x27;m sure the more expensive ones would be much better if you&#x27;re willing to pay, but this one is great for the price.)</li>
            <li> After reading numerous reviews on this product, I decided to go ahead and get it. Not only was it WAY cheaper on Amazon, but the reviews turned out to be true. It doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling sticky or with that after tanning smell. It makes my skin smooth and I saw a difference after the first session! Would buy again :)</li>
            <li> I have been tanning for years, so I have tried almost everything on the market.  I could care less about the name of the lotion, but I LOVE the fact that it works.  To be honest, I didn&#x27;t even know who J Wow was when I bought it.  I burn fairly easily and it&#x27;s hard for me to get tan sometimes, but this lotion does the trick.  If I want to get tan quick, I use this lotion.  It can get pretty dark though so be careful.  I probably wouldn&#x27;t use it every single day, but it&#x27;s my \\&quot;I need a tan now emergency\\&quot; lotion.  I think the most I have used it is twice in one week because it lasts for quite a while.  When it says &#x27;dark&#x27; it means &#x27;dark&#x27; not a light tan.  Also, I have sensitive skin and I am allergic to some lotions but I don&#x27;t have a problem with this one.  Oh, and I like that there are no orange streaks or anything like that.  I can put it on real quick and not worry about missing a spot.  It doesn&#x27;t hurt that it smells nice too unlike other lotions.  I HIGHLY recommend this lotion to all tanners, beginner to professional.</li>
            <li> We have been using this lotion in our salons.. and will no longer carry it.. as we are seeing little to no results..  It as if Australian Gold whipped together an old lotion and bottled it.. nothing special.. decent smell.. It should be priced at $7.99</li>
            <li> My daughter bought this at \\&quot;A place to tan\\&quot; it&#x27;s a salon where we live...well...i snuck &amp; used it!! it&#x27;s amazing!! I&#x27;m very fair skinned &amp; my legs never get that dark but with this they are definately getting dark!! she even accused me of using her stuff &amp; i had to fess up;)this is definately good stuff!!</li>
            <li> LOVE this product. It has a pleadsnt smell to boot. I shall be buying this product from now on. Thanks amazon and JWOWW</li>
            <li> I recently started using this lotion and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. Not only does it have a pleasant smell, but it also works wonderfully. I was already dark to begin with from previous tan sessions, but this lotion just enhances my tan. The first bottle I ordered through Amazon and will continue to order it through Amazon - there&#x27;s no point in paying $60-$75 for it at the salon, when I can save money ordering it through Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this lotion and not because it has JWoWW&#x27;s name on it, but because it is a good quality lotion.</li>
            <li> This product is ok....it didn&#x27;t give me the tan that the bottle said it would but it for sure smells good.</li>
            <li> Works great. And much, MUCH less expensive than at the salon. Goes on smoothly. Brings out nice tone on my skin.</li>
            <li> This Jwoww Bronzer is amazing I got it last week. I started tanning two weeks ago and had already started to get color but when i used the lotion I literally went from tan to dark tan. It works great and the smell is amazing it leaves your skin soft and not sticky like other lotions would. Im going to buy this item again!!!!</li>
            <li> So I have tried alot of different lotions over the years, and have yet to be impressed. First off I have fair skin and freckles but I tan real well for some reason. I used this mostly outdoors, but my tan was sooooo amazing everyone was impressed, especially me! I&#x27;m sold!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.  You know how you usually want to jump in the shower immediately following the tanning bed?  This stuff is so not gross on your skin..I actually didn&#x27;t want to wash it off..it made my skin really silky, which living in AZ is a difficult feat.  And the smell is great.</li>
            <li> The JWOWW Black Bronzer is awesome! Not only does it smell great, but it doesn&#x27;t leave your skin slimy. (I am super picky about this common slimy feeling bronzer&#x27;s sometimes tend to leave.) The bronzer I was using before, \\&quot;Smile! You&#x27;re Dark,\\&quot; by Designer Skin worked really well, but it left a thin, greasy, residue on my skin, leaving me feeling gross. Before, I would have to plan my tanning sessions along with my showers to avoid feeling nasty after tanning; with the JWOWW Black Bronzer, I can tan whenever I want and not have to worry about feeling gross after! Also, the JWOWW bronzer was priced at $55 at the salon I go to, thanks to Amazon.com, I scored this great product at half the cost. : )</li>
            <li> I bought this last week after hearing lots of great reviews. I bought this tanning lotion so I wouldn&#x27;t have to go tanning as much to mantain a gorgeous tan. I only have to go twice a week now instead of six considering how great the bronzer in this tanning lotion works. I will be buying this again very soon!</li>
            <li> I really thought this woud be a great lotion, but I was very wrong. Its from Australian Gold and the whole \\&quot;Jersey Shore\\&quot; thing is about being tan so how could it not be great, right? This lotion did nothing for me and I tan very easily. I have used countless lotions from over $100 to $10 lotion, and this one I would honestly say is in the bottom 10%. I didnt notice any effect of the bronzer either. Dont waste your money on this one.</li>
            <li> I was amazed at how fast this made it to my front door!!! Earlier that day my daughter had just asked when her just have to have tanning bronzer would be here. I told her that i ordered it monday and it should hopefully be here by friday.  We then went to the movies and we returned in amazement to find a package. Opened it and BAM, there was the JWOWW lotion!!! WOWW!!!</li>
            <li> After a month of tanning I see absolutely NO difference in my color! If anything it&#x27;s keeping away my tan! Many rave about the smell but it really IS TERRIBLE and I want to wash it off every time I use it. The bottle is different in the salons than on here. O well on to the next!</li>
            <li> Purchased this bronzer about a month ago and am so far happy with it.  Nice scent, not greasy feeling, and provides a nice color if used consistently.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to try this tanning lotion but it was too expensive to buy in salons. I thought the price for this was reasonable and this package arrived in 2 business days. I am very pleased and the smell is amazing!! i would definetly reccomend using this tanning lotion!</li>
            <li> This product really deepened my tan and quickly, too. No after tanning smell.</li>
            <li> I tan farely easy without burning.  I used this the first day of tanning this season, and in the one day, I have seen results.  Lotion smells good, I didn&#x27;t leave smelling like I had just tanned which is truly important to me.  Recommend highly! :)</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best!  Gets me dark every year :)</li>
            <li> I was really excited to try Jwow, because i hear a lot about it. I found this cheaper version, and thought it was the real stuff, but i gotta say i don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the real jwow because it gave me orange streaks on my legs...thankfully it rubbed off and washed off in the shower, but have stopped using it. Maybe it works for other gals, but not for me...I just didn&#x27;t want a fake, orange look; and was really disappointed that i spent like $25 on it :(</li>
            <li> Very good ! Very happy !</li>
            <li> I like that this lotion doesn&#x27;t make me smell like burned skin when I am done tanning, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s very moisterizing.  I like the color it gives me.  I just have to moisterize really well after tanning, but I do that anyway, so it&#x27;s no difference to me.</li>
            <li> its ok but if your looking to get dark use forever black it works so much better, year jwoww smell is great but it doesnt get you darker and i used the whole bottle and it didnt get me that much darker, with forever black i was darker in one session!!!!!!! i was so excited to try jwoww seeing as im a big fan of jersey shore but i was let down ;(</li>
            <li> I misunderstood the ad.  It was my belief that it was a sunless tanning product.  It&#x27;s useless to me but \\&quot;my bad\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Tanning Salons sell this lotion for over 60$ I definitely got a good deal on it. Smells amazing, and really works for people with fair skin, without leaving you red, or funny colored from the bronzer in the lotion.</li>
            <li> This Jwoww Black Bronzer is a very nice tanning lotion.  Helps hydrate the skin.  I have notice much quicker results using this lotion compared to others.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It smells so good and it is a heck of a lot cheaper on amazon than at the tanning salon! :) Enjoy!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion- it doesn&#x27;t have very many bronzers, which is a bit of a down side, but it smells absolutely fantastic and works great!</li>
            <li> I like this bronzer but don;t love it. It does produce a faster tan then not using any bronzer obviously but it definetly didn&#x27;t make me nearly as tan as JWOWW (not that I&#x27;m looking to be that dark anyway. Now I use a tanning lotion from Sally&#x27;s, it&#x27;s less than $10 and works much better (quicker/darker results).    [...]</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! It glides on smoothly, has a pleasant scent and doesn&#x27;t feel at all greasy. It also doesn&#x27;t produce that tingling, burning sensation that I&#x27;ve experienced with other lotions, depending on their brand. That was an important factor to me, as I am very fair complected and irritate easily. I already had a beginning base tan prior to using this lotion, but after one use, I have definitly noticed a difference. Not in the least bit am I a Jersey Shores fan. Have never even sat through an episode. But the product stands alone in excellence.</li>
            <li> It tan me very wellI was pleased with this product I would recommend this product to other people who want to tan thanks</li>
            <li> LOVE it had made me so dark and the shimmer it gives is so pretty! I would buy this again!</li>
            <li> I have only used this product once so far, and don&#x27;t typically write reviews, but I felt I should. I have been tanning for several years and have used various lotions. That being said, many promised that they smelled great and didn&#x27;t leave you smelling like that icky tanning bed smell. This one actually delivers. I can&#x27;t really smell that smell at all, it smells more like a perfumed body lotion, and I actually enjoy the smell. It works well too. It definitely enhanced my tan!</li>
            <li> I order this product and after having to anxiously wait for 2 1/2 weeks to arrive, I am glad I order it. I have only used the product once, and I can already see a difference in my tan. I read reviews before I purchased and a lot of people stated it smells amazing. True it does smell good, but it wears off after you get out of the tanning bed. BUT, I did not have a I just tanned smell to my skin. It has some good moisturizers in it and my skins feels very smooth. Love the product. I am waiting to get my base tan down, so I can move up to the Jwoww 50x Bronzer.</li>
            <li> I am a tanaholic.  I usually go for lotions by the smell, because I don&#x27;t see much results.  I&#x27;ve always basically thought it was just an illusion.  BUT....along came JWOWW, of all the $$ I&#x27;ve spent through the years on lotions...I will never look any further than here !  This lotion is WONDERFUL, I absolutely love it, and will continue to use !  And the price in the tanning salon for this lotion , is natually 2x the price that I can get it on amazon.  I recomend this lotion !!!  5 stars all the way , and be wise, and buy from amazon, unless you don&#x27;t mind paying $50 for it :O !</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS LOTION, ITS WHAT&#x27;S I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE AND THE SMELLS, I JUST LOVE IT!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion to tan indoors and it works great! It tans me fast and it smells good too!</li>
            <li> Loved the smell, you don&#x27;t smell burnt after you get out.. it was a very smooth lotion, not to thick and not sticky at all.&lt;br /&gt;I already had a great tan and it did excellarate me.  No orange tint and it did well blending..overall I&#x27;m satisfied</li>
            <li> Tried a few samples of this lotion, not a fan. Pretty pricey when purchased at a tanning salon, and doesn&#x27;t fit the definition of a \\&quot;black bronzer\\&quot;. Smells decent, isn&#x27;t greasy, and soaks right into skin. I&#x27;ll give it a few more tries until I call it quits with JWOWW.</li>
            <li> I own my own tanning bed and have been tanning for years. This lotion is amazing. It smells great (before AND after tanning). It helps you achieve a nice deep tan that looks GREAT!! I have tried most of the lotions sold on amazon that are around the same price and this one is DEFINATELY the best!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. I have tried numerous tanning lotions: Designer Skin Black, Designer Skin Luminary, Designer Skin Queen, Swedish Beauty Amaretto, ones with tingle, ones with bronzers -you get my point. &#x3D;) None have given me immediate results like this! I was skeptical only because of the JWOWW endorsement, but after using it I know that I will by this again, and I have never bought a tanning lotion more than once! It smells great, the bronzers turn you brown (not orange), and the end result is great color, and fast. Enjoy!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been indoor tanning for many years and I&#x27;ve used just about every tanning product on the market. I have to say that JWOWW is by far the best indoor product I&#x27;ve EVER used! It smells great and the best part is that it&#x27;s not thick like other lotions I&#x27;ve used. I would highly recommend this product. I&#x27;ve only used it 3 times thus far and I can tell a big difference in the darkness of my tan. I will never use another product again. A++++++++++++ If you want a dark tan then you gotta buy this lotion.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion.  It holds my tan and I love the smell.  It was worth the cost.  I used it while on the beach and my tan was amazing!  I did not burn at all.  I can&#x27;t wait to buy more.  I would suggest this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Not happy. I&#x27;m not too sure of what this tanning lotion does other than make my skin soft and bronze me for about a day... I&#x27;ve used tanning lotions with bronzers before and I&#x27;ve had way better results; I don&#x27;t really see any darker results with this one. The bronzer does not last more than 1 shower afterl that&#x27;s not really the way bronzer should work. The lotion smells ok, not amazing.</li>
            <li> I used this for the first time tonight, and I swear some of my blotches from peeling are disappearing after letting the bronzers work for only an hour and a half before showering.  On top of that, the lotion consistency was a lot like Sinfully Black in that it was more liquid than most lotions, but not in a bad way, more like it spreads further because of its viscosity.  I can&#x27;t tell you anything about the smell before or after at the time because I&#x27;ve been very sick for almost a week now, and now the only thing really left is major congestion...so no sense of smell.  &#x3D;(  Considering it is an Australian Gold lotion, however, it probably smells wonderful and would bring me a nostalgic feeling of Florida like most tanning lotions (I spent most of my teen years in Florida, and then moved away to my undying chagrin.)  I would definitely recommend this to others, and I really hope the price stays under $23.  Much higher than that, and I might as well shell out some extra dough for Luminary or Obsidian by Designer Skin. &gt;&#x3D;(</li>
            <li> Got it for the wife. It helps her get darker better than other products which she loves. Also smells great. thanks homies</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make u dark or glow.. Unless u go tanning everyday. It just does same thing any other tanning lotion does.</li>
            <li> i really love this it smells AMAZING and doesnt make u yellow or have a funny look at all it also doesnt make u really really dark so it looks natural and a great price</li>
            <li> Well first of all, I gave it 2 stars only because it smells pretty good. I had an allergic reaction to this lotion. Iv never had a reaction to any lotion. But still, Im not giving it a bad review for my sensitive skin. My husband also uses this, and I havnt noticed hardly any difference in his tan. He tans much easier than I do. Product is cheap to buy on amazon, but still not worth the money! For a get quick tanning lotion, Id go with Swedish Beauty Pink Diamond.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. I alternate between this one and another lotion when I tan, but always feel darker after using this lotion. Strong flower like fragrances give me migraines, so I loved the smell of this lotion. Sweet, but in no way floral. I tan about 2-3 times a week and this lotion has lasted me a very long time! Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I got this cause lets face it i love JWWOW. I am getting married in a month and need to get rid of my white white skin. The smell is amazing and the first use of it came with good results i will be totally ready for my outdoor wedding and looking tan. Again smells so much better then any other lotion i have purchased!!!!!</li>
            <li> I am an avid tanner.  This stuff is wonderful.  Well worth the price.  This is my 2nd year in a row using this product.  HIGHLY recommend it.</li>
            <li> THIS LOTION WAS RATED SO GREAT FOR MAKING YOU DARK. BUT IT DOESN&#x27;T MAKE YOU DARK. IVE HAD BETTER. THIS LOTION IS NOT AS GREAT AS EVERYONE SAYS. PROBABLY WON&#x27;T BUY  AGAIN.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t usually use lotion with bronzer because of my fear of being too orange, or not rubbing it in well enough and having darker spots on elbows, knees, etc. this jwoww lotion is wonderful. no orange color and no discolored spots. just a nice even natural looking tan that you can honestly see immediately after stepping out of the tanning salon. for the price of this lotion, you absolutely can not go wrong. doesn&#x27;t make you smell like you just tanned either. this is my new standby bronzer lotion.</li>
            <li> I received this item quick, and used it right away. It has a really nice smell, and has made me really dark brown:)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why people are raving about this lotion. I work for a salon and I won&#x27;t even use it for free let alone pay for it. The smell is terrible and reminds me of cheap men&#x27;s cologne. None of my customers or coworkers who use it regularly get any results from it. There are a million lotions in this price range that work and smell much better.</li>
            <li> When I first got this I knew it would be good..&lt;br /&gt;but this is the closest to heaven that I&#x27;ve ever been and trust me you will fall in love with the scent&lt;br /&gt;The tan looks great and the cream it&#x27;s deelicious .i love this product&lt;br /&gt;Everyone looking for a good tan with the smell of heaven&lt;br /&gt;Get yours now</li>
            <li> Love this bronzer! It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all and really works as it should. Great price and good size bottle too.</li>
            <li> Product came on time and was wrapped up extra secure. I&#x27;ve only got to use it once so far but in that one use I could tell I loved it! It goes on a little thick so it doesn&#x27;t take much and the color you get is amazing! I could tell a huge difference as soon as I stepped out of the bed!</li>
            <li> As somewhat of a tanning lotion connoisseur, I needed to try this tanning lotion after seeing it at my high-end tanning salon. It was $65 there (seriously) and I purchased the EXACT same lotion on Amazon for less than $20, so PLEASE buy it here and not at your salon that will mark it WAY up.   PROS:  -The scent is definitely NOT berry, though I find it is light, pleasant and non-threatening. The best part of this lotion is that you do NOT at all get the \\&quot;after tanning smell\\&quot;, which is wonderful.  -It moisturizes adequately  -It is not greasy at all  -Dries quickly  CONS:  -Don&#x27;t expect it to bronze you overnight, as it doesn&#x27;t really do much of it.  -It has a somewhat unusual consistency. It isn&#x27;t silicone heavy, which is somewhat of a let down. (Silicones make tanning lotions REALLY moisturize and keeps your skin looking great)  -I didn&#x27;t feel like I was getting exceptionally more tan after using it, HOWEVER, my skin looked and felt better and much more healthy/moisturized.  Overall, I would definitely recommend this lotion ONLY IF purchased on ebay. It is definitely not worth $65 dollars, but for $20 I am pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> this stuff is $70.00 in the salon, so this was a good price for a good product, would recommend this to my friends.</li>
            <li> I think most people who buy products off Amazon for $50 cheaper than normal don&#x27;t understand that you&#x27;re buying it either expired or its only half tanning lotion &amp; half normal lotion. I work at a salon myself for a year now. I know what goes on with selling lotions. A lot of salons will actually sell expired lotion without knowing its expired. As long as it&#x27;s not over a year &amp; you don&#x27;t leave it in your car, it should work just fine. Bought mine, it was a few days expired but it still works just as great.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t want to be a celebrity band wagoner but couldn&#x27;t resist the great reviews and I was not disappointed whatsoever! Great product would definitely recommend and will buy again when I run out. Price is way better than from the tanning salon for sure.</li>
            <li> I just got this lotion today,Which I was very pleased about.Overnight shipping is a great thing:)  I&#x27;m a tanning bed freak.I love to tan, My skin isn&#x27;t easy to tan. It&#x27;s taken my 5 months to get really tan.I&#x27;ve tried every DEVOTED CREATION lotion there is.  This was my first \\&quot;Australian Gold\\&quot; lotion I have ever tried. I go to SOUTH BEACH TANNING in Oldsmar,Florida.I always do the highest levels. 4 and 5. I have never seen my skin so smooth and dark. It&#x27;s a beautiful bronzer and has outstanding moisturizers in it. I also love the scent! Very refreshing.  #1:Royality-Devoted Creations  #2:Situation-Devoted Creations  #3:JWOWW BLACK BRONZER-Australian Gold  Hope this helped&lt;3   -Best Regards</li>
            <li> Feels good but never looked tan after using it</li>
            <li> It gave me a dark bronze in just a couple weeks ! I didn&#x27;t know if it would work that fast and it did !</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of lotions in the past and have never been as dark as I am now. I love this lotion. I only used it a couple of times and I am already darker than I usually get all season. Can&#x27;t beat the price either.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews I thought this tanning lotion would be great, but I am very light skin and this product did not work for me at all!</li>
            <li> Works great gives u color</li>
            <li> My favorite tanning lotion of all time! It gets me tan right away. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I used this tanning lotion for the first time today and I am in love! I usually tan a redish/brown color but today i got out of the tanning bed and I was a dark brown color! YAY! Buy this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the seller I purchased from, but I was not too impressed with this lotion.  I&#x27;ve heard it&#x27;s supposed to have a berry smell to it...and mine had a sort of medical smell to it.  I&#x27;ve only used it twice and from what I can tell it seems to give me good color, but I&#x27;m starting to wonder if it&#x27;s watered down or something. Hmm.</li>
            <li> Read all the reviews, and was sold by what so many people wrote.. HOWEVER, I am starting to think JWOWW&#x27;s fan club wrote the reviews.  I have been using this for nearly 2 weeks, and CAN NOT tell a difference.  The lotion smell isnt bad, it&#x27;s just not working like I thought it would.  I would NOT reccomend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this after my tanning salon recommended this product.  I had immediate color after using this with a high pressure tanning bed.  I can&#x27;t get over how I went from pasty white to a couple shades higher in just 2 tanning sessions.  It also smells wonderful after using and your skin feels great as well.  It has hemp seed in it, which is supposed to be awesome for the skin so very well pleased.</li>
            <li> My skin ALWAYS dries out when I tan.. After using jwoww lotion only twice, my skin is soft and moisturized and it has really boosted the tan I already had! The smell seemed strong at first but it is amazing - no gross after tan smell. BUY THIS LOTION!  :)</li>
            <li> I always purchase very good quality , tanning lotion , usually I buhy designer , long ago , I was always purchasing , Australian Gold &lt; or Swedish Beauty , now , I read the feedback  of this lotion , and I decided to give it a try , and I&#x27;m very happy , very dark, the only think it&#x27;s not better than Designer is the smell , it&#x27;s ok , but not the best !!!(I wanna be honest )</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite tanning lotion, the price is right , it makes me so dark , leaves my skin feeling silky smooth, and doesn&#x27;t leave you smelling burned after you tan ! Highly recommended and I will def buy again !</li>
            <li> I bought this to see what all the hype was about and honestly it&#x27;s nothing special. It&#x27;s watery compared to the others I&#x27;ve used and didn&#x27;t really help me tan at all.</li>
            <li> This lotion is not what it is made out to be. I bought it due to the reviews that talked so highly of it. I tan very easily, I only need to tan once a week maybe two times to keep a nice dark tan. I went tanning three times in a week and did not get any color from this lotion, it was like I didnt use any lotion. Also you still smell like a tanning bed and burnt skin slightly with this lotion, the smell is not anything close to how people described it in the reviews..I would not recommend this lotion if looking for a good,dark tan. Sorry ladies...</li>
            <li> One of the best lotions I&#x27;ve tried!  It smells great and doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling all gross after my tan (well grosser than I usually do)</li>
            <li> This lotion is amazing!!!!  It smells great, it gives even better results and I can&#x27;t believe the price!!  I love the deep brown color it gives me. It gave me a deep dark color after the first use and gets better every time. I&#x27;ve used $100 lotions and JWOW&#x27;s lotion blows the expensive bottles out of the water.  For those of you reading these reviews, know this...the people giving bad reviews are just hating on JWOW lol.  I don&#x27;t know how anyone could give this a bad review.  I recommend it highly to everyone.  Try it, you&#x27;ll love it!! I&#x27;ve found my favorite lotion and I have tried them all!</li>
            <li> i bought this from my local solon. i recently had a baby, so i hadn&#x27;t been tanning since june 2010. it&#x27;s march 2011, and i&#x27;ve only tanned for three days and have a great result, even using the lowest power bed! i have fair skin that doesn&#x27;t tan outside, and i must use the tanning bed. it was a good purchase, and i recommend it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely a joke dont buy this and save yourself the hives and rashes that comes with it. My rash was so bad i had to be rushed to the emergency room because it caused me to also have an asthma attack due to the allergic reaction!!! Buyer BEWARE!!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product. I have tried serveral this year and this is my favorite one. I am fair and have a difficult time tanning but this product works very well for me. I have been able to keep moderate color by only tanning a couple times a week. You do have that tanning bed smell for a little while after you get out but I notice it fades fairly quickly. I have had a problem with brozers staining my clothes in the past and this has not been a problem with this product.</li>
            <li> This is great to use and so much more economic than buying at the salon.  This really makes your tan look awesome.  I get alot of compliments.</li>
            <li> great stuff just like the 60dollar bottle I had from the salon</li>
            <li> I ordered this lotion because everyone I talked to suggested it! I am glad I did!!! It&#x27;s a great tanning lotion! Smells good &amp; works even better!  After one week of using it, I am 2 shades darker, at least! If you&#x27;re looking for a good first time bronzer, this is it! Looking forward to my next JWoww purchase!</li>
            <li> I bought a bottle of this and then was sent a email saying shippment would be delayed. I could cancel the order if I wanted to. But I decided to wait for shippment. I did receive my order as promised. Thanks so much</li>
            <li> I want to first start off by saying I tan easily and hardly ever burn. I have been been tanning at a salon for about 2 months now. I have bought Australian Gold Gelee w/ Bronzers at the tanning salon. I have used Jwoww lotion 3x now and I see no difference. I think they put \\&quot;Black Bronzer\\&quot; on the label so it makes you think you will get a darker tan. Well I have compared the Jwoww lotion and the one I bought at the salon and if you look at the ingredients the Australian Gold has more ingredents and it seems to work better than Jwoww. Do not let the bottle, Black bronzer, or the product name FOOL YOU!</li>
            <li> I have been used \\&quot;Jwoww\\&quot; for 2 tannings and I am already seeing a definate difference. I am white as white can be and I have tanned before with some different lotion, and I am really, really impressed with \\&quot;Jwoww\\&quot;. It makes your skin really soft too. The smell prior to tanning is decent, but afterward it kinda bad. But if you use Designer Skin&#x27;s \\&quot;Angel Daily Moisturizer\\&quot; (the yellow bottle) it makes your skin even more soft and smells wonderful! I will be using this lotion for a long time! I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> this product smells good. it doesn&#x27;t leave skin feeling slimy as with other lotions. it almost disappears in your skin. i don&#x27;t find it is tanning me as quick as the reviews i read. i saw better results from the australian gold sinfully black. its a good product and worth the price. i would recommend strictly on the fact that you don&#x27;t smell like you&#x27;ve been in a tanning bed after use. its getting me dark enough to counteract the no-tanning-bed-smell, huge plus.</li>
            <li> This is by far THE BEST tanning lotion I have ever used. Not only does it smell great (like berries) but it makes you DARK! I have used tons of bronzers over the years, and this one takes the cake. I hear it is limited edition so I plan on stocking up. I promise you will not be disappointed with this product!</li>
            <li> After reading many reviews online including a few &#x27;best tanning lotions&#x27; lists, JWOWW was up in the top 5 recommended lotions so I decided to give it a try.  I was honestly really afraid many people were buying it just for the name on the bottle. BUT I decided to go ahead and try it anyway even though I am not a jersey shore fan..lol. REALLY REALLY GLAD I DID!!! Don&#x27;t be afraid that AG will slap &#x27;Jwoww&#x27; on the bottle and make a crumby product to put in it because that is ABSOLUTELY NOT WHAT THEY DID!!!  EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE!! Tanned once with it &amp; I have a gorgeous bronze tan!! PERFECT. I tan pretty easily, but I have had lotions in the past that didn&#x27;t get me real dark and others that just turned me BROWN.. which brown is alright if that&#x27;s what you want, but I want to be bronze! Golden bronze brown all perfectly mixed. I couldn&#x27;t be happier. This is the very first time I have ever reviewed anything. I thought so much of this lotion that I decided to give it 5 stars easily! Not sure why anyone would rate it any lower.. maybe they have a different skin type dunno, but don&#x27;t hesitate to give jwoww a try regardless of the silly name on the bottle! :-)  It also does smell AMAZING! I am not greasy, but my skin does feel VERY soft!! It is a tad sticky (just barely) at first when you get it on, but that is gone by the time you get out of the bed. No problems with it. Very surprised with the results. I&#x27;ll bet I&#x27;ll only need to tan once a week with this lotion and stay really dark!</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product per a employee&#x27;s best suggestion and I have to say it&#x27;s not really worth my money. I have used it several times and I have some color when I finish tanning and then after a few hours I have the same tan I had before I went tanning with it. I love my designer skin products and i do have a couple of austrailian products but this is my least favorite out of all of them.</li>
            <li> The lady that owns the tanning salon i go to told me that everyone raves about this lotion. I didn&#x27;t want to pay the price at the salon so i ordered it off here. I think the only good thing about this lotion is that it doesn&#x27;t make you super greasy like many other lotions do. It doesn&#x27;t smell nearly as well as i thought it would and believe it or not this lotion made me at least 2 shades LIGHTER from the first use. Everyone noticed. Needless to say, i won&#x27;t be using JWOWW lotion again.</li>
            <li> i have not noticed any change in color at all since using this product.  it goes on really smooth and feels silky but my color did not change one bit.</li>
            <li> Aweful..did not work big waste of money</li>
            <li> I purchased a sample of this lotion from a tanning salon I was using. It smells AWESOME before, and after you tan it still smells great! You don&#x27;t have that nasty tanning smell.  I also am impressed with how fast it works.  The solution this is made from really works. I will keep using it!</li>
            <li> Leaves skin with a nice tan color and moisturizing. Great price. Arrived as expected.</li>
            <li> I bought this tanning lotion about a month ago from Amazon.com, it came in the mail rather quick. When I first started using it in the tanning bed, I got a couple shades darker each time I went tanning. But that only lasted about two weeks. Then I was just not tanning as quick and as easy as I had been. I had to switch to a different lotion to get that darker, deeper tan I was looking for.  GREAT product if you&#x27;re a person not looking for a super duper deep dark tan, and are just looking for a nice base tan. Gets you a nice light brown color but nothing too fancy and dark sadly. Thought it would work better then it did. I find that Designer Skin Black tanning lotion works better then this if you want to get great results fast. :)</li>
            <li> I recieved my jwoww tanning lotion super quick...great communication from seller...product is what was described and im loving it, thanks!</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome.  Not crazy about the after smell, but I haven&#x27;t found a tanning lotion yet that made you smell good after tanning.  It gives great color, goes on smooth, and I didn&#x27;t break out from it like I have other ones.  And the price is right!</li>
            <li> This lotion is amazing! After using it just once, (i didn&#x27;t even tan the whole time. I tanned 15 out of the twenty minutes) I could see a difference in my color! Smells good, too. :)</li>
            <li> PAYING HALF PRICE IS MUCH BETTER THAN PAYING FULL PRICE AT TANNING SALON SO DEFINITELY WORTH THE MONEY. I LOVE THE SMELL AND GIVES YOU A NICE DARK TAN.</li>
            <li> very good lotion makes you dark and your skin feeling good.  I use this in an upgrade bed which i used to burn in, and now using this lotion i can see very good results, very good price alot better than buying in the salon which is double the price.  If you are looking for a good lotion with a good scent and makes you very dark,  Good Stuff</li>
            <li> I bought this at my local tanning salon. I bit on the pricey side but well worth it! I didnt expect to see anything after one use but i did. Nothing mega but it was something. I&#x27;m excited to use it again today! I recommend this to people who already have a base tan going on</li>
            <li> I had been tanning for a while before I started using this.  Even though I was tanning 2-3 times a week, I had seemed to hit a plateau that I couldn&#x27;t get over.  The people in my salon kept giving me different suggestions, but they were always so expensive to buy in the shop.  Eventually, I saw a girl walk in with this bottle and asked the girl at the counter about it.  She said they used to sell it, and it was always a big hit with people who were already pretty dark.  I decided to order it to test it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me tell you, this is some powerful stuff!  Not only did it tan my naturally olive complexion perfectly, but it helped me get over my plateau.  The smell isn&#x27;t the greatest, but I was tanning in the evening anyway.  This stuff is amazing.  Seriously.</li>
            <li> I purchased this after my trip to Mexico in January to keep up my tan with indoor tanning. I tan around 3x a week and my tan is wonderful.</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews &amp; I was convinced. Yes, other reviews are right - smells good. But after a Month of Continuous use, I dont look much tanner. Now, don&#x27;t get me wrong - I have a base, I&#x27;m not Ghostly white - but it did not help enhance my tan to the next level. Won&#x27;t buy again. So onto the next one...let&#x27;s hope I find a good one now.</li>
            <li> If you want to use this as a moisturizer then go for it. But in terms of it actually getting you dark, try something else. It smells good, but I do not feel any darker using it.</li>
            <li> I had ordered my JWOWW Black of Amazon (A-Z Wholesale Tanning Lotions to be exact) while using my Amazon Prime account. Had received the product within 2 days, and I must say... I really saw results. My results though, were a little scary. I am already tan, even before I started tanning. Being of Asian and Caucasian mixed decent, my skin is naturally tan. Just not as tan as I would like. Anyway, after using this I saw instant results. I would say that it had gotten me 2 shades darker if not 3 shades. That was what got me freaked out, though. It didn&#x27;t look realistic. It looked like a spray tan in a way. No glow to it. Just dark, burnt-like, matte skin. The smell of the product is nice, so that was a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you shower though, most of the bronzer washes off. Leaving you with a nice tanned glow, so I recommend testing it out with a sample from your salon. See if that&#x27;s what you are looking for, and if you decide to buy online make sure to ONLY buy from sellers with good reputations.</li>
            <li> Jwoww&#x27;s Black Bronzer was my first really quality tanning lotion.  I got it around the end of my first month of tanning, and was so excited. This stuff is pretty darn great I must say!  I got extremely dark extremely fast, but you have to remember with all the bronzers comes some downfalls.  When you exfoliate really well in the shower, your shade of color may tone down a lot more than you would think, and you&#x27;ll be a little more than surprised to see your dark color isn&#x27;t as dark as you truly thought.  Really though, that happens with any bronzer lotion.  Other than that of course, it smells wonderful and doesn&#x27;t have an awful after-tanning smell to it, it goes on so smooth and it&#x27;s a great lotion to keep you moisturized!</li>
            <li> I have been tanning for years and tried all different types of products. I used this product and noticed a difference within the first session. I didn&#x27;t buy it because of JWOWW, but because of what I have heard about it. It smells great and is a LOT cheaper to buy online than in the salon. I admit I was hesitant to buy it online but I purchased it from Amazon directly not another seller and and thoroughly happy with the product! It smells great and didn&#x27;t leave a tingling feeling or any other weird feelings afterwards.</li>
            <li> it works great outside and leaves a rich tan color. my second bottle. will purchase again next summer. good price compared to tanning salons</li>
            <li> Got this for a GREAT price!!! Thank goodness I didn&#x27;t decide to buy it directly from the tanning salon! It was worth the wait to order it online!</li>
            <li> This bronzer works great.  It has a great color to it and the price was WAY cheaper than buying it in a tannig salon.  Shipping was fast too.  Would recommend for sure!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this lotion for about 3 weeks and it works well. I like the smell, it isn&#x27;t greasy, and there is no after odor (at least not one I notice).  I will say that the tan is slow to start but it won&#x27;t make you dark fast. It is a good beginning lotion. I&#x27;m about to try this one with the 50x bronzer and see if it does more for my color. It doesn&#x27;t make you orange or streaky. Overall it isn&#x27;t a bad lotion.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few weeks now and I haven&#x27;t noticed any change in my color.  It smells great but thats all I can say thats positive.</li>
            <li> I bought this product months ago. It ended up doing nothing. Thats when I realized at the tanning salon that this bottle was not even tanning lotion. It was a fake. Easy to figure out if you cut the package off and see that the bottle underneath is not the same as the normal jwoww bottle. Complete waste of my money.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed, I&#x27;ve purchased other Austrailian Gold products in the past &amp; have loved them but I see absolutely no results from this bronzer.</li>
            <li> Im not sure about this product. It seemed too watery, didnt seem to be like the one i had recieved from a tanning bed for my bday. But didnt complain too much. It wasnt expensive so.... But i did get it in mail fast :)</li>
            <li> I used this lotion one time, my first time tanning in about a year.  The smell is not overpowering and is pleasant.  The tan?  All I could say was I was amazed when I came out of the bed and an hour or two later noticed that after 6 minutes in the bed, I have color!!!  Love it, love it, love it....</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, no problems.</li>
            <li> Luv this product no funny smell and not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> received in good quality</li>
            <li> I have been using Jwoww for a week, and I&#x27;m already way more tan than I was.  I had been using a cheap lotion because I didn&#x27;t believe the hype that the expensive lotions really worked.  Finally decided to try it since the girls at the salon kept pushing me.  I fell in love!  My skin is bronze and beautiful and feels amazing.  Its soft and where I was breaking out from the cheap lotion my skin is clearing up and I won&#x27;t be using any other lotion in the future.</li>
            <li> I ordered this package Wednesday night and got it on Saturday morning, I was shocked it came so quick! I first used this in my tanning salon (the sample size) and I instantly noticed how tan I got! I was using another lotion that did absolutely nothing for me. This tanning lotion rubs on like a moisturizing lotion, which I like, and it doesn&#x27;t have any disgusting fake tan smell or any greasy texture on the skin after it&#x27;s use.</li>
            <li> This Lotion is awesome i used it for the first time today ... and some results immediatly The fragrance is also very nice   Nice natural dark tan ... AWESOME !!!</li>
            <li> Jwoww black bronzer smells bad, and I did not see any results after using it. I tan often and have tried numerous lotions and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this lotion to anyone. It smells and works poorly, seems identical to one of the cheaper australian gold lotions called sinfully black. Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this tanning lotion!  It smells great and I am able to use it on my lunch hour since it doesn&#x27;t smell really perfumie especially since I work somewhere that allows no perfumes to be worn to work.  I will be using this from now on!</li>
            <li> I have used many diffrent indoor tanning products but this one has given me that nice natural color I have been looking for.</li>
            <li> I placed my order and it was shipped the next day I was impressed that it arrived sooner than the actual date posted I have to say its a great product I was referred to amazon drom the young lady at the tanning salon because I was unhappy with a product I purchased at the salon and her boss would not exchange this product smells and works  great and perfectly priced u get more than ur money worth thanks amazon</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let your Jersey Shore prejudices steer you away from this stuff. It creates super-fast results with no orange tinting (insert joke here), goes on easily, doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or oily, and the scent is so pleasant and clean, I&#x27;m hoping a line of moisturizers is soon to follow. This product is well worth it&#x27;s price. Instantly my favorite tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! Noticed instant results and the fragrance is subtle not overpowering. Great if you want be tan fast and stay tan!</li>
            <li> I have been a serious tanner for years now and always look for the best products with the best outcomes. I have tried pretty much everything on the market just to say whats good and whats not. This last year when I started my tanning sessions, I looked for a great bronzer, that wouldnt make me itch or turn me red as a lobster. I dont like products with any type tingle. When I went to the salon, the girl recommended JWOWW, I was a bit skeptical as it was quiet pricy. But read over it, and then smelled how great it smelled and purchased it. It was the BEST buy I have made towards my tanning. It tans my face and my legs ( which seem to take AGES to tan), my tummy is reallly dark and I have only been using it a couple weeks. It is a definite buy is you are a serious tanner, looking for a great dark, beautiful even tan. I LOVE this product! Although, now that I know Amazon carries it, Ill be buying from Amazon rather than the crazy price my salon sells it for!!!!! If you feel your at the plateau of your tanning and cant get darker, try this....You will defiantly see a difference!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this after using a sample packet at my tanning salon.  I really like the fragrance and the smooth application.  I especially loved the amazon price, less than half of what the salon charges!   As far as the product, it works really well.  It got me a nice golden start to my tanning.  Will buy again!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this tanning lotion! It&#x27;s not sticky or greasy feeling. It feels like normal lotion and you can&#x27;t even tell you have it on! It also smells really good. I love it :)</li>
            <li> Sorry but this product suuuuucked to be quite frank:( It definately is not worth all of the hype it got or the money. You are totally paying for the name, not the product with this one. I didn&#x27;t see a difference at all in my color and was very disappointed. It smells good, but that&#x27;s about the only positive thing I could think of. I&#x27;ve never been a big fan of any of the australian gold products, but was hoping this would have been different. It&#x27;s not though. I am more of a designer skin gal all the way. For me, their products are incredible and are the best when you want to achieve the deepest darkest tan. Obsidian is # 1. I&#x27;ve tried them all and that is the only one that gives me a noticable difference.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST tanning lotion that I have ever used! I have only used it twice and already I have noticed a difference. It is not runny like most lotions either, and it smells great! You will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I really like this as well!!</li>
            <li> Works great!  Bad smell at first.  I actually left mine out in the car everyday since I go tanning after work and the bad smell went away after about a week.  The bronzer itself definitely works well though! I would order again! :)</li>
            <li> Just an average tanning lotion.  Conditions skin prior to tanning but left with the tanning bed smell afterwards.  Probably wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> Unfortunatly this product did not work for me. Maybe for others but not me. May work for someone who does not have a base tan but I did.</li>
            <li> I highly recomment this lotion, smells awesome and doesn&#x27;t leave the nasty residue that most bronzers leave.&lt;br /&gt;My fav lotion ever!!!!</li>
            <li> Another great tanning product! Have had great results out of the Australian Gold Jwoww Black Bronzer Dark Tanning Lotion. Could see results after a few days.</li>
            <li> This lotion smells really great, and the smell does not change after tanning. I also like the consistency.  Everbody has their own preferences when it comes to consistency, for me the light, easy to rub on texture was perfect as I hate the thick creamy ones.  I also felt after one use I already had some color (then again I hadn&#x27;t been tanning in a couple weeks).  Overall the great smell it unbeatable.</li>
            <li> Great product .. Smells good and works great ! The shipping was really fast also! Reasonable price! Only downfall was the size wish it was a little bigger! But defiantly a must have product !</li>
            <li> This stuff takes your tan to the next level! Love! Will buy again!</li>
            <li> The lotion is awesome! It makes me so tan, just using it one time makes a HUGE difference.  The only problem with ordering it from here, is that it took a year and a half to get to my house! BS  Product is awesome though.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an okay product, wish it wold make me bronzer quicker.  Ive been using this for over a month and I just started noticing a little tan.</li>
            <li> this lotion DOES give a good color, but it fades pretty quick :/  ...honestly id spend my money on BLACK by Designer Skin...that is BY FAR the best lotion i have ever used! i am a red head and have tried LOTS of lotions, so im just tryin to save ya&#x27;ll some money ;) a few other lotions i LOVED that had good lasting color were: designer skin belezza and designer skin queen! they aren&#x27;t quite as expensive as black, but are still great!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t even give it a 1/2 star if possible.  I have been tanning for many years and have used very expensive and in-expensive tanning lotions.  My last experience was with a tingle and bronzer that gave me immediate results after one use.  This product is an over prized gimmick because of the name \\&quot;JWOW\\&quot;, she obviously does not use it herself and sticks to her airbrush tans.   It claims it has a great smell, it doesn&#x27;t smell any different than any other tanning lotion out there. I had a great tan, and since using this product have lost it.  I have used $10 bottles of lotion that work better than this.  Don&#x27;t waste your time or money!</li>
            <li> I bought this and regret buying it. It is not for people just beginning to tan or people who have tanned frequently. It does not smell all that great and it does not help you tan as well as other high end brand tanning lotion do. If you want a cheaper tanning lotion that works just as well, go to the grocery store and buy a $10 dollar one. They price this one like it was a high quality brand. My advice is spend an extra $10 and get a way better tanning lotion or just go to a store and buy a $10 one.</li>
            <li> So I after 3 years of NOT tanning, I couldn&#x27;t take the Casper-ness that had taken over my skin so I decided to tan again for summer. The guy at my local salon gave me a sample of the JWoww lotion to try and I loved it. The smell is good and doesn&#x27;t leave an \\&quot;after tanning smell\\&quot; It does have a thinner consistency but that&#x27;s OK by me since the product does work. It doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling greasy like other lotions can do. This is definitely a good lotion for beginners who need to build a base.    I will always buy lotions from Amazon now. The guy at my salon tried to sell this to me for $60 which I decline and bought from Glamour Tanning for $20. Nice try though, bro!    (Also, the people who gave this product a bad review must have gotten a bad batch or something b/c nothing they&#x27;ve experienced has happened to me with mine.)</li>
            <li> I ordered this lotion about 2 weeks ago and love the price I got it for especially since it sells in the tanning salon for $59! I am happy with it i would just be a lil mad if I paid $59 for it from my tanning salon because after taking a shower your color fades just a lil bit because it doesn&#x27;t have a lasting bronzer in it, other then that its very smooth and doesn&#x27;t leave you streaky or sticky and the smell is great even after tanning your skin doesn&#x27;t have that burnt smell! I love dark lasting bronzers so as soon as I finish this bottle I probably wont buy it again!</li>
            <li> I purchased this lotion here on Amazon on Friday and recieved it early this afternoon. Soon after recieving it I went to the tanning salon to try it out and I LOVE IT. Im going on a cruise the end of the month and I needed something to give me some color, after only laying 13 mins (didnt wanna fry myself first run) I have noticable color!! And after reading the reviews (some good some bad) about the smell, let me tell you the smell is light and airy. Not heavy like someothers. I actually like this smell because If I were to go run errands or do some shopping I wouldn&#x27;t have that \\&quot;I just tanned\\&quot; smell.  ALSO: The price is great! After talking to the lady who owns the salon I go to she looked up the lotion in her booked and realized I got it 2$ less than her cost!</li>
            <li> this is a very great product! i love how it helps my tan and the smell is so good too. i will definately be purchasing this one again!</li>
            <li> Worked well used it in a bronzing bed and it browned me right up</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS! I have been using it for a couple years. Within 2-3 times tanning I already have a noticeable tan. I am fair skinned. Lotions are so expensive at the tanning salons it&#x27;s nice being able to order them here.</li>
            <li> Did not work, I have got it at salon before and it was awesome so I don&#x27;t think I got the real product, very disappointing</li>
            <li> Pefect ! Came fast a++±</li>
            <li> I threw this item out!! It had an expired date!!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion! Used it about three times and was super dark! I would recommend this lotion for everyone! It smells great too.</li>
            <li> I do quite a bit of tanning and I just loved this product.  I love the smell and I love the look of my skin after tanning with this product!</li>
            <li> I could see a difference after the first use. I am fair skin and it usually take some time to see any color on me.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. After like two uses I had my base tan and it smells good. You can also use this lotion out doors.</li>
            <li> Great product, arrived just on time, very pleased with result! I&#x27;ve been tanning for several years and although it is not my favorite lotion, it is pretty high up there. I definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> This Tanning Lotion Was Pretty Good! It Had A Instant Color In It And It Smelled Pretty Good. I Knew It Was Going To Be Good Because It Was Made By JWOWW, So I Figured I Would Try It, And It Made Me Pretty Tan. My Tan Is A Mix Between Like a Red Tint And A Golden Bronze. I Also Noticed That I Got A Little Red, As In Burn. Overall This Product Was Very Good And At A Reasonable Price!</li>
            <li> I recently ordered this lotion and was so excited to get it and use it. I already had a base tan because I had been tanning for about 3 weeks. I haven&#x27;t been getting any darker so I decided to try a lotion. The price was really good on this lotion, and it smells really good, but I didn&#x27;t get any darker from using it. I have used the lotion 3 times in the last week and it didn&#x27;t shorten my bed time or make me any darker. I&#x27;m really disappointed. Just ordered designer skin black, hoping it works better than JWoww.</li>
            <li> Ok SO here&#x27;s a little lesson for all of you- *if you aren&#x27;t getting dark it&#x27;s because you&#x27;re washing the lotion off TOO SOON! BRONZERS SHOULD BE LEFT ON FOR A DECENT AMOUNT OF TIME! Leave it on for a minimum of \\&quot;4-8 HOURS\\&quot;, if possible &amp; you will see the BEAUTIFUL \\&quot;BROWN\\&quot; color take over your skin.  (Just be sure to wash your hands immediately after use to avoid BROWN PALM! TIP- I use a paper towel to put the lotion on the top of my hands) Ok? Did ya take note?? Good,NOW DO IT! 5 STAR LOTION, GREAT PRICE &amp; A SMELL that&#x27;s not bad to the nose at all! &#x3D;D</li>
            <li> I have been using \\&quot;Made for Love\\&quot; which I really like, but I just wanted something different... I bought this after seeing so many good reviews, and I was really impressed. I didn&#x27;t notice any major \\&quot;holy crap I&#x27;m so dark\\&quot; moments, but I did notice a really nice overall tan effect- I have tanned twice with this and have definitely developed a darker color than I had before.  Another bonus is that it smells good- it doesn&#x27;t have a really strong smell, but I leave the tanning bed without having the really bad tanning funk (not to say I don&#x27;t smell at all but it is nowhere near what I have experienced with other lotions).  I would recommend this to anyone, good smell, good tan, and it makes you skin feel silky.</li>
            <li> I guess this must be a good product. My girl friend loves it. She uses it everyday and now I look very pale when I am next to her. Thanks for making her smile.</li>
            <li> I sampled this product at my local salon and found that after tanning my skin was so soft and my color was more natural after tanning than it had been with other products.  I have continued to use it ever since with the same results.  I will buy this product again in the future!</li>
            <li> Love it everyone has commented on my tan!!!!  Great product!!!!🌞🌞🌞</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first to buy tanning lotion at such a cheap price on Amazon but this stuff works amazing. I have never been tanner! I heard its so cheap because they only fill it half way but i got a full bottle for sure!</li>
            <li> I received an EMPTY BOX! but glad I did and I got my money back, because my friend that owns a tanning salon said that this is Jwows first ever tanning lotion..which means its probably expired..tanning lotions only have a shelf life of two years, after that it expires, which means it wont work like it is suppose to and itll have a funny smell....</li>
            <li> My wife loves this tanning lotion. She gets an awesome sexy tan fast with this lotion. I think it even smells good too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worked in a tanning Salon for 4+ years.  I&#x27;ve never been able to find lotions that I can stick with for awhile.  I wasn&#x27;t so sure about this lotion, but I actually really like it.  For the price you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion! The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 is because the smell isn&#x27;t the best, but it works really good and I got a nice tan fast :)</li>
            <li> I like using this lotion because it does give me quite a bit of color and smells good. There are probably other lotions that would make you super dark in a shorter amount of time but this one is fairly decent.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this lotion. A co-worker of mine uses it, and she has great color, so I asked what she was using, and it was this. I don&#x27;t think I will be using anything else!</li>
            <li> My bottle did not have the berry sent that everyone talks about when purchasing this product, and I feel it did not give me a deep tan that I wanted. I&#x27;ve definitely had better tanning lotions. This makes me doubt this product is the legit JWOWW tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> I already have a good base tan.  I&#x27;m blonde with green eyes so you know the skin type.  I&#x27;ve been to the salon 7 times this season so far.  I bought a sample of the JWOWW Black Bronzer and I AM AMAZED at the color after going today.  I am definitely buying this product!!!!  I have been a loyal Designer Skin user, but I think I&#x27;m switching to this for just the awesome difference in just one session!!!  LOVE!!!!</li>
            <li> Basically smells like perfume and didn&#x27;t make me any tanner and I used almost the whole bottle. There are much better tanning lotions that work out there. Don&#x27;t bother with this one.</li>
            <li> This lotion smells amazing as well as gives you a great brown color.  Definitely helped me achieve a dark look quickly.</li>
            <li> I bought this due to the rave of it and thought it will be great , without reading any reviews.... well I have used it for about 5 mon now to really get the product used in many ways It is not a deep bronzer and it washes off immediately rather u shower right after or 48 hrs later. I am not impressed at all and the smell could be better. Jus not what I had hoped. not worth the money and I do like J woww jus not this product.</li>
            <li> Awesome product and quick delivery. I will buy from this seller again in the future. The lotion works very well and I have noticed a big difference in my tanning due to this product.</li>
            <li> item came in and is not the &amp;#34;real deal&amp;#34; Has a shrink wrap covering that isn&#x27;t even placed on bottle properly, and a total different label then the real one. , Totally unhappy. RIPPED OFF</li>
            <li> This lotion is okay. The smell is just okay, nothing to brag about. Also this lotion does not help keep the color. The color appears as fast as it fades. I don&#x27;t like to go tanning everyday and this lotion requires that to keep the color. Not a fan of this at all.</li>
            <li> I have started tanning again and I have gone maybe 3 times, all under 15 minutes and I already have a beautiful color. This product works. No doubt about it, and it smells good too! It is my favorite bronzer so far, and I have tanned since I was about 16 years old and have tried a lot of products.</li>
            <li> This indoor tanning lotion is amazing</li>
            <li> Got a great bronze tan. I used it mostly laying out in the sun and I got DARK, nut not orangey. I used it in a bed as well, but I love it in the natural sun too.</li>
            <li> As an avid tanner, I have tried nearly every tanning lotion there is.  I am especially pleased with this one.  It smells great, and leaves no &amp;#34;burnt skin&amp;#34; smell after getting out of the tanning bed.  This is definitely one of the better lotions out there and I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I DONT LIKE THIS LOTION AS MUCH AS THE JWOW ONE &amp; DONE! IT&#x27;LL WORK, BUT WONT PURCHASE THIS ONE AGAIN.</li>
            <li> I sometimes have tingling or burning sensations with bronzers, but no problem at all with this one. Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I have used this product many times  and I love it. All of her tanning lotions are great!! Thank you</li>
            <li> Just what I ordered &amp; came really fast &amp; wrapped new, product is great, love this product, works amazing its a repurchase I have made several times</li>
            <li> I bought this product hoping for a cheaper alternative to the expensive bronzer I use.  However this product is in no way, shape, or form a bronzer.  Don&#x27;t be fooled by the name \\&quot;Black Bronzer\\&quot;.  This did nothing to change my skin color even after two weeks.  Needless to say I went back to my old bronzer.  However I did use this as an enhancer to my bronzer and saw great results.</li>
            <li> It smells great, has the perfect amount of bronzer and doesn&#x27;t leave that thick lotion feeling. by the time you get out of the bed, you&#x27;re ready to get dressed and leave, no sweat, no grim.</li>
            <li> Love this product - gives me a darker, richer looking tan........ &amp; the price is unbeatable compared to the Salon I go to.... I realize they&#x27;ve got to make money - but that&#x27;s almost high way robbery..... can&#x27;t beat the price on Amazon.com...... love this store...&lt;br /&gt;great service - always gets to my door b4 they say........Yay for Amazon!!!</li>
            <li> I am extremely fair skin, but am able to tan with time and consistency. This lotion gave me a nice golden bronze color quicker than any other type of lotion I&#x27;ve used. I have been tanning on and off since I was 18 years old. I am 22 and can tell you that I&#x27;ve gone through many lotions. This is by far my favorite!</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a good tanning lotion that does what it says its going to do, I would high recommend this product! Came exactly as it was described!</li>
            <li> The product came and it is about a month expired...my guess is that they still want to move the product and that is why it is so cheap...I&#x27;m still going to use it but it IS EXPIRED.</li>
            <li> I have always liked this brand I usually get the one with the energizing Turner in it absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I got tan very quick with this lotion and I t smells great. Definitely the best tanning lotion. I loved it!</li>
            <li> Listen to me when I say I have spent hundreds on lotions, from Designer Skin to Kim K lotions, they do NOT compare to the intense dark color you get from this lotion. One use and I difference, and it doesn&#x27;t wash out! by day 3, I looked like Ive been on a vacation in hawaii for weeks. well worth the money!</li>
            <li> Lotion smells good and works great, cant beat the price! Will be ordering more soon</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly, and it was sealed. Definitely helps me get darker quicker! The smell isn&#x27;t bad, but it isn&#x27;t what I expected.</li>
            <li> This lotion is awesome. Has a silky texture, so it goes on smooth and you dont have to use a lot. I really enjoy the smell, and it still smells good even after tanning. Would definitely recommend, the price is much better than what you&#x27;ll find in the salons</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any difference at all</li>
            <li> My lotion I bought came out chunky and when I applied it it left streak marks when I tanned.</li>
            <li> I gave this 3 stars because I loved it when I purchased it from the salon, which was over priced of course, so I bought it here at a much cheaper price! and I loved that. the lotion smells great and does give you a good color. only problem I had with ordering from here is that it left me with an itchy rash after every use. which I wasn&#x27;t experiencing with the same lotion purchased in the salon. I don&#x27;t know if I suddenly became allergic to whats in this lotion or it was just a bad batch. im wondering if anyone else has had this problem?</li>
            <li> love it works great on me i tan very fast anyways but this is amazing great bronze look</li>
            <li> The feel of the lotion is nice, silky and makes my skin feel hydrated. The smell is pretty gross! I feel gross after tanning with this very odd scent! I&#x27;ve switched due to the smell! Don&#x27;t buy if your not able to immediately shower after every time!</li>
            <li> This is the same exact product thats in the tanning salons for more than double the price.i tested it out by buying a sample of it at the place i tan and it is same product and i had the same results. I would definately recommend this.</li>
            <li> The product came as promised and works great!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite lotion and trust me I have tried a lot of tanning lotions. It gives you that bronze look very quickly and doesn&#x27;t make you orange.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion! Works amazing! Am using it for my wedding!</li>
            <li> Just received this in the mail yesterday. I used it yesterday and today and so far I LOVE IT. It seems like the real deal, has the berry smell, and I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in my tan after only two days. I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> How do you not love this lotion. It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> Love this lotion! Smells awesome not too fruity and works amazing. No streaks and i was able to see results right away.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It smells so fruity and unliike most tanning lotions. It has some bronzer in it that I did not know about but it has never left streaks on me or looked weird. I can tell because I am obviously tanner right after applying it. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is the bottle it is in. I have small hands and it does get hard to hold and squeeze some lotion out because it&#x27;s a short but wide bottle. I will definitely be trying the other JWOWW lotions because this is my favorite lotion i&#x27;ve used ever.</li>
            <li> Love it!! I could tell the first time I used it that I had a lil bit of color to me.I also like the smell of it.</li>
            <li> I only gave it 4 stars because i think it is a little weak on the bronzing but it did help give me color and not burn at all. It smells nice and is more of a thick type of lotion (some come out watery). I like her brand and want to try another one. But all in all good buy. Great price and did what i needed :)</li>
            <li> Love this product! when i walked into the salon with this product i also saw they were selling it, for 25 dollars MORE!! it works great and i am very very pleased with the price</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and works great!</li>
            <li> Great color in minimal time. I also love the smell. Very happy with this purchase. Can also be used in natural sun.</li>
            <li> I was not pleased with the results. Used for a week and could not see a difference.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference when using this, wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> Smelled great.&lt;br /&gt;Good Quantity.&lt;br /&gt;Im 1/2 italian so i don&#x27;t burn easy to begin with so i can&#x27;t say it will help you not burn. Though i never got burned while using this lotion inside. It&#x27;s definitely not recommended to be used as an outside lotion. I got a natural looking tan. Not orange at all and tanning lines weren&#x27;t there. It coats evenly and smells good but smell doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> Very nice scent even after tanning. The bronzer does seem to stay on even after a shower, unlike some that just rinse off. I still prefer the Wedding White I purchased last year but now it is soooo expensive, much more than I paid last year.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it yet, but it expired this month, you can tell someone squeezed some out of it since there was spill over on the cap on the inside, just annoying they can sell expired products on here. received it quickly, but am annoyed it&#x27;s expired! check the sell dates before you buy tanning products on here.</li>
            <li> Just got this lotion and im extremely disappointed it expired last month it had great reviews but im not happy!</li>
            <li> This is stuff Is awful. I burned every time I tanned for 2 weeks straight like bad. Like blisters bad. Stopped using it and tanning for a few weeks bought a different lotion and tanned like normal. It was thrown away immediately</li>
            <li> This is the best tanning lotion I&#x27;ve ever used, I&#x27;ve tanned twice and already I see a difference. I would recommend this to any indoor tanner. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this from the tanning salon though since it&#x27;s about $30 more from the salons. I will buy this on amazon again.</li>
            <li> You might as well use Jergens! 2 thumbs down! I couldn&#x27;t tell one bit of difference.</li>
            <li> Great price for this! Suntan City wanted to charge me $80 for a bottle, but this was a much better deal.</li>
            <li> I like the bronzer, it offers moisture and I enjoy the smell</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful! Today was my first day to tan! I don&#x27;t feel greasy or oily like some lotions I&#x27;ve used in the past. Has a mild sweet scent to it and goes on very easy!  Thank you Allure Tanning Salons and Spa for your quick shipment in delivery! I give you 5 stars! What was suppose to take 10 days shipping took 4!</li>
            <li> works really great! I loved it! I started looking darker right away! Smells good too! U really must try it!</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  Not so hot on the body but a great tanner.  I love the smell of the lotion and how easy it went on and stayed on during the summer days of lazing in the sun.</li>
            <li> This lotion is amazing! It makes your skin soft and it tans really well. I find myself not having to go as often because it tans so dark, quickly. I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Lotion is better than expected. Huge bottle applies smoothly and smells fantastic! Can be used inside or out. Great value!</li>
            <li> Not a good tanning lotion it&#x27;s awful it makes you orange it don&#x27;t deserve a star but had to mark one or it would not let me submit</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using this line of tanning products. I would recommend her tanning lotions to anyone. Each new line that comes out has something ever better!!</li>
            <li> This lotion is awesome! It smells great and doesn&#x27;t leave that &amp;#34; I&#x27;ve just burned my skin by bulbs&amp;#34;  smell after your tanning as well. I have used it 3 times and noticed a difference right away. I couldn&#x27;t get over that &amp;#34; plateau&amp;#34; and this did it for me! For this price I would order it again and again!</li>
            <li> Was here much sooner than expected, love this tanning lotion!</li>
            <li> This is some of the best tanning lotion I&#x27;ve gotten in a while.  I&#x27;m not fair skinned by any means, but only a couple times tanning and I got really dark. I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I have several tanning products, but the Jwoww Black Bronzer is my most used product. Not only does it smell great, you can use it as an outdoor tanning lotion as well. Indoors or outdoors you&#x27;ll get a great tan with this one.</li>
            <li> Im a real blonde very fair..this works well for me</li>
            <li> Love this tanning loation. Gives you a good color and not too much bronzer if that is the look you are going for</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping! My lotion came in 3 days! Coming from the west to east coast that&#x27;s impressive! I even got a free sample for another lotion &amp; a coupon! I&#x27;ll be buying from Sunless Deals again &amp; again! Keep up the good work! :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so upset I bought this! Totally fake no bronzer at all just crap lotion</li>
            <li> DEFINITELY FAKE ! I have had the real one it is NOT MADE BY Australian Gold..This did nothing to help me tan</li>
            <li> Very high quality lotion at a bargain price...don&#x27;t waste your money on the expensive ones...this one is just as good or better</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite lotion. Its the best bronzer lotion I&#x27;ve tried. Great price too. It smells amazing and gets me so dark every time. I will definitely recommend this!</li>
            <li> I go tanning  infrequently, but thought I&#x27;d try this lotion this time.  Don&#x27;t really notice difference between this lotion and other I&#x27;ve tried in the past.  Did not get burned, but nothing special.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite tanning bronzer that I have tried.  It doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling greasy, nor does it have an upleasant smell.  It is very nice.  I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d try this lotion since I see it in the salon at a much higher cost.  It is a thick brown cream.  The smell out of the bottle is ok but after I tan my family says it stinks really bad.  I do see color results, but not as dark as what I would like.  It doesn&#x27;t turn my hands orange, and I was worried about that, since I cannot wash my hands after applying when I tan at the salon.  I haven&#x27;t tried to use this outside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is ok for the price, but I am not sure I would purchase this particular product again.  I may try another JWOWW product to see how it fairs.</li>
            <li> i had tried a packet of the jwow black bronzer at my local tanning salon, i loved the color it gave me and i didn&#x27;t notice and orangeiness, so i decided to buy it. and i was not going to pay $60 + for this lotion. so i found it here on amazon. the shipping was fast, the package was sealed, and there were not dents or dings. but i had noticed most people who reviewed this had said it was watery or expired. i received my bottle 2 days before it expired, but the consistency was creamy so i don&#x27;t know what they are talking about.it being expired is not a big deal to me; i got it for a third of the price at the salon and i found it worked the same as packet at the salon. i like this lotion, i&#x27;m not a fanatic about it, but i don&#x27;t hate it. it gives me a great color, doesn&#x27;t turn me orange, not streaky, and the smell is okay kinda perfumey, but no big deal. i would defiantly buy this again. i am loving the color it gives me, nice golden brown! the only reason i gave it 4 star was because it was expired.</li>
            <li> Once I had received open and used this product I realized that it was due to expire,  was very disappointed!</li>
            <li> I have fair complexion and was worried that this may be too dark and be visible on my skin.  However, it was the opposite.  It is very natural looking, doesn&#x27;t have a strong odor, goes on evenly, and moisturizes well.  I was very satisfied with the product and received it as promised.</li>
            <li> This product was right on with what I needed. I haven&#x27;t tanned in years &amp; I researched similar products &amp; this stood out to me. It has good scent &amp; worked great on my fair skin. Definitely consider this JWOWW Black Bronzer if your looking for quick results. LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work at all --------------------- I&#x27;m tan and it didn&#x27;t do crap to improve where I was, will never repurchase</li>
            <li> I had purchased another tanning lotion but just didn&#x27;t seem to really be getting any darker. Switched to this one and in just a few sessions I noticed a big difference in how much darker I was getting. Also makes my skin feel incredibly smooth.</li>
            <li> I really liked this product.  It went on well and was not greasy.  Kept my skin soft.  My tan looked great.  The price was awesome and it was shipped on time just as I was told.</li>
            <li> This is the worst ive ever used and ive been tanning for years!  Blocked the hair folicals on my legs which gave me chicken skin,not to mention it did nothing to help my color. Stay away from it!-1 star</li>
            <li> After using almost the full bottle of this I can say I am very pleased. It definetely makes the tanning experience much faster! I am a guy and I still use this regardless of the scent, but my girlfriend she LOVES the smell of this stuff on her much more than some of the ones she has tried. This product also doesn&#x27;t tingle which I like, so no more looking like a lobster. The only thing I can say that is kind of sketchy about the product is it did not come sealed or plastic wrapped, not sure if the ones at the salon are or not. But overall very pleased!</li>
            <li> good lotion for tanning</li>
            <li> Bday gift for the wife, she really love how it feels on her skin and says &amp;#34;no other tanning lotion can compare&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Expired!!!!!!!! Not happy!</li>
            <li> This lotion worked really well for me. It was the first bottle I bought when I started tanning.  By the end of the bottle I was really dark. Smells good too even after Im done tanning.</li>
            <li> Love it!! Came on time well packaged sealed. Smells great! Mine isn&#x27;t watery at all and has the original signature on the back. Will update when used as of now well pleased!! 💜💜</li>
            <li> This product smells amazing, unlike most tanning lotions. It works fairy well for the price. Would recommend to a beginner with tanning.</li>
            <li> This is the exact product as the one in the tanning salons. i was skeptical at first to buy through Amazon, but i recommend it for everyone. My sister and I got 2 bottles for under $50 with shipping, can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
            <li> dont waste your money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but then again, I never tan if im in a bed anyways, I only tan if I get real UV rays outside.. so im probably not the best person to take advice from.</li>
            <li> I have fair skin and with the other tanning lotions I would just turn red and that would be it. With JWOWW&#x27;s tanning lotion though, I noticed a difference the day I used it. I absolutely love the smell. It&#x27;s as good or better than anything twice its price.</li>
            <li> I work at a tanning salon and recently purchased Jwoww Black Bronzer. It had good bronzer results and smelled great before and after the session. No bad after tan scent like some lotions! Recommending to my clients daily! Need to have a base tan before you&#x27;ll see desired results.</li>
            <li> I just started to use it and I can already see a difference! It is the best and will continue to use it everytime I tan.</li>
            <li> This supplier was awesome. My tanning lotion can fast and they even sent me free samples along with the bottle.</li>
            <li> I really liked this product.   I have used various tanning products in the past and nothing made me want to buy another bottle. First thing I loved about this product was the smell, I find myself smelling my tanning lotion even when I&#x27;m not tanning (yes, I am a dork).  I loved how easy it was apply and it rub it smoothly and evenly without me having to constantly keep rubbing it in.  I loved the color it produces - it&#x27;s beautiful - tan without looking insanely dark. I&#x27;d definitely recommend to anyone looking to have a gorgeous tan color.</li>
            <li> i just bought this lotion today and iam so much darker!!! it smells so good and it doesnt leave that nasty smell on you when you get out the tanning bed!!! i love it!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Although I had to wait FOREVER for this to arrive because of a back ordering issue, I have to say that this product was worth the wait!  The scent is very light(extremely important to me) and you don&#x27;t smell like a tanning bed after using it.  The consistency is also great...not too thick and not too thin...goes on well and soaks in  just enough making my naturally dry skin silky smooth.  The tan that this product has helped me achieve is very natural looking, but PLENTY dark.  I am a fair skinned girl who doesn&#x27;t tan that easily, but JWOWW has definitely helped me get dark.  I have had SO many compliments on my color and everyone thinks I have been on vacation.  I just keep telling them, \\&quot;If you can&#x27;t go to the beach, you might as well look like you&#x27;ve been to one!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> The smell was very nice before, during, and after tanning. Beyond that, I was not impressed. Instead of feeling soft and silky the lotion felt sticky and slightly oily. It is misleading to label this lotion as a &#x27;black&#x27; bronzer since the color is more of a burnt orange after tanning. Also, the shade was not as dark as some of the other reviews had lead me to believe prior to purchase. Ultimately, what you are paying for is the name and a pretty perfume scent.</li>
            <li> This product gets you the fastest darkest tan ever!!!! I have had many others but this is the best !!!</li>
            <li> I am not an avid tanner, I go a little bit before summer to give me a base tan and even out the lines from the previous summer. When I first went I used a lotion my sister gave me an it worked pretty good but I ran out and bought a sample of this at my gym. This product worked wonders. I have red hair so Im on the paler side of things but this product made me so tan after the first use! Definitely will be buying this product again!</li>
            <li> LOVE this product.  Delivered within specified time frame</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is the real deal. Smells different. Feels different. Bottle looks different. Not seeing as good of results.</li>
            <li> One of my favs!  Nice bronzer but not too much that you look orange!!!!</li>
            <li> Works ok, not as good as I expected but ok.</li>
            <li> I bought this product when I bought my other JWOWW lotion in the pink bottle and figured it would be just as amazing, but unfortunately it was not as good. The smell was fruity but the orange smell was over powering... My skin was still soft after using this product but it didnt get me my fast tan that the JWOWW in the Pink Bottle did. It was just an OK tan.... if your looking for a light tan this is the product to go with.</li>
            <li> This is a good lotion, but truly isn&#x27;t any better than other lotions in its price range. I paid about $20 for it, and consider it worth the money. However, I would not recommend paying more for this lotion (as in a salon).</li>
            <li> Got it in the mail today smells amazing. applied alittle to my forearm to see if the bronzer was streaky. i can tell the bronzer is there but its not orange. can&#x27;t wait to start tanning with it</li>
            <li> My fiance purchased this for me for my birthday recently; I had read a lot of reviews and it sounded great - IT IS.  I am biracial but on the light side so I like to tan.  Who doesn&#x27;t love a summery bronze look?? ;)  I do tan easily but wanted something to intesify it.  I am so happy with this product. It is true that the scent is amazing and even walking to my car after tanning I can smell it. NO TANNING BED SKIN SMELL!  That was a big thing for me. I was noticeably darker right after tanning and of course for the rest of the day I kept looking in the mirror as I was getting darker, lol. I will definitely purchase this lotion again :)</li>
            <li> I am not happy, it barely works I see hardly no difference and there is nothing dark about the bronzer, this is my first Australian gold product and I will be sticking to designer skin from now on</li>
            <li> Love this bronzer. I have used this before and knew it would be what I was looking for in a bronzer.</li>
            <li> smells great and is not greasy or sticky</li>
            <li> OMG I loved it! My skin is hard to take color and this bronzer was the solution. Now everybody flatter my cinnamon sexy skin color. I&#x27;m so happy with it.</li>
            <li> you do get a great tan. no doubt</li>
            <li> This is BY FAR the BEST tanning lotion I have EVER used! It does not have a bad smell-- doesn&#x27;t smell like heaven but it&#x27;s still not bad at all. You can get this in salons for over $70.00 so this is a STEAL!! I recommend this to anyone and everyone who tans - whether you are a beginner or expert level tanner. I&#x27;ve tried almost ever lotion out there and have been disappointed but this exceeded my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To the reviewers out there that say they experienced streaks- I definitely have not. I was white as a ghost and started out with this (as I have before) and the results are truly amazing. I&#x27;ve never had any problems with this. As long as it&#x27;s ever on the market, I will buy it. And I will NEVER buy anything else. It doesn&#x27;t fade-- it&#x27;s wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seller shipped quickly and like I said, this is seriously a STEAL!!</li>
            <li> Smells awesome isn&#x27;t sticky great quick color. I&#x27;m impressed in the quality of this product considering it came from a jersey shore girl. Love it!</li>
            <li> I was totally skeptical with a reality star tanning lotion but it&#x27;s honestly awesome. Smells good, goes on nice and works great. I got a nice brown color and didn&#x27;t get any pink like I usually do. Made my skin look really nice. Definitely worth trying!!</li>
            <li> So I was nervous about purchasing lotion online because I know some people who have received baby lotion instead of the real stuff. I ordered this lotion late Sunday night after 11pm and I just received it on Tuesday at noon!! So shipping was amazing!! Best part of it all is that its the REAL LOTION!!! I cannot wait to use it :)</li>
            <li> Jwoww is WOW!!!  This is the best Black Bronzer ever. It feels so smooth on your skin also.  I have the darkest tan I have had in MANY years and I am hard to tan! Recommend this to everyone!</li>
            <li> I just got this lotion in the mail and used it for the first time and I am thinking this is going to be a great lotion for my rotation! It smells great and leaves your skin feeling refreshed! I will be buying it agin on here and not at the salon for the $70 price tag!</li>
            <li> I decided to try this tanning lotion because of all the good reviews and all I can say is WOWW!! seriously! LOL I am very fair skinned and it normally takes a long time for me to develop a tan and I have now gone twice, 7 mins the first day and 9 the second and I have had FOUR people ask me if I&#x27;ve been tanning!! that NEVER happens after 2 visits! I have never has results like this!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is real indoor tanning lotion, used it in tanning bed and started itching and burned. I think it was either expired or something. I have always tanned with no issues and as soon as I tried this, I started having a bad reaction.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about ordering the tanning lotion online but with the unbelievable prices at my tanning salon (this bottle would&#x27;ve cost me $70!) I decided to try it. I was using a lotion without bronzer and saw no results but I saw results after my first session with this lotion. It smells like berries and doesn&#x27;t leave an oily layer on the skin after tanning. People I know comment all the time on how dark I am and I seriously owe it to this lotion!</li>
            <li> Im naturally medium light. After one use, Im about 2shades darker. Currently at a medium dark. Smell is pleasant and light. Even after tanning my skin smelled great. Not like other tanning lotions, that make you smell burnt. Texture is nice, is light and moisturing.I absolutely recommend.</li>
            <li> I first tried this lotion as a sample and fell in love right away!! It left me with a dark, deep tan. It also smelled good and didnt leave me feeling all nasty. Order online though because it is double the price in the shops. I will continue ording this lotion through Amazon!!!</li>
            <li> Worst tanning lotion I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li> i was not very happy about how it didnt tan my skin. i found it to look like a different bottle then in salons.</li>
            <li> Just purchased this bronzing lotion a few weeks ago. I really like the smell, it doesn&#x27;t have that weird \\&quot;tanning\\&quot; smell, and it leaves your skin feeling really silky. I haven&#x27;t used a ton of tanning lotions, but this one seems to get my skin a great bronze color, and quickly. I would definetly repurchase this lotion.</li>
            <li> I love this new lotion, it smells great, the bronzer is amazing!! I love, love, love it! Great Purchase! Highly Recomended.</li>
            <li> I am happy with the Amazon price of this. One issue: the decorative clear lid will fall off. This has happend to a friend and myself. The golden lid will stay secure, so your lotion will not be compromised. I like the scent and the feel of the product. Personally, I need to wash my face well after use, because the moisturizer is a bit much for my skin type, but that is common for me. I&#x27;d buy it again!</li>
            <li> I love Jwoww tanning lotion it smells nice and gives a great color.  I received the Jwoww tanning lotion on time.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel it helps be get as dark a tan as my other bronzers. But the price was good so I&#x27;ll use it until it&#x27;s gone.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this item worked</li>
            <li> Definitely helped me bronze in the tanning bed! Will buy this again</li>
            <li> love it! been using this lotion for 3 years now &amp; I used to buy it at the salons for around 60$ a bottle! Now I buy it from sunless deals on amazon I paid 69$ total for 4 bottles &amp; shipping! It&#x27;s the exact same as you&#x27;d buy at the salon.</li>
            <li> I thought the price was too good to be true. This bottle had an expiration date of 5/2014. I also purchased another bottle which expired 1/2014. I will only make future lotion purchases from the salon!!!</li>
            <li> Best bronzing lotion I&#x27;ve used so far.  DEFINATELY THE BEST SMELLING!! Even after tanning!  Will take you past your tanning plateau too!  Makes my skin so soft!</li>
            <li> My daughter &amp; I use it and it seems to work pretty well. I may try something with a little bit darker bronzer but over all we were satisfied with the results it gives for a starter</li>
            <li> I believe the lotion I got is fake. I have been an avid tanner for about 7 years &amp; I have tried all sorts of lotions. The consistency of this lotion is watery &amp; there is no \\&quot;berry\\&quot; smell, but a light perfume like smell. Putting it on my face, it felt like Vaseline. The back of my lotion where JWOW&#x27;s signature is her name in full cursive. On the Amazon items display photo, it is just a large pink \\&quot;J\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My local tanning salon has limited lotions so I am not able to compare lotions. I will stop by in a tanning store later &amp; compare, &amp; of course, I will always update my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***This lotion DOES NOT expire. The date on the bottom is the batch number &amp; manufacture date. I have confirmed this with Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I am wrong about anything I have said above, I really would like to know. I asked a question of knowing how to tell if the product is authentic or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Like all my reviews, I&#x27;m not looking to argue or point fingers. Of course I&#x27;m upset that I believe the item I received is fake, but that is what replies are for! Thanks guys.</li>
            <li> awesome product! fast shipping.</li>
            <li> this lotion is kind thick. ive used almost the entire bottle &amp; i am really tan. but i tan 30-45 minutes . three times a week, i know not healthy . but this lotion works very well . Ive never been orange , it smells amazing before &amp; doesn&#x27;t stink after.</li>
            <li> no issues smells nice</li>
            <li> I am a pale girl, and this is the only product I have used that actually works for me!! :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a frequent tanner, I have used snookie tanning lotion in the past so I thought I would give this a try. Has a nice smell and doesn&#x27;t leave a orange or bronze looking after tone</li>
            <li> I did like this a lot! Would buy again!</li>
            <li> 100%. Satisfied. Ordered the lotion Tuesday evening &amp; it arrived Thursday(I selected 5 day shipping and still got it in 2 days) Nicely packaged and lotion still sealed in plastic. Also the lotion smells great, and gives you a nice bronzed color! Will be ordering again 😀</li>
            <li> I bough this lotion from Amazon because it was about half the price of my local tanning salon.  I mainly purchased this lotion because 1) other reviewers said it didn&#x27;t leave that \\&quot;tanning bed smell\\&quot; and 2) I was looking for a lotion to help me get a dark tan quickly.  Unfortunately this product still left that weird tanning bed smell so I would recommend showering within a couple hours after tanning.  As far as this lotion helping me get dark, it has helped me develop a nice base tan but I was expecting it to help me get much darker.  Overall a decent lotion but I will probably order the Australian Gold Gelee once this one is gone because it&#x27;s not worth the price (which has gone up since I ordered my lotion about a month ago).</li>
            <li> Love this lotion! Its by far my favorite and you get it SO much cheaper then in the tanning salon! The place I go tried charging $75 and I got it here for $20! Prompt delivery also! No complaints!</li>
            <li> This bronzer smells great not overpowering like they can be sometimes. I like to mix it with my Insanley Dark tingle lotion to get both effects at once. This bronzer is a good bronzer but doesn&#x27;t make you super dark really quick like some reviews claim, but is a great product for a great price. Bottom line...I love it and would purchase again plus this is the cheapest I found it so that&#x27;s a plus too</li>
            <li> I received my order the next day and I went and used it wow it made me dark on top of my already dark tan. It smell great too. If ur dark and want to b darker buy this you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery,  no problems</li>
            <li> Smells okay then after u use it u stink but I think it be okay for first time tanners</li>
            <li> Works Great! GREAT PRICE!!!</li>
            <li> Worked great and nice smell</li>
            <li> Wow!  This really works well in an Extreme tanning bed.. Instant browning... no burn</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price. I&#x27;m usually pretty cheap and just go to walmart and get a $10 tanning lotion, but they never really worth. I used this only once so far and I can already tell the difference it made. Very even tan, can&#x27;t wait to keep using this.&lt;br /&gt;Jwoww&#x27;s where it&#x27;s at :)</li>
            <li> This product truly sucks! I received it in July 2014 and was really excited to get it cheaper since it&#x27;s usually my favorite. IT&#x27;S SO FAKE! guarantee they just loaded it with sunscreen. Ingredients in a different order, logo different size, smells like nothing on the skin, and no bronzers. Truly a horrible product. I should&#x27;ve listened to the 1 star people. It sucks having to waste money at the salon but apparently there&#x27;s evil people out there that don&#x27;t care about the quality of a product!</li>
            <li> Works very fast to give you a darker tan and it&#x27;s not smelly</li>
            <li> I like it! You have to have a base tan though otherwise you wont get any darker. It smells good both my boyfriend and I agree. It didn&#x27;t take but a few days to get it.. I was pretty surprised by that usually everything takes a week plus to receive. Jwow defiantly has a plus in my book.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other bronzers to help tan but jwoww was the best I noticed after 1 use the difference in my skin color. It wasn&#x27;t greasy afterwards and it didn&#x27;t have a bad after tan smell. I love it!!!! I won&#x27;t use anything other tanning lotion again!!!</li>
            <li> First of all, I NEVER take the time to write reviews about products, but I felt I absolutely had to about this one. I have been indoor tanning for about 4 years now, and this is by far the best product I have EVER used!! About 6 tans in to my new tanning salon, I felt like I wasn&#x27;t getting any darker. I usually tan really well naturally, but who has time out lay out for an hour every day? I was a little discouraged. So I went to my favorite online store AMAZON and searched for tanning lotions, and selected the \\&quot;most popular\\&quot; option to sort them. At first I was skeptical, like people were only buying the product because some reality show star&#x27;s name was on it, but I decided to try it anyway. Ordered it on Monday, got it this morning (Wednesday) went straight to the tanning salon and came out AT LEAST 3 shades darker. I am now a HUGE fan of damn JWOWW haha. But in all seriousness, this lotion really does its job, gets you way darker than any other lotions I&#x27;ve tried, and plus it smells great before and after you tan! (I can&#x27;t stand smelling like burning flesh after tanning). I would definitely recommend giving this lotion a try! And like I said, I never write reviews for anything, but this product definitely deserved a great review!</li>
            <li> Im a light Latino... So I naturally get a great tan. But, JWOWW makes it even more amazing. I really love it! I&#x27;d say if def gives no orangy fake bake look. My mother-in-law can&#x27;t help but, to lose her cheap stuff so she swing by here and grab my JWOWW. No joke. I know it&#x27;s no accident.</li>
            <li> Awesome scent that doesn&#x27;t faded! You can tell a difference in the first use! Indoor and outdoor! Will buy again</li>
            <li> great product!  great seller and service!  I&#x27;ll be buying again! :)</li>
            <li> Does not provide a dark tan s described I would not purchase again !! Wil not purchase again. I am a very disappointed customer ....</li>
            <li> I love the lotion!  Its just as described by the seller.  I am an &#x27;experienced&#x27; tanner and tan in the &#x27;high&#x27; level beds.  It smells great before and AFTER tanning.  It goes on smoothly and a little goes a long way!  It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or oily. I would even consider tanning then going to do other things after because it doesn&#x27;t smell bad or feel oily.  I had a pretty good color before using the product, and its even better after tanning!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this lotion for $60+ at salons for a couple of years now, and I&#x27;m so glad I came across this! It&#x27;s the same lotion, I can assure you, that you will find at the salons. It came with its original seal that even salons take off before selling. As far as the lotion itself, it&#x27;s my favorite out of all the ones I&#x27;ve tried. You can tell after one session, and it&#x27;s not one that will leave lotion marks on your hands and feet. My most recent lotion was Black Noir and I didn&#x27;t get nearly the results as I did with JWOWW&#x27;s Australian Gold. I would recommend this lotion to anyone who is wanting a quick and natural looking tan. Just in time for Halloween :)</li>
            <li> Item is just as described. It smells good &amp; I have used it a few times. My daughter tried it out since she watches the show and she loved it, she put an SPF lotion on first and then this on top of it &amp; got some color.</li>
            <li> Smells good besides I just got it in the mail yesterday and it expired over a year ago....hope I still get the same results.</li>
            <li> I have been using for about a week now and this has given me a good base color. Not as strong as I thought it would be, but it does give a natural tan look and it helps tan my legs which do not tan normally in natural sunlight or tanning beds. Overall it is a good product.</li>
            <li> I was not overally impressed.  I had used a much cheaper product than this and was much happier with the end results of it over this product.  I am rating tihs lower due to the fact that it just isnt that good of a deal for the cost.</li>
            <li> Not as good as little black bronzer</li>
            <li> Totally love this product! Smells great,works great amazing price here on amazon!</li>
            <li> After reading some of the excellent reviews on here, I HAD to purchase this lotion to find out for myself! The bronzing feature of the lotion is alright. I&#x27;m an \\&quot;experienced tanner\\&quot;, so I prefer a lotion that has 75x bronzing agents in it &amp; that&#x27;s probably why I am not \\&quot;WOWW-ed\\&quot; with this particular one. The scent is another feature that was \\&quot;hyped up\\&quot; in reviews on this site. After reading several reviews stating that I will love the scent, I couldn&#x27;t wait to pop off the cap and start smelling! However, I was incredibly disappointed when I realized that I have purchased yet another lotion that smells like hair dye. Needless to say, the scent of this is not my cup of tea. Overall, while I think that the lotion will give me a slight color boost, I&#x27;m not very impressed. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be buying another bottle of JWOWW&#x27;s lotion in the future.</li>
            <li> This lotion did not meet my standards at all. While it did make my skin pretty soft I did not get tan. I actually lost some of the tan I had. Never again. Waste of money. I gave this product a fair chance.               I used it 8 times or more. Throwing it out the second I receive my GOOD lotion in the mail.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t even smell like the Jwoww lotion. I&#x27;ve bought the same thing at a salon. I feel like I got some out of date or watered down defective bottle. Don&#x27;t buy it!</li>
            <li> I would have never guessed that this was a BRONZER lotion.  The bronzer was the main reason I wanted the lotion being I don&#x27;t tan easily.  Disappointed in the product...</li>
            <li> Never tanned before. I decided to try tanning and researched and read all reviews before deciding to purchase JWoww&#x27;s Tanning Lotion. It smells great and works even better! I was very pleased with the color I got from the very first tanning session.</li>
            <li> Just started tanning again it&#x27;s been a long time I do notice my color coming out a lot but I feel once I take a shower it comes  off but for the price it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> It was better than ok. I expected it to be cheap looking and used but it was new and after I compared it to the ones in the tanning place I felt like I made an awesome deal!</li>
            <li> I had no issues with the product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this bronzer a few times and pretty satisfied with the result -  I get a nice even tone faster</li>
            <li> Always loved this tanning lotion. Achieves a great bronze color. I alternate this one with her &amp;#34;One and Done&amp;#34; lotion.</li>
            <li> This stuff makes me tan instantly and I&#x27;m not sure why. I have very fair skin; however, when I want to get a decent tan going for the summer, all I need to do is use this lotion and tan one or two times before I already begin to get some color. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s solely the lotion or if my skin just tans that easily. But I never, ever go to the tanning bed without putting some of this on. I apply it generously - I don&#x27;t over do it - just enough to soak into my skin and feel good. It helps to give me a nice golden brown color - not read or too dark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this for fair skin as long as you are used to tanning and know how well or difficult it is for you to get color from the tanning bed.</li>
            <li> i own a tanning bed, so i tan a lot. this lotion sucked. i will not buy again, i see no results from it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will purchase again:&lt;br /&gt;Millenium Tanning New Paint It Black Auto-darkening Dark Tanning Lotion, 50X, 13.5-Ounce or&lt;br /&gt;Millenium Tanning New Solid Black Bronzer Tanning Bed Lotion, 100x, 13.5-Ounce</li>
            <li> So I was superrrr excited to try Jwowws tanning lotion, come to find out it&#x27;s a total waste. :/ I&#x27;ve used it 3 times now and I&#x27;m still pale, I thought bronzer makes u at least bronze but nope...guess it doesn&#x27;t work on real white skin. I wanna try Snookis lotion but I think it&#x27;ll be the same as this one. Bummer!</li>
            <li> It smells very good but why does it smell identical to Australian gold Sinfully Black?&lt;br /&gt;The tanning lotion is O.k but I would NOT re-purchased again! OMG the bottle is super hard to squeeze out the lotion nearly impossible, The shipping was fast though arrived to Kansas in 2 days (Prime member)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been tanning since I was 16 and I&#x27;m 19 now and during that time I have used sooo many lotions such as&lt;br /&gt;Worship me, Tao, Aphrodisiac, Luminary, White 2 Black, Going GAGA, Sinfully Black, Paint it black, Insanely Black-Tingle, Black storm, Pure Harmony, Verture, Berrylicious, Sun Skin Spa, Steamy conffesions, and some others I can&#x27;t remember the names and if you want a GREAT LOTION PLEASE GO FOR STEAMY CONFESSIONS IT WILL TAN YOU LIKE YOU&#x27;VE BEEN TANNING NEXT TO THE SUN!!</li>
            <li> I bought this product almost 2 years ago so I&#x27;m not real sure why Amazon is just now asking me to rate it but it was ok. For what I paid for it, it worked fine but definetly not one of the top Bronzer&#x27;s that I have used for indoor tanning</li>
            <li> I used to only use this product when I went to the tanning salon. It gives results quickly and works very well but I wouldn&#x27;t go as far to say it&#x27;s the best I have ever used. It gives you a dark tan and doesn&#x27;t leave you with orange palms. It has a really great smell to it and isn&#x27;t too thick or too thin. It rubs in well into your skin and makes you feel smooth. The issue to me is price because I have found other products that work just as well as this lotion but is less then half the price of this bottle. I no longer use this product because of price, I refuse to pay so much for a lotion that delivers the same as other cheaper brands.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed anything especially amazing about this product, but I do like it. Smells nice, no orange spots, moisturizes. It was really difficult to squeeze out of the bottle for some reason at first, that was frustrating. Now that I have used some, it is not nearly as difficult. Overall, good product. Only problem now is I&#x27;m not extremely dark.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used Bronzer lotion becuase I have seen so many orange people. Winter is getting me down , so I decided to try Jwoww for fun. I don&#x27;t look orange. I have a nice even natural looking tan. Very plesed!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good if you wana get a tan very fast! I recommend it to everyone i know and they loved it aswell !!</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping got it within a couple of days. I only tan when its spring break time and during the summer. Would recommend this for everyone!!!</li>
            <li> I was expecting more color than I got when I used this, I tried it a few more times because I paid $40 for it and I still wasn&#x27;t really impressed. I don&#x27;t get very dark with it. The smell isn&#x27;t too bad before or after your tan.</li>
            <li> Love it...works really well.&lt;br /&gt;best tan......love the way it helps me get a even tan. all my friends want to try it</li>
            <li> The lotion smells so good and the color after tanning looks pretty natural. I use it at least five times a week and it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> This is a great lotion. I tanned really fast and I have a really nice tan. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The lotion arrived in ample amount if time. It is exactly what I ordered, I have used the product in the past straight from the salon and it is the exact same thing!</li>
            <li> This is the best tanning lotion that I have&lt;br /&gt; ever owned. It smells amazing and feels great. It isn&#x27;t greasy or sticky. It goes on silky and smooth. It is an excellent price. I noticed a difference in my skin color even after the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> My tanning salon tried to tell me that the products from amozon were fake but as soon as i got it i test it the lotion against theirs and it was the same exact thing. i would so recomended it. the smell is to die for and i notice a change on my first time using it!!! it was an automatic bronze!</li>
            <li> I just tried this today after being so excited about it.  It left me blotchy with a triangle shaped white patch on my neck.  There were also untanned white patches on my body.  I told the manager of the tanning place who was shocked.  As it turns out she said a lot of frauds use the bottle and half the product.  I think this might be the case.  I guess it&#x27;s back to my authentic tanning lotions at the salon!!!!</li>
            <li> GREAT SHIPPEMENT TIME</li>
            <li> I can not easily tan but with this product I achieve the color I want with in couple of tanning session. It smells good too.</li>
            <li> This lotion works well and doesn&#x27;t smell bad. I would recommend it for people who don&#x27;t like a strong smelling tanning lotion but good results for indoor tanning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very picky with my tanning lotions, but this one just worked SO well. The smell isn&#x27;t super strong, but it&#x27;s just right. You also don&#x27;t end up smelling weird after you get out of the bed. You&#x27;ll definitely see a difference the first time you use it. So happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I have pretty fair skin and it takes me a while to start building a tan. This product did WONDERS on my skin. I had immediate results and it looked even better the next day. I would definitely recommend this product, especially if you want maximum results for minimum tanning sessions!</li>
            <li> Great tanning lotion been using for bout 2 weeks now and before I was pail white I now have some color!</li>
            <li> Love this lotion. It didn&#x27;t smell AS good as I remembered but it still smells better than most and for what it&#x27;s actually for it does very well. Darkens you nicely over time!</li>
            <li> It was alright. Good buying experience</li>
            <li> Good lotion, personally - I&#x27;m not a fan of the smell, but it isn&#x27;t a deal breaker. (It&#x27;s not a bad smell, I just don&#x27;t like it)</li>
            <li> I had used this lotion once in the salon and it was amazing! So I ordered it From amazon. And when I got it .. it smelled different. I used it one time anyways thinking it had been awhile and maybe it was just me but the lotion was awful!!!!! I&#x27;m totally convinced that the lotion was a cheap fake. It wasn&#x27;t sealed and I was so disappointed I ended up throwing the crap away! Never ever order from this seller! There totally bogus!!! Rip off!!!!</li>
            <li> This was a great beginner lotion. Once you&#x27;re at a certain darkness though it doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well. The smell is great! I would say for beginners this is the lotion to get.</li>
            <li> Product was out of date when received. Definitely less expensive than purchasing at the tanning salon. Likely due to it&#x27;s expiration date. Made me break out in a rash!</li>
            <li> I just recently used Jwoww&#x27;s lotion and I can say it was a pretty great lotion. It went on very smoothly and it smells really really good, and last a long time after your out of the tanning bed. The only thing I can say is the darkness didn&#x27;t last that long after the tan. I took a shower 6 hours later and the darkness was gone by the next day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a tanning lotion connoisseur, so this seems to be good enough for what I need, a tanning boost. I purchased it because it was the right price to get free shipping with my purchase of tanning goggles. I&#x27;m not in to all the Jersey Shore hype. I bought it because it was from a reputable company. It doesn&#x27;t make me break out, which is probably the most important. It has a decent smell, not anything special. It has a good consistency and applies easily and evenly. I&#x27;d buy this tanning lotion again; it does the job.</li>
            <li> It works ok, I still see a difference for sure from other bottles of same Jwoww product I purchased elsewhere. The color, smell and effectiveness is definitely different.</li>
            <li> I just started tanning about a month ago and have been using Sweedish Beauty triple bronzer and I wasnt tanning at all so I looked for something new and found this Im very light abd its hard for me to tan I used this just once and already see a difference in color. It smells great! I ordered this Saturday and received on Friday. Nicely packaged. Will definately buy again!</li>
            <li> I dont feel like this product works as well as it says it is suppose too. i have been using it for just about a month and only see little difference.</li>
            <li> JWOWW is a nice tanning lotion. It goes on easy and doesn&#x27;t stay on top. Goes right into the skin. Nice stuff.</li>
            <li> This lotion is wonderful. It isn&#x27;t overwhelming with a nasty odor! Even after tanning. A nice thick lotion too, and a lot cheaper than at the salon! Would use again!!!</li>
            <li> I loved the smell of it and it does work to a certain point.. it doesn&#x27;t really get the job done if you wanna get REALLY tan</li>
            <li> I do like this product.  It is very moisturizing and smells nice.  I am a year long tanner, so I am always looking for diff lotions.  This one is very nice!</li>
            <li> It works OK.  Nothing special.</li>
            <li> Very strong , broke me out</li>
            <li> Product was as advertised, good buy. Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  I&#x27;ve purchased 2 bottles already.</li>
            <li> Like this product a lot, doesn&#x27;t smell bad, smells pretty good actually. Shipped quickly. The round part of the cap did come off of the other part of the cap within the first couple uses for some reason..</li>
            <li> First, I love the way this stuff smells before and after tanning. It doesnt leave you smelling burnt like some lotions. Also, I am very light skinned and after only one week I could tell a huge difference and I was only getting in one of those older style tanning beds! I was definately very satisfied with this purchase</li>
            <li> I expected more from this lotion considering the high reviews and publicity. It took 4 sessions to notice a difference. I had a base tan already and it has only increased my color slightly. I tan easy so not sure what the problem was. Will not be buying this brand again.</li>
            <li> The ratings on this were very good and I Love JWOWW so I figured her product had to be good. Compared with other bronzing lotions I&#x27;ve used, this does nothing special. I probably wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
            <li> My favorite. I love the smell and the brown tint it leaves. I use this kind every I go tanning</li>
            <li> This lotion work AMAZINGLY. I had very fair skin and within three days of using this I was getting noticeably darker. It smells really good too.</li>
            <li> the product works ok. Im not sure what to exect.why do i have to have ten more words? this is stupid</li>
            <li> Perfect, this tanning lotion was for my husband.  It is the only product he uses to tan his bald head (:</li>
            <li> I AM AMAZED BY THIS PRODUCT!! one time using it and i was completely brown!! and it smells so amazing!!! it smells like fruits which is weird because tanning lotion usually smells horrible!</li>
            <li> My favorite cream!  I don&#x27;t use it at the tanning salon though.  I use it after the shower as a tanning moisturizer.  Works well, tans you and smells awesome.  People are always complimenting me saying how good I smell! I just prefer to use a lotion that has tingle in it when I go tanning, the tingle ones work so much better</li>
            <li> I liked this lotion also . Got a great package deal and was very satisfied with all three products ordered. The prices were great too.Would order again.Received Frankly Scarlet,Jwoww and black . liked them all . Frankly scarlet my favorite .</li>
            <li> I loved this tanning lotion. It gave me great color and didn&#x27;t turn me orange. I would recommend it to anybody!</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t like using bronzers b/c I love tingles.  I wanted to give my skin a break from tingle so I bought this lotion.  I get some color from it, but nothing like the tingles.  It smells good and goes on really nice though!  This lotion would be great for a first time tanner or someone that needs a base tan.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tanned in a couple of years and I decided to start before my wedding so I&#x27;m not the ultra-pasty camera-unfriendly bride. I LOVE THIS PRODUCT. I usually don&#x27;t tan very well, JWOWW&#x27;s  Black Bronzer left me a very nice medium shade after about five uses. For once I am darker than my sister who goes outside white and comes inside looking like a sun goddess while I&#x27;d just burn and peel. Thank you, Australian Gold.</li>
            <li> It is a good lotion. I enjoyed using it . Made my tan come out pretty good. Smells good. Look forward to using more of jwow products</li>
            <li> I love this lotion! As dark as I am I still use it in the tanning salon for at least 10mins and I tell already I look amazing!! Jwoww keep it up! At first I was really curious about this lotion and thought it was &amp;#34;one of those celebrity lotion they are trying to make money and it&#x27;s a rip off&amp;#34; but I guess I was wrong gave it a try and this black bronzer dark blew me away. I will definitely order again!!</li>
            <li> Scent--It smells alright, reminds me of Sinfully Black by Australian Gold.&lt;br /&gt;Results--It&#x27;s a basic black bronzer. It&#x27;ll give you decent color but I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s amazing. I prefer JWOWW One &amp; Done.</li>
            <li> So Since I am a tanner this lotion was nice but I am picky with what I use for skin care especially since I do tan.. nobody wants that saggy skin. I would recommend the other lotions by Jwoww like natural bronzer and white wedding bronzer they smell amazing, protect tattoos, yogurt base and full of antioxidants!</li>
            <li> I like the way it smells, some people complain about the bronzer giving them an orange color but I don&#x27;t notice one on me and neither does anyone else. I&#x27;m pale but tan very easily and get a golden color and that&#x27;s exactly what I got with this lotion. I can&#x27;t review on the &amp;#34;speed&amp;#34; of it since I tan pretty fast with just about any lotion I use.</li>
            <li> Loved this! Definitely would buy this again. Not many tanning lotions can give you a difference in just a few days. I have more of an Olive skin tone so I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s different for everyone.</li>
            <li> Thank you product delivered on time</li>
            <li> My husband uses the Jwoww Black Bronzer Tanning Lotion. He loves the way it makes his skin look. I highly recommend this tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> This tanning lotion works great. What I really love is that it doesn&#x27;t  smell to strongly. I would defiantly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The lotion works great, I had not tanned in awhile and it has helped me get tan more quickly than I usually do. It is much cheaper than the salon price!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great lotion not an oil. All her products are awsome ! I would buy again and again. I would recomed.</li>
            <li> I have been using this lotion for a few years now. I absolutely love the way it smells, my skin is crazy soft and I get tan faster. I had been buying it in the salon for $50.00, so glad I found it on here for $26!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this lotion and got a GREAT price on it! It totally gives you an even bronze color when you tan.</li>
            <li> I received it pretty fast. When I tanned when I first got it, it really made a difference. Now I would be super dark if I had not stopped tanning but I love this lotion, and I would reccomend it to people who already have a good base tan wanting to btw really dark. I don&#x27;t like tingle sothis is a good fit for me. Aand I guess the pro is that I don&#x27;t smell burnt or cooked when I get done, and its not too sticky:)&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely say thumb&#x27;s up!!</li>
            <li> Love this lotion, Use along with her tingle product. Great tan, couldn&#x27;t ask for a better one. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I like this product because it doesn&#x27;t make you feel &amp;#34;nasty when leaving the tanning bed. Also shows great results.</li>
            <li> I tan using the new euro beds (new to me). Only 12 minutes max.  This lotion gives a nice bronze color.  It also hydrates wonderfully.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Love the lotion and no horrible after tan smell.  Produces a very rich golden color within a few tanning sessions.</li>
            <li> I purchased this from a salon and LOVED it!  Then I decided that I&#x27;d save money and buy it from Amazon.  This product is absolutely not the same.  Everything from the color to the smell is not correct.  Wait till it goes on sale at your tanning salon and purchase from there.  Otherwise you&#x27;re wasting your money.</li>
            <li> By far the best tanning lotion that I&#x27;ve ever used.  Within just 2 weeks, I have a better tan than I did with other tannings lotions in a month of tanning.  Would recommend this to any tanner!!!</li>
            <li> Love the product, got it in two days like stated....again love the product and will tell all my friends about your web-site.</li>
            <li> first and foremost the salon tries to sell me this exact bottle for $85 dollars. why pay that when i can pay under $30 and get it within the next 2 days? the shipping is so fast i love not having to wait days on my product. and this product does exactly what it is supposed to. within one to two days of using it people start to notice that i am getting tanner!!!</li>
            <li> I love the smell! Only thing wrong is that I&#x27;m breaking out in hives from it!:( so now I have to keep searching for another tanning bronzer : ( If it wasn&#x27;t from me breaking out and itching I would buy this all the time!</li>
            <li> This lotion seems to defintely get you darker faster. I don&#x27;t tan everyday &amp; can&#x27;t seem to get to the tanning bed most days but when I get the chance to go this seems to give me that darker brown look I want.</li>
            <li> I am a blonde hair blue eyed fair skinned 22 year old girl.. the lotion has self tanning bronzers in it that make you look tan almost immediately after tanning but it seems to stick. I love the smell. I have noticed however it has the &amp;#34;Shave you legs - tan disappears&amp;#34; effect but mostly because of the self tanners.. It gives you long-term color as well though so its not just self tanning.. I would buy it again.. I think its worth it.</li>
            <li> Definitely a way better buy than paying $50 at salon. It gets you dark but doesn&#x27;t smell too good after tanning. You stink like sweat and need to shower ASAP. That&#x27;s the only reason for the 4.. Otherwise it would be a 5 star for price and quality.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I really like the gold bottle but this one ig great as well!!! Gives you a nice even tan and you do not burn up with heat in the tanning bed. Smells great and  feels good on your skin.</li>
            <li> Love this. Smells wonderful, works great to deepen your tan. I will re order. So nourishing for your skin. Feels great.</li>
            <li> Smells awesome! Not oily either. Very good product.</li>
            <li> Extremely fast shipping. Product was as described.</li>
            <li> Left my skin really soft..  Loved the smell as well but didn&#x27;t get me very dark at all...  Especially my legs...  Wouldn&#x27;t buy again sadly</li>
            <li> I have a tanning bed in my home between my daughter and I we have tried several lotions and this is one of the better ones. Of course you need to stay consistent in tanning or it fads fairly quick. Much better price here as I have paid 4 times as much for this same bottle in salons.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy ! Wasn&#x27;t the real stuff . I didn&#x27;t get any darker Nd ended up throwing it out waste of money</li>
            <li> My favorite tanning lotion by far!</li>
            <li> got the item right on time - was different packaging but it appears to be the same product.</li>
            <li> This is one of those tanning lotions where you don&#x27;t have to worry about smelling like you just came out of the tanning bed esp if you have somewhere to go after you tan. This is one of the best smelling ones i have ever had, definitely worth every penny. Its for indoor and outdoor tanning, and you definitely notice a big difference with just one use ! I&#x27;m a 23 yr old Latina and I&#x27;m very light skinned with just one use i felt very tan and felt great!!!</li>
            <li> this lotion is not worth the money it will leave you with a orange color I was not impressed at all with it and I would not recommened  it to anyone</li>
            <li> This is by far the best lotion I have ever purchased! It smells amazing and actually gives my tan a boost! It takes me&lt;br /&gt;Forever to tan.. This product cuts that time in half if not more! You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion. I get a great color from using it and it smells nice too. My skin feels soft after using it and stays that way for hours.</li>
            <li> love the lotion. Has helped my tan in the tanning bed and when i went on my cruise... but what tanning lotion doesnt. Smells good though</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product once... But whoa, does it smell!! It&#x27;s a very berry scent, so unless you like smelling like berry bubble gum all day, don&#x27;t get this. The scent does block out that tanning smell (plus), but given that you smell like sickly sweet berries, I have to shower immediately after using it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it work? Well, I haven&#x27;t noticed a big enough difference over other lotions for me to get over the scent. I doubt I&#x27;ll buy it again. Bummer, because I was really hoping this stuff would be great!</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t the same as the real thing. I should have known there was a reason for only paying a third of the real price...because you only get a third of the real product (if even that). The biggest hint I ignored was receiving the bottle when it had already been open. The top was off when I opened the package. I forgot my lotion one day, being completely oblivious for 2 months that this lotion wasn&#x27;t doing anything, and had to buy a sample packet at the tanning bed. It didn&#x27;t even smell the same! The real product is much thicker and shows much better color much sooner. I really think they just poured Jergens lotion into this bottle... I wouldn&#x27;t waste your money. Save it and get the lotion at the beds because this product is a complete fraud.</li>
            <li> Way cheaper than at the tanning salons and it&#x27;s the same product!  Can&#x27;t go wrong with this purchase! Love it!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this lotion! The smell is great before and after tanning. It doesnt leave that nasty after tanning smell. Would highly recommend it and i will be buying more of her product!</li>
            <li> So far, so good.  I think the scent is perfect and the consistency is better than the Designer Skin that I&#x27;ve used previously.  I&#x27;ve also used LIV and I think I like this product better. We&#x27;ll see how the color develops with further use. (that is why I only rated 4stars for the time being)</li>
            <li> This is the first tanning lotion I&#x27;ve ever tried and I really love it. Great smell and doesn&#x27;t leave any streaks or weird coloring. Definitely reccomend it!</li>
            <li> I have no idea what is wrong with this lotion. It goes on nice and thick, it smells great, but I&#x27;m still pale as a ghost 2 months into tanning. Maybe not pale but far from tan. I would not reccommend this product to anyone. I&#x27;ve heard great things about Jwoww&#x27;s tingle but would never buy it.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical after reading mixed reviews here, but I went ahead and ordered the product anyway. An authentic product may have been shipped at one point, but this one is certainly not. The first thing that made me suspicious was the lack of seal on the bottle. Next, the consistency of the lotion was just not right, it was sort of chunky and definitely not your typical tanning lotion. I bought a sample pack of the same brand and type from my salon, and it felt and smelled different. This product is a fake.</li>
            <li> As an avid tanned, I have used many lotions. Newer than this as well. This lotion is more for those that do not yet have a base tan. If you have been tanning for awhile and want to get darker or get over the plateau this is NOT the lotion for you.</li>
            <li> Love this product, makes my skin nice and soft while giving me an awesome tan. Would recommend to every one.</li>
            <li> Great bronzer with a nice scent. Does not stain clothes. A lot cheaper on line than in the salon.  Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Much better than the Millenium lotion.  Smells great and gives a nice even tan.  Will definitely purchase again!  Love it!</li>
            <li> For those of you who like immediant progress but not tingle this is the lotion for you! Smells great and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been to the tanning bed in about 2years so i wanted to make sure I got a popular product because I knew if everyone else is using it, I&#x27;d probably like it too. And I did! It smells really good and works really well. Make sure though and you do not constantly use this, you need to switch lotions every 3 weeks. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like about this was when you use a couple of times it&#x27;s hard to get out of the bottle because of the shape of the bottle. Other than that it is great plus it&#x27;s wayyyyyyy cheaper on here than it is in the salons.</li>
            <li> i love the fruity scent of this lotion! plus, it leaves the skin smooth. however, i dont see it helping with the solarium tan?</li>
            <li> I was really hesitant about buying tanning lotion online but this works great! It looks just like my friend&#x27;s tanning lotion that she bought from the salon and paid 70 dollars for!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the type that can sit outside and within 5 mins have a tan if its a nice hot day. Thought this would of been a great fit for me. Turns out my tanning studio and I came to the conclusion since my lotion was a totally different shade of color that it had been watered down to ship out in bulk. I did not get tan what so ever. Sad but true. Ill never buy lotion off the Internet again.</li>
            <li> love this product..doesnt stain your hands..good smell..you can tell a difference in one lay..gets ya dark fast and doesnt fade!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an experienced tanner so this was useless to me. On my skin, it acts only as a moisturizer or maximizer, not a bronzer. I got no color from it at all, I might of well used regular lotion. The smell is pleasant though with no after tan smell! But like I said, probably would be best for someone just starting out tanning!</li>
            <li> Some of the best tanning lotion ever. It got my tan really fast and i would uae thia stuff over and over again!</li>
            <li> This lotion is so good! I usually never tan but this lotion really helped me get a base tan so I assume its good for beginners! I LOVE THE SMELL!! Its like a good berry smell, not too strong but very noticeable. Its about my 3rd time using it and I am noticeably darker. Another plus is NO AFTER TAN SMELL, you still smell like berry after leaving the tanning bed, so if you wanted to go out after a tan you could. It goes on very silky and smooth, rubs in easily and very moisturising and non sticky! Would definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> This smells great and it is much cheaper on Amazon than in the salons. I am very pale and I tend to not really commit to tanning as I should but this works as well as others and smells great!</li>
            <li> I thought this lotion and tried it for a week I already ordered a different brand. It smells good in the bottle but not on your skin afterwards. The bronzers do not work well and what is there is more orange than tan. The most awful thing with the thickness of the lotion. I am extremely upset I wasted my money. I had to rub and rub to Get the lotion worked in. I&#x27;m Wondering if this lotion wasn&#x27;t a knockoff?? I expected a much better product from Australian gold.</li>
            <li> Product was more than 50% cheaper than the tanning salon. Exactly same product. Good price. Delivered on time.</li>
            <li> I love the Australian Gold Black Bronzer Dark Tanning Lotion.  It goes on nice and is a great moisturizer.  It doesn&#x27;t have the distinctive \\&quot;sun-screen\\&quot; smell.  I can tan and go without feeling greasy or stinky.</li>
            <li> Love that I can buy this tanning lotion for my personal tanning bed. Love her product. Shipping is fast. Will always order from here. Very pleased</li>
            <li> I have never had to write a bad review on a product. Ever!&lt;br /&gt;However, as much as I hate to admit this. The online purchased product was not what I thought I would be.&lt;br /&gt;I tan frequently, and wanted to try something now with a bronzer. One of the workers at the local salon told me to try out a packet of JWOWW&#x27;s Black Bronzer, and I LOVED IT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed a HUGE change in one session.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I tried Amazon because a friend told me I could find them for alot less then what the locals were selling them for.&lt;br /&gt;And then I found this. I will admit, the shipping was fast! But the moment I tried to apply the lotion to my skin...&lt;br /&gt;something wasn&#x27;t right. I noticed it right away. Application was almost too watery... and it kinda lathered and foamed up leaving somewhat of a weird white film. As if it had been mixed or diluted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought I would still give it a try... but after tanning daily in hopes of results... Nothing.&lt;br /&gt;If anything, I started to look kinda splotchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I went back to the salon and bought the \\&quot;same\\&quot; bottle they had in store.&lt;br /&gt;THEY ARE TWO COMPLETELY DIFFERENT PRODUCTS.&lt;br /&gt;They ever look different!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of you all reading this review, please don&#x27;t make my mistake.&lt;br /&gt;Although it is a little more in the salon, you will only need half of that product to go a long way.&lt;br /&gt;where this one will take about the whole product to get about nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it&#x27;s too good to be true, it probably is. ;)</li>
            <li> i got this lotion at my salon because the owner told me she couldnt keep it on the shelfs, i just figured it was so popular because jwoww is on a popular tv show (wich i cant stand cuz i hate drama) and she is really dark and known for tanning,but i decided to give it a shot when the owner said it was really good. well i bought it and for 50$ yikes! and when i pay alot for lotion i really want great results. well wasnt all that great to be honest. i will admit the bronzer is a nice brown shade not orange but when the bronzer wares away there isnt much of a diffrence in my accual skin color and it was my first time tanning for the season and i usually tan fairly fast cuz im part indian. so this lotion was just ok to me and its not all its cracked up to be. way to exspensive for the quality of the lotion. i have paid alot less for much better lotions with alot better results, just sayin, but hey its gonna be a big hit eigther way cuz of who she is so tear it up jwoww.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. Works and smells great! Its more of a jell than a lotion, than I would prefer.</li>
            <li> i havent used it yet i got it last yr at the end of tanning to have for this yr so ill let you know as soon as i use it</li>
            <li> After hearing about how great this lotion is from my tanning consultant, I paid a pretty penny for it. Two weeks later, my tan had faded by at least three shades. The lotion is light and oily and leaves me smelling like beer. When my consultant asked me how I like my JWoww I told her I was very disappointed with the way it had faded my tan. She then went on to say \\&quot;Yeah, I get that a lot..but we do have our house blend.\\&quot; I stopped her before she could pull it off the shelf and then switched consultants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your looking for a great lotion with an awesome scent that won&#x27;t leave you smelling like you&#x27;ve just walked out of a bar, go get Solid Black. I&#x27;ve used this for years. It smells great and gives my skin a nice, natural dark tan that lasts.</li>
            <li> I like this lotion a lot.  Very inexpensive on Amazon.  The smell is nice and lasts for a long time.  Nothing repulsive.  Not sure if it made a difference on my color, but I do like it.</li>
            <li> Jwoww Black Bronzer is great for anyone who loves to tan.  This tanning lotion gives you a beautiful bronze color quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fair skinned girl living in the midwest. I need color that looks natural and this is it. I get to a healthy looking tan (my pale self&#x27;s version of tan) with in 3-4 tans, and I don&#x27;t go full time (yikes! I would be toast). The tan lasts well too, I maintain maybe 2-3 times a week, but can still keep a decent color if I have to drop to once a week on occassion.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is fine, not super cheesy like some, it works for me.</li>
            <li> Works like described, Loved the smell. Good lotion.</li>
            <li> I have always enjoyed jwoww products. I have sensitive skin, so most lotions tend to cause rashes but all of jwoww&#x27;s products do not do that and not to mention the rich dark tan I get from these lotions.</li>
            <li> This smells great, it seems to work well and moisturizes. Can&#x27;t beat the price either, compared to what my salon charges for it ($80!!!!)</li>
            <li> doesnt smell too bad and works great.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff....smells great!</li>
            <li> Ive used this product before and absolutely loved the results only with one use. I could notice the bronzer in it. So I bought the bottle an couldn&#x27;t wait to get it so I could start tanning again. I received it Friday and went tanning on Saturday morning was so excited to use. Boy was that a disappointment! Had no results you couldn&#x27;t even tell it had a bronzer in it,was like sunscreen was in it! so yes im disappointed.  I went back tanning today and tried a sample packet guess what? I had immediate results.  So whats really in this bottle? Im alittle confused</li>
            <li> It was such a good deal for an awesome product. It&#x27;s $70 at my local tanning salon and I purchased it for $20. It works great, and smells good too! Definitely buying this from now on.</li>
            <li> I liked this lotion ok.  It made my skin feel nice while tanning. I however didnt recieve the  dark tan i thought i would get from it with bronzers. I used it but really wanted one that gave me a darker tan. Ill try other lotion in this maker.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been tanning for a good long time now, in tanning beds and outside. I love using this, I have pretty fair tan skin naturally and this product is amazing for me. I do also use a tingle lotion so that adds a boost. But if your a new beginner in tanning don&#x27;t not use a tingle lotion it will burn the hell out of you. But I love this product along with the sparkle lotion by jwoww for after tanning.</li>
            <li> I use many different tanning lotions. This honestly wasn&#x27;t one of my favorites. I doubt this is what Jwoww really uses LoL because it is really not very bronzing. It worked ok ( better than some other cheaper brands) but I prob would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love how this lotion smells but I couldn&#x27;t tell a difference in my tan.  I usually use Obsidian for reference.</li>
            <li> Love Jwoww her lotion made me darker with one use. It smells beautiful and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on the skin. I will be buying jwoww one and done now. Love you Jwoww! !! Smooches xoxo</li>
            <li> I got the package earlier then the shipping told me I would. I was also a little worried that the lotion might be frozen or burst open because I live in michigan, but it came perfectly fine. I was also worried about how it would smell, but it smells just like summer! GREAT BUY!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping! Good lotion!</li>
            <li> I liked it! It worked really well and the smelt very nice. One of my top lotions I have used!</li>
            <li> I love it, only tanned for three days an use it today got supper dark&lt;br /&gt; Highly recommend got to me fast</li>
            <li> Ordered for my wife. It was not even half the price she saw it sold for and she loves it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried my fair share of tanning lotions out there and try to give anything new a shot.  I&#x27;ve been tanning for 7+ years now and love bronzers.  This time for budget purposes, I wanted to find a tanning lotion that was $20 or less and chose to try this one.  It seemed pretty popular.  As far as the scent, it&#x27;s relatively mild compared to most.  You don&#x27;t get that burnt skin mixed with tanning lotion smell with this one that you do from a lot of other tanning lotions.  As far as color, however, I&#x27;m not impressed what so ever.  I&#x27;ve tanned quite a few times using this lotion already.. and to be honest, not seeing nearly the amount of color I should be seeing.  If you&#x27;re looking for a tanning lotion that gives you good color, I&#x27;d probably look elsewhere.. Designer Skin makes some really good ones that are relatively inexpensive as well.  Don&#x27;t buy into the name of this product and waste your money.</li>
            <li> It smells great!! I&#x27;ve already seen results just from the couple times I&#x27;ve used it.</li>
            <li> It is ok for a temporary cover but rubs off the next day</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this one from jwoww smell doesn&#x27;t do it for me I smell burnt after so I have to shower after.. I own a tanning bed and from my experience try the jwoww one and done advanced black bronzer.. Smells delicious and it pushes you to the next level of tan.</li>
            <li> Love JWOWW&#x27;s products</li>
            <li> I was fairly excited when I found this product for so cheap on Amazon. I ordered it immediately and the day I got it in the mail I noticed the smell of it didn&#x27;t smell anything like the same  JWOW bottle of lotion my friend had in the past. I shrugged it off as nothing, &amp; continued tanning as i usually would, using the lotion I had purchased. After a few days of little results, I decided I&#x27;d ask my tan care professional about the tanning lotion I had. What she told me absolutely disgusts me. Basically, people who sell this stuff for cheap online aren&#x27;t actually selling you what you think they are. She went on to state that it is VERY possible I actually  got half a bottle of Jergen&#x27;s lotion and half a bottle of cheap tanning lotion. She grabbed a bottle of the same exact JWOW tanning lotion off of their shelf, &amp; squeezed out some of the lotion onto her finger, &amp; then some of my lotion onto another finger . There was a HUGE color difference, &amp; scent difference between the two lotions. The REAL bottle of lotion was dark &amp; smelled amazing, while my fake bottle I bought off Amazon was fairly light &amp; smelled slightly  like hand Sanitizer. DON&#x27;T waste your money on any tanning lotion online, unless you order off an actual tanning salon website. Paying the extra $15 at the salon is more than worth it!!</li>
            <li> I do not like this lotion at all...it does not work.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT! SUPER FAST DELIVERY!</li>
            <li> Not impressed. This stuff didn&#x27;t do anything for me.</li>
            <li> Thrilled with this lotion! Takes me forever to get a base tan, used this lotion one time after not tanning for two years and someone told me they could tell I was tanning. Excited to tan more</li>
            <li> I bought this first because I loved the bottle and second because I had done some research and realized this was a top notch choice for tanning bed use. I have not been disappointed one bit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely light complected, so bad my skin is literally transparent. I&#x27;ve been tanning every other day for the past month using Pink Cabana with no change in color. I came on Amazon to see if there might be a better option for me and this was it!! I used it once and saw instant color. I&#x27;ve used it for a week now and already people can see a difference. I can safely say I will be buying more of this in the future. It went on thick, not expired that I could tell, and smelled good too! Everything that you&#x27;d want in a lotion, this is it! Thanks Jenny!! 😃 Pale skin goodbye, Jamaica here I come!</li>
            <li> Love this tanning lotion. Smells delicious and works well. Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Good smell, lasting color</li>
            <li> Amazing the best of her line</li>
            <li> Works just like it says, gets good ratings from others.  I&#x27;m fair skinned and do not tan easily.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Like Jwoww products but prefer the 50x dark tanning lotion - works quicker and lasts longer. This is nevertheless a good product for the price. Shipping was great.</li>
            <li> Good item bad shipping</li>
            <li> I like it alot !!!! I am used to using tanning lotions with the &amp;#34;tingle&amp;#34; in it... But I could tell after using the JWOW once that I was gonna like it and I do!!!</li>
            <li> I love it! It works really well. Smells great too! Fast shipping. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants a nice lotion.</li>
            <li> I noticed I was darker with only using this one time.  It spreads evenly and easily and smells nice too.  It doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel either.  The only downside is the opening, it&#x27;s kind of hard to get the lotion out after I&#x27;ve already started getting ready but it&#x27;s not to the point where I don&#x27;t use it because of it.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see much of a difference. I do like how it&#x27;s a thin lotion and it smells nice, just not spectacular!</li>
            <li> After about a year without tanning, I wanted to tan again. This lotion got me tan fast!! Love it ! Other products that I have tried would take a whille to even get a base tan and the tan would fade. With this lotion I only have to go tanning few times a wk I love it ! Can&#x27;t wait to try the others</li>
            <li> So far so good. Some have said it would leave and orange streak. I apply in a circular motion and wash hands after, then it works great!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like it. Done nothing for me.</li>
            <li> I bought this product from a salon.&lt;br /&gt;-It smells good&lt;br /&gt;-Doesn&#x27;t turn you orange&lt;br /&gt;-Still smells good after you tan*&lt;br /&gt;However,&lt;br /&gt;-Its hard to get out of the bottle&lt;br /&gt;-I&#x27;m a pretty pale person, so either this isn&#x27;t the right product for my skin or I&#x27;m just impatient but it doesn&#x27;t seem to have any significant effect on increasing my tan any more than any other product that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this lotion twice - which is why I&#x27;m giving it four stars, not five; will update to 5 stars later if the results continue to be good -  but so far I am impressed with this lotion and the JWOWW tanning line.  While I&#x27;ve been tanning for several years now and have tried lotions from all the major brands, I&#x27;ve just started tanning for the season and this lotion had made me at least two full shades darker with each use, going only once a week.  It smells nice, is a good consistency (not too thick, not too runny), and the after-tan smell is not as bad as with other lotions I&#x27;ve used.  Overall, I&#x27;m very impressed.  The package arrived on time and the bottle itself was sealed in a plastic shrink-wrap.  This is a lot of lotion for the price and I will definitely be purchasing more JWOWW products in the future.</li>
            <li> The lotion smells nice (to me at least, I&#x27;ve had comments from others that say otherwise). After going tanning just twice with this, I noticed a significant difference from the lotion I had purchased from the salon. The only issue I have is the shape of the bottle and how it can be very hard to hold onto when your hands are covered in lotion, so use a towel to hold onto it.</li>
            <li> I got the item before I was expecting it so this was shipped off right away which was great! And I have been enjoying using the lotion and I see myself getting darker ... however ... the past couple times I have gone tanning I have started breaking out in what looks like hives...only on the right side of my neck. A friend used this lotion before me and her entire body eventually started to break out in hives she could not tan and she finally realized it was the lotion. I did not think about this until it started to happen to me, so I think I&#x27;m going to have to get a new lotion. And I do like it, however apparently it is not for me</li>
            <li> When I went to the tanning bed they said it was expired. Not impressed. It seemed like it would have worked if it wasn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;expired, I&#x27;m very upset with this product.</li>
            <li> I just received this lotion 3 days ago. And I&#x27;ve tanned all 3 days and I&#x27;m already alot darker than I was going 2 weeks with a different lotion. I&#x27;m very impressed! And not to mention it smells soooo good! I&#x27;d wear this scent as regular lotion if they made it. I highly recommend this lotion. I can&#x27;t wait to see a month of tanning with this lotion results.</li>
            <li> Great light scent.  Gets you dark really quick.  Use in UV Tan Bed not that good for outdoor tanning.  But helps get you that deep bronze color.  No oranging.</li>
            <li> This order was not scheduled to arrive until Monday but showed up today (Friday). Awesome! Also very happy that items were in original packaging. I will continue ordering from this source as needed.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t my favorite made me breakout</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t thinki got original packaging. Wasn&#x27;t like other bottles I bought. I think it was an off shipment or someone repackages lower cost lotion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really pleased with this purchase. I had previously used Conceited tanning lotion, mainly because it smells amazing, so I was worried that buying the jwoww online without trying it could end badly... Luckily for me it smells and seems to work great! The bronzer is awesome, it smells great, and seems to work well for my skin. I suppose if anyone knows about tanning lotion, it would be jwoww :)</li>
            <li> I have tried my fair share of tanning lotions, from expensive (Designer Skin) to super cheap (some brand from Sally&#x27;s beauty store.) I am looking for something to give me a nice pop of color and won&#x27;t be so stinky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is OKAY. It&#x27;s nothing super amazing that I would rave about to others and I would not repurchase. I guess I had higher hopes, as some of the reviewers absolutely loved it and I&#x27;ve been through quite a few lotions. The smell is tolerable and not too intense when first applying to the skin, but after, oh my, I stink! :( the after smell is not pleasant whatsoever and I can&#x27;t wait to get it off me. I know all of them have an after tan smell, but this one is pretty bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it broke me out (on my back and face). I do have more acne prone skin and maybe this is something I would consider as well if you are prone to these issues before purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!! Gives copper gold hint to skin</li>
            <li> I been using this for a couple of weeks now out of all my lotions I recently bought this one seems to work the best. Jwow products are lot more effective then the Snookie products If your trying to compare.</li>
            <li> this lotion is amazing! it smells awesome, isnt greasy afterwards, and i saw results after the first time using it and i have fair skin.i will definitely recommend this tanning lotion</li>
            <li> Okay so when i first ordered this product from amazon i was super excited because i heard such good things about this product. Well after continuous use at the salon i started to notice weird spots on my legs. They were not sun spots or anything that had to do with having skin problems. The side of my legs were super dark and then the inside of my thighs and shins were not as dark. after i showered and shaved they still look like i have dark spots or a skin issue. This is not a good quality lotion and if you use it BEWARE. After you use it for awhile you will notice your legs starting to look like mine. My legs are getting back to normal but its taken over 4 weeks of scrubbing and non use of this lotion for it to go back.</li>
            <li> I was truly excited to purchase this lotion however after waiting for 4 weeks for this product it came unsealed, and busted up in the box. i will NEVER purchase from this seller again</li>
            <li> First off the bottle is not sealed when you get it (like medicines are). It did have a pleasant smell compared to other products ive used. It did keep my skin feeling soft after tanning instead of dry. I must have gotten the fake stuff because it did not do ANYTHING. The label states it is used for indoor AND outdoor tanning. Three times I put it on and laid out in my yard (30 mins each side). I live in the south and the sun is incredibly strong here. Nothing. No color whatsoever. While it did not tan me it did keep me from getting a sunburn. I get very noticeable tan lines on my shoulders when I mow the grass outside so I should have gotten at least a glimpse of color but I didn&#x27;t. Then I started using the tanning beds at my gym. We have the turbo 12 minute standup beds. I went 4 times at 8 minutes,3 times at 10 minutes, and 1 time at 12 minutes so far. (plus another one time outside yesterday) I wear a bikini bottom but no top inside the beds (and in the yard). I still have NO TANLINE. I see no difference in my skin tone anywhere. I really wanted to get some color before we go to the beach in july (6 weeks from today) but I guess I will have to go do the Mystic Spray Tan. I had such high hopes for this product.</li>
            <li> My husband and I both love this bronzer, use it every time we go tanning. It doesn&#x27;t have that cloying artificial &amp;#34;beachy&amp;#34; smell that all the others have, and leaves you feeling with just a nice moisturized skin all over.  We would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> this didnt cause any irritation or weird coloring. i have very pale skin and this did not make me orange, i was a very natural tan color. good smell, worked quickly. i would certainly buy again</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really help me get any darker than usual. But had fast shippimg</li>
            <li> Works great! Gets you dark much faster than other tanning lotions I&#x27;ve used. This one is my favorite!</li>
            <li> I believe this is a knock off. I have used this product at the tanning salon and have had great results. When I received this product it was a different smell and consistency. This tanner has done nothing for me. I get more results from a 10 dollar tanner and Walmart. This product is nothing more than a bronzer. I have used almost the whole bottle and have developed no tan from it.</li>
            <li> My favorite lotion so far. Love the fact I can get out the tanning bed and look darker than if I had used anything else. Smells really good too. Shipped fast. Great price especially compared to the salon price.</li>
            <li> it doesnt say how strong the bronzer is on it and it wasn&#x27;t strong i could have gone with a cheaper lotion that did better I would say if you are just starting it is good but if you are looking to get tan fast then I would not recommend this.</li>
            <li> I got this wanting a darker tan and I am really not achieving that. I am pretty sure its because my tanning place sucks. I used to go to another place where I could get a darker tan than I have now. But because of conflicts with their business I got out. I am pretty sure if you have a place that you love to go to and use this product, it will give you a really dark tan. Try it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the mean time, I will be looking for another tanning place to go to.</li>
            <li> I read all reviews, and wasn&#x27;t sure if this lotion is in fact for me....my skin tone is medium to dark, I get tan easily even outside, never turn red.  this lotion made me darker after first use and it does smell yummy.  other lotions I used smelled nice when I put it on but after tanning I stunk!!! this one, even after I smell nice so I don&#x27;t have to hide at home until I take a shower.  once again, this may not work for pale people, or those who turn red easily, but for ppl with my tone of skin....def get it&lt;br /&gt;ps. this lotion costs 60+ in my tanning salon, so go figure....saving$$$$$</li>
            <li> I Love this product and you smell great after using it.  Some lotions smell good before tanning.  This product smells good before and just as good after.  I love the smell.  Not real strong.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had better luck with this than the solid black 100x bronzer. It smells pretty decent and you can tell a difference right after you go tan!!</li>
            <li> A friend introduced me to this lotion, and I fell in love with it.  It smells great, when I leave salon my skin still feels soft and moisturized, not sticky and dry.  At the shops this bottle goes for $50 +.  Amazon has the best deals!  Plus I got it in the mail 3 days after I submitted my order!  Thanks Allstar Tanning Products! Definitely buying all my tanning necessities from you for now on!</li>
            <li> smells good, doesn&#x27;t leave orange(y) brown streaks, and so much less expensive than the salon price.  would definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted, works great.</li>
            <li> havent used this that much. Smells great. Gave me some color when i used it for indoor tanning</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t pass up a deal this good. great price. smells good, and it really does work, great bronzing tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> I had a good tan, then I switched to Jwoww. I now have a world-class tan. The day after the first time I used it, I had three complete strangers remark about how fantastic my tan looked. The absolute highlight was taking my shirt off at a doctor&#x27;s office and hearing a nurse say \\&quot;Wow! You are DARK!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t streak, you&#x27;re never orange, and the smell is pleasantly neutral (a big plus for a guy, as so many lotions today have a floral \\&quot;feminine\\&quot; scent).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a serious product for serious tanners.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t even the real jwoww lotion ..it smells somewhat the same but its not as effective at all and it is thicker and leaves your skin feeling sticky and gross....do not waste your money! Might as well not even use any lotion at all....this does not work.</li>
            <li> The prodcut is fine, it smells good, and was a great price. Ive almost used it all and i dont feel like it helps get you as tan as you want. I will choose another lotion next time.</li>
            <li> Excellent tanning lotion! I have used this before and purchased it again after using other lotions that weren&#x27;t satisfactory. I like how this smells before and after tanning. Very light smell almost a powdery sent. I like to try new tanning lotions but most stink after tanning giving me a headache. This one doesn&#x27;t plus it tans my skin quickly.</li>
            <li> I used a sample of this years ago at the tanning bed but I never knew what it was. And this was definitely it. It has an amazing smell and it rubs on so smoothly.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion. Works amazing</li>
            <li> Love the Jwwow Taninng Lotion! Got great color really fast!I&#x27;m very pale naturally and was so surprised how quickly I noticed a difference. I had laid 4 times and people were already complimenting how dark I was! Love!</li>
            <li> Jwoww!! LOVE the smell. enjoyed using this product because it gave my skin a great glow. No faded spots, no funky lines.</li>
            <li> ive used this three times and feel im already getting darker. does not cause streaking, smells good and will prob buy more after this is gone</li>
            <li> I bought this same product at my tanning salon and it cost a lot more.  I was unsure about ordering on-line because some people said they got products that were expired and some that didn&#x27;t even work but I figured I would give it just one try. I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  I actually think I get better color with the one that I ordered on line than the one I bought in the salon.  It arrived quickly and is priced right.  I will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> Lotion isn&#x27;t too dark and doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling greasy.  Smell is ok.  A great price.  Helped me with a bronzy tan.</li>
            <li> Gives a nice deep tan when used in my tanning bed. Love that there is no after smell. Helps to moisturize the body.</li>
            <li> Bought this at mt tanning salon for $50. Ill buy here next time. This stuff is awesome!!!! Didnt notice a &amp;#34;berry&amp;#34; smell tho. No orange hands, skin stays hydrated, bleands well</li>
