    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This is an attractive cosmetic bag fashioned from quilted looking nylon.  </li>
            <li>In terms value (price vs quality), I find the bag to be not that great.  </li>
            <li>B00F9Q6G5I BelleSha Water Resistant Cosmetic Bag]] is a great bag for storing toiletries at home or on the go.  </li>
            <li>Very nice.  </li>
            <li>-in-all, this is a nicely designed bag that&#x27;s ideal for carrying</li>
            <li>It is  very suitable for traveling as it is water resistant.  </li>
            <li>The size and shape seem good for a cosmetics bag.  </li>
            <li>the bathroom, having a case to protect against water damage is usually a good idea when it comes to cosmetics.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is plenty roomy for all of her &amp;#34;stuff,&amp;#34; and she is happy to have a place to safely keep it all</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a nice looking bag and a good size for me to hold toiletries when I travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided with a sample for the purposes of a fair and honest review.</li>
            <li>I was impressed when I saw this pretty Cosmetic Bag.  </li>
            <li>The stitching is nicely done and all the seams are taped.  </li>
            <li>It would have been nice if I could clip out the mirror and have the lease longer so it could keep the bag on the table while looking at my face in the mirror.  </li>
            <li>I received this product for an honest review.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, a nicely made bag that does the job that it&#x27;s supposed to</li>
            <li>The loop feature would make it nice for travel because it can be attached to an inside luggage strap to keep it from shifting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>BelleSha asked if I would give an honest review of their product.</li>
            <li>I think it is a nice size</li>
            <li>It would be great for travel or even keeping special cosmetics in one place where you know where they are.  </li>
            <li>It is a well-made, attractive, and a handy size, and I very much recommend it.</li>
            <li>Around $6.00 would seem like a more competitive price and anything below that would be a bargain.  </li>
            <li>too sure I’d use them for anything.</li>
            <li>This falls in line with my experience with most BelleSha products.</li>
            <li>(ok, I spashed it with water)</li>
            <li>It is able to stand upright, because of it&#x27;s wider bottom, and has a zippered pocket inside, as well as a couple additional pockets.</li>
            <li>but I guess in a pinch it would be better than nothing.</li>
            <li>There is a loop on one side of the top that you can hang the bag on a hook.</li>
            <li>the price, I’d say that this is a pretty good bargain.</li>

            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a complimentary sample to check out for a review and am happy to be sharing it with my favorite kid in the whole world. :)</li>
            <li>The bag&#x27;s construction is just ok, as is the stitching on the lightly quilted exterior.</li>
            <li>Maybe not the best construction compared to what you can find at your local mall department stores, but not bad value.  </li>
            <li>I was asked to provide a review after trying out this handy, useful, needed product.</li>
            <li>not in use, the BelleSha cosmetic case can be easily flattened out and stored in a drawer.  </li>
            <li>This quilted canvas, water-resistant cosmetic case is a beautiful shimmering royal blue.  </li>
            <li>bright blue cosmetic bag (or toiletries bag, if you do not use cosmetics) is a suitable bag to store your liquid toiletries in when you travel.</li>
            <li>The size is adequate for you to place quite a bit of your Cosmetic products safely.</li>
            <li>The zipper operates smoothly and the material is water</li>
            <li>I received this bag free from the manufacturer in exchange for a review.</li>
            <li>I use it for eye liners that can come free from caps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It can stand on itself when filled with your things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The end of the top zipper extends beyond the bag allowing it to be useful as a loop for hanging the bag on a</li>
            <li>I filled it with water</li>
            <li>I was contacted by a rep for BelleSha and provided a free sample for the purposes of giving my thoughts on it.*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li>mo25ID6OP1393OY]]My wife says she likes the bag and will enjoy carrying her cosmetics in it when we travel on out-of-town trips.</li>
            <li>On close examination when the item was first removed from its shipping container, more than one imperfection in the construction were observed.  </li>
            <li>do love the shimmer-like royal blue and if someone wanted to, it’s the perfect type of bag to monogram or do counted cross stitch on.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The quilted quality may enhance water resistance as the surface can be wiped clean.</li>
            <li>While most of that used to wind up sitting around on the vanity in the bathroom thanks to this BelleSha Cosmetic Bag</li>
            <li>If it doesn’t, I’ll update this review…but right now, the bag gets a clear four stars for a nice balance of cost and function.</li>
            <li>If it doesn’t, I’ll update this review…but right now, the bag gets a clear four stars for a nice balance of cost and function.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a guy, so I&#x27;m easy because the items I need to get ready in the morning can be tallied up on one hand.  </li>
            <li>They look nice but zipper broke the third time I unzipped it!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, a nice big bag that works well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the price, it is a nice, simple cosmetic or toiletries bag.</li>
            <li>I had a much more luxurious cosmetic bag from a major U.S. manufacturer that did bleed color into my luggage all over my packed clothes when something leaked inside</li>
            <li>Available in blue or pink, this is great for men and women alike.  </li>
            <li>It is an attractive blue color, with a diamond stitch pattern on the outside.</li>
            <li>pretty roomy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the blue color, too!Live and learn!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>I love the blue color, too!</li>
            <li>The quilting gives a bit more protection than the bag she&#x27;s currently using, and both the interior lining and the quilted exterior are water-resistant in case of leaks.</li>
            <li>It safely keeps her hair bands and clips in the individual pockets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only problem I could find with the bag was that the piping on the top of the bag had some disruption in the stitching.  </li>
            <li>I am glad we have this product and would definitely recommend it for others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is a simple 6.5 by 9.75 inch pouch with a zipper on top.</li>
            <li>Pretty but defective. ..</li>
            <li>This is a very decent quality bag cosmetic organizer.  </li>
            <li>Here’s a large makeup bag to hold all your makeup essentials, including a full-sized brush.  </li>
            <li>A nice little feature that could come in handy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This shimmering BelleSha cosmetic case is medium and accordions out, standing flat on a surface for easy access to the contents.  </li>
            <li>It is cheaply made inside and out (large stitching, narrow seams, etc.)  from cheap materials.  </li>
            <li>so it is comforting that this inexpensive bag is, indeed, color fast.</li>
            <li>bag itself appears to be well made and from the very non-scientific tests I did</li>
            <li>, I really did like this bag.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The bag has a 2 inch gusset on the bottom allowing it to be very durable and sturdy upright.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a convenient size neither too small nor too large and can fit into a suitcase or duffel bag easily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pleasant color and the blue makes it easier to find in a dark interior of luggage.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and if you need more than one to hold all your items, use one for the liquids, and the other for any non-liquid supplies you have.</li>
            <li>As other reviewers have noted, it&#x27;s a bit bigger, more in my experience tall than broad, so it stands up more on the tabletop rather than lies squat.</li>
            <li>The zippers are of decent quality.  </li>
            <li>Similar bags of equal or greater quality can be found a lower cost.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve had many things make a mess from shampoo to shaving cream, and while this is for my wife that aspect is something I appreciate.  </li>
            <li>Speaking of the mirror, while its inclusion is nice, the aforementioned tether is very short, allowing the mirror to barely come out of the bag.  </li>
            <li>The bag appears to be made of high quality material and we have not had any issues with it since we have had it.  </li>
            <li>This bag looks a little nicer than the product photo and feel ok for something water</li>
            <li>BUT, she fell in love with the little mirror inside.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The material is silky but thick and durable, giving a nice quilted effect.  </li>
            <li>Live and learn!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>The enclosed mirror is extremely small and looks very cheap; nonetheless, it’s fully functional.</li>
            <li>You can see from the picture that the width at the top is very narrow:  </li>
            <li>This might be handy for small items that might get lost in the bigger compartment.</li>
            <li>More or less, the item was starting to come apart without ever being used.  </li>
            <li>The bag is soft sided, and water resistant so water splashes just bead up.  </li>
            <li>The bag is big enough to hold a decent amount of items of various sizes and also small enough to where I&#x27;m sure it will be easy enough to take when on vacation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good for a quick glance at yourself, but next to impossible to use for application of the makeup.  </li>
            <li>Functionally, this bag will perform the role of holding your cosmetics and protecting the rest of your luggage from any inadvertent leakage that might occur, but it is obviously not of the same quality that you’d see in most average cosmetic bags found in U.S. shopping malls.</li>
            <li>The color, a  deep dark blue, and the checkered pattern made it quite appealing to the eyes.  </li>
            <li>(Small cheap mirror,</li>
            <li>It may mean a longer brush or curling iron, say, cannot be as easily carried, but for a man or a woman, the products one needs can tuck in here.</li>
            <li>Both the outside zipper and the smaller interior one appear to be of decent durable quality.  </li>
            <li>I just had to pull it and it was fixed again; however, I now have no confidence that the zipper will last long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>One one side, there is a zippered pouch just the right size for a few pieces of jewellery.</li>
            <li>In particular, the stitching is not heavy duty and it needs to be for a product like this that will be used repeatedly multiple times every day and will toss around in your suitcase or day bag together with other items that might snag it.</li>
            <li>This cosmetic bag from BelleSha is much nicer than expected and the blue color is beautiful.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Mine came with its zipper broken, but I was able to get it back on track.  </li>
            <li>On the plus side, the fabric is nice looking and silky, but on the other hand, the zipper arrived broken.</li>
            <li>I purposefully wiped (i.e., forced) the water into the fabric and put the wet bag on a white paper towel in the sun to see if any of the blue die in the fabric would bleed through; I was pleased to see that it did not.</li>
            <li>Considering that the zipper sits down in the bag a little, and the bottom folds out to 2 3/4&amp;#34;, the usable depth of the (filled) bag is only 6 1/2&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>On the other side are two larger transparent vinyl pockets plus a little mirror attached by a ribbon that can be used for a quick touch-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> They look nice but zipper broke the third time I unzipped it!  Poor quality</li>
            <li> This cosmetic bag from BelleSha is much nicer than expected and the blue color is beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The material is silky but thick and durable, giving a nice quilted effect.  The stitching is nicely done and all the seams are taped.  The zipper has a metal pull tag and it is wider than the bag and there is a carry loop on one end.  There is a flat bottom about 2 1/2 in. wide so the bag will stand upright.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The inside of the bag is lined with a water resistant nylon.  One one side, there is a zippered pouch just the right size for a few pieces of jewellery. On the other side are two larger transparent vinyl pockets plus a little mirror attached by a ribbon that can be used for a quick touch-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BelleSha provided a sample for review.  It is a well-made, attractive, and a handy size, and I very much recommend it.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo3U41TGZTYN6GT]]This cosmetics bag is pretty roomy.&lt;br /&gt;Outside dimensions are 10.25\\&quot;L x 6.5\\&quot;H.&lt;br /&gt;Inside dimensions are 9.75\\&quot;L 6.4\\&quot;H  and can expand to 2.75\\&quot; in width.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has one large compartment, 2 small pockets.It has a small 1.5\\&quot; x 1.5\\&quot; mirror on 4 inch lease. I thought the emergency mirror was a neat idea, but it is not removable and the lease is very short. It would have been nice if I could clip out the mirror and have the lease longer so it could keep the bag on the table while looking at my face in the mirror.  The zipper operates smoothly and the material is water resistant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a nice looking bag and a good size for me to hold toiletries when I travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This bag is provided by BellaSha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ali Julia review</li>
            <li> This is an attractive cosmetic bag fashioned from quilted looking nylon.  It is  very suitable for traveling as it is water resistant.  The inside of the bag includes another small zippered compartment, two plastic pouches and a small mirror.  Both the outside zipper and the smaller interior one appear to be of decent durable quality.  I am taking two stars off the product since at the current Amazon list price of around $10 it seems to be overpriced.  Around $6.00 would seem like a more competitive price and anything below that would be a bargain.  I received this bag free from the manufacturer in exchange for a review.</li>
            <li> Here’s a large makeup bag to hold all your makeup essentials, including a full-sized brush.  The outside is a quilted blue nylon.  Inside you’ll find a soft nylon lining, a tag with a small mirror attached, two clear plastic pockets, and a nylon zippered pocket for small items that need to be kept separate from other items.  I use it for eye liners that can come free from caps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a nice big bag that works well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Four Stars!</li>
            <li> This is a very decent quality bag cosmetic organizer.  Very simple style.  it has padding on all sides in diamond pattern fabric.  There are multiple pockets inside the bag with one with a zipper closer.  There is also a small mirror integrated with the bag itself.  The zippers are of decent quality.  It can stand on itself when filled with your things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A sample of this product was sent to me for review purposes.</li>
            <li> This bag looks a little nicer than the product photo and feel ok for something water resistant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had many things make a mess from shampoo to shaving cream, and while this is for my wife that aspect is something I appreciate.  The size and shape seem good for a cosmetics bag.  Sample provided.</li>
            <li> Functionally, this bag will perform the role of holding your cosmetics and protecting the rest of your luggage from any inadvertent leakage that might occur, but it is obviously not of the same quality that you’d see in most average cosmetic bags found in U.S. shopping malls. In particular, the stitching is not heavy duty and it needs to be for a product like this that will be used repeatedly multiple times every day and will toss around in your suitcase or day bag together with other items that might snag it. On the plus side, the fabric is nice looking and silky, but on the other hand, the zipper arrived broken. I just had to pull it and it was fixed again; however, I now have no confidence that the zipper will last long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two, one-sided, clear-plastic pouches inside the bag. I’m not too sure I’d use them for anything. There is also a small zippered compartment. This might be handy for small items that might get lost in the bigger compartment. The enclosed mirror is extremely small and looks very cheap; nonetheless, it’s fully functional. The mirror is enclosed in a fabric frame and hangs in the bag by a fabric leash. The end of the top zipper extends beyond the bag allowing it to be useful as a loop for hanging the bag on a hook.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bag is definitely watertight. I filled it with water and it did not leak. I tried to get the outside wet and water just beaded on the surface and fell off…same with the inside lining material. I purposefully wiped (i.e., forced) the water into the fabric and put the wet bag on a white paper towel in the sun to see if any of the blue die in the fabric would bleed through; I was pleased to see that it did not. I had a much more luxurious cosmetic bag from a major U.S. manufacturer that did bleed color into my luggage all over my packed clothes when something leaked inside so it is comforting that this inexpensive bag is, indeed, color fast. I never thought to test the other bag before using it. Live and learn!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, I’d say that this is a pretty good bargain. I definitely plan to use it. I hope it will withstand the use I’ll put on it during my next trip abroad. If it doesn’t, I’ll update this review…but right now, the bag gets a clear four stars for a nice balance of cost and function. I love the blue color, too!Live and learn!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, I’d say that this is a pretty good bargain. I definitely plan to use it.

            <li> *Disclosure: I was contacted by a rep for BelleSha and provided a free sample for the purposes of giving my thoughts on it.*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the bathroom, having a case to protect against water damage is usually a good idea when it comes to cosmetics.  This zipper topped bag from BelleSha includes several pockets inside for helping keep things organized.  The bag&#x27;s construction is just ok, as is the stitching on the lightly quilted exterior. On close examination when the item was first removed from its shipping container, more than one imperfection in the construction were observed.  Some of the stitching had broken as well, particularly at hard corners.  More or less, the item was starting to come apart without ever being used.  The outside material appears to be good quality, while some of the inside material is not, mainly the pocket lining and the ultra thin strap that tethers a small mirror to the bag.  Speaking of the mirror, while its inclusion is nice, the aforementioned tether is very short, allowing the mirror to barely come out of the bag.  Good for a quick glance at yourself, but next to impossible to use for application of the makeup.  In terms value (price vs quality), I find the bag to be not that great.  Similar bags of equal or greater quality can be found a lower cost.  This falls in line with my experience with most BelleSha products.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo25ID6OP1393OY]]My wife says she likes the bag and will enjoy carrying her cosmetics in it when we travel on out-of-town trips. The quilting gives a bit more protection than the bag she&#x27;s currently using, and both the interior lining and the quilted exterior are water-resistant in case of leaks. Inside the bag are a zippered pocket and two open transparent plastic pockets for stowing away small objects. Inside the bag, there&#x27;s also a 1½\\&quot;x1½\\&quot; mirror, but the mirror is tethered, and it would be easier to use if it was removable or if the tether was longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all, this is a nicely designed bag that&#x27;s ideal for carrying cosmetics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A product sample was provided for review purposes.</li>
            <li> I was impressed when I saw this pretty Cosmetic Bag.  The color, a  deep dark blue, and the checkered pattern made it quite appealing to the eyes.  It opens with a zipper, has a small mirror inside, a small zipper compartment,  and two pockets. The size is adequate for you to place quite a bit of your Cosmetic products safely. It would be great for travel or even keeping special cosmetics in one place where you know where they are.  Very nice.  I received this product for an honest review.</li>
            <li> I need to state that I am NOT using this to store cosmetics in, rather I am using them for personal care items for my granddaughter when she comes to visit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We keep a little of everything in this bag - her sunscreen for when she swims, a hairbrush to get out the tangles, her toothbrush, her toothpaste, a scrunchie for the bath, and yes, even at age eight, her deodorant. It safely keeps her hair bands and clips in the individual pockets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this were for me, I would probably give it four stars. BUT, she fell in love with the little mirror inside. That pushed it up to a five star item, along with the fact that it is water resistant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is plenty roomy for all of her &amp;#34;stuff,&amp;#34; and she is happy to have a place to safely keep it all together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a complimentary sample to check out for a review and am happy to be sharing it with my favorite kid in the whole world. :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy, so I&#x27;m easy because the items I need to get ready in the morning can be tallied up on one hand.  My wife, on the other hand, has a lot of stuff that I have been assured is quite essential to her daily routine.  While most of that used to wind up sitting around on the vanity in the bathroom thanks to this BelleSha Cosmetic Bag I can once again see the vanity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bag itself appears to be well made and from the very non-scientific tests I did (ok, I spashed it with water) it appears that it is indeed water resistant.  The bag is big enough to hold a decent amount of items of various sizes and also small enough to where I&#x27;m sure it will be easy enough to take when on vacation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a nicely made bag that does the job that it&#x27;s supposed to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided with a sample for the purposes of a fair and honest review.</li>
            <li> This quilted canvas, water-resistant cosmetic case is a beautiful shimmering royal blue.  Inside the case there are two plastic pockets and one small zippered one.  There’s a small mirror tucked inside attached with a ribbon so it won’t become misplaced.  A nice little feature that could come in handy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The size is ample enough to put several cosmetics of choice in.  This shimmering BelleSha cosmetic case is medium and accordions out, standing flat on a surface for easy access to the contents.  One end of the zippered enclosure can be folded over into a loop and snapped to the side of the bag itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FEATURES:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;►  Keep your beauty kits neatly organized in one pouch&lt;br /&gt;►  Dimensions: 6.5 x 9.75 inches&lt;br /&gt;►  Water-resistant&lt;br /&gt;►  Quality zipper with inside mirror and pockets&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When not in use, the BelleSha cosmetic case can be easily flattened out and stored in a drawer.  The case is not lined so care will have to be taken if putting liquids such as small shampoo samples or other liquids inside.  The loop feature would make it nice for travel because it can be attached to an inside luggage strap to keep it from shifting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do love the shimmer-like royal blue and if someone wanted to, it’s the perfect type of bag to monogram or do counted cross stitch on.  The only problem I could find with the bag was that the piping on the top of the bag had some disruption in the stitching.  Of course that might spell return for some people.  Other than that, I really did like this bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for review.</li>
            <li> I got this bag for my daughter and she loves it.  She keeps all of her make-up in it.  This cosmetic bag keeps your beauty items well organized.  The bag appears to be made of high quality material and we have not had any issues with it since we have had it.  I am glad we have this product and would definitely recommend it for others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for reading my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was supplied a sample for test and evaluation.</li>
            <li> BelleSha asked if I would give an honest review of their product. Below are the thoughts from my wife regarding the Cosmetic Bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This bright blue cosmetic bag (or toiletries bag, if you do not use cosmetics) is a suitable bag to store your liquid toiletries in when you travel. Because it is waterproof, if anything breaks, it will not ruin everything else in your suitcase. It is able to stand upright, because of it&#x27;s wider bottom, and has a zippered pocket inside, as well as a couple additional pockets. I think it is a nice size and if you need more than one to hold all your items, use one for the liquids, and the other for any non-liquid supplies you have.</li>
            <li> The [[ASIN:B00F9Q6G5I BelleSha Water Resistant Cosmetic Bag]] is a great bag for storing toiletries at home or on the go.  Available in blue or pink, this is great for men and women alike.  The bag is soft sided, and water resistant so water splashes just bead up.  The bag features a tethered mirror inside, a zippered pouch on one side for storing lose items and two vinyl pockets on the other. The zipper is durable and has a carry handle on the end.  The bag has a 2 inch gusset on the bottom allowing it to be very durable and sturdy upright.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Review Sample Provided For Review And Evaluation]</li>
            <li> Maybe not the best construction compared to what you can find at your local mall department stores, but not bad value.  Mine came with its zipper broken, but I was able to get it back on track.  The zipper is not sewn in evenly either.  It is cheaply made inside and out (large stitching, narrow seams, etc.)  from cheap materials.  But, hey, it works well enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is definitely liquid-tight:  I tested by pouring in a cup of water and left it that way for a few hours.  It did not leak to the outside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dimensions mentioned on this product page are a bit deceiving:  Considering that the zipper sits down in the bag a little, and the bottom folds out to 2 3/4&amp;#34;, the usable depth of the (filled) bag is only 6 1/2&amp;#34; deep.  You can see from the picture that the width at the top is very narrow:  It is only one inch wide at the top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received a sample product from BelleSha.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have noted, it&#x27;s a bit bigger, more in my experience tall than broad, so it stands up more on the tabletop rather than lies squat. It may mean a longer brush or curling iron, say, cannot be as easily carried, but for a man or a woman, the products one needs can tuck in here. It&#x27;s a pleasant color and the blue makes it easier to find in a dark interior of luggage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quilted quality may enhance water resistance as the surface can be wiped clean. It&#x27;s a convenient size neither too small nor too large and can fit into a suitcase or duffel bag easily. I was asked to provide a review after trying out this handy, useful, needed product.</li>
            <li> My wife likes this simple blue cosmetic bag from BelleSha. It is a simple 6.5 by 9.75 inch pouch with a zipper on top. It is waterproof with a smaller zippered pouch on one side (inside) and two clear pockets on the other. There is also a small mirror attached to the inside by a strap. (Small cheap mirror, but I guess in a pinch it would be better than nothing. If you are traveling and in hotels, you wouldn&#x27;t use this.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We were provided the bag for review, and as I said, my wife likes it. It is an attractive blue color, with a diamond stitch pattern on the outside. There is a loop on one side of the top that you can hang the bag on a hook. It is waterproof, so if something opens inside, it shouldn&#x27;t leak out onto other things if this bag is inside larger luggage. However, there is a gap where it zips closed, so it it could leak from this opening, and small items could slip out of this opening if the bag were upside down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, it is a nice, simple cosmetic or toiletries bag.</li>
            <li> The zipper broke and the pull came off. Pretty but defective. ..</li>
