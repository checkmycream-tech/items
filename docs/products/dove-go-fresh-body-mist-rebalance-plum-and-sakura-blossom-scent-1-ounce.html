            <li>I love this Dove product and can&#x27;t believe it is not being sold in stores anymore.</li>

            <li>Sweet, refreshing scent!</li>

            <li>It smells so clean.</li>
            <li>My absolute favorite scent.</li>
            <li>I bought this product for my girlfriend as she has mentioned many times how much she loves the sent, and how it&#x27;s a shame that it doesn&#x27;t seem to be in stores anymore.</li>
            <li>Got here on time and exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Also the scent was only okay...</li>
            <li>I bought the smaller sized bottles here because I want to be able to slip one of these into my purse.</li>
            <li>I wish this body mist was made in a larger size because I love the soft, fresh scent.  </li>
            <li>Not overwhelming  Very refreshing.</li>
            <li>Shipped fast too.</li>
            <li>HOWEVER, if you&#x27;re not a traveler, I really don&#x27;t see a point getting these...</li>
            <li>This body mist lasts and covers up cigarette smoke better than any other product I have tried.  </li>
            <li>I simply thought to myself, what better place to go than Amazon for such a product!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light, not strong.</li>
            <li>I have used this particular scent in the past and I love it.</li>
            <li>She loves the compact size of these mini 1 ounce bottles as they are easy and convenient for everyday use and storage in her bag.</li>
            <li>I would have liked a bigger size but it is hard to find this stuff anymore.</li>
            <li>Only problem, which isn&#x27;t really a problem, is you can&#x27;t find it in the stores anymore.</li>
            <li>The smell is fantastic, it&#x27;s a very fresh sent that is not overwhelming like various other products out there.</li>
            <li>I think it is a little pricey here compared to how much it used to cost in stores for the 3 oz bottle.</li>

            <li> My absolute favorite scent. Wish they didn&#x27;t stop selling them in stores, and wish it didn&#x27;t cost so much for just a few bottles. Alas, my addiction to the smell keeps me purchasing.</li>

            <li> This is my favorite body spray. It smells so clean. If you haven&#x27;t tried it, you should. Only problem, which isn&#x27;t really a problem, is you can&#x27;t find it in the stores anymore. I can only order it on line.</li>
