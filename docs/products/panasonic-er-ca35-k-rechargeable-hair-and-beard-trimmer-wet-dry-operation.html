            <li>Awesome!</li>
            <li>ADD A DROP OR TWO OF OIL BEFORE EACH USE FOR BEST RESULTS,  </li>

            <li>but overall....its good!</li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s still cheaper than paying for haircuts, so that&#x27;s good!</li>
            <li>If you never use the shorter guards then that would work great.  </li>

            <li>GREAT CLIPPER.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just not as good as the one I had before, which was brilliant.</li>
            <li>Works Great...</li>
            <li>I was happy with my Wahl shaver but after moving overseas I needed to switch to a dual voltage shaver.  </li>
            <li>im sure it works awesomely without the cleaning i give it every time.      </li>
            <li>I searched all of amazon for the perfect hair trimmer, as I imagine most of you do.</li>
            <li>The clipper design and quality is excellent, but you have to be the one to make sure of good cuts.</li>
            <li>Easy to used , battery life excellent</li>
            <li>Charge is good and it performs well.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good quality product.  </li>
            <li>once you unpack it, which is not too good.  </li>
            <li>Definitely a good</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a good buy.</li>
            <li>My wife cuts my hair and she loved using these clippers.  </li>
            <li>Good Price for this item..</li>
            <li>This is quite a good hair clipper.</li>
            <li>good for the price</li>
            <li>Good luck finding it there.</li>
            <li>No cutter has been as good as this one.</li>
            <li>It does not have good result.</li>
            <li>Somehow I got it into my had that this would be a good multi-purpose</li>
            <li>Decided on the Panasonic after reading reviews and feel like I made a good decision.</li>
            <li>but this is my opinion, and i thought its good.</li>
            <li>Definitely, a good buy.</li>
            <li>Good for head, beard or body.</li>
            <li>It is good.</li>
            <li>Shame, because otherwise it&#x27;s a good hair</li>
            <li>....very good clippers</li>
            <li>Good ergonomic design that fits snugly in your hands for do it yourself trimming.  </li>
            <li>DO not buy thinking it good for longer beards, 1 1/2&amp;#34; longest attachment.</li>
            <li>Good product ..</li>
            <li>i use these clippers to cut my own hair its a great pair of clippers.</li>
            <li>Obviously a full dunking is not recommended, but I do not see any gaskets leading me to assume the water is best kept away from the battery portion.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect if you want to give yourself a quick buzz-cut.     </li>
            <li>i love it ,, i use it for trimming mostly and it does the job perfectly ,,</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s great because it works well and is very light.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very glad I found it.  </li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li>It has good heft in the hands and is very easy to maneuver.</li>
            <li>and I love that there is no cord!  </li>
            <li>I wanted to purchase this unit at $34 and $37 but (out of stock), so I paid $59, and gladly!  </li>
            <li>Nice size and shape.  </li>
            <li>Handy, convenient, water-proof,</li>
            <li>These are nice clippers</li>
            <li>I see my beard as a kind of topiary, and like to change its contours quite often.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Battery life is nice, have never had a problem with it running out on me.  </li>
            <li>About 18 months ago I bought this rechargeable trimmer to buzz cut my own hair.  </li>
            <li>my son and my own hair cuts.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Battery works nice.</li>
            <li>highly recomend the product the best trimmer</li>
            <li>I found they were very easy to change in and out</li>
            <li>It cleans very easy.</li>
            <li>Very easy to handle.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used these about five times so far and they are good quality and hold a good charge!</li>
            <li>problem is that when you use the shortest setting of the longest attachment, it perfectly catches the hair inside the attachment and COMPLETELY blocks the blades.  </li>
            <li>This is the best hair clipper so far.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best of all by far.</li>
            <li>On the plus side, compared to the Wahl the wet/dry operation means it&#x27;s nice to be able to rinse off when done.  </li>
            <li>I wish I&#x27;d gotten something more reliable.</li>
            <li>These cordless clippers are fantastic!</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>The combs have more teeth than competitor&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I stumbled onto this unit before purchasing another brand.</li>
            <li>This thing cuts better than my corded trimmer and more even also.  </li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t have to go to barbars any more.</li>
            <li>Panasonic has always had reputable products so took the plunge and purchased this shaver.  </li>
            <li>but I wish they had more attachments to leave your hair longer.</li>
            <li>but I would buy this unit again unless something better comes along.  </li>
            <li>Trimmer is ok...</li>
            <li>Feels almost like a demo model, but it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>Quiter than most others.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping of better quality by panasonic.</li>
            <li>I love the way this clipper handles.</li>
            <li>I was expecting more quality from Panasonic .....</li>
            <li>Overall though, very happy with this product.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have as many clipping lengths and the blades are flimsy.</li>
            <li>I wish it has more attachments.</li>
            <li>Basically it is perfect for a simple crewcut.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that is rechargable and don&#x27;t have to worry about the cord when trying to reach my husbands hair.</li>
            <li>Glad I chose this product.  </li>
            <li>It enables a 1.6\\&quot; cut, which is longer than most others I have researched.  </li>
            <li>If Panasonic installed double batteries, that would be awesome.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>For beard will be okay.</li>
            <li>and I have had 4 or more since a pair my barber gave me was stolen.  </li>
            <li>I will reserve judgement until more cuts.</li>
            <li>&#x3D;)</li>
            <li>It is a nice clipper as it cuts the hair pretty nice.....</li>
            <li>The process went just fine, very fine</li>
            <li>: I love that it&#x27;s wireless.. easy to use, clean, and charge!</li>
            <li>in the end, a fine product, but make sure you know what you want.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m sure you could probably buy a better model for more money, but for under $50, it&#x27;s well worth the price</li>
            <li>LOVE THE LIGHT WEIGHT AND CORDLESS FEATURES.  </li>
            <li>Easy to clean as well!</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s not so easy to tell which end is which.  </li>
            <li>Being able to wash it under the faucet makes for easy clean up.  </li>
            <li>Attachments for hair length are easy to attach or change.</li>
            <li>the guards are easy to change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It fits well in your hand and is easy to control.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fairly easy to master.)  </li>
            <li>I find the attachments easy to interchange.</li>
            <li>This clipper is easy to use and holds a charge well.</li>
            <li>The razor isn&#x27;t as strong as I thought, so you may have to go over some spots if you shave your head..</li>
            <li>Strongly recommended.</li>
            <li>quiet , no vibrations  cuts very good on battery power  easy to maintain clean  </li>
            <li>This product is, in general, a great trimmer.  </li>
            <li>This is exactly what my husband wanted so he can cut his own hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This was the first time I used a clipper for my own hair.  </li>
            <li>and it seems to work fine without pulling on the hair.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product and it just works fine.</li>
            <li>The product works just fine</li>
            <li>Fortunately, My son is fine with the simplest styles.</li>
            <li>Light and efficient.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I go the clipper, I called support to explain the charger light.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this trimmer for several months and it works great.  </li>
            <li>I use this product periodically for light hair trimming.</li>
            <li>In practice, it&#x27;s a cheaply built piece of crap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great product for the hair and if a short beard is desired.</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad it completely belied my expectation - it&#x27;s a really nice clipper.</li>
            <li>It is as good as the old one.</li>
            <li>Light but durable, charges quickly, cuts smoothly and easily, can cut while charging, easy to wash and clean.</li>
            <li>Having had a good experience with Panasonic trimmers in the past, I figured this would be a good replacement.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and came at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>i bought this hair clipper for my dormitory, we had used it for several times, it works good and also easy to control.</li>
            <li>Nevertheless, it is still best handy clipper till now, blades remain sharp, quiet motor, ensure efficient hair cut.</li>
            <li>Keep the blades clean and oiled, and it will run like a champ.</li>
            <li>Anyway, this guy works great for trimming up sideburns for those of us scarred by the &#x27;70s, around the ears in between barber visits, the neck/back, and even the more, ah, see no light areas of the body.  </li>
            <li>Very quiet which was awesome for my 9year old.  </li>
            <li>I took the blades off once to clean it and they rattled ever since.</li>
            <li>overall, VERY LIGHT WEIGHT, very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>It also holds a charge very well and can sit for a month or more and still work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this machine is cool</li>
            <li>So, I taught myself with trimmer, comb/scissors to cut my own hair as well as a professional.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light but powerful.  </li>
            <li>This trimmer is rechargeable and be used with or with out the cord, with a full charge it can give 4 or 5 haircuts, the blades are adjustable and when your done the head can be washed out in the sink...made by Panasonic, it can be used in the u.s. and countries with 210 volt power since it can be adjusted to use any rate of power.</li>
            <li>I grow a full beard, and I like to keep it between an inch or two in length.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s the slide on attachments that, I assume, are for giving people a full haircut.</li>
            <li>When received hair clipper, the feel good and motor so quiet.</li>
            <li>, however, the lower model from this line of trimmers had more blade settings which is a real plus.</li>
            <li>It works fine for the first 20 times or so...</li>
            <li>My seven number selector Wahls battery died and I needed something quickly.  </li>
            <li>but the battery wears out quickly and you will find yourself having to use it plugged in alot.</li>
            <li>The clipper/blade itself is very nice and doesn&#x27;t get caught and \\&quot;yank\\&quot; like other clippers have.  </li>
            <li>Cuts very well, desn&#x27;t pull the hair, easy to operate.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve done everything from urban cafe beards to long, bad-boy goats with stubble (not in that order, of course), all perfectly shaped even despite hairs growing in all directions.  </li>
            <li>just fine and is very sturdy</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>Overall, I don&#x27;t like it as it painfully catching hairs, which threaten me whenever I start to use it</li>
            <li>This product was well worth it.</li>
            <li>Great cordless trimmer, I use it for cutting my head every week and it works really good.</li>
            <li>I currently have a beard and this trimmer cut through it quick and easy!  </li>
            <li>Be sure to use the oil after cleaning and let it sit out to dry (alcohol works great in a pinch to dry it before oiling).  </li>
            <li>First of all, its not as quiet as a UFO, but much quieter than most, and way more than a Wahl.  </li>
            <li>It does the job just right.</li>
            <li>I really like the removable clipper head that you can clean out thoroughly.</li>
            <li>If you are going to use these clippers, it&#x27;s best to do it on dry hair (which I am used to clipping wet hair).  </li>
            <li>(more than 3&amp;#34;), this will give you professional looking, consistent cuts.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>This one is very near perfect, except for one detail: The plastic guards are divided into two groups, the ones for long hair and the ones for short hair.</li>
            <li>The unit works fine and all, but the biggest adapter does not cut my hair, and the next smaller one (12mm) is good for my sides, but cuts to short for the top - wish there was an intermediate length to fill that gap.</li>
            <li>I like this because it&#x27;s exactly the tool I needed to keep my beard carved up the right way, and without hassle.</li>
            <li>The clear length guide is easy to install and adjusts by increments which lock in place once the unit is turned on.</li>
            <li>What I expected it to be, and more!</li>
            <li>Good power; safe; easy to clean; just the right size of combs for normal hair and bird cutting, trimming.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s incredibly light, easy to maintain/clean, and strong enough to cut the thicker portions of my hair around the sides and back of my head.  </li>
            <li>When I first turned on the clipper</li>
            <li>It comes with a warranty and seems pretty durable.  </li>
            <li>thanks !</li>
            <li>Panasonic is not my first choice for anything, and I gave up years ago on Philips products.  </li>
            <li>the shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to go outside amazon to find the appropriate charger</li>
            <li>This one after a couple months use only works plugged in, it won&#x27;t hold charge for more than 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>No hair pulling, quieter than my older model, waterproof, and has a 45 min battery for quick nips.</li>
            <li>They still work just as well as they did the first cut.</li>
            <li>It has more than enough power and can be used with or without the cord.  </li>
            <li>but I really appreciate the effort and hardworking!</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked over many brands, and ultimately I picked this clipper.  </li>
            <li>Only thing I wish had was a case or bag to hold all the bits, and a better sealing oil container.  </li>
            <li>The first 6months it worked well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than some clippers that cost double out there.</li>
            <li>After several years, my old Conair clippers didn’t feel like they were giving me a good cut, even with a new blade, and the battery wouldn’t hold a charge worth diddly, so I went on the hunt for a replacement set.</li>
            <li>Nice sturdy build for home use compared to other brands that use cheaper plastic.  </li>
            <li>It doesnt sound powerful at all(very quiet).  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need lithium battery, one hour charge, non-oil self sharpen blade (I got skin irritation always), zoom wheel length setting, I only need a simple good hair clipper.</li>
            <li>Says it&#x27;s quiet and good for his very short cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After I called for customer support they told me the charger model is called WERCA35K7658 and that no other would fit.</li>
            <li>I do not know much about Hair/Beard  Trimmers, but he seems to like this one very much.</li>
            <li>The instructions were good, although I am not sure of the extent to which it can handle water exposure.  </li>
            <li>Panasonic was good in the past, but not this time.  </li>
            <li>This Panasonic is it, very few marketing points but a good hair</li>
            <li>It is quiet, easy to hold, and cuts well.  </li>
            <li>After several times, need take out the blade for clean and reassembly back, but more noise.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and we do the kids&#x27; hair regularly.</li>
            <li>I keep it plugged in at all times except to use it, and about 10-15 minutes is the most I am getting out of a single full-charge.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and very nice handle, but power only last not over 40 minutes, and it&#x27;s not really powerful, if you&#x27;re going to style your hair.</li>
            <li>Quiet, smooth, and painless.</li>
            <li>even when washing with water (cause water doesnt really wash oil)..</li>
            <li>Today I tried it and it worked very well.  </li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t mark it off a star.</li>
            <li>So, my brother really loves this clipper.</li>
            <li>He wants me to buy the blade replacements, so,  I am still looking for the blades or comb for this clipper.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>- I didn&#x27;t expect much from this.    </li>
            <li>Because of its shape and lighter weight, the Panasonic is much easier to hold.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d really recommend this one.</li>
            <li>These are very well built, quality, clippers.</li>
            <li>but it just takes wayyy too much hair off.  </li>
            <li>Also, the last few years, I have been impressed by Panasonic quality, not necessarily their prices.  </li>
            <li>However, this clipper is really inexpensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The included pieces help limit too much hair removal.  </li>
            <li>Worked very well, no complaints.  </li>
            <li>With these clippers I was ready in 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>CUTS VERY CLOSE WITHOUT A GUIDE,  </li>
            <li>I use my trimmer to shave my whole head once a week, so I wanted something that works in the States as well as in Europe or</li>
            <li>Very inefficient in close trimming.</li>
            <li>Turned out to be really reliable.</li>
            <li>It worked very well.</li>
            <li>I used to buy the hair clipper of Wahl and returned it immediately because of too much noise.</li>
            <li>This one is very good.&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li>One of the things I liked about the clippers is that there are 7 lengths total, with only 3 attachments (you use both sides).  </li>
            <li>battery power is good - lasts at least 3 shaves.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got tired of getting haircuts every six weeks that didn&#x27;t make me look as extraordinarily handsome as I was in my youth :).  </li>
            <li>It cleans easy and the battery has had no problem lasting through a normal hair cut (25 mins).  </li>
            <li>This is ok since I am only interested in a simple crewcut.</li>
            <li>But thats a matter of personal preference of being a clean freak.  </li>
            <li>I simply used the blower to clean up my body and deck.</li>
            <li>Granted I grow a thick, full beard, so maybe this isn&#x27;t an issue for most buyers.  </li>
            <li>It did hair cut smoothly and quietly, better even cut within short time, better than my other two Philips clippers (QG 3270 and QC 5340), not pull hair and little noise to be noticed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The clipper is easy to use, and I get about 4 cuts from a single charge.    </li>
            <li>Everyone likes the hair clipper and hopefully will enjoy it for a long time.</li>
            <li>Make sure you press the black button below the clipper in case it stops working.</li>
            <li>I had an older version of this model for 9 years.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really surprised on reading mainly positive reviews - based on them</li>
            <li>I was very surprised!  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend these clippers.</li>
            <li>I did not purchase the model he uses because the price is too high for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many beard trimmers over the past 30 years, at least a dozen: I&#x27;ve used the ones that are fantastic for a month or two and then start to lose their battery power, the ones that never have enough power to actually trim a beard and that choose to pull out the hairs instead, the ones that are perfectly powered but where the adjustable teeth keep slipping as you press them against your face, giving you stubble instead of a van dyke.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not a perfect stand-in, but it is a great travel clipper.</li>
            <li>When I first moved to Europe I completely destroyed my old shaver because it was not built to handle the dual voltage (240v here in Europe).  </li>
            <li>I cut my own hair at least monthly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The good:&lt;br /&gt;- 3 attachments will suit most men&#x27;s haircut needs - unless you like your hair really really really short or really long</li>
            <li>Apparently, the light comes on red when the charger is plugged in, but it just stays on.  </li>
            <li>I could go so far as to say the razor would work well enough to give a full cut to the head, although I am too wimpy to try it on myself.  </li>
            <li>Very quiet and powerful.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good, but not great.  </li>
            <li>Unlike other reviewers I&#x27;m fine with this--</li>
            <li>/&gt;Still, it&#x27;s better than most other products I&#x27;ve used, so it&#x27;s hard to be too upset.  </li>
            <li>Have tried a few different models with no luck, this one works great and lasts quite a long time on a charge.</li>
            <li>and I needed to buy a new one.</li>
            <li>and if this model is still around when ever I have need for a new one</li>
            <li>, this is the one I&#x27;ll buy, but seeing as I haven&#x27;t noticed any \\&quot;wear\\&quot; to date on this trimmer, I may not have a need for a new one for some time...</li>
            <li>I could live with that</li>
            <li>I have issues holding clippers at irregular positions, but my new panasonic clipper is easy to use in all odd positions for shaping.</li>
            <li>14 more words required  , but no more words needed.</li>
            <li>I bought the exact same model 9 months ago as a replacement.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If that is long enough for you, then this product will work just fine.</li>
            <li>It is easy to operate, but a few choices of hair style.</li>
            <li>So far this has been working like a champ</li>
            <li>you wash it,,, and water comes out directly through the bottom.    </li>
            <li>Bought these to replace my old clippers.  </li>
            <li>It offers the longest cut length I could find.</li>
            <li>It can also cut with direct connection to the voltage.</li>
            <li>Had an old Oster shaver that bit the dust.  </li>
            <li>I was looking to replace my old Panasonic rechargeable Hair Clipper that was with me 12 year.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in the military, have thinning hair on top, and been cutting my own hair for about 10 years.  </li>
            <li>Surprised at the quality of a cut this gave.  </li>
            <li>So far holds charge no problem, will see how it holds over time.</li>
            <li>It arrived with a charge, but I decided to let it completely charge overnight before testing it out.  </li>
            <li>It appears to charge, green light on,</li>
            <li>I bought a National (a Panasonic brand only really seen in Japan)</li>
            <li>I compare this to an old Norelco with a rotating dial (1-5 or whatever) that went from 1/16&amp;#34; - 1/2&amp;#34;, and this seems stupid.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>i like the cordless/corded options that it offers and it cuts through my hair with ease.</li>
            <li>The blades move significantly more slowly than my old device, and the device &amp;#34;feels&amp;#34; lower in quality from my old device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only cool thing is that you can rinse the whole thing down without worry.</li>
            <li>Makes for quick work on my beard and the charge last for a long time.</li>
            <li>The clippers are so sharp it made giving hair cuts fun.</li>
            <li>And setting is reliable, mile better than flashy design of Philips: funny zoom setting always change length when operating it, my wife and I had to cut my hair shorter and shorter again and again each time for 10 months, yanked my hair each time,</li>
            <li>and I have to say I am very disappointed and surprised at how many good reviews this product has gotten.  </li>
            <li>I was tired of the loud noise of the new clippers that we had just received not to long ago, and the fact the the teeth on the old clippers liked to bit the skin.</li>
            <li>As I dont for care for black, silver or orange, I just wish it were available in white.</li>
            <li>As for cleaning, as noted I am not sure it can handle complete exposure to water, so I just clean the removable cutter portion, blowing or brushing out the powered portion.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like how hard it is for me to remove the hair from the attachment and how easily it gets stuck in the blade.  </li>
            <li>That left me needing to purchase a new trimmer.</li>
            <li>Also, not particularly sharp.</li>
            <li>The problem is that there is a large gap in length from the short to the long.</li>
            <li>The longer length guard is clear plastic and attaches in a totally different manner than the shorter guards.  </li>
            <li>Not as loud as my last trimmer.</li>
            <li>ALSO VERY QUIET COMPARED TO MY OLD WAHL CLIPPERS.  </li>
            <li>purchased one online that seemed to be the right one it did not fit the ER-CA35.</li>
            <li>: A full charge will last through at least 2 complete haircuts.  </li>
            <li>I chose to pay a little more for this model about 2 and a half years ago and can&#x27;t say enough about this trimmer.  </li>
            <li>, I purchased this one hopefully to get the same feel as my old one.&lt;br /&gt;Indeed, it is, but only sharper; and the handle feels better.&lt;br</li>
            <li>You just have to start very high and work your way down to the length desired.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried at least 5 other models over the years; mostly the cheaper variety of $30 models.  </li>
            <li>My hair cut is to simple and not worth spending $11 plus a tip at a shop every three weeks, this thing paid for itself fast.</li>
            <li>It feels powerful enough, and is quiet, but the shortest attachment is 3/8\\&quot; unless you go down to the bare clippers, and those felt a bit rough to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Reasonable price &amp; does the hair cutting job well, especially with cordless design.&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning is easy.</li>
            <li>: easy to use, cordless, washable, no big noise&lt;br /&gt;Cons: less comb attachments, no favorite color</li>

            <li> GREAT CLIPPER.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just not as good as the one I had before, which was brilliant.</li>
            <li> Works Great...</li>
            <li> I was happy with my Wahl shaver but after moving overseas I needed to switch to a dual voltage shaver.  </li>
            <li> im sure it works awesomely without the cleaning i give it every time.      </li>
            <li> I searched all of amazon for the perfect hair trimmer, as I imagine most of you do.</li>
            <li> The clipper design and quality is excellent, but you have to be the one to make sure of good cuts.</li>
            <li> Easy to used , battery life excellent</li>
            <li> Charge is good and it performs well.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good quality product.  </li>
            <li> once you unpack it, which is not too good.  </li>
            <li> Definitely a good</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a good buy.</li>
            <li> My wife cuts my hair and she loved using these clippers.  </li>
            <li> Good Price for this item..</li>
            <li> This is quite a good hair clipper.</li>
            <li> good for the price</li>
            <li> Good luck finding it there.</li>
            <li> No cutter has been as good as this one.</li>
            <li> It does not have good result.</li>
            <li> Somehow I got it into my had that this would be a good multi-purpose</li>
            <li> Decided on the Panasonic after reading reviews and feel like I made a good decision.</li>
            <li> but this is my opinion, and i thought its good.</li>
            <li> Definitely, a good buy.</li>
            <li> Good for head, beard or body.</li>
            <li> It is good.</li>
            <li> Shame, because otherwise it&#x27;s a good hair</li>
            <li> ....very good clippers</li>
            <li> Good ergonomic design that fits snugly in your hands for do it yourself trimming.  </li>
            <li> DO not buy thinking it good for longer beards, 1 1/2&amp;#34; longest attachment.</li>
            <li> Good product ..</li>
            <li> i use these clippers to cut my own hair its a great pair of clippers.</li>
            <li> Obviously a full dunking is not recommended, but I do not see any gaskets leading me to assume the water is best kept away from the battery portion.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect if you want to give yourself a quick buzz-cut.     </li>
            <li> i love it ,, i use it for trimming mostly and it does the job perfectly ,,</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s great because it works well and is very light.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very glad I found it.  </li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> It has good heft in the hands and is very easy to maneuver.</li>
            <li> and I love that there is no cord!  </li>
            <li> I wanted to purchase this unit at $34 and $37 but (out of stock), so I paid $59, and gladly!  </li>
            <li> Nice size and shape.  </li>
            <li> Handy, convenient, water-proof,</li>
            <li> These are nice clippers</li>
            <li> I see my beard as a kind of topiary, and like to change its contours quite often.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Battery life is nice, have never had a problem with it running out on me.  </li>
            <li> About 18 months ago I bought this rechargeable trimmer to buzz cut my own hair.  </li>
            <li> my son and my own hair cuts.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Battery works nice.</li>
            <li> highly recomend the product the best trimmer</li>
            <li> I found they were very easy to change in and out</li>
            <li> It cleans very easy.</li>
            <li> Very easy to handle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these about five times so far and they are good quality and hold a good charge!</li>
            <li> problem is that when you use the shortest setting of the longest attachment, it perfectly catches the hair inside the attachment and COMPLETELY blocks the blades.  </li>
            <li> This is the best hair clipper so far.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best of all by far.</li>
            <li> On the plus side, compared to the Wahl the wet/dry operation means it&#x27;s nice to be able to rinse off when done.  </li>
            <li> I wish I&#x27;d gotten something more reliable.</li>
            <li> These cordless clippers are fantastic!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> The combs have more teeth than competitor&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I stumbled onto this unit before purchasing another brand.</li>
            <li> This thing cuts better than my corded trimmer and more even also.  </li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t have to go to barbars any more.</li>
            <li> Panasonic has always had reputable products so took the plunge and purchased this shaver.  </li>
            <li> but I wish they had more attachments to leave your hair longer.</li>
            <li> but I would buy this unit again unless something better comes along.  </li>
            <li> Trimmer is ok...</li>
            <li> Feels almost like a demo model, but it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> Quiter than most others.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping of better quality by panasonic.</li>
            <li> I love the way this clipper handles.</li>
            <li> I was expecting more quality from Panasonic .....</li>
            <li> Overall though, very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have as many clipping lengths and the blades are flimsy.</li>
            <li> I wish it has more attachments.</li>
            <li> Basically it is perfect for a simple crewcut.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that is rechargable and don&#x27;t have to worry about the cord when trying to reach my husbands hair.</li>
            <li> Glad I chose this product.  </li>
            <li> It enables a 1.6\\&quot; cut, which is longer than most others I have researched.  </li>
            <li> If Panasonic installed double batteries, that would be awesome.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> For beard will be okay.</li>
            <li> and I have had 4 or more since a pair my barber gave me was stolen.  </li>
            <li> I will reserve judgement until more cuts.</li>
            <li> &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> It is a nice clipper as it cuts the hair pretty nice.....</li>
            <li> The process went just fine, very fine</li>
            <li> : I love that it&#x27;s wireless.. easy to use, clean, and charge!</li>
            <li> in the end, a fine product, but make sure you know what you want.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m sure you could probably buy a better model for more money, but for under $50, it&#x27;s well worth the price</li>
            <li> LOVE THE LIGHT WEIGHT AND CORDLESS FEATURES.  </li>
            <li> Easy to clean as well!</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not so easy to tell which end is which.  </li>
            <li> Being able to wash it under the faucet makes for easy clean up.  </li>
            <li> Attachments for hair length are easy to attach or change.</li>
            <li> the guards are easy to change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It fits well in your hand and is easy to control.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fairly easy to master.)  </li>
            <li> I find the attachments easy to interchange.</li>
            <li> This clipper is easy to use and holds a charge well.</li>
            <li> The razor isn&#x27;t as strong as I thought, so you may have to go over some spots if you shave your head..</li>
            <li> Strongly recommended.</li>
            <li> quiet , no vibrations  cuts very good on battery power  easy to maintain clean  </li>
            <li> This product is, in general, a great trimmer.  </li>
            <li> This is exactly what my husband wanted so he can cut his own hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This was the first time I used a clipper for my own hair.  </li>
            <li> and it seems to work fine without pulling on the hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product and it just works fine.</li>
            <li> The product works just fine</li>
            <li> Fortunately, My son is fine with the simplest styles.</li>
            <li> Light and efficient.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I go the clipper, I called support to explain the charger light.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this trimmer for several months and it works great.  </li>
            <li> I use this product periodically for light hair trimming.</li>
            <li> In practice, it&#x27;s a cheaply built piece of crap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great product for the hair and if a short beard is desired.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad it completely belied my expectation - it&#x27;s a really nice clipper.</li>
            <li> It is as good as the old one.</li>
            <li> Light but durable, charges quickly, cuts smoothly and easily, can cut while charging, easy to wash and clean.</li>
            <li> Having had a good experience with Panasonic trimmers in the past, I figured this would be a good replacement.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and came at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> i bought this hair clipper for my dormitory, we had used it for several times, it works good and also easy to control.</li>
            <li> Nevertheless, it is still best handy clipper till now, blades remain sharp, quiet motor, ensure efficient hair cut.</li>
            <li> Keep the blades clean and oiled, and it will run like a champ.</li>
            <li> Anyway, this guy works great for trimming up sideburns for those of us scarred by the &#x27;70s, around the ears in between barber visits, the neck/back, and even the more, ah, see no light areas of the body.  </li>
            <li> Very quiet which was awesome for my 9year old.  </li>
            <li> I took the blades off once to clean it and they rattled ever since.</li>
            <li> overall, VERY LIGHT WEIGHT, very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> It also holds a charge very well and can sit for a month or more and still work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this machine is cool</li>
            <li> So, I taught myself with trimmer, comb/scissors to cut my own hair as well as a professional.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light but powerful.  </li>
            <li> This trimmer is rechargeable and be used with or with out the cord, with a full charge it can give 4 or 5 haircuts, the blades are adjustable and when your done the head can be washed out in the sink...made by Panasonic, it can be used in the u.s. and countries with 210 volt power since it can be adjusted to use any rate of power.</li>
            <li> I grow a full beard, and I like to keep it between an inch or two in length.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s the slide on attachments that, I assume, are for giving people a full haircut.</li>
            <li> When received hair clipper, the feel good and motor so quiet.</li>
            <li> , however, the lower model from this line of trimmers had more blade settings which is a real plus.</li>
            <li> It works fine for the first 20 times or so...</li>
            <li> My seven number selector Wahls battery died and I needed something quickly.  </li>
            <li> but the battery wears out quickly and you will find yourself having to use it plugged in alot.</li>
            <li> The clipper/blade itself is very nice and doesn&#x27;t get caught and \\&quot;yank\\&quot; like other clippers have.  </li>
            <li> Cuts very well, desn&#x27;t pull the hair, easy to operate.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done everything from urban cafe beards to long, bad-boy goats with stubble (not in that order, of course), all perfectly shaped even despite hairs growing in all directions.  </li>
            <li> just fine and is very sturdy</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> Overall, I don&#x27;t like it as it painfully catching hairs, which threaten me whenever I start to use it</li>
            <li> This product was well worth it.</li>
            <li> Great cordless trimmer, I use it for cutting my head every week and it works really good.</li>
            <li> I currently have a beard and this trimmer cut through it quick and easy!  </li>
            <li> Be sure to use the oil after cleaning and let it sit out to dry (alcohol works great in a pinch to dry it before oiling).  </li>
            <li> First of all, its not as quiet as a UFO, but much quieter than most, and way more than a Wahl.  </li>
            <li> It does the job just right.</li>
            <li> I really like the removable clipper head that you can clean out thoroughly.</li>
            <li> If you are going to use these clippers, it&#x27;s best to do it on dry hair (which I am used to clipping wet hair).  </li>
            <li> (more than 3&amp;#34;), this will give you professional looking, consistent cuts.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> This one is very near perfect, except for one detail: The plastic guards are divided into two groups, the ones for long hair and the ones for short hair.</li>
            <li> The unit works fine and all, but the biggest adapter does not cut my hair, and the next smaller one (12mm) is good for my sides, but cuts to short for the top - wish there was an intermediate length to fill that gap.</li>
            <li> I like this because it&#x27;s exactly the tool I needed to keep my beard carved up the right way, and without hassle.</li>
            <li> The clear length guide is easy to install and adjusts by increments which lock in place once the unit is turned on.</li>
            <li> What I expected it to be, and more!</li>
            <li> Good power; safe; easy to clean; just the right size of combs for normal hair and bird cutting, trimming.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s incredibly light, easy to maintain/clean, and strong enough to cut the thicker portions of my hair around the sides and back of my head.  </li>
            <li> When I first turned on the clipper</li>
            <li> It comes with a warranty and seems pretty durable.  </li>
            <li> thanks !</li>
            <li> Panasonic is not my first choice for anything, and I gave up years ago on Philips products.  </li>
            <li> the shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to go outside amazon to find the appropriate charger</li>
            <li> This one after a couple months use only works plugged in, it won&#x27;t hold charge for more than 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> No hair pulling, quieter than my older model, waterproof, and has a 45 min battery for quick nips.</li>
            <li> They still work just as well as they did the first cut.</li>
            <li> It has more than enough power and can be used with or without the cord.  </li>
            <li> but I really appreciate the effort and hardworking!</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked over many brands, and ultimately I picked this clipper.  </li>
            <li> Only thing I wish had was a case or bag to hold all the bits, and a better sealing oil container.  </li>
            <li> The first 6months it worked well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than some clippers that cost double out there.</li>
            <li> After several years, my old Conair clippers didn’t feel like they were giving me a good cut, even with a new blade, and the battery wouldn’t hold a charge worth diddly, so I went on the hunt for a replacement set.</li>
            <li> Nice sturdy build for home use compared to other brands that use cheaper plastic.  </li>
            <li> It doesnt sound powerful at all(very quiet).  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need lithium battery, one hour charge, non-oil self sharpen blade (I got skin irritation always), zoom wheel length setting, I only need a simple good hair clipper.</li>
            <li> Says it&#x27;s quiet and good for his very short cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After I called for customer support they told me the charger model is called WERCA35K7658 and that no other would fit.</li>
            <li> I do not know much about Hair/Beard  Trimmers, but he seems to like this one very much.</li>
            <li> The instructions were good, although I am not sure of the extent to which it can handle water exposure.  </li>
            <li> Panasonic was good in the past, but not this time.  </li>
            <li> This Panasonic is it, very few marketing points but a good hair</li>
            <li> It is quiet, easy to hold, and cuts well.  </li>
            <li> After several times, need take out the blade for clean and reassembly back, but more noise.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and we do the kids&#x27; hair regularly.</li>
            <li> I keep it plugged in at all times except to use it, and about 10-15 minutes is the most I am getting out of a single full-charge.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and very nice handle, but power only last not over 40 minutes, and it&#x27;s not really powerful, if you&#x27;re going to style your hair.</li>
            <li> Quiet, smooth, and painless.</li>
            <li> even when washing with water (cause water doesnt really wash oil)..</li>
            <li> Today I tried it and it worked very well.  </li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t mark it off a star.</li>
            <li> So, my brother really loves this clipper.</li>
            <li> He wants me to buy the blade replacements, so,  I am still looking for the blades or comb for this clipper.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> - I didn&#x27;t expect much from this.    </li>
            <li> Because of its shape and lighter weight, the Panasonic is much easier to hold.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d really recommend this one.</li>
            <li> These are very well built, quality, clippers.</li>
            <li> but it just takes wayyy too much hair off.  </li>
            <li> Also, the last few years, I have been impressed by Panasonic quality, not necessarily their prices.  </li>
            <li> However, this clipper is really inexpensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The included pieces help limit too much hair removal.  </li>
            <li> Worked very well, no complaints.  </li>
            <li> With these clippers I was ready in 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> CUTS VERY CLOSE WITHOUT A GUIDE,  </li>
            <li> I use my trimmer to shave my whole head once a week, so I wanted something that works in the States as well as in Europe or</li>
            <li> Very inefficient in close trimming.</li>
            <li> Turned out to be really reliable.</li>
            <li> It worked very well.</li>
            <li> I used to buy the hair clipper of Wahl and returned it immediately because of too much noise.</li>
            <li> This one is very good.&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li> One of the things I liked about the clippers is that there are 7 lengths total, with only 3 attachments (you use both sides).  </li>
            <li> battery power is good - lasts at least 3 shaves.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got tired of getting haircuts every six weeks that didn&#x27;t make me look as extraordinarily handsome as I was in my youth :).  </li>
            <li> It cleans easy and the battery has had no problem lasting through a normal hair cut (25 mins).  </li>
            <li> This is ok since I am only interested in a simple crewcut.</li>
            <li> But thats a matter of personal preference of being a clean freak.  </li>
            <li> I simply used the blower to clean up my body and deck.</li>
            <li> Granted I grow a thick, full beard, so maybe this isn&#x27;t an issue for most buyers.  </li>
            <li> It did hair cut smoothly and quietly, better even cut within short time, better than my other two Philips clippers (QG 3270 and QC 5340), not pull hair and little noise to be noticed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The clipper is easy to use, and I get about 4 cuts from a single charge.    </li>
            <li> Everyone likes the hair clipper and hopefully will enjoy it for a long time.</li>
            <li> Make sure you press the black button below the clipper in case it stops working.</li>
            <li> I had an older version of this model for 9 years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really surprised on reading mainly positive reviews - based on them</li>
            <li> I was very surprised!  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend these clippers.</li>
            <li> I did not purchase the model he uses because the price is too high for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many beard trimmers over the past 30 years, at least a dozen: I&#x27;ve used the ones that are fantastic for a month or two and then start to lose their battery power, the ones that never have enough power to actually trim a beard and that choose to pull out the hairs instead, the ones that are perfectly powered but where the adjustable teeth keep slipping as you press them against your face, giving you stubble instead of a van dyke.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not a perfect stand-in, but it is a great travel clipper.</li>
            <li> When I first moved to Europe I completely destroyed my old shaver because it was not built to handle the dual voltage (240v here in Europe).  </li>
            <li> I cut my own hair at least monthly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The good:&lt;br /&gt;- 3 attachments will suit most men&#x27;s haircut needs - unless you like your hair really really really short or really long</li>
            <li> Apparently, the light comes on red when the charger is plugged in, but it just stays on.  </li>
            <li> I could go so far as to say the razor would work well enough to give a full cut to the head, although I am too wimpy to try it on myself.  </li>
            <li> Very quiet and powerful.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good, but not great.  </li>
            <li> Unlike other reviewers I&#x27;m fine with this--</li>
            <li> /&gt;Still, it&#x27;s better than most other products I&#x27;ve used, so it&#x27;s hard to be too upset.  </li>
            <li> Have tried a few different models with no luck, this one works great and lasts quite a long time on a charge.</li>
            <li> and I needed to buy a new one.</li>
            <li> and if this model is still around when ever I have need for a new one</li>
            <li> , this is the one I&#x27;ll buy, but seeing as I haven&#x27;t noticed any \\&quot;wear\\&quot; to date on this trimmer, I may not have a need for a new one for some time...</li>
            <li> I could live with that</li>
            <li> I have issues holding clippers at irregular positions, but my new panasonic clipper is easy to use in all odd positions for shaping.</li>
            <li> 14 more words required  , but no more words needed.</li>
            <li> I bought the exact same model 9 months ago as a replacement.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If that is long enough for you, then this product will work just fine.</li>
            <li> It is easy to operate, but a few choices of hair style.</li>
            <li> So far this has been working like a champ</li>
            <li> you wash it,,, and water comes out directly through the bottom.    </li>
            <li> Bought these to replace my old clippers.  </li>
            <li> It offers the longest cut length I could find.</li>
            <li> It can also cut with direct connection to the voltage.</li>
            <li> Had an old Oster shaver that bit the dust.  </li>
            <li> I was looking to replace my old Panasonic rechargeable Hair Clipper that was with me 12 year.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in the military, have thinning hair on top, and been cutting my own hair for about 10 years.  </li>
            <li> Surprised at the quality of a cut this gave.  </li>
            <li> So far holds charge no problem, will see how it holds over time.</li>
            <li> It arrived with a charge, but I decided to let it completely charge overnight before testing it out.  </li>
            <li> It appears to charge, green light on,</li>
            <li> I bought a National (a Panasonic brand only really seen in Japan)</li>
            <li> I compare this to an old Norelco with a rotating dial (1-5 or whatever) that went from 1/16&amp;#34; - 1/2&amp;#34;, and this seems stupid.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> i like the cordless/corded options that it offers and it cuts through my hair with ease.</li>
            <li> The blades move significantly more slowly than my old device, and the device &amp;#34;feels&amp;#34; lower in quality from my old device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only cool thing is that you can rinse the whole thing down without worry.</li>
            <li> Makes for quick work on my beard and the charge last for a long time.</li>
            <li> The clippers are so sharp it made giving hair cuts fun.</li>
            <li> And setting is reliable, mile better than flashy design of Philips: funny zoom setting always change length when operating it, my wife and I had to cut my hair shorter and shorter again and again each time for 10 months, yanked my hair each time,</li>
            <li> and I have to say I am very disappointed and surprised at how many good reviews this product has gotten.  </li>
            <li> I was tired of the loud noise of the new clippers that we had just received not to long ago, and the fact the the teeth on the old clippers liked to bit the skin.</li>
            <li> As I dont for care for black, silver or orange, I just wish it were available in white.</li>
            <li> As for cleaning, as noted I am not sure it can handle complete exposure to water, so I just clean the removable cutter portion, blowing or brushing out the powered portion.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like how hard it is for me to remove the hair from the attachment and how easily it gets stuck in the blade.  </li>
            <li> That left me needing to purchase a new trimmer.</li>
            <li> Also, not particularly sharp.</li>
            <li> The problem is that there is a large gap in length from the short to the long.</li>
            <li> The longer length guard is clear plastic and attaches in a totally different manner than the shorter guards.  </li>
            <li> Not as loud as my last trimmer.</li>
            <li> ALSO VERY QUIET COMPARED TO MY OLD WAHL CLIPPERS.  </li>
            <li> purchased one online that seemed to be the right one it did not fit the ER-CA35.</li>
            <li> : A full charge will last through at least 2 complete haircuts.  </li>
            <li> I chose to pay a little more for this model about 2 and a half years ago and can&#x27;t say enough about this trimmer.  </li>
            <li> , I purchased this one hopefully to get the same feel as my old one.&lt;br /&gt;Indeed, it is, but only sharper; and the handle feels better.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You just have to start very high and work your way down to the length desired.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried at least 5 other models over the years; mostly the cheaper variety of $30 models.  </li>
            <li> My hair cut is to simple and not worth spending $11 plus a tip at a shop every three weeks, this thing paid for itself fast.</li>
            <li> It feels powerful enough, and is quiet, but the shortest attachment is 3/8\\&quot; unless you go down to the bare clippers, and those felt a bit rough to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Reasonable price &amp; does the hair cutting job well, especially with cordless design.&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning is easy.</li>
            <li> : easy to use, cordless, washable, no big noise&lt;br /&gt;Cons: less comb attachments, no favorite color</li>
            <li> This clipper replaced a Wahl rechargeable that stopped holding a charge after less than a year of normal use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> JUST GOT IT TONIGHT AND GAVE MYSELF MY WEEKLY \\&quot; HIGH AND TIGHT \\&quot; CUT.  </li>
            <li> Still can&#x27;t use it without a plastic blade or else it painfully rips out hair, but trimming on the smallest attachment (1/8&amp;#34;) is fine.</li>
            <li> As far as the cutting experience goes, it is easy and painless...</li>
            <li> Dont know how long it will last</li>
            <li> I also like the flat edge along the bottom that helps me keep the blade level while I shave my head.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how long the battery will last.</li>
            <li> too bad because I really liked it when it worked properly.  </li>
            <li> I was wary about this clipper because of reports that the attachments break easily.  </li>
            <li> After my bad experience with both products (the Wahl was super noisy and would become uncomfortably hot in no time - the norelco was pure crap - it wouldn&#x27;t be able to cut through butter )</li>
            <li> My only critique is that the attachments are a little finicky (I believe this was brought up in an earlier review), but since I only use one of them</li>
            <li> Being able to wash the cutting head and blade is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> and I get this product early unnoticed</li>
            <li> I can save tons of money in a long run...</li>
            <li> Tired of scissors and a blade for trimming of body hair, I figure this was worth a go.  </li>
            <li> He says that it takes very short time to recharge comparing to other clippers, and also it can cut five to eight monks&#x27; hair when it is fully charged.</li>
            <li> Simple design, but only a few attachments.  </li>
            <li> The only complaint I have so far is the battery time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Panasonic&#x27;s length choice is limited, but rather functional.</li>
            <li> If Panasonic can redesign this with an easier to replace, normal battery (i.e. let me use my eneloop battery, I would give it 4 stars at least.</li>
            <li> I believe this is the origin of Bigfoot, a human that lived long enough to be covered in hair, but I digress as usual...).  </li>
            <li> but at the same time it started slowing down and pulling the hair when we use it.  </li>
            <li> works well in dry and wet conditions.  </li>
            <li> Typical of Panasonic to have a quiet motor.  </li>
            <li> There is an adequate number of gauges for various cutting lengths of hair or beard.</li>
            <li> At the least, it was a pain going for regular haircuts and paying to have someone to essentially trim my head.  </li>
            <li> Price was reasonable, it was cordless and rechargeable, and had the Panasonic name behind it, so why not.  </li>
            <li> The manual said it may last for a few years depend on usage.</li>
            <li> That was not a very practical suggestion.  </li>
            <li> It was not what I expected to be.&lt;br /&gt;I think the reason that it was not made in JAPAN.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> the only minus is that the led doesn&#x27;t go green when is fully charged...</li>
            <li> Seems a little slow to shave a head at a decent pace.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> The Panasonic does the job and costs less than half of the Braun razor that is similar to the one I had.</li>
            <li> The blade isn’t as wide as my other clippers, but that isn’t an issue.</li>
            <li> adaptor is not very useful</li>
            <li> It can be cleaned with water if you choose to, but I simply remove the cutter each time and blow-out any residual hair clippings carefully  with my shop air compressor,apply a small drop of supplied oil and re-assemble .</li>
            <li> It is lightweight,a slim contour ,sharp and lasted through five haircuts[med.length hair] for me before even appearing to need a re-charge.</li>
            <li> Panasonic may consider adoptors for other lengths.  </li>
            <li> cannot recommend this due to the battery issue.</li>
            <li> Other than that, it works like a dream.</li>
            <li> The clipper has limited hair lenght adjustments and accessories are not available for other lengths.  </li>
            <li> I looked at quite a few YouTube videos and got the idea of using a few layers of different sized attachments.  </li>
            <li> After reading marginal reviews on other rechargeable clippers, I bought this based upon previous experiences with other Panasonic rechargeable products.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that hard to open if you have size 0 philips, but the problem is that it takes a specialized battery</li>
            <li> The spacers for cutting at different length are back to back and so are fewer pieces.  </li>
            <li> The large black adjustable extender is useless.</li>
            <li> The shorter length guards are double-ended (which could be a plus for some people; less stuff to deal with).  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re labeled in black on a black background</li>
            <li> buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It operates very quietly and smoothly; no tearing even of thick hair.</li>
            <li> , I just wanted it in black.</li>
            <li> I had a previous Panasonic Rechargeable Trimmer, also water proof</li>
            <li> Mine goes back, not good at all.</li>
            <li> just wish the blade speed was a little faster.</li>
            <li> Does the trick, just takes a little longer.</li>
            <li> trimmer-- both for hair and for shaving (leaving a little stubble,</li>
            <li> I wanted to replace my Remington with something a little fancier and decided on this Panasonic model.  </li>
            <li> weak battery- fully charged unit works for only maybe 30-40 minutes&lt;</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, it is almost impossible to find the right part anywhere online.</li>
            <li> , you have to charge it everyday.</li>
            <li> I used the scissors that comes with the unit to trim a few places.</li>
            <li> use this trimmer everyday on my beard.</li>
            <li> Recharged - and still dead.  </li>
            <li> The blades cant be adjusted which gives uneven trimming..</li>
            <li> One charge lasts months (while we use it once every few weeks).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After a few months of use I&#x27;ve been very disappointed in the motor - it is too weak to trim my beard without painfully catching hairs!</li>
            <li> The battery was completely incapacitated and rendered the item useless.  </li>
            <li> The ONLY minor issue is that to cut through thicker hair, you probably want it to be fully charged or plugged in while cutting, or it bogs down some.  </li>
            <li> If something bad happens I&#x27;ll right about it and change my review.</li>
            <li> Some other users have complained about the attachments but since I don’t use them I can’t comment on that.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to determine how long a charge lasts due to infrequent use.</li>
            <li> The cutting edges are as sharp as the day I got it a year later - and I cut my hair every 2</li>
            <li> every other model I&#x27;ve had in the past was disappointing and only lasted 2 years tops.  </li>
            <li> When fully charged, still has very little power.  </li>
            <li> I usually keep it plugged in so not sure about the charging capacity.  </li>
            <li> This unit has the look and feel of a professional cutting tool.  </li>
            <li> I went from using a small Remington multi-head groomer to this.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;ALso, a small correction to the Amazon correction: there&#x27;s no dial to change lengths.  </li>
            <li> Directions so small, magnifying glass needed.  </li>
            <li> and I usually need to insist for almost 15 minutes before I get all my hair as I want.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the battery started going bad, and most of the clips for length settings had broken.</li>
            <li> The plastic cutting combs seem a little delicate, but none have broken so far.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair (that shows no signs of thinning or slowing down, alas --</li>
            <li> It is hard to figure out which is the correct one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Quite hard to determine where the stops are with the adjustable comb.</li>
            <li> I bought this device and in for big disappointment.</li>
            <li> Charge only lasts for 35 min of continuous cutting.  </li>
            <li> At least for my type of hair this has been a god send.</li>
            <li> it is so slowly</li>
            <li> The battery started losing charge after about 6 months of heavy use, and I&#x27;ve been using the extended cord plugged in to keep it going, but alas I was tired of it</li>
            <li> The attachments are ridiculous.</li>
            <li> and I get left with an incredibly uneven hair cut that looks absolutely horrible.  </li>
            <li> Therefore, I&#x27;m left with a product that doesn&#x27;t do its job and leaves me looking like an idiot.  </li>
            <li> I am always fearful of purchasing grooming products since my facial hair is thick and course.  </li>
            <li> I have been cutting my hair and the kids for the past 20 years, have had to buy a hair cutter</li>
            <li> This process is incredibly annoying and just plain sucks.  </li>
            <li> Time will tell and I&#x27;ll update this if it fails.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re also somewhat difficult to attach.  </li>
            <li> My expensive Braun razor gave up the ghost</li>
            <li> so sorry</li>
            <li> This item was rendered useless after one use.  </li>
            <li> I have very thin hair</li>
            <li> Hair gets stuck in between the blade and the comb thus preventing from hair cutting.</li>
            <li> I have found that with my hair that trimmers have a tendency to have problems cutting all the hairs evenly.  </li>
            <li> I am using it for my husband&#x27;s hair cleanup trim (after cutting the hair with the scissors), and for one of my cats (shh).</li>
            <li> paper, this isn&#x27;t a bad option.</li>
            <li> what painful experience.</li>
            <li> .... DISAPPOINTED</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> So far this has been working like a champ but the trimmer always sounds like it&#x27;s about to run out of juice.  This just might be the way the trimmer will always run (it&#x27;s never ACTUALLY run out of power) and I can&#x27;t complain about the performance to date.  Time will tell and I&#x27;ll update this if it fails.</li>
            <li> After reading marginal reviews on other rechargeable clippers, I bought this based upon previous experiences with other Panasonic rechargeable products.  I am very pleased.  The clipper is easy to use, and I get about 4 cuts from a single charge.    Simple design, but only a few attachments.  This is ok since I am only interested in a simple crewcut.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for 3 months now and have used it a half-dozen times or so.  This clipper replaced a Wahl rechargeable that stopped holding a charge after less than a year of normal use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Nice size and shape.  It&#x27;s grippable and maneuverable.  I&#x27;ll never get a corded trimmer again.&lt;br /&gt;- The clipper/blade itself is very nice and doesn&#x27;t get caught and \\&quot;yank\\&quot; like other clippers have.  My son and I appreciate that.&lt;br /&gt;- Rechargeability (izzat a word?): A full charge will last through at least 2 complete haircuts.  It also holds a charge very well and can sit for a month or more and still work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- The clip-on guards are a bit fiddly.  The shorter length guards are double-ended (which could be a plus for some people; less stuff to deal with).  They&#x27;re labeled in black on a black background so it&#x27;s not so easy to tell which end is which.  They&#x27;re also somewhat difficult to attach.  The longer length guard is clear plastic and attaches in a totally different manner than the shorter guards.  No idea why they did that.  It clicks into different positions to give you different lengths.  If you never use the shorter guards then that would work great.  But switching back and forth between the different guards is a PITA.  You do get somewhat used to it, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall 4 stars (I&#x27;d give it 4 and 1/2 if Amazon let us give 1/2 stars).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really surprised on reading mainly positive reviews - based on them I bought this device and in for big disappointment. The trimmer cuts the hair only if  there are no attachments on, if you put on combs it drastically slows and if you use the sliding comb it just doesn&#x27;t cut at all. Hair gets stuck in between the blade and the comb thus preventing from hair cutting. Mine goes back, not good at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these clippers for a month now and have given three hair cuts with them and I have to say I am very disappointed and surprised at how many good reviews this product has gotten.  One of the things I liked about the clippers is that there are 7 lengths total, with only 3 attachments (you use both sides).  I found they were very easy to change in and out and I love that there is no cord!  What I dislike about the product, are the actual attachments...yes, I did just say a couple of lines ago that I like them.  What I like is that there are only 3 to keep up with.  What I don&#x27;t like is that you don&#x27;t get an even hair cut with the longer length one (which goes from 1.2\\&quot; to .8\\&quot;  I don&#x27;t like that there are no sizes between .5 and .8 inches.  I don&#x27;t like how hard it is for me to remove the hair from the attachment and how easily it gets stuck in the blade.  If you are going to use these clippers, it&#x27;s best to do it on dry hair (which I am used to clipping wet hair).  I wish I&#x27;d gotten something more reliable.</li>
            <li> I was tired of the loud noise of the new clippers that we had just received not to long ago, and the fact the the teeth on the old clippers liked to bit the skin. These cordless clippers are fantastic! Quiet, smooth, and painless. I couldn&#x27;t ask for more. My hair cut is to simple and not worth spending $11 plus a tip at a shop every three weeks, this thing paid for itself fast. Easy to clean as well!</li>
            <li> I love it.  I use it weekly for cutting my own hair.  Charge is good and it performs well.  No complaints.  It&#x27;s a good quality product.  Solid.  I&#x27;m very glad I found it.  Will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I had a panasonic for 10 years. At the end, the battery died and the razor is not as sharp.&lt;br /&gt;So, I purchased this one hopefully to get the same feel as my old one.&lt;br /&gt;Indeed, it is, but only sharper; and the handle feels better.&lt;br /&gt;It is besic but that is all I need.</li>
            <li> I use it to buzz my head every week.  My only gripe is brushing out the hair off the blade and internals when ur done.  (but thats any clipper)  yes u can wash it out.. and it is designed awesomely... With teh blade out you wash it,,, and water comes out directly through the bottom.    I always oil the blades before i use it so the hair is always sticking to the blades.. even when washing with water (cause water doesnt really wash oil).. so i gota use the mini brush.  But thats a matter of personal preference of being a clean freak.  im sure it works awesomely without the cleaning i give it every time.      Great Clipper overall, VERY LIGHT WEIGHT, very easy to use.  All pros.</li>
            <li> Bought these to replace my old clippers.  I was hoping for something that had 1 adjustable attachment only but couldn&#x27;t find anything. Settled for these ~ which work well but prefer an adjustable clipper.</li>
            <li> The spacers for cutting at different length are back to back and so are fewer pieces.  There is no case or bag to hold everything in once you unpack it, which is not too good.  It does include oil for the blades and works internationally at 100-240 volts.  Definitely a good buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It operates very quietly and smoothly; no tearing even of thick hair.</li>
            <li> This product surpasses all my expectations. I have issues holding clippers at irregular positions, but my new panasonic clipper is easy to use in all odd positions for shaping. The combs have more teeth than competitor&#x27;s products. It offers the longest cut length I could find. I&#x27;m glad I stumbled onto this unit before purchasing another brand.</li>
            <li> Am using the clippers overseas plugged in to a 220V outlet.  I&#x27;ve used these about five times so far and they are good quality and hold a good charge!</li>
            <li> My sister suggested this product to me for my baby&#x27;s hair cut. Today I tried it and it worked very well.  Good product.</li>
            <li> I bought this clipper to use while deployed to the desert, we dont have outlets in the bathrooms here so corded is not an option (220w also).  When I first turned on the clipper my impression was that it was another under powered trimmer that would not work well but that it would hopefully get me through my time here.  It doesnt sound powerful at all(very quiet).  When I went to cut my hair I was very surprised!  This thing cuts better than my corded trimmer and more even also.  It cleans easy and the battery has had no problem lasting through a normal hair cut (25 mins).  If I could improve it I would add a 1.5mm attachment.  If the battery lasts, this a is a great trimmer for the price and the best cordless I have ever seen.</li>
            <li> Ever since I noticed I was going bald I&#x27;ve been shaving my head.  When I first moved to Europe I completely destroyed my old shaver because it was not built to handle the dual voltage (240v here in Europe).  The Panasonic ER-CA35-K is great for travelers as it has dual voltage and is rechargeable.  Being able to wash it under the faucet makes for easy clean up.  My only critique is that the attachments are a little finicky (I believe this was brought up in an earlier review), but since I only use one of them I really can&#x27;t mark it off a star.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it once now and it worked great.  It comes with a warranty and seems pretty durable.  Plus it&#x27;s washable and rechargeable, so it&#x27;s a good buy.</li>
            <li> i bought this hair clipper for my dormitory, we had used it for several times, it works good and also easy to control.</li>
            <li> quiet , no vibrations  cuts very good on battery power  easy to maintain clean  the attachments are perfect !  thanks !</li>
            <li> I used it once and it seems to work fine without pulling on the hair. Washable is a big plus. I would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this clipper for myself, but for my brother who is a monk in India. He is very very very happy with this product. He says that it takes very short time to recharge comparing to other clippers, and also it can cut five to eight monks&#x27; hair when it is fully charged. It can also cut with direct connection to the voltage. So, my brother really loves this clipper. He wants me to buy the blade replacements, so,  I am still looking for the blades or comb for this clipper.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend to all the customers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;I bought another one of this clippers for myself, and I can cut my hair by myself. i don&#x27;t have to go to barbars any more. It saves me $20 per month.</li>
            <li> This clipper is a winner.It is lightweight,a slim contour ,sharp and lasted through five haircuts[med.length hair] for me before even appearing to need a re-charge.Attachments for hair length are easy to attach or change.It cleans very easy.It can be cleaned with water if you choose to, but I simply remove the cutter each time and blow-out any residual hair clippings carefully  with my shop air compressor,apply a small drop of supplied oil and re-assemble . This is simple,just click the cutter back in place.Did i say a WINNER !</li>
            <li> Light and efficient. I bought this rechargeable clipper because I&#x27;m going on a trip. I think it&#x27;s great because it works well and is very light.</li>
            <li> My wife cuts my hair and she loved using these clippers.  It is quiet, easy to hold, and cuts well.  Highly recommend these clippers.</li>
            <li> Had an old Oster shaver that bit the dust.  Panasonic has always had reputable products so took the plunge and purchased this shaver.  So far so good.  I usually keep it plugged in so not sure about the charging capacity.  As far as the cutting experience goes, it is easy and painless...I recommend this.</li>
            <li> using it for 2 weeks now...no problems...no noise...the only minus is that the led doesn&#x27;t go green when is fully charged...it remains red forever</li>
            <li> Pros- Handy, convenient, water-proof, cordless&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons- The razor isn&#x27;t as strong as I thought, so you may have to go over some spots if you shave your head..</li>
            <li> So far so good.  If something bad happens I&#x27;ll right about it and change my review.</li>
            <li> Charges and cuts well.  Charge only lasts for 35 min of continuous cutting.  No carrying case.  Product price dropped after my purchase.</li>
            <li> The clipper has limited hair lenght adjustments and accessories are not available for other lengths.  Panasonic may consider adoptors for other lengths.  Thanks</li>
            <li> I was looking to replace my old Panasonic rechargeable Hair Clipper that was with me 12 year. I found this one and is perfect.</li>
            <li> Have tried a few different models with no luck, this one works great and lasts quite a long time on a charge.</li>
            <li> I cut my own hair at least monthly. Used ER-CA35 for five year and couldn&#x27;t be happier with everything. Just purchased a replacement blade and look forward to another five years...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the replacement blade if anyone is looking for one&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B001J6O0VO B001J6O0VO]]</li>
            <li> this machine is cool: I love that it&#x27;s wireless.. easy to use, clean, and charge! Good Price for this item.. the only thing is that you have to charge for 8 hrs for only a 40 min use. thats why i gave it 4 stars...</li>
            <li> My expensive Braun razor gave up the ghost and I could not find anyplace to have it repaired. The Panasonic does the job and costs less than half of the Braun razor that is similar to the one I had.</li>
            <li> What I expected it to be, and more!</li>
            <li> These are nice clippers but I wish they had more attachments to leave your hair longer. They hold a charge well and I would buy them again.</li>
            <li> Cuts great and has a 1.6 inch max trim piece!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this thing for over a year, and the only reason I&#x27;m not giving it 4 or 5 stars is the battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good:&lt;br /&gt;- 3 attachments will suit most men&#x27;s haircut needs - unless you like your hair really really really short or really long (more than 3&amp;#34;), this will give you professional looking, consistent cuts.&lt;br /&gt;- The cutting edges are as sharp as the day I got it a year later - and I cut my hair every 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad:&lt;br /&gt;- Battery: it&#x27;s NiMH battery that has a specialty attachment. The battery started losing charge after about 6 months of heavy use, and I&#x27;ve been using the extended cord plugged in to keep it going, but alas I was tired of it so I opened it up. It&#x27;s not that hard to open if you have size 0 philips, but the problem is that it takes a specialized battery and it&#x27;s like $15 on eBay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot recommend this due to the battery issue. If Panasonic can redesign this with an easier to replace, normal battery (i.e. let me use my eneloop battery, I would give it 4 stars at least.</li>
            <li> I give this product a 4.5 rating which has been rounded up to 5.  First of all, its not as quiet as a UFO, but much quieter than most, and way more than a Wahl.  My seven number selector Wahls battery died and I needed something quickly.  I trim my hair once a week and am unwilling to pay $7-$20 per haircut, then recut/fix it once I get home.  So, I taught myself with trimmer, comb/scissors to cut my own hair as well as a professional.  This unit is designed to be used by someone else cutting your hair, but with correct handling, you can use it effectively by yourself.  Panasonic is not my first choice for anything, and I gave up years ago on Philips products.  This unit has the look and feel of a professional cutting tool.  The clear length guide is easy to install and adjusts by increments which lock in place once the unit is turned on. When the unit is powered on, the guide cannot be moved. The trick is finding what length to set.  It says 1.6 inches is maximum but in reality, it seems like you could get 3 inches before shearing the tips.  You just have to start very high and work your way down to the length desired.  This is the BEST hair trimmer I have ever used.  I recommend it.  I wanted to purchase this unit at $34 and $37 but (out of stock), so I paid $59, and gladly!  Dont know how long it will last but I would buy this unit again unless something better comes along.  As I dont for care for black, silver or orange, I just wish it were available in white.</li>
            <li> This is quite a good hair clipper. The design and performance are quite satisfactory. Low noise level. Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Great value for the price. Strongly recommended.</li>
            <li> good for the price u paying</li>
            <li> Trimmer is ok... just wish the blade speed was a little faster. Seems a little slow to shave a head at a decent pace.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a lot lighter then it looks. Feels almost like a demo model, but it&#x27;s ok. Does the trick, just takes a little longer.</li>
            <li> The product worked great. For 3 months, then I had a problem with the charger and I needed to buy a new one. That is when my troubles began.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, it is almost impossible to find the right part anywhere online. It is not sold separately in amazon and panasonic has hundreds of chargers and they are not exchangeable. It is hard to figure out which is the correct one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased one online that seemed to be the right one it did not fit the ER-CA35. I had to return and pay for the shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to go outside amazon to find the appropriate charger so I went to the panasonic website. Good luck finding it there. After I called for customer support they told me the charger model is called WERCA35K7658 and that no other would fit. I looked online and it was not sold anywhere else, so I had to buy it from Panasonic website. It costed me 44.28 U$.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck with that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in the military, have thinning hair on top, and been cutting my own hair for about 10 years.  I&#x27;ve tried at least 5 other models over the years; mostly the cheaper variety of $30 models.  I chose to pay a little more for this model about 2 and a half years ago and can&#x27;t say enough about this trimmer.  It&#x27;s incredibly light, easy to maintain/clean, and strong enough to cut the thicker portions of my hair around the sides and back of my head.  The ONLY minor issue is that to cut through thicker hair, you probably want it to be fully charged or plugged in while cutting, or it bogs down some.  I cut my hair once every two weeks, so have used this for probably 60 hair cuts and no \\&quot;dulling\\&quot; of the blades whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure you could probably buy a better model for more money, but for under $50, it&#x27;s well worth the price and if this model is still around when ever I have need for a new one, this is the one I&#x27;ll buy, but seeing as I haven&#x27;t noticed any \\&quot;wear\\&quot; to date on this trimmer, I may not have a need for a new one for some time...every other model I&#x27;ve had in the past was disappointing and only lasted 2 years tops.  Great product!</li>
            <li> Best trimmer on the market. I had an older version of this model for 9 years. It&#x27;s still working well, I just wanted it in black.</li>
            <li> This thing is the bomb. Keep the blades clean and oiled, and it will run like a champ.</li>
            <li> Cuts very well, desn&#x27;t pull the hair, easy to operate.  Quiter than most others.  I am very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> no complaints - great product.  used it for over 6 months.  works well in dry and wet conditions.  battery power is good - lasts at least 3 shaves.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend as a Christmas present. I do not know much about Hair/Beard  Trimmers, but he seems to like this one very much.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product and it just works fine. Make sure you press the black button below the clipper in case it stops working. Besides that no issues at all</li>
            <li> I had a previous Panasonic Rechargeable Trimmer, also water proof and I loved it! It lasted like 3 year, the battery life was great. This one after a couple months use only works plugged in, it won&#x27;t hold charge for more than 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after buying two different clippers - the Norelco bodygroom and a Wahl clipper kit. After my bad experience with both products (the Wahl was super noisy and would become uncomfortably hot in no time - the norelco was pure crap - it wouldn&#x27;t be able to cut through butter ) - I didn&#x27;t expect much from this.    I&#x27;m glad it completely belied my expectation - it&#x27;s a really nice clipper. It runs very silently and the blade is first-class - there&#x27;s no pulling or pinching. It has good heft in the hands and is very easy to maneuver. Also, it has multiple clip-ons for a variety of cut-lengths. It&#x27;s perfect if you want to give yourself a quick buzz-cut.     Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> great, gets the job done</li>
            <li> I have been cutting my hair and the kids for the past 20 years, have had to buy a hair cutter every 2,3, years. No cutter has been as good as this one. Good power; safe; easy to clean; just the right size of combs for normal hair and bird cutting, trimming.</li>
            <li> I went from using a small Remington multi-head groomer to this.  This is great it. handles all your grooming needs and you can use it in the shower.  You could use it to buzz cut your hair if you wanted to or give someone a haircut if you have the skill.  My barber uses a similar Panasonic.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend to spend on this one. It does not have good result. I was hoping of better quality by panasonic.</li>
            <li> I searched all of amazon for the perfect hair trimmer, as I imagine most of you do. This one is very near perfect, except for one detail: The plastic guards are divided into two groups, the ones for long hair and the ones for short hair. The problem is that there is a large gap in length from the short to the long. So, if you use the shortest long-hair guard and try to follow up with the longest short-hair guard, there is like a 5mm difference in the cuts. Other than that, it works like a dream. No hair pulling, quieter than my older model, waterproof, and has a 45 min battery for quick nips.</li>
            <li> Somehow I got it into my had that this would be a good multi-purpose trimmer-- both for hair and for shaving (leaving a little stubble, which is what I want.)  It feels powerful enough, and is quiet, but the shortest attachment is 3/8\\&quot; unless you go down to the bare clippers, and those felt a bit rough to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ALso, a small correction to the Amazon correction: there&#x27;s no dial to change lengths.  Unlike other reviewers I&#x27;m fine with this-- the guards are easy to change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in the end, a fine product, but make sure you know what you want.  I think this one-- [[ASIN:B000F4USF8 Panasonic ER224S All-in-One Cordless Hair and Beard Trimmer (Silver)]]--  is closer to what I was looking for-- I&#x27;ll give it a try!</li>
            <li> I love the way this clipper handles. It fits well in your hand and is easy to control. There is an adequate number of gauges for various cutting lengths of hair or beard. The clipper design and quality is excellent, but you have to be the one to make sure of good cuts. Saves me trips to the barber and satisfies my needs for personal grooming.</li>
            <li> Overall, I don&#x27;t like it as it painfully catching hairs, which threaten me whenever I start to use it (is there any way to fix this?). I was expecting more quality from Panasonic .....Final word .... DISAPPOINTED</li>
            <li> After several years, my old Conair clippers didn’t feel like they were giving me a good cut, even with a new blade, and the battery wouldn’t hold a charge worth diddly, so I went on the hunt for a replacement set. Decided on the Panasonic after reading reviews and feel like I made a good decision. Because of its shape and lighter weight, the Panasonic is much easier to hold. The blade isn’t as wide as my other clippers, but that isn’t an issue. I also like the flat edge along the bottom that helps me keep the blade level while I shave my head. Some other users have complained about the attachments but since I don’t use them I can’t comment on that. Overall though, very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> it is so slowly i don&#x27;t like it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so sorry but this is my opinion, and i thought its good. I hope to change it.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what my husband wanted so he can cut his own hair. It does the job just right.</li>
            <li> Not what I was looking for to replace the Braun cruzer.  It doesn&#x27;t have as many clipping lengths and the blades are flimsy.</li>
            <li> I see the guy who cut my hair has nothing but Panasonic clippers and decieded to try it out. I did not purchase the model he uses because the price is too high for me. This fits perfectly in our budget. We now happily use it on all our kids. I wish it has more attachments. Basically it is perfect for a simple crewcut.</li>
            <li> I got this to do my husbands hair. It works great. I love the fact that is rechargable and don&#x27;t have to worry about the cord when trying to reach my husbands hair. It is and excellent hair clipper.</li>
            <li> I was wary about this clipper because of reports that the attachments break easily.  However I&#x27;ve had it for a while now and am finding it really simple. It&#x27;s light but powerful.  I really like the removable clipper head that you can clean out thoroughly. My wife cuts my hair so she appreciates the ease of moving around with a cordless clipper that fits the hand well.  I&#x27;d really recommend this one.</li>
            <li> I purchased these a while back and have used them 3 or 4 times. They still work just as well as they did the first cut.</li>
            <li> Surprised at the quality of a cut this gave.  I am always fearful of purchasing grooming products since my facial hair is thick and course.  I cannot even use electric shavers for that reason.  I currently have a beard and this trimmer cut through it quick and easy!  I am very impressed!  Definitely, a good buy.</li>
            <li> These are very well built, quality, clippers. Very happy with my purchase and shipping. In the short time we have had them I have touched up my side-cut and my husband has trimmed his beard multiple times.</li>
            <li> I see my beard as a kind of topiary, and like to change its contours quite often. I&#x27;ve used many beard trimmers over the past 30 years, at least a dozen: I&#x27;ve used the ones that are fantastic for a month or two and then start to lose their battery power, the ones that never have enough power to actually trim a beard and that choose to pull out the hairs instead, the ones that are perfectly powered but where the adjustable teeth keep slipping as you press them against your face, giving you stubble instead of a van dyke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about 2 months, it seems that this is probably the perfect trimmer for me.  Its guides don&#x27;t slip, since two of the three are reversible and lock into place, and can&#x27;t possibly slip.  (By the way, I don&#x27;t find this procedure overly daunting.  It&#x27;s fairly easy to master.)  The third guide, with the longer lengths, does have a sliding adjustment, but it seems to stay in place quite well, with a push button lock.  It has more than enough power and can be used with or without the cord.  It&#x27;s quiet enough to not wake the neighbors.  And it has a great range of lengths. I&#x27;ve done everything from urban cafe beards to long, bad-boy goats with stubble (not in that order, of course), all perfectly shaped even despite hairs growing in all directions.  I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
            <li> Glad I chose this product.  Wet/dry capablity, quiet motor, clip-on quides lower the risk of screwing up.  Good for head, beard or body.</li>
            <li> Bought for my son who had somewhat of the same model in Japan while on his mission.  Works great and he&#x27;ll be using them for college. No issues with the item.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is rechargeable and be used with or with out the cord, with a full charge it can give 4 or 5 haircuts, the blades are adjustable and when your done the head can be washed out in the sink...made by Panasonic, it can be used in the u.s. and countries with 210 volt power since it can be adjusted to use any rate of power. For the price it runs rings around corded trimers, I bought it for my son who is a great barber...</li>
            <li> The product works just fine and I get this product early unnoticed but I really appreciate the effort and hardworking! Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> It is good. However Im not 100% believe it water proof. The battery not works well, you have to charge it everyday.</li>
            <li> Directions so small, magnifying glass needed.  14 more words required  , but no more words needed. What else is there to say.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no stranger to cutting my own hair - I&#x27;ve been doing it for about 4 years.  I wanted to replace my Remington with something a little fancier and decided on this Panasonic model.  I have a Panasonic wet/dry razor for my face that I love, so I decided to go with another Panasonic model, but I made the wrong decision - I regret this decision to this day!  This trimmer has made me go back to a shop so I didn&#x27;t have to deal with this anymore.  Stay away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Good:&lt;br /&gt;Battery life is nice, have never had a problem with it running out on me.  That&#x27;s about it...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad:&lt;br /&gt;My problem is that when you use the shortest setting of the longest attachment, it perfectly catches the hair inside the attachment and COMPLETELY blocks the blades.  When the blades are blocked it doesn&#x27;t cut...at all!  I have to manual use the cleaner brush after every run through my hair to try to get enough hair out to cut.  This process is incredibly annoying and just plain sucks.  I can&#x27;t get all the hair out and I get left with an incredibly uneven hair cut that looks absolutely horrible.  I&#x27;ve tried to use the next smaller setting but it just takes wayyy too much hair off.  Therefore, I&#x27;m left with a product that doesn&#x27;t do its job and leaves me looking like an idiot.  I wish I could return it but I&#x27;ve used it twice and have thrown away the box, otherwise I would have.  Unless you&#x27;re buying it as a paperweight, stay away.</li>
            <li> The unit works fine and all, but the biggest adapter does not cut my hair, and the next smaller one (12mm) is good for my sides, but cuts to short for the top - wish there was an intermediate length to fill that gap. Shame, because otherwise it&#x27;s a good hair clipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROs:&lt;br /&gt;well build and solid construction&lt;br /&gt;good blades&lt;br /&gt;nice smaller adaptors (3,6,9,12 mm)&lt;br /&gt;works while plugged into charger&lt;br /&gt;nice quiet operation&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONs:&lt;br /&gt;somewhat weak battery- fully charged unit works for only maybe 30-40 minutes&lt;br /&gt;longest adaptor is not very useful&lt;br /&gt;would benefit from some intermediate length adaptors (maybe 15mm and 20mm)</li>
            <li> Reasonable price &amp; does the hair cutting job well, especially with cordless design.&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning is easy. Hopefully it can last.</li>
            <li> Light but durable, charges quickly, cuts smoothly and easily, can cut while charging, easy to wash and clean. This product was well worth it. No cons.</li>
            <li> The clippers are so sharp it made giving hair cuts fun. The motor is very quiet. Very easy to handle.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B002GKC3MU Panasonic Rechargeable Hair Clipper ER-CA35-K]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got tired of getting haircuts every six weeks that didn&#x27;t make me look as extraordinarily handsome as I was in my youth :).  At the least, it was a pain going for regular haircuts and paying to have someone to essentially trim my head.  I also wanted some control of the length of my hair -- not a buzz cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked over many brands, and ultimately I picked this clipper.  It enables a 1.6\\&quot; cut, which is longer than most others I have researched.  Also, the last few years, I have been impressed by Panasonic quality, not necessarily their prices.  However, this clipper is really inexpensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I go the clipper, I called support to explain the charger light.  This was not explained in the short user&#x27;s manual.  Apparently, the light comes on red when the charger is plugged in, but it just stays on.  I was told to simply charge it each time for about 8 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was the first time I used a clipper for my own hair.  I looked at quite a few YouTube videos and got the idea of using a few layers of different sized attachments.  I used three sizes, ranging from 1/2\\&quot; to 1.6\\&quot;.  I went outside on a deck with the unit, a hand mirror and a lawn blower.  I used the scissors that comes with the unit to trim a few places. The process went just fine, very fine I must say.  I simply used the blower to clean up my body and deck.</li>
            <li> It did hair cut smoothly and quietly, better even cut within short time, better than my other two Philips clippers (QG 3270 and QC 5340), not pull hair and little noise to be noticed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Panasonic&#x27;s length choice is limited, but rather functional. And setting is reliable, mile better than flashy design of Philips: funny zoom setting always change length when operating it, my wife and I had to cut my hair shorter and shorter again and again each time for 10 months, yanked my hair each time, what painful experience. I don&#x27;t need lithium battery, one hour charge, non-oil self sharpen blade (I got skin irritation always), zoom wheel length setting, I only need a simple good hair clipper. This Panasonic is it, very few marketing points but a good hair clipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[update 2014-4-12] Battery is quite so so, I have to charge a couple of hours each time before hair cut. Nevertheless, it is still best handy clipper till now, blades remain sharp, quiet motor, ensure efficient hair cut. If Panasonic installed double batteries, that would be awesome.</li>
            <li> It is a nice clipper as it cuts the hair pretty nice.....personally I like it a lot,only wish there was a way to adjust the clipper blade so as to trim the sides of the hair that&#x27;s for shaping the hair.....but overall....its good!</li>
            <li> It was a gift for my dad&#x27;s birthday. He loves it. Says it&#x27;s quiet and good for his very short cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glad with the buy</li>
            <li> Bottom line:  I grow a full beard, and I like to keep it between an inch or two in length.  Narrower trimmers with shorter attachment never cut it, and I refuse to stand in front of the mirror trimming and snipping with scissors and a comb.  This product is, in general, a great trimmer.  But I&#x27;ve had a lot of great trimmers.  I like this because it&#x27;s exactly the tool I needed to keep my beard carved up the right way, and without hassle.</li>
            <li> The cordless idea is great. Love it. So far holds charge no problem, will see how it holds over time.</li>
            <li> It works fine for the first 20 times or so...but the battery wears out quickly and you will find yourself having to use it plugged in alot. The large black adjustable extender is useless. The only cool thing is that you can rinse the whole thing down without worry.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and very nice handle, but power only last not over 40 minutes, and it&#x27;s not really powerful, if you&#x27;re going to style your hair. For beard will be okay.</li>
            <li> I have found that with my hair that trimmers have a tendency to have problems cutting all the hairs evenly.  This one came the closest and I have had 4 or more since a pair my barber gave me was stolen.  I will reserve judgement until more cuts.</li>
            <li> Great looking, comfy, speedy, portable, just a great all around hair trimmer. At least for my type of hair this has been a god send. Great product from Panasonic. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my son and he loves it.</li>
            <li> ....very good clippers.....use all the time....</li>
            <li> use this trimmer everyday on my beard. works as it should and no complaints.</li>
            <li> Tired of scissors and a blade for trimming of body hair, I figure this was worth a go.  Price was reasonable, it was cordless and rechargeable, and had the Panasonic name behind it, so why not.  It arrived with a charge, but I decided to let it completely charge overnight before testing it out.  The instructions were good, although I am not sure of the extent to which it can handle water exposure.  Obviously a full dunking is not recommended, but I do not see any gaskets leading me to assume the water is best kept away from the battery portion.  I have thick hair (that shows no signs of thinning or slowing down, alas -- I believe this is the origin of Bigfoot, a human that lived long enough to be covered in hair, but I digress as usual...).  Anyway, this guy works great for trimming up sideburns for those of us scarred by the &#x27;70s, around the ears in between barber visits, the neck/back, and even the more, ah, see no light areas of the body.  The included pieces help limit too much hair removal.  I could go so far as to say the razor would work well enough to give a full cut to the head, although I am too wimpy to try it on myself.  As for cleaning, as noted I am not sure it can handle complete exposure to water, so I just clean the removable cutter portion, blowing or brushing out the powered portion.  Be sure to use the oil after cleaning and let it sit out to dry (alcohol works great in a pinch to dry it before oiling).  The charge lasts for months, unless you are Bigfoot, I imagine.  Only thing I wish had was a case or bag to hold all the bits, and a better sealing oil container.  Otherwise, recommended.</li>
            <li> About 18 months ago I bought this rechargeable trimmer to buzz cut my own hair.  Worked very well, no complaints.  One day - it just stopped working.  Recharged - and still dead.  Since I already had the attachments to it, and since I couldn&#x27;t figure out how to complain to Panasonic - I bought the exact same model 9 months ago as a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two days ago, after having been charged - it wouldn&#x27;t turn on.  It appears to charge, green light on, etc.  But it just doesn&#x27;t work.  Dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can fool me once, and Panasonic fooled me twice on this.  Not a 3rd time.</li>
            <li> Easy to used , battery life excellent&lt;br /&gt;I highly recomend the product the best trimmer I ever own.&lt;br /&gt;great price as well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this trimmer for several months and it works great.  Being able to wash the cutting head and blade is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I like the low noise level. Not as loud as my last trimmer. Makes for quick work on my beard and the charge last for a long time.</li>
            <li> The actuall product doesn&#x27;t call it a trimmer. Instead its called clipper. I thought of buying a trimmer and felt dissapointed.</li>
            <li> if you want a shaver that doesn&#x27;t need hours of recharging each time you want to use it, don&#x27;t get this one.  When fully charged, still has very little power.  Why the attachments?  It can&#x27;t handle them. Panasonic was good in the past, but not this time.  Also, not particularly sharp.</li>
            <li> I just purchased these clippers and I&#x27;m amazed with the result. I have very thin hair and I usually need to insist for almost 15 minutes before I get all my hair as I want. With these clippers I was ready in 5 minutes. Awesome!</li>
            <li> This is the best hair clipper so far. I wish I had ordered sooner. Well built and bargain price. I can save tons of money in a long run...my son and my own hair cuts.</li>
            <li> I bought this clipper october 7th 2012, but it stop working only after using one time. I don&#x27;t know why.</li>
            <li> Great cordless trimmer, I use it for cutting my head every week and it works really good. Also is portable so is great for traveling.</li>
            <li> GREAT CLIPPER.  JUST GOT IT TONIGHT AND GAVE MYSELF MY WEEKLY \\&quot; HIGH AND TIGHT \\&quot; CUT.  LOVE THE LIGHT WEIGHT AND CORDLESS FEATURES.  CUTS VERY CLOSE WITHOUT A GUIDE,  ALSO VERY QUIET COMPARED TO MY OLD WAHL CLIPPERS.  ADD A DROP OR TWO OF OIL BEFORE EACH USE FOR BEST RESULTS,  I USE GUNZILLA GUN OIL ON MINE.</li>
            <li> The first 6months it worked well. Very quiet which was awesome for my 9year old.  After about 6months, it would not keep a charge so only way it will work was pugged.  I could live with that but at the same time it started slowing down and pulling the hair when we use it.  I tried everything from cleanning with water and blowers... if you run it through water it works well for about 5seconds and goes back to pulling.&lt;br /&gt;Its too bad because I really liked it when it worked properly.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it from my experience.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and came at a reasonable price. Did not have to buy unwanted accessories. Got just what I needed.</li>
            <li> I bought a National (a Panasonic brand only really seen in Japan) a decade ago.  Unfortunately, the battery started going bad, and most of the clips for length settings had broken. That left me needing to purchase a new trimmer. Having had a good experience with Panasonic trimmers in the past, I figured this would be a good replacement. It&#x27;s good, but not great.  The blades move significantly more slowly than my old device, and the device &amp;#34;feels&amp;#34; lower in quality from my old device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, it&#x27;s better than most other products I&#x27;ve used, so it&#x27;s hard to be too upset.  It&#x27;s just not as good as the one I had before, which was brilliant. Also, it&#x27;s still cheaper than paying for haircuts, so that&#x27;s good!</li>
            <li> I use this product periodically for light hair trimming. I find the attachments easy to interchange. However, the 3/6mm seems to work the best for me. It is difficult to determine how long a charge lasts due to infrequent use. Maintenance after use is no problem. I recommend this Panasonic Trimmer as it does what it supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Have 2 years, still work like new.&lt;br /&gt;Battery works nice. Always using it under shower.&lt;br /&gt;Battery last for two beard trimming and 2 time head.&lt;br /&gt;Quite sound&lt;br /&gt;I give 10+</li>
            <li> I have tried like 5 of them before getting to this one. It&#x27;s the best of all by far. Don&#x27;t get fooled by it&#x27;s price. It&#x27;s better than some clippers that cost double out there.</li>
            <li> It works and serve its purpose. Very quiet and powerful. It did an excellent cut for me and my son. It is a rechargeable and I don&#x27;t know how long the battery will last. The manual said it may last for a few years depend on usage.</li>
            <li> Bought this clipper to replace a Wahl corded unit.  The Wahl cut better, but the cord was difficult to manage.&lt;br /&gt;Love the cordless feature.  The snap on combs work well!</li>
            <li> Typical of Panasonic to have a quiet motor.  Its like the Lexus of electronic products.  Nice sturdy build for home use compared to other brands that use cheaper plastic.  Good ergonomic design that fits snugly in your hands for do it yourself trimming.  Ease of use even when trimming the back of your head.  Quite hard to determine where the stops are with the adjustable comb.</li>
            <li> I use my trimmer to shave my whole head once a week, so I wanted something that works in the States as well as in Europe or wherever else I may find myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On paper, this isn&#x27;t a bad option. Dual-voltage, multiple attachments, wet/dry. In practice, it&#x27;s a cheaply built piece of crap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The attachments are ridiculous. There&#x27;s the slide on attachments that, I assume, are for giving people a full haircut. I can&#x27;t imagine ever wanting to use that. The shorter attachments that people might actually use are separate pieces that you have to slide on. I compare this to an old Norelco with a rotating dial (1-5 or whatever) that went from 1/16&amp;#34; - 1/2&amp;#34;, and this seems stupid.&lt;br /&gt;- Build quality is crap. I took the blades off once to clean it and they rattled ever since. This was what led me to return it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my search for a dual-voltage clipper, I ultimately went with the Wahl Half-Pint. Not a perfect stand-in, but it is a great travel clipper.</li>
            <li> When received hair clipper, the feel good and motor so quiet. After several times, need take out the blade for clean and reassembly back, but more noise.Because the two steel clips no stronger enough and can not hold trim blade set properly.  But still acceptable.</li>
            <li> Very inefficient in close trimming. The blades cant be adjusted which gives uneven trimming.. hair can get stuck in the blade which sometimes cause bleeding too. DO NOT BUY</li>
            <li> The trimmer required a converter plug to use it in a standard American electrical outlet.  I notified the vendor of the problem and he suggested that I go out and buy a converter plug at an electronic store nearest to my home.  That was not a very practical suggestion.  He sent the converter plug. The trimmer works  just fine and is very sturdy, however, the lower model from this line of trimmers had more blade settings which is a real plus.</li>
            <li> Was looking for a trimmer that allows charge while in use, and this product does! Besides, it&#x27;s got quite some helpful reviews, and I have faith in Panasonic products. Turned out to be really reliable. One charge lasts months (while we use it once every few weeks).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I am using it for my husband&#x27;s hair cleanup trim (after cutting the hair with the scissors), and for one of my cats (shh).</li>
            <li> Great product for the hair and if a short beard is desired. DO not buy thinking it good for longer beards, 1 1/2&amp;#34; longest attachment.</li>
            <li> It does the job. It cuts my hair well enough and I appreciate the wet/dry of it. The only complaint I have so far is the battery time. I keep it plugged in at all times except to use it, and about 10-15 minutes is the most I am getting out of a single full-charge. If that is long enough for you, then this product will work just fine. If not, you might want to keep looking.</li>
            <li> This clipper is easy to use and holds a charge well. The plastic cutting combs seem a little delicate, but none have broken so far.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and we do the kids&#x27; hair regularly. Everyone likes the hair clipper and hopefully will enjoy it for a long time.</li>
            <li> Works Great... I Like How the Adjustments work. I would Buy it again in a second, Best hair Trimmer I&#x27;ve Ever Had !!</li>
            <li> I was happy with my Wahl shaver but after moving overseas I needed to switch to a dual voltage shaver.  After a few months of use I&#x27;ve been very disappointed in the motor - it is too weak to trim my beard without painfully catching hairs! Granted I grow a thick, full beard, so maybe this isn&#x27;t an issue for most buyers.  On the plus side, compared to the Wahl the wet/dry operation means it&#x27;s nice to be able to rinse off when done.  --- 10/30/2015 Update Still using this shaver, so I boosted to four stars. Still can&#x27;t use it without a plastic blade or else it painfully rips out hair, but trimming on the smallest attachment (1/8&amp;#34;) is fine. I wish there was a 1/16th attachment though.</li>
            <li> Good product .. I thought it can be used for beards too but it can&#x27;t ..</li>
            <li> It was not what I expected to be.&lt;br /&gt;I think the reason that it was not made in JAPAN.&lt;br /&gt;But it works and does the job.</li>
            <li> This is the second Panasonic hair clipper we bought. It is as good as the old one. The quality is excellent. I used it to cut the hair of my son. It worked very well. It is easy to operate, but a few choices of hair style. Fortunately, My son is fine with the simplest styles. I used to buy the hair clipper of Wahl and returned it immediately because of too much noise. This one is very good.&lt;br /&gt;Pros: easy to use, cordless, washable, no big noise&lt;br /&gt;Cons: less comb attachments, no favorite color</li>
            <li> i use these clippers to cut my own hair its a great pair of clippers. i like the cordless/corded options that it offers and it cuts through my hair with ease. i would get a pair of these again.</li>
            <li> This item was rendered useless after one use.  The battery was completely incapacitated and rendered the item useless.  I would not recommend buying this item.</li>
            <li> i love it ,, i use it for trimming mostly and it does the job perfectly ,, i recommend it for everyone</li>
