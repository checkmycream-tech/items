            <li> Product works great and also has a nice fragrance.  I would definitely recommend this product</li>
            <li> Good for dry curly hair, hair becomes very stiff after a few minutes on applying to hair</li>
            <li> My 11 year old son loves this product!</li>
            <li> Great smell but flaky sometimes.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my 10 yr old nephew and he loves it. He was so happy. And that is all that matters</li>
            <li> Great product.  This is the only gel that does not turn my hair white and flaky.  I can put a hat on and when I take it off, my hair is not crusty.  Same goes for when I wake up in the morning.  Love this gel!</li>
            <li> Excellent for spiking short hair (especially fine hair)</li>
            <li> This gel does a great job of holding hair in place.  My husband uses it and there is never any flaking or bad odor from the gel.  He really likes it and uses it everyday.  Would recommend this gel for anyone who needs their hair to stay in place for the whole day even when you have to put a hat on.</li>
            <li> I found out about this product from a Doctor/Dentist I know.  He was using this.  I tried the mousse, other gels, and hair spray.  They would either leave flakes in my hair, dry up and not hold, and/or smell somewhat unpleasant.  And the cost was much higher.  When I tried this...this product did hold very well and did not flake when it dried up, last a long time (depending on how much I used), did not leave a residue of any kind nor did it smell unpleasant.  I have no clue what it is made from...and I frankly don&#x27;t care.  It comes off very easily in the shower and the price is very reasonable. I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2-3 months now (6-23-14).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:  Does not leave a residue&lt;br /&gt;  Does hold well...all day with moderate amount&lt;br /&gt;  No bad odor&lt;br /&gt;  Comes off easily in the shower&lt;br /&gt;  Easy to use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note:  I preferred the tube to the huge tub is because I wanted a better control of amount I wanted to use, ease of use and close cap compared to the tub, easy to carry with you and put in bag (if you travel).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:  NONE</li>
            <li> I love this product on my fianc&amp;eacute; and sons hair.  Great hold without the flakes and smells nice!  Worth the price and beats the rest of those over priced hair products!</li>
            <li> Best gel out there in my opinion for the natural look. Also you can rewet it in the event hair gets a little frizzy and you can be looking fresh instantly again</li>
            <li> Found this in a smaller tube here, yay!  My stylist uses this but in a bigger container that would take me forever to use so this is perfect!</li>
            <li> Hold is great, last long and there is NO flaking. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> the only gel i use.  it does have strong scent.  I like it.</li>
            <li> Took quite awhile for product to get to me but works great!</li>
            <li> Good hold but made my head itch.</li>
            <li> best gel i have ever had i enjoy it very much</li>
            <li> Great product. Holds well without looking to thick. Worth the price. Only gel my husband will use. Smells nice too</li>

            <li> This stuff is awesome.  Smells great, holds great without getting crispy.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for almost 2 months I love it.&lt;br /&gt; smells very good, lost long and doesn&#x27;t flake.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, no build up or flaking can reset and style throughout day  not greasy and adds volume!</li>
            <li> Works great. Love the smell. Perfect for my sons hair. But shipping was extremely slow took over 2 weeks</li>
