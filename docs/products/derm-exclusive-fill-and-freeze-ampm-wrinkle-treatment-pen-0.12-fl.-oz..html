            <li>but it will with consistent use help keep those deep groves at bay.  </li>
            <li>Thanks so much for finally offering something that actually visibly works.  </li>
            <li>I use very little and then don&#x27;t need any eye make-up if you apply it right.</li>

            <li> Definitely don&#x27;t waste your money on this overpriced</li>
            <li> Waste of money..</li>
            <li> There is very little serum in the tube, and it come out on the side instead of the tip.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> This product is a hoax and a waste of money.</li>
            <li> This product works really well but it&#x27;s not prime eligible and the price is double the cost!!! What&#x27;s the point?</li>
            <li> I ordered the whole kit and saw no change what-so-ever.  When I used the Fill &amp; Freeze it tinted my skin just enough to give me dark circles around my eyes.  I had to wash it off.  I tried it more than once because I wanted to be sure I wasn&#x27;t applying too much but had the same experience each time.</li>
            <li> I really could see a difference after using this product. Fine lines do seem to fill in.</li>
            <li> Wonderful Results. Great Product that I will continue to buy again, &amp; again.  This really does reduce the signs of aging.  There are so many Companies out there trying to make us all believe they have the best, but they don&#x27;t.  This product is much different.  After just a few uses I began to actually see the changes that were beginning to take effect on my Skin.  This is the ONE.  You gotta give this a try, and stay with it too.  The more times you use it, the better the results.  Now we know that we won&#x27;t see results right away; and that&#x27;s how it should be.  It takes just a little bit of time and before you know it, you&#x27;ll look in the Mirror and see for yourself; just how Wonderful this really is and how nicely it REALLY does work.  I have used several of them now and I will keep using it.  Thanks so much for finally offering something that actually visibly works.  I AM TRULY AMAZED!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Have not used long enough to give an honest rating........stay tuned!!</li>
            <li> Saw no difference at all. Disappointed to say the least.</li>
            <li> BEWARE! DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY! Does NOT work at all... not in the slightest!</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of products &amp; I can say it really works!  I have 3 others tried it &amp; they were happy with the results! ♡</li>
            <li> It did not do a thing for me or the other three people who I let try it.I feel like I have been scam .Oh well</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t see any change.  Lot of money for a lot of nothing.</li>
            <li> This was a waste of money. Did absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li> I was worried it wouldn&#x27;t work… But it does!  It Really Works!</li>
            <li> Way too expensive.  I use the derma e deep wrinkle peptide serum which has matrixyl and argireline like this one but it also has synthe 6.  Nothing is a miracle worker but certain ingredients will help you look your best and these are what about there right now for wrinkle serums.  Those infomercials for this product are a joke, nothing smooths you out like that but it will with consistent use help keep those deep groves at bay.  The Derma e version is a good price and quantity. Definitely don&#x27;t waste your money on this overpriced</li>
            <li> I think this works well.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. I&#x27;ve been using it and it definitely makes a difference in the under area of your eyes.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be conned! There is very little serum in the tube, and it come out on the side instead of the tip. The &amp;#34;doctor&amp;#34; who is pushing these products is trying to make money from his appearance on the doctors program.  I&#x27;ll bet that if they discussed the product on the show, he would be laughed off the air. I did not want to give this product any stars,but it is required that one give a star rating for submission.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was a product similar to this out years ago. It was MUCH cheaper, but it did not work either.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product plus all the products in the kit I ordered. I well know that nothing works instantly and has to be allowed months to see full benefit, I can say that I do see results. My problem with the fill and freeze is that it is extremely difficult to get out of the bottle and the new tube. Not much product in container either.</li>
            <li> Waste of money..Did not work at all!!!!</li>
            <li> I saw this on a commercial while waiting at the dentist office . It&#x27;s amazing ! I just ordered my third one . Everyone at work asks what I&#x27;ve done ! It doesn&#x27;t leave a residue at all !</li>
            <li> Quick service however product sucks.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t spend your money!</li>
            <li> Works very well and easy to use</li>
            <li> did not do anything close to what it proclaims to do.  I saw absolutely no change forehead line or crowfeets even after a month.  I contacted the seller to return, THEY DO NOT ALLOW RETURNS they said .which was not spelled out very clearly in their ad. I explained that is a shame to throw $80 down the garbage for a product that does&#x27;t work they had no sympathy of course. Now I see wear some Doctor is tauting the produce on tv for a lot less than what I made. Ladies good luck if choose to ry this.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before and love the effect it has around my eyes! The only thing is that you can not wear make-up over it. I use very little and then don&#x27;t need any eye make-up if you apply it right. A little goes a long way. This is the only product that I have found that does not leave a flaky residue, but don&#x27;t over use it either. I also wish that it didn&#x27;t cost so much!</li>
