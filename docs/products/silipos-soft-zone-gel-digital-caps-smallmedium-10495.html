    <ol>
            <li>Excellent, keeps toes from  callousing</li>
            <li>I tried almost all the brands to see what worked best</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d be thrilled!!</li>
            <li>Works great on my ring toe</li>
            <li>Great product</li>
            <li>It caused great discomfort in walking regardless of the shoe she wore.  </li>
            <li>Have used these before, work good</li>
            <li>Used these before - they do a good job as described.</li>
            <li>They fit perfectly and did not slip at all.</li>
            <li>These looked HUGE in the package however the fit was perfect once on my foot.  </li>
            <li>Very effective, comfortable and unobtrusive.</li>
            <li>Very comfortable.</li>
            <li>I know I will love them.</li>
            <li>There are plenty of better options out there.</li>
            <li>Seems to be working OK.  </li>
            <li>These worked perfectly for my big toes.  </li>
            <li>I love them</li>
            <li>Light a match to your money and warm your fingers instead.</li>
            <li>They do, however, work better when worn with a sock as the sock keeps it in place better.  </li>
            <li>and I love them.  </li>
            <li>Wish they came for all toes :-)</li>
            <li>Using these along with the Hikegoo , the difference from last year to this year is incredible.  </li>
            <li>He is pretty thrilled.  </li>
            <li>but with socks it stays in place just fine.</li>
            <li>Would be good to sell a variety pack to accommodate different size toes.</li>
            <li>We explored several other types and brands, but this one worked best for us.</li>
            <li>I found the caps just right for my foot.</li>
            <li>Perfect for protecting the outside of my little toes...much easier to use than moleskin.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used my digital caps yet because I&#x27;m wearing sandals mostly.  </li>
            <li>Pretty soon I will give them a try.  </li>
            <li>These really help with my toe issues, washable, and reusable!  </li>
            <li>Both pair came apart during first use.  </li>
            <li>Later I put them on 4 more toes because my toenails were getting aggravated, and they helped a lot.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it would work without socks because it tends to be very slippery</li>
            <li>Very comfy</li>
            <li>These are ok, but not really what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>So, for this year&#x27;s Bataan, I bought my own toe caps, enough for every toe if necessary.  </li>
            <li>They were torn apart after five times of moderate walking!!!&lt;br /&gt;The material is very cheap and not tick enough to hold any presure.</li>
            <li>When I stopped later on for more medical help, they had run out of toe caps.  </li>
            <li>I had such good luck with the larger size of these when I lost a big toe nail that I ordered the smaller ones as part of my pianist emergency kit.</li>
            <li>They are very soft and my wife says she doesn&#x27;t even know it&#x27;s on when walking.  </li>
            <li>These turned out to be somewhat too big for my second toes, and were thicker and more bulky than I expected.  </li>
            <li>WELL WORTH THE MONEY I SPENT.  </li>
            <li>These are more expensive than some other brands that look almost the same in pictures, but there is a huge difference in quality.  </li>
            <li>We tried changing shoes and socks which helped some(microfiber absorbent socks definitely help), but these have completely stopped the blisters from forming.  </li>
            <li>can not use all the time as them do not fit right</li>
            <li>The first ones went on my two big toes and one pinkie toe when I stopped at the 12 mile water station due to small blisters that had started to form, which then stayed small and pretty much painless during the rest of the 26.2 miles thanks to the toe caps.  </li>

            <li> I use them over and over and wash them with gentle soap, usually shampoo, and let them dry overnight.</li>
            <li> We were concerned that to correct the issue may require some minor corrective surgery.  </li>
            <li> Wife like them for her long runs.</li>
            <li> Last year when I needed to stop at the medic&#x27;s tent to let them tend to my severely battered feet, they put some of these on my big toes and one little toe.  </li>
            <li> (Caused my actual gait to change while walking, and also caused a couple of other toes to rub together, causing an abrasion between those two</li>
            <li> It ripped in half the second time I used them, however they are comfortable for a toenail that was broken in half.</li>
            <li> One of her toes through the years had turned slightly casing it to compress against the toe next to it.  </li>
            <li> She had tried getting a shoe with a wider box toe, but that only slightly made a difference.  </li>
            <li> The Silipos brand does not deteriorate with time like the lesser expensive brands do which start to deteriorate and turn gummy after a short while.</li>
            <li> I just wish they cost a bit less, as they do split after a bit.</li>
            <li> These little &amp;#34;Rubber Toes&amp;#34; did the trick.  </li>
            <li> I wash the cap after wearing it and then just rub a little petroleum jelly inside and wear it again.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time purchasing these.</li>
            <li> Too bad, I was very hopeful that it would.</li>
            <li> Waste of money!</li>
            <li> I have a bad psoriasis rash that gets on my toes and cracks open and bleeds so these save my toes.  </li>
            <li> I purchased these for my hubby, who found he was always getting painful blisters between his toes after running or playing golf.  </li>
            <li> What was supposed to protect my toes from blisters caused horrible blood blisters and horrific pain.</li>

            <li> They are satisfactory and give some protection.</li>
            <li> Have used these before, work good</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used my digital caps yet because I&#x27;m wearing sandals mostly.  Pretty soon I will give them a try.  I know I will love them.</li>

            <li> Broke after one use. There are plenty of better options out there.</li>
            <li> Seems to be working OK.  Need time to see how well the product holds up to repeated usage.</li>
            <li> Excellent, keeps toes from  callousing</li>
            <li> They were torn apart after five times of moderate walking!!!&lt;br /&gt;The material is very cheap and not tick enough to hold any presure.</li>
            <li> I have a severe hammertoe problem on one to, and this product did not ease the pain.</li>
            <li> It ripped in half the second time I used them, however they are comfortable for a toenail that was broken in half.</li>
            <li> Used these before - they do a good job as described.</li>
            <li> I found the caps just right for my foot. Great product</li>
            <li> These are more expensive than some other brands that look almost the same in pictures, but there is a huge difference in quality.  The Silipos brand does not deteriorate with time like the lesser expensive brands do which start to deteriorate and turn gummy after a short while. These you can wash and use over and over.  I tried almost all the brands to see what worked best and these are it.  I have a bad psoriasis rash that gets on my toes and cracks open and bleeds so these save my toes.  I use them over and over and wash them with gentle soap, usually shampoo, and let them dry overnight.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like it that they come in only one size/package. Would be good to sell a variety pack to accommodate different size toes.</li>
            <li> can not use all the time as them do not fit right</li>
            <li> Perfect for protecting the outside of my little toes...much easier to use than moleskin.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t help relieve bruised toe nails.  Too bad, I was very hopeful that it would.</li>
            <li> These worked perfectly for my big toes.  I walk a lot and my big toe nails both broke and these caps protected them so well.  I love them and I told a lot a people at the gym about them.  They fit perfectly and did not slip at all.</li>
            <li> worked as described.  These really help with my toe issues, washable, and reusable!  I just wish they cost a bit less, as they do split after a bit.</li>
            <li> Both pair came apart during first use.  Light a match to your money and warm your fingers instead.</li>
            <li> I gave this five stars because it provided the relief my wife was looking for.  One of her toes through the years had turned slightly casing it to compress against the toe next to it.  It caused great discomfort in walking regardless of the shoe she wore.  She had tried getting a shoe with a wider box toe, but that only slightly made a difference.  We were concerned that to correct the issue may require some minor corrective surgery.  These little &amp;#34;Rubber Toes&amp;#34; did the trick.  They do, however, work better when worn with a sock as the sock keeps it in place better.  The are washable and re-useable, can be trimmed to use on shorter toes.  They are very soft and my wife says she doesn&#x27;t even know it&#x27;s on when walking.  We explored several other types and brands, but this one worked best for us.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable. I don&#x27;t notice they are on my toes.  I may place an order for another set in case I lose one of them.  They met my expectations.</li>
            <li> I slip one of these over my toe and it has allowed me to walk the golf course without getting a blister on the bottom of the toe.  I wash the cap after wearing it and then just rub a little petroleum jelly inside and wear it again.  I don&#x27;t think it would work without socks because it tends to be very slippery (why it works), but with socks it stays in place just fine.</li>
            <li> I purchased these for my hubby, who found he was always getting painful blisters between his toes after running or playing golf.  We tried changing shoes and socks which helped some(microfiber absorbent socks definitely help), but these have completely stopped the blisters from forming.  He is pretty thrilled.  They work, period.</li>
            <li> Bought these for this year&#x27;s WSMR Bataan March.  Last year when I needed to stop at the medic&#x27;s tent to let them tend to my severely battered feet, they put some of these on my big toes and one little toe.  When I stopped later on for more medical help, they had run out of toe caps.  So, for this year&#x27;s Bataan, I bought my own toe caps, enough for every toe if necessary.  Using these along with the Hikegoo , the difference from last year to this year is incredible.  The first ones went on my two big toes and one pinkie toe when I stopped at the 12 mile water station due to small blisters that had started to form, which then stayed small and pretty much painless during the rest of the 26.2 miles thanks to the toe caps.  Later I put them on 4 more toes because my toenails were getting aggravated, and they helped a lot.  I plan to start the Bataan next year with these already on the toes that needed them this year.  These are a must have for the Bataan!</li>
            <li> I had such good luck with the larger size of these when I lost a big toe nail that I ordered the smaller ones as part of my pianist emergency kit. Very effective, comfortable and unobtrusive.</li>
            <li> Very comfy and I love them.  Wish they came for all toes :-)</li>
            <li> These are ok, but not really what I was looking for.  I was hoping for something I could use on my second toes to help with some blisters I have been getting while running/walking on a treadmill.  These turned out to be somewhat too big for my second toes, and were thicker and more bulky than I expected.  (Caused my actual gait to change while walking, and also caused a couple of other toes to rub together, causing an abrasion between those two toes.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still giving it 4 stars, because it IS as described, and could probably help quite a bit padding an injured toe.  But did want to put a review in here that if you are an athlete looking for a solution to cover up one of your toes, this probably isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li> These looked HUGE in the package however the fit was perfect once on my foot.  Now if I could just get Silipos to make a similar product for bunions I&#x27;d be thrilled!!</li>
            <li> Wife like them for her long runs.</li>
            <li> Waste of money! What was supposed to protect my toes from blisters caused horrible blood blisters and horrific pain. Invested the money in Injinji socks for runners...WELL WORTH THE MONEY I SPENT.  Don&#x27;t waste your time purchasing these.</li>
