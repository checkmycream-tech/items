            <li>Very nice product and great service.  </li>
            <li>very impressed and pleased...</li>
            <li>THIS ITEM WORKS JUST AS GOOD AS THE CHI</li>
            <li>I absolutely loved this when I got it</li>
            <li>I purchased the Croc straightener after having the CHI -- which we also loved.  </li>
            <li>and this does the job just as good as my hair dresser does...saved me money and time....</li>
            <li>Now my search to find a good straightener must resume.....</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with this product, until it broke after just a year.</li>
            <li>so glad I bought it!</li>
            <li>You will love it!</li>
            <li>Better than Chi and lasts a lot longer!</li>
            <li>is MUCH more effective.</li>
            <li>I love this straightener.  </li>
            <li>Best purchase I&#x27;ve ever made on any hair appliance in my entire 45 years!!</li>
            <li>They really love this straightener and say it does magic in 1/2 the time.  </li>
            <li>I thought since I was paying more for the straightener I would be able to use it longer.</li>
            <li>but I love</li>
            <li>My hair is getting many compliments.  </li>
            <li>but I still recommend it because nothing works better.  </li>
            <li>The most amazing and incredible flat iron ...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best flat iron I have used.  </li>
            <li>I would give this flat iron 5 stars because when it did work it was awesome</li>
            <li>Best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever bought!!</li>
            <li>I loved my first 1croc and when that one broke, i had to buy me another.</li>
            <li>Thats pretty good.</li>
            <li>I heard many good things about this item, I have natural hair</li>
            <li>Love the wet feature - works great - better then the Chi model I had before.  </li>
            <li>I knew what I was ordering and it&#x27;s precisely what I received......</li>
            <li>It glides smoothly over hair, won&#x27;t get stuck or snag hair and works well.  </li>
            <li>It is a great flat iron.  </li>
            <li>Although it does an amazing job, it still takes me a while to straighten my hair completely.</li>
            <li>so it quickly pays for itself.  </li>
            <li>I love this Croc flat iron, it&#x27;s far more better than the Chi.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s straight in minutes!!</li>
            <li>I have recommended to clients much, I think the warranty should be longer!!</li>
            <li>Have owned a croc ceramic turboIon in the past and thought it was the best flat iron, but this newer version is even better.  </li>
            <li>It turns out smooth and straight every time, and even holds in humidity.  </li>
            <li>the combo makes my hair look straight and silky smooth.</li>
            <li>and it is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s well worth it for what it does for my hair.</li>
            <li>hair and this iron very quickly and easily smoothed it all out leaving hair very silky and reminding me of how my hair feels when I walk out of a professional salon.  </li>
            <li>They do burn out pretty quickly, but a blow out costs $65</li>
            <li>First one arrived quickly but did not heat up.  </li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and can get the exact temperature I need.  </li>
            <li>I got to say this flat iron by Croc is amazing.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li>and I was a bit weary of buying it because of how hot it gets and the burned hair smell</li>
            <li>I went to a local hardware store and was able to replace the spring.</li>
            <li>I bought it to replace my first, which was ruined after 3 years through no fault of the company.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair so soft, smooth and healthy-looking, even without any hair product.  </li>
            <li>Also, running in and out of my car on hot humid days would start to frizz my hair</li>
            <li>This is the best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever owned...and I am a straightener fanatic.</li>
            <li>I have 3 girls with very curly hair.  </li>
            <li>I have very curly hair</li>
            <li>It also makes getting ready much quicker.  </li>
            <li>Spa she works at, but they were asking to much for it.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommnend this iron for those who want ultra straight and silky hair.</li>
            <li>I can use it on wet or dry hair and it produces such great results, however it seems to work better on dry hair.  </li>
            <li>This flat iron is just as good if not better for a fraction of the price.  </li>
            <li>This straightener makes my hair very soft and cuts my drying time.</li>
            <li>This is my first time using a flat iron and it is easier than I thought it would be.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to keep doing the same section of hair over and over and over trying to achieve the straight results I&#x27;m looking for.  </li>
            <li>the last digit doesn&#x27;t work, this is really 220 degrees).</li>
            <li>I as a professional</li>
            <li>An item that costs around $100 really should last longer than four months&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stay</li>
            <li>You do have to get your hair pretty dry with a blow dryer for it to work</li>
            <li>I had my first one for over 5 years before it died, my second one only lasted 9 months before it died</li>
            <li>It takes half as long to straighten my super curly and frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t flat iron often just 2 times a year to mantain my natural curls.</li>
            <li>I have always used regular inexpensive flat irons, but never any professional styles.</li>
            <li>The iron adds a terrific shine and smoothness to my hair that I never expected, with NO DAMAGE.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> This is the same flat iron my hair dresser used</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd flat iron of this brand</li>
            <li> It heats hot enough to get my frizzy thick hair to straighten and if it&#x27;s damp still it even works well.  </li>
            <li> contact the distributor of Croc Flat Iron, but they could not do anything for passed return period item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, it does not dry my hair when wet.</li>
            <li> I decided I was going to flat iron my hair the other morning only to have an error code 069</li>
            <li> I realize this is a long time to have a straightener, but not for the price I paid.</li>
            <li> After a few months of having it the screen stopped working and only displays the fist 2 numbers, not a big deal because it was only the 0 that stopped working.</li>
            <li> I should have learned after the first two Croc irons I purchased broke within 6 months of use, but now my third one has broken.</li>
            <li> ; hair styling flat iron arrived one day ahead of the expected delivery date.  </li>
            <li> I tried other ones at stores but nothing worked as well on my hair or gave me the same results.  </li>
            <li> We had a Tourmaline t3 before this product that I thought I could never live without.  </li>
            <li> I was afraid this would be too hot and damage my thin, fine hair.</li>
            <li> Go with the 1.5\\&quot; Wet to Dry one.  </li>
            <li> I have had my Turbioion Croc Wet to Dry straightener for just over a year.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s 3 in the last year and a half</li>
            <li> The Turbolon Croc Titanium Wet to Dry 1.5&amp;#34</li>
            <li> and I would highly recommend it because of the way it performs on my dry, very thick, long and wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned at least 4 different flat irons and now wish I had heard about this flat iron sooner.  </li>
            <li> One time, sometimes twice, and my fine thin hair is straightened and like silk!!</li>
            <li> I will again buy a new croc if my second one fails.</li>
            <li> I have extremely curly hair and with this iron</li>
            <li> I got it days before i expected it!</li>
            <li> I read other reviews and have found that this happens often.</li>
            <li> I have to say that while it was working, it was a fantastic straightener, I am just very unhappy with how long it lasted.</li>
            <li> Only negative - return UPS cost $11.</li>
            <li> That being said, a lot of the reviews I read before I bought it said that it cut down styling time dramatically - that has not been my experience.  </li>
            <li> I must admit, the Croc has cut my hair grooming time down by 30 minutes.  </li>
            <li> It cut down my straightening time by almost half than it took with a Chi.</li>
            <li> The only thing I recommend is that your hair be at least somewhat dried before using it.</li>
            <li> a little, well, those days are over.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not unreasonable, give me a partial refund, credit to another item in the store, something!!!  </li>
            <li> but a few weeks ago it stopped working.</li>
            <li> Just a few months after that the spring broke and fell out.</li>
            <li> Just a few days after that happened the screen froze at 22(since</li>
            <li> I was expecting a few years out of it.</li>
            <li> I have long, very thick, wavy/curly hair (esp.</li>
            <li> I finally found this one on Amazon and it was less expensive.  </li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair with a slight wave and even though I am an owner of a Chi hair dryer and straightner, I was so tired of blow drying and then straightening my hair on the days I washed it.  </li>
            <li> IF NOT BETTER IN MY OPINION.</li>
            <li> not sure if i would repurchase this item again.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m giving it 2 because the quality sucks.</li>
            <li> This item is unbelievable!  </li>
            <li> I have quite thick (and at times frizzy!)</li>
            <li> I have extremely thick, wavy, frizzy hair, and this straightener does the trick!  </li>
            <li> this plate is not going that are very weak on cable</li>
            <li> and now I have an expensive but non working piece of equipment.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am sorry for informing this.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I am very unhappy that this straightener worked for just over a year.</li>
            <li> I have not had a bad hair day since!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this straightener.  The only thing I recommend is that your hair be at least somewhat dried before using it.</li>
            <li> It cut down my straightening time by almost half than it took with a Chi. I would never go back to a Chi!</li>
            <li> THIS ITEM WORKS JUST AS GOOD AS THE CHI IF NOT BETTER IN MY OPINION. THE DESIGN MAKES FOR AN EASIER GRIP, WHICH I LIKE AS WELL.</li>
            <li> We had a Tourmaline t3 before this product that I thought I could never live without.  I had paid over $200 dollars for it 8 years ago.  This flat iron is just as good if not better for a fraction of the price.  I highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> This is the same flat iron my hair dresser used and I was a bit weary of buying it because of how hot it gets and the burned hair smell I sometimes get when she uses it but I have found that at a lower temp it still does wonders for my hair so glad I bought it!</li>
            <li> This item is unbelievable!  I was afraid this would be too hot and damage my thin, fine hair. Quite the contrary!  I don&#x27;t have to keep doing the same section of hair over and over and over trying to achieve the straight results I&#x27;m looking for.  One time, sometimes twice, and my fine thin hair is straightened and like silk!! The iron adds a terrific shine and smoothness to my hair that I never expected, with NO DAMAGE.  I&#x27;ve gotten a ton of compliments after using this.  Best purchase I&#x27;ve ever made on any hair appliance in my entire 45 years!!</li>
            <li> Best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever bought!! I have extremely curly hair and with this iron it&#x27;s straight in minutes!! And it heats up instantly.. Best hair product purchase ever!!</li>
            <li> I have long, very thick, wavy/curly hair (esp. when it is humid out) and this iron does wonders for straightening it.  That being said, a lot of the reviews I read before I bought it said that it cut down styling time dramatically - that has not been my experience.  Although it does an amazing job, it still takes me a while to straighten my hair completely.</li>
            <li> I knew what I was ordering and it&#x27;s precisely what I received......oh wait! I got it days before i expected it!</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved this when I got it but a few weeks ago it stopped working. It got stuck on 69, then displayed \\&quot;err\\&quot; and then turned itself off. I googled it to see if there was a fix and found 100&#x27;s of people had the same issue. I have emailed the manufacturer but still no response. I suspect this is a design fault and now I have an expensive but non working piece of equipment.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best flat iron I have used.  It takes half as long to straighten my super curly and frizzy hair.  It was recommended to me and used by my hair stylist at Vidal Sassoon and works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Croc straightener after having the CHI -- which we also loved.  I have 3 girls with very curly hair.  They really love this straightener and say it does magic in 1/2 the time.  They do burn out pretty quickly, but a blow out costs $65 so it quickly pays for itself.  I would recommend buying this straightener.  Go with the 1.5\\&quot; Wet to Dry one.  You will love it!</li>
            <li> This is a Christmas present and so we don&#x27;t know yet how well the product works. We got this within a very good timeline.</li>
            <li> Have owned a croc ceramic turboIon in the past and thought it was the best flat iron, but this newer version is even better.  I have quite thick (and at times frizzy!) hair and this iron very quickly and easily smoothed it all out leaving hair very silky and reminding me of how my hair feels when I walk out of a professional salon.  LOVE it!!!  Highly recommnend this iron for those who want ultra straight and silky hair.</li>
            <li> I have had my Turbioion Croc Wet to Dry straightener for just over a year. I realize this is a long time to have a straightener, but not for the price I paid. After a few months of having it the screen stopped working and only displays the fist 2 numbers, not a big deal because it was only the 0 that stopped working. Just a few months after that the spring broke and fell out. I went to a local hardware store and was able to replace the spring. Just a few days after that happened the screen froze at 22(since the last digit doesn&#x27;t work, this is really 220 degrees). I am very unhappy that this straightener worked for just over a year. I thought since I was paying more for the straightener I would be able to use it longer. I have $20 straighteners that have lasted longer than this.  I have to say that while it was working, it was a fantastic straightener, I am just very unhappy with how long it lasted. I was expecting a few years out of it.</li>
            <li> This is the best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever owned...and I am a straightener fanatic. Better than Chi and lasts a lot longer! Must buy...if you are on the fence.</li>
            <li> The most amazing and incredible flat iron ... I have very curly hair and this does the job just as good as my hair dresser does...saved me money and time....very impressed and pleased...Thank you!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is my second Croc wet-to-dry.  I bought it to replace my first, which was ruined after 3 years through no fault of the company.  I have extremely thick, wavy, frizzy hair, and this straightener does the trick!  It turns out smooth and straight every time, and even holds in humidity.  I have gone through 3 Chis and the Croc is MUCH more effective.</li>
            <li> This straightener makes my hair very soft and cuts my drying time. However, it does not dry my hair when wet. You do have to get your hair pretty dry with a blow dryer for it to work but I still like this product a lot and it is well worth the money. It polishes your look.</li>
            <li> I love this Croc flat iron, it&#x27;s far more better than the Chi.  It makes my hair so soft, smooth and healthy-looking, even without any hair product.  I can use it on wet or dry hair and it produces such great results, however it seems to work better on dry hair.  It also makes getting ready much quicker.  I&#x27;ve owned at least 4 different flat irons and now wish I had heard about this flat iron sooner.  I highly recommend this product and won&#x27;t ever settle for anything less.</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my daughter in law at her request for birthday.  First one arrived quickly but did not heat up.  Vendor sent 2nd one before they received 1st one back.  2nd one works great, per birthday girl.  Excellent service, good product.  Only negative - return UPS cost $11.</li>
            <li> I should have learned after the first two Croc irons I purchased broke within 6 months of use, but now my third one has broken. That&#x27;s 3 in the last year and a half and the manufacturer refused to do anything about it. I do not recommend purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> I as a professional but I love this plate is not going that are very weak on cable this is my third unit! I have recommended to clients much, I think the warranty should be longer!!</li>
            <li> It is a great flat iron.  It heats up quickly and can get the exact temperature I need.  I would recommend this to othe customers</li>
            <li> I have always used regular inexpensive flat irons, but never any professional styles. I got to say this flat iron by Croc is amazing. My hair straightens beautifully with the wet-to-dry feature  when my hairs is still damp. Along with the digital tempurature settings up to 450*F are the (-)Negitive Ions it puts off and the combo makes my hair look straight and silky smooth. Just like being at the salon!</li>
            <li> I purchased this item back in 2011 I heard many good things about this item, I have natural hair so I don&#x27;t flat iron often just 2 times a year to mantain my natural curls. So from the time I brought this to now I have used this item a total of 5 times. I decided I was going to flat iron my hair the other morning only to have an error code 069 and the iron shut off. I read other reviews and have found that this happens often. I would give this flat iron 5 stars because when it did work it was awesome but I&#x27;m giving it 2 because the quality sucks. not sure if i would repurchase this item again.</li>
            <li> Love the wet feature - works great - better then the Chi model I had before.  Great price as well.</li>
            <li> The Turbolon Croc Titanium Wet to Dry 1.5&amp;#34; hair styling flat iron arrived one day ahead of the expected delivery date.  It works great.  This is my first time using a flat iron and it is easier than I thought it would be.  My hair is getting many compliments.  Very nice product and great service.  Thank you</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this product, until it broke after just a year. The heating element stopped working. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is my second croc. I loved my first 1croc and when that one broke, i had to buy me another. I will again buy a new croc if my second one fails. My croc&#x27;s last me 2yrs. Thats pretty good.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair with a slight wave and even though I am an owner of a Chi hair dryer and straightner, I was so tired of blow drying and then straightening my hair on the days I washed it.  My hairdresser tried getting me to buy the Turbo Ion Croc at the Day Spa she works at, but they were asking to much for it.  I finally found this one on Amazon and it was less expensive.  I must admit, the Croc has cut my hair grooming time down by 30 minutes.  Also, running in and out of my car on hot humid days would start to frizz my hair a little, well, those days are over.  I have not had a bad hair day since!</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd flat iron of this brand and I would highly recommend it because of the way it performs on my dry, very thick, long and wavy hair.  It heats hot enough to get my frizzy thick hair to straighten and if it&#x27;s damp still it even works well.  When they broke on me I tried other ones at stores but nothing worked as well on my hair or gave me the same results.  It glides smoothly over hair, won&#x27;t get stuck or snag hair and works well.  I had my first one for over 5 years before it died, my second one only lasted 9 months before it died but I still recommend it because nothing works better.  Be prepared it might suddenly die out on you but it&#x27;s well worth it for what it does for my hair.</li>
            <li> My wife purchased this item in March 2012.  My daughter and wife have used this straightener one to three times per week since purchased.  As of yesterday it is no longer working, it won&#x27;t even turn on.  So I contacted the seller Fashion Hub and was provided with the following reply:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sorry for informing this.&lt;br /&gt;This order has passed 30 day return period.&lt;br /&gt;I contact the distributor of Croc Flat Iron, but they could not do anything for passed return period item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really???  So you&#x27;re telling me that a company only guarantees their item will last for 30 days?  After that your out of luck!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not unreasonable, give me a partial refund, credit to another item in the store, something!!!  An item that costs around $100 really should last longer than four months&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stay away from this straightener and move on to find something else!!!!  Now my search to find a good straightener must resume.....</li>
