            <li>My favorite Lotion.</li>
            <li>Love the scent.  </li>
            <li>but this one is light, comfortable and smells lovely.</li>
            <li>Lightweight; absorbs easily.</li>
            <li>Love the sweet scent.</li>
            <li>The scent is light and there is no greasy effect when using.</li>
            <li>Avojuice is great as a temporary fix for dry hands.</li>
            <li>It goes on quickly, water bases, never oily.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was fast :) I&#x27;m generally really picky with my lotion scents and get headaches when I&#x27;m in places like Bath and Body Works, and this scent was too strong for me.</li>
            <li>I live in Florida and most moisturizers are too greasy for the climate</li>
            <li>When you first apply it, it seems a bit oily, but within seconds, it starts sinking into your skin, and within 15 seconds has completely absorbed, leaving no greasy residue.  </li>
            <li>coworkers have complimented me numerous times daily about how good they think that I smell.</li>
            <li>I am 70 yrs old, and my skin is very soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Very mango-y.</li>

            <li>Makes my hands feel very soft.</li>
            <li>very soft and stays on even after washing hands...</li>
            <li>The only lotion I consistently keep buying.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a couple different scents and the mango is one of my favorites; it&#x27;s a light fruity scent, not very overpowering.</li>
            <li>Makes my hands soft without a greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>If you need an intense, deep hand lotion this lotion is not for you.  </li>
            <li>Smell is a bit overpowering, but it&#x27;s a good scent (very fruity, artificial).</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Love this lotion. Mango scent is delicious!</li>
            <li> I had received this as a gift and when it was getting low tried to find it locally, to no avail.  I was quite happy to find it on Amazon and be able to continue to use a wonderful product.  The scent is light and there is no greasy effect when using.</li>
            <li> Very mango-y. But very good lotion!</li>
            <li> Smells great but doesn&#x27;t moisturize that well.</li>
            <li> silky-ist lotion i have found.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. Makes my hands soft without a greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> Smells incredible and softens hands really nice. Makes a great lotion for your kitchen sink tip or at your desk.</li>
            <li> Makes my hands feel very soft. Smells awesome.</li>
            <li> We were introduced to this product at a salon and my mother never forgot about it.  She looked all over for it and I finally ordered it for her off of Amazon.  She loves it!  Silky hands with a nice mango scent!</li>
            <li> Avo Juice is my favorite lotion. It goes on quickly, water bases, never oily.  Skin feels silky when done applying. The only lotion I consistently keep buying.</li>
            <li> I love the OPI Avojuice Skin Quenchers line of lotion.  It&#x27;s a very light, almost watery lotion that keeps my hands lightly hydrated and smelling good.  If you need an intense, deep hand lotion this lotion is not for you.

            <li> I got a sample of this lotion as part of a gift swap, and I figured it would be another greasy mess that would end up in my junk drawer.  I&#x27;m so glad I gave it a chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lotion smells heavenly!  When you first apply it, it seems a bit oily, but within seconds, it starts sinking into your skin, and within 15 seconds has completely absorbed, leaving no greasy residue.  This is my new go to lotion!</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast :) I&#x27;m generally really picky with my lotion scents and get headaches when I&#x27;m in places like Bath and Body Works, and this scent was too strong for me. I use it before I go to bed and wake up with dry hands like usual. Avojuice is great as a temporary fix for dry hands. If you want moisture retained in your skin, either use something else or use something in conjunction with this.</li>
            <li> I live in Florida and most moisturizers are too greasy for the climate but this one is light, comfortable and smells lovely.</li>
            <li> This is a gift for a friend who absolutely loves this stuff.</li>
            <li> Light smell and works great. Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Great hand lotion. Love the sweet scent.</li>
            <li> My favorite Lotion. This one is a gift and it arrived 3 days after I bought it!!!!!! I will order again</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter-in-law, who loves it.</li>
            <li> The skin quenchers are great. Would recommend .</li>
            <li> Wonderful,tropical scent!</li>
            <li> Love the scent.  Will recommend it to all my friends.  I was given a sample of this product&lt;br /&gt;from my beutician.</li>
            <li> excellent product. smooth on and smell pleasant. coworkers have complimented me numerous times daily about how good they think that I smell. I have been recommending your product to coworkers and family/friends.</li>
            <li> I received a sample and loved it.  Ingredient list includes dimethicone, which as a wound &amp; skin care specialist RN I learned is key in smoothing skin.  This is the second bottle I&#x27;ve ordered since February, as I use it daily on hands, elbows &amp; arms, and all over after showering.  I am 70 yrs old, and my skin is very soft and smooth.  I highly recommend OPI Ajojuice lotions.  The mango is my favorite fragrance, though the coconut and the vanilla are also very nice.  I don&#x27;t care so much for the florals.</li>
            <li> Lightweight; absorbs easily. Smell is a bit overpowering, but it&#x27;s a good scent (very fruity, artificial).</li>
            <li> A wonderful fresh smell, excellent moisturizer for a reasonable price. I recommend it highly.</li>
