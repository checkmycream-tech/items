    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Very good hairspray!</li>
            <li>This hairspray smells amazing!!</li>
            <li>Very pleased!</li>
            <li>great size for a great price.</li>
            <li>Good product, excellent for fine hair.  </li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>Love this hair spray!  </li>
            <li>This is a very light, flexible hair spay with a light scent but still a good hold.</li>
            <li>But if you have fine hair, this is for you!</li>
            <li>Love pantene products.</li>
            <li>The biggest plus is my head does not Itch with this spray like so many of them do.  </li>
            <li>So glad I read the reviews on it</li>
            <li>My most favorite hairspray ever...smells great, no sticky residue and no stiff hair.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and need a spray to keep my hair in some control.  </li>
            <li>The one in use seems fine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s huge....</li>
            <li>For a cheap hair spray, it does it&#x27;s job</li>
            <li>Probably works great for someone with thinner hair, but I have a lot of hair and need a little more boost.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a light spray with hold but not a helmet head feeling, and hopefully no itchy scalp for you, a good quantity (tall can of spray), a fair price, and the other big plus is you can comb or brush through your hair at the end of the day.....</li>
            <li>Exactly like the original  flex hold hair spray that is discontinued.</li>
            <li>I have found that my hair holds up in most weather after using this spray, except when it is really windy or very rainy.  </li>
            <li>definitely worth the price</li>
            <li>I use it daily &amp; highly recommend:)</li>
            <li>Also, I cannot find this spray at other stores, so I had to purchase more cans in case</li>
            <li>Not horrible but a bit too stiff</li>
            <li>, the cans are huge and will last for a long time.  </li>
            <li>This is a level 1, which I bought for those days where my hair doesn&#x27;t need much, but the level 1 is almost TOO low.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t hold nearly as well as Tresemme.</li>
            <li>I wonder if it smells because it&#x27;s old.  </li>
            <li>If you use a ton of hairspray daily and don&#x27;t wash your hair on a daily basis, this is probably not the right product for you.</li>
            <li>Very much what I expected</li>
            <li>Holds my extra fine hair without being hard or sticky.</li>
            <li>It also flakes less then other cheap hairsprays (I&#x27;m looking at you Garnier).</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Have been using it for years and have a hard time finding it in the stores consistently.</li>
            <li> This seems to do a decent job and, like the Dove, does not make the hair sticky or stiff.  </li>
            <li> It is not easy to find, I looked in  many of the big box and chain drug stores but cold not find the #1 flexible hold.  </li>
            <li> There was actually dust on the caps and one can is slightly dented when I received them.  </li>
            <li> By the second day of using this stuff, I can start to see a little bit of flaking creeping in.</li>
            <li> and so I paid around $2.00 and some change, which you could never get at a Walmart or other store.  </li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> It smells a bit unpleasant when it comes out of the can, but the smell seems to dissipate quickly.  </li>
            <li> Not fantastic</li>
            <li> This is a winner.. leaves no sticky or stiff residue..</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s too hard to find or too expensive.  </li>

            <li> This is a level 1, which I bought for those days where my hair doesn&#x27;t need much, but the level 1 is almost TOO low. Probably works great for someone with thinner hair, but I have a lot of hair and need a little more boost. So, level 2 for me next time. But if you have fine hair, this is for you!</li>
            <li> great size for a great price. Love pantene products.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold nearly as well as Tresemme. Would NOT purchase again.</li>
            <li> Not horrible but a bit too stiff</li>
            <li> Works as advertised--flexible hold lasts all day. For a cheap hair spray, it does it&#x27;s job well. It also flakes less then other cheap hairsprays (I&#x27;m looking at you Garnier). HOWEVER, I only wash my hair every 3 days. By the second day of using this stuff, I can start to see a little bit of flaking creeping in. If you use a ton of hairspray daily and don&#x27;t wash your hair on a daily basis, this is probably not the right product for you.</li>
            <li> This is a winner.. leaves no sticky or stiff residue.. Exactly like the original  flex hold hair spray that is discontinued.</li>
            <li> I like the Pantene Pro-V Styler Flexible Hold Hairspray because it does not feel like a helmet on my head.  I have found that my hair holds up in most weather after using this spray, except when it is really windy or very rainy.  The biggest plus is my head does not Itch with this spray like so many of them do.  I have fine hair and need a spray to keep my hair in some control.  I have purchased three cans of this because I don&#x27;t want to be without.  Amazon had coupons that took off two dollars and so I paid around $2.00 and some change, which you could never get at a Walmart or other store.  Also, I cannot find this spray at other stores, so I had to purchase more cans in case Amazon stops carrying the product...which I hope does not happen.  If you are looking for a light spray with hold but not a helmet head feeling, and hopefully no itchy scalp for you, a good quantity (tall can of spray), a fair price, and the other big plus is you can comb or brush through your hair at the end of the day.....you may want to try out this product.</li>
            <li> This hairspray smells amazing!! It gives a \\&quot;moveable hold\\&quot; I like that my hair does not turn to brick when I spray this on. I use it daily &amp; highly recommend:)</li>
            <li> I use this hairspray to spray on my bangs in the morning so that they wil hold their shape throughout the day. It works well. Not fantastic but it is what I expect from a flexible hold hairspray.</li>
            <li> Very much what I expected</li>
            <li> Love this product! Have been using it for years and have a hard time finding it in the stores consistently. Flexible hold leaves my hair touchable, yet holds the curls. Hope they never change the formulation of the flexible hold!</li>
            <li> This is a very light, flexible hair spay with a light scent but still a good hold.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s huge....definitely worth the price</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and as advertised.</li>
            <li> Love this hair spray!  It helps give me volume where I want it and holds my hair but is flexible also!  So glad I read the reviews on it or I would not have known about it!  Thank you reviewers!  I definitely will keep using this one!</li>
            <li> I used to use Dove but it&#x27;s too hard to find or too expensive.  This seems to do a decent job and, like the Dove, does not make the hair sticky or stiff.  It smells a bit unpleasant when it comes out of the can, but the smell seems to dissipate quickly.  I wonder if it smells because it&#x27;s old.  There was actually dust on the caps and one can is slightly dented when I received them.  Other than that, the cans are huge and will last for a long time.  Definitely a bargain.</li>
            <li> Good product, excellent for fine hair.  It is not easy to find, I looked in  many of the big box and chain drug stores but cold not find the #1 flexible hold.  If you like this product, stock up when you see it.</li>
            <li> The one in use seems fine.</li>
            <li> My most favorite hairspray ever...smells great, no sticky residue and no stiff hair. Will definitely buy this again!</li>
            <li> Very good hairspray! Holds my extra fine hair without being hard or sticky. Very pleased!</li>
