            <li>I thought this was a great price for this size bottle, and, again, it would be if the scent lasted at all.</li>

            <li>I was so happy when i found my favorite perfume which stopped produced.</li>
            <li>I love this perfume!</li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>It is kind of tropical, like fruity and flowery.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I think it&#x27;s a really nice, girly, summer fragrance, and I would recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li>They always come out with great new scents, but this one is simply sweet and delicious.</li>
            <li>amazon.com had the best price for a 3.4 oz brand new in a tester box....53.00.</li>
            <li>I love the perfume and it&#x27;s an amazing deal at this price</li>
            <li>It is a sweet, fresh, tropical scent that I thought would be perfect for the summer.</li>
            <li>Tai Sunset was apparently one of Escada&#x27;s summer fragrances, it is wonderful!  </li>
            <li>I smelled Taj Sunset at a store and fell in love.</li>
            <li>I have gotten so many compliments on it. :-)</li>
            <li>I recently ordered the Taj Sunset perfume and I am impressed with it.  </li>
            <li>I love this fragrance.</li>
            <li>After wearing any fragrance for a couple hours we tend to not be able to smell it on ourselves so check with someone you&#x27;re close to.</li>
            <li>I shopped around looking for this product and amazon was definitely the cheapest best deal.</li>
            <li>I have used this perfume for more than 3 years.</li>
            <li>I LOVE LOVE Taj Sunset</li>
            <li>:) it&#x27;s my Fav by far!&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li>If you like mango, you&#x27;ll love this.</li>
            <li>I would say that it is closest to Rockin&#x27; Rio, but more...</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this fragrance.</li>
            <li>I love this fragrance.</li>
            <li>but it is authentic and the price is better</li>
            <li>I love the scent of this perfume, but noticed it wore off very quickly.</li>
            <li>Its fresh, citrus sweet fragrance is easy to wear - nicely done Escada!</li>
            <li>When i first purchsed this perfume in sephora it smells amazing n stayed for hrs</li>
            <li>(I have owned/tried Moon Sparkle, Rockin&#x27; Rio, Sexy Graffitti and Born in Paradise), because it&#x27;s sweet, but not headache-inducing</li>
            <li>I have been a loyal Escada fragrance user for many years.  </li>
            <li>How a fragrance performs depends a great deal on individual body chemistry.</li>
            <li>Light &amp; sweet smelling.</li>
            <li>i was excited to get it</li>
            <li>so over all defiantly good transaction and would buy from again in the future..</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think the scent lasts too long, but it is really pleasant.</li>
            <li>The first time I put it on, I got a compliment within 20 minutes!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very picky when it comes to fragrances but this smells absolutely fantastic.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There isn&#x27;t much development in the scent, meaning I don&#x27;t really smell any of the more floral/woody/musky scents, even hours into wearing the perfume.</li>
            <li>I was excited to finally get a bottle of my favorite perfume since I had run out.</li>
            <li>the scent just hits all the right notes.</li>
            <li>this one has got the right beachy vibe for sunny Los Angeles.</li>
            <li>It was the middle of summer on a beautiful Southern Californian afternoon and</li>
            <li>I first seen this product at kohls.</li>
            <li>This is my personal favorite of the Escada summer fragrances at the moment</li>
            <li>i dont remember exact anount , but i think it was 47,then when they tax  on</li>
            <li>My Fiancee absolutely loves this perfume!</li>
            <li>it was priced fairly and mailed within a few days of placing the order.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true, that like most of the other Escada LEs that the scent does not last throughout the day, so you have to spray it once, maybe twice more.</li>
            <li>Many reviewers on other sites are saying that it fades quickly.  </li>
            <li>I purchased it at Ulta, large and travel size.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t matter how much you put on or where you put it on your body.</li>
            <li>I recommend the whole escada line</li>
            <li>Then i turned to amazon, where i found this reasonably priced perfume.</li>
            <li>So i made my order, shipping was reasonable</li>
            <li>It has a blend of fresh fruit with a soft fragrance.</li>
            <li>and I will purchase this again and the price reasonable</li>
            <li>is real escada product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Edited to add that the bottle arrived with a crack in a plastic piece at the top and the \\&quot;sprayer\\&quot; never worked properly due to this.</li>
            <li>The initial scent is lovely, but within ten minutes it is gone.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend buying this yummy smelling perfume.</li>
            <li>I fell in love with the smell and look of this perfume, but didn&#x27;t want to pay a lot for a little amount.</li>
            <li>I love the smell but it does not last very long.</li>
            <li>Hopefully you don&#x27;t want that, and in that case, steer clear of this perfume!</li>
            <li>(I am not a gourmand person), and the mango note is the strongest note by far.</li>
            <li>but its smell really different, fade away in 1,2 mins, the spray button doesnt work very well.</li>
            <li>i love  this  perfume, its hard to find in my local stores.</li>
            <li>There is barely a fragrance from which to fade.  </li>
            <li>I am in my forties and don&#x27;t usually wear sweet</li>
            <li>If you want to smell like a sweet, sticky, tropical alcoholic drink, then this fragrance is for you.</li>
            <li>I started using Escada back in 96 and every year Escada comes out with a new fragrance and NEVER has the same scent.</li>

            <li> Looking forward to trying other scents by Escada!</li>
            <li> Neither I, or anyone else could smell it after less than an hour after applying it.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product for about $25 less than I saw it at sephora</li>
            <li> lady?\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;The perfume is not particularly strong, I had just applied it before driving to the store.</li>
            <li> I usually buy perfume in Sephora, I was a little nervous buying it</li>
            <li> For the past few years, they have missed the boat!  </li>
            <li> What a waste of money!</li>
            <li> This is a weak body spray.  </li>
            <li> Poor shipping packaging.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes, but I am so disappointed!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really unfortunate because, like I said, this is basically my dream summer scent.</li>
            <li> Thats just sad</li>
            <li> Really unfortunate!</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed once it arrived</li>

            <li> I have been a loyal Escada fragrance user for many years.  I have always looked forward to their seasonal fragrances.  For the past few years, they have missed the boat!  Taj Sunset is no exception!  SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!  This is a weak body spray.  Many reviewers on other sites are saying that it fades quickly.  There is barely a fragrance from which to fade.  It starts as a strong smell of alcohol and dissipates to practically nothing!!!  I had high hopes, but I am so disappointed!!!</li>
            <li> I smelled Taj Sunset at a store and fell in love. It is a sweet, fresh, tropical scent that I thought would be perfect for the summer. And it would be! If the scent lasted longer than 10 minutes on my skin. It doesn&#x27;t matter how much you put on or where you put it on your body. It&#x27;s gone in 10-15 minutes. It&#x27;s really unfortunate because, like I said, this is basically my dream summer scent. I thought this was a great price for this size bottle, and, again, it would be if the scent lasted at all. Really unfortunate! I do not recommend spending the money on this perfume.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best smelling Escadas I&#x27;ve smelled in a while. They always come out with great new scents, but this one is simply sweet and delicious. A coworker the other day exclaimed, \\&quot;You smell good!\\&quot; as she passed by me in the office. It&#x27;s true, that like most of the other Escada LEs that the scent does not last throughout the day, so you have to spray it once, maybe twice more. I just carry the bottle with me &amp; refresh in the bathroom or on a break. I find that spraying it on my clothes and hair help the scent to last longer. That is why I purchased the 3.3oz, because I spray about 6-8 times each time I use it. The price for this size bottle is great, though. I can&#x27;t find it cheaper anywhere else.</li>
            <li> I wore it too the supermarket and a man approached me and said \\&quot;I hope you don&#x27;t think I am being too forward I just want to say you smell amazing! You walked by and I asked myself was that scent from that lady?\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;The perfume is not particularly strong, I had just applied it before driving to the store. It was the middle of summer on a beautiful Southern Californian afternoon and the scent just hits all the right notes. I like the fact it has a hint of coconut. I think its a youthful fragrance but not over powering -  I am in my forties and don&#x27;t usually wear sweet fragrance- this one has got the right beachy vibe for sunny Los Angeles.</li>
            <li> The initial scent is lovely, but within ten minutes it is gone.  Since I don&#x27;t plan to spritz myself all day long, I have to wear another perfume.  Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume! It has a great fruity smell that everyone loves even those who dislike perfumes. I recommend the whole escada line</li>
            <li> I love the scent of this perfume, but noticed it wore off very quickly. Neither I, or anyone else could smell it after less than an hour after applying it.  I&#x27;ve never returned a perfume before, but I am going to try with this one. What a waste of money!</li>
            <li> If you want to smell like a sweet, sticky, tropical alcoholic drink, then this fragrance is for you. Hopefully you don&#x27;t want that, and in that case, steer clear of this perfume!</li>
            <li> I bought this product for about $25 less than I saw it at sephora and I love it! I have gotten so many compliments on it. :-)</li>
            <li> I first seen this product at kohls. I fell in love with the smell and look of this perfume, but didn&#x27;t want to pay a lot for a little amount. Then i turned to amazon, where i found this reasonably priced perfume. So i made my order, shipping was reasonable did take long to get product. plus, it wasn&#x27;t damaged when i received it. so over all defiantly good transaction and would buy from again in the future..</li>
            <li> Tai Sunset was apparently one of Escada&#x27;s summer fragrances, it is wonderful!  I purchased it at Ulta, large and travel size. When I used both of them, I went back for more and there was no more to be found!!!!!  Amazon was an excellent source for me---- it was priced fairly and mailed within a few days of placing the order. I&#x27;m very pleased!</li>
            <li> This perfume smells amazing! I will definitely wear this year round. Looking forward to trying other scents by Escada! Light &amp; sweet smelling.</li>
            <li> I recently ordered the Taj Sunset perfume and I am impressed with it.  It is a legitimate product.  I highly recommend buying this yummy smelling perfume. Its a great springtime perfume!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very picky when it comes to fragrances but this smells absolutely fantastic. Will definitely purchase another bottle once finished.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance. It smells wonderful and lasts all day. My boyfriend can attest to that.  After wearing any fragrance for a couple hours we tend to not be able to smell it on ourselves so check with someone you&#x27;re close to. On behalf of those working/living with you please don&#x27;t keep applying any scent just because you can&#x27;t smell it any longer.  How a fragrance performs depends a great deal on individual body chemistry. When it goes on and instantly smells like alcohol or bug spray or starts giving you an instant headache -it&#x27;s just not compatible with your body chemistry.</li>
            <li> This perfume smells amazing! It is kind of tropical, like fruity and flowery.  I shopped around looking for this product and amazon was definitely the cheapest best deal.</li>
            <li> I have used this perfume for more than 3 years. I LOVE ESCADA!!!!!! I started using Escada back in 96 and every year Escada comes out with a new fragrance and NEVER has the same scent. It&#x27;s seasonal. I always get compliments from men and women that i smell fruity and delish,lol. I LOVE LOVE Taj Sunset :) it&#x27;s my Fav by far!&lt;br /&gt;Once you try it no need to go back to any other brand.</li>
            <li> I purchased this at my local Perfumania, and below is my review from fragrantica.com:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a tropical, mango-ey, beach-side-fruity-cocktail drink perfume through and through. This is my personal favorite of the Escada summer fragrances at the moment (I have owned/tried Moon Sparkle, Rockin&#x27; Rio, Sexy Graffitti and Born in Paradise), because it&#x27;s sweet, but not headache-inducing (I am not a gourmand person), and the mango note is the strongest note by far. If you like mango, you&#x27;ll love this. I would say that it is closest to Rockin&#x27; Rio, but more...mango-ey lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There isn&#x27;t much development in the scent, meaning I don&#x27;t really smell any of the more floral/woody/musky scents, even hours into wearing the perfume. The lasting power is decent, but not incredible; I can spray this around 5PM and still smell it only myself when I sniff my wrists at 10PM as long as I&#x27;m not doing too much and running around all night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think it&#x27;s a really nice, girly, summer fragrance, and I would recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this fragrance. Definitely a \\&quot;fruity\\&quot; scent. Not as sticky-sweet as something I wore as a teen. Clean.&lt;br /&gt;Edited to add that the bottle arrived with a crack in a plastic piece at the top and the \\&quot;sprayer\\&quot; never worked properly due to this. Poor shipping packaging.</li>
            <li> The first time I put it on, I got a compliment within 20 minutes!  I don&#x27;t think the scent lasts too long, but it is really pleasant.</li>
            <li> I love the smell but it does not last very long. Smells fruity and reminds me of mango and fruity stuff.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance. It has a blend of fresh fruit with a soft fragrance. I get complitments every time I wear it. Just wish it was easier to find.</li>
            <li> I was excited to finally get a bottle of my favorite perfume since I had run out. I was very disappointed once it arrived and I sprayed it. It smells like fruity rubbing alcohol. I will not purchase from this seller again!</li>
            <li> I usually buy perfume in Sephora, I was a little nervous buying it online but it is authentic and the price is better</li>
            <li> I love the perfume and it&#x27;s an amazing deal at this price</li>
            <li> I love it!!! This smells so good and I will purchase this again and the price reasonable and I recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> amazon.com had the best price for a 3.4 oz brand new in a tester box....53.00. i dont remember exact anount , but i think it was 47,then when they tax  on i paid 53 and change.  i love  this  perfume, its hard to find in my local stores. so i am very happy to save time and money, oh and the shipping was great.. i never sent my opinion, but i will always shop with them too.</li>
            <li> My Fiancee absolutely loves this perfume! I went to every store in my area and no one carries this item. Thank goodness for Amazon!</li>
            <li> Love this perfume - the scent is amazing!!  Its fresh, citrus sweet fragrance is easy to wear - nicely done Escada!</li>
            <li> I was so happy when i found my favorite perfume which stopped produced. It costs 150 n i was excited to get it but its smell really different, fade away in 1,2 mins, the spray button doesnt work very well. When i first purchsed this perfume in sephora it smells amazing n stayed for hrs so i doubt wat i just bought here is real escada product. Thats just sad</li>
