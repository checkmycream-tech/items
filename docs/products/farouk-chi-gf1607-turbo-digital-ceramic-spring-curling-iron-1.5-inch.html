    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I am very happy with this curly iron.</li>
            <li>They do THE best job.</li>
            <li>The 1 1/2 size is great for creating perfect waves.</li>
            <li>Ive had this curling iron for about a year and loved it!</li>
            <li>but it has done a great job...</li>
            <li>it was a great product but when i moved i have no idea what happened to it</li>
            <li>I love it !!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t fry hair, but gives it a VERY nice shine.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a shame because I really loved it.</li>
            <li>hope people realize that they have a product that is good for about 13-18 months</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love and recommend it!</li>
            <li>so you are on your own to figure it out.  </li>
            <li>Heats up very quickly, leaves beautiful curls and was easy to use.</li>
            <li>This is the best curling iron I&#x27;ve gotten so far.</li>
            <li>it is I have very fine hair</li>
            <li>I just purchased a hot tools curling iron based on the great reviews on here.</li>
            <li>My hair does not curl easily, but I wanted to give this a try for my beach wedding since I was doing my own hair.  </li>
            <li>I could give a better review.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t encountered any problems with heat damage to my hair, either, although I do not curl my hair more than twice weekly.  </li>
            <li>This iron may in fact be better for someone with longer hair.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this curling iron.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll gladly change my review to 5 stars if the life span is longer on this one.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what the life span of an Iron is, but I would think more than 10 months??</li>
            <li>because I had it on the highest setting most of the time</li>
            <li>I love this curling iron.  </li>
            <li>then the clip breaks and you can&#x27;t use it any more.</li>
            <li>I ended up taking my original to the office and keeping this one at home!  </li>
            <li>When it did work she absolutely loved it and now wants another one.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was willing to spend a bit more on a curling iron for a better quality experience.  </li>
            <li>I am by no means a hairstyling guru, but this product is easy and comfortable to use.  </li>
            <li>read on-line that for most curling irons, the clip is the first thing to go and you can buy that part and fix it yourself, for most irons...</li>
            <li>On top of that, why would I want to spend so much money for what should be a cheap and easy fix, and why didn&#x27;t customer service seem concerned about this?</li>
            <li>It was a good purchase, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>Overall a good product.</li>
            <li>I liked the first one so much that I quickly bought one for home and one for gym, one for another gym</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and doesn&#x27;t burn my hair.</li>
            <li>This ceramic curling iron is by far one of the best I&#x27;ve ever used, heats up fast and doesn&#x27;t damage my hair, I would definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li>I think it gives a nice effect of big waves and curls.</li>
            <li>This one is even better than the original (red) one.  </li>
            <li>You have to replace the whole thing...very clever, Chi, get people to spend more money.</li>
            <li>it worked, it was good, other than i kept burning my ears</li>
            <li>It should be replaced with the right item</li>
            <li>that they send you the right thing the first time.</li>
            <li>I received this product only a few days after I ordered it and its wonderful!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>It produces more than enough heat</li>
            <li>Still practicing to learn how to use the iron properly, but, that is more my issue then the products.  </li>
            <li>What I can say is watch-out because it gets really hot.</li>
            <li>Everything is ok, butI did not noticed the diameter of the iron is too big 1-1/2 inches</li>
            <li>so I decided to get a higher end curling iron</li>
            <li>with all the waste in the world why on earth would I want to throw out a perfectly good curling iron....</li>
            <li>Why would I spend $35.00 on a new curling iron when my iron is perfect except for a broken $1.00 spring.</li>
            <li>It is quite large in size, complete with a comfort grip handle, so I don&#x27;t expect those who travel lightly like I do to be packing it along for excursions.  </li>
            <li>it was nicely wrapped and packed in a box with other stuff, but it is dead.&lt;br /&gt;while</li>
            <li>I would certainly recommend this product to others, however, because of its ease, heat retention, and (I hope) durability.</li>
            <li>You can change the temperature easily, it curls evenly, it heats quickly, and the curls hold for longer than any other curling iron I have used.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve performed my own little experiment:</li>
            <li>Heats up fast - yes.&lt;br /&gt;Holds a curl - not on your life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>however the cord is much lighter.  </li>
            <li>I did need to use a spray or pomade in order to get a better hold, but that was expected.</li>
            <li>(My friend actually did the curling, and did a fantastic job).  </li>
            <li>Bought this as a spare to keep in my office - didn&#x27;t want to carry my original Chi iron back and forth on workout days.  </li>
            <li>I put one of the hot tools brand springs on my Chi iron (not a perfect fit but works like new now) and now I have two really nice irons.</li>
            <li>So I figured it was worth the extra dollars to buy them.</li>
            <li>If I were to complete this transaction over again, I would have bought the 1\\&quot; iron because the large diameter of the 1 1/2\\&quot; curling iron does not create many ringlets due to the fact that my hair is not very long (i.e. at or below my shoulder blades).  </li>
            <li>and they would send me a brand new curling iron *cha ching in their pockets</li>
            <li>I instead ordered a hot tools brand iron which INCLUDES two extra springs.</li>
            <li>After about an hour, the curl is gone - completely gone.  </li>
            <li>and i took it to a place to get it fixed</li>
            <li>And you can&#x27;t get them fixed anywhere that I have found.</li>
            <li>and I shouldn&#x27;t have to do anything for that to happen other than return the first item.</li>
            <li>I figured I&#x27;d call up Chi direct and order some new springs (CHEAP part, very common to bread)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s tight, heats up quickly, and has a digital temp setting.  </li>
            <li>The customer service is pretty much non-existent and rude....</li>
            <li>one day the old curling iron, the next day the CHI.  </li>
            <li>It is not user friendly as you need to manually set the timer each occassion its used and the procedure to set the timer is bulky to say the least.  </li>
            <li>I have thick, normal texture hair and unless I take a large quanity of hair into the curler, the clip is not tight enough to hold it.  </li>

            <li> This new device is the same price and model that I had previously but is of lessor quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m curious to see how long this one will last me.  </li>
            <li> I have thick hair that will not hold curls very well</li>
            <li> bought this because my other 1 1/2\\&quot; curling iron is starting to give up.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to blow dry my hair anymore.</li>
            <li> This curling iron is not nearly the same quality as my previous device and not nearly as convenient.  </li>
            <li> The one problem I do face when using this CHI curling iron is that the results do not last terribly long -- usually not more than six to eight hours (and consequently not overnight).  </li>
            <li> Be careful of purchasing this product from Omni.  </li>
            <li> Mine only worked for a few months and then died</li>
            <li> I have thick, moderately straight hair that falls a few inches below the shoulder.  </li>
            <li> They sent the wrong item and then told me that to get the right item I had to return what I had purchased and buy it again and pay for shipping again.</li>
            <li> The curls straighten up faster than with other irons I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t damage hair but the curl power isn&#x27;t very extreme with this.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t grab and hold onto it as tightly as I would like it to.</li>
            <li> You would think that when you pay $100 for a curling iron that it would work a little longer than that.</li>
            <li> I typically set my iron to 400 F, a temperature reached in about two to three minutes -- no complaints!  </li>
            <li> It is expensive but worth the money if you have difficult hair.</li>
            <li> , i guess i am not good at it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only disappointed about this because of the price of the curling iron.  </li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the plates started to peel off.</li>
            <li> How did it become my problem that they sent the wrong item.</li>
            <li> Ridiculous!!!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s what you call horrible customer service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Terrible!!</li>
            <li> awful,</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Bought this as a spare to keep in my office - didn&#x27;t want to carry my original Chi iron back and forth on workout days.  This one is even better than the original (red) one.  It&#x27;s tight, heats up quickly, and has a digital temp setting.  I ended up taking my original to the office and keeping this one at home!  Love it!</li>
            <li> Heats up fast - yes.&lt;br /&gt;Holds a curl - not on your life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this because my other 1 1/2\\&quot; curling iron is starting to give up.  The clip no longer \\&quot;clips\\&quot; which makes it the entire process take longer than it should.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was willing to spend a bit more on a curling iron for a better quality experience.  And this just doesn&#x27;t deliver.  After about an hour, the curl is gone - completely gone.  I&#x27;ve performed my own little experiment: one day the old curling iron, the next day the CHI.  It&#x27;s the CHI.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the highest heat setting, held the hair on the barrel until there&#x27;s even a bit of discomforting smoke.  Nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy this item.</li>
            <li> Be careful of purchasing this product from Omni.  The manufacturer&#x27;s warranty is not valid and they only guarantee it for 30 days.  Mine only worked for a few months and then died and I have no recourse.</li>
            <li> The item I ordered was not the item I received.  I guess it they would have sent the correct item.  I could give a better review. I was a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am by no means a hairstyling guru, but this product is easy and comfortable to use.  It is quite large in size, complete with a comfort grip handle, so I don&#x27;t expect those who travel lightly like I do to be packing it along for excursions.  The temperature control is a definite asset, and ranges from 200-400 F.  I typically set my iron to 400 F, a temperature reached in about two to three minutes -- no complaints!  The tool maintains its heat evenly so that curls are uniform.  I haven&#x27;t encountered any problems with heat damage to my hair, either, although I do not curl my hair more than twice weekly.  The one problem I do face when using this CHI curling iron is that the results do not last terribly long -- usually not more than six to eight hours (and consequently not overnight).  I have thick, moderately straight hair that falls a few inches below the shoulder.  This iron may in fact be better for someone with longer hair.  If I were to complete this transaction over again, I would have bought the 1\\&quot; iron because the large diameter of the 1 1/2\\&quot; curling iron does not create many ringlets due to the fact that my hair is not very long (i.e. at or below my shoulder blades).  I would certainly recommend this product to others, however, because of its ease, heat retention, and (I hope) durability.</li>
            <li> I received this product only a few days after I ordered it and its wonderful! Thanks!</li>
            <li> Wife can&#x27;t stop raving about it. I have to get her the smaller one now too.</li>
            <li> UPDATE: After 1 1/2 years of use the spring to open the iron broke. I figured I&#x27;d call up Chi direct and order some new springs (CHEAP part, very common to bread) Chi does not sell ANY parts for their products. Instead they wanted me to send them $35.00 and they would send me a brand new curling iron *cha ching in their pockets*. Why would I spend $35.00 on a new curling iron when my iron is perfect except for a broken $1.00 spring. I instead ordered a hot tools brand iron which INCLUDES two extra springs. I put one of the hot tools brand springs on my Chi iron (not a perfect fit but works like new now) and now I have two really nice irons. The point is....with all the waste in the world why on earth would I want to throw out a perfectly good curling iron....the landfill doesn&#x27;t need this. On top of that, why would I want to spend so much money for what should be a cheap and easy fix, and why didn&#x27;t customer service seem concerned about this? I even passed it on to upper management where they said they would pass it on even further up the ladder, of course I never heard anything further about it. I will no longer support Chi and their wasteful scheming ways.       Doesn&#x27;t damage hair but the curl power isn&#x27;t very extreme with this. The curls straighten up faster than with other irons I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this curling iron.  However, it only lasted me close to four months.  I&#x27;m only disappointed about this because of the price of the curling iron.  I just ordered me another one.  I&#x27;m curious to see how long this one will last me.  I&#x27;ll gladly change my review to 5 stars if the life span is longer on this one.</li>
            <li> Bought this Iron last year for my wife&#x27;s birthday and 10 months later it stopped working. When it did work she absolutely loved it and now wants another one. I don&#x27;t know what the life span of an Iron is, but I would think more than 10 months??</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this curly iron. I don&#x27;t have to blow dry my hair anymore. The 1 1/2 size is great for creating perfect waves. I love it !!</li>
            <li> Ive had this curling iron for about a year and loved it! Heats up very quickly, leaves beautiful curls and was easy to use. Unfortunately, the plates started to peel off. I don&#x27;t know if its because I had it on the highest setting most of the time but it&#x27;s a shame because I really loved it. It pulls out my hair now because the plates are wearing off so I stopped using it. I just purchased a hot tools curling iron based on the great reviews on here. So we&#x27;ll see how that goes!</li>
            <li> I had a CHI curling iron for 6 years so when it stopped working I replaced it with what I thought would be the same item.  This curling iron is not nearly the same quality as my previous device and not nearly as convenient.  It produces more than enough heat however the cord is much lighter.  I have thick, normal texture hair and unless I take a large quanity of hair into the curler, the clip is not tight enough to hold it.  There are no instructions on the operation of the timer so you are on your own to figure it out.  It is not user friendly as you need to manually set the timer each occassion its used and the procedure to set the timer is bulky to say the least.  This new device is the same price and model that I had previously but is of lessor quality.</li>
            <li> only used it a couple of times now but it has done a great job...no problems yet</li>
            <li> Still practicing to learn how to use the iron properly, but, that is more my issue then the products.  What I can say is watch-out because it gets really hot.</li>
            <li> Everything is ok, butI did not noticed the diameter of the iron is too big 1-1/2 inches and I can not use it for my hair. I don&#x27;t now if I can change the product for 1\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I love this curling iron.  I have thick hair that will not hold curls very well so I decided to get a higher end curling iron and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this one.  You can change the temperature easily, it curls evenly, it heats quickly, and the curls hold for longer than any other curling iron I have used.  It is expensive but worth the money if you have difficult hair.</li>
            <li> I do like the Curling Iron.  I don&#x27;t feel it is damaging to my hair.  What I don&#x27;t like about it is I have very fine hair so it doesn&#x27;t grab and hold onto it as tightly as I would like it to.</li>
            <li> it was a great product but when i moved i have no idea what happened to it it just stopped working and i took it to a place to get it fixed but they could not fix it either. it was nicely wrapped and packed in a box with other stuff, but it is dead.&lt;br /&gt;while it worked, it was good, other than i kept burning my ears, i guess i am not good at it.</li>
            <li> It was a good purchase, especially for the price. I think it gives a nice effect of big waves and curls. I did need to use a spray or pomade in order to get a better hold, but that was expected. Doesn&#x27;t fry hair, but gives it a VERY nice shine. Overall a good product.</li>
            <li> They sent the wrong item and then told me that to get the right item I had to return what I had purchased and buy it again and pay for shipping again. How did it become my problem that they sent the wrong item. It should be replaced with the right item and I shouldn&#x27;t have to do anything for that to happen other than return the first item. That&#x27;s what you call horrible customer service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope that they send you the right thing the first time.</li>
            <li> I had this curling iron 1 month and it already stopped working. You would think that when you pay $100 for a curling iron that it would work a little longer than that. Terrible!!</li>
            <li> This is the best curling iron I&#x27;ve gotten so far. It heats up quickly and doesn&#x27;t burn my hair. I love and recommend it!</li>
            <li> This ceramic curling iron is by far one of the best I&#x27;ve ever used, heats up fast and doesn&#x27;t damage my hair, I would definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> I have had 3 or 4 of these curling irons. I liked the first one so much that I quickly bought one for home and one for gym, one for another gym so I wouldn&#x27;t have to cart them around. They do THE best job. So I figured it was worth the extra dollars to buy them. HOWEVER, NONE of them have lasted...of course, they go just beyond the warranty then the clip breaks and you can&#x27;t use it any more. Chi does not have replacement parts!!!!!! Ridiculous!!! And you can&#x27;t get them fixed anywhere that I have found. The customer service is pretty much non-existent and rude....awful, awful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read on-line that for most curling irons, the clip is the first thing to go and you can buy that part and fix it yourself, for most irons...BUT oh no, not with the Chi. You have to replace the whole thing...very clever, Chi, get people to spend more money. But never again...I will find something else that will do the job just as well!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope people realize that they have a product that is good for about 13-18 months and then it falls apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone knows how you can replace the clip or find someone who can replace it, let me know.</li>
            <li> My hair does not curl easily, but I wanted to give this a try for my beach wedding since I was doing my own hair.  It worked!  (My friend actually did the curling, and did a fantastic job).  I did use a product prior to curling, but used no product afterwards and my big beachy curls lasted thru the wind and the dancing!!</li>
