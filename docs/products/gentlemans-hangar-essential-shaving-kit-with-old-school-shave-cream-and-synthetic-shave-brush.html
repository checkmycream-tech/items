            <li>great shaving cream...for the price,nothing that you can buy at a drug store will beat this product,leaves your face like smooth and you get a very close shave.....</li>
            <li>Good product, fast shipping</li>
            <li>The shaving cream and the bowl were fine.</li>
            <li>The cup and brush work fine for their purpose</li>

            <li>, I am a first time user and love it</li>
            <li>great older style product made new again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Grabbed it when it was on special.</li>
            <li>I soak mine in hot water while I&#x27;m in the shower and then use it when I get out.</li>
            <li>Good lather from cream, brush pretty stiff.</li>
            <li>went to the classic way of doing the things right.</li>
            <li>Shortly after I posted my experience, I was contacted by the owner of Gentleman&#x27;s Hangar, and he apologized and told me he was sending me a new brush and some more shaving cream.</li>
            <li>; that is, not shaving very often.</li>
            <li>I purchased this for my husband&#x27;s birthday and he absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>(I now think, I was probably using too much of the cream.)</li>
            <li>This cream goes on easy and is a smooth shave - no more nicks.</li>
            <li>synthetic brush is very soft and makes it easy for lathering in a bowl or on your face.&lt;br /&gt;The bowl was a little small but is great for travel.&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li>The shaving cream was nice, but didn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li>This is exactly the old school type shaving kit that I wanted.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t find any other vegan brush for less than $100 and this seems to work great.</li>
            <li>a few minutes later i got a response from them with a link to buy with the discounted price couldn&#x27;t believe it peoppe who actually care about there customers i will never buy from anyone else as i am happy with everything they provided including the service.</li>
            <li>If the new handle falls off too I will glue it on myself.</li>
            <li>I found some other cool products on the website that I may try out as well.</li>
            <li>I received this kit as a prize for a neighborhood arm wrestling competition and it has really added some zing to my daily shaving routine.  </li>
            <li>So classy......</li>
            <li>Still like my old spice mug.</li>
            <li>It lathers quickly and has a slight scent that isnt overpowering.</li>
            <li>You really do only need a small amount for a full lather.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m a writer and so I&#x27;ve appropriated the rights and privileges of said profession; that is, not shaving very often. But when I do - when my wife starts to complain about my &amp;#34;five foot long beard&amp;#34; (c&#x27;mon, it&#x27;s not five feet, babe, it&#x27;s three) - I like to use shaving kits that don&#x27;t mess up my skin too much, which is prone to irritation. This kit does the trick.</li>
            <li> Amazing!  I purchased this for my husband&#x27;s birthday and he absolutely loves it. We will be a repeat customer for sure!</li>
            <li> I received this kit as a prize for a neighborhood arm wrestling competition and it has really added some zing to my daily shaving routine.  I&#x27;m not one to go get this kind of thing on my own, but I&#x27;ve loved using it so I grabbed one for my dentist.  He&#x27;s a hairy fellow.  All around good feel, brush seems well-made and cream is a bit nicer than what I&#x27;m used to.  I found some other cool products on the website that I may try out as well.</li>
            <li> Just arrived brush is soft,cup fits your hand ✋ and shaving soap is rich.Great job guys Amazon is the best... Mc</li>
            <li> So classy......great older style product made new again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect gift item with great packaging for any man.</li>
            <li> Amazing product. Gives a great lather and perfect shave</li>
            <li> This is very nice shaving cream.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great i love the smell of it. Works great and its made in the usa. Also i missed a promotion that was going on and ask on Facebook if they could do another sell on the after shave a few minutes later i got a response from them with a link to buy with the discounted price couldn&#x27;t believe it peoppe who actually care about there customers i will never buy from anyone else as i am happy with everything they provided including the service.</li>
            <li> Amazing feeling for my shave and was easy to figure out how to mix and apply, I am a first time user and love it</li>
            <li> Good lather from cream, brush pretty stiff. Still like my old spice mug.</li>
            <li> I and my wife share an Amazon account so I am leaving this review under her name.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent kit. I&#x27;ve used the cream before and love the lather you are able to achieve with it!&lt;br /&gt;The synthetic brush is very soft and makes it easy for lathering in a bowl or on your face.&lt;br /&gt;The bowl was a little small but is great for travel.&lt;br /&gt;Nice setup for a traditional shave.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t find any other vegan brush for less than $100 and this seems to work great.</li>
            <li> This is a great kit for a great price</li>
            <li> great shaving cream...for the price,nothing that you can buy at a drug store will beat this product,leaves your face like smooth and you get a very close shave.....a little goes a long way...tap your shaving brush with water and that&#x27;s about it...</li>
            <li> Gotta love a good shave kit!</li>
            <li> I gave it as a gift and my husband loved it. He says the shaving cream is especially nice.&lt;br /&gt;I just ordered another one as a gift</li>
            <li> This is exactly the old school type shaving kit that I wanted. My son loves &amp;#34;throwback&amp;#34; products and will recommend it to his friends! Keep up the good work.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing. Perfect kit. got it for my barbershop. Good price too!</li>
            <li> The brush separated from the handle after 3 uses , I guess I can glue it . But I must commend on the shaving cream. I will def buy it again . The smell is amazing and it feels great !! Just need to do Bette on the brush .</li>
            <li> When I&#x27;m in my beard mode a soft but firm brush and smoothing cream is a must. Honestly, it&#x27;s not a rocket science and it&#x27;s hard to reinvent a &amp;#34;shaving cream &amp; brush&amp;#34; but this is exactly the point! The Hangar instead of reinventing simply brough the &amp;#34;old school&amp;#34; style back to life and with the utter attention to details went to the classic way of doing the things right. The brush is pleasant to use, the bowl is just the right size and the cream is &amp;#34;like the father&#x27;s soap but better&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I&#x27;m on the road I use my Panasonic but with the save kit it&#x27;s yet another reason to come home:-)</li>
            <li> The shaving cream and the bowl were fine. The handle fell off the brush on my fourth shave. There was almost no glue holding the bristles to the handle. I have returned it for a replacement. If the new handle falls off too I will glue it on myself.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I&#x27;ve never used a shaving brush before, but it makes a difference. And I was sick of always nicking my neck with my cheap shaving cream. This cream goes on easy and is a smooth shave - no more nicks. I&#x27;ll be ordering again soon.</li>
            <li> Grabbed it when it was on special. Great value for the money. Good shave brush. I soak mine in hot water while I&#x27;m in the shower and then use it when I get out. Works great.</li>
            <li> Good product, fast shipping</li>
            <li> Fantastic soap and is my go to even when compared to proraso and my artisan soaps. It lathers quickly and has a slight scent that isnt overpowering. You really do only need a small amount for a full lather. The cup and brush work fine for their purpose but im just used to a larger shaving mug. This is my second container of this soap and I do not regret it.</li>
            <li> The shaving brush is very nice and the shaving cream is very nice and soothing.</li>
            <li> I have had this shave kit less then a month, the brush came apart from the handle and is now unusable. The shaving cream was nice, but didn&#x27;t last very long. The bowl is probably too small for a puck of soap, but works well with the cream.  EDIT: Shortly after I posted my experience, I was contacted by the owner of Gentleman&#x27;s Hangar, and he apologized and told me he was sending me a new brush and some more shaving cream. (I now think, I was probably using too much of the cream.) Made me feel really good, I wasn&#x27;t expecting it. (As I said before, the shaving cream is really nice. The random brush breaking, might have been a fluke, I am not sure yet.) I am changing my rating from three stars to four.</li>
