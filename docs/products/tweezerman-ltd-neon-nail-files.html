    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with these Nail Files.</li>
            <li>These are the greatest nail files ever.</li>
            <li>and these are the best nail files I&#x27;ve ever tried...which is a lot because I do my nails all the time.</li>
            <li>They have been perfect for that purpose.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been very happy with everything else I&#x27;ve purchased from this line.</li>
            <li>They allow me to get the perfect oval shape on my nails.</li>
            <li>I love the colors and the grit of these files!!!  </li>
            <li>Work Great... Would buy again.</li>
            <li>You will love them!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>After all the great reviews I was expecting something that would smooth my nails.</li>
            <li>I have seen glass/ceramic nail files many times with the bright and graduated rainbow colors, so I believed that these were just like them.  </li>
            <li>These are absolutely the very best nail files on the planet!  </li>
            <li>nice selection of boards</li>
            <li>These are some very strong files, so they can handle both your fingernails and your toenails.</li>
            <li>These are great for $5 and the colors are fun.</li>
            <li>I do recommend these for sure.</li>
            <li>I love the Tweezerman brand.</li>
            <li>I love these nail files, they work as they should</li>
            <li>and now I can file my nails properly and perfectly.</li>
            <li>Love these files.</li>
            <li>Very useful after you cut your nails with a nail cutter!</li>
            <li>The smooth side is great for finishing or filing at a 45 degree angle to remove a tiny bit of wrap from the tip to keep the edges from lifting.  </li>
            <li>I love the colors, that&#x27;s why I chose these, But really more appropriate for professional use on acrylic nails.</li>
            <li>The rougher side is similar to the grit on the file that comes with the Jamberry application kit, and is great for the initial removal of the excess wrap.  </li>
            <li>Worked well for me doing my acrylic nails at home, exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>This is the first Tweezerman product I have EVER</li>
            <li>These are good files and very similar  to the glass style (as in Cheeky) and have a similar thickness.</li>
            <li>Four stars instead of five because a tiny bit of color does come off on my nails when I use them, but that is easily dusted off.</li>
            <li>Really durable files and easy to keep track with the different colors.</li>
            <li>These nail files are great - they have a variety of different grit levels, so you can really use these to file down your nails as well as shape your nails after.  </li>
            <li>but the grit held up very well</li>
            <li>The files are very durable.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an alright file,  colors will come off and the pink rubs off the most.</li>
            <li>On each file one side is a bit smoother for cuticles-not too smooth it still files them, and then a harder/more gritty sides for acrylic nails or exfoliating your feet.</li>
            <li>I really like them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather use the cheap, generic emery boards.</li>
            <li>I would not buy these again, arrived within a decent time range.</li>
            <li>These will definitely sand them down but they do not leave a nice edge.</li>
            <li>and they came in brand new condition.</li>
            <li>Way more coarse than I expected.  </li>
            <li>So if your nails are very soft, they may not be for you.</li>
            <li>Cool colors, rough sand; but</li>
            <li>I really hope it the last.</li>
            <li>Which is why I&#x27;m surprised they are not glass.</li>
            <li>They are fun colors, but the color flakes off during each use, and the surface is so rough that is has damaged the surface of my nails.  </li>
            <li>Neon Nail Files are firm, useful and highly visible.  </li>
            <li>They do work, and I really appreciated that the one I have came with a little case,</li>

            <li> I will certainly not reorder, although this is the only one of the Tweezerman line I really have not liked.</li>
            <li> At least they won&#x27;t break when I drop them (which is why I&#x27;m needing new ones!).</li>
            <li> I also use them to file the dry skin along the nail and it keeps the cuticle from peeling.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had no issue with the color coming off (but my hands are always dry when using them).</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t know how it would be possible to file the corner edges of my nails into the slightly rounded shape I prefer without damaging the skin on the tips of my fingers.  </li>
            <li> I carry a nail file with me at all time because if my nail chips, or breaks, or develops a rough edge, i need to file it IMMEDIATELY</li>
            <li> I like the fact that the nail file is re-usable, and doesn&#x27;t seem to wear down as easily as ordinary emery boards, but the file itself is very stiff and hard, and not that comfortable to work with.  </li>
            <li> I love my other Tweezerman products, but I&#x27;m disappointed with the quality of these files.  </li>
            <li> I bought these because it&#x27;s hard to find a specific brand of nail files in store</li>
            <li> Finally, they are really, really thick</li>
            <li> and they were thick, sturdy files.</li>
            <li> But they are very hard nail files.</li>
            <li> I am not impressed.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> Worked well for me doing my acrylic nails at home, exactly what I was looking for. I only do my nails every two weeks but the grit held up very well and they were thick, sturdy files.</li>
            <li> I love the colors and the grit of these files!!!  I&#x27;m very happy with these Nail Files.</li>
            <li> These are absolutely the very best nail files on the planet!  My daughter had some and I looked everywhere and finally found them!  I also use them to file the dry skin along the nail and it keeps the cuticle from peeling.  The files are very durable.</li>
            <li> nice selection of boards</li>
            <li> These are the greatest nail files ever. They are the only ones I have bought for years. But them!  You will love them!</li>
            <li> After all the great reviews I was expecting something that would smooth my nails. These will definitely sand them down but they do not leave a nice edge.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an alright file,  colors will come off and the pink rubs off the most. I would not buy these again, arrived within a decent time range.</li>
            <li> I am not impressed.  I did not know that these are EMORY BOARDS, I ordered what I believed were going to be nail FILES.  In additional to them being improperly named (in my opinion), I was fooled by the colors.  I have seen glass/ceramic nail files many times with the bright and graduated rainbow colors, so I believed that these were just like them.  I&#x27;ve never seen multicolored emory boards before.  Finally, they are really, really thick and I don&#x27;t know how it would be possible to file the corner edges of my nails into the slightly rounded shape I prefer without damaging the skin on the tips of my fingers.  This is the first Tweezerman product I have EVER felt that wasn&#x27;t a 5 star product.  I really hope it the last.</li>
            <li> I bought these because it&#x27;s hard to find a specific brand of nail files in store and these are the best nail files I&#x27;ve ever tried...which is a lot because I do my nails all the time.

            <li> I love the Tweezerman brand. These are some very strong files, so they can handle both your fingernails and your toenails. The added bonus for me were the neon colors. I really like them. But they are very hard nail files. So if your nails are very soft, they may not be for you.</li>
            <li> Cool colors, rough sand; but that&#x27;s what I was looking for. Packaging protected items and they came in brand new condition.</li>
            <li> I love these nail files, they work as they should and now I can file my nails properly and perfectly. Love it!</li>

They do work, and I really appreciated that the one I have came with a little case, but I prefer the old-fashioned emery boards, which are thinner and easier to get underneath my short nails.</li>
            <li> Work Great... Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Tweezerman LTD Neon Nail Files are firm, useful and highly visible.  We keep them in vehicles and around the house for those times when jagged nails just won&#x27;t wait.</li>
            <li> Way more coarse than I expected.  I love the colors, that&#x27;s why I chose these, But really more appropriate for professional use on acrylic nails.</li>
            <li> the colors of the board sheds all over your clothes and whatever your filing over. also the colors get suck in your nails.</li>
            <li> These are great for $5 and the colors are fun.</li>
            <li> Very useful after you cut your nails with a nail cutter!</li>
            <li> I got these to use with my Jamberry nail wraps.  They have been perfect for that purpose.  Each file has a rougher side and a smoother side.  The rougher side is similar to the grit on the file that comes with the Jamberry application kit, and is great for the initial removal of the excess wrap.  The smooth side is great for finishing or filing at a 45 degree angle to remove a tiny bit of wrap from the tip to keep the edges from lifting.  Four stars instead of five because a tiny bit of color does come off on my nails when I use them, but that is easily dusted off.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had to use them but I know I can find them anywhere I put them. How can you not find them!</li>
            <li> ...Ends up UNDER YOUR NAILS and on the edges of them - so beware. I will certainly not reorder, although this is the only one of the Tweezerman line I really have not liked. I&#x27;ve been very happy with everything else I&#x27;ve purchased from this line.</li>
            <li> I love my other Tweezerman products, but I&#x27;m disappointed with the quality of these files.  They are fun colors, but the color flakes off during each use, and the surface is so rough that is has damaged the surface of my nails.  I&#x27;d rather use the cheap, generic emery boards.</li>
            <li> I carry a nail file with me at all time because if my nail chips, or breaks, or develops a rough edge, i need to file it IMMEDIATELY or else i start biting my nails.  These nail files are great - they have a variety of different grit levels, so you can really use these to file down your nails as well as shape your nails after.  They allow me to get the perfect oval shape on my nails.</li>
            <li> Love these files. They also last longer than cheaper ones.</li>
