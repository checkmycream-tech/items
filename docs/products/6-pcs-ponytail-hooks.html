            <li>Made with excellent quality!</li>
            <li>Great!</li>
            <li>Awesome Ponytail Hooks</li>
            <li>I Get A Perfect Ponytail Everytime</li>
            <li>It Would Pull On My Hair, These Are AMAZING !!!!</li>
            <li>Love these things!</li>
            <li>Love them ,perfect pony tail for second!!!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love these.</li>
            <li>Hooks were ok.</li>
            <li>They hold the hair so much better than a pony holder does</li>
            <li>Good quality, fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Make hair styling so easy since I have a huge Afro</li>
            <li>My goal was to secure my clients who wear Sisterlocks ponytails in place.</li>
            <li>So the rigid portion of this &#x27;Bungee Band&#x27; is a full inch, meaning that when the band conforms to the circle forming a pony tail, two rigid 1&amp;#34; pieces cannot conform to this circle.</li>
            <li>I was super excited to receive these, but the first one I used broke- the hook snapped off.</li>
            <li>Better than any regular ponytail holders.</li>
            <li>The diagram shows hooking the two hooks together, which could work with very bulky &amp;#34;dos&amp;#34; but for very fine hair the hook needs to be about 1/3 as long as this hook is.</li>
            <li>The bungee bands are great for long thick hair.</li>
            <li>I had to hunt them down, but was so glad to finally find them!</li>
            <li>Much prefer these to regular pony holders and would recommend to all!</li>
            <li>The bands are extremely short and don&#x27;t really stretch.</li>
            <li>I love these ponytail holders because they minimize unnecessary  hair damage.</li>
            <li>I have really think hair and need a tight hold</li>

            <li> I was super excited to receive these, but the first one I used broke- the hook snapped off. I thought: maybe just a fluke. Nope. I purchased 24 of them, no joke, 20 of them broke. Half of them before even finishing wrapping it around the hair. They are so flimsy. I was so annoyed and so was the team that I was training. We ended up just using regular elastic, worked like charm like it always does.</li>
            <li> I love these ponytail holders because they minimize unnecessary  hair damage.</li>
            <li> No good at all for fine, thin hair. I can&#x27;t believe that even very thick hair can be held by these hooks! The hooks are too long, and they are fastened to the cord with another rigid piece of (metal?/plastic?) that extends the rigid section another quarter of an inch. So the rigid portion of this &#x27;Bungee Band&#x27; is a full inch, meaning that when the band conforms to the circle forming a pony tail, two rigid 1&amp;#34; pieces cannot conform to this circle. The diagram shows hooking the two hooks together, which could work with very bulky &amp;#34;dos&amp;#34; but for very fine hair the hook needs to be about 1/3 as long as this hook is. I had some long ago that had a short hook. Wish I could find them again!</li>

            <li> Holds thick hair.  Great!</li>
            <li> Awesome Ponytail Hooks I Get A Perfect Ponytail Everytime I Put These In. Usually With A Ponyhail Holder When I Would Pull It Out At Night To Let It Down It Would Pull On My Hair, These Are AMAZING !!!! I Will Be Getting These Again Soon Just In Case I Lose All Mine</li>
            <li> I had some of these years ago and they finally wore out. I had to hunt them down, but was so glad to finally find them! Much prefer these to regular pony holders and would recommend to all!</li>
            <li> Love them ,perfect pony tail for second!!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these. And they last forever...</li>
            <li> Better than any regular ponytail holders. I won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> Terrible product for what I wanted them to do. My goal was to secure my clients who wear Sisterlocks ponytails in place. It was difficult to get them to hook and unhook.</li>
