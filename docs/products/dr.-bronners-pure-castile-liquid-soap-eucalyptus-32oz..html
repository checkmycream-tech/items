            <li>Absolutely love this soap!</li>

            <li>The product is very well made and quality is excellent.  </li>
            <li>I also bought my own ph testing strips to confirm it.</li>
            <li>Nice - would have been nice if the fragrance was stronger, but it&#x27;s okay as it is.</li>
            <li>This is a natural wonderful smelling staple in our house.</li>
            <li>I liked the peppermint better</li>
            <li>while this one isn&#x27;t exactly my favorite as far as smell goes, orange eucalyptus/citrus (?) is the best, it still does any job you use it for.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the most economical, safe, great smelling (we prefer the eucalyptus) product ever invented.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Totally safe around babies.</li>

            <li>I love showering with this soap.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>I need to expand my uses with it, but I have been more than pleased.</li>
            <li>My favorite scents are peppermint and eucalyptus.  </li>
            <li>I recently mixed 1 part glycerine with 1 part doc Bronner&#x27;s to get a wonderful hand soap and shower</li>
            <li>Bronner&#x27;s really is magical stuff.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I found myself smelling my arms and hands because I enjoyed the aroma.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fantastic product!</li>
            <li>Love this soap, so does my husband.</li>
            <li>Bar soaps could be better, and I prefer liquids.</li>
            <li>Also interesting to note, I&#x27;ve used many shampoos on pets and people throughout the years, but this stuff rinses out cleanly without residue.  </li>
            <li>The best soap on the market, try all other products also.</li>
            <li>can’t tell you how many soaps I&#x27;ve bought that claimed to “rinse clean”, yet leave a slimy residue unless you stand under the water for 10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love it,excellent price,all natural,so clean can be used to sanitize fruit and vegetables</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not so strong</li>
            <li>I have used the lavender scent, especially in baths before bedtime as it is relaxing, the peppermint is invigorating, and my favorite is a the rose with a sweet, not overbearing rose scent.  </li>
            <li>He has had none of the skin issues from blocked pores that he experienced formerly with bar soaps.  </li>
            <li>Was a great buy and it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>LOVE it and dare  you to attempt to read the whole label!</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve found this product to be the most effective and instant insect killer ever.  </li>
            <li>We use it to clean EVERYTHING.</li>
            <li>I use this to clean dishes, floors and my body.  </li>
            <li>and I use it as shower gel, face wash, dog shampoo, sometimes I clean my dishes with it, and I still have a full bottle and my travel sized one</li>
            <li>A quick rinse and your skin is squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving it two stars instead of one because they actually use good ingredients.</li>
            <li>Isn&#x27;t it enough to have your values represented in the ingredients and fair trade affiliation?</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s REAL soap (made from saponified oils, as opposed to synthetic detergents).</li>
            <li>of course, it&#x27;s also great for shampooing and washing and a million other uses.</li>
            <li>I only use one teaspoon diluted in about 1/2 cup of warm water to wash a fully packed largest load my huge washer will hold.</li>
            <li>Started using Dr Bronners liquid soaps four years ago, and remain a loyal fan.  </li>
            <li>Super concentrated.</li>
            <li>i love dr bronners soaps mainly because they&#x27;re vegan.</li>
            <li>Really cleans well and rinses off easily.  </li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>The price might be high, but it&#x27;ll easily take me months to get through this one bottle.  </li>
            <li>My skin is soft, and I&#x27;m very clean.</li>
            <li>Cleans sticky substances right off, glue, syrup, resins.</li>
            <li>i love the size and definitely get my moneys worth with the two package deal.</li>
            <li>At first you will want to think you need to use more than you need but you really only need the smallest amount.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been buying this for a few months now as a hand soap, and simply love its gentle feel and refreshing fragrance.</li>
            <li>I love how there is Eucalyptus essential oil in it.</li>
            <li>sure enough, it was well over 9.</li>
            <li>Immediately upon the first use, he stopped scratching so much and slept through the night.  </li>
            <li>It works great for dry skin relieving that dry skin itch of the winter.  </li>
            <li>it really tingles.  </li>
            <li>Its a totally different clean.</li>
            <li>Later I read articles about strong alkaline soaps destroying the top acid mantle of our skin.</li>
            <li>We use it mainly for bathing.</li>
            <li>Highly recomment this item.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this soap for a few years and the eucalyptus is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I am switching to this brand, especially since they are supporting GMO labeling.</li>
            <li>I put a small pump top in the bottles for dispersion in the shower, for ease of use.  </li>
            <li>used Eucalyptus flavour, so far...</li>
            <li>Things get clean without the harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li>Seriously, its magical.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve definitely found my new bath/shower gel.  </li>
            <li>Back in 1983 when we were white water raft guides is how I learned about it, the national park where we took some canoe trips only allowed Dr. Bronners to be used to wash with in the lake as it so pure and causes no damage.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve yet to try it as a general purpose household cleaner, but I think it will work well.</li>
            <li>Same for cleaning the kitchen and bathroom, just one teaspoon diluted in a small bucket of hot water cleans the whole room.</li>
            <li>Excellent soap and it washes off early with the horrible AZ water.  </li>
            <li>I was very surprised at how long this soap will last.  </li>

            <li> I was very surprised at how long this soap will last.  </li>
            <li> it knocks you over, but very subtle, yet strong enough.  </li>
            <li> bottle lasts for months because it is so concentrated and a tiny, tiny bit goes such a long way.</li>
            <li> This is a must have for anytime, but definitely during the dry winter weather.  </li>
            <li> After about 2 months, I noticed that my face had a LOT of blemishes and it would turn dark even with few minutes of gentle sun exposure.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s somewhat pricy, but 32 oz goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to try the other scents, but this bottle will last me a long long time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not kidding when I say this stuff can be used in an endless number of ways: hand soap, dish soap, laundry soap, shower gel, shaving soap, TOOTHPASTE!, all purpose cleaner, wood cleaner, car cleaner, dog cleaner, facial cleanser, toilet cleaner, and on and on and on . . .</li>
            <li> but it does tend to dry out skin.  </li>
            <li> Dr. Bronner actually spent time in mental institutions!  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Since learning about Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soap in 1983, I&#x27;ve gradually eliminated every other cleaning product from our home.</li>
            <li> You use less water to keep yourself cleaner!&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li> so mopping the floors, cleaning all surfaces with a solution of this soap and water is much less toxic.</li>
            <li> I have been using the eucalyptus for awhile now as a laundry detergent, just add a few drops to a half cup of water and pour it in.  </li>
            <li> Although one part of my body itched a little, I ignored it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d hate to know how much money they are they flushing down the toilet because of their nut job rants on the label.</li>
            <li> Just a few drops from the bottle does the trick since it is so concentrated.  </li>
            <li> My husband uses the Eucalyptus, which means alot as he hates heavy scented products.</li>
            <li> No more toxic cleaner smells in our house!!!!</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;ramblings\\&quot; on the label are a tad weird, but it&#x27;s all a part  of the charm.  </li>
            <li> to, is/are how crazy he and his family are/was.</li>

            <li> Excellent soap and it washes off early with the horrible AZ water.  Cleans you well but it does tend to dry out skin.  This goes for all varieties of Castile soap.  I do like it, though.</li>
            <li> This soap has a pleasant eucalyptus fragrance, and it rinses CLEAN.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can’t tell you how many soaps I&#x27;ve bought that claimed to “rinse clean”, yet leave a slimy residue unless you stand under the water for 10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not so with Dr Bronner soap. A quick rinse and your skin is squeaky clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it two stars instead of one because they actually use good ingredients. What a nut job this guy was personally! I don&#x27;t appreciate all the religious rants, which make no sense, on this product. Isn&#x27;t it enough to have your values represented in the ingredients and fair trade affiliation? I&#x27;m returning the product because I don&#x27;t want to support whack jobs like this and his family, who continue to keep the label as a memorial to Dr. Bronner. The only thing it&#x27;s a memorial to, is/are how crazy he and his family are/was. They would all do well to enroll in a business ethics 101 course. I&#x27;d hate to know how much money they are they flushing down the toilet because of their nut job rants on the label. Dr. Bronner actually spent time in mental institutions!  What a shame, I actually wanted to buy this product.  http://www.adweek.com/adfreak/dr-bronner-s-crazy-ass-magic-soap-labels-18606</li>
            <li> This is a must have for anytime, but definitely during the dry winter weather.  It works great for dry skin relieving that dry skin itch of the winter.  Also helps open up my sinuses in the morning.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Can&#x27;t do without it. Was a great buy and it lasts a long time. Worth the money. Cleans great!</li>
            <li> Great soap.  Really cleans well and rinses off easily.  You use less water to keep yourself cleaner!&lt;br /&gt;Only used Eucalyptus flavour, so far...&lt;br /&gt;This soap is perfect for refilling foaming dispensers.  The lather feels GREAT!</li>
            <li> being an organic gardener sometimes has its&#x27; frustrations, like when you are inundated with plant eating insects.  i&#x27;ve found this product to be the most effective and instant insect killer ever.  just mix a tablespoon in a spray bottle and blast them.  it kills on contact.  of course, it&#x27;s also great for shampooing and washing and a million other uses.</li>
            <li> I LOVE Dr Bronner&#x27;s soaps!!  I have been using the eucalyptus for awhile now as a laundry detergent, just add a few drops to a half cup of water and pour it in.  I am a lifetime fan.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised at how long this soap will last.  It has a great Eucalyptus smell and cleans well.  I am switching to this brand, especially since they are supporting GMO labeling.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way. I make my own spray cleaner in a spray bottle I purchased at the dollar store. Things get clean without the harsh chemicals. I have asthma, and two dogs  so mopping the floors, cleaning all surfaces with a solution of this soap and water is much less toxic. We wash our cars with it too and noticed they seem to stay cleaner longer.</li>
            <li> Since learning about Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soap in 1983, I&#x27;ve gradually eliminated every other cleaning product from our home. It&#x27;s the most economical, safe, great smelling (we prefer the eucalyptus) product ever invented. We use it to clean EVERYTHING. Kitchen, bathroom, floors. I use it in my HE front loading washer. One 32 oz. bottle lasts for months because it is so concentrated and a tiny, tiny bit goes such a long way. Our house always smells so good. I even started washing the dogs with it (BE SURE TO DILUTE!!!!!!!) Back in 1983 when we were white water raft guides is how I learned about it, the national park where we took some canoe trips only allowed Dr. Bronners to be used to wash with in the lake as it so pure and causes no damage. Totally safe around babies. We save a fortune now in cleaning products and laundry soap and dish soap that is no longer needed. If you are looking to save money for your family and have a healthy home, this is the way to go. There are articles in the thousands you can find online to read about Dr. Bronners soap. At first you will want to think you need to use more than you need but you really only need the smallest amount. I only use one teaspoon diluted in about 1/2 cup of warm water to wash a fully packed largest load my huge washer will hold. Same for cleaning the kitchen and bathroom, just one teaspoon diluted in a small bucket of hot water cleans the whole room. No more toxic cleaner smells in our house!!!!</li>
            <li> Enough said! The best soap on the market, try all other products also. Good value for the money! Buy it.</li>
            <li> I am very happy w/ this purchase.  The product is very well made and quality is excellent.  Highly recomment this item.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this for a few months now as a hand soap, and simply love its gentle feel and refreshing fragrance. It&#x27;s concentrated, so I diluted it with one part water, still worked great!</li>
            <li> Nice - would have been nice if the fragrance was stronger, but it&#x27;s okay as it is.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this soap!</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome!  I&#x27;ve definitely found my new bath/shower gel.  Love the Eucalyptus smell and it&#x27;s not so strong it knocks you over, but very subtle, yet strong enough.  Just a few drops from the bottle does the trick since it is so concentrated.  It lathers up real nice and I use it all over my body, for my hair and also use it for my face.  Can&#x27;t wait to try the other scents, but this bottle will last me a long long time.  The price might be high, but it&#x27;ll easily take me months to get through this one bottle.  5 stars +</li>
            <li> I am using for everything from the kitchen to the bathroom. I like the smell and it should help to keep away insects</li>
            <li> One of my favorite things ever!</li>
            <li> Love it,excellent price,all natural,so clean can be used to sanitize fruit and vegetables</li>
            <li> I love showering with this soap. Lathers great, and the smell is invigorating! Also works well as a shampoo. It&#x27;s somewhat pricy, but 32 oz goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I&#x27;ve been using it for a year now. I love that it&#x27;s REAL soap (made from saponified oils, as opposed to synthetic detergents). I love how there is Eucalyptus essential oil in it. I&#x27;ve read that Eucalyptus essential oil has anti-viral, anti-bacterial properties. This past month, we ran out of it--and we got sick!!! Coincidence? I don&#x27;t think so.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used drBronner&#x27;s liquid soap for over 40 years!&lt;br /&gt; it is GREAT for washing the dog&amp;#62;but you can wash your hair,skin,clothes,dog,car,dishes,laundry,spray plants and spray around for spiders/spiders hate peppermint.We use it mainly for bathing.LOVE it and dare  you to attempt to read the whole label!</li>
            <li> I bought 2 bottles of eucalyptus a year ago and I use it as shower gel, face wash, dog shampoo, sometimes I clean my dishes with it, and I still have a full bottle and my travel sized one (I poured the big bottle into smaller ones) love it. I need to expand my uses with it, but I have been more than pleased. Will never go back to chemical body wash! Its a totally different clean.</li>
            <li> Started using Dr Bronners liquid soaps four years ago, and remain a loyal fan.  I put a small pump top in the bottles for dispersion in the shower, for ease of use.  A little goes a long way.  I would estimate that one 32 ounce bottle lasts about three months of daily showering for us.  My husband uses the Eucalyptus, which means alot as he hates heavy scented products. Still you can smell it, it is just that earthy and pleasant.  He has had none of the skin issues from blocked pores that he experienced formerly with bar soaps.  I have used the lavender scent, especially in baths before bedtime as it is relaxing, the peppermint is invigorating, and my favorite is a the rose with a sweet, not overbearing rose scent.  The only caveat, dont use the peppermint in your private places.....it really tingles.  LOL.</li>
            <li> I love these soaps! My favorite scents are peppermint and eucalyptus.  This stuff can be used in a multitude of ways, depending on how you cut it or what you mix it with.  I recently mixed 1 part glycerine with 1 part doc Bronner&#x27;s to get a wonderful hand soap and shower \\&quot;gel.\\&quot;  The soap itself is very fluid and I like how the glycerine thickens it up a bit and gives it a silkiness that makes your skin feel wonderful.  The \\&quot;ramblings\\&quot; on the label are a tad weird, but it&#x27;s all a part  of the charm.  I&#x27;m not kidding when I say this stuff can be used in an endless number of ways: hand soap, dish soap, laundry soap, shower gel, shaving soap, TOOTHPASTE!, all purpose cleaner, wood cleaner, car cleaner, dog cleaner, facial cleanser, toilet cleaner, and on and on and on . . . .&lt;br /&gt;Doc Bronner&#x27;s really is magical stuff.  It also lasts forever because it&#x27;s concentrated and you can cut it with water (or glycerine) to stretch it and make it last.  It&#x27;s good stuff. And smells purty!</li>
            <li> This is a natural wonderful smelling staple in our house.</li>
            <li> All I use daily as body wash. Also use as shampoo. I liked the peppermint better but this was good too.. no tingling sensation as with the peppermint. I missed that</li>
            <li> I use this to clean dishes, floors and my body.  Seriously, its magical.  I even dilute it 2 to 1 with water.  I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this soap! Cleans sticky substances right off, glue, syrup, resins. Gone! Smell is great too, Eucalyptus is pleasant and the after smell is very nice too. I found myself smelling my arms and hands because I enjoyed the aroma. Great soap.</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Super concentrated.</li>
            <li> Great to put in the bath when the kids are congested.</li>
            <li> Wonderful Eucalyptus aroma combined with a great cleansing soap! I sometimes use it as a bubble bath too!</li>
            <li> i love dr bronners soaps mainly because they&#x27;re vegan. while this one isn&#x27;t exactly my favorite as far as smell goes, orange eucalyptus/citrus (?) is the best, it still does any job you use it for. i will always use this for bathing and washing my hair. i love the size and definitely get my moneys worth with the two package deal.</li>
            <li> I switched to this soap after reading rave reviews. I used this for body and face. Although one part of my body itched a little, I ignored it. After about 2 months, I noticed that my face had a LOT of blemishes and it would turn dark even with few minutes of gentle sun exposure. I knew something was up and stopped using this. Later I read articles about strong alkaline soaps destroying the top acid mantle of our skin. So I googled to find ph value of this soap and sure enough, it was well over 9. I also bought my own ph testing strips to confirm it. Even after dilutin</li>
            <li> Bought it and used it for my Yorkie who always seemed to be itchy (no fleas though - just dandruff).  Immediately upon the first use, he stopped scratching so much and slept through the night.  He hasn&#x27;t had an issue since I began using this product.  Also interesting to note, I&#x27;ve used many shampoos on pets and people throughout the years, but this stuff rinses out cleanly without residue.  It&#x27;s a fantastic product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this soap for a few years and the eucalyptus is my favorite. It gives a soothing and relaxing aroma in the shower and feel rejuvenated each time.</li>
            <li> Love this soap, so does my husband. It is all we use, local store always runs out so bought a big supply from Amazon!</li>
            <li> I use this as a shower soap. Bar soaps could be better, and I prefer liquids. My skin is soft, and I&#x27;m very clean. The bathroom smells good too. I added it to my wash cloth to freshen it; maybe, I should try this as a laundry soap as well. I&#x27;ve yet to try it as a general purpose household cleaner, but I think it will work well.</li>
