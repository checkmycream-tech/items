            <li>LOVE IT, WILL PURCHASE AGAIN!!!!</li>
            <li>Its excellent for those with fine hair, or even those who dont want chemicals in their hair!</li>
            <li>This is a good shampoo.  </li>
            <li>THANK YOU SO MUCH RENPURE!!!!!</li>
            <li>and I stopped a lady and raved about how amazing this product was.</li>
            <li>My hair has liked it a lot</li>
            <li>They should honestly pay me because I have been telling everyone to buy this</li>
            <li>All of their stuff smells good in my pinon, but i love coconut</li>
            <li>and I liked the ingredients.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m working on it and can honestly say that my hair is in better health along with the scalp.</li>
            <li>To top it off, no it doesn&#x27;t smell amazing.</li>
            <li>Honestly, Tresemme or Pantene are better than this.</li>
            <li>The keratin version smells more like coconut, this just smells like soap</li>
            <li>but I am SO pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>I couldnt stop touching my hair on my off day from work.</li>
            <li>went in the shamppo isle to stockpile some more in HEB</li>
            <li>, It cleans just as well and has a more luxurious feel in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>Its richer and coats my hair better.</li>
            <li>I love their products.</li>
            <li>I love the scent too</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll stick with another brand of coconut shampoo that works better.</li>
            <li>I do not expect all coconut items to work for me because of my immune problems which reject many things that are not supposed to be a problem.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m enjoying this</li>
            <li>make me feel better.</li>
            <li>I love Repure products except this one just doesn&#x27;t match up.</li>
            <li>It feels super healthy!</li>
            <li>My hair looked flippin gorgeous the first time i used this.</li>
            <li>Smells so good and cleans very well.</li>
            <li>The coconut cream makes my hair so soft, and the smell is amazing!</li>
            <li>I tried this because RenPure is organic and wow.. did my hair get healthy, soft, shiny.. and best of all it stopped falling out.</li>
            <li>Huge fan of this line.</li>
            <li>I truly do not understand when companies use the word coconut as their primary name and description of items that do not have anything</li>
            <li>If you used coconut as an ingredient but the primary scent is lillies or roses.or.cinnamon or jet fuel or vanilla, PLEASE ADD IN UNDERSTANDABLE TERMS...</li>
            <li>lightly.or strongly,it&#x27;s the primary smell.</li>
            <li>my hair feels moisturized and natural and the smell is good.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair smelling so good, soft and light.</li>
            <li>I have noticed a significant reduction in my hair breakage.</li>
            <li>I greatly miss those $12 I spent on the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>This shampoo smells pretty good, and it doesn&#x27;t smell anything like the overpowering coconut fragrances that most other coconut-based shampoos have.</li>
            <li>It could Give me the most gorgeous 20 year old persons hair and make me look 10 years younger</li>
            <li>First off let me say that I am so excited to have this in my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like it because it is free of sulfates and seems gentle on my color treated hair.</li>
            <li>and I had to use twice as much as I normally do just to clean my hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure of the exact hair type of those with &#x27;fine&#x27; hair who reviewed this stuff as amazing, because it&#x27;s not.</li>
            <li>but I like the standard conditioner better</li>
            <li>so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I cannot get over how amazing the smell of this shampoo/conditioner is, and it stays with you throughout the day unlike other coconut shampoo/conditioner ive used.  </li>
            <li>It works good enough on my thick transitioning hair, but i definitely have to follow it up with a good moisturizing conditioner to add more softness and &amp;quot;slip&amp;quot;, as this shampoo doesn&#x27;t provide enough of it for my hair after i rinse it out.</li>
            <li>and I certainly won&#x27;t be purchasing again.  </li>
            <li>It does not really smell like coconut but does smell very soft and nice.</li>
            <li>but I really almost don&#x27;t need it anymore.</li>
            <li>I dont itch as much either.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very sudsy, and cleans my hair well.  </li>
            <li>It does not lather very well</li>
            <li>and I love to be as natural as possible and appreciate companies who do too,</li>
            <li>Very nice &amp; healthy too, nothing bad in this product.  </li>
            <li>Having shoulder-length thick curly hair like straw, i shampoo my hair every other day at best.</li>
            <li>The scalp will feel clean, without the harsh sulfates and parabens that most standard shampoos have.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it, I will be sticking to this shampoo from here on out.</li>
            <li>I love that it is free of harsh chemicals and doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair, or make it oily.</li>
            <li>and the conditioner dried the hair more than the shampoo??</li>
            <li>After the first wash my hair was bouncy, had volume and did not dry up my scalp or hair.</li>
            <li>The full bottle of shampoo and conditioner sit in our shower, untouched after two attempts and I long to find that receipt to take these jokes back.</li>
            <li>Apparently I am just really sensitive to chemicals.</li>
            <li>I have fine, thin, mostly straight hair that tends to get oily scalp after about 24-36 hours.</li>
            <li>I actually did not need to follow up with conditioner because this left my hair very manageable.  </li>
            <li>My hair is fine, but thick</li>
            <li>Very heavy on my hair and doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel clean.</li>
            <li>Definitely not a scent a young woman like myself would like.</li>
            <li>I am sensitive to smells and there are only a handful I can use and</li>
            <li>had such thin, lifeless, dull looking hair with high end shampoo and conditioner, and it made my  hair fall out more!</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Smells like when grandpa wears too much cologne :/</li>
            <li> It left my hair dry as tree bark and tangled beyond belief.</li>
            <li> It does smell good, I&#x27;ll give it that, but other than that, a bad product.</li>
            <li> My hair was so dry and brittle</li>
            <li> It has a very thick and creamy consistency and forms a gentle foam once you rub it into the hair.</li>
            <li> remotely coconut like.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I wash it every other day.</li>
            <li> This product smells really bad and really strong in the bottle and on the hair.</li>
            <li> But...if it has nothing remotely COCONUT it makes me mad because it is.misleading at best and a flat out lie at worst.</li>
            <li> Plus not having sulfates and harsh chemicals</li>
            <li> There would be a slight variation on the smell, but in my opinion, it&#x27;s divine!</li>
            <li> I noticed breakage after a while because I got lazy and didnt always apply conditioner or take my vitamins.</li>
            <li> So igiving this a shot, it says it coats the strands, and that usually means it will protect against breakage.</li>
            <li> As of late I have just been cleansing with the conditioner.</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, the shampoo left my hair feeling greasy and dirty</li>
            <li> But this product dried out my hair worse than generic shampoos :(</li>
            <li> Not very impressive.</li>
            <li> Not happy.</li>
            <li> so bad</li>
            <li> so disappointed.</li>
            <li> My husband tried them too and hated them.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this product and ended up returning it.</li>
            <li> This is the worst shampoo and conditioner I have ever used.</li>
            <li> It is so disgustingly awful</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Very nice &amp; healthy too, nothing bad in this product.  My hair has liked it a lot</li>
            <li> Not very impressive. The keratin version smells more like coconut, this just smells like soap and I find it drying.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair oily and head flaky. Not happy.</li>
            <li> First off let me say that I am so excited to have this in my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I picked this up on a whim when i was in target and saw this in the clearance section so i can&#x27;t attest to shipping but I am SO pleased with this product. If i could hug and kiss the Redmond family I would.&lt;br /&gt;I had such thin, lifeless, dull looking hair with high end shampoo and conditioner, and it made my  hair fall out more! Apparently I am just really sensitive to chemicals. That and i did a similar medicine to chemo.&lt;br /&gt;I did the no-poo thing for about a two years and it helped with the hairloss.  I noticed breakage after a while because I got lazy and didnt always apply conditioner or take my vitamins. So igiving this a shot, it says it coats the strands, and that usually means it will protect against breakage. I will update after a while of using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot get over how amazing the smell of this shampoo/conditioner is, and it stays with you throughout the day unlike other coconut shampoo/conditioner ive used.  I love that it is free of harsh chemicals and doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair, or make it oily. My hair looked flippin gorgeous the first time i used this. It was shiny from root to end and so silky. I couldnt stop touching my hair on my off day from work. C:My boyfriend even noticed how silky it was and complimented my hair when he saw me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went in the shamppo isle to stockpile some more in HEB and I stopped a lady and raved about how amazing this product was. They should honestly pay me because I have been telling everyone to buy this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor and get some. All of their stuff smells good in my pinon, but i love coconut the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upstate: alright y&#x27;all its been a while since using their products. I do like the shampoo but I really almost don&#x27;t need it anymore. As of late I have just been cleansing with the conditioner. I bought the cleansing conditioner as well but I like the standard conditioner better, It cleans just as well and has a more luxurious feel in my opinion.  Its richer and coats my hair better. If I want to remove product build up I use this shampoo.  I love their products. I have noticed a significant reduction in my hair breakage. I am going through stress so hair loss is still happening but I&#x27;m working on it and can honestly say that my hair is in better health along with the scalp. I dont itch as much either. Coconut oil is wondrous.</li>
            <li> Repaired my hair after Pantene made it all fall out. I came across this product line after CLUMPS of my hair began falling out. Doctors, hairdressers, tests.. couldnt figure out why.  I tried this because RenPure is organic and wow.. did my hair get healthy, soft, shiny.. and best of all it stopped falling out. I love the scent too</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure of the exact hair type of those with &#x27;fine&#x27; hair who reviewed this stuff as amazing, because it&#x27;s not. I greatly miss those $12 I spent on the shampoo and conditioner. My hair is fine, but thick and I love to be as natural as possible and appreciate companies who do too, but  I worried my hair would be ruined forever after using this. My hair was so dry and brittle (I assumed coconut cream&#x3D;moisturizer? Yeah no) and the conditioner dried the hair more than the shampoo?? It left my scalp feeling like there was buildup and greasy and the rest like straw. To top it off, no it doesn&#x27;t smell amazing. At least if you were hoping for a distinct coconut smell. The full bottle of shampoo and conditioner sit in our shower, untouched after two attempts and I long to find that receipt to take these jokes back. I gave 1 star for their sneaky eye-catching packaging that gets you. P.S My husband tried them too and hated them.</li>
            <li> I like it because it is free of sulfates and seems gentle on my color treated hair.</li>
            <li> even with the conditioner my hair felt like straw.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  It&#x27;s very sudsy, and cleans my hair well.  The smell makes me want to eat it.  For those who are saying it doesn&#x27;t smell like coconut, well, it&#x27;s Coconut Cream.  There would be a slight variation on the smell, but in my opinion, it&#x27;s divine!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll give it two stars becasue I like the ingredients list and I like the sent.  HOWEVER, the shampoo left my hair feeling greasy and dirty so I won&#x27;t be finishing the product and I certainly won&#x27;t be purchasing again.  I&#x27;ll stick with another brand of coconut shampoo that works better.</li>
            <li> I just bought this shampoo from Target. I like that it is family owned company and I liked the ingredients. I have fine, thin, mostly straight hair that tends to get oily scalp after about 24-36 hours. I wash it every other day. This shampoo is awesome... my hair feels moisturized and natural and the smell is good. It feels super healthy!</li>
            <li> This shampoo smells pretty good, and it doesn&#x27;t smell anything like the overpowering coconut fragrances that most other coconut-based shampoos have. It has a very thick and creamy consistency and forms a gentle foam once you rub it into the hair. The scalp will feel clean, without the harsh sulfates and parabens that most standard shampoos have. It works good enough on my thick transitioning hair, but i definitely have to follow it up with a good moisturizing conditioner to add more softness and &amp;quot;slip&amp;quot;, as this shampoo doesn&#x27;t provide enough of it for my hair after i rinse it out.</li>
            <li> This is the worst shampoo and conditioner I have ever used. Honestly, Tresemme or Pantene are better than this. It left my hair dry as tree bark and tangled beyond belief. It does smell good, I&#x27;ll give it that, but other than that, a bad product. It does not lather very well and I had to use twice as much as I normally do just to clean my hair. Very disappointed in this product and ended up returning it.</li>
            <li> Smells like when grandpa wears too much cologne :/ Definitely not a scent a young woman like myself would like.</li>
            <li> The smell is horrendous, nauseating,super strong,like a bouquet of Chemicals including every smell EXCEPT COCONUT. I truly do not understand when companies use the word coconut as their primary name and description of items that do not have anything remotely coconut like. If you used coconut as an ingredient but the primary scent is lillies or roses.or.cinnamon or jet fuel or vanilla, PLEASE ADD IN UNDERSTANDABLE TERMS...&amp;#34;vibrant scent of jet fuel and roses&amp;#34; or whatever it is. Coconut cream means it smells like coconut,lightly.or strongly,it&#x27;s the primary smell. My entire box of items ordered reeked of chemicals so bad I thought it spilled. It was in a sealed bag and unopened. It is so disgustingly awful I cannot even try it once. It could Give me the most gorgeous 20 year old persons hair and make me look 10 years younger and though I might consider it longer, it would still end up in the trash outside to get it out of my house. What on earth is this scented with? I am sensitive to smells and there are only a handful I can use and coconut is one of them. I do not expect all coconut items to work for me because of my immune problems which reject many things that are not supposed to be a problem. But...if it has nothing remotely COCONUT it makes me mad because it is.misleading at best and a flat out lie at worst.</li>
            <li> Huge fan of this line. The coconut cream makes my hair so soft, and the smell is amazing! I&#x27;m enjoying this</li>
            <li> I purchased it from a store. I will use it from now on.  I don&#x27;t even need conditioner. Leaves my hair smelling so good, soft and light. Plus not having sulfates and harsh chemicals make me feel better.</li>
            <li> I love Repure products except this one just doesn&#x27;t match up. Very heavy on my hair and doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel clean.</li>
            <li> After the first wash my hair was bouncy, had volume and did not dry up my scalp or hair. Its excellent for those with fine hair, or even those who dont want chemicals in their hair! LOVE IT, WILL PURCHASE AGAIN!!!! THANK YOU SO MUCH RENPURE!!!!!</li>
            <li> Smells so good and cleans very well.</li>
            <li> This product smells really bad and really strong in the bottle and on the hair. I returned it.</li>
            <li> just after one use my hair feels different. so soft and smooth. i bought this from a local grocery store but i just had to place a review about it. I highly recommend it, I will be sticking to this shampoo from here on out.</li>
            <li> This is a good shampoo.  I bought the conditioner locally and did not care for that.  I actually did not need to follow up with conditioner because this left my hair very manageable.  It does not really smell like coconut but does smell very soft and nice.</li>
            <li> Having shoulder-length thick curly hair like straw, i shampoo my hair every other day at best. But this product dried out my hair worse than generic shampoos :( so disappointed.</li>
