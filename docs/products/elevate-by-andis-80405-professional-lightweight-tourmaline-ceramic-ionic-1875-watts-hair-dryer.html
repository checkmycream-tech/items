            <li>this is really a superb product at a great price. :)</li>
            <li>Product sparked fire when turned on before first use!!!!!</li>
            <li>This dryer is amazing!</li>
            <li>Since when did you notice how good the hair dryer in your hotel was?  </li>
            <li>Time has proven this is a good product.  </li>
            <li>a good price as well.</li>
            <li>so I can get by until a good one arrives.</li>
            <li>Good for the price.</li>
            <li>Seems to have a good air flow and is lightweight.</li>
            <li>The hairdryer was good while it lasted but has now burnt out.</li>
            <li>this item doesnt do a good job</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll compromise and offer two stars and wish you good luck if you decide to purchase this hair dryer.</li>
            <li>it is a good product just that the attachments does stay on</li>
            <li>My daughter loved it also.  </li>
            <li>and I was very satisfied with it while it was working.  </li>
            <li>All and all, I am still very satisfied with my hair, the blow dryer, and the price.</li>
            <li>product received in good time and we liked it because it was requested by me to give away and use</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>It has a good air pressure and it&#x27;s very very light.</li>
            <li>This hair dryer is amazing.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a comparable replacement without spending that kind of money again.  </li>
            <li>It is lighter weight which I like, and the controls (High/Low/Cold Shot) where nicely placed.  </li>
            <li>Nice blowdryer and lightweight.  </li>
            <li>This one seemed ok on price and the reviews looked good.</li>
            <li>This was just the kind of hair dryer</li>
            <li>My older daughter always researches the best product to buy.</li>
            <li>The only good thing was Amazon was great with the return process!</li>
            <li>I have been using it for two months and the result is quick and great.</li>
            <li>I have a cheap ConAir that I keep on hand for when my good dryers break</li>
            <li>I first experienced this hairdryer when I was in cosmetology school (this is the dryers that came in our kits)  </li>
            <li>Very light weight.</li>
            <li>This product was as described and very light weight.</li>
            <li>I have had it for about 6 months and love it.</li>
            <li>I researched many sites and brands before I purchased this hair dryer.</li>
            <li>Glad that it adds shine to my hair</li>
            <li>I recently stayed at the Buckhead Ritz-Carlton and the most impressive thing</li>
            <li>Love , love it</li>
            <li>love the attachments  for getting</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m not even sure I&#x27;m doing it \\&quot;correctly\\&quot;).</li>
            <li>My girlfriend seems to love it.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love this dryer and its attachments.  </li>
            <li>but I wish that the attachments were able to lock on way better than they do.</li>
            <li>The heat on this blow drier is ok, i say it could try to be a bit hotter</li>
            <li>Wish it had more than 2 settings.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had the problems that many mentioned.</li>
            <li>, the fact that it lasted barely more than one year makes me want to give it zero stars.  </li>
            <li>It was OK while it worked.  </li>
            <li>(which probably caused more frizz).</li>
            <li>My hair looks like 500 percent better using this hair dryer.</li>
            <li>This is a great hair dryer and would highly recommend it!  </li>
            <li>replacement dryer they sent didn&#x27;t fare much better.</li>
            <li>But for its price it&#x27;s lovely.</li>
            <li>Love this hair dryer -</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and light, which is helpful.  </li>
            <li>And it does a great job of drying fast.</li>
            <li>My hair was more straighter than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>I  also love the comb attachment.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a great dryer, quick, clean and to the point.</li>
            <li>I love this dryer.</li>
            <li>I love this dryer.</li>
            <li>Love them both.</li>
            <li>I love this blow dryer.</li>
            <li>May not be able to replace eventually.</li>
            <li>Nice product - two speeds, 3 heats plus a cool button.</li>
            <li>: I really like it, love the color, and I thought it was a good value for the price.</li>
            <li>This is a great dryer for me because I would have to consciously TRY to overdry my hair.</li>
            <li>the comb attachment came with the dryer it would fit securely!</li>
            <li>is easy to change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Also I think if you would happen to break some of the teeth on the hair attachment you could easily retrofit it with another slip on attachment.  </li>
            <li>However, tried to order a replacement pick (pick teeth break easily) and found Andis has discontinued this item so had to go online to find another pick.  </li>
            <li>I liked this dryer at first, but within six months it stopped working.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had the blow dryer for about a month and it has worked just fine for me.</li>
            <li>I thought this would be fine for work</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad it arrived quickly</li>
            <li>The air comes out nice and strong and it gets the job done fast.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent (and pretty) hairdryer without the bulk or weight of most of the other dryers I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li>So far, this is well worth it and a great price.</li>
            <li>Yes, it&#x27;s light weight</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light weight but gets the job done.</li>
            <li>This may be important for people with muscle/nerve/arthritic issues and should be considered for this reason.</li>
            <li>This is such as great blow dryer...</li>
            <li>but it was no longer available.  </li>
            <li>It is perfect for everyday use and travel.  </li>
            <li>I liked it so much</li>
            <li>It has no temperature control and the attachments don&#x27;t fit at all.</li>
            <li>Fantastic Buy.</li>
            <li>Be prepared for a jumbo jet sound.  </li>
            <li>I stay quite frequently at the Hyatt Lodge in Oak Brook, IL, and I&#x27;ve always just loved their in-room hair dryers ([[ASIN:</li>
            <li>I love how hot it gets .</li>
            <li>Did my research first, and exspected to spend much more.</li>
            <li>and it was worth the buy again!  </li>
            <li>It works pretty good is easy to hold and not heavy like some of those out there.</li>
            <li>Quick and so light.</li>
            <li>There is no way to hold this dryer while using the comb attachment that does not cause you to either toggle the switch or press the cool shot.  </li>
            <li>When blow drying on \\&quot;high\\&quot;, my hand kept hitting the cool shot switch.</li>
            <li>It is lightweight, and I like the settings, and the cool shot button.  </li>
            <li>It is light and powerful.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good dryer when it works properly.</li>
            <li>But if you&#x27;re looking for a solid point-and-dry-blow dryer this is a good pick.</li>
            <li>My only complain is that i thought it was &amp;#34;red&amp;#34;; however, it was a gift for my daughter, who loved &amp;#34;black&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly, was a beautiful red, light as a feather and, on high, dries hair super-quickly.  </li>
            <li>Other than that its a great blow dryer.</li>
            <li>So good that I ordered the flat iron too!  </li>
            <li>This is a wonderful Blow dryer, in fact I have several family members and friends already actually where it was purchase.  </li>
            <li>Dries my hair quickly and does not make a lot of noise.</li>
            <li>Love the product and would highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>HAIR WAS DRY WITH IN 5MINUTES, THE PRICE WAS ALSO GOOD</li>
            <li>The motor alternated from high speed to low speed again and again on its own without touching the speed control on the dryer.</li>
            <li>the comb attachment is pretty flimsy and will have to be replaced as the teeth in the comb breaks pretty easily.</li>
            <li>This one allows me to blowdry my hair straight (great attachments included) and leaves it feeling soft, silky and completely unfrizzy!  </li>
            <li>: very light weight, comfortable handle, nice l-o-n-g cord, dries my hair really fast - definitely faster than my old dryer.</li>
            <li>A quiet hairdryer is the most important quality for me, so now I am off to find one...</li>
            <li>Discovered the Andis brand while staying in a Marriott recently and really liked that one.  </li>
            <li>My main issue with this blow dryer is that the attachments slide off easily.</li>
            <li>I rarely write reviews on products.  </li>
            <li>This item isn&#x27;t worth recommending.</li>
            <li>I was thrilled with this low cost, lightweight and well performing dryer.  </li>
            <li>it drys my hair so fast that after a good 7 years of me using it constantly on clients or myself and all throughout school it gave out on me</li>
            <li>and it dries my hair twice as quick, and the heat doesn&#x27;t get burning hot like others I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li>This is my second one as I loved my first one so much,</li>
            <li>The switch slides on the handle, right where my hand is holding the hairdryer</li>
            <li>I can select strong, wild, hot and cool style.</li>
            <li>Her hair is short but this dryer is very easy to use and she loves the comb.</li>
            <li>&quot; the temperature, rather than just have a high and a low setting (plus, of course, the cool shot) would be nice.</li>
            <li>it works fine, i am buying a new one.</li>
            <li>Without using the cool shot button the temperature was VERY hot and damaged my newly chemically processed hair.   </li>
            <li>This hairdryer is by far the lightest I have seen and it has been easy for me to use.  </li>
            <li>My younger daughter liked it so much</li>
            <li>We already had one family member with this dryer and liked it so much we got a second one.</li>
            <li>Works fast, very fast!</li>
            <li>ordered the [[ASIN:B002RC8IMQ Andis Elevate Nano-diamond Ceramic Digital Flat Iron]] to go with it and was not so happy, so see that review to understand why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this blow dryer for a friend and she absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li>However this hair dryer was so HOT on HI that i could not even touch my hair with my hand after blow drying a section using the comb attachment.</li>
            <li>this dryer is WAY TOO HOT.</li>
            <li>And, love that red!</li>
            <li>: it seems that my dryer was defective, which was probably the reason why it got uncomfortably hot.</li>
            <li>I had to get some more from a local craft store</li>
            <li>It gets really hot.</li>
            <li>they tend to not be quiet :)</li>
            <li>The hot setting when it did decide to be hot</li>
            <li>Lightweight, powerful and dries hair fast, though it is quite noisy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Dries my hair really fast!  </li>
            <li>the first thing that i did was blowdry my hair.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what i want it to do.</li>
            <li>Love the blow dryer, especially the pick attachment.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice defusser, nice &amp; small, not long like others</li>
            <li>It has dual voltage so with the appropriate Overseas plug ( the manual says you do not need a voltage converter), it says that it will operate like the high setting and with hot heat when you turn it on the low setting, this will be yet to be determined, but sounds correct.  </li>
            <li>my hair straight heat is not too hot</li>
            <li>so know better than to leave it in one spot for too long which can endanger a pet by burning him/</li>
            <li>I must admit I was initially attracted to the red color but then was impressed with the other attributes.</li>
            <li>The red color is cool!  </li>
            <li>I can only say that once I got used to it, it was easy to use the pik and NOT shut the dryer off.</li>
            <li>Needs more power, I feel like it takes longer to dry my hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is relatively short and fine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty confident that won&#x27;t happen with either of these products and the other haircare products I use.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased so far &amp; will look for other hair care products by this company.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this hair dryer to anyone with curly hair that wants it straight!</li>
            <li>This is a truly fast dryer.</li>
            <li>I need a dryer to help give my hair body and this one does it very well.</li>
            <li>I could not believe how different my hair was--no friz; smooth and silky.  </li>
            <li>It blow dryed straight and with comparable time (8 minutes)</li>
            <li>It straightened out my very coaurse hair .</li>
            <li>What I don&#x27;t like so much</li>
            <li>Very light-weight.  </li>
            <li>It was straight &amp; shiny.  </li>
            <li>Much faster drying time.</li>
            <li>Both have told me repeatedly how much they like it.</li>
            <li>However, I am very unsatisfied with this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>I really like this.</li>
            <li>and I NEED the pick attachment to get my hair shiny straight &amp; &amp;#34;swishy&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>The price was very affordable and it had Tourmaline in it.</li>
            <li>The issue is that the blow drier is not very powerful but for 30 bucks its ok</li>
            <li>so i can easily take my time styling my long hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>No other hotel I&#x27;ve ever stayed in (and I&#x27;ve stayed in quite a few) has a hair dryer that&#x27;s as good, both in terms of performance and in terms of results.    </li>
            <li>I was aware of some of the defects that others had complained about - but so far so good.  </li>
            <li>Where my old ionic dryer took about 15-20 minutes to dry my hair (leaving it extremely frizzy and in need of a great deal of straightening iron time), this dryer works as good as any professional dryer but at 1/5th the cost (or less!).</li>
            <li>I went out of my way to spend a long time looking at different reviews to find the most economical but high quality hair dryer I could find.</li>
            <li>I contacted Amazon.com (excellent and very responsive customer service, BTW), and they had a replacement to me by the very next day, and the \\&quot;uncomfortably hot\\&quot; issue has been resolved.    </li>
            <li>The ELEVATE andis Professional 1875 watts Tourmaline IONIC CERAMIC hair dryer is exactly what i was looking for, with shipping was 40$.</li>
            <li>Wanted to try a new style that required blow drying it straight.</li>
            <li>Plus, the new version is built much cheaper.  </li>
            <li>As stated, by many hair professionals of African American hair studies, that grade 4b or 4c hair is prone to dryness and needs plenty of moisture.</li>
            <li>decent hairdryer.</li>
            <li>but thats not the main issue.</li>
            <li>(big reason I bought this) wasn&#x27;t very hot either</li>
            <li>I chose it because it is a high power hairdryer and has the tool on the end to focus on each section of hair (speeds drying time for me).  </li>
            <li>Set on high</li>
            <li>After 5-6 months of use, the motor would change speed while it was set on high.</li>
            <li>Nice features - extra long 9-10&#x27; rubber cord which will hold up better than the usual 6&#x27; vinyl cords.  </li>
            <li>It is about as loud as any other average hair dryer and the attachments are great for straightening and styling your hair.</li>
            <li>When blow drying on \\&quot;low\\&quot; (which is more of a \\&quot;warm\\&quot;), my hand kept switching to the off position while I blow dried.</li>
            <li>The hotels I normally stay at carry this brand of blow dryer.  </li>
            <li>Another nice feature is the removable lint filter on the back of the unit, should make it easier to keep accumulations of lint and dust out of the dryer (that seems to have been the death of all my previous dryers).     </li>
            <li>: at times it gets uncomfortably hot on the \\&quot;high\\&quot; setting, and another, intermediate setting in between the high and the low or an option to \\&quot;fine-tune\\</li>
            <li>I needed a new hairdryer and she told me this was what I should buy.</li>
            <li>The dryer still looks new, no scratches, no lint in the air intake screen, no kinks in the cord, but is doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>Well, I will be using and have used this dryer to quick dry my hair and afterwards press it.</li>
            <li>Even though I used a heat protectant and a leave-in cream, my hair came out really silky, shinier, and a lot straighter than when I blow dry using two other blow dryers in my house, so I&#x27;m assuming that because this one is a ceramic ionic dryer that it kept in a lot more of the product and moisture in my hair.</li>
            <li>My hair dried quickly and was left soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Did not get hot enough to do anything for my hair.  </li>
            <li>Works better than any I have used in the past.  </li>
            <li>Just LOUD!  </li>
            <li>It is heavy enough to feel substantial but light enough that I am comfortable using it in my non-dominant hand.</li>
            <li>give it 4 stars so far and leave off one because it&#x27;s loud when set on high, but it&#x27;s not bothersome (as with all dryers).</li>
            <li>, my daughter&#x27;s a professional &amp; I don&#x27;t see any difference in her high priced ones, except they are for professional wear &amp; tear!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>When on the &#x27;high&#x27; airflow setting, it constantly shifts to low airflow power after just a couple seconds &amp; then goes back and forth, high to low..increasing my drying time significantly.</li>
            <li>Not true, my hair gets very dry but it is a nice dryer.</li>
            <li>This one looked similar, but was much louder.  </li>
            <li>The old one was billed as being \\&quot;quiet;\\&quot; this one was not.</li>
            <li>no-lye relaxed 4b or 4c hair to natural hair.</li>
            <li>I have natural ethnic hair.</li>
            <li>my towel dryed hair as well as my old CHI Rocket.  </li>
            <li>When I&#x27;m done, my hair&#x27;s soft and looks shiny (shinier, I think, than with the old dryer).</li>
            <li>my old hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read that some people think that it&#x27;s loud</li>
            <li>I split my hair into 6 sections and use a quarter size amount of grapeseed oil in my hair as a natural heat protector.</li>
            <li>I purchased this hair dryer on 18 June 2008, used it only three to four times per week and thought it worked very well.  </li>
            <li>Before it quit, I would have given it four stars (deducting one for being rather loud)</li>
            <li>and I looked professionally done.</li>
            <li>so far this one is performing well.  </li>
            <li>Gave as a gift to my 16 year old she loves it.</li>
            <li>but as it turns out, its rather loud, has no heat settings, and the concentrator falls off.....</li>
            <li>So far it has worked out welll.&lt;br /&gt;Linda</li>
            <li>Could be easily remedied by adding a small &amp;#34;bumper&amp;#34; to each side, like the unit I had before this one.  </li>
            <li>the salon or a friend&#x27;s place would make my hair super frizzy, coarse and dry feeling.  </li>
            <li>It doesnt do what it says, its not as described,my hair is static not very powerful, compare to other hairdryers</li>
            <li>I have thick relaxed hair (in need of a touch up/relaxer) and the comb attachment worked fine for me on my new growth and the length of my hair after detangling.</li>
            <li>After only a few weeks I&#x27;ve noticed that the cord is becoming kinked.</li>
            <li>After a few tries and loved the power and level of dry time, I just had to order it.  </li>
            <li>The CHI hair pick appears tobe of a better quality/more sturdy than the Andis Elevate, so unless your hair is especially thick, than I think the Andis would be adequate for either Caucasian or Ethnic hair textures.  </li>
            <li>The real test will be how long the Andis Elevate dryer lasts.  </li>
            <li>It has the normal noise of a regular dryer.</li>
            <li>It took me three times as long to blow dry my hair where it came out all nice and frizzy (even when using a round brush).</li>
            <li>while my hair did get straight as the day went on my hair got sooooo dry  and brittle.</li>
            <li>The hairdryer blows air very softly if that&#x27;s such a thing.  </li>
            <li>There is no other temperature adjustment on this dryer.</li>
            <li>Then it went back to the normal high setting but every time I tried pointing it towards my hair it would switch back to the low setting with in 5-10 seconds.</li>
            <li>I gave it a 4star only because of 1 small problem after the dryer heats up the comb keeps falling off but a easy fix was to use duct tape</li>
            <li>I have thick, fine, fuzzy flyaway hair and with the pik attachment I have had no problems.</li>
            <li>A little louder than I would like but worth it</li>
            <li>There are only two speeds and settings so you can not have high heat on a low speed and visa versa.</li>
            <li>Only one button that toggles between off high and low.</li>
            <li>I have pretty frizzy hair, I get it chemically straightened, but still, when I blow dry it, it&#x27;s frizzy &amp; I need to flat iron it.  </li>
            <li>So when I needed a new hair dryer, I thought I&#x27;d like to try an Andis for use at home, and when I read the reviews, I decided to try this one because it&#x27;s lightweight, and because - let&#x27;s face it - the red color is really cool (at least IMHO).     </li>
            <li>I like it but the blow dryer takes a great deal longer to dry my hair and I am unable to adjust the setting so it is on the lowest setting making ti take forever to dry my hair ..</li>
            <li>I have natural textured African American hair.</li>
            <li>Having medium long layered fine brunette hair, (in my 50&#x27;s) I was a little skeptical that this would make my hair less  frizzy and dry more quickly, but it actually does.</li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s much quieter than my previous one with all the added power.</li>
            <li>This seems to dry my hair faster than my old one too.</li>
            <li>I have super thick hair</li>
            <li>In the end, the motor would no longer run at high speed and the lower speed it would cycle down to is now the highest speed it operates at.</li>

            <li> this is really a superb product at a great price. :)</li>
            <li> Product sparked fire when turned on before first use!!!!!</li>
            <li> This dryer is amazing!</li>
            <li> Since when did you notice how good the hair dryer in your hotel was?  </li>
            <li> Time has proven this is a good product.  </li>
            <li> a good price as well.</li>
            <li> so I can get by until a good one arrives.</li>
            <li> Good for the price.</li>
            <li> Seems to have a good air flow and is lightweight.</li>
            <li> The hairdryer was good while it lasted but has now burnt out.</li>
            <li> this item doesnt do a good job</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll compromise and offer two stars and wish you good luck if you decide to purchase this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> it is a good product just that the attachments does stay on</li>
            <li> My daughter loved it also.  </li>
            <li> and I was very satisfied with it while it was working.  </li>
            <li> All and all, I am still very satisfied with my hair, the blow dryer, and the price.</li>
            <li> product received in good time and we liked it because it was requested by me to give away and use</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> It has a good air pressure and it&#x27;s very very light.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is amazing.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a comparable replacement without spending that kind of money again.  </li>
            <li> It is lighter weight which I like, and the controls (High/Low/Cold Shot) where nicely placed.  </li>
            <li> Nice blowdryer and lightweight.  </li>
            <li> This one seemed ok on price and the reviews looked good.</li>
            <li> This was just the kind of hair dryer</li>
            <li> My older daughter always researches the best product to buy.</li>
            <li> The only good thing was Amazon was great with the return process!</li>
            <li> I have been using it for two months and the result is quick and great.</li>
            <li> I have a cheap ConAir that I keep on hand for when my good dryers break</li>
            <li> I first experienced this hairdryer when I was in cosmetology school (this is the dryers that came in our kits)  </li>
            <li> Very light weight.</li>
            <li> This product was as described and very light weight.</li>
            <li> I have had it for about 6 months and love it.</li>
            <li> I researched many sites and brands before I purchased this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Glad that it adds shine to my hair</li>
            <li> I recently stayed at the Buckhead Ritz-Carlton and the most impressive thing</li>
            <li> Love , love it</li>
            <li> love the attachments  for getting</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m not even sure I&#x27;m doing it \\&quot;correctly\\&quot;).</li>
            <li> My girlfriend seems to love it.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love this dryer and its attachments.  </li>
            <li> but I wish that the attachments were able to lock on way better than they do.</li>
            <li> The heat on this blow drier is ok, i say it could try to be a bit hotter</li>
            <li> Wish it had more than 2 settings.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had the problems that many mentioned.</li>
            <li> , the fact that it lasted barely more than one year makes me want to give it zero stars.  </li>
            <li> It was OK while it worked.  </li>
            <li> (which probably caused more frizz).</li>
            <li> My hair looks like 500 percent better using this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> This is a great hair dryer and would highly recommend it!  </li>
            <li> replacement dryer they sent didn&#x27;t fare much better.</li>
            <li> But for its price it&#x27;s lovely.</li>
            <li> Love this hair dryer -</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and light, which is helpful.  </li>
            <li> And it does a great job of drying fast.</li>
            <li> My hair was more straighter than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> I  also love the comb attachment.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a great dryer, quick, clean and to the point.</li>
            <li> I love this dryer.</li>
            <li> I love this dryer.</li>
            <li> Love them both.</li>
            <li> I love this blow dryer.</li>
            <li> May not be able to replace eventually.</li>
            <li> Nice product - two speeds, 3 heats plus a cool button.</li>
            <li> : I really like it, love the color, and I thought it was a good value for the price.</li>
            <li> This is a great dryer for me because I would have to consciously TRY to overdry my hair.</li>
            <li> the comb attachment came with the dryer it would fit securely!</li>
            <li> is easy to change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Also I think if you would happen to break some of the teeth on the hair attachment you could easily retrofit it with another slip on attachment.  </li>
            <li> However, tried to order a replacement pick (pick teeth break easily) and found Andis has discontinued this item so had to go online to find another pick.  </li>
            <li> I liked this dryer at first, but within six months it stopped working.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the blow dryer for about a month and it has worked just fine for me.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be fine for work</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad it arrived quickly</li>
            <li> The air comes out nice and strong and it gets the job done fast.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent (and pretty) hairdryer without the bulk or weight of most of the other dryers I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> So far, this is well worth it and a great price.</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s light weight</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light weight but gets the job done.</li>
            <li> This may be important for people with muscle/nerve/arthritic issues and should be considered for this reason.</li>
            <li> This is such as great blow dryer...</li>
            <li> but it was no longer available.  </li>
            <li> It is perfect for everyday use and travel.  </li>
            <li> I liked it so much</li>
            <li> It has no temperature control and the attachments don&#x27;t fit at all.</li>
            <li> Fantastic Buy.</li>
            <li> Be prepared for a jumbo jet sound.  </li>
            <li> I stay quite frequently at the Hyatt Lodge in Oak Brook, IL, and I&#x27;ve always just loved their in-room hair dryers ([[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I love how hot it gets .</li>
            <li> Did my research first, and exspected to spend much more.</li>
            <li> and it was worth the buy again!  </li>
            <li> It works pretty good is easy to hold and not heavy like some of those out there.</li>
            <li> Quick and so light.</li>
            <li> There is no way to hold this dryer while using the comb attachment that does not cause you to either toggle the switch or press the cool shot.  </li>
            <li> When blow drying on \\&quot;high\\&quot;, my hand kept hitting the cool shot switch.</li>
            <li> It is lightweight, and I like the settings, and the cool shot button.  </li>
            <li> It is light and powerful.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good dryer when it works properly.</li>
            <li> But if you&#x27;re looking for a solid point-and-dry-blow dryer this is a good pick.</li>
            <li> My only complain is that i thought it was &amp;#34;red&amp;#34;; however, it was a gift for my daughter, who loved &amp;#34;black&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly, was a beautiful red, light as a feather and, on high, dries hair super-quickly.  </li>
            <li> Other than that its a great blow dryer.</li>
            <li> So good that I ordered the flat iron too!  </li>
            <li> This is a wonderful Blow dryer, in fact I have several family members and friends already actually where it was purchase.  </li>
            <li> Dries my hair quickly and does not make a lot of noise.</li>
            <li> Love the product and would highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> HAIR WAS DRY WITH IN 5MINUTES, THE PRICE WAS ALSO GOOD</li>
            <li> The motor alternated from high speed to low speed again and again on its own without touching the speed control on the dryer.</li>
            <li> the comb attachment is pretty flimsy and will have to be replaced as the teeth in the comb breaks pretty easily.</li>
            <li> This one allows me to blowdry my hair straight (great attachments included) and leaves it feeling soft, silky and completely unfrizzy!  </li>
            <li> : very light weight, comfortable handle, nice l-o-n-g cord, dries my hair really fast - definitely faster than my old dryer.</li>
            <li> A quiet hairdryer is the most important quality for me, so now I am off to find one...</li>
            <li> Discovered the Andis brand while staying in a Marriott recently and really liked that one.  </li>
            <li> My main issue with this blow dryer is that the attachments slide off easily.</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews on products.  </li>
            <li> This item isn&#x27;t worth recommending.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled with this low cost, lightweight and well performing dryer.  </li>
            <li> it drys my hair so fast that after a good 7 years of me using it constantly on clients or myself and all throughout school it gave out on me</li>
            <li> and it dries my hair twice as quick, and the heat doesn&#x27;t get burning hot like others I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> This is my second one as I loved my first one so much,</li>
            <li> The switch slides on the handle, right where my hand is holding the hairdryer</li>
            <li> I can select strong, wild, hot and cool style.</li>
            <li> Her hair is short but this dryer is very easy to use and she loves the comb.</li>
            <li> &quot; the temperature, rather than just have a high and a low setting (plus, of course, the cool shot) would be nice.</li>
            <li> it works fine, i am buying a new one.</li>
            <li> Without using the cool shot button the temperature was VERY hot and damaged my newly chemically processed hair.   </li>
            <li> This hairdryer is by far the lightest I have seen and it has been easy for me to use.  </li>
            <li> My younger daughter liked it so much</li>
            <li> We already had one family member with this dryer and liked it so much we got a second one.</li>
            <li> Works fast, very fast!</li>
            <li> ordered the [[ASIN:B002RC8IMQ Andis Elevate Nano-diamond Ceramic Digital Flat Iron]] to go with it and was not so happy, so see that review to understand why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this blow dryer for a friend and she absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li> However this hair dryer was so HOT on HI that i could not even touch my hair with my hand after blow drying a section using the comb attachment.</li>
            <li> this dryer is WAY TOO HOT.</li>
            <li> And, love that red!</li>
            <li> : it seems that my dryer was defective, which was probably the reason why it got uncomfortably hot.</li>
            <li> I had to get some more from a local craft store</li>
            <li> It gets really hot.</li>
            <li> they tend to not be quiet :)</li>
            <li> The hot setting when it did decide to be hot</li>
            <li> Lightweight, powerful and dries hair fast, though it is quite noisy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Dries my hair really fast!  </li>
            <li> the first thing that i did was blowdry my hair.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what i want it to do.</li>
            <li> Love the blow dryer, especially the pick attachment.  </li>
            <li> It has a nice defusser, nice &amp; small, not long like others</li>
            <li> It has dual voltage so with the appropriate Overseas plug ( the manual says you do not need a voltage converter), it says that it will operate like the high setting and with hot heat when you turn it on the low setting, this will be yet to be determined, but sounds correct.  </li>
            <li> my hair straight heat is not too hot</li>
            <li> so know better than to leave it in one spot for too long which can endanger a pet by burning him/</li>
            <li> I must admit I was initially attracted to the red color but then was impressed with the other attributes.</li>
            <li> The red color is cool!  </li>
            <li> I can only say that once I got used to it, it was easy to use the pik and NOT shut the dryer off.</li>
            <li> Needs more power, I feel like it takes longer to dry my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is relatively short and fine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty confident that won&#x27;t happen with either of these products and the other haircare products I use.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased so far &amp; will look for other hair care products by this company.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this hair dryer to anyone with curly hair that wants it straight!</li>
            <li> This is a truly fast dryer.</li>
            <li> I need a dryer to help give my hair body and this one does it very well.</li>
            <li> I could not believe how different my hair was--no friz; smooth and silky.  </li>
            <li> It blow dryed straight and with comparable time (8 minutes)</li>
            <li> It straightened out my very coaurse hair .</li>
            <li> What I don&#x27;t like so much</li>
            <li> Very light-weight.  </li>
            <li> It was straight &amp; shiny.  </li>
            <li> Much faster drying time.</li>
            <li> Both have told me repeatedly how much they like it.</li>
            <li> However, I am very unsatisfied with this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> I really like this.</li>
            <li> and I NEED the pick attachment to get my hair shiny straight &amp; &amp;#34;swishy&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> The price was very affordable and it had Tourmaline in it.</li>
            <li> The issue is that the blow drier is not very powerful but for 30 bucks its ok</li>
            <li> so i can easily take my time styling my long hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No other hotel I&#x27;ve ever stayed in (and I&#x27;ve stayed in quite a few) has a hair dryer that&#x27;s as good, both in terms of performance and in terms of results.    </li>
            <li> I was aware of some of the defects that others had complained about - but so far so good.  </li>
            <li> Where my old ionic dryer took about 15-20 minutes to dry my hair (leaving it extremely frizzy and in need of a great deal of straightening iron time), this dryer works as good as any professional dryer but at 1/5th the cost (or less!).</li>
            <li> I went out of my way to spend a long time looking at different reviews to find the most economical but high quality hair dryer I could find.</li>
            <li> I contacted Amazon.com (excellent and very responsive customer service, BTW), and they had a replacement to me by the very next day, and the \\&quot;uncomfortably hot\\&quot; issue has been resolved.    </li>
            <li> The ELEVATE andis Professional 1875 watts Tourmaline IONIC CERAMIC hair dryer is exactly what i was looking for, with shipping was 40$.</li>
            <li> Wanted to try a new style that required blow drying it straight.</li>
            <li> Plus, the new version is built much cheaper.  </li>
            <li> As stated, by many hair professionals of African American hair studies, that grade 4b or 4c hair is prone to dryness and needs plenty of moisture.</li>
            <li> decent hairdryer.</li>
            <li> but thats not the main issue.</li>
            <li> (big reason I bought this) wasn&#x27;t very hot either</li>
            <li> I chose it because it is a high power hairdryer and has the tool on the end to focus on each section of hair (speeds drying time for me).  </li>
            <li> Set on high</li>
            <li> After 5-6 months of use, the motor would change speed while it was set on high.</li>
            <li> Nice features - extra long 9-10&#x27; rubber cord which will hold up better than the usual 6&#x27; vinyl cords.  </li>
            <li> It is about as loud as any other average hair dryer and the attachments are great for straightening and styling your hair.</li>
            <li> When blow drying on \\&quot;low\\&quot; (which is more of a \\&quot;warm\\&quot;), my hand kept switching to the off position while I blow dried.</li>
            <li> The hotels I normally stay at carry this brand of blow dryer.  </li>
            <li> Another nice feature is the removable lint filter on the back of the unit, should make it easier to keep accumulations of lint and dust out of the dryer (that seems to have been the death of all my previous dryers).     </li>
            <li> : at times it gets uncomfortably hot on the \\&quot;high\\&quot; setting, and another, intermediate setting in between the high and the low or an option to \\&quot;fine-tune\\</li>
            <li> I needed a new hairdryer and she told me this was what I should buy.</li>
            <li> The dryer still looks new, no scratches, no lint in the air intake screen, no kinks in the cord, but is doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> Well, I will be using and have used this dryer to quick dry my hair and afterwards press it.</li>
            <li> Even though I used a heat protectant and a leave-in cream, my hair came out really silky, shinier, and a lot straighter than when I blow dry using two other blow dryers in my house, so I&#x27;m assuming that because this one is a ceramic ionic dryer that it kept in a lot more of the product and moisture in my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair dried quickly and was left soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> Did not get hot enough to do anything for my hair.  </li>
            <li> Works better than any I have used in the past.  </li>
            <li> Just LOUD!  </li>
            <li> It is heavy enough to feel substantial but light enough that I am comfortable using it in my non-dominant hand.</li>
            <li> give it 4 stars so far and leave off one because it&#x27;s loud when set on high, but it&#x27;s not bothersome (as with all dryers).</li>
            <li> , my daughter&#x27;s a professional &amp; I don&#x27;t see any difference in her high priced ones, except they are for professional wear &amp; tear!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> When on the &#x27;high&#x27; airflow setting, it constantly shifts to low airflow power after just a couple seconds &amp; then goes back and forth, high to low..increasing my drying time significantly.</li>
            <li> Not true, my hair gets very dry but it is a nice dryer.</li>
            <li> This one looked similar, but was much louder.  </li>
            <li> The old one was billed as being \\&quot;quiet;\\&quot; this one was not.</li>
            <li> no-lye relaxed 4b or 4c hair to natural hair.</li>
            <li> I have natural ethnic hair.</li>
            <li> my towel dryed hair as well as my old CHI Rocket.  </li>
            <li> When I&#x27;m done, my hair&#x27;s soft and looks shiny (shinier, I think, than with the old dryer).</li>
            <li> my old hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read that some people think that it&#x27;s loud</li>
            <li> I split my hair into 6 sections and use a quarter size amount of grapeseed oil in my hair as a natural heat protector.</li>
            <li> I purchased this hair dryer on 18 June 2008, used it only three to four times per week and thought it worked very well.  </li>
            <li> Before it quit, I would have given it four stars (deducting one for being rather loud)</li>
            <li> and I looked professionally done.</li>
            <li> so far this one is performing well.  </li>
            <li> Gave as a gift to my 16 year old she loves it.</li>
            <li> but as it turns out, its rather loud, has no heat settings, and the concentrator falls off.....</li>
            <li> So far it has worked out welll.&lt;br /&gt;Linda</li>
            <li> Could be easily remedied by adding a small &amp;#34;bumper&amp;#34; to each side, like the unit I had before this one.  </li>
            <li> the salon or a friend&#x27;s place would make my hair super frizzy, coarse and dry feeling.  </li>
            <li> It doesnt do what it says, its not as described,my hair is static not very powerful, compare to other hairdryers</li>
            <li> I have thick relaxed hair (in need of a touch up/relaxer) and the comb attachment worked fine for me on my new growth and the length of my hair after detangling.</li>
            <li> After only a few weeks I&#x27;ve noticed that the cord is becoming kinked.</li>
            <li> After a few tries and loved the power and level of dry time, I just had to order it.  </li>
            <li> The CHI hair pick appears tobe of a better quality/more sturdy than the Andis Elevate, so unless your hair is especially thick, than I think the Andis would be adequate for either Caucasian or Ethnic hair textures.  </li>
            <li> The real test will be how long the Andis Elevate dryer lasts.  </li>
            <li> It has the normal noise of a regular dryer.</li>
            <li> It took me three times as long to blow dry my hair where it came out all nice and frizzy (even when using a round brush).</li>
            <li> while my hair did get straight as the day went on my hair got sooooo dry  and brittle.</li>
            <li> The hairdryer blows air very softly if that&#x27;s such a thing.  </li>
            <li> There is no other temperature adjustment on this dryer.</li>
            <li> Then it went back to the normal high setting but every time I tried pointing it towards my hair it would switch back to the low setting with in 5-10 seconds.</li>
            <li> I gave it a 4star only because of 1 small problem after the dryer heats up the comb keeps falling off but a easy fix was to use duct tape</li>
            <li> I have thick, fine, fuzzy flyaway hair and with the pik attachment I have had no problems.</li>
            <li> A little louder than I would like but worth it</li>
            <li> There are only two speeds and settings so you can not have high heat on a low speed and visa versa.</li>
            <li> Only one button that toggles between off high and low.</li>
            <li> I have pretty frizzy hair, I get it chemically straightened, but still, when I blow dry it, it&#x27;s frizzy &amp; I need to flat iron it.  </li>
            <li> So when I needed a new hair dryer, I thought I&#x27;d like to try an Andis for use at home, and when I read the reviews, I decided to try this one because it&#x27;s lightweight, and because - let&#x27;s face it - the red color is really cool (at least IMHO).     </li>
            <li> I like it but the blow dryer takes a great deal longer to dry my hair and I am unable to adjust the setting so it is on the lowest setting making ti take forever to dry my hair ..</li>
            <li> I have natural textured African American hair.</li>
            <li> Having medium long layered fine brunette hair, (in my 50&#x27;s) I was a little skeptical that this would make my hair less  frizzy and dry more quickly, but it actually does.</li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s much quieter than my previous one with all the added power.</li>
            <li> This seems to dry my hair faster than my old one too.</li>
            <li> I have super thick hair</li>
            <li> In the end, the motor would no longer run at high speed and the lower speed it would cycle down to is now the highest speed it operates at.</li>
            <li> I have African American/permed shoulder length hair which I flat iron after blow drying.  </li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t cut down my drying time but has left my hair smoother than my old drier.</li>
            <li> I like this dryer a lot, but it slips all over when it&#x27;s rested on a flat surface.  </li>
            <li> I have owned other Andis products in the past and loved them, but after reading other negative reviews and seeing that my problem is identical to others and Andis has not fixed it, AND the dryer is still for sale on here...</li>
            <li> No warning, no apparent problems, nothing to lead me to believe it wouldn&#x27;t last a long time.  </li>
            <li> Also, my hair dried way faster than it normally would.     </li>
            <li> All excited to finally used it, I turn it on and within 10 seconds it goes to this weird sounding low setting.</li>
            <li> If you use a 125 volt when the currency required is 250 you will blow out/or overheat a normal dryer abroad (which I have done in the past), so this dryer has a dual use at 125 and 250 v simply by turning a knob at the bottome of the handle.  </li>
            <li> This hair dryer I purchased in April and 4 months later a part broke or came loose inside the dryer.  </li>
            <li> I usually avoid these high velocity dryers because they typically have a loud, high-pitched whine that can damage hearing.  </li>
            <li> It literally takes 5 minutes to dry my hair, which is down to my shoulder blades and average thickness, and even though I still need to iron out a few frizzies, my hair is so much smoother than with my old dryer!</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s a little louder than my old one, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> I used the comb attachment &amp; after drying my hair it looked like it had already been flat ironed!!!  </li>
            <li> The design is flawed as that the comb does not stay securely when using the dryer.</li>
            <li> i did not leave the dryer in one spot for too long either.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Again, I&#x27;m not a professional</li>
            <li> She has always used cheap wal mart type brand hair dryers and she said it cut her blow drying time in half - she&#x27;s got very thick long hair.</li>
            <li> Had to buy new one locally, cut my loses and tossed.  </li>
            <li> and it takes a long time to dry.  </li>
            <li> The \\&quot;cool\\&quot; shot button only cooled the temperature to what would be considered \\&quot;medium\\&quot; on any other hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> Addendum May 1, 2014:&lt;br /&gt;I am sad to say that I need to rescind my original review.</li>
            <li> so this enables me to dry my hair with one hand.</li>
            <li> I always detangle my hair anyway with a paddle brush before I blow dry it.  </li>
            <li> The comb attachment consistly flies when trying to dry hair.</li>
            <li> When I blow dry my hair</li>
            <li> and it does get moved around or turned off while I&#x27;m trying to dry my hair.</li>
            <li> I  purchased this product because I understood the Ionic feature does not allow your hair to dry out.  </li>
            <li> After my dryer quit working this morning after only purchasing it less than 2 months ago, I came back on here to see what my warranty information might have said as my other dryers had long lives</li>
            <li> Dries my shoulder length THICK hair very fast - almost half the time</li>
            <li> This low quality defective hair dryer was not worth buying.</li>
            <li> I would only add that there was a horrible odor coming from inside it before it finally said goodbye for good to me.  </li>
            <li> I actually wrote down the name and info about the hair dryer and ordered from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Dry time is shorter and it has power!</li>
            <li> Two dryers which both failed in less than a year under light use.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend it to any girl, especially one who has had previous trouble with blowdryers that have made your hair frizzy/dry.  </li>
            <li> Some ppl have complained it&#x27;s loud.</li>
            <li> The nozzle is too wide &amp; the result is frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> I did use a protective hair dress, and my hair was damp not soaking wet.</li>
            <li> I am a guy and only use it a few minutes a day.  </li>
            <li> For those of us who have thick curly hair and actually need to use the comb attachment, you&#x27;ll find yourself constantly having to re-start the dryer because of the high/off/lo switch being pushed.  </li>
            <li> So, I was looking to wash my hair then press it, but my hair takes hours to air dry; though, it appears dried once I towel dry it... it still retains water.</li>
            <li> My problem with previous dryers was my pick attachment always falling off &amp; when it did stay on, it overheated my dryer which slowed my dry time.  </li>
            <li> Well, my hair was dry in half the time &amp; it is lighter than my other dryer, so it didnt kill my shoulder &amp; irritate my arthritis.</li>
            <li> We are Black and she has natural thick and curly hair.</li>
            <li> My hair was dry in 3 minutes and the pick attachment stayed on &amp; tight throughout.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other than that annoyance</li>
            <li> The comb attachment did not pop off once for me despite other reviews.   </li>
            <li> I had a difficult time at first as well.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> This dries my long thick hair in no time flat without frizz or heat damage!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even have to apply a flat iron to my hair no more .</li>
            <li> have fairly long, course, thick hair, that has always taken FOREVER to dry.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s really my only complaint.     </li>
            <li> Not worth $49.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This dryer worked well for about 7 months (used on average 2-3 times a week) before the motor died.</li>
            <li> Of note I did sense a slight oder at the vent site when in use</li>
            <li> It was a close call between a much more expensive dryer and this one, but after reading reviews, I took the less expensive route.  </li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;ve had this hair dryer for less than a year</li>
            <li> This product drys your hair quickly,therefore causing less damage.</li>
            <li> I found this dryer to be sufficiant for my needaa bot a little onn the heavy side.</li>
            <li> Dead.  </li>
            <li> Dampness effects my press iron, if my shafts are not free from vapor;</li>
            <li> her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Addendum 03/15/2012&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed a few people complain about the design of the dryer with regard to the on/off switch and utilizing the pik attachment.</li>
            <li> Dead in under two years.</li>
            <li> Not too bulky or heavy.</li>
            <li> Just like the one they use in my salon, and it costs so much less!  </li>
            <li> Granted I use it for my beard, but I&#x27;ve had none of the problems other reviewers have complained about.</li>
            <li> and I have thin long hair.</li>
            <li> The cord is thin and very long.</li>
            <li> I had hoped it would last longer considering how expensive it was , so</li>
            <li> Plus my hair didn&#x27;t seem as frizzy as usual.</li>
            <li> I bought this product even after reading negative reviews.</li>
            <li> No more tired arms or skimping cost and realizing quality was also lost...</li>
            <li> and i pray i dont suffer any long term effects like having to cut my hair off :-(</li>
            <li> When this dryer kicks the bucket I will not repurchase because it is really annoying to keep sliding the comb attachment back on....</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I wrote Andis with a less-than-happy customer complaint and look forward to their reply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this is NOT good AMAZON!  </li>
            <li> that way was a little painful</li>
            <li> Also, I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m weird or what, but I had to grip it using the space between my thumb and index fingers to avoid that and holding it</li>
            <li> I had another Andis product that failed after 11 months</li>
            <li> so I wouldn&#x27;t have to make it look so crazy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s disappointing when a company requires you to pay for shipping while the product is still under warranty.</li>
            <li> Very scary.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fond of haircare products with argan oil in them for its thermal protection since my stylist tells me my ends aren&#x27;t bad at all; that&#x27;s after she reprimands me for not coming in but</li>
            <li> i hate it</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is awful!  </li>
            <li> I hated this dryer!!!.</li>
            <li> Comb kept coming off, Worst dryer ever.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This hair dryer is awful!  I have super thick hair and it takes a long time to dry.  I chose it because it is a high power hairdryer and has the tool on the end to focus on each section of hair (speeds drying time for me).  When on the &#x27;high&#x27; airflow setting, it constantly shifts to low airflow power after just a couple seconds &amp; then goes back and forth, high to low..increasing my drying time significantly.</li>
            <li> This is a truly fast dryer. It met or exceed my expectations. I have had it for about 6 months and love it.</li>
            <li> I researched many sites and brands before I purchased this hair dryer. I must admit I was initially attracted to the red color but then was impressed with the other attributes. My hair is relatively short and fine. I need a dryer to help give my hair body and this one does it very well. I like the attatchment that can be used as a comb since it can be used with one hand; I recently had elbow surgery so this enables me to dry my hair with one hand. It is heavy enough to feel substantial but light enough that I am comfortable using it in my non-dominant hand.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair &amp; I use the hair dryer to straighten. The nozzle is too wide &amp; the result is frizzy hair. They need to make a narrower nozzle for straightening!</li>
            <li> I received the hair dryer in a prompt time span. I like the dryer having two attachments. It has great settings for hi and lo.  It is lightweight so i can easily take my time styling my long hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with this product. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a similar Andis dryer that I bought 2 years ago that konked out.  This one looked similar, but was much louder.  The old one was billed as being \\&quot;quiet;\\&quot; this one was not. A quiet hairdryer is the most important quality for me, so now I am off to find one...</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re getting this because of the comb attachment, this is not the dryer for you.  For those of us who have thick curly hair and actually need to use the comb attachment, you&#x27;ll find yourself constantly having to re-start the dryer because of the high/off/lo switch being pushed.  There is no way to hold this dryer while using the comb attachment that does not cause you to either toggle the switch or press the cool shot.  Other than that annoyance though, it worked well.</li>
            <li> I liked this dryer at first, but within six months it stopped working.  It had a burning smell inside.  Dead.  I don&#x27;t know about you, but I feel like a blow dryer should last longer than that.  And, who likes getting stuck without one??</li>
            <li> This is very good. I like it. I can select strong, wild, hot and cool style. awesome!</li>
            <li> Purchased this item because I&#x27;m needing to transition from no-lye relaxed 4b or 4c hair to natural hair. As stated, by many hair professionals of African American hair studies, that grade 4b or 4c hair is prone to dryness and needs plenty of moisture. So, I was looking to wash my hair then press it, but my hair takes hours to air dry; though, it appears dried once I towel dry it... it still retains water. Dampness effects my press iron, if my shafts are not free from vapor; therally. Well, I will be using and have used this dryer to quick dry my hair and afterwards press it. Both heat tools that I have now are of tourmaline and ceramic technology...I believe this system is better because they will ensure least harsh heat on my hair shafts. Glad that it adds shine to my hair and I look forward to continuous usage in the future. Yes, it&#x27;s light weight and it&#x27;s filter is easy to change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give it 4 stars so far and leave off one because it&#x27;s loud when set on high, but it&#x27;s not bothersome (as with all dryers).</li>
            <li> I bought this blow dryer for a friend and she absolutely loves it! It&#x27;s light weight but gets the job done. I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Since when did you notice how good the hair dryer in your hotel was?  I recently stayed at the Buckhead Ritz-Carlton and the most impressive thing was the hair dryer.  I could not believe how different my hair was--no friz; smooth and silky.  I actually wrote down the name and info about the hair dryer and ordered from Amazon.  The hair dryer is great.  So good that I ordered the flat iron too!  Great find--I now have the Ritz of hair dryers!</li>
            <li> I have natural ethnic hair. Wanted to try a new style that required blow drying it straight. I got this hair dryer to try it out. I did use a protective hair dress, and my hair was damp not soaking wet. However this hair dryer was so HOT on HI that i could not even touch my hair with my hand after blow drying a section using the comb attachment. i did not leave the dryer in one spot for too long either. just simply combing through my hair. while my hair did get straight as the day went on my hair got sooooo dry  and brittle. i had to spend 2+ hours deep conditining it to get some sort of life and softness back into it. this dryer is WAY TOO HOT. and will burn your hair off. maybe because its \\&quot;professional\\&quot; strength i dont know. but i will not use this dryer ever again!!! and i pray i dont suffer any long term effects like having to cut my hair off :-(</li>
            <li> Perfect blow dryer for the price.  My only issue is the comb falling off sometimes. Other than that its a great blow dryer.</li>
            <li> Great lightweight blow dryer! Set on high and it dries my hair twice as quick, and the heat doesn&#x27;t get burning hot like others I&#x27;ve had. And, love that red!</li>
            <li> My CHI Rocket blow dryer just started to overheat and set off my home smoke alarms so it was time to replace.  I got three years of use out of it, with only using once a week.  I had hoped it would last longer considering how expensive it was , so I was looking for a comparable replacement without spending that kind of money again.  Let me say the CHI Rocket is a great , powerfull, blow dryer and I was very satisfied with it while it was working.  I have African American/permed shoulder length hair which I flat iron after blow drying.  My Andis Elevate arrived today and I used it.  It blow dryed straight and with comparable time (8 minutes) my towel dryed hair as well as my old CHI Rocket.  It is lighter weight which I like, and the controls (High/Low/Cold Shot) where nicely placed.  Sometimes I would inadvertedly change my CHI settings which does not happen with the Andis.  The comb attachment did not pop off once for me despite other reviews.   It has dual voltage so with the appropriate Overseas plug ( the manual says you do not need a voltage converter), it says that it will operate like the high setting and with hot heat when you turn it on the low setting, this will be yet to be determined, but sounds correct.  If you use a 125 volt when the currency required is 250 you will blow out/or overheat a normal dryer abroad (which I have done in the past), so this dryer has a dual use at 125 and 250 v simply by turning a knob at the bottome of the handle.  The real test will be how long the Andis Elevate dryer lasts.  I think this is an excellent price for the features in this dryer.  Of note I did sense a slight oder at the vent site when in use but it wasn&#x27;t anything that lingered in the room nor was the odor transferred to my hair.  Also I think if you would happen to break some of the teeth on the hair attachment you could easily retrofit it with another slip on attachment.  My CHI hair pick attachment only fits the CHI and snaps on.  The CHI hair pick appears tobe of a better quality/more sturdy than the Andis Elevate, so unless your hair is especially thick, than I think the Andis would be adequate for either Caucasian or Ethnic hair textures.  I always detangle my hair anyway with a paddle brush before I blow dry it.  I hope this helps others contemplating what to purchase.</li>
            <li> Time has proven this is a good product.  Would buy another one.</li>
            <li> It was the best purchase I made in a while . It straightened out my very coaurse hair . I love how hot it gets . I don&#x27;t even have to apply a flat iron to my hair no more .</li>
            <li> This blowdryer is absolutely wonderful!! I have never owned a blowdryer before because any of the ones I would sample at home, the salon or a friend&#x27;s place would make my hair super frizzy, coarse and dry feeling.  This one allows me to blowdry my hair straight (great attachments included) and leaves it feeling soft, silky and completely unfrizzy!  I would definitely recommend it to any girl, especially one who has had previous trouble with blowdryers that have made your hair frizzy/dry.  I also haven&#x27;t experienced a deterioration/damage in the quality of my hair as a result of using this.</li>
            <li> I stay quite frequently at the Hyatt Lodge in Oak Brook, IL, and I&#x27;ve always just loved their in-room hair dryers ([[ASIN:B0009XH6TG Andis 80020 Ionic 1875W Ceramic Hair Dryer with Folding Handle and Retractable Cord]]). No other hotel I&#x27;ve ever stayed in (and I&#x27;ve stayed in quite a few) has a hair dryer that&#x27;s as good, both in terms of performance and in terms of results.    So when I needed a new hair dryer, I thought I&#x27;d like to try an Andis for use at home, and when I read the reviews, I decided to try this one because it&#x27;s lightweight, and because - let&#x27;s face it - the red color is really cool (at least IMHO).     What I like: very light weight, comfortable handle, nice l-o-n-g cord, dries my hair really fast - definitely faster than my old dryer. When I&#x27;m done, my hair&#x27;s soft and looks shiny (shinier, I think, than with the old dryer). Another nice feature is the removable lint filter on the back of the unit, should make it easier to keep accumulations of lint and dust out of the dryer (that seems to have been the death of all my previous dryers).     What I don&#x27;t like so much: at times it gets uncomfortably hot on the \\&quot;high\\&quot; setting, and another, intermediate setting in between the high and the low or an option to \\&quot;fine-tune\\&quot; the temperature, rather than just have a high and a low setting (plus, of course, the cool shot) would be nice. That&#x27;s really my only complaint.     Update: it seems that my dryer was defective, which was probably the reason why it got uncomfortably hot. After about a month of use, it simply died on me. I contacted Amazon.com (excellent and very responsive customer service, BTW), and they had a replacement to me by the very next day, and the \\&quot;uncomfortably hot\\&quot; issue has been resolved.    Bottom line: I really like it, love the color, and I thought it was a good value for the price.</li>
            <li> Did my research first, and exspected to spend much more. But guess what, don&#x27;t have 2 now. The ELEVATE andis Professional 1875 watts Tourmaline IONIC CERAMIC hair dryer is exactly what i was looking for, with shipping was 40$. My only warning is it has 3 speeds of heat. I would suggest using a product ,maybe a thermal styling spray, or a serum. You can tell when you hold it ,its not a piece of garbage, and ( I hope )it will last longer than all the cheapos. Love , love it</li>
            <li> Very light-weight.  Dries my shoulder length THICK hair very fast - almost half the time my old hair dryer.  The red color is cool!  Discovered the Andis brand while staying in a Marriott recently and really liked that one.  This is an upgraded version.  I&#x27;ve read that some people think that it&#x27;s loud but I don&#x27;t notice it.  Sounds just like the ones in the salon to me!</li>
            <li> I have thick relaxed hair (in need of a touch up/relaxer) and the comb attachment worked fine for me on my new growth and the length of my hair after detangling. Even though I used a heat protectant and a leave-in cream, my hair came out really silky, shinier, and a lot straighter than when I blow dry using two other blow dryers in my house, so I&#x27;m assuming that because this one is a ceramic ionic dryer that it kept in a lot more of the product and moisture in my hair. Also, my hair dried way faster than it normally would.     The only reason I give this product 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the placement of the setting switches. When blow drying on \\&quot;low\\&quot; (which is more of a \\&quot;warm\\&quot;), my hand kept switching to the off position while I blow dried. When blow drying on \\&quot;high\\&quot;, my hand kept hitting the cool shot switch. Also, I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m weird or what, but I had to grip it using the space between my thumb and index fingers to avoid that and holding it that way was a little painful so I wish the buttons were placed somewhere else. All and all, I am still very satisfied with my hair, the blow dryer, and the price.</li>
            <li> This is the 1st item I&#x27;ve returned to Amazon. I hated this dryer!!!. The \\&quot;cool\\&quot; shot button only cooled the temperature to what would be considered \\&quot;medium\\&quot; on any other hair dryer.  There is no other temperature adjustment on this dryer. Without using the cool shot button the temperature was VERY hot and damaged my newly chemically processed hair.   The only good thing was Amazon was great with the return process!</li>
            <li> I use this blow dryer daily, it works for me, that way I won&#x27;t have to borrow my daughters on. a good price as well.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted it works well  love the attachments  for getting my hair straight heat is not too hot</li>
            <li> I have pretty frizzy hair, I get it chemically straightened, but still, when I blow dry it, it&#x27;s frizzy &amp; I need to flat iron it.  I was AMAZED by this hair dryer!  I used the comb attachment &amp; after drying my hair it looked like it had already been flat ironed!!!  It was straight &amp; shiny.  I would highly recommend this hair dryer to anyone with curly hair that wants it straight!</li>
            <li> This is a great dryer for me because I would have to consciously TRY to overdry my hair. I have a cheap ConAir that I keep on hand for when my good dryers break so I can get by until a good one arrives. This is a good one, and what a difference! I&#x27;m so glad it arrived quickly or my hair would&#x27;ve been toast! I have thick, fine, fuzzy flyaway hair and with the pik attachment I have had no problems. The only problem was on my end. When the unit arrived, I thought the spongy tape material within the concentrators were for packing purposes so removed it. I had to get some more from a local craft store so DO NOT REMOVE THAT TAPE!! My bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, I&#x27;m not a professional but I don&#x27;t want charbroiled hair either. I&#x27;m pretty confident that won&#x27;t happen with either of these products and the other haircare products I use. I&#x27;m fond of haircare products with argan oil in them for its thermal protection since my stylist tells me my ends aren&#x27;t bad at all; that&#x27;s after she reprimands me for not coming in but every 6 to 9 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered the [[ASIN:B002RC8IMQ Andis Elevate Nano-diamond Ceramic Digital Flat Iron]] to go with it and was not so happy, so see that review to understand why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I even used the Elevate on my dog today without issue. Of course it helps that I used to groom dogs so know better than to leave it in one spot for too long which can endanger a pet by burning him/her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Addendum 03/15/2012&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed a few people complain about the design of the dryer with regard to the on/off switch and utilizing the pik attachment. It takes some getting used to in order to hold the dryer and feed your hair through the pik. I had a difficult time at first as well. I can&#x27;t describe the way I do it (I&#x27;m not even sure I&#x27;m doing it \\&quot;correctly\\&quot;). I can only say that once I got used to it, it was easy to use the pik and NOT shut the dryer off.</li>
            <li> It doesnt do what it says, its not as described,my hair is static not very powerful, compare to other hairdryers</li>
            <li> After my dryer quit working this morning after only purchasing it less than 2 months ago, I came back on here to see what my warranty information might have said as my other dryers had long lives and I threw away the box and info when I received it.  I have owned other Andis products in the past and loved them, but after reading other negative reviews and seeing that my problem is identical to others and Andis has not fixed it, AND the dryer is still for sale on here...this is NOT good AMAZON!  As another consumer stated, this dryer should be called a disposable dryer.  I would only add that there was a horrible odor coming from inside it before it finally said goodbye for good to me.  Please pull it Amazon.</li>
            <li> This blow dryer doesn&#x27;t have a cord retieval like ohter Andis dryers do. The cord is thin and very long. For storage after daily use I wrap the cord around the dryer or handle part. After only a few weeks I&#x27;ve noticed that the cord is becoming kinked. It&#x27;s only a matter or time before it&#x27;s shorting out.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend seems to love it. She has always used cheap wal mart type brand hair dryers and she said it cut her blow drying time in half - she&#x27;s got very thick long hair.</li>
            <li> Much faster drying time. Hair looks healthier. Great buy for the price. Love it. Very light weight. A little louder than I would like but worth it</li>
            <li> I purchased this haridryer for one reason- I broke both of my elbows in a fall and needed to have a lightweight dryer to use after the splints came off.  This hairdryer is by far the lightest I have seen and it has been easy for me to use.  This may be important for people with muscle/nerve/arthritic issues and should be considered for this reason. There are only two speeds and settings so you can not have high heat on a low speed and visa versa.</li>
            <li> The comb attachment consistly flies when trying to dry hair. The design is flawed as that the comb does not stay securely when using the dryer. Thought that is the comb attachment came with the dryer it would fit securely!</li>
            <li> I love this dryer and its attachments.  I use the comb with every use and it has never slid or even moved from the position I placed it in.  Good for the price.</li>
            <li> decent hairdryer. It gets really hot. Doesn&#x27;t have separate buttons for air level and heat level. Instead it has one heat setting. Only one button that toggles between off high and low. the comb attachment is pretty flimsy and will have to be replaced as the teeth in the comb breaks pretty easily. I use this on my daughters hair. We are Black and she has natural thick and curly hair.</li>
            <li> I gave it a 4star only because of 1 small problem after the dryer heats up the comb keeps falling off but a easy fix was to use duct tape and now it works perfect for me... I wished the comb attachment had a twist and lock feature so I wouldn&#x27;t have to make it look so crazy.</li>
            <li> My main issue with this blow dryer is that the attachments slide off easily. I have natural textured African American hair. When I blow dry my hair I split my hair into 6 sections and use a quarter size amount of grapeseed oil in my hair as a natural heat protector. I think the dryer is great for the price but I wish that the attachments were able to lock on way better than they do. When this dryer kicks the bucket I will not repurchase because it is really annoying to keep sliding the comb attachment back on....ugh!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy!!! Product sparked fire when turned on before first use!!!!! Very scary. I will be returning this product. And I repeat...Do not buy!!!</li>
            <li> This is a great blow dryer! The air comes out nice and strong and it gets the job done fast.</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly, was a beautiful red, light as a feather and, on high, dries hair super-quickly.  Also, it&#x27;s much quieter than my previous one with all the added power.</li>
            <li> it came on time, I have not use it yet, but feel it will do what I need .  I wanted a comb attachment</li>
            <li> Having medium long layered fine brunette hair, (in my 50&#x27;s) I was a little skeptical that this would make my hair less  frizzy and dry more quickly, but it actually does. This translates to shinier looking hair too. It is lightweight, and I like the settings, and the cool shot button.  No problems with p,a cement.  I am impressed, and would recommend.  It was a close call between a much more expensive dryer and this one, but after reading reviews, I took the less expensive route.  So far, this is well worth it and a great price.</li>
            <li> I just received the hair dryer.  Seems to have a good air flow and is lightweight. I have yet to test it.  However, if you are looking for a quiet dryer this is not different from others. It has the normal noise of a regular dryer.</li>
            <li> Some ppl have complained it&#x27;s loud. It&#x27;s a hair dryer... they tend to not be quiet :) Maybe it&#x27;s a little louder than my old one, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me. This seems to dry my hair faster than my old one too. I like that. Plus my hair didn&#x27;t seem as frizzy as usual.</li>
            <li> The heat on this blow drier is ok, i say it could try to be a bit hotter but thats not the main issue. The issue is that the blow drier is not very powerful but for 30 bucks its ok</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the blow dryer for about a month and it has worked just fine for me. Granted I use it for my beard, but I&#x27;ve had none of the problems other reviewers have complained about.</li>
            <li> The hairdryer was good while it lasted but has now burnt out. Dead in under two years. I bought it for $26.75 two years ago on Amazon Prime and now it seems tripple the price! How is that even possible?</li>
            <li> Did not get hot enough to do anything for my hair.  i returned this product.</li>
            <li> this item doesnt do a good job AT ALL i hate it and i wouldnt recommend anyone buy it !</li>
            <li> Nice blowdryer and lightweight.  Wish it had more than 2 settings. Worked well with curly hair</li>
            <li> Does not  last.  Flew apart in pieces one afternoon while using it.  I am a guy and only use it a few minutes a day.  Plus, the new version is built much cheaper.  Not worth $49.  Never had a fan blade split apart like this dryer.</li>
            <li> My older daughter always researches the best product to buy. I needed a new hairdryer and she told me this was what I should buy. My younger daughter liked it so much I got her one for her birthday and my daughter-in-law also got one for her birthday. Both have told me repeatedly how much they like it.</li>
            <li> I bought this product even after reading negative reviews. I&#x27;ve only used it twice since it was delivered. I haven&#x27;t had the problems that many mentioned. It didn&#x27;t deliver the velocity of air flow I had hoped for and I have thin long hair. It hasn&#x27;t cut down my drying time but has left my hair smoother than my old drier.</li>
            <li> I purchased this hair dryer on 18 June 2008, used it only three to four times per week and thought it worked very well.  My hair dried quickly and was left soft and smooth.  Then only 21 days after the one year warranty expired it quit.  No warning, no apparent problems, nothing to lead me to believe it wouldn&#x27;t last a long time.  It just stopped working and would not start again.  The dryer still looks new, no scratches, no lint in the air intake screen, no kinks in the cord, but is doesn&#x27;t work.  Before it quit, I would have given it four stars (deducting one for being rather loud), the fact that it lasted barely more than one year makes me want to give it zero stars.  I&#x27;ll compromise and offer two stars and wish you good luck if you decide to purchase this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews on products.  However, I am very unsatisfied with this hair dryer.  It was OK while it worked.  However, I&#x27;ve had this hair dryer for less than a year and it just stopped working.  Not only did it stop working, but it shot sparks out when it died.</li>
            <li> it is a good product just that the attachments does stay on you would have to hold it sometimes when using.</li>
            <li> I went out of my way to spend a long time looking at different reviews to find the most economical but high quality hair dryer I could find. This one seemed ok on price and the reviews looked good. All excited to finally used it, I turn it on and within 10 seconds it goes to this weird sounding low setting. I thought I must have switched it to low on accident until I double checked and I didn&#x27;t. Then it went back to the normal high setting but every time I tried pointing it towards my hair it would switch back to the low setting with in 5-10 seconds. It took me three times as long to blow dry my hair where it came out all nice and frizzy (even when using a round brush). The hot setting when it did decide to be hot (big reason I bought this) wasn&#x27;t very hot either (which probably caused more frizz). This low quality defective hair dryer was not worth buying.</li>
            <li> This item broke in the second time I used. I am totally returning it.</li>
            <li> I have never rated this product by given it a 5 star; and I have never wrote a review for this product!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,&lt;br /&gt;Ms. Marlene Farrell-Trent</li>
            <li> My hair looks like 500 percent better using this hair dryer. I have blowed dryed my hair strait and I looked professionally done.</li>
            <li> The hairdryer blows air very softly if that&#x27;s such a thing.  Needs more power, I feel like it takes longer to dry my hair.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is amazing.  Just like the one they use in my salon, and it costs so much less!  This is my second one as I loved my first one so much, when it died I bought the same thing!</li>
            <li> This is such as great blow dryer... I have been using it for two months and the result is quick and great.</li>
            <li> This is a great hair dryer and would highly recommend it!  We already had one family member with this dryer and liked it so much we got a second one.</li>
            <li> It is light and powerful. I love it!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good dryer when it works properly. Lightweight, powerful and dries hair fast, though it is quite noisy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This dryer worked well for about 7 months (used on average 2-3 times a week) before the motor died. I returned it to Andis while it was still covered by their warranty and was dismayed to find out I had to pay for shipping. It&#x27;s disappointing when a company requires you to pay for shipping while the product is still under warranty. They sold a faulty product, therefore, they should take responsibility for the shipping cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The replacement dryer they sent didn&#x27;t fare much better. After 5-6 months of use, the motor would change speed while it was set on high. The motor alternated from high speed to low speed again and again on its own without touching the speed control on the dryer. In the end, the motor would no longer run at high speed and the lower speed it would cycle down to is now the highest speed it operates at. I&#x27;m assuming that the replacement they sent was refurbished as it operated so poorly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I understand that some lemons slip through the manufacturing process but to receive two lemons in a row isn&#x27;t acceptable. Two dryers which both failed in less than a year under light use. This item isn&#x27;t worth recommending.</li>
            <li> I had another Andis product that failed after 11 months but it was no longer available.  Returned it to Andis and they replaced it with this model.  Nice features - extra long 9-10&#x27; rubber cord which will hold up better than the usual 6&#x27; vinyl cords.  I usually avoid these high velocity dryers because they typically have a loud, high-pitched whine that can damage hearing.  This one does not. Very low pitch, acceptable noise level. Nice product - two speeds, 3 heats plus a cool button.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled with this low cost, lightweight and well performing dryer.  It is perfect for everyday use and travel.  However, it stopped working after only two months of moderate use.  \\&quot;Disposable\\&quot; should be added to the product description.</li>
            <li> Addendum May 1, 2014:&lt;br /&gt;I am sad to say that I need to rescind my original review. After submitting a 5-Star review, I now am changing it to 1-Star because both of the hairdryers purchased have sparked and stopped working - mine just under 6 months and my mother&#x27;s at 3 months. Needless to say, I wrote Andis with a less-than-happy customer complaint and look forward to their reply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original Review:&lt;br /&gt;Let me start this off with... I liked it so much I convinced my mother and grandmother to purchase it too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This dryer has the bells and whistles without the weight. This is an excellent (and pretty) hairdryer without the bulk or weight of most of the other dryers I&#x27;ve owned. No more tired arms or skimping cost and realizing quality was also lost... this is really a superb product at a great price. :)</li>
            <li> This is by no means the best blow dryer on the market. But for its price it&#x27;s lovely. It has a good air pressure and it&#x27;s very very light. It has no temperature control and the attachments don&#x27;t fit at all. But if you&#x27;re looking for a solid point-and-dry-blow dryer this is a good pick.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS VERY GOOD, I ALSO USE IT FOR STRAIGHTEN MY HAIR BECAUSE IT CAME WITH ATTACHMENTS.&lt;br /&gt;MY HAIR WAS DRY WITH IN 5MINUTES, THE PRICE WAS ALSO GOOD AND IT CAME WITH A ONE YEAR WARRANTY.</li>
            <li> Fantastic Buy. No problems. Great purchase!</li>
            <li> This product drys your hair quickly,therefore causing less damage. It is about as loud as any other average hair dryer and the attachments are great for straightening and styling your hair.</li>
            <li> product received in good time and we liked it because it was requested by me to give away and use</li>
            <li> This product was as described and very light weight. Not too bulky or heavy. This was just the kind of hair dryer I&#x27;ve been looking for.</li>
            <li> I like it but the blow dryer takes a great deal longer to dry my hair and I am unable to adjust the setting so it is on the lowest setting making ti take forever to dry my hair ..</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful Blow dryer, in fact I have several family members and friends already actually where it was purchase.  My only complain is that i thought it was &amp;#34;red&amp;#34;; however, it was a gift for my daughter, who loved &amp;#34;black&amp;#34;. Wonderful product!</li>
            <li> Works fast, very fast! It&#x27;s the fastest dryer I&#x27;ve ever had. It doesn&#x27;t seem to overheat the hair and cause fizziness either.</li>
            <li> I like this hairdryer and it works well, but I should have paid attention to one of the reviews that said the control switch is in a bd place. The switch slides on the handle, right where my hand is holding the hairdryer and it does get moved around or turned off while I&#x27;m trying to dry my hair. If I had to choose all over again, I would probably buy a different one whose switch is in a different location.</li>
            <li> Comb kept coming off, Worst dryer ever.</li>
            <li> Love this hair dryer - I had brought one similar to it in June 2013 - so far this one is performing well.  I was aware of some of the defects that others had complained about - but so far so good.  Its a keeper.</li>
            <li> Gave as a gift to my 16 year old she loves it. Her hair is short but this dryer is very easy to use and she loves the comb.</li>
            <li> I first experienced this hairdryer when I was in cosmetology school (this is the dryers that came in our kits)  I LOVE IT! it drys my hair so fast that after a good 7 years of me using it constantly on clients or myself and all throughout school it gave out on me so I found it here and it was worth the buy again!  Dry time is shorter and it has power!</li>
            <li> I like this dryer a lot, but it slips all over when it&#x27;s rested on a flat surface.  Could be easily remedied by adding a small &amp;#34;bumper&amp;#34; to each side, like the unit I had before this one.  It&#x27;s nice and light, which is helpful.  And it does a great job of drying fast.</li>
            <li> es practico y bueno... encantada con el producto desde vargas venezuela&lt;br /&gt;se los recomiendo.. el producto llego en buen estado</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer for 3 reasons,: 1. My dryer is about to pass on 2. I have arthritis in my shoulder &amp; wanted a lighter weight one &amp; 3. Based on the reviews here I purchased this dryer. I wasn&#x27;t planning on paying a ton for a dryer, my daughter&#x27;s a professional &amp; I don&#x27;t see any difference in her high priced ones, except they are for professional wear &amp; tear!&lt;br /&gt;I have fairly long, course, thick hair, that has always taken FOREVER to dry. Well, my hair was dry in half the time &amp; it is lighter than my other dryer, so it didnt kill my shoulder &amp; irritate my arthritis. It has a nice defusser, nice &amp; small, not long like others so you can actually hold it away from your hair &amp; not burn your hair or scalp. I am very pleased so far &amp; will look for other hair care products by this company. I definetly would recommend it!!</li>
            <li> Finally found a dryer that straigthens my hair without overheating it. I have had great experiences with Andis products. I LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li> I  purchased this product because I understood the Ionic feature does not allow your hair to dry out.  Not true, my hair gets very dry but it is a nice dryer.</li>
            <li> Works better than any I have used in the past.  Recommended by my beautician.</li>
            <li> This dryer is amazing! Where my old ionic dryer took about 15-20 minutes to dry my hair (leaving it extremely frizzy and in need of a great deal of straightening iron time), this dryer works as good as any professional dryer but at 1/5th the cost (or less!). It literally takes 5 minutes to dry my hair, which is down to my shoulder blades and average thickness, and even though I still need to iron out a few frizzies, my hair is so much smoother than with my old dryer!</li>
            <li> Quick and so light. Hair blowing is a breeze with this one.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I was really impressed with this Andis 80405 lightweight ceramic ionic blow dryer. My hair was more straighter than I thought it would be. I  also love the comb attachment.</li>
            <li> It works pretty good is easy to hold and not heavy like some of those out there.I really like this.</li>
            <li> Dries my hair really fast!  Love the product and would highly recommend.  My daughter loved it also.  Product received on time.</li>
            <li> This is the best hair dryer I have ever purchased. Dries my hair quickly and does not make a lot of noise.</li>
            <li> Just LOUD!  Be prepared for a jumbo jet sound.  Other than that, it&#x27;s a great dryer, quick, clean and to the point.</li>
            <li> This dries my long thick hair in no time flat without frizz or heat damage!  Wish I had bought this instead of my last one!  Nice dryer!!</li>
            <li> I had a different hair dryer by Andis and it lasted for 3 years.  This hair dryer I purchased in April and 4 months later a part broke or came loose inside the dryer.  Now, it sounds like it&#x27;s going to explode when I turn it on.</li>
            <li> Great hairdryer. I&#x27;ve added a diffuser, and it&#x27;s great for my curly (and therefore frizz-prone) hair.</li>
            <li> Excellent.  I love this dryer.</li>
            <li> I have Type 4 Chemically Relaxed hair and I NEED the pick attachment to get my hair shiny straight &amp; &amp;#34;swishy&amp;#34;.  My problem with previous dryers was my pick attachment always falling off &amp; when it did stay on, it overheated my dryer which slowed my dry time.  My hair was dry in 3 minutes and the pick attachment stayed on &amp; tight throughout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy Happy Happy!</li>
            <li> it works fine, i am buying a new one. I thought this would be fine for work but as it turns out, its rather loud, has no heat settings, and the concentrator falls off.....</li>
            <li> I found this dryer to be sufficiant for my needaa bot a little onn the heavy side. So far it has worked out welll.&lt;br /&gt;Linda</li>
            <li> I love this dryer. It is the best one I ever owned. I would recommend it to anyone.Thank  you for having low prices.</li>
            <li> I have short hair and it lasted about 3 months, one day overheated and died.  Had to buy new one locally, cut my loses and tossed.  Would never never buy again.</li>
            <li> The hotels I normally stay at carry this brand of blow dryer.  After a few tries and loved the power and level of dry time, I just had to order it.  I got the regular and travel size.  Love them both.</li>
            <li> Received it today...the first thing that i did was blowdry my hair.</li>
            <li> I love this blow dryer. It does exactly what i want it to do. It has a comb attachment I could not find a dryer like this in the stores for some reason but saw it on here and had to have it. The price was very affordable and it had Tourmaline in it.</li>
            <li> Love the blow dryer, especially the pick attachment.  However, tried to order a replacement pick (pick teeth break easily) and found Andis has discontinued this item so had to go online to find another pick.  May not be able to replace eventually.</li>
