            <li>&amp; safely!</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if a sunscreen that was oil would truly work, but it did!</li>
            <li>LOVE it!</li>
            <li>So if you like that smell you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li>It is light and smells great.</li>
            <li>It also smells really good :)</li>
            <li>I got a nice tan and had no skin issues.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very moisturizing and smells great, so I don&#x27;t need moisturizer or perfume!</li>
            <li>But it does smell nice even though the fragrance does not like linger.</li>
            <li>It smells great, is easy to apply, soaks in well, and works well in Hawaii and Mexico :)</li>
            <li>Easy to use and apply and smells good.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>a bit lighter than most oils.</li>
            <li>Make sure to re-apply every now and then.</li>
            <li>Overall, I have been very happy with it.</li>
            <li>It smells like coconut which I love.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like 3 products in one, and I freaking love it.</li>
            <li>Smells fantastic!  </li>
            <li>It does smell like beach :)....</li>
            <li>This is my favorite.</li>
            <li>Alba also makes my favorite lip balm.</li>
            <li>I love the Alba line of products.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it is natural and it smells great as well.</li>
            <li>Offers great protection and goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for a huge coconut blast and - uh uh.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very moisturizing, &amp; gives the body a nice glisten (great for gogodancing or if youre doing some event where you need some extra sheen).</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s kind of greasy of course, being based on oil, but this helps so much to keep the skin from drying out and peeling.  </li>
            <li>This is the only light oil that is soft on the skin provides a light SPF and smells great!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy-in fact my skin soaked it right up!</li>
            <li>It works really good with only being a 15 SPF.</li>
            <li>too when I went out, because it seriously is fragrant &amp; delicious &amp;</li>
            <li>This was the first time that I have not burned and I was evenly tanned!</li>
            <li>I have been looking for more natural sunscreen products.</li>
            <li>It is an oil but quickly is absorbed into your skin (about 15 minutes on mine).</li>
            <li>I love this low spf sunscreen from Alba.</li>
            <li>I even bought a couple of extra bottles to make sure I didn&#x27;t run out.</li>
            <li>It smells almost exact to Hawaiian Tropics sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I do not do higher than SPF 15 with a chemical based sunscreen.</li>
            <li>And it does not spray out evenly or consistently.  </li>
            <li>I love the coconut dry oil.</li>
            <li>The scent is strong and will last on your skin like a perfume.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t worry too much about sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Plus, it&#x27;s really cheap compared to similar items!</li>
            <li>It smells terrific &amp; goes on so smooth.</li>
            <li>coconut is a different smell from all the fruity florals that women are wearing or the musky sweet man scents.  </li>
            <li>This contains chemical sunscreens (similar to the Olay Daily Facials SPF 15) but nothing that bothers my skin, and it smells good enough that I often like to use it as a body moisturizer</li>
            <li>I really enjoy this dry oil.</li>
            <li>(that was in my high school days), but I can see this giving a lot of \\&quot;tan\\&quot; after being out in the sun fora</li>
            <li>I am fair skinned and usually end up with a blotchy sunburn with traditional sunscreens.</li>
            <li>Smells good, gives a deep tanning and it&#x27;s hard to find in store.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>And all natural!</li>
            <li>I love the smell, and the low spf means I&#x27;m getting less chemicals on my skin.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin to sunscreen, then I would truly recommend this sunscreen.</li>
            <li>And as far as that goes- this product rocks.</li>
            <li>I strongly prefer nonchemical sunblock to sunscreen as a general rule, but that is hard to find in an SPF 15, and this is a reasonable compromise for when you&#x27;d like to tan but not burn.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve searched high and low, but found it here!</li>
            <li>Some of the chemicals in major brands are ironically carcinogenic!</li>
            <li>and it does not cause any skin irritations or breakouts, which is a major plus in my mind.</li>
            <li>The spray nozzle on this bottle does not work very well so that not much product comes put when you try to spray.  </li>
            <li>I live in Florida, so I have to be careful about tanning-</li>
            <li>It did keep my skin smooth and moisturized during a week at the beach, and achieved the slightly tanned look I was wanting by alternating this with the Neutral Skin and Hair SPF 33 not chemical sunblock to let a little bit of sun get through.  </li>

            <li> But - and this is just a personal thing- to me, it smells a little like bug spray.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a double pack (read small print)...</li>
            <li> Used it in the Carribean sun when I was out for four hours or less.  </li>
            <li> Only downside is it&#x27;s oil base- very greasy when you put it on!</li>
            <li> I like this for an everyday sun protection spray for my arms and chest.</li>
            <li> but for everyday sun protection as you&#x27;re out</li>
            <li> I am also not really confident in this products SPF properties.  </li>
            <li> Stopped my peeling once I had a base tan and was willing to use 15.</li>
            <li> I usually get allergic reactions to sunblock, but I have been wearing this all summer and no issues!</li>
            <li> What makes me really unhappy about this product is that it is not at all moisturizing (I know it is a DRY oil).</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> but I worry about all the nasty chemicals in sunscreens.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love the smell of this oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I get out of the shower and spray it on and I smell like delicious coconuts!</li>
            <li> Stays on, smells great, leaves skin moisturized and feeling good. People are always taking mine so now I buy them in the 2 pack!</li>
            <li> I love this low spf sunscreen from Alba. The ingredients are healthy and it smells great! It&#x27;s not too greasy, either...a bit lighter than most oils.</li>
            <li> This is a great tanning lotion. Smells good, gives a deep tanning and it&#x27;s hard to find in store.  I&#x27;ve searched high and low, but found it here! You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Bought as add on with Alba sun block. It is great, smells real good. Makes my skin feel moist but not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;My granddaughter tried it and loved it so I ordered a couple for her and she uses even when not going out doors.</li>
            <li> Perfect for protective tanning. And all natural! Can&#x27;t get any better!</li>
            <li> I love the coconut dry oil. Yes, I wore it as a fragrance of sorts (body oil) too when I went out, because it seriously is fragrant &amp; delicious &amp; coconut is a different smell from all the fruity florals that women are wearing or the musky sweet man scents.  ANYway on to what the product actually does. It&#x27;s very moisturizing, &amp; gives the body a nice glisten (great for gogodancing or if youre doing some event where you need some extra sheen). I also laid out in the sun with it 7 got some color. I&#x27;m not a tanner anymore (that was in my high school days), but I can see this giving a lot of \\&quot;tan\\&quot; after being out in the sun fora while. It&#x27;s important to get that Vitamin D!! &amp; safely!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if a sunscreen that was oil would truly work, but it did! I am fair skinned and usually end up with a blotchy sunburn with traditional sunscreens. This was the first time that I have not burned and I was evenly tanned! I love the fact that it is natural and it smells great as well. The only downside is reapplying while outside because then your hands are oily. That&#x27;s not really a big deal, though, when this works so well!</li>
            <li> Offers great protection and goes on smooth.</li>
            <li> Love this sunscreen!! It works really good with only being a 15 SPF. If you have sensitive skin to sunscreen, then I would truly recommend this sunscreen. I have very sensitive skin and it does not cause any skin irritations or breakouts, which is a major plus in my mind. It also smells really good :)</li>
            <li> I have fair, sensative skin... I was on the hunt for a low SPF that would protect my skin from getting burned, but allow me to get a tan. I also needed something that wouldn&#x27;t make my skin break out. This WORKS! I got a nice tan and had no skin issues. I put it on my face and body. LOVE it! I even bought a couple of extra bottles to make sure I didn&#x27;t run out. Very easy to use. Spray all over, then rub in. Make sure to re-apply every now and then.</li>
            <li> I usually get allergic reactions to sunblock, but I have been wearing this all summer and no issues! It is light and smells great. Only downside is it&#x27;s oil base- very greasy when you put it on! Overall, I have been very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for more natural sunscreen products. I really enjoy this dry oil. It doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling greasy. The scent is strong and will last on your skin like a perfume. It smells almost exact to Hawaiian Tropics sunscreen. So if you like that smell you&#x27;ll love it! I like this for an everyday sun protection spray for my arms and chest. I wouldn&#x27;t put this on then head out to the beach but for everyday sun protection as you&#x27;re out and about I think its great. Easy to use and apply and smells good.</li>
            <li> It smells like coconut which I love.  Stopped my peeling once I had a base tan and was willing to use 15. Used it in the Carribean sun when I was out for four hours or less.  It worked great in water and on the beach.  No burns.  It is an oil but quickly is absorbed into your skin (about 15 minutes on mine).</li>
            <li> Love !! smells great, moisturizes...This is the only light oil that is soft on the skin provides a light SPF and smells great!</li>
            <li> I bought this to use strictly as a daily sunscreen, not for prolonged exposure, like at the beach or on the water. It&#x27;s not greasy (when appropriate amount applied), smells great, moisturizing, and convenient with spray bottle design.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a super pale girl, but I spend very little time in the sun anyway so I don&#x27;t worry too much about sunscreen. I do like to wear some on my exposed skin anyway, but I worry about all the nasty chemicals in sunscreens. Some of the chemicals in major brands are ironically carcinogenic! This is a perfect fit for me. I love the smell, and the low spf means I&#x27;m getting less chemicals on my skin. It&#x27;s also very moisturizing and smells great, so I don&#x27;t need moisturizer or perfume! It&#x27;s like 3 products in one, and I freaking love it. Plus, it&#x27;s really cheap compared to similar items!</li>
            <li> Smells fantastic!  Works great.  Doesn&#x27;t feel too oily.  Really great stuff.  Wore it during a trip to Mexico and it protected me while smelling like tropical perfume.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy-in fact my skin soaked it right up! Itsmells a-ok...It does smell like beach :)....awesome deal! it&#x27;s a double pack (read small print)...</li>
            <li> The smell and feel of this product is gorgeous.  It did keep my skin smooth and moisturized during a week at the beach, and achieved the slightly tanned look I was wanting by alternating this with the Neutral Skin and Hair SPF 33 not chemical sunblock to let a little bit of sun get through.  it&#x27;s kind of greasy of course, being based on oil, but this helps so much to keep the skin from drying out and peeling.  I strongly prefer nonchemical sunblock to sunscreen as a general rule, but that is hard to find in an SPF 15, and this is a reasonable compromise for when you&#x27;d like to tan but not burn.  I do not do higher than SPF 15 with a chemical based sunscreen. This contains chemical sunscreens (similar to the Olay Daily Facials SPF 15) but nothing that bothers my skin, and it smells good enough that I often like to use it as a body moisturizer - I wish it was made without sunscreen for this purpose!</li>
            <li> I have to say- you buy a tanning oil for the TANNING PROPERTIES! And as far as that goes- this product rocks. It gives you a nice even tan without the greasy feeling that makes you feel as if this might not be good for you. But - and this is just a personal thing- to me, it smells a little like bug spray. I was hoping for a huge coconut blast and - uh uh. But I will buy this again because it does what it says it will do. I live in Florida, so I have to be careful about tanning- but this gets my definite approval. Great product for the money.</li>
            <li> The spray nozzle on this bottle does not work very well so that not much product comes put when you try to spray.  And it does not spray out evenly or consistently.  What makes me really unhappy about this product is that it is not at all moisturizing (I know it is a DRY oil). I am also not really confident in this products SPF properties.  But it does smell nice even though the fragrance does not like linger.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the type that forgets to put sunscreen on. It&#x27;s a task. But with Alba&#x27;s Coconut oil I want to put it on even if I&#x27;m not in the sun. It smells terrific &amp; goes on so smooth. This is my favorite. Alba also makes my favorite lip balm. I love the Alba line of products.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best sunscreens I&#x27;ve used. It smells great, is easy to apply, soaks in well, and works well in Hawaii and Mexico :)</li>
