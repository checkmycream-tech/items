            <li>excellent product, worked very well on my skin.</li>
            <li>and im loving it.</li>
            <li>I use this and it peeled me nicely.</li>
            <li>Its more effective so your face can recover over night.</li>
            <li>I love the bright and smooth surface I am getting.  </li>
            <li>However, the customer service was absolutely amazing and they respond very quickly and efficiently.</li>
            <li>Does anyone know if it&#x27;s safe to use this product once the peeling has started?</li>
            <li>My makeup goes on so much better and my skin looks so much better without makeup as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have medium toned skin with many freckles/sunspots/light acne scars, so I&#x27;ve always been self-conscious without having foundation on.</li>
            <li>this product coz its more alcohol</li>
            <li>My make-up looks much better and smoother when I put it on.</li>
            <li>It takes most people 3 to 7 days to peel (using 2 bottles 2 days in a row)  </li>
            <li>After  more than a month 80% of my face had peeled</li>
            <li>I love the maxi peel product.</li>
            <li>I recconmend to refreshing your skin.</li>
            <li>I received the bottle and most of the liquid had spilled out.  </li>
            <li>you will love it..</li>
            <li>Make sure you contact the seller before making a purchase.</li>
            <li>so I purchased again just to be sure.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>There are many, much more safe alternatives.</li>
            <li>Be safe.</li>
            <li>i had a much better result just using a chemical peel</li>
            <li>But after a couple of days not using it at all, it got better.</li>
            <li>ok</li>
            <li>I love this product</li>
            <li>Now I still have more work to be done on my skin...</li>
            <li>Like my mom always told me if you want to be cute</li>
            <li>Love Love Love this product.  </li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>I do love it, I just wish the results were faster.</li>
            <li>like this because its pretty good while u keep using it.&lt;br /&gt;i recomended this to every people,</li>
            <li>Using it alone seems more like a strong toner, no peel results from the product alone.</li>
            <li>Considering this is a liquid solution, I was sure that it would be wrapped in bubble wrap or something to keep it secure.</li>
            <li>Obagi and other costly items make me get alligator skin, this stuff on a cotton ball is just wonderful!  </li>
            <li>I was told by the seller that since my skin is &amp;#34;not sensitive&amp;#34; this product would not cause irritation to my skin, therefore my skin will not peel easily.</li>
            <li>This stuff is too strong for your face.</li>
            <li>It works just fine, though I wish they had #4 &amp;#62;.&amp;#60;</li>
            <li>its a mild peel, safe to use on face.</li>
            <li>But ever since Monday, I&#x27;ve notice a huge difference in the amount of sebum my face produces.</li>
            <li>African american&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy i bought this product.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a reason for that saying, especially when it comes to my skin and what I would do to make my skin happy.....</li>
            <li>the results I was looking for especially after hearing great things about the product.</li>
            <li>my skin is smooth and even</li>
            <li>I think you should get the a cheap pray bottle from your beauty supply store or a perfume bottle.</li>
            <li>One woman in particular had darker skin than mine and she had amazing results.</li>
            <li>I love this product, its exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this peel for about 2 weeks now and it has significantly reduced my hyperpigmentation.</li>
            <li>but afterwards you have nice new skin</li>
            <li>This is the most amazing skin care product I&#x27;ve found in a long time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to apply more and instead of one day, I&#x27;m going to apply for two days straight.</li>
            <li>is so wiered looking my face, and instead my face is ok its really redness</li>
            <li>tremendous working working for meI have a problem to find something to clean</li>
            <li>I used 1 bottle on my full body on a Friday, i used another bottle on my full body Saturday, it is Sunday and my skin is just peeling like i&#x27;m recovering from 1st degree burns.</li>
            <li>I returned it and received a full refund.  </li>
            <li>Everyone is different, good luck.</li>
            <li>I use ambi now something mild to get rid of it hopefully.</li>
            <li>I love my new completion.thanx 2</li>
            <li>The bottle top had brown crust, the liquid has turned brown and this is straight out of the package on the first day</li>
            <li>I was looking to see some results as everyone else stated in their review within 2 weeks, and I did see some results after the first week!</li>
            <li>I applied sunscreen daily to protect my newly exposed skin and experienced no issues.</li>
            <li>I only used it just that one time because I wanted to see what kind of reaction or affect it would have on my skin.</li>
            <li>It was worth</li>
            <li>Its worth trying.</li>
            <li>Very good results at lightening dark spots and revealing fresh new skin.</li>
            <li>My package got to me super fast!</li>
            <li>He prescribed some steroids that helped a lot because my skin is pretty resilient and the wounds were still pretty fresh.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t peel very much and I&#x27;m still using it</li>
            <li>I really reccomend this to people because dead skin cells just peel off your face and its amazing!</li>
            <li>Maxi-Peel was the first I began to use and believe it or not, about 3 or 4 days into using it, my spots started fading.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied and I am actually ordering another bottle this weekend!</li>
            <li>I recommend to anybody;-)</li>
            <li>also makes your face clear and smooth.</li>
            <li>First I will say that I like this product line.  </li>
            <li>This stuff really works!</li>
            <li>I started out the first 2 days using twice a day</li>
            <li>Would I purchase it again, most likely.</li>
            <li>This was exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>After the peeling stopped my skin was soooooooooo soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t do like I did and jump head first into using it....</li>
            <li>I just love how it fade my freckles and make my face soft and clear.</li>
            <li>It is embarrassing to be at school (senior in High school) and peel, but I dont really care as long as the results are amazing.</li>
            <li>This is a mild peel that can be used frequently but you must moisturize.</li>
            <li>I give five because it makes my skin clear and beautiful,its good for dark skin,too..</li>
            <li>Hydroquinone is the gold standard for dark pigment, and the tretinoin gives a nice, gentle peel that can be used even the night before a special event.</li>
            <li>I use this almost every night like how it was instructed (I skip some days because it would burn too much).</li>
            <li>This product works very well for me to exfoliate the skin without redness, burning,or irritation.  </li>
            <li>Had to use so much of it</li>
            <li>and I order sebo de macho coz of my face its looks like scars and its really dry&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>very efficient.</li>
            <li>Not too much leaked</li>
            <li>but once it peels it really peels.</li>
            <li>I wanted to wait awhile before I reviewed this product to give it some time to really work.</li>
            <li>They need to have a foil seal under the cap that we remove when we&#x27;re ready to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>so be careful and make sure to moisturize and use sunblock when going out.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I didnt notice much peeling at all after days of use.</li>
            <li>Just really doesn;t sem to work at all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been on this product for a month now and it really works.  </li>
            <li>The maxi peel should be a light yellow color.</li>
            <li>and she said it really worked for her</li>
            <li>&#x3D;ne cant to wait for the night to do what i need thanks so much</li>
            <li>Today my skin is almost (keyword almost) back to normal, and i consider myself very lucky.</li>
            <li>It works better as a booster to other products.</li>
            <li>First time using it,it game me a good results</li>
            <li>I love this stuff it works faster than RX medication I have spent hundreds of dollars on, On the 3rd day I had peeling on my chin above my top lip and jaw area.</li>
            <li>My order came quickly which is a plus,  one thing I didn&#x27;t like was my bottle was slightly open so some of the liquid spilled out</li>
            <li>I will order again because I still saved a lot of money, just two bottles to make sure I actually get enough to use for a while.</li>
            <li>Skin not as smooth as i expected.</li>
            <li>If you want a product to quickly clear imperfections and for VERY short-term use then give it a try.</li>
            <li>So one day about 8 mos ago I saw a YouTube video in which a young, African American lady with severe acne scarring and hyper-pigmentation described her journey to better, clearer skin.  </li>
            <li>I actually received one bottles worth of the product.  </li>
            <li>The solo sprayer comes out kind of in a heavy spray and will use up the solution much quicker, plus you can just buy the cheaper smaller plastic bottle for like .99 cents.</li>
            <li>The sellers were apologetic and sent new product to my home (at a different address) which was nice, but the product was a dark brown color this time.</li>
            <li>I am actually using this product again right now.  </li>
            <li>If you have normal to sensitive skin in my situation, you would have been SCREWED!</li>
            <li>I now have a new look ..  </li>
            <li>Well, it&#x27;s a strong product and it recommends using it on no more than 10% of your whole body at any one time.  </li>
            <li>Smooth and noticeably fewer dark spots, plus NO breakouts.</li>
            <li>This is my second time using the maxi peel the first time I didn&#x27;t know what to expect but after addressing my concerns to thr seller he sent me another one.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s most likely that the seller gave me a watered down version of the product.</li>
            <li>br /&gt;It smells like a super strong chemical that you would think has some dramatic effect on the skin&lt;br /&gt;Caused</li>
            <li>and I can skip acne treatment when I use this as it keeps my skin clear.</li>
            <li>And it clear up my freckles.</li>
            <li>Also, if you get it near your eyes, you&#x27;ll start tearing.  </li>
            <li>As far as the product itself, it is somewhat working.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t feel so self conscious about my skin.</li>
            <li>Skin will be sensitive to exfoliating and scrubby pads.</li>
            <li>I was surprised about that.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t have no effect except drying up my skin making it look old.</li>
            <li>but I really should have only applied it for 2 days instead of 3.</li>
            <li>pretty disappointed since I was so excited to get more.</li>
            <li>I paid full for half of the content.</li>
            <li>The price is a little high for the size of the bottle, but its worth the price based on my results.  </li>
            <li>The new skin is soooo soft but it&#x27;s too soon for me to tell whether there is a different in the skin discolorations.</li>
            <li>I only gave it 3 stars because I expected better results as far as lightening of the dark spots, but I&#x27;ll try it for another month and give you guys another review/update.</li>
            <li>Nothing major</li>
            <li>hope my skin face back to normal its so scary, coz before I seen the review its nice review</li>
            <li>I was so skeptical about this product at first, but I tried it because it had a average of 5 stars, i love it!</li>
            <li>I later found out that meant the product had been exposed and was old.</li>
            <li>This feedback about the packaging and the seller&#x27;s failure to secure the content.</li>
            <li>Dark spots aren&#x27;t much lighter but I am a cheer coach so I&#x27;m in the sun a lot.</li>
            <li>This product dried my mild adult acne up within a week, it also lighten dark areas on my face within two weeks</li>
            <li>skin burned like no other for no apparent reason....</li>
            <li>and maybe there was like half left because it was not sealed very well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smell is a little offsetting, but tolerable if you really want clearer skin.  </li>
            <li>I have several dark spots, some on my face but mainly on my neck, chest and back from acne scarring.</li>

            <li> I do love it, I just wish the results were faster.</li>
            <li> like this because its pretty good while u keep using it.&lt;br /&gt;i recomended this to every people,</li>
            <li> Using it alone seems more like a strong toner, no peel results from the product alone.</li>
            <li> Considering this is a liquid solution, I was sure that it would be wrapped in bubble wrap or something to keep it secure.</li>
            <li> Obagi and other costly items make me get alligator skin, this stuff on a cotton ball is just wonderful!  </li>
            <li> I was told by the seller that since my skin is &amp;#34;not sensitive&amp;#34; this product would not cause irritation to my skin, therefore my skin will not peel easily.</li>
            <li> This stuff is too strong for your face.</li>
            <li> It works just fine, though I wish they had #4 &amp;#62;.&amp;#60;</li>
            <li> its a mild peel, safe to use on face.</li>
            <li> But ever since Monday, I&#x27;ve notice a huge difference in the amount of sebum my face produces.</li>
            <li> African american&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy i bought this product.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a reason for that saying, especially when it comes to my skin and what I would do to make my skin happy.....</li>
            <li> the results I was looking for especially after hearing great things about the product.</li>
            <li> my skin is smooth and even</li>
            <li> I think you should get the a cheap pray bottle from your beauty supply store or a perfume bottle.</li>
            <li> One woman in particular had darker skin than mine and she had amazing results.</li>
            <li> I love this product, its exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this peel for about 2 weeks now and it has significantly reduced my hyperpigmentation.</li>
            <li> but afterwards you have nice new skin</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing skin care product I&#x27;ve found in a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to apply more and instead of one day, I&#x27;m going to apply for two days straight.</li>
            <li> is so wiered looking my face, and instead my face is ok its really redness</li>
            <li> tremendous working working for meI have a problem to find something to clean</li>
            <li> I used 1 bottle on my full body on a Friday, i used another bottle on my full body Saturday, it is Sunday and my skin is just peeling like i&#x27;m recovering from 1st degree burns.</li>
            <li> I returned it and received a full refund.  </li>
            <li> Everyone is different, good luck.</li>
            <li> I use ambi now something mild to get rid of it hopefully.</li>
            <li> I love my new completion.thanx 2</li>
            <li> The bottle top had brown crust, the liquid has turned brown and this is straight out of the package on the first day</li>
            <li> I was looking to see some results as everyone else stated in their review within 2 weeks, and I did see some results after the first week!</li>
            <li> I applied sunscreen daily to protect my newly exposed skin and experienced no issues.</li>
            <li> I only used it just that one time because I wanted to see what kind of reaction or affect it would have on my skin.</li>
            <li> It was worth</li>
            <li> Its worth trying.</li>
            <li> Very good results at lightening dark spots and revealing fresh new skin.</li>
            <li> My package got to me super fast!</li>
            <li> He prescribed some steroids that helped a lot because my skin is pretty resilient and the wounds were still pretty fresh.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t peel very much and I&#x27;m still using it</li>
            <li> I really reccomend this to people because dead skin cells just peel off your face and its amazing!</li>
            <li> Maxi-Peel was the first I began to use and believe it or not, about 3 or 4 days into using it, my spots started fading.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied and I am actually ordering another bottle this weekend!</li>
            <li> I recommend to anybody;-)</li>
            <li> also makes your face clear and smooth.</li>
            <li> First I will say that I like this product line.  </li>
            <li> This stuff really works!</li>
            <li> I started out the first 2 days using twice a day</li>
            <li> Would I purchase it again, most likely.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> After the peeling stopped my skin was soooooooooo soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t do like I did and jump head first into using it....</li>
            <li> I just love how it fade my freckles and make my face soft and clear.</li>
            <li> It is embarrassing to be at school (senior in High school) and peel, but I dont really care as long as the results are amazing.</li>
            <li> This is a mild peel that can be used frequently but you must moisturize.</li>
            <li> I give five because it makes my skin clear and beautiful,its good for dark skin,too..</li>
            <li> Hydroquinone is the gold standard for dark pigment, and the tretinoin gives a nice, gentle peel that can be used even the night before a special event.</li>
            <li> I use this almost every night like how it was instructed (I skip some days because it would burn too much).</li>
            <li> This product works very well for me to exfoliate the skin without redness, burning,or irritation.  </li>
            <li> Had to use so much of it</li>
            <li> and I order sebo de macho coz of my face its looks like scars and its really dry&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> very efficient.</li>
            <li> Not too much leaked</li>
            <li> but once it peels it really peels.</li>
            <li> I wanted to wait awhile before I reviewed this product to give it some time to really work.</li>
            <li> They need to have a foil seal under the cap that we remove when we&#x27;re ready to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> so be careful and make sure to moisturize and use sunblock when going out.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> I didnt notice much peeling at all after days of use.</li>
            <li> Just really doesn;t sem to work at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on this product for a month now and it really works.  </li>
            <li> The maxi peel should be a light yellow color.</li>
            <li> and she said it really worked for her</li>
            <li> &#x3D;ne cant to wait for the night to do what i need thanks so much</li>
            <li> Today my skin is almost (keyword almost) back to normal, and i consider myself very lucky.</li>
            <li> It works better as a booster to other products.</li>
            <li> First time using it,it game me a good results</li>
            <li> I love this stuff it works faster than RX medication I have spent hundreds of dollars on, On the 3rd day I had peeling on my chin above my top lip and jaw area.</li>
            <li> My order came quickly which is a plus,  one thing I didn&#x27;t like was my bottle was slightly open so some of the liquid spilled out</li>
            <li> I will order again because I still saved a lot of money, just two bottles to make sure I actually get enough to use for a while.</li>
            <li> Skin not as smooth as i expected.</li>
            <li> If you want a product to quickly clear imperfections and for VERY short-term use then give it a try.</li>
            <li> So one day about 8 mos ago I saw a YouTube video in which a young, African American lady with severe acne scarring and hyper-pigmentation described her journey to better, clearer skin.  </li>
            <li> I actually received one bottles worth of the product.  </li>
            <li> The solo sprayer comes out kind of in a heavy spray and will use up the solution much quicker, plus you can just buy the cheaper smaller plastic bottle for like .99 cents.</li>
            <li> The sellers were apologetic and sent new product to my home (at a different address) which was nice, but the product was a dark brown color this time.</li>
            <li> I am actually using this product again right now.  </li>
            <li> If you have normal to sensitive skin in my situation, you would have been SCREWED!</li>
            <li> I now have a new look ..  </li>
            <li> Well, it&#x27;s a strong product and it recommends using it on no more than 10% of your whole body at any one time.  </li>
            <li> Smooth and noticeably fewer dark spots, plus NO breakouts.</li>
            <li> This is my second time using the maxi peel the first time I didn&#x27;t know what to expect but after addressing my concerns to thr seller he sent me another one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s most likely that the seller gave me a watered down version of the product.</li>
            <li> br /&gt;It smells like a super strong chemical that you would think has some dramatic effect on the skin&lt;br /&gt;Caused</li>
            <li> and I can skip acne treatment when I use this as it keeps my skin clear.</li>
            <li> And it clear up my freckles.</li>
            <li> Also, if you get it near your eyes, you&#x27;ll start tearing.  </li>
            <li> As far as the product itself, it is somewhat working.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t feel so self conscious about my skin.</li>
            <li> Skin will be sensitive to exfoliating and scrubby pads.</li>
            <li> I was surprised about that.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t have no effect except drying up my skin making it look old.</li>
            <li> but I really should have only applied it for 2 days instead of 3.</li>
            <li> pretty disappointed since I was so excited to get more.</li>
            <li> I paid full for half of the content.</li>
            <li> The price is a little high for the size of the bottle, but its worth the price based on my results.  </li>
            <li> The new skin is soooo soft but it&#x27;s too soon for me to tell whether there is a different in the skin discolorations.</li>
            <li> I only gave it 3 stars because I expected better results as far as lightening of the dark spots, but I&#x27;ll try it for another month and give you guys another review/update.</li>
            <li> Nothing major</li>
            <li> hope my skin face back to normal its so scary, coz before I seen the review its nice review</li>
            <li> I was so skeptical about this product at first, but I tried it because it had a average of 5 stars, i love it!</li>
            <li> I later found out that meant the product had been exposed and was old.</li>
            <li> This feedback about the packaging and the seller&#x27;s failure to secure the content.</li>
            <li> Dark spots aren&#x27;t much lighter but I am a cheer coach so I&#x27;m in the sun a lot.</li>
            <li> This product dried my mild adult acne up within a week, it also lighten dark areas on my face within two weeks</li>
            <li> skin burned like no other for no apparent reason....</li>
            <li> and maybe there was like half left because it was not sealed very well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smell is a little offsetting, but tolerable if you really want clearer skin.  </li>
            <li> I have several dark spots, some on my face but mainly on my neck, chest and back from acne scarring.</li>
            <li> The first week I used it, I peeled the next week (the common snake like peel that everyone refers to).</li>
            <li> and I had to slow it down because my T-zone was getting too light.</li>
            <li> Keep in mind, your skin will definitely look flaky and weird for a few days, but the skin underneath is AMAZING.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I didn&#x27;t receive the real product or</li>
            <li> My skin start peeling after 3 days of using this product, and it hurts to re apply it again after it peel, and how long the peeling would last?</li>
            <li> Slow to peel at first</li>
            <li> I was so skeptical about purchasing this product until I was able to find reviews from dark skinned African Americans who tried this product.</li>
            <li> the peeling was not how I expected it to be, it was more like patches of flaking skin that was very unappealing to the eye.</li>
            <li> Left a dark scar big on my forehead</li>
            <li> I am African American, medium to dark skin tone (in range of singer Brandy)</li>
            <li> I have a long way to go</li>
            <li> The peeling on my face was uneven and took forever to complete.</li>
            <li> Be careful if product comes without tamper resistant seal, you actually don&#x27;t know what is inside the container.</li>
            <li> This stuff is intended to be used long term - and long term, this stuff causes cancer.</li>
            <li> but I have enough for another 2 tries</li>
            <li> I know monkey see</li>
            <li> monkey do...</li>
            <li> it took me 3 weeks for the dryness and peeling to stop, and it feels like my skin is still dry and has not completely recovered.</li>
            <li> Prior to using Maxi Peel, my face would become extremely oily.</li>
            <li> just because this worked for me and maybe some other women it might not work the same way for you.  </li>
            <li> when I bought this product it makes rednes my face and its dry now</li>
            <li> Works well if you put in a spray bottle, spray it on your body and let it dry.</li>
            <li> made my skin itchy and dry.</li>
            <li> I got out of the shower today and the skin on my face was really dry and stinging</li>
            <li> I applied it to my body(stomach, legs and buttocks) while it was dry...</li>
            <li> I rinsed off and toweled dry.  </li>
            <li> I actually ordered level 3 (which is 1 level above what I should&#x27;ve ordered) and this stiff did not disappoint.</li>
            <li> I just ordered a replacement from another seller and both were a really dark brow, which is completely different from what I ordered from this company...</li>
            <li> It got red of my pimples and dark spots</li>
            <li> Im a black female with hyperpigmentation on my jawline n</li>
            <li> The product had actually spilled inside of the box, and so half of it was already gone.</li>
            <li> For the last 3 years I&#x27;ve battled daily with hyper-pigmentation and it seemed that too often a new spot would show up at such wrong times!  </li>
            <li> Be careful because it will make your skin peel.</li>
            <li> Be careful for it will burn your skin.</li>
            <li> I had minimal peeling</li>
            <li> have used a considerable amount of lotion in the past few months because my skin is extremely dry now that ive used this</li>
            <li> People please be careful and listen to the other reviewers.</li>
            <li> so I would avoid putting anything on my face, other than makeup which contains spf15.  </li>
            <li> I using other products</li>
            <li> I used this product every other day for a week or so, and the peeling started by day 4 or so.</li>
            <li> , I didn&#x27;t peel like other people have</li>
            <li> On the other hand, maxi peel works.</li>
            <li> I shop at a oriental store twice a month and the other day when I was there</li>
            <li> The skin on my face was a little dry and flaky but I didn&#x27;t think it was feeling</li>
            <li> The peeling I have is very minimal with no irritation whatsoever.</li>
            <li> my bottle was half empty</li>
            <li> and they did not reply, the liquid was very dark and cause my skin to burn, the seller seem like they don&#x27;t want to answer because they do not want to refund or give me a brand new one, and from what i read if the liquid is dark that means it is no good.</li>
            <li> Only peeled a small amount of skin and then darken it a little.</li>
            <li> IT IS NOT WORTH ALL OF THE HYE</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product for users who are trying to lighten the dark circles under their eyes.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is my package was damaged and was leaking.</li>
            <li> RUINS YOUR SKIN</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a bout 4 weeks now and dark spots has faded and my skin has lightened a shade or so.</li>
            <li> Works well,exfoliate slowly so I can still go outside</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been pretty unhappy with other products that have promised and haven&#x27;t delivered.  </li>
            <li> It faded the dark spots that I&#x27;m using less makeup</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s slight peeling on my neck and face.</li>
            <li> The bottle was not sealed in any plastic so over half of the liquid spilled out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> The only thing is that my skin was extra tight and uncomfortable before it started to peel.</li>
            <li> because the one i got had no seal and it looks like half of it is missing like it was leaking.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Usually within an hour or so, my face is extremely oily.</li>
            <li> but it never did I&#x27;m a bit disappointed I was excited to purchase</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even a peel a little bit...</li>
            <li> It was a very dark brown burned color.</li>
            <li> I rarely give bad reviews.</li>
            <li> it was definitely a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Perhaps the product just doesn&#x27;t work well on me, is too harsh, or I may be allergic to it.</li>
            <li> $11 dollars wasted.</li>
            <li> I purchased this a few months ago and ran out before I saw results.....</li>
            <li> have wasted money&lt;</li>
            <li> It was suppose to peel off the dead skin, but it didn&#x27;t perform to expectation.</li>
            <li> I might try the green oil peel.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money buying this product.</li>
            <li> this product was a waste of time and money  </li>
            <li> I did not see any results  waste of time and money</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t like to use hydro quinine everyday as it&#x27;s a chemical</li>
            <li> I air dried and then applied Vaseline to my skin.  </li>
            <li> What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Instead of applying two nights in a row, I only applied one night due to getting the wrong strength.</li>
            <li> That really made me mad because I was so eager to try it.</li>
            <li> VERY LITTLE PEELING LITTLE LIGHTENING</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but have now reordered it on 3 different occasions!  </li>
            <li> Anyway I used the product on this past Monday.</li>
            <li> Not sure if having thicker skin prevents me from feeling burning sensations when using this peel</li>
            <li> I am acne prone and usually all my breakouts lead to hyperpigmentation.</li>
            <li> The manufacturers poorly contain the product, so it came nearly empty from leaking despite of the sellers trying to reinforce the packaging.</li>
            <li> I have been to the spa to get the expensive facial peels and have to say this works just as well.</li>
            <li> I usually start to peel anywhere from 2-3 days after I apply.</li>
            <li> I know I should of tested it on a small part of my skin.  </li>
            <li> please test it on a small part of your skin.</li>
            <li> The remaining liquid was a dark brwon color so that lets me no the product was no good.</li>
            <li> It had spilled all throughout the small plastic bag and envelope it was in.</li>
            <li> Although, I received this product very quickly,  it was packaged horribly.</li>
            <li> I was also very unhappy because when i opened it the seal was broken, actually there was no seal at all and a third of the content inside the bottle was already gone.</li>
            <li> I started using this to target the small brown spots on my hand - IT&#x27;S WORKING!</li>
            <li> So I have really bad acne scars and acne in general.</li>
            <li> Product very slow to send.</li>
            <li> Well nothing dramatic happened.</li>
            <li> If you plan to try this before a big event, I&#x27;d suggest doing it at LEAST 10 days beforehand, because the peeling isn&#x27;t terrible, but it is noticeable.</li>
            <li> but the extreme of the peel is so annoying that it makes me not like the product.</li>
            <li> The instructions are written on the inside of the box and difficult to understand.</li>
            <li> I regret buying this and ill</li>
            <li> i suggest you find another way to exfoliate because your disgusting looking peeling skin will not allow you to do anything outside without getting stares.</li>
            <li> I now know this stuff is illegal in 98% of the world.</li>
            <li> I use it randomly..</li>
            <li> Thankfully, I have (very) tough skin and went to the doctor immediately.</li>
            <li> Very poorly packaged.</li>

            <li> African american&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy i bought this product. I am suffering with severe hyperpigmentation and acne scars, with in one week my scars and hyperpigmentation started to fade ! Just use product in moderation and use sunscreen .</li>
            <li> This item was well package.&lt;br /&gt;Lid to bottle was taped in order to reduce leakage during shipping.&lt;br /&gt;I have heard alot of great this about this item.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using with great results.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use and order again.</li>
            <li> I am saving about $50 a month using this product instead of what my dermatologist is pushing.  I love the bright and smooth surface I am getting.  Obagi and other costly items make me get alligator skin, this stuff on a cotton ball is just wonderful!  I was skeptical but have now reordered it on 3 different occasions!  I am sold.</li>
            <li> Product is great. I just ordered a replacement from another seller and both were a really dark brow, which is completely different from what I ordered from this company...pretty disappointed since I was so excited to get more.</li>
            <li> its a mild peel, safe to use on face. Gave good results after 3-4 peels.&lt;br /&gt;I tried this on my hands, it did not work. Probably need a stronger peel for hands.&lt;br /&gt;It reserved my purpose.</li>
            <li> I have several dark spots, some on my face but mainly on my neck, chest and back from acne scarring. I was so skeptical about purchasing this product until I was able to find reviews from dark skinned African Americans who tried this product. One woman in particular had darker skin than mine and she had amazing results. So I ordered this product and it came within 3 days (on a Saturday). I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to come until the following Tuesday so that was definitely a plus...Anyway I used the product on this past Monday. I put some in a spray bottle and sprayed my chest, neck, and back. I put some on a cotton ball for the application on my face. I only used it just that one time because I wanted to see what kind of reaction or affect it would have on my skin. The next day I noticed that my skin felt a lot smoother than it was prior to application. I used Mary Kay&#x27;s day solution with spf 25 for two days.  Prior to using Maxi Peel, my face would become extremely oily. I found that moisturizing my face in the mornings would just increase the oil so I would avoid putting anything on my face, other than makeup which contains spf15.  But ever since Monday, I&#x27;ve notice a huge difference in the amount of sebum my face produces. Usually within an hour or so, my face is extremely oily. Yesterday I went the entire day without having to blot my face! Makeup stayed and looked flawless for over 8 hours! This morning I was rushing and forgot to apply the sunscreen to my face after showering. Once I got to work, I noticed the peeling had begun..There&#x27;s slight peeling on my neck and face. Nothing major but I didn&#x27;t expect to peel by using this product only once! The new skin is soooo soft but it&#x27;s too soon for me to tell whether there is a different in the skin discolorations. I haven&#x27;t had an opportunity to look at my back...So for me, 3 days after using it once, I started to peel! I&#x27;m going to apply more and instead of one day, I&#x27;m going to apply for two days straight. I will post a follow up review after my next application. Does anyone know if it&#x27;s safe to use this product once the peeling has started? The peeling I have is very minimal with no irritation whatsoever. I appreciate any feedback!</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t do anything for me at all it was definitely a waste of money. However, the customer service was absolutely amazing and they respond very quickly and efficiently.</li>
            <li> VERY LITTLE PEELING LITTLE LIGHTENING, I WOULD PERSONALLY NOT PURCHASE IT AGAIN. IT IS NOT WORTH ALL OF THE HYE</li>
            <li> So I have really bad acne scars and acne in general. After using this, I started to peel like crazy! It is embarrassing to be at school (senior in High school) and peel, but I dont really care as long as the results are amazing. I use this almost every night like how it was instructed (I skip some days because it would burn too much). ALSO, USE THIS AFTER YOU WASH YOUR FACE AT NIGHT. Its more effective so your face can recover over night. I really reccomend this to people because dead skin cells just peel off your face and its amazing!</li>
            <li> This product works very well for me to exfoliate the skin without redness, burning,or irritation.  I will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a reason for that saying, especially when it comes to my skin and what I would do to make my skin happy.....And that includes giving it a peel 2-3x / week with Maxi-Peel.  IT WORKS.  For the last 3 years I&#x27;ve battled daily with hyper-pigmentation and it seemed that too often a new spot would show up at such wrong times!  I&#x27;ve been pretty unhappy with other products that have promised and haven&#x27;t delivered.  So one day about 8 mos ago I saw a YouTube video in which a young, African American lady with severe acne scarring and hyper-pigmentation described her journey to better, clearer skin.  Maxi-Peel was 1 of 5 different products that she&#x27;d included in her daily / weekly regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I caved about a month ago and bought 3 of the 5 she talked about in her video.  Maxi-Peel was the first I began to use and believe it or not, about 3 or 4 days into using it, my spots started fading.  Today, they are still noticeable, but continue to fade.  I&#x27;m happy.  My makeup goes on so much better and my skin looks so much better without makeup as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DOWNSIDE??  Well, it&#x27;s a strong product and it recommends using it on no more than 10% of your whole body at any one time.  Also, if you get it near your eyes, you&#x27;ll start tearing.  It&#x27;s smell is a little offsetting, but tolerable if you really want clearer skin.  I started using this to target the small brown spots on my hand - IT&#x27;S WORKING!</li>
            <li> Item was delivered on time. As far as the product itself, it is somewhat working. Skin seems to improve tho I using other products so I have no clue what it did or didnt do.&lt;br /&gt;What I noticed today is that my complexion is a bit lighter which can only come from this product</li>
            <li> This product is very potent. I actually ordered level 3 (which is 1 level above what I should&#x27;ve ordered) and this stiff did not disappoint. Instead of applying two nights in a row, I only applied one night due to getting the wrong strength. My face peeled the entire week! I applied sunscreen daily to protect my newly exposed skin and experienced no issues. I will continue to use this product 1x weekly until I achieve the results I want. Best exfoliant I&#x27;ve ever used and safer than a chemical peel in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Tried it on a whim, wanting something for the hyperpigmentation on my skin. Used it as instructed for a month, and nothing! I may as well have been putting water on my skin. No seal on the bottle. Save your money and get the Xtreme Brite gel. Now that is amazing!</li>
            <li> Skin not as smooth as i expected. Left a dark scar big on my forehead that&#x27;s still there going on 4 months. I wear a bang to cover it. I use ambi now something mild to get rid of it hopefully. This stuff is too strong for your face.</li>
            <li> I had hideous brown spots on my cheeks and above my lip. Makeup wouldn&#x27;t even cover it. Had to use so much of it I looked cake faced. But maxi peel worked miracles. It faded the dark spots that I&#x27;m using less makeup and I don&#x27;t feel so self conscious about my skin. I&#x27;ve used it for about three weeks and I&#x27;m so happy on the results</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t work for ME at all!! I haven&#x27;t had any peeling not anything. I will not purchase anymore.</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing skin care product I&#x27;ve found in a long time. I have medium toned skin with many freckles/sunspots/light acne scars, so I&#x27;ve always been self-conscious without having foundation on. I used this product every other day for a week or so, and the peeling started by day 4 or so. Keep in mind, your skin will definitely look flaky and weird for a few days, but the skin underneath is AMAZING. I feel like I have someone else&#x27;s face! Smooth and noticeably fewer dark spots, plus NO breakouts. I&#x27;m hooked. If you plan to try this before a big event, I&#x27;d suggest doing it at LEAST 10 days beforehand, because the peeling isn&#x27;t terrible, but it is noticeable.</li>
            <li> when I bought this product it makes rednes my face and its dry now and it looks like burn my face is so wiered looking my face, and instead my face is ok its really redness and I order sebo de macho coz of my face its looks like scars and its really dry&lt;br /&gt;I hope my skin face back to normal its so scary, coz before I seen the review its nice review all the customer and I asked my dr. she said that I am allergy this product coz its more alcohol&lt;br /&gt;So I cant recommend this product to everybody</li>
            <li> African American...dark spots from acne. Nothing drastic happened, but my.skin feels smoother, I didn&#x27;t peel like other people have but I haven&#x27;t had a breakouts in a month. Dark spots aren&#x27;t much lighter but I am a cheer coach so I&#x27;m in the sun a lot. My Advice...wear sunscreen!!!! My make-up looks much better and smoother when I put it on. I have a long way to go but I am very satisfied. My order came quickly which is a plus,  one thing I didn&#x27;t like was my bottle was slightly open so some of the liquid spilled out but all and all I&#x27;m satisfied and I am actually ordering another bottle this weekend! I only gave it 3 stars because I expected better results as far as lightening of the dark spots, but I&#x27;ll try it for another month and give you guys another review/update.</li>
            <li> is there suppose to be a seal on the bottle? because the one i got had no seal and it looks like half of it is missing like it was leaking.&lt;br /&gt; i dont no if i should use this or not can someone tell me if the one u got had a seal or not....i am disappointed</li>
            <li> tremendous working working for meI have a problem to find something to clean my facea deuce brother did it for me</li>
            <li> Great product it is truly working I have been using it for about 3 weeks now and I can see the results of my skin improving.  One thing that I must warn over use can burn the skin.  I really like this product.</li>
            <li> I did not like this product.  The instructions are written on the inside of the box and difficult to understand. I did not get any visible results.  I would not recommend this product for users who are trying to lighten the dark circles under their eyes.</li>
            <li> Ok, the product does work i will say that...BUUUUUTTTTTTT!!!!! I regret buying this and ill never buy it again. My skin is peeling like a snake and it looks ugly and disgusting. I know its a peel and that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s suppose to do but the extreme of the peel is so annoying that it makes me not like the product. I used 1 bottle on my full body on a Friday, i used another bottle on my full body Saturday, it is Sunday and my skin is just peeling like i&#x27;m recovering from 1st degree burns. If you have no problem with walking around looking like snake&#x27;s on a plane for 3 to 5 days then order by the pound because the product will make you peel.It takes most people 3 to 7 days to peel (using 2 bottles 2 days in a row)  but i peeled in 2 days (suing 1 bottle 2 days in a row) and i wish i was one of the people that it didn&#x27;t work on. if you have things to do in the outside world like work school or just want to chill at the beach i suggest you find another way to exfoliate because your disgusting looking peeling skin will not allow you to do anything outside without getting stares. 5 stars because it does do what it say it&#x27;ll do but i took 2 stars away and gave it 3 because of the way you&#x27;ll have to walk around for the next 5 days.</li>
            <li> The peeling on my face was uneven and took forever to complete. After  more than a month 80% of my face had peeled but I was left with a rash.&lt;br /&gt;Not the results I was looking for especially after hearing great things about the product. Perhaps the product just doesn&#x27;t work well on me, is too harsh, or I may be allergic to it. Either way I wont be buying again.</li>
            <li> excellent product, worked very well on my skin. very efficient. I love the maxi peel product. I recconmend to refreshing your skin.</li>
            <li> I was forever getting bumps on my face and scars after they healed. Yes it peels but afterwards you have nice new skin and im loving it. This will not keep you from going outdoors. Just use sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Product works very effectively. Be careful because it will make your skin peel. Skin will be sensitive to exfoliating and scrubby pads. Very good results at lightening dark spots and revealing fresh new skin. I am African American, medium to dark skin tone (in range of singer Brandy) and I had to slow it down because my T-zone was getting too light. Only complaint is my package was damaged and was leaking. Not too much leaked and I just didn&#x27;t feel like dealing with the merchant or Amazon at the time.</li>
            <li> Made me peel in around 4 days. Works well if you put in a spray bottle, spray it on your body and let it dry.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. Hydroquinone is the gold standard for dark pigment, and the tretinoin gives a nice, gentle peel that can be used even the night before a special event. I have acne and I can skip acne treatment when I use this as it keeps my skin clear. I try never to run out of this.</li>
            <li> i choose this rating because they had a good deliver in time or early.&lt;br /&gt;i like this because its pretty good while u keep using it.&lt;br /&gt;i recomended this to every people,</li>
            <li> I received the bottle and most of the liquid had spilled out.  I returned it and received a full refund.  I was surprised about that.  Good looking out to the company.  Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t make my skin peel at all. It didn&#x27;t have no effect except drying up my skin making it look old. I even applied it two time a day but no peeling what so ever.</li>
            <li> Works well. Slow to peel at first but once it peels it really peels. I had to speed up the peeling process because my ego or self consciousness wouldn&#x27;t allow me to go into public peeling.</li>
            <li> From what I research on this item my skin was suppose to peel but it never did I&#x27;m a bit disappointed I was excited to purchase, it didn&#x27;t work for me</li>
            <li> This feedback about the packaging and the seller&#x27;s failure to secure the content. Very poorly packaged. They only put a tape to kinda seal the bottle. When I got the product the content spilled all over and maybe there was like half left because it was not sealed very well. I paid full for half of the content. I feel ripped off. On the other hand, maxi peel works.</li>
            <li> I use this product in addition to Rx Tretinoin cream. I also apply it before a Salicylic Acid 20% peel. It works better as a booster to other products. Using it alone seems more like a strong toner, no peel results from the product alone. I do like the product and will continue to buy it.</li>
            <li> I was severely disappointed with this product. I applies according to the directions for 6 days in a row and never peeled. This was over two weeks ago. I&#x27;m not sure if I didn&#x27;t receive the real product or it just doesn&#x27;t work. Will not buy again</li>
            <li> made my skin itchy and dry. the peeling was not how I expected it to be, it was more like patches of flaking skin that was very unappealing to the eye. it took me 3 weeks for the dryness and peeling to stop, and it feels like my skin is still dry and has not completely recovered. bottom line nobody should purchase this product.</li>
            <li> I give five because it makes my skin clear and beautiful,its good for dark skin,too..I recommend to anybody;-) you will love it..</li>
            <li> Be careful if product comes without tamper resistant seal, you actually don&#x27;t know what is inside the container. I returned the product because of this reason.</li>
            <li> i haven&#x27;t tried it yet ,but i will next week and i will updated you guys .I can;t wait.so i will updated soon</li>
            <li> I rarely give bad reviews. But this one is an exception. I purchased Maxi Peel from the seller Yollie&#x27;s oriental market. When I opened the packet the bottle had no tamper resistant seal, it was just taped around the cap. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it unless the bottle comes with a tamper resistant seal. You don&#x27;t know what of liquid is inside the bottle. People please be careful and listen to the other reviewers. $11 dollars wasted. Make sure you contact the seller before making a purchase.</li>
            <li> I wanted to wait awhile before I reviewed this product to give it some time to really work. I purchased this a few months ago and ran out before I saw results.....so I purchased again just to be sure. Well nothing dramatic happened. The first week I used it, I peeled the next week (the common snake like peel that everyone refers to). However, no change in my hyper pigmentation.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Cleared up breakouts&lt;br /&gt;My skin is smoother&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;My skin burned like no other for no apparent reason....no changes&lt;br /&gt;My acne spots are still visible&lt;br /&gt;I have wasted money&lt;br /&gt;It smells like a super strong chemical that you would think has some dramatic effect on the skin&lt;br /&gt;Caused my dermatitis to return (hadnt had issues in years)&lt;br /&gt;I have used a considerable amount of lotion in the past few months because my skin is extremely dry now that ive used this</li>
            <li> I love this product, its exactly what I was looking for.  I had been buying a product from a doctor for over $200 that had these ingredients in it.  I&#x27;m really happy that this is available and it works great.  The downside is the leaking during shipping issue.  I ordered two bottles, both leaked in shipping.  I actually received one bottles worth of the product.  They need to have a foil seal under the cap that we remove when we&#x27;re ready to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I emailed the company as instructed but never heard anything back from them.  I will order again because I still saved a lot of money, just two bottles to make sure I actually get enough to use for a while.</li>
            <li> Maxipeel:  It was suppose to peel off the dead skin, but it didn&#x27;t perform to expectation. i would not recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work with just 2 bottles. Only peeled a small amount of skin and then darken it a little. I might try the green oil peel.</li>
            <li> Not sure if having thicker skin prevents me from feeling burning sensations when using this peel but I do not have any. I have been using this peel for about 2 weeks now and it has significantly reduced my hyperpigmentation. I am acne prone and usually all my breakouts lead to hyperpigmentation. This thoroughly annoying. My quest for perfect/clear skin has had me using various peels and microdermabrasion but for the price I can not say others compare. This is a mild peel that can be used frequently but you must moisturize.</li>
            <li> Love this product. The only thing is that my skin was extra tight and uncomfortable before it started to peel. Good results in the end.</li>
            <li> used 1 bottle of maxi-peel #3, I never peeled not even a flake. Don&#x27;t waste your money buying this product. I don&#x27;t know what the girl on youtube used but it could not have been this maxi-peel.Got my money back on this product.</li>
            <li> It works great but I really should have only applied it for 2 days instead of 3. The skin on my face was a little dry and flaky but I didn&#x27;t think it was feeling and I didnt have any pain until the day after I had applied the 3rd time. I got out of the shower today and the skin on my face was really dry and stinging so be careful and make sure to moisturize and use sunblock when going out.</li>
            <li> this product was a waste of time and money  I did not see any results  waste of time and money</li>
            <li> I love this stuff it works faster than RX medication I have spent hundreds of dollars on, On the 3rd day I had peeling on my chin above my top lip and jaw area. This product dried my mild adult acne up within a week, it also lighten dark areas on my face within two weeks now my face is the same color as my chest. I shop at a oriental store twice a month and the other day when I was there I saw this product and it was only six dollars plus. They had No. 1,2 and 3 only so I bought two of each. so people check with your neighborhood oriental store because before, I had went to the store I placed a second order through amazon and the price had went up. I now have 12 bottles</li>
            <li> This is my second time using the maxi peel the first time I didn&#x27;t know what to expect but after addressing my concerns to thr seller he sent me another one. I just receive it yesterday and it came sealed to prevent spilling. And taped. I will give another review after I&#x27;m finished with this bottle.</li>
            <li> I heard so many great things about this product so I decided to buy used the entire bottle in one day an got no peeling</li>
            <li> I did not see any results and i followed the instructions to the letter. I was also very unhappy because when i opened it the seal was broken, actually there was no seal at all and a third of the content inside the bottle was already gone. It&#x27;s most likely that the seller gave me a watered down version of the product.</li>
            <li> Product very slow to send. It took about 3 weeks to get here. I had to change my travel plans about 4 days to wait for this stuff to get here. The manufacturers poorly contain the product, so it came nearly empty from leaking despite of the sellers trying to reinforce the packaging. The sellers were apologetic and sent new product to my home (at a different address) which was nice, but the product was a dark brown color this time. I later found out that meant the product had been exposed and was old. I wish I knew that before, because I had a TERRIBLE reaction to it. My skin burned and discolored badly. Thankfully, I have (very) tough skin and went to the doctor immediately. He prescribed some steroids that helped a lot because my skin is pretty resilient and the wounds were still pretty fresh. Today my skin is almost (keyword almost) back to normal, and i consider myself very lucky. If you have normal to sensitive skin in my situation, you would have been SCREWED! I got this stuff as recommended by a friend, and I regret it. I now know this stuff is illegal in 98% of the world. But America is not known for not being overly concerned about the health of its citizens. The almighty dollar rules here. This stuff is intended to be used long term - and long term, this stuff causes cancer. Soooooo.... its stupid to use this stuff. There are many, much more safe alternatives. Be safe. Do your research... It never occured for me to look this stuff up. If I wanted to bleach my skin, I&#x27;d have used bleach from my local dollar store already at my home.</li>
            <li> My skin start peeling after 3 days of using this product, and it hurts to re apply it again after it peel, and how long the peeling would last? Coz I peel like crazy. But it definitely works! It got red of my pimples and dark spots also makes your face clear and smooth.</li>
            <li> I did peel, but not a lot. from the reviews I read, I thought I would be peeling like a snake.It did help with the oiliness of my skin.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t peel very much and I&#x27;m still using it but it does help with acne and I suggest this for like a weekend peel also it makes u ou skin pinkish tone makes I look look younger I just don&#x27;t like to use hydro quinine everyday as it&#x27;s a chemical but I use kojic acid soap by koji San and that works seriously !!</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It does an excellent job of exfoliating and evening out my skin tone. I was also very impressed with how quickly the seller shipped out my product. My package got to me super fast! I am very happy with my purchase : )</li>
            <li> I didnt notice much peeling at all after days of use. no lightening effect. Just really doesn;t sem to work at all. i had a much better result just using a chemical peel</li>
            <li> I applied it to my body(stomach, legs and buttocks) while it was dry...waited 3 days before writing a review to see if  i see any results...my bottle was half empty so I don&#x27;t if it was suppose to have protection seal or not...I didn&#x27;t even a peel a little bit...</li>
            <li> Im a black female with hyperpigmentation on my jawline n i got this thinking it would help n it did nothin.so i went back and got A glycolic face peel 70% for like $14</li>
            <li> I can tell a difference in my skin with using maxi peel, but not an overnight amazingly result as others claim. I have been using it for a month now. I only apply it at bedtime every 2nights. I can say it does work.</li>
            <li> First time using it,it game me a good results but I had 2 wait abt 5 days for it to start peeling.I guess coz I never used it.overall I will buy it again n now my face is even n I love my new completion.thanx 2 my gal beaty siren she helped me out.check her video on how to apply this peel.</li>
            <li> I use this and it peeled me nicely. Took 3days to start peeling.  If u want something stronger n faster us lactic acid lotion the put maxi peel on. Youll peel next day</li>
            <li> First I will say that I like this product line.  This product works well BUT is not intended for long-term use.  In addition, I only gave it 3 stars because it has HQ.  If you want a product to quickly clear imperfections and for VERY short-term use then give it a try.</li>
            <li> I did not like the actual product, or how it was shipped to me. Considering this is a liquid solution, I was sure that it would be wrapped in bubble wrap or something to keep it secure. When I got it however, it was a box with the Maxi-peel exfoliant box inside of it... that&#x27;s it. The product had actually spilled inside of the box, and so half of it was already gone. Also there were no instructions to the use of the product in English, so I couldn&#x27;t understand anything the box said. I will not buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> RUINS YOUR SKIN DO NOT USE THIS STUFF,,, YOU WILL REGRET IT... BURNS YOUR SKIN AND IT WILL NEVER BE THE SAME</li>
            <li> This stuff really works! I am a 31 y/o African American woman. I was looking to see some results as everyone else stated in their review within 2 weeks, and I did see some results after the first week! I&#x27;ve been using it for a bout 4 weeks now and dark spots has faded and my skin has lightened a shade or so. Be careful for it will burn your skin. Only use once a day. I started out the first 2 days using twice a day and boy did it burn my skin cat wraggedy! But after a couple of days not using it at all, it got better. I have finished this bottle and now have gotten No 2. Great product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on this product for a month now and it really works.  It has minimized the sebum on my face, cleared up acne issues and I&#x27;m about a shade lighter.  I had minimal peeling but my face is smoother and clearer.  The price is a little high for the size of the bottle, but its worth the price based on my results.  Would buy and recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed. Didn&#x27;t peel my skin at all. Seemed like alcohol in a bottle. I used this product on multiple occasions. I was told by the seller that since my skin is &amp;#34;not sensitive&amp;#34; this product would not cause irritation to my skin, therefore my skin will not peel easily. I would also like to include that I am African American with a brown skin tone. Close skin tone to the woman who advertises this product on YouTube and swears by it. It worked for her but it didn&#x27;t work for me. Everyone is different, good luck. I hope I find something that works for me.</li>
            <li> I use it randomly.. it seems to work ok but I didn&#x27;t peel as deeply, perhaps I needed to use it daily.  Would I purchase it again, most likely.</li>
            <li> I was so skeptical about this product at first, but I tried it because it had a average of 5 stars, i love it! I used it on monday and tuesday. Today I am peeling in some areas ...alot on my face  and im a shade lighter ! my skin is smooth and even</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I needed. I applied as directed and the peeling started within four days. It kept peeling for the following 5 days. All I did was put aveeno moisturizer and that help with softening the skin and not look so flaky. The only issue I had was that it spilled in the packaging once I got it but I have enough for another 2 tries</li>
            <li> I purchased the maxi-peel from a seller to sent me the product ruined. It was a very dark brown burned color. That really made me mad because I was so eager to try it. The maxi peel should be a light yellow color. So now I have to send it back and buy it from a different seller. Also I dont believe to use the solo one hand pressure sprayer is good for the maxipeel. I think you should get the a cheap pray bottle from your beauty supply store or a perfume bottle. The solo sprayer comes out kind of in a heavy spray and will use up the solution much quicker, plus you can just buy the cheaper smaller plastic bottle for like .99 cents. I will post a review once I get my 2nd order of maxi peel in the mail.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t ever buy again, i contacted the seller telling them the issue i had and they did not reply, the liquid was very dark and cause my skin to burn, the seller seem like they don&#x27;t want to answer because they do not want to refund or give me a brand new one, and from what i read if the liquid is dark that means it is no good.</li>
            <li> It works on the third day !!! I love this product yes I now have a new look ..  I recommend this to people with skin issues or simple want to exfoliate ...</li>
            <li> I have been to the spa to get the expensive facial peels and have to say this works just as well. I usually start to peel anywhere from 2-3 days after I apply. Skin discoloration improves with each use!</li>
            <li> When I received this product I immediately ripped open the package took a shower and applied it to actually all over my body.  Yes yes yes I know I should of tested it on a small part of my skin.  Anyway I actually applied it 2 days in a row.  2 bottles each day.  How I applied it to my body was with the Solo 418 1-Liter One-Hand Pressure Sprayer.  I went on youtube and saw this woman called makeupmaverick give instructions on how she did it.  I know monkey see monkey do...but damnit her skin looks freakin great.  And It worked for me.  I have eczema all over my chest...well lets just say its not all over anymore because of this product. I wish I had taken before and after photos.  Now I still have more work to be done on my skin...but I will definitely purchase this product again...I have one bottle left.  Before I put this on my skin I used the belo soap ....the one without the kojic acid...I rinsed off and toweled dry.  I applied the product to my body like I said from before 2 days in a row. I air dried and then applied Vaseline to my skin.  The 2nd day I began to itch..when I itched I used hydrocortisone , by the 3rd day I began to peel all over like a snake. This lasted about 5 days for me.  I stayed out of the sun for a week while I peeled.  After the peeling stopped my skin was soooooooooo soft and smooth.  Also it has lightened my scars and stretch marks a lot.  Oh my gosh!!!  It was worth all that itching I went through.  Like my mom always told me if you want to be cute you gotta stand the pain.  I am actually using this product again right now.  Each time I useit,  it lightens the scars I have on my face and chest.  Love Love Love this product.  With that being said I understand everyone&#x27;s skin is different...so please use this product with caution...just because this worked for me and maybe some other women it might not work the same way for you.  Don&#x27;t do like I did and jump head first into using it....please test it on a small part of your skin.</li>
            <li> Although, I received this product very quickly,  it was packaged horribly. The bottle was not sealed in any plastic so over half of the liquid spilled out of the bottle. The remaining liquid was a dark brwon color so that lets me no the product was no good. What a waste of money. I will not be ordering anything from this seller again.</li>
            <li> Works well,exfoliate slowly so I can still go outside but with sunscreen of course. Saw inprovement in my skin with a week.</li>
            <li> this product worked wonderfully on my oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;it makes my skin feel smoother. the price was great.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be purchasing it again.</li>
            <li> The product wasn&#x27;t in the store packaging.  It had spilled all throughout the small plastic bag and envelope it was in. Sending this back.  There are no directions for it either as it wasn&#x27;t in its proper packaging.</li>
            <li> Got product for my daughter and she said it really worked for her she gives it a 5 star review</li>
            <li> Product has helped to balance skin tone. The exfoliation used with ProDerma worked well. Its worth trying. I recommend this product to help fix discolorations below the neck.</li>
            <li> It didnt make my skin peel. I used it for a about 2weeks and i Didn&#x27;t see any results at all.</li>
            <li> The bottle top had brown crust, the liquid has turned brown and this is straight out of the package on the first day I received it. I am extremely  disappointed!</li>
            <li> Using this  for 7 years. And it clear up my freckles. I just love how it fade my freckles and make my face soft and clear.</li>
            <li> love it. will reccimmend to anyom&#x3D;ne cant to wait for the night to do what i need thanks so much</li>
            <li> I do love it, I just wish the results were faster. I bought this twice already. It works just fine, though I wish they had #4 &amp;#62;.&amp;#60;</li>
