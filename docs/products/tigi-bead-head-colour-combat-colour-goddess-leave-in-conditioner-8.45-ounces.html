            <li>I absolutely love the smell.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT.</li>

            <li>great leaves my hair soft and smelling great fast service</li>
            <li>This leave in conditioner is easy to use and smells fantastic!  </li>
            <li>This leave in conditioner makes my hair soft, healthy and smells great.</li>
            <li>great so far!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the smell of this product and keeps my hair smooth.</li>
            <li>it works, leaving hair soft, shiny,combable and smelling great.  </li>
            <li>I love the brunette goddess shampoo/conditioner, so I was excited when I saw they make this leave in conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I have shoulder length fine hair.</li>
            <li>I bought this mostly for the smell (I bought it elsewhere the first time), which is kinda of a butterscotch/caramel smell, and for the claims...</li>
            <li>Pretty sure this was cloudy water.</li>
            <li>I almost smells like fresh cookies or maybe cake!</li>
            <li>Mmmmm, smells like fresh baked cookies!  </li>
            <li>Mostly bought for the smell though haha.</li>
            <li>Only good thing was the smell of it.</li>
            <li>that smells good enough to overlook that I didn&#x27;t wash it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s something sweet, like vanilla or honey.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Luckily, a bit of window cleaner fixes that.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for little girls to remove tangles.</li>
            <li>I love the way my hair feels and looks when I use this -- soft and a bit</li>
            <li>My color lasts do much longer and is way more vibrant plus.....</li>
            <li>I am light blonde and it gave me a nice, soft, bouncy effect.</li>
            <li>So if you don&#x27;t like strong scents I would probably steer clear of this.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>so it can last me a while :)</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo especially the smell of it!</li>
            <li>very nice smell; not too watery; but not too thick like a mousse.</li>
            <li>i recommend this product, especially if you want your hair to have a sweet smell to it!</li>
            <li>Smells good, great for colored hair, easy to get a brush through my mess of hair after a few small sprays.</li>
            <li>It made my hair much more tangled and dry feeling.</li>
            <li>You get a decent size bottle with bed head and the smell!  </li>
            <li>I have curly hair and this conditioner really makes it manageable and shiny.  </li>
            <li>I find my hair shines more and is much more managable for several days, than when I would use the regular condtioner of this same line.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it enough to determine whether it&#x27;s &amp;#34;just for brunet/brunette(s)&amp;#34; title is valid for anything, but as a leave in conditioner, I really enjoy using this product.</li>
            <li>But I feel like since using this my hair is so much healthier.</li>
            <li>For now I am using it only on the underside of my hair, where its&#x27; dryng effects is not so bothersome, just so I can use it and enjoy the fragrance, but  I will not re-purchase this.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing, that&#x27;s for sure, but it leaves my hair feeling very weird.</li>
            <li>Reason enough to use it right there.</li>
            <li>I have fine, dark brown hair that gets weighed down easily.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many before, this is certainly not authentic.</li>
            <li>my 4 year old calls it her Candy Spray.  </li>
            <li>It keeps my hair soft and the color in.</li>
            <li>But it makes my hair sooo shiny and extremely soft.</li>
            <li>Add a little for the conditioning, but if you add a little more, it gives your hair some texture without the weight.  </li>
            <li>(I have long medium-thickness naturally curly hair.)</li>
            <li>Blow dry for a soft manageable style.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair and it tends to be very dry.</li>

            <li> I have naturally curly hair and it tends to be very dry.</li>
            <li> hair is color-treated and was pretty damaged -- hard to comb.  </li>
            <li> and it last a long time thankyou</li>
            <li> So basically i need a conditioner for my ends when it&#x27;s dry the next day,</li>
            <li> Much less costly here, than from my local salon.</li>
            <li> it says its for red hair or brunettes, and i have black hair</li>
            <li> Just be careful where you are standing when you spay it.</li>
            <li> Definitely not real Bed Head product -</li>
            <li> Not what I expected from a leave-in conditioner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d tried other leave-ins that left my hair feeling crunchy, or oily &amp; limp.  </li>
            <li> And now they&#x27;ve a leave-in conditioner that conditions without weighing your hair down.</li>
            <li> and it also holds my poofy afro like hair down</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s subtle, but if you give a flip of your hair you can definitely smell it.</li>
            <li> Total rip-off.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it dried my hair a lot, and the bottle doesn&#x27;t say anything about it offering heat styling protection, as I thought it did.  </li>
            <li> This made my hair feel really dry and unhealthy.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it&#x27;s past the return window of this product for me</li>
            <li> Made my hair sticky even with a small amount.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a sucker for that :</li>
            <li> When I go out with this, I worry  that the people around me are going to think that I sloppily smothered some dessert on my hair by mistake or that just plainly I am a slob.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually rate hair care products, as the majority of them ones I&#x27;ve tried are mediocre.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little disappointed</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t vouch for long term color protection since I just bought it, but I&#x27;ve never been disappointed by a BedHead product!</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll never go wrong with Tigi Bed Head products.</li>
            <li> This smell is sooooo WRONG for hair.</li>
            <li> Not happy at all with product!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t rate this based on how well it preserves hair color, as my hair color fades like crazy no matter what.</li>
            <li> , I feel sick that it is on my hair.</li>
            <li> I hate the smell of this.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

            <li> My stylist used this on me at her salon. I absolutely love the smell. It also worked great on my highlighted hair. I am light blonde and it gave me a nice, soft, bouncy effect. LOVE IT. Just bought some to use at home. Did I mention the smell?? My husband can&#x27;t get enough of it. Reason enough to use it right there. ;)</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the smell of this product and keeps my hair smooth. Mostly bought for the smell though haha.</li>
            <li> Got some for a gift. Loved it &amp; Amazon had the best price!</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t that great. Smells awesome but not moisturizing enough for my curly hair.</li>
            <li> Smells good, great for colored hair, easy to get a brush through my mess of hair after a few small sprays.</li>
            <li> made my hair more brittle than it already was. Only good thing was the smell of it.</li>
            <li> Love this product! It smells great and works even better.</li>
            <li> I love the brunette goddess shampoo/conditioner, so I was excited when I saw they make this leave in conditioner.  I needed a leave in cond. because since I dye my hair, I can&#x27;t wash it every day.  So basically i need a conditioner for my ends when it&#x27;s dry the next day, that smells good enough to overlook that I didn&#x27;t wash it.  You get a decent size bottle with bed head and the smell!  It&#x27;s awesome, almost like cookies or something real yummy!  I&#x27;m a little disappointed cause I bought it else where so I over paid for it, but  will buy here In the future to save some money.</li>
            <li> I bought this mostly for the smell (I bought it elsewhere the first time), which is kinda of a butterscotch/caramel smell, and for the claims...yeah, and the art.  I&#x27;m a sucker for that :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But...I love what it does for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is color-treated and was pretty damaged -- hard to comb.  I&#x27;d tried other leave-ins that left my hair feeling crunchy, or oily &amp; limp.  I love the way my hair feels and looks when I use this -- soft and a bit bouncy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be buying this again.</li>
            <li> Well. I am platinum blonde, and this formula is for brunettes and red heads. I wish that had been included in the item description as this will just turn my platinum locks brassy. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair and this conditioner really makes it manageable and shiny.  Just be careful where you are standing when you spay it. It made my bathroom floor quite slippery. Luckily, a bit of window cleaner fixes that.</li>
            <li> Pretty sure this was cloudy water. It made my hair much more tangled and dry feeling. Total rip-off. Definitely not real Bed Head product - I&#x27;ve used many before, this is certainly not authentic.</li>
            <li> Love this!  The smell is great and it is light and doesn&#x27;t flake or anything.  Add a little for the conditioning, but if you add a little more, it gives your hair some texture without the weight.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Smells great.  I always get complimented on the smell of it.  It seems to work well as a conditioner and ant-frizz as well.</li>
            <li> works great - love the smell.  my 4 year old calls it her Candy Spray.  We use this all the time and we have given it as a gift.</li>
            <li> very nice smell; not too watery; but not too thick like a mousse. I find my hair shines more and is much more managable for several days, than when I would use the regular condtioner of this same line. Much less costly here, than from my local salon.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll never go wrong with Tigi Bed Head products. And now they&#x27;ve a leave-in conditioner that conditions without weighing your hair down. I have fine, dark brown hair that gets weighed down easily. This yummy stuff scents your hair with the mouth-watering flavor of caramel. I haven&#x27;t used it enough to determine whether it&#x27;s &amp;#34;just for brunet/brunette(s)&amp;#34; title is valid for anything, but as a leave in conditioner, I really enjoy using this product.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It keeps my hair soft and the color in. And it smells amazing!!!</li>
            <li> I use this product in place of a traditional conditioner. It saves time, works well and smells great. I have shoulder length fine hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually rate hair care products, as the majority of them ones I&#x27;ve tried are mediocre. This one stands out above the rest. I have so many serums, creams, leave-in&#x27;s, etc..This one is the best. It even beats argan oil, in my opinion. I can&#x27;t rate this based on how well it preserves hair color, as my hair color fades like crazy no matter what. But it makes my hair sooo shiny and extremely soft. And I love the smell, it smells like caramel I think. So if you don&#x27;t like strong scents I would probably steer clear of this. But I feel like since using this my hair is so much healthier. And it&#x27;s not too pricey. Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> This leave in conditioner is easy to use and smells fantastic!  It is a nice spray that I use each night before bed.</li>
            <li> Leave-in Conditioner does not leave hair feeling greasy or sticky. Just spritz on damp hair and comb in. Blow dry for a soft manageable style.</li>
            <li> Love this product!!  Wouldn&#x27;t be without it.</li>
            <li> I do see a difference in my hair color, it seems to be shinier and the smell afterwards is amazing. It&#x27;s subtle, but if you give a flip of your hair you can definitely smell it. It&#x27;s something sweet, like vanilla or honey.&lt;br /&gt;It was just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> What can I say?  it works, leaving hair soft, shiny,combable and smelling great.  The scent is the bottom line. I almost smells like fresh cookies or maybe cake!</li>
            <li> I love this product wish I could  find the shampoo and conditioner for a great deal too.thank you Cami lewis</li>
            <li> I hate the smell of this. It basically smells like brown sugar brownies. While that might be good to eat, everytime I spray this  on my hair, I feel sick that it is on my hair. When I go out with this, I worry  that the people around me are going to think that I sloppily smothered some dessert on my hair by mistake or that just plainly I am a slob. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s past the return window of this product for me so I&#x27;m going to have to suck it up. This smell is sooooo WRONG for hair.</li>
            <li> Mmmmm, smells like fresh baked cookies!  Oh yeah, and it helps to condition my hair too!  I love it!</li>
            <li> makes your hair feel like plastic! Not happy at all with product!</li>
            <li> Love it! My color lasts do much longer and is way more vibrant plus..... It smells like caramel !!!</li>
            <li> This made my hair feel really dry and unhealthy. Not what I expected from a leave-in conditioner.</li>
            <li> i just recieved this product today and i just love it!! it says its for red hair or brunettes, and i have black hair but i just got it for the smell and it also holds my poofy afro like hair down so i think its amazing!!! i love it and the amount is just perfect i ordered 4 of them so it can last me a while :)i recommend this product, especially if you want your hair to have a sweet smell to it!</li>
            <li> Had a brown sugar type smell but - a burnt brown sugar smell.  Made my hair sticky even with a small amount.</li>
            <li> First and foremost, as others have said, the smell of this product is amazing!!! It&#x27;s like a cross between caramel and butterscotch! I can&#x27;t vouch for long term color protection since I just bought it, but I&#x27;ve never been disappointed by a BedHead product! It has worked (and smelled) great so far!</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo especially the smell of it!</li>
            <li> I bought this and the matching shampoo/conditioner because my stylist used it on me and it smells heavenly. Unfortunately it dried my hair a lot, and the bottle doesn&#x27;t say anything about it offering heat styling protection, as I thought it did.  For now I am using it only on the underside of my hair, where its&#x27; dryng effects is not so bothersome, just so I can use it and enjoy the fragrance, but  I will not re-purchase this.</li>
            <li> Smells good and works great!!</li>
            <li> I love this product! I have naturally curly hair and it tends to be very dry. This leave in conditioner makes my hair soft, healthy and smells great.</li>
            <li> works great smells great leaves my hair soft and smelling great fast service and it last a long time thankyou</li>
            <li> Works and smells wonderful.  It&#x27;s great for little girls to remove tangles.</li>
            <li> It smells amazing, that&#x27;s for sure, but it leaves my hair feeling very weird. Kind of feels like there&#x27;s some kind of build-up on it and makes me feel like I need to wash all over again. I don&#x27;t love it. (I have long medium-thickness naturally curly hair.)</li>
