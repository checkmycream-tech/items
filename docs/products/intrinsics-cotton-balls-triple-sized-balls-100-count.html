            <li>I needed cotton balls to clean carbon steel knives.</li>
            <li>These organic cotton balls are nice enough.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re soft and dense, so they will be okay, but will not buy again.</li>
            <li>I use them for shining my shoes, and of all of the cotton balls I have used, I think these are near the top.</li>

            <li>Price seems a bit high</li>
            <li>Cotton balls are ok, a little pricey.</li>

            <li>These cotton balls are soft and clean, as well as tightly spun.</li>
            <li>$6.00 for one bag of cotton and the quality is no better than the last pack of cotton I purchased (3x as many cotton balls)</li>
            <li>Like the other reviewer said, these cotton balls are two or three times the size of normal cotton balls that you get at the drug store.</li>
            <li>They definitely seem high quality, but the cotton is definitely dense and not as &amp;#34;fluffy&amp;#34; as other cotton balls I&#x27;ve used.  </li>

            <li> Please know that I do not &amp;#34;hate&amp;#34; this product-good product just a very SMALL bag compared to what is displayed in this picture.</li>
            <li> Bought these to shine my shoes which these cotton balls were not ideal for.</li>

            <li> These organic cotton balls are nice enough.  They definitely seem high quality, but the cotton is definitely dense and not as &amp;#34;fluffy&amp;#34; as other cotton balls I&#x27;ve used.  Still a good product.</li>
            <li> Please know that I do not &amp;#34;hate&amp;#34; this product-good product just a very SMALL bag compared to what is displayed in this picture. In no way does the picture represent the bag because the product is smaller. This picture makes it seem like it is one of those JUMBO bags and it isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> These are large, thick and soft cotton balls. Like the other reviewer said, these cotton balls are two or three times the size of normal cotton balls that you get at the drug store. They are very absorbent and hold up well when moistened. I know they are a little more expensive than the cheap ones typically available, but I find they preform much better than any other cotton balls I&#x27;ve been able to find locally.</li>
            <li> great product and fast, free shipping</li>

            <li> Nice cotton balls, very absorbent, and does not separate into tiny pieces that attach to your face etc.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll buy these again.  They&#x27;re cotton balls at a good price with the convenience of Amazon.</li>

            <li> These cotton balls are just so great, they are very useful in all ways possible, cleaning or healing wounds or whatever, these cotton balls are really worth my money</li>
            <li> What can I say, as advertised.  They are Cotton balls.  They are soft.  They are cheap.</li>
            <li> Fantastic value for the price!</li>
            <li> These cotton balls are VERY dense. I use mine to apply toner but I&#x27;m sure you could use them for a variety of things. I actually pulled mine apart to get more use out of them.</li>
            <li> These are cotton balls . . . what is there to say about cotton balls?  they are soft, and somewhat round, but not perfectly round.  They are cotton ball round.  They work great for applying witch hazel to sensitive skin.  Would also be good for Easter craft projects.</li>
            <li> Yay it&#x27;s cotton. It&#x27;s fluffy. And absorbent.</li>
            <li> Use for nail polish removal. Work great!</li>
            <li> I needed cotton balls to clean carbon steel knives. The balls were dipped in a hot mild acid bath and rubbed into the blades with tongs. If you have this problem or a similar problem needing absorbent cotton balls, this is the one to use.</li>
            <li> seem fine but too expensive for the little bag.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cotton balls people..</li>
            <li> These are tiny compared to cotton balls I&#x27;m used to using for cosmetics and nail polish removal.  They&#x27;re soft and dense, so they will be okay, but will not buy again.</li>
            <li> The best money can buy.</li>
            <li> Now that&#x27;s a lot of balls ;)</li>

            <li> This is much more expensive per ball than at your local drug chain, but you are getting extremely dense cotton balls. Each ball has is like 2-3 normal cotton balls condensed into one, and I usually rip each one in half before use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, they&#x27;re regular, white cotton balls.</li>
            <li> They are what you would expect from a bag of cotton balls.</li>
            <li> Ok, just too expensive, I should have shopped around more, the drug store has these for $3.99.. For 200!</li>
            <li> Really nice cotton, i like mine dense.</li>
            <li> Cotton balls are ok, a little pricey.</li>
            <li> Price seems a bit high</li>
            <li> Very soft and right size!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a too big since i use it for skin care purposes</li>
