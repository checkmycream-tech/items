            <li>So happy to have found this product for a reasonable product.</li>
            <li>, I love it and it works too</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I had this on hand</li>
            <li>It worked great!&lt;br /&gt;It was refreshing on my dust-sore throat.</li>
            <li>Love it and use in mebulizer at night to help with my asthma and also on my head for migraines.</li>
            <li>Love this blend.</li>
            <li>but ok I guess.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>love this.</li>
            <li>If I use more than one drop in mist diffuser</li>
            <li>I also like an additional label on the top of the bottle.</li>
            <li>Love this company.</li>
            <li>it just whiffs through the filter to help me breath better</li>
            <li>I love plant therapy EO&#x27;s and order them almost exclusively.</li>
            <li>I bought this to try to help both of them get a better night&#x27;s sleep.  </li>
            <li>I love this oil...</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the way this smells.</li>
            <li>Love ‚ù§</li>
            <li>I love how they explain EVERYTHING on their website.</li>
            <li>, I should have known better.</li>
            <li>So glad I found this brand of oils that offers good quality without jacked up prices!</li>
            <li>Great product,  enjoying it with my new diffuser.</li>
            <li>I can easily find this remedy among others  bottles of oils.  </li>
            <li>It works but feels not so strong.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve noticed a HUGE difference in my congestion and stuffiness.</li>
            <li>This blend of essential oils has been very nice to have in conjunction with my humidifier at night.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li>Thankful that I found Plant Therapy early on, because the prices and service are amazing.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like it quite as well as Breathe, but still, it is very helpful at night in the atomizer, helps us sleep better through the night, without waking up</li>
            <li>Love it and really helps my breathing at night.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like paying a lot for my essential oils, because it can get pricey, BUT on the flip side, I do want good quality oils.</li>
            <li>It gave it this greasy cleaning product sense rather than fresh clean and opening to my sinuses.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping and item was just as described.  </li>
            <li>Plant therapy oils are a great quality at a great price and this blend seems to help in cold season.</li>
            <li>The product always arrives quickly and well packaged.</li>
            <li>Great blend, worked really well for my recent bout with the flu.</li>
            <li>and it seems to help keep me from being so stuffed up and congested in the morning, even more so than the high dollar allergy medication my doctor recommended.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite Plant Therapy blend so far!</li>
            <li>I wish it has a little bit of oregano to make it more effective.</li>
            <li>We actually enjoy the scent as we fall asleep, it&#x27;s very calming.</li>
            <li>I think I may be addicted to this wonderful blend.  </li>
            <li>I love this brand, no hidden facts just what I ordered.</li>
            <li>I loved it so much, and have been using it so much, that I purchased a bigger bottle of it.</li>
            <li>A person certainly could blend their own essential oil synergy for this purpose, but I find the price and convenience of this blend unbeatable.</li>
            <li>Labeling on the top of the cap makes it easy to find amongst other medicine and vitamin bottles.</li>
            <li>Helps my sinuses to stay open and therefore allowing my breathing to happen with more ease.</li>
            <li>Smells more medicinal than concoction I make with the same ingredients.  </li>
            <li>So comforting and helps so much!</li>
            <li>For application on the skin we use a carrier oil and test first, because some of these oils are &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>It has helped sooo much!</li>
            <li>Love my essential oils!</li>
            <li>Excellent product for significantly less than some of the more expensive, well-known brands with just as good, if not better quality.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to essential oils, so I wasn&#x27;t sure what would come of it.....</li>
            <li>very yummy smell</li>
            <li>Really works well with my humidifier and breathing at night.</li>
            <li>I have asthma and it really helps to rub this on my chest</li>
            <li>My husband has lots of allergies and this really seems to work.</li>
            <li>Very soothing when you are congested.</li>
            <li>My husband thanks you...</li>
            <li>fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Really helps with my allergies.</li>
            <li>They seem to have integrity when it comes to their products and their name, and I really appreciate that.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>i was very unimpressed with this one, and won&#x27;t be buy from this brand again.  </li>
            <li>We live in Georgia and when Spring begins, I diffuse this!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used essential oils for years and have tried many different brands.  </li>
            <li>This product is very comparable to Young Livings R.C.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s midnight and my twin 1 year old boys wake up very congested.  </li>
            <li>Powerful, cleansing, essential oil;</li>
            <li>This was perfect for when we were all sick .</li>
            <li>what the heck...let me fetch this new oil</li>
            <li>but seriously this oil is amazing..</li>
            <li>Calmed them down, cleared them up, and sent them right off into a peaceful sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not sure what proportions they use of each eo, but it leaves a more astringent scent.</li>
            <li>so much easier instantly.  </li>
            <li>Much like vicks it definitely works!!</li>
            <li>Really helps open up those nasal passages!</li>
            <li>As the sickness is finally leaving our house, when I put this in our diffuser you would really tell a difference with everyone&#x27;s sniffles.</li>
            <li>IMMEDIATELY I felt I could take a full breath, and also noticed my tendency to cough had calmed down a lot.</li>
            <li>, I certainly wish I had discovered essential oils earlier in my life!</li>
            <li>Priced less than many other comparable products.</li>
            <li>Great oil, especially during the cold and flu season.  </li>
            <li>Plant therapy offers same therapeutic grade as Young Living at a fraction of the cost.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not quite sure what to do with it now, but at least I didn&#x27;t spend an arm and a leg to try it out!</li>
            <li>Could not speak a complete sentence without taking a breath in the middle of it!</li>
            <li>I will also add a few drops to a hot bath or diffuse it in their room</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I will also add a few drops to a hot bath or diffuse it in their room</li>
            <li> I put a few drops in a mug of very hot water, and took a few breaths.</li>
            <li> and I start sneezing, I apply a little directly under my nose and on my cheekbones (don&#x27;t get it too close to your eyes!)</li>
            <li> I have purchased this to replace the Doterra Breathe (which I love and used with my daughter for sore throat and cold).</li>
            <li> Not only does it open my lungs up when they feel tight, but it kept all those dry coughs at bay.  </li>
            <li> Got this for Burning Man and put a little on the back of my dust mask to help with the massive dust inhalation.</li>
            <li> It arrived three days earlier than expected!</li>
            <li> I have dry skin</li>

            <li> recovery time is also half....</li>
            <li> This is the first cold I&#x27;ve had where I&#x27;ve had Respir-Aid on hand, so I decided to give it a try before reaching for my asthma inhaler.</li>
            <li> I can go to sleep tonight because my little ones did.  </li>
            <li> I apply a little the bottom of their feet in a carrier oil then put socks on.</li>

            <li> We&#x27;ve been using it in diffusers, for a nagging cold that has knocked our family down.</li>
            <li> We put it in our diffusers, and apply to the soles of feet, the throat, and behind the ears.  </li>
            <li> Put this on my chest and neck when I was sick and having trouble breathing.  </li>
            <li> It smells divine and really helped through the terrible chest cold that I had.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Quick shipping and item was just as described.  Very happy to add this oil to my collection.</li>
            <li> Great product. So happy to have found this product for a reasonable product.</li>
            <li> very yummy smell, I love it and it works too</li>
            <li> It works but feels not so strong. I wish it has a little bit of oregano to make it more effective.</li>
            <li> Great product,  enjoying it with my new diffuser.</li>
            <li> This was perfect for when we were all sick . Smells great too</li>
            <li> I am addicted to this stuff! Super good smell. Apply it on my feet, diluted on my chest and even diffused it in my room. I am always that person who is getting sick but this has helped immensely!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT ! Really works well with my humidifier and breathing at night.</li>
            <li> Put this on my chest and neck when I was sick and having trouble breathing.  Holy snaps amazing!  I could breathe so much easier instantly.  I&#x27;m so glad I had this on hand, I&#x27;m not sure I would have made it to the hospital that night otherwise.</li>
            <li> This smells like Pinesol to me.</li>
            <li> Got this for Burning Man and put a little on the back of my dust mask to help with the massive dust inhalation. It worked great!&lt;br /&gt;It was refreshing on my dust-sore throat. Totally taking it next year.</li>
            <li> This stuff is wonderful! I know it&#x27;s supposed to be for clearing you up, but I use it for those horrible itchy allergies. If my eyes/nose start itching and I start sneezing, I apply a little directly under my nose and on my cheekbones (don&#x27;t get it too close to your eyes!) and I&#x27;m good. Great stuff! Plus, if you&#x27;re a little stressed a deep inhale of this calms me down. Love it!</li>
            <li> I have asthma and it really helps to rub this on my chest</li>
            <li> This product is very comparable to Young Livings R.C. I would recommend this to anyone. And it much less expensive.</li>
            <li> Love it and use in mebulizer at night to help with my asthma and also on my head for migraines. I keep in my purse and nightstand and use all the time.</li>
            <li> I would give this 10 starts if I could!! Best thing that ever to happened to our marriage :) just kidding.. but seriously this oil is amazing.. my husband snores a lot and this helps reduce it almost 90% !! I can finally sleep without ear plugs! Will be stocking up on this!</li>
            <li> Love this blend. Plant therapy oils are a great quality at a great price and this blend seems to help in cold season. I&#x27;ve diffused this a few times and bought the roll on version also. Seems to help with cold symptoms.</li>
            <li> Blend is very pleasant and does aid in decongesting without being overpowering. I placed several drops in baking soda in a jar next to my bed for overnight relief and do feel I get it. It does not interfere with other blends.</li>
            <li> It does what it sets out to do.</li>
            <li> I just wish I had bought a larger size.This product stops a sinus headache before it gets started. Nothing else has ever worked like this for me. I made a second order today for a larger size.</li>
            <li> Pleasant smell.  Helps my sinuses to stay open and therefore allowing my breathing to happen with more ease.</li>
            <li> My husband has lots of allergies and this really seems to work.</li>
            <li> We use this for stuffy&lt;br /&gt; noses.. For adults and children.</li>
            <li> It helps me breathe and helps me not snore!!!!</li>
            <li> Purchase was for my daughter and she loves it.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t compare to doTerra brand but ok I guess.</li>
            <li> This blend of essential oils has been very nice to have in conjunction with my humidifier at night. I have dry skin and my husband suffers from allergies. This product is helping with both of our ailments. It has a medicinal scent, but it&#x27;s not overwhelming. We actually enjoy the scent as we fall asleep, it&#x27;s very calming.</li>
            <li> I put it in my diffuser at night and no more snoring from my husband üòîthat  means a good night sleep for me</li>
            <li> Plant therapy offers same therapeutic grade as Young Living at a fraction of the cost.  Will re-purchase this product as needed</li>
            <li> Smells more medicinal than concoction I make with the same ingredients.  Not sure what proportions they use of each eo, but it leaves a more astringent scent.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this to replace the Doterra Breathe (which I love and used with my daughter for sore throat and cold). She rubbed it in her chest, patted it on her cheekbones (sinus cavities) and diffused while resting and sleeping. Without using anything else, her cold and sore throat that was coming on was cleared up by day 2! So, I have replaced the Breathe with this in hopes of the same results should we need its use!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months now and it really seems to help with my allergies and nighttime congestion.  I&#x27;ve been struggling with allergies this year and it seems to help keep me from being so stuffed up and congested in the morning, even more so than the high dollar allergy medication my doctor recommended.  Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> Smells great. Very soothing when you are congested.</li>
            <li> Love this. Cuts my son&#x27;s junky chest symptoms in half...recovery time is also half....love this.</li>
            <li> I use this blend in my Ultrasonic Aromatherapy Essential Oil Diffuser.  It has a very pleasant and invigorating smell, and it does help me to breathe easier.</li>
            <li> Woke up this morning with an annoying cough and shortness of breath -- this is what happens when I come down with a cold. Could not speak a complete sentence without taking a breath in the middle of it! This is the first cold I&#x27;ve had where I&#x27;ve had Respir-Aid on hand, so I decided to give it a try before reaching for my asthma inhaler. I put a few drops in a mug of very hot water, and took a few breaths. IMMEDIATELY I felt I could take a full breath, and also noticed my tendency to cough had calmed down a lot. Remembering all of the nasty coughs (with breathing difficulty) I&#x27;ve had, I certainly wish I had discovered essential oils earlier in my life! Thankful that I found Plant Therapy early on, because the prices and service are amazing. A person certainly could blend their own essential oil synergy for this purpose, but I find the price and convenience of this blend unbeatable. **Some asthmatics experience worsening of symptoms when exposed to eucalyptus, so your mileage may vary.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s midnight and my twin 1 year old boys wake up very congested.  My husband and I stumble to their cribs and look at each other exhaustingly, knowing we were going to be in it for the long haul.  I&#x27;m desperate, knowing I have a long day at work tomorrow.  I figured, what the heck...let me fetch this new oil I just bought and put some drops in the diffuser I keep in their room.  I&#x27;m new to essential oils, so I wasn&#x27;t sure what would come of it.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well.....I&#x27;ll.....be.....damned.  It worked almost instantly.  Calmed them down, cleared them up, and sent them right off into a peaceful sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So thank you Plant Therapy.....I can go to sleep tonight because my little ones did.  My husband thanks you...and my employees and clients will thank you tomorrow.  Off the sleep for me...</li>
            <li> Good product. Labeling on the top of the cap makes it easy to find amongst other medicine and vitamin bottles. Why doesn&#x27;t every company do this?</li>
            <li> Maybe my husband has become use to my blend for his congestion. That&#x27;s the only reason I can think of as to why this didn&#x27;t phase him at all :-(</li>
            <li> I use this all the time. As a chest rub for my kids, in my diffuser, even mixed with epsom salts for the bath.</li>
            <li> Love this!! We live in Georgia and when Spring begins, I diffuse this! So comforting and helps so much! I use it in a roll on too!</li>
            <li> It clears but is very harsh. If I use more than one drop in mist diffuser my daughter and I are both choking.</li>
            <li> Works! Much like vicks it definitely works!!</li>
            <li> I got what I was looking for. Good cough suppressant. I also like an additional label on the top of the bottle. I can easily find this remedy among others  bottles of oils.  Everything is done with care and professionalism.</li>
            <li> Powerful, cleansing, essential oil; heavy on mint aromas, big, big fan! Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Very pleasant smell. Great price. We feel it helps with allergy sinuses when diffused at night for two hours.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would be comparable to doTERRA&#x27;s Breathe Respiratory Blend, but unfortunately it simply doesn&#x27;t work as well for my husband&#x27;s congestion issues. I&#x27;m not quite sure what to do with it now, but at least I didn&#x27;t spend an arm and a leg to try it out!</li>
            <li> I think I may be addicted to this wonderful blend.  It smells divine and really helped through the terrible chest cold that I had.  Not only does it open my lungs up when they feel tight, but it kept all those dry coughs at bay.  This is my favorite Plant Therapy blend so far!</li>
            <li> Great aroma and it clears the sinus. I will buy again</li>
            <li> Great EO. I love this brand, no hidden facts just what I ordered. fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I personally have HORRENDOUS seasonal allergies. I&#x27;ve struggled with them all my life! I put a few drops of this in my Greenair Mist Therapy while I&#x27;m sleeping and I&#x27;ve noticed a HUGE difference in my congestion and stuffiness. Really helps open up those nasal passages! I also keeps the bottle in my purse in case I need to take a whiff throughout the day. Plant Therapy makes some great quality oils!! Love this company.</li>
            <li> The scent of this blend is great and absolutely perfect for clearing up sinuses and nasal congestion. So glad I found this brand of oils that offers good quality without jacked up prices!</li>
            <li> I use it in connection with my C-Pap at night as aroma therapy and it just whiffs through the filter to help me breath better</li>
            <li> I got this as an alternative to DoTerra&#x27;s Breathe formula. I don&#x27;t like it quite as well as Breathe, but still, it is very helpful at night in the atomizer, helps us sleep better through the night, without waking up totally stuffed up. I also mixed it with fractionated coconut oil, put it in a roll-on applicator and use it during the daytime, to help open sinuses (we all have Mountain Cedar allergies).</li>
            <li> I love plant therapy EO&#x27;s and order them almost exclusively. Excellent product for significantly less than some of the more expensive, well-known brands with just as good, if not better quality. The respir-aid is on of my favorites for the sniffles and colds my kids bring home. I apply a little the bottom of their feet in a carrier oil then put socks on. I will also add a few drops to a hot bath or diffuse it in their room but regardless, it always helps loosen chest congestion or difficulty breathing. The product always arrives quickly and well packaged.</li>
            <li> Hubby had started snoring as of late, and my daughter has major sinus issues.  I bought this to try to help both of them get a better night&#x27;s sleep.  It seems to be helping, and the smell is pleasant.</li>
            <li> Love it and really helps my breathing at night.</li>
            <li> Great oil, especially during the cold and flu season.  We put it in our diffusers, and apply to the soles of feet, the throat, and behind the ears.  For application on the skin we use a carrier oil and test first, because some of these oils are &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Helps with my son&#x27;s asthma.</li>
            <li> Great product. Use it in my warmer and have made inhalers.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the lemon, makes it feel like a cleaning product. I bought this to help with my chronic sinus issues and to hopefully help restore my sense of smell. Yes, I don&#x27;t have a sense of smell and the lemon still bothered me. It gave it this greasy cleaning product sense rather than fresh clean and opening to my sinuses.</li>
            <li> Really helps with my allergies.</li>
            <li> I love this oil...yesterday I had a sinus headache, so I put a drop on a cotton ball and deeply inhaled it all day..also use it in  armotherapy also.</li>
            <li> we are a huge plant therapy fan!</li>
            <li> Use it with humidifier and it smells great.</li>
            <li> I like to diffuse this when I&#x27;m stopped up.  It does help open up my sinuses.</li>
            <li> Got us through cold and flu season like a champ!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the way this smells. As the sickness is finally leaving our house, when I put this in our diffuser you would really tell a difference with everyone&#x27;s sniffles. Love ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è</li>
            <li> This was one of the first oils I purchased from the Plant Therapy brand, and I must say, I am VERY impressed. I don&#x27;t like paying a lot for my essential oils, because it can get pricey, BUT on the flip side, I do want good quality oils. This brand has good quality oils AND affordable pricing. I love how they explain EVERYTHING on their website. They seem to have integrity when it comes to their products and their name, and I really appreciate that.&lt;br /&gt;This particular oil synergy is VERY good at opening up the airways. We&#x27;ve been using it in diffusers, for a nagging cold that has knocked our family down. It has helped sooo much! Brought us comfort while our bodies fight the virus. And made it easier to breathe. I loved it so much, and have been using it so much, that I purchased a bigger bottle of it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used essential oils for years and have tried many different brands.  i was very unimpressed with this one, and won&#x27;t be buy from this brand again.  I guess you get what you pay for, I should have known better.</li>
            <li> Great blend, worked really well for my recent bout with the flu. I used it in a vaporizer next to my bed.</li>
            <li> Quality oils with a pleasant scent. I used them in a diffuser and also place several drops on my vaccum filters to freshen the air during cleaning. The products arrived on time.  Priced less than many other comparable products.</li>
            <li> Love my essential oils!</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this blend. It arrived three days earlier than expected! Using it this evening and enjoying the benefits of these great oils.</li>
