            <li> great price and product</li>
            <li> Only conditioner I use and have for years.</li>
            <li> This is the best conditioner EVER! I have very fine hair and this product gives my hair body without any heavy residue. So sad Neutrogena won&#x27;t be carrying this any longer. Wish they&#x27;d bring it back!</li>
            <li> So I was once a hairdresser so I have access to all sorts and every kind of shampoo and conditoner known to man. I stumbled on this by accident on vacation. Now it is all my daughters use and I often do also. We all have some sort of color or another in our hair.  The price is terrific and it is always in our shower. This is a rare find, I hope they never change it up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years and am very happy with it. It&#x27;s nice to be able to get it from Amazon when local stores are out.</li>
            <li> Great product, great price, great experience</li>

            <li> The best conditioner I have ever found, and so glad I could still obtain a few bottles, since this is discontinued.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over 15 years.  It really does rinse clear, and is gentle to color treated and permed hair.</li>
            <li> Hard to find at any drug store or retail cosmetic counter.  Works great, smells wonderful.  Always trust Neutrogena.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is the best.  Rinses clean and does not bother my scalp even when I use it every day.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner! It leaves my color treated hair very soft and shiney,plus it smells terrific! I can&#x27;t find it in the store anymore so I was very happy to find it through Amazon!</li>
            <li> I used to use Pert because I liked that it was a conditioner and shampoo in one.  However, it stopped being a good shampoo for me because suddenly it started leaving a residue.  I started using Neutrogena shampoo.  However, I needed a conditioner--so I tried this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like it.  My hair is really fine and curly--very prone to tangles.  This stuff gives it body.  I have the lovely curls, but I can run my brush or comb through my hair and not encounter terrible snarls.</li>
            <li> No problems came fast</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a long time. Love it and love the price of the 3-pack. The matching shampoo is A1, also</li>
            <li> PERFECT! I tried first at a hotel and then I had to get it, my hair is never been so clean and manageable. I used to use redken and maroccanoil and the results are even better than with those expensive products.</li>
            <li> It was good to find a product that seems to be discontinued or not widely distributed. Cool!</li>
            <li> This conditioner is getting so hard to find, and I&#x27;m always worried they are going to discontinue it.  I have no idea why -- it&#x27;s the best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever found!  I&#x27;ve been using it for more years than I care to admit, and it&#x27;s fantastic!! I leaves my hair soft, but not weighted down. I also love the very light clean scent. I can&#x27;t stand  perfume-y hair products and this one has never made me break out like others have.  Please don&#x27;t stop making it!!</li>
            <li> The Best&#x3D;have used it for years !!!!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work like it did at the hotel. A different version?</li>
            <li> I just found this product, and I was disappointed to hear that it is discontinued. I hope I can continue to find it for awhile.</li>
            <li> This product has helped my hair greatly. I had doubts, but when one feels desperate, one may take a chance. I did and I am glad. My hair is very fine and as I have become older, it was very dry. This eliminates tangles and keeps the dryness away.</li>
            <li> This is the only brand I use.  All others are bad for my scalp.</li>
            <li> Excellent conditioner Doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down and you don&#x27;t get a residue buildup.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for 7-8 years and have always loved it. It&#x27;s clean, makes my hair soft, no greasy feel, etc. Hard to find this product locally so that&#x27;s why I ordered online.</li>
