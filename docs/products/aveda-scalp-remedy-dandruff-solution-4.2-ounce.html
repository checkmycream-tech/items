            <li>Feels good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with it</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t notice any difference when I use it, and it makes my hair kind of greasy and sticky.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery and great product.</li>
            <li>It seems that I need to add a good, clean, not greasy or oily moisturizer after using this.  </li>
            <li>and you get the added benefit of healthy hair.</li>
            <li>This product is more akin to a Scalpicin type of liquid.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Also, it smells great and feels great wet</li>
            <li>I love Aveda products, but this one just doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>It was packaged great and the whole transaction went as smooth as could be.</li>
            <li>and I am so happy with it so far.</li>
            <li>That is no longer available and this appears to be the replacement.</li>
            <li>and so happy to finally have something to stop the itching and flaking,</li>
            <li>I liked the old version of this product better.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance is best described as oregano and not strong once it sets in.</li>
            <li>so you gotta be quick.  </li>
            <li>My main gripe though, is that it is not as effective as the older version.  </li>
            <li>I used it for two days when I first got it.</li>
            <li>I am applying it consistently and dont really see any improvement.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>This is very useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its very watery and runny, when I place it on my scalp it drips everywhere and often causes my hair to be curly after i&#x27;ve straightened it.</li>
            <li>that much ( not that I don&#x27;t wash my hair</li>
            <li>this is the stuff for you...works fast</li>
            <li>You will pretty much need to wash your hair everyday or use an effective dry shampoo to keep this stuff from making your hair oily.</li>
            <li>I love this product, and have used it in the past.</li>
            <li>The problem with the new product is that is clear and has the consistency of water.  </li>
            <li>The new one is easier to apply, grant you, than the old one.  </li>
            <li>The old product had a more cream-like consistency that moisturized my dry scalp and would immediately soothe dry, irritated, and flaky areas.  </li>
            <li>&amp;#34;, this isn&#x27;t a replacement version of the old product.</li>
            <li>As someone was chronic flakes, this is the only thing I&#x27;ve found that helps and doesn&#x27;t smell like straight gasoline....</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t bother my sensitive lungs or scalp</li>
            <li>You have to be careful to get just the right amount evenly spread or it will look oily.</li>
            <li>but when it dries it leave a strange feeling that I don&#x27;t much prefer.</li>
            <li>If you suffer from dry scalp, I would absolutely recommend purchasing this product.</li>
            <li>Bring back the Old Version!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am 81 years old and have problems of skin dryness especially of the scalp.</li>

            <li> Bring back the Old Version!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am 81 years old and have problems of skin dryness especially of the scalp.</li>
            <li> And as far as this product running all over, you&#x27;re supposed to spray onto scalp with one hand and massage it in with the other hand.</li>
            <li> While I don&#x27;t have dandruff I do have a dry scalp, especially in the winter time.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it does help significantly but definitely has not cleared up my scalp psoriasis problem.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like me this will NOT cure your scalp long term, but continual use will cure it for each day you use it.</li>
            <li> Every year around this time my scalp and hair line around my face gets so dry and nothing has ever helped except Aveda Scalp Remedy.</li>
            <li> You are thinking of Dry remedy which is the concentrated oil drops.</li>
            <li> Having an extremely itchy scalp this past winter was harsh, and this was exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li> In order for this to supposedly work, you are to use it everyday until the problem disappears, but if you stop using it, the problem comes back.</li>
            <li> I have literally spent hundreds in trying to find a scalp psoriasis solution.</li>
            <li> Package arrived all wet and gooey.  </li>
            <li> ok, other products aren&#x27;t that bad</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been plagued by a sensitive, itchy, flaking scalp all my life due to my thick hair and oily scalp.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried vinegar rinses, lemon juice, olive oil, not washing my hair every day, washing it every day vigorously, and various products with little or no success.</li>
            <li> I use it every other day</li>
            <li> This is done with a spray-type bottle vs. the old product that had an eye dropper type applicator that was messy and slow.  </li>
            <li> I either flip my head upside down and give it 2-3 sprays and massage it in or spray it into my hand and massage in with my fingers.</li>
            <li> I had previously used an Aveda scalp moisturizing product that was a liquid that you poured into your fingers and rubbed into your scalp.</li>
            <li> Bottle leaked during transit and was therefore not full.  </li>
            <li> My scalp is perpetually flaky because of my thick hair.</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;ve gotten tired of spending $24 on something that is simply a temporary fix.</li>
            <li> With colored hair, I dread washing my hair everyday.  </li>
            <li> The flakiness that I was never able to get rid of has gone away.</li>
            <li> Not an option to spray this in my hair and style as usual.</li>
            <li> cause it&#x27;s expensive, but definitely won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> but you know what I mean.</li>
            <li> ; product, it made my hair sticky and disgusting and i always had to wash after i used it, no matter how little i used.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not an unpleasant smell if you like spices.</li>
            <li> terrible.</li>
            <li> Flakes are awful.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Makes my scalp feel soothed.</li>
            <li> terrible. I don&#x27;t know why they market this as a &amp;#34;leave in&amp;#34; product, it made my hair sticky and disgusting and i always had to wash after i used it, no matter how little i used. it did not work at all. save your money.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  It is a great replacement for hair gel and you get the added benefit of healthy hair.</li>
            <li> This is the only thing that gets rid of my occasional dandruff breakouts.  Just put in on the problem spots and they go away almost immediately!  And BONUS...you can put it on any time without it mucking up your hair!</li>
            <li> Smells good. Feels good. Works great on the scalp but it&#x27;s a bit more expensive on Amazon</li>
            <li> I liked the old version of this product better.  The new one is easier to apply, grant you, than the old one.  This is done with a spray-type bottle vs. the old product that had an eye dropper type applicator that was messy and slow.  The problem with the new product is that is clear and has the consistency of water.  It immediately begins to run when you spray it so you gotta be quick.  My main gripe though, is that it is not as effective as the older version.  The old product had a more cream-like consistency that moisturized my dry scalp and would immediately soothe dry, irritated, and flaky areas.  This product does not do that.  This product is more akin to a Scalpicin type of liquid. I am applying it consistently and dont really see any improvement.  Bummer!  Bring back the Old Version!</li>
            <li> I used it for two days when I first got it. The flakiness that I was never able to get rid of has gone away. I&#x27;m guessing it will last about a week, so I&#x27;ll re-apply every three or four days. My scalp is perpetually flaky because of my thick hair. This is very useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It isn&#x27;t what I thought I was buying, though. I wanted to buy the oil that was used at an aveda spa for a scalp cleansing massage.</li>
            <li> While I don&#x27;t have dandruff I do have a dry scalp, especially in the winter time. With my hair being relaxed with an African American texture, this product just isn&#x27;t moisturizing enough. Its very watery and runny, when I place it on my scalp it drips everywhere and often causes my hair to be curly after i&#x27;ve straightened it. If I happen to scratch my scalp, at times I feel a burning sensation from the remedy (just remember not to scratch). In order for this to supposedly work, you are to use it everyday until the problem disappears, but if you stop using it, the problem comes back. I go through this bottle often and i&#x27;ve gotten tired of spending $24 on something that is simply a temporary fix.</li>
            <li> Every year around this time my scalp and hair line around my face gets so dry and nothing has ever helped except Aveda Scalp Remedy. It works and smells great. If you suffer from dry scalp, I would absolutely recommend purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Haven&#x27;t found anything on the market to even compare it to. And, to Paul C- &amp;#34;disappointing evolution...&amp;#34;, this isn&#x27;t a replacement version of the old product. You are thinking of Dry remedy which is the concentrated oil drops. And as far as this product running all over, you&#x27;re supposed to spray onto scalp with one hand and massage it in with the other hand.</li>
            <li> Well, after reading the reviews I had big hopes for this stuff. I have literally spent hundreds in trying to find a scalp psoriasis solution. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it does help significantly but definitely has not cleared up my scalp psoriasis problem. It seems that I need to add a good, clean, not greasy or oily moisturizer after using this.  If I did that I may see some needed results. Also, it smells great and feels great wet but when it dries it leave a strange feeling that I don&#x27;t much prefer.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product. It reduces dandruff and also help keep the scalp moisturized. I use it every other day</li>
            <li> I had previously used an Aveda scalp moisturizing product that was a liquid that you poured into your fingers and rubbed into your scalp. That is no longer available and this appears to be the replacement. It sprays a foam onto your fingers which you then massaged into your scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 81 years old and have problems of skin dryness especially of the scalp. This product release all dryness and itchiness for 8 to 12 hours.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery and great product.</li>
            <li> Not an option to spray this in my hair and style as usual. I have to spray it, tie back hair and wash in am. It works, but because I have to wash afterwards, I don&#x27;t end up using it that much ( not that I don&#x27;t wash my hair, you just have to PLAN for this).</li>
            <li> I love this product, and have used it in the past.</li>
            <li> If you have an itchy head and dandruff this is the stuff for you...works fast</li>
            <li> I love Aveda products, but this one just doesn&#x27;t work for me. I don&#x27;t notice any difference when I use it, and it makes my hair kind of greasy and sticky. I&#x27;ll use it up cause it&#x27;s expensive, but definitely won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> Package arrived all wet and gooey.  Bottle leaked during transit and was therefore not full.  What was left seems to be working.</li>
            <li> As someone was chronic flakes, this is the only thing I&#x27;ve found that helps and doesn&#x27;t smell like straight gasoline.... ok, other products aren&#x27;t that bad but you know what I mean. Flakes are awful.</li>
            <li> With colored hair, I dread washing my hair everyday.  Having an extremely itchy scalp this past winter was harsh, and this was exactly what I needed.  You can feel the spray settling into your scalp and moisturizing it within minutes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been plagued by a sensitive, itchy, flaking scalp all my life due to my thick hair and oily scalp. I&#x27;ve tried vinegar rinses, lemon juice, olive oil, not washing my hair every day, washing it every day vigorously, and various products with little or no success. This is the only thing that&#x27;s ever worked and made a noticeable difference. I either flip my head upside down and give it 2-3 sprays and massage it in or spray it into my hand and massage in with my fingers. You have to be careful to get just the right amount evenly spread or it will look oily. You will pretty much need to wash your hair everyday or use an effective dry shampoo to keep this stuff from making your hair oily. The fragrance is best described as oregano and not strong once it sets in. Doesn&#x27;t bother my sensitive lungs or scalp and it&#x27;s not an unpleasant smell if you like spices. I have to apply it once during the day and once at night to keep it working. If you&#x27;re like me this will NOT cure your scalp long term, but continual use will cure it for each day you use it. All in all I&#x27;m very pleased with it and so happy to finally have something to stop the itching and flaking, no matter how temporary.</li>
            <li> This product works great and I am so happy with it so far. It was packaged great and the whole transaction went as smooth as could be. Will be back again.  Thank you!</li>
