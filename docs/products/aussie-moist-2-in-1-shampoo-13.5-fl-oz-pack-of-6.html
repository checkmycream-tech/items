            <li>The scent is pleasant.</li>
            <li>As always, the scent is pleasant.</li>
            <li>Good price, pleasant smell</li>
            <li>We all have a bit of the wavy, frizzy hair and this (and a bit of conditioner) was a good option for all of us.  </li>
            <li>In any case, if you have the appropriate hair type, this is a great shampoo.</li>
            <li>has a nice pleasant scent, and makes a nice lather.</li>
            <li>My first impressions after using were that all the aussie products it smells awesome.  </li>
            <li>I also love the smell!</li>
            <li>This shampoo has a pleasant scent and a good strong lather.</li>
            <li>Really great smelling, not too strong, cleans well and leaves a nice sheen to my hair.  </li>
            <li>It lathers really easily into a nice lather and my hair looks great after using it.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo is creamy and has a nice fragrance.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always liked Aussie products.</li>
            <li>Nice scent and calms the frizzies.  </li>
            <li>that&#x27;s quite nice to use in the morning.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It lathers wonderfully and left my hair looking great.</li>
            <li>It has a nice lather &amp; feels good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has no fragrance though, and my hair didnt have that nice shampoo smell.</li>
            <li>I am really loving this shampoo.</li>
            <li>The floral fragrance of jasmine is very pleasant and leaves a positive impact on the senses.&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li>Curly hair shouldn&#x27;t be washed that frequently, and a conditioning non-shampoo is best to use.</li>
            <li>This Aussie Miraculously Smooth Shampoo is good for a drug store shampoo.  </li>
            <li>so I was happy to get a chance to try out the miraculously smooth shampoo, plus the fact that I do have problems with static and frizz in the winter months made this one even more appealing.  </li>
            <li>While this shampoo does have a grape-y aroma, it is very light.  </li>
            <li>I love Aussie products, and I&#x27;m sticking with the Sydney Smooth!</li>
            <li>Since I am lacking more and more in the hair department, I also enlisted my wife to help me with this one.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really enjoyable smell</li>
            <li>I know they will love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It lathers up really well and smells great.  </li>
            <li>product is sudsy, more so than the product that I use most often.</li>
            <li>I had been using Frizz-Ease shampoo which is pretty good</li>
            <li>The Aussie shampoo made my hair have a nice smooth appearance and my hair even feels smooth without using a conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo</li>
            <li>It helps make my hair more smooth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This also is very inexpensive which to me is a good thing.  </li>
            <li>It looked clean and healthy.</li>
            <li>I love Aussie products and Miraculously Smooth Shampoo really does leave my hair nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The scent is fine, it doesn&#x27;t linger once you rinse it out.</li>
            <li>The original Aussie shampoos all had a strong grape-y aroma.  </li>
            <li>I had the opportunity to test out a bottle of Aussie&#x27;s Miraculously Smooth Shampoo</li>
            <li>It does miraculously make my hair smooth and shiny even without the conditioner to follow.  </li>
            <li>Importantly, it doesn&#x27;t all come out at once.</li>
            <li>This one works, cleans, and doesn&#x27;t leave her frizzy, but it&#x27;s not miraculously smooth.</li>
            <li>Neither of us got the smooth results</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a light flowery scent; probably the jasmine.  </li>
            <li>I also used conditioner and my hair looks smooth, no dryness at all.</li>
            <li>I want to pick up the Miraculously Smooth Conditioner as well and see how using both of them together would be.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why they messed with perfection, because their &amp;#34;improvement&amp;#34; just isn&#x27;t as good as the old shampoo.</li>
            <li>What makes this Aussie product a good one is that it is made out of natural</li>
            <li>I can say that the shampoo did a good job of cleansing my hair without completely stripping it.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant and thankfully mild fragrance, and seems to rinse out completely.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is exactly what I love in a shampoo.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling clean yet not stripped.</li>
            <li>It does work to clean my hair and head.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t comment on the smoothness, but I have a clean head</li>
            <li>fly away hair or dry hair.  </li>
            <li>I used it, it made my hair clean and it will be in the rotation of shampoos that I use until it&#x27;s gone.</li>
            <li>The product is much thicker than most shampoos and reminded us of conditioner or cream rinse.</li>
            <li>After using it, my hair feels so nice and incredibly soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad choice for an under $5 shampoo.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have fine wavy very frizzy hair, made more so by living in a very humid climate.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to use a ton to get good coverage for long hair.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s great at weighting it down and providing moisture.  </li>
            <li>However this Miraculously Smooth made my semi-curly and course hair very soft and easy to manage.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is my new favorite shampoo.  </li>
            <li>It is a good complement to the Aussie Conditioner,  Washes hair cleanly, smells nice, and leaves behind no residue.  </li>
            <li>My hair was smooth and pretty much frizz free.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the 3 minute miracle conditioner from Aussie for a while and really like it, so when I discovered that Aussie made a Miraculously Smooth shampoo, I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>It smells nice, very fruity, but I do miss the old Aussie scent.  </li>
            <li>Aussie is just right.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li>This is a great general purpose shampoo that my daughter really likes using for her long, curly hair.  </li>
            <li>Personally, I like the pump better since it&#x27;s WAY easier to use.  </li>
            <li>and currently I use more gentler types.</li>
            <li>This is the first time that I use this shampoo.</li>
            <li>My normal Suave shampoo does a much better job and costs less; my husband&#x27;s 2-in-1 VO-5 works much better for him and also costs less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s shampoo, it does what it is supposed to do, but what keeps me coming back to this bottle is the yummy smell and my hair is nice and soft!</li>
            <li>It does smell very nice, however, and it works well on my thick, frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li>I was offered this product as a choice on Vine, and thought I would give it a try, as I have used other Aussie products and liked them well</li>
            <li>/&gt;- Good sized bottle, so it&#x27;s not going to last only a week or two</li>
            <li>/&gt;Perhaps the problem was our longer hair (our hair is about the same length but differs in texture and curl/straightness) but it this is only good on shorter hair, it should say so.</li>
            <li>It has a really pretty, slightly tropical scent, but it&#x27;s very light and doesn&#x27;t annoy me during the day.  </li>
            <li>I had never tried this brand before, and I really like it</li>
            <li>It felt clean, but not dry and straw-like.</li>
            <li>We both have longer hair -- mine is curly, his is straight.</li>
            <li>It worked very well for me.</li>
            <li>I am a little worried that the dimethicone may build up in my hair over time, so I plan to rotate this shampoo with other, more clarifying shampoos, but overall I am happy with this stuff.  </li>
            <li>:  Light, fresh fragrance that was not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;  Larger than average shampoo bottle (400ml), but easy to handle.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>That means you get more washes out of each bottle comparing to some other</li>
            <li>A little bit does go a long way, which is great for those with lots of hair.  </li>
            <li>It is not a miraclous product, it is a bit better than other inexpensive products.</li>
            <li>This new formula doesn&#x27;t leave my hair near as smooth as the old Aussie formula.  </li>
            <li>My typical brands vary a bit depending mostly on what I find on sale but</li>
            <li>I am always fighting the frizzies, mainly around where I part my hair.  </li>
            <li>While I don&#x27;t think this is &amp;#34;miraculaously&amp;#34; smoothing, it is a decent shampoo for the money.  </li>
            <li>This Aussie shamppo has a pleasant scent and a little of it coes a long way.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used Aussie shampoos since I was in high school and college</li>
            <li>Normally if I don&#x27;t use a conditioner or detangler there is no way that I can get a brush through my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also have sensitive skin and allergies which means that I can&#x27;t use a lot of products especially products with a floral fragrance but had no problems with this one,  which probably means that it&#x27;s more of an individual thing.</li>
            <li>My wife states she doesn&#x27;t notice it any smoother than her normal shampoo.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am not sure what exactly is in this shampoo that gives it the smooth properties, but it works.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>We used it as directed yet once we were done our hair was less smooth, less easily combed or brushed, and in my case, had even more frizziness at that ends than when I just wet my hair without washing it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Aussie DEEEP for over ten years now but this is the first time I&#x27;ve tried their shampoos.  </li>
            <li>I do like the smell but think it is a little on the strong side.</li>
            <li>I strongly suspect it would be far too heavy.  </li>
            <li>I have hair with different textures in different places; the back top is very tight curls and coarse, the front sides are smooth and straight, and the rest is curly.  </li>
            <li>If you have fine or limp hair this is not the shampoo for you-</li>
            <li>/&gt;This works better than any shampoo I&#x27;ve tried so far to smooth the frizz and also imparts a little shine, something that is hard to achieve for me.  </li>
            <li>It has milky and creamy color, even though I prefer clear color shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works well on my hair and leaves it soft, silky and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li>to even Dove Men&#x27;s the Aussie brand is considerably cheaper</li>
            <li>Smooth\\&quot; shampoo in any stores near my home.</li>
            <li>She swears that it helps eliminate her natural frizzy and flyaway strands.</li>
            <li>It makes styling so much easier and last longer.</li>
            <li>It beats my old standby Frizzease</li>
            <li>It cleans hair well without overdrying, leaving hair soft.  </li>
            <li>gave me some soft hair that still had body and bounce.  </li>
            <li>I frequently choose Aussie products so it may well show up again.</li>
            <li>I have thick, coarse hair that has a mind of its own.</li>
            <li>The next thing that I noticed was that my hair was much more smooth and less tangled than usual.  </li>
            <li>Good, thick shampoo that won&#x27;t all be gone in a week like some other</li>
            <li>:  None, really, but this shampoo was not remarkable, or any better than economy shampoos such as&lt;br /</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the middle of winter and my hair rarely frizzes in all the dry air produced by heating systems.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think a shampoo can really make your hair smooth, but it can help not make frizzy hair worse.  </li>
            <li>I would suggest using this as a mild clarifying shampoo since it&#x27;s not quite so harsh and stripping.</li>
            <li>Bring back the old scent!  </li>
            <li>Shampoo came out looking rich and lathered very easily, so only a small amount was needed.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>It would like work really well for anyone with hair that isn&#x27;t especially dry.</li>
            <li>I have long, thick, wavy hair that doesn&#x27;t like cheap conditioner.</li>

            <li> My normal Suave shampoo does a much better job and costs less; my husband&#x27;s 2-in-1 VO-5 works much better for him and also costs less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s shampoo, it does what it is supposed to do, but what keeps me coming back to this bottle is the yummy smell and my hair is nice and soft!</li>
            <li> It does smell very nice, however, and it works well on my thick, frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li> I was offered this product as a choice on Vine, and thought I would give it a try, as I have used other Aussie products and liked them well</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Good sized bottle, so it&#x27;s not going to last only a week or two</li>
            <li> /&gt;Perhaps the problem was our longer hair (our hair is about the same length but differs in texture and curl/straightness) but it this is only good on shorter hair, it should say so.</li>
            <li> It has a really pretty, slightly tropical scent, but it&#x27;s very light and doesn&#x27;t annoy me during the day.  </li>
            <li> I had never tried this brand before, and I really like it</li>
            <li> It felt clean, but not dry and straw-like.</li>
            <li> We both have longer hair -- mine is curly, his is straight.</li>
            <li> It worked very well for me.</li>
            <li> I am a little worried that the dimethicone may build up in my hair over time, so I plan to rotate this shampoo with other, more clarifying shampoos, but overall I am happy with this stuff.  </li>
            <li> :  Light, fresh fragrance that was not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;  Larger than average shampoo bottle (400ml), but easy to handle.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> That means you get more washes out of each bottle comparing to some other</li>
            <li> A little bit does go a long way, which is great for those with lots of hair.  </li>
            <li> It is not a miraclous product, it is a bit better than other inexpensive products.</li>
            <li> This new formula doesn&#x27;t leave my hair near as smooth as the old Aussie formula.  </li>
            <li> My typical brands vary a bit depending mostly on what I find on sale but</li>
            <li> I am always fighting the frizzies, mainly around where I part my hair.  </li>
            <li> While I don&#x27;t think this is &amp;#34;miraculaously&amp;#34; smoothing, it is a decent shampoo for the money.  </li>
            <li> This Aussie shamppo has a pleasant scent and a little of it coes a long way.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used Aussie shampoos since I was in high school and college</li>
            <li> Normally if I don&#x27;t use a conditioner or detangler there is no way that I can get a brush through my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also have sensitive skin and allergies which means that I can&#x27;t use a lot of products especially products with a floral fragrance but had no problems with this one,  which probably means that it&#x27;s more of an individual thing.</li>
            <li> My wife states she doesn&#x27;t notice it any smoother than her normal shampoo.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am not sure what exactly is in this shampoo that gives it the smooth properties, but it works.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> We used it as directed yet once we were done our hair was less smooth, less easily combed or brushed, and in my case, had even more frizziness at that ends than when I just wet my hair without washing it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Aussie DEEEP for over ten years now but this is the first time I&#x27;ve tried their shampoos.  </li>
            <li> I do like the smell but think it is a little on the strong side.</li>
            <li> I strongly suspect it would be far too heavy.  </li>
            <li> I have hair with different textures in different places; the back top is very tight curls and coarse, the front sides are smooth and straight, and the rest is curly.  </li>
            <li> If you have fine or limp hair this is not the shampoo for you-</li>
            <li> /&gt;This works better than any shampoo I&#x27;ve tried so far to smooth the frizz and also imparts a little shine, something that is hard to achieve for me.  </li>
            <li> It has milky and creamy color, even though I prefer clear color shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works well on my hair and leaves it soft, silky and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li> to even Dove Men&#x27;s the Aussie brand is considerably cheaper</li>
            <li> Smooth\\&quot; shampoo in any stores near my home.</li>
            <li> She swears that it helps eliminate her natural frizzy and flyaway strands.</li>
            <li> It makes styling so much easier and last longer.</li>
            <li> It beats my old standby Frizzease</li>
            <li> It cleans hair well without overdrying, leaving hair soft.  </li>
            <li> gave me some soft hair that still had body and bounce.  </li>
            <li> I frequently choose Aussie products so it may well show up again.</li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse hair that has a mind of its own.</li>
            <li> The next thing that I noticed was that my hair was much more smooth and less tangled than usual.  </li>
            <li> Good, thick shampoo that won&#x27;t all be gone in a week like some other</li>
            <li> :  None, really, but this shampoo was not remarkable, or any better than economy shampoos such as&lt;br /</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the middle of winter and my hair rarely frizzes in all the dry air produced by heating systems.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think a shampoo can really make your hair smooth, but it can help not make frizzy hair worse.  </li>
            <li> I would suggest using this as a mild clarifying shampoo since it&#x27;s not quite so harsh and stripping.</li>
            <li> Bring back the old scent!  </li>
            <li> Shampoo came out looking rich and lathered very easily, so only a small amount was needed.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> It would like work really well for anyone with hair that isn&#x27;t especially dry.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, wavy hair that doesn&#x27;t like cheap conditioner.</li>
            <li> noticed that one other reviewer who has problems with sensitive skin had a rash after using the shampoo.  </li>
            <li> For some reason I have trouble finding this particular \\&quot;Sydney</li>
            <li> but I do use it on days when I plan to straighten my hair with a flat iron.  </li>
            <li> Typically I use A few different shampoos, alternating from one specially made for curly hair to another that is moisturizing and cuts down on frizz.</li>
            <li> My hair comes out soft with less frizz.</li>
            <li> Most other shampoos at this price that claim to be defrizzing usually make my hair worse, so I was pleasantly surprised that this did not do this.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy hair which I typically blow dry to straighten.  </li>
            <li> My hair is naturally wavy - not really curly or frizzy but needs a little extra smoothing if I want it sleek/straight.  </li>
            <li> I have a long curly hair and wanted to try out</li>
            <li> It lathers unusually well and is thick as it comes out of the bottle.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo is quite thick, and it lathers very generously.  </li>
            <li> but if I find one I love that is less expensive why not use</li>
            <li> I must say this is different from other shampoos both in the experience of it, and how it works on my hair.  </li>
            <li> I feel like it&#x27;s a little bit less frizzy than normal as well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a very faint mango scent which is my favorite scent in products.  </li>
            <li> But, every few washes I&#x27;ll use a regular shampoo to get rid of build up</li>
            <li> and it definitely seems to help tame down my hair which if left without product (usually pomade) gets frizzy; especially as my hair grows out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve also noticed that I only need to use a small amount to get the cleansing I need.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo is a creamy white and has a thick consistency.</li>
            <li> less frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My daughter, who has a hairstyle that requires her to straighten her slightly wavy hair, loves this shampoo.</li>
            <li> &gt;  Resulted in slightly shinier</li>
            <li> so my daughter who has long thick hair used it.</li>
            <li> It is always looking a little frazzled.</li>
            <li> If you were hoping for the old Aussie scent in this shampoo, sadly it does not have it.  </li>
            <li> It is pale green.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo is very thick and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I assume the main smoothing ingredient in this is dimethicone, which I was afraid would take all the body out of my hair and leave it limp, even with styling products.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the aroma isn&#x27;t the only thing they changed.  </li>
            <li> usually Suave or Dove Men&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to properly test out this product for its ability to get rid of frizz.</li>
            <li> I always use a volumizing mousse and this shampoo with my usual conditioner in conjunction with volumizing mousse</li>
            <li> Aussie&#x27;s shampoo hits a balance with the smell that doesn&#x27;t seem to stick around beyond my shower or at least not perceptibly so to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared</li>
            <li> : The one thing that is irritating about this shampoo is how difficult the cap is to open!  </li>
            <li> But for thick hair</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the combination shampoo/conditioner types because they alway made my hair feel to thick, and with continual use created a buildup feel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used expensive shampoos</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The original Aussie shampoos all had a strong grape-y aroma.  While this shampoo does have a grape-y aroma, it is very light.  Unfortunately, the aroma isn&#x27;t the only thing they changed.  This new formula doesn&#x27;t leave my hair near as smooth as the old Aussie formula.  I don&#x27;t know why they messed with perfection, because their &amp;#34;improvement&amp;#34; just isn&#x27;t as good as the old shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have a long curly hair and wanted to try out this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the features are as follows:-&lt;br /&gt;1) It works well on my hair and leaves it soft, silky and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;2) What makes this Aussie product a good one is that it is made out of natural ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;3) The floral fragrance of jasmine is very pleasant and leaves a positive impact on the senses.&lt;br /&gt;4) The price is reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;5) It works in tandem with a hair conditioner.</li>
            <li> I had the opportunity to test out a bottle of Aussie&#x27;s Miraculously Smooth Shampoo and it&#x27;s worked out well for me. I tend to use cheaper, decidedly &amp;#34;low-end&amp;#34; shampoo&#x27;s unlike my wife who splurges a bit on shampoo. My typical brands vary a bit depending mostly on what I find on sale but usually Suave or Dove Men&#x27;s. I do like the Aussie brand and it definitely seems to help tame down my hair which if left without product (usually pomade) gets frizzy; especially as my hair grows out. With the Aussie I&#x27;ve had luck just washing my hair and stepping out of the house to run errands with nothing in my hair; my hair was less frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is definitely on the floral side but not overly so like Herbal Essences or Fructis which I avoid specifically because of the overpowering smell. Aussie&#x27;s shampoo hits a balance with the smell that doesn&#x27;t seem to stick around beyond my shower or at least not perceptibly so to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to even Dove Men&#x27;s the Aussie brand is considerably cheaper so I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li> For some reason I have trouble finding this particular \\&quot;Sydney Smooth\\&quot; shampoo in any stores near my home. Thought I would check on line and found it through Amazon. Now I am stocked up.</li>
            <li> My daughter, who has a hairstyle that requires her to straighten her slightly wavy hair, loves this shampoo. She swears that it helps eliminate her natural frizzy and flyaway strands. It makes styling so much easier and last longer. The shampoo is creamy and has a nice fragrance. It beats paying the salon price for similar shampoos.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always liked Aussie products. I have hair with different textures in different places; the back top is very tight curls and coarse, the front sides are smooth and straight, and the rest is curly.  Curly hair shouldn&#x27;t be washed that frequently, and a conditioning non-shampoo is best to use. But, every few washes I&#x27;ll use a regular shampoo to get rid of build up and this worked well. It leaves my hair feeling clean yet not stripped. It would like work really well for anyone with hair that isn&#x27;t especially dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Aussie DEEEP for over ten years now but this is the first time I&#x27;ve tried their shampoos.  I have fine wavy very frizzy hair, made more so by living in a very humid climate.  I need lots of product on my hair to have it not be a ball of frizz.  I had been using Frizz-Ease shampoo which is pretty good but over time it was too drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This works better than any shampoo I&#x27;ve tried so far to smooth the frizz and also imparts a little shine, something that is hard to achieve for me.  It is also detangling and almost does not require a separate conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a very faint mango scent which is my favorite scent in products.  It lathers unusually well and is thick as it comes out of the bottle.  It is pale green.  I must say this is different from other shampoos both in the experience of it, and how it works on my hair.  It beats my old standby Frizzease completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This also is very inexpensive which to me is a good thing.  I&#x27;ve used expensive shampoos but if I find one I love that is less expensive why not use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my new favorite shampoo.  I can&#x27;t believe how well it smooths my hair.</li>
            <li> This is a great general purpose shampoo that my daughter really likes using for her long, curly hair.  It is a good complement to the Aussie Conditioner,  Washes hair cleanly, smells nice, and leaves behind no residue.  It is also a great value for a home shampoo.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I love Aussie products and Miraculously Smooth Shampoo really does leave my hair nice and smooth. I have thick, coarse hair that has a mind of its own. It is always looking a little frazzled. The Aussie shampoo made my hair have a nice smooth appearance and my hair even feels smooth without using a conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo has a nice pleasant scent, and makes a nice lather. I will definitely keep using it!</li>
            <li> It does miraculously make my hair smooth and shiny even without the conditioner to follow.  The scent is pleasant. It has milky and creamy color, even though I prefer clear color shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also noticed that I only need to use a small amount to get the cleansing I need.  That means you get more washes out of each bottle comparing to some other brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of the aussie hair products so I was happy to get a chance to try out the miraculously smooth shampoo, plus the fact that I do have problems with static and frizz in the winter months made this one even more appealing.  My first impressions after using were that all the aussie products it smells awesome.  The next thing that I noticed was that my hair was much more smooth and less tangled than usual.  Normally if I don&#x27;t use a conditioner or detangler there is no way that I can get a brush through my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed that one other reviewer who has problems with sensitive skin had a rash after using the shampoo.  I also have sensitive skin and allergies which means that I can&#x27;t use a lot of products especially products with a floral fragrance but had no problems with this one,  which probably means that it&#x27;s more of an individual thing.</li>
            <li> I love Aussie products, and I&#x27;m sticking with the Sydney Smooth! My hair comes out soft with less frizz. Personally, I like the pump better since it&#x27;s WAY easier to use.  I also love the smell! I like to use a lot of different shampoos/conditioners, and this is one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> Nice scent and calms the frizzies.  My hair is not frizzy so my daughter who has long thick hair used it. It left her hair smoother and softer.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, wavy hair that doesn&#x27;t like cheap conditioner. This one passed the test. My hair responded well to the creamy formula. I didn&#x27;t use the corresponding shampoo, but it seems that would only improve things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is very pleasant. You don&#x27;t have to use a ton to get good coverage for long hair. I had never tried this brand before, and I really like it</li>
            <li> Really great smelling, not too strong, cleans well and leaves a nice sheen to my hair.  Never strips my hair like those &amp;#34;Clean&amp;#34; shampoos.  I let my kids use this as well, and they like it.</li>
            <li> If you were hoping for the old Aussie scent in this shampoo, sadly it does not have it.  It does smell very nice, however, and it works well on my thick, frizzy hair.  The shampoo is quite thick, and it lathers very generously.  A little bit does go a long way, which is great for those with lots of hair.  If you have fine or limp hair this is not the shampoo for you- I strongly suspect it would be far too heavy.  But for thick hair it&#x27;s great at weighting it down and providing moisture.  The scent is like grape bubblegum.  It smells nice, very fruity, but I do miss the old Aussie scent.  Bring back the old scent!  In any case, if you have the appropriate hair type, this is a great shampoo.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to properly test out this product for its ability to get rid of frizz. It&#x27;s the middle of winter and my hair rarely frizzes in all the dry air produced by heating systems. I can say that the shampoo did a good job of cleansing my hair without completely stripping it. It felt clean, but not dry and straw-like. As always, the scent is pleasant. I would suggest using this as a mild clarifying shampoo since it&#x27;s not quite so harsh and stripping.</li>
            <li> Since I am lacking more and more in the hair department, I also enlisted my wife to help me with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- It smells great. Really enjoyable smell that&#x27;s quite nice to use in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;- It does work to clean my hair and head. It&#x27;s a #1 / #2 so I can&#x27;t comment on the smoothness, but I have a clean head daily.&lt;br /&gt;- Good sized bottle, so it&#x27;s not going to last only a week or two&lt;br /&gt;- Importantly, it doesn&#x27;t all come out at once. Good, thick shampoo that won&#x27;t all be gone in a week like some other brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- My wife states she doesn&#x27;t notice it any smoother than her normal shampoo. This one works, cleans, and doesn&#x27;t leave her frizzy, but it&#x27;s not miraculously smooth.</li>
            <li> This Aussie shamppo has a pleasant scent and a little of it coes a long way. It lathers wonderfully and left my hair looking great. The shampoo is a creamy white and has a thick consistency. The only shampoos I avoid are those that are overscented. Aussie is just right.</li>
            <li> Smells so good!  It&#x27;s shampoo, it does what it is supposed to do, but what keeps me coming back to this bottle is the yummy smell and my hair is nice and soft!</li>
            <li> This shampoo is exactly what I love in a shampoo.  It has a really pretty, slightly tropical scent, but it&#x27;s very light and doesn&#x27;t annoy me during the day.  It lathers really easily into a nice lather and my hair looks great after using it.  I&#x27;ve always loved Aussie products and if you do too, you will probably be really happy with this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I and my partner both used this product for 10 days to test it out. We both have longer hair -- mine is curly, his is straight. Neither of us got the smooth results the label promises.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is fine, it doesn&#x27;t linger once you rinse it out. I have very sensitive skin but this did not cause me any irritation. The product is much thicker than most shampoos and reminded us of conditioner or cream rinse. We used it as directed yet once we were done our hair was less smooth, less easily combed or brushed, and in my case, had even more frizziness at that ends than when I just wet my hair without washing it. My normal Suave shampoo does a much better job and costs less; my husband&#x27;s 2-in-1 VO-5 works much better for him and also costs less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps the problem was our longer hair (our hair is about the same length but differs in texture and curl/straightness) but it this is only good on shorter hair, it should say so.</li>
            <li> This Aussie Miraculously Smooth Shampoo is good for a drug store shampoo.  It cleans hair well without overdrying, leaving hair soft.  I don&#x27;t think a shampoo can really make your hair smooth, but it can help not make frizzy hair worse.  This shampoo has a pleasant scent and a good strong lather.</li>
            <li> I like this shampoo.  My hair is naturally wavy - not really curly or frizzy but needs a little extra smoothing if I want it sleek/straight.  I don&#x27;t use this shampoo every day but I do use it on days when I plan to straighten my hair with a flat iron.  It helps make my hair more smooth. It doesn&#x27;t seem to build up or strip my hair.  It has a nice lather &amp; feels good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a light flowery scent; probably the jasmine.  If you don&#x27;t like scented shampoo, you may not like this.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised. I haven&#x27;t used Aussie shampoos since I was in high school and college and currently I use more gentler types. However this Miraculously Smooth made my semi-curly and course hair very soft and easy to manage. You almost don&#x27;t even need any conditioner afterwards if your a guy. (you may not). I don&#x27;t like the combination shampoo/conditioner types because they alway made my hair feel to thick, and with continual use created a buildup feel. This doesn&#x27;t seem to do that at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure what exactly is in this shampoo that gives it the smooth properties, but it works. I do like the smell but think it is a little on the strong side. Some people may like this. I will be giving this to my teenager who is using Aussie now. I know they will love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 stars.</li>
            <li> This shampoo seems to do what it claims and smooths fly away hair or dry hair.  This shampoo is very thick and a little goes a long way.  It lathers up really well and smells great.  I also used conditioner and my hair looks smooth, no dryness at all.</li>
            <li> This is the first time that I use this shampoo. It worked very well for me. My hair was smooth and pretty much frizz free. It looked clean and healthy. It has no fragrance though, and my hair didnt have that nice shampoo smell.</li>
            <li> Our family gave this shampoo a thumbs up.  Good price, pleasant smell, works like you expect shampoo to work!  We all have a bit of the wavy, frizzy hair and this (and a bit of conditioner) was a good option for all of us.  Recommended.</li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy hair which I typically blow dry to straighten.  I am always fighting the frizzies, mainly around where I part my hair.  This shampoo took care of that.  I assume the main smoothing ingredient in this is dimethicone, which I was afraid would take all the body out of my hair and leave it limp, even with styling products.  I always use a volumizing mousse and this shampoo with my usual conditioner in conjunction with volumizing mousse gave me some soft hair that still had body and bounce.  Meanwhile, the frizzies along my part are gone!  I am a little worried that the dimethicone may build up in my hair over time, so I plan to rotate this shampoo with other, more clarifying shampoos, but overall I am happy with this stuff.  It&#x27;s not a bad choice for an under $5 shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: The one thing that is irritating about this shampoo is how difficult the cap is to open!  Don&#x27;t even bother with this stuff if you have arthritis in your hands!</li>
            <li> I received one bottle of this shampoo to sample and review.  I asked my wife and daughter help me.  The three of us used it for a week (about 3 times each) and came to this consensus:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  Light, fresh fragrance that was not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;  Larger than average shampoo bottle (400ml), but easy to handle.&lt;br /&gt;  Shampoo came out looking rich and lathered very easily, so only a small amount was needed.&lt;br /&gt;  Resulted in slightly shinier hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  None, really, but this shampoo was not remarkable, or any better than economy shampoos such as&lt;br /&gt;  Suave or Herbal Essence.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the 3 minute miracle conditioner from Aussie for a while and really like it, so when I discovered that Aussie made a Miraculously Smooth shampoo, I decided to give it a try. I am really loving this shampoo. After using it, my hair feels so nice and incredibly soft. I feel like it&#x27;s a little bit less frizzy than normal as well. I want to pick up the Miraculously Smooth Conditioner as well and see how using both of them together would be.</li>
            <li> Typically I use A few different shampoos, alternating from one specially made for curly hair to another that is moisturizing and cuts down on frizz. I was offered this product as a choice on Vine, and thought I would give it a try, as I have used other Aussie products and liked them well enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is sudsy, more so than the product that I use most often. It has a pleasant and thankfully mild fragrance, and seems to rinse out completely. There isn&#x27;t a lot to say about a product such as shampoo. I used it, it made my hair clean and it will be in the rotation of shampoos that I use until it&#x27;s gone. I frequently choose Aussie products so it may well show up again.</li>
            <li> While I don&#x27;t think this is &amp;#34;miraculaously&amp;#34; smoothing, it is a decent shampoo for the money.  Most other shampoos at this price that claim to be defrizzing usually make my hair worse, so I was pleasantly surprised that this did not do this.  It is not a miraclous product, it is a bit better than other inexpensive products.</li>
