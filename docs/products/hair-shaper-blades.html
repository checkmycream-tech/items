            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a straight razor for 20 years.  When I used these blades, I drew blood four times, and the places where I didn&#x27;t actually nick the skin have an ugly rash that resembles acne.  I&#x27;m not sure what type chemical process, or metal additive would cause a reaction like this but I will never use these blades again.</li>
            <li> Super Sharp as intended. My hairline is fresh!</li>
            <li> This is exactly what my wife was looking for.  We were able to replace an old worn out blade with a new one and immediately had a chance to use it and it worked like it should have with no problems.</li>
            <li> Works like it should.</li>
            <li> Definitely Personna&#x27;s best blades yet.  They are indeed extra sharp.

            <li> Work as they should. But nothing great.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery and product was in great shape but it was a crap shoot with all the blades to choose from as they dont state the size of the blade. It was not what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I came across a Weck surgical prep straight razor that uses these blades. I was given the razor over 30 years ago and when I ran out of blades, I just put it away. These blades are sharp, arrived on time and and will last about 7-10 shaves as I wear a beard. I recommend these, but have no idea where one could get a new razor to use them. I understand they are used primarily in shaping combs.</li>
            <li> I love these things. I use them in my hair shaper. Very sharp, i have no doubt about these blades.</li>

            <li> But definitely only for the person who likes to live on the wild side.  Yesseree.  It takes a clear mind, a steady hand, and nerves of steel.  Not for environments where young children might be a distraction.  I have a Richard The Lion-heart beard and these puppies allow me to do all of the long straight lines, as well as the intricate cutouts.</li>
            <li> Great price.  I will buy these again as needed.</li>
            <li> Really sharp, and if you&#x27;re using them for personal use like shaving they&#x27;ll last 5+ shaves even if you have thick facial hair.</li>
            <li> High quality blades. Will continue to purchase more in the future.</li>
            <li> My husband uses these for straight razor shaving and loves them. I was getting them at Sally Beauty but it&#x27;s great to find them for such a good price here.</li>
            <li> I arch eyebrows a lot and these blades work very well!!....especially for the price!!!! Please be sure to toss them after each client!!!! They also make it easier for meti arch my own eyebrows!!</li>

            <li> works real well and lasts through many haircuts.  A box usually lasts me more than 4 months.</li>
            <li> The blades worked excellently in shaving facial hair.  Was taken on a mission trip to the Central America and was used to provide styling for the local populace.</li>
            <li> my mom was a hairdresser 40 years ago and these were the only thing she ever used to cut hair. When i told her I could get them on line  she was so happy. At 81 she still does her own hair and loves the blades</li>
