    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>The design is corded, rather than cordless, so if that is not an issue for you, this is a great shaver!</li>
            <li>more Remington brand for me, ever!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own</li>
            <li>Suspect that&#x27;s why it seems to not work most of the time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Do wish that a better quality razor - non battery type - could be found.</li>
            <li>I was going to ask them some more questions, but the lady on the support line at Madison, Wisconsin hung up on me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Summary:  A nice cheap razor for not waking others.  </li>
            <li>I have been using a Remington R-835 corded shaver for the last couple of years, and it&#x27;s been a very good shaver.  </li>
            <li>Easily the quietest razor</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend everyone to AVOID REMINGTON at all costs and</li>
            <li>I find it very easy to shave with and for an electric, it gives you a pretty close looking shave.</li>
            <li>it was cheap.</li>
            <li>That seemed okay, but also the cutters are attached to the shaver with it&#x27;s own, individual cover.  </li>
            <li>A great shaver at a great price works just as well as it all the expensive ones.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;d have to work for a &#x27;clean&#x27; shave with this one.  </li>
            <li>and this is as good or better than any other razors I have used.  </li>
            <li>Overall for the money, it&#x27;s a good value in my opinion if you don&#x27;t mind being tethered to an outlet while shaving.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;d spend the extra $15 on something that has good reviews on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Not as good as the earlier models.</li>
            <li>But the funny part is that the fit and finish actually look good.</li>
            <li>I have to agree it hurts during and after shaving even mild stubble.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for a week and find it to be adequate.  </li>
            <li>If I was able to buy this corded shaver with the new head now, I would give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li>The shaver is REALLY good now, and works as well or better than any I&#x27;ve used in the past, whether Remington or Norelco.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure there are cheaper versions that do the same thing, but this is fine.</li>
            <li>My advice is to buy a better model, you may pay a little more, but you will get a quicker, smoother, pain-free clean shave.</li>
            <li>My face is burning right now.</li>
            <li>Sure the shaves aren&#x27;t \\&quot;razor close\\&quot;, but I never expected it to be.</li>
            <li>Product works fine as far as shaving goes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m mostly bald, and use the shaver for my beard and head several times a week.  </li>
            <li>Tugs a bit more to get to the short hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wished my old Norelco that was 35 years old was still alive because it was way better then this thing!</li>
            <li>The designer simply don&#x27;t like a shaver that is easy to use and without hassle.</li>
            <li>Straight AC.&lt;br /&gt;DIS</li>
            <li>A fast shave, and a fast 3:00 Shadow (some folks like that).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ever owned, including straight blades.  </li>
            <li>It is smooth and soft on the skin and completely ineffective.</li>
            <li>As a result if I shave both head and beard, I 3 nice big donuts of hair under each cutter which have to be removed or the shaver sometimes won&#x27;t even go, it just stutters like there&#x27;s not enough power to spin the cutters.  </li>
            <li>The older model had rotating blades with coarse and fine slots to improve performance.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t speak to longevity/cost of the blades or anything - really though, replacement screens/blades almost ALWAYS cost as much as a new razor.  </li>
            <li>I had an older Remington model that was discontinued but shaved well.  </li>
            <li>The heads spin inside however I don&#x27;t think the motor is strong enough to spin all three blades fast enough.</li>
            <li>The little clipper it has shaves better than the razors.</li>
            <li>That bothers me so I am in the market for a new electric shaver that is rechargeable.</li>
            <li>Well the cutters cost about as much as a new shaver, and the 835 had been discontinued so I then found this model, the Flex 360.  </li>
            <li>so we buy new again and again.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very early morning, when silence is king.  </li>
            <li>After having replaced an old Norelco with the only new Norelco available - which does not cut my beard - I chose to try a simple Remington.  </li>
            <li>Taking it back and buying a higher end non-Remington brand.</li>
            <li>- you have to plug it in and be near an outlet when you shave. 2).</li>
            <li>Straight AC only, I have to watch that cord.  </li>
            <li>I am giving 2 stars because it saved a couple of nights that I had a beard and no other shavers!</li>
            <li>The shave is ok, but why all the components fit so badly.</li>
            <li>Since, at this price one can only expect the razor to last a year, user has no complaint in that regard.  </li>
            <li>The only complaint I really had was that the protective cap doesnt actually fit on the thing, but other than that</li>
            <li>It did pinch a little in certain areas, but it seems to work well.    </li>
            <li>The blades knock down the high hair FAST.&lt;br /&gt;DIS:</li>

            <li> I have an 3+ year old Remington that still works but is dull.</li>
            <li> I spent 30 minutes trying to shave and what I got was a sore face.</li>

            <li> Not worth the aggravation.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve always used a Norelco shaver but decided to try this brand as it was a little cheaper.  </li>
            <li> Never truly understand why the cover has to be so loose and difficult to put it back in.</li>
            <li> This shaver is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Mine is dead just after about 10 uses.</li>
            <li> I prefer the corded razors because you never have to worry about a dead battery.</li>
            <li> Not easy to re-assemble.</li>
            <li> Also be cause of this stupid design, the whiskers don&#x27;t fall into the big space in the head underneath the cutters, no, instead they accumulate directly under the cutters.  </li>
            <li> Cuts very little.</li>
            <li> If my stubble is a few days old it painfully yanks out the hairs rather than shave them.</li>
            <li> Very difficult to clean and reassemble -- cutter assembly difficult to disassemble, difficult to insert and reattach cutters, difficult to make the thing go at all if you manage to get that far.</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t understand all of the negative reviews on this shaver.</li>
            <li> While it does cut my beard, at least 75% of the time the heads and blades pop off.  </li>

            <li> Weak motor.</li>

            <li> Razor seems weak of motor and shaves marginal compared to it&#x27;s predecessor.  </li>

            <li> With this you will get an unkempt, painful shave that takes over a half an hour.</li>
            <li> Although it shaves pretty well, the design is so stupid and annoying that I had to describe it here.  </li>

            <li> Can not keep the cutting heads on this thing!</li>
            <li> I absolutely hate products with batteries for environmental reasons.  </li>
            <li> I bought a Remington 3130 shaver at Walgreen and it is really terrible.</li>
            <li> it was also insanely rediculous.  </li>
            <li> This is beyond a doubt the worst rotary razor I have ever owned.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand all of the negative reviews on this shaver. This shaver was given to me as a gift about 6 months and I have not experienced any of the problems that others are writing about. I find it very easy to shave with and for an electric, it gives you a pretty close looking shave. Before I got this shaver, my skin was breaking out constantly from using a razor and shaving cream. I haven&#x27;t used an electric shaver in about 20 years prior to getting this one. After using this electric shaver for a very short while, my skin began clearing up. Sure the shaves aren&#x27;t \\&quot;razor close\\&quot;, but I never expected it to be. After about 6 months of shaving every day with this Remington shaver, I&#x27;m still getting \\&quot;electric shaver\\&quot; close shaves every day and no skin irritation or rashes.     I only have 2 complaints about this shaver, 1). It&#x27;s not rechargeable - you have to plug it in and be near an outlet when you shave. 2). It doesn&#x27;t come with a carrying/storage case.     Overall for the money, it&#x27;s a good value in my opinion if you don&#x27;t mind being tethered to an outlet while shaving. That bothers me so I am in the market for a new electric shaver that is rechargeable.</li>
            <li> Reasons:  1) Hurts to shave  2) Hurts after shaving  3) Doesn&#x27;t charge  4) Weak and Dull  5) ...    I am giving 2 stars because it saved a couple of nights that I had a beard and no other shavers!</li>
            <li> I bought a Remington 3130 shaver at Walgreen and it is really terrible. It has no power, doesn&#x27;t cut my beard well at all. It is smooth and soft on the skin and completely ineffective. I would give it one star but my computer won&#x27;t allow me to do it.</li>
            <li> This shaver is a waste of money. It shaves very poorly. I have to go over the same spot over and over in slow rotations to get a shave. If my stubble is a few days old it painfully yanks out the hairs rather than shave them. The blades are very weak and it is near impossible to shave hard-to-reach places around the jawbone. It is also very difficult to shave the upper-lip with this. They say in the manual to use it on a dry face, but that is too rough and will leave bumps as the shaver tears the hair from your face. My advice is to buy a better model, you may pay a little more, but you will get a quicker, smoother, pain-free clean shave. With this you will get an unkempt, painful shave that takes over a half an hour.</li>
            <li> The shave is ok, but why all the components fit so badly. Never truly understand why the cover has to be so loose and difficult to put it back in. The shaving blade is so easy to detach and the shaver latch is so difficult to open and close. But the funny part is that the fit and finish actually look good. I can only guess that it is a design issue. The designer simply don&#x27;t like a shaver that is easy to use and without hassle. Get a Norelco.</li>
            <li> I could NOT find a razor WITHOUT a battery other than this one.  I had an older Remington model that was discontinued but shaved well.  This one has the cheapest blades with only one screen.  The older model had rotating blades with coarse and fine slots to improve performance.  I used this 3130 model and my neck never looks shaved.  I absolutely hate products with batteries for environmental reasons.  It&#x27;s not like I need to carry it around with me.  One day it slipped out of my hand and the head broke off.  Cleaning it was also insanely rediculous.  I purchased this through amazon who sent it from Target.</li>
            <li> Weak motor. Too quiet. Suspect that&#x27;s why it seems to not work most of the time. Dull. Cuts very little. Tried it for a week. The heads spin inside however I don&#x27;t think the motor is strong enough to spin all three blades fast enough. I have an 3+ year old Remington that still works but is dull. This model is not a replacement.</li>
            <li> I have been using a Remington R-835 corded shaver for the last couple of years, and it&#x27;s been a very good shaver.  I&#x27;m mostly bald, and use the shaver for my beard and head several times a week.  So as the r-835&#x27;s cutters had gotten dull I started searching for replacement cutters.  Well the cutters cost about as much as a new shaver, and the 835 had been discontinued so I then found this model, the Flex 360.  Although it shaves pretty well, the design is so stupid and annoying that I had to describe it here.  Each of the 3 cutters flexes on it&#x27;s own and so does the head overall.  That seemed okay, but also the cutters are attached to the shaver with it&#x27;s own, individual cover.  Well I soon discovered that if I shave when my face is the slightest bit damp, or when it&#x27;s humid (bathroom after shower), that the covers can come undone and oops!  The cutter falls to the floor!  Also be cause of this stupid design, the whiskers don&#x27;t fall into the big space in the head underneath the cutters, no, instead they accumulate directly under the cutters.  As a result if I shave both head and beard, I 3 nice big donuts of hair under each cutter which have to be removed or the shaver sometimes won&#x27;t even go, it just stutters like there&#x27;s not enough power to spin the cutters.  It&#x27;s like you have to disassemble the shaver almost after every use!  I&#x27;m thinking of going to Ebay to find another r-835 or maybe a Norelco 6940, this one&#x27;s driving me nuts!  Remington, you screwed up here!    UPDATE - February 12, 2011  I am raising my rating from 1 to 2 stars now, not because the shaver miraculously improved, but because Remington has issued a replacement head that solves all of the above-noted problems.  I&#x27;ve reviewed it too here at Amazon, search for Remington Sprcdn Universal Rotary Replacement Shaver Head.  It looks like Remington is using this head on the newest cordless shavers, but I haven&#x27;t seen it on the corded version yet, which is too bad.  The shaver is REALLY good now, and works as well or better than any I&#x27;ve used in the past, whether Remington or Norelco.  If I was able to buy this corded shaver with the new head now, I would give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> While using the razor one of the rotary blades popped off and it was damaged as I was trying to put it back on. As I tried to put the one back on another popped off. Very poor design and way too easy to accidentally screw off the heads. Not easy to re-assemble.</li>
            <li> Can not keep the cutting heads on this thing! They pop off all the time and you have to find them. Then it is a royal pain in the___ to get it back in again. Wished my old Norelco that was 35 years old was still alive because it was way better then this thing!</li>
            <li> Bought this at \\&quot;W\\&quot; on a whim b/c it was cheap. I have to agree it hurts during and after shaving even mild stubble. It does give a close shave but I&#x27;d spend the extra $15 on something that has good reviews on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is beyond a doubt the worst rotary razor I have ever owned.  After having replaced an old Norelco with the only new Norelco available - which does not cut my beard - I chose to try a simple Remington.  While it does cut my beard, at least 75% of the time the heads and blades pop off.  This becomes a problem, because the blades become flying Ninga stars of death.  AVOID THIS SHAVER LIKE THE PLAGUE IT IS!</li>
            <li> this thing does not do well at all. If you havent shaved in two or three days, it yanks the stubs from their sockets, and does not cut well at all. I spent 30 minutes trying to shave and what I got was a sore face. My face is burning right now. After 30 minutes of trying to shave it still couldnt get my chin shaved. And cleaning it is also a pain since the hair get stuck in the razor themselves. This thing is WEAK. The little clipper it has shaves better than the razors. Im giving it a 2 for the clippers.</li>
            <li> Product works fine as far as shaving goes. It just doesn&#x27;t work for long. Mine worked for 3 days and the pins that drive the shaving wheels would only spin a little every time I turned it off and on. Not a value at 32$ for 3 days of shaving.     Taking it back and buying a higher end non-Remington brand.</li>
            <li> It pulls hair too hard and is irritating</li>
            <li> I got this shaver today as a Christmas gift.  It gets as close as a razor.  It did pinch a little in certain areas, but it seems to work well.    The only complaint I really had was that the protective cap doesnt actually fit on the thing, but other than that, it wasnt bad.  The design is corded, rather than cordless, so if that is not an issue for you, this is a great shaver!</li>
            <li> Not as good as the earlier models.</li>
            <li> Razor seems weak of motor and shaves marginal compared to it&#x27;s predecessor.  Since, at this price one can only expect the razor to last a year, user has no complaint in that regard.  However, this last razor came out of the box working poorly.&lt;br /&gt;Do wish that a better quality razor - non battery type - could be found.</li>
            <li> A great shaver at a great price works just as well as it all the expensive ones.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a week and find it to be adequate.  I&#x27;m sure there are cheaper versions that do the same thing, but this is fine.</li>
            <li> Very poor design. Very difficult to clean and reassemble -- cutter assembly difficult to disassemble, difficult to insert and reattach cutters, difficult to make the thing go at all if you manage to get that far. Not worth the aggravation. Get a Norelco.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used a Norelco shaver but decided to try this brand as it was a little cheaper.  You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Mine is dead just after about 10 uses. Remington support says \\&quot;replace the battery\\&quot; but mine runs off DC... there is no battery... Plus when it was working it wasn&#x27;t a pleasant shave as the motor is weak and the floating head is inconveniently made. Remington allegedly makes their products to soon fail so we buy new again and again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I called their support again, at a different number and told them my experience. I was going to ask them some more questions, but the lady on the support line at Madison, Wisconsin hung up on me. Seems that they just wrote me off as a customer. Both times during the calls they did not apologize and did not ask if I had further questions and concerns. I strongly recommend everyone to AVOID REMINGTON at all costs and times!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No more Remington brand for me, ever! I&#x27;ll try a Japanese brand that&#x27;s made in Japan.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been an electric razor user for years and this is as good or better than any other razors I have used.  I prefer the corded razors because you never have to worry about a dead battery.</li>
            <li> Advantages:&lt;br /&gt;IT&#x27;S QUIET.  Never seen no razor this quiet.&lt;br /&gt;Dis: It has to be plugged in to the wall, interrupts movie night.&lt;br /&gt;ADV: It&#x27;s lightweight, no battery and charger to wear out.  Straight AC.&lt;br /&gt;DIS: Takes forever to shave close.  Forever.&lt;br /&gt;ADV: Haven&#x27;t had to use the supplied trimmer yet.  The blades knock down the high hair FAST.&lt;br /&gt;DIS: Tugs a bit more to get to the short hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary:  A nice cheap razor for not waking others.  A fast shave, and a fast 3:00 Shadow (some folks like that).  You&#x27;d have to work for a &#x27;clean&#x27; shave with this one.  I shave hard at night, and quickie in the morning.  Very early morning, when silence is king.  I&#x27;m on a budget and this one has worked for me.  Easily the quietest razor I&#x27;ve ever owned, including straight blades.  Think sink, it&#x27;s quieter.  Can&#x27;t speak to longevity/cost of the blades or anything - really though, replacement screens/blades almost ALWAYS cost as much as a new razor.  Straight AC only, I have to watch that cord.  Owned/used for one month 6th electric razor used.</li>
