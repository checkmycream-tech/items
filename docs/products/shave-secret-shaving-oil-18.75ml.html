            <li>Great product !</li>
            <li>/&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Produces an excellent shave.  </li>
            <li>I could get my hands on to see what worked best (for me of course).  </li>

            <li>If you shave every day this bottle would be awesome!</li>
            <li>Best shave ever.  </li>

            <li>so it is still my best shave.</li>
            <li>Best shave</li>
            <li>I have been very happy with that razor.  </li>
            <li>He says this is the best product he has ever tried.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not the greatest discovery ever, as represented by the radio commercials.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great product!!</li>
            <li>Best shave product ever!!!</li>
            <li>I use the excellent [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>This stuff is the best thing I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>it the best shave ever!!!!</li>
            <li>Product is perfect and works great, I hope they didn&#x27;t stop producing it!</li>
            <li>I think this oil is a very good choice for me.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how it would work with those 20-blade, high-tech, spring-loaded, razors made from unicorn horn and priced accordingly, but for the old-school DE Safety, it was very good.  </li>
            <li>Very good, protects the skin as it claims, no nicks or cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also found with this oil that even cheaper razors now give a very good shave.  </li>
            <li>The aroma isn&#x27;t very good.  </li>
            <li>Great Price, Great Product!</li>
            <li>The shaving creme was incredible in that it gave me a closer shave than ever.</li>
            <li>This is the best way to shave that I have found, and it&#x27;s great for travel too, because I can keep a bottle in my travel baggie and not think about it when I&#x27;m packing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really good stuff!</li>
            <li>I cannot tell you how delighted I am with this product!  </li>
            <li>Good stuff!</li>
            <li>It does smell good though!</li>
            <li>Good job with this product!</li>
            <li>Plus, it smells great and feels good!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as good as the Art of Shaving oil, but it&#x27;s still very good and it will help your shave.</li>
            <li>This works great.</li>
            <li>I still use shaving cream after applying this oil, and it works great.</li>
            <li>Great product that I have been using know for about a year.</li>
            <li>And the results were great.</li>
            <li>The product is great, but spendy.</li>
            <li>C.O. Bigelow which is great)</li>
            <li>Great stuff.  </li>
            <li>I was perfectly happy with my old-fashioned safety razor and soap &amp; brush combo.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is great.  </li>
            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>Great way to get a close shave</li>
            <li>This product works great for me.</li>
            <li>My head feels great</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Then I had a Braun electric high-end model, which I was really happy with.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s great, no nicks or cuts, surpasses gels</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t work that great with my waterproof electric, but I like that u can reactivate it by re-wetting your face.</li>
            <li>In addition to convenience, it provides a great shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This stuff is great.  </li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>I use this on my legs and bikini area, and it works great.</li>
            <li>This is great</li>
            <li>I used 6 to 9 drops to shave and it feels great</li>
            <li>Plus it smells great</li>
            <li>This stuff works great.</li>
            <li>It smells great and you don&#x27;t have to rinse anything off except your razor.</li>
            <li>Great stuff, will be reorder as soon as I get close to running out.</li>
            <li>Too bad--it sounds great.  </li>
            <li>This stuff works great for both razors and electric razors.</li>
            <li>I also found that putting water in the sink with a samll amount of hand soap and pre-rinsing the razor in said soapy water greatly helps with preventing oil/hair build up on the blade.</li>
            <li>This is a great product.  </li>
            <li>If $$ does it for you, then you&#x27;ll be happy with this one.</li>
            <li>I have to say, it worked great.</li>
            <li>Great shave with this.........</li>

            <li>lol.  </li>
            <li>Not even great.</li>
            <li>But it works great underneath shaving cream.</li>
            <li>I can honestly say this is the best shave I have ever had.  </li>
            <li>Then I read about this stuff &amp; thought I&#x27;d give it a try &amp; it works great.</li>

            <li>this works great.  </li>
            <li>The menthol also gives a cooling sensation which feels GREAT.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy I tried it....</li>
            <li>The stuff does a great job from a shaving software standpoint.  </li>

            <li>This stuff is great.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li>AND it is effective on rashes, too!</li>
            <li>Smells nice too!</li>
            <li>Had to apply more than recommended amount to get the best shave our of it.</li>
            <li>For swimsuit occassions, I will be keeping this handy though!</li>
            <li>Put some more on and massaged it in real good.</li>
            <li>Smells good, feels good, and will make your skin feel great.</li>
            <li>It does give quite a close shave, and is a pleasant smell (unless you don&#x27;t like clove/menthol-y smelling things).    </li>

            <li>The fragrance is pleasant.</li>

            <li>The smell is pleasant, with the dominant smell of cloves.</li>
            <li>pleasant smell:</li>
            <li>It feels good on your skin and has a pleasant odor.&lt;br /&gt;-I have used this product 4 times and have yet to get a nick or any razor burn.  </li>
            <li>thought I had found a great shaving cream that was all natural, smelled wonderful, and was very good for my skin.  </li>
            <li>Smells good</li>
            <li>If this works for you or others, good -</li>
            <li>The shave is as good as razor blade with almost zero irritation.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Happily I&#x27;ve also found it to be a good moisturizer too.</li>
            <li>this product I picked up at walmart and I cant believe how good it is...</li>
            <li>It did do a good job as a pre-shave.</li>
            <li>Works nice, great product.</li>
            <li>Good seller, The item delivered on time, was as described.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s good for shaver.  </li>
            <li>: This is a good product because it works well</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll be good.</li>
            <li>but it did a really good job</li>
            <li>Smells really good though</li>
            <li>For medium to light bears, this would be the best product for you.</li>
            <li>its cheap, is long-lasting, and is literally the best shaving product I&#x27;ve ever used since i started shaving.</li>
            <li>When I&#x27;m done, I massage my face again and call it good.</li>
            <li>but it works good on my legs if I use a hand razor.  </li>
            <li>Good soap shaves closer for me.</li>
            <li>, then another, then I started smiling, I may have even audibly laughed.</li>
            <li>thought would be good for travel since it is so compact.  </li>
            <li>it does work fairly well as described.  </li>
            <li>and it smells good.</li>
            <li>This product is quite good.</li>
            <li>The product description sounds so good I was tempted to order some.  </li>
            <li>Then found it so good, that I use it even when not traveling.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t tried a blade, but I&#x27;d expect similarly good results, as I noticed with TSS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>I am now a believer and can say good bye to nicks, cuts, and burns.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a good practice to use the alum bar because it serves as a good indicator for when you need to replace your razor blade.  </li>
            <li>It also feels good after the shave, I guess from the menthol.</li>
            <li>Feels good too.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li>Works surprisingly well with my Panasonic ELS63 shaver that can also be used with water.</li>
            <li>Good Stuff.  </li>
            <li>It is fantastic for travel, though, so I keep it in my travel kit along with the Venus Snap razor, and the combination is excellent.</li>
            <li>The oil from &amp;#34;Art of Shaving&amp;#34; is way overpriced and this stuff works just as good.</li>
            <li>I do not think its a good product at all.</li>
            <li>this is really as good as I think it is.</li>
            <li>works great.could&#x27;nt believe how good it works.</li>
            <li>Just use a good safety razor, badger brush, quality cream/soap, and a good after-shave balm.</li>
            <li>Gave it as a gift, my friend loved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The oil tends to stay on my face and can be a good thing in winter</li>
            <li>my skin feel really good.</li>
            <li>Still looking for a good all-natural shaving gel.</li>
            <li>Plus the smell of it is good too.</li>
            <li>The oil does a good job as advertised.</li>
            <li>I bought this based on all the good reviews.</li>
            <li>The oil is supposedly good for your skin.  </li>
            <li>The oil is supposedly good for your skin.  </li>
            <li>Works good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good</li>
            <li>Gives you a good shave</li>
            <li>but this is good</li>
            <li>My husband just loved it and we will be reordering.</li>
            <li>Now I am good to go.</li>
            <li>Drop control is good.</li>
            <li>Excellent, everything said about it (good) was true.</li>
            <li>Not a bad choice, but not the best choice.</li>
            <li>This is effective, and generally pleasantly scented.  </li>
            <li>It was delivered quickly and was packaged flawlessly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m a very satisfied customer.</li>
            <li>My skin feels great and is as smooth as a babies bottom!    </li>
            <li>/&gt;Shaving is great and better than with aerosol foam.</li>
            <li>Save even more money on this great product.</li>
            <li>I get an incredibly close smooth shave with no irritation</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think a fly can sit on your face after and they will fall :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very glad I read through some of the reviews and Q &amp; A</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use more than a smidge, it works great.</li>
            <li>Although it is not as &amp;#34;thick&amp;#34; as the oil I had been using, buying a bottle for $7 as opposed to $25 or more was attractive to me</li>
            <li>Great product love it</li>
            <li>Great stuff, I have been using it for many years.....</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant spicy aroma and washes away very easily without leaving your face feeling oily or dehydrated.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Works better than any pre-shave I ever used!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>This stuff is phenomenal!</li>
            <li>Used it for the first time today and it worked great!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t ask for anything more!</li>
            <li>But the best use of this product is as a first layer --</li>
            <li>More please!</li>
            <li>Use more than the bottle says!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Going to spread the word even more!</li>
            <li>Glad I have Amazon Prime!</li>
            <li>Way too many pimples after using the shaving oil!</li>
            <li>Otherwise I would have said XX product worked better than this!</li>
            <li>for 6 months with Fusion razor, then purchased two more, and shipped to my Father and Brother.&lt;br /&gt;Enough said!</li>
            <li>This is a great product that makes shaving so easy.</li>
            <li>It is an oil that with three drops does a better job than a hand full of the best shaving cream.</li>
            <li>Makes his life more pleasant.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell of the oil is pleasant, but it is not something that most men would like to wear to work.  </li>
            <li>Once I got used to what I was seeing, the shave went very smooth, felt good even.  </li>
            <li>This stuffs amazing.</li>
            <li>Words cannot describe how amazing this product is.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li>Simply amazing.</li>
            <li>product is simply amazing.</li>
            <li>What was really amazing though was how well it kept up.</li>
            <li>Simple, effective, and best of all, a GREAT SHAVE.  </li>
            <li>This is an amazing product.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>That amazing tingling feeling I get as I rub the lotion on the skin</li>
            <li>I use it with shave cream to get an amazing shave with no nicks or cuts,  </li>
            <li>The product it&#x27;s great, leaves your skin smooth and no irriting I use at shower everything datos since I recibe</li>
            <li>but this stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li>My husband says this stuff is amazing</li>
            <li>I liked the scent and the ease of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>do feel that I end up using a fair amount more than they recommend.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I purchased it to help keep a good edge on my beard by keeping it more visible than under shaving cream and it does that</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good stuff, but you will have to use more than recommended in the directions.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own.  </li>
            <li>I tried this product with a 5 blade razor and it gave a very close shave,the best part of all no irritation!</li>
            <li>It really is the best.</li>
            <li>I got a nice, close shave (no nicks.. knock on wood).  </li>
            <li>It is also nice to see the skin not covered by foam.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but makes for a nice addition to my routine.</li>
            <li>I tried it as an electric pre-shave, but didn&#x27;t find it as effective as with a blade.</li>
            <li>Nice to find a product that exceeds expectations.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice that there is no need to rinse though.  </li>
            <li>Nice smell too.</li>
            <li>Nice scent.</li>
            <li>The clove scent is nice and not overpowering.</li>
            <li>Smells nice though.  </li>
            <li>The scent is nice, it lubricates well, and it is compact which is handy for travel.  </li>
            <li>Best product by far to enhance a Good Shave and head towards Exellence.  </li>
            <li>kind of a lemon/peppermint smell is the closest I can describe it.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what kind of miracle snake oil is in this stuff</li>
            <li>Nice to have a product</li>
            <li>Mix with water and provides a nice shave and tingling feeling</li>
            <li>I was expecting it to feel like oil, but honestly I couldn&#x27;t tell I had anything on my skin at all.</li>
            <li>I will always have to own this now.</li>
            <li>It does have a nice scent.</li>
            <li>And most of the time it was accompanied by a fair amount of razor burn.</li>
            <li>To each their own.</li>
            <li>I liked my mug&amp;brush.  </li>
            <li>But an oil rather than a cream does make the skin feel nice and prevents the irritation that often accompanies shaving.</li>
            <li>and I liked the fragrance of it.  </li>
            <li>So, there&#x27;s another nice</li>
            <li>Nice scent too.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell too nice either.</li>
            <li>Nice for pre-shave.</li>
            <li>Adds a nice cooling layer of lubrication.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li>and this bottle is always handy.</li>
            <li>I honestly don&#x27;t know how they are aloud to make these claims.</li>
            <li>Kind of a nice, multi-purpose oil to keep around.  </li>
            <li>The menthol makes for a nice tingly sensation.</li>
            <li>Put some Foamy over top and it worked fairly well that way.</li>
            <li>Absolutely the best I&#x27;ve used for shaving (I use a safety razor).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li>good and is a nice oil :)</li>
            <li>Fragrance is nice and the menthol didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>Smells nice, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>that you can get this a lot cheaper at Walmart, but as a product this one is really nice.</li>
            <li>A Panasonic model that came with its own cleaning system.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s nice, works well</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been all over using safety razors cartridges and any kind of cream I could find.</li>
            <li>With Harry&#x27;s blade and Proraso soap I was getting a nice shave, even though it didn&#x27;t seem quite as close as I thought it could be.</li>
            <li>But the price was right (and reviews incredible), so I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>works great and smells pretty good too</li>
            <li>Plus it&#x27;s a very mild pleasant smell,</li>
            <li>Seems very suitable as a pre-shave oil for electric, but I could see clogging becoming an issue.</li>
            <li>On a positive note this product smells great; clove is certainly a good winter scent.</li>
            <li>This stuff is pretty incredible.</li>
            <li>I was super happy with the results.</li>
            <li>Anyway, since it IS oil, good luck gripping your razor with a safe grip.</li>
            <li>A quick rinse and I smell great</li>
            <li>I was very surprised but also very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li>-  This is very easy to do.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall, a great product that is good for your shaver and your face!</li>
            <li>Very good with straight razors.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t believe this product isn&#x27;t more popular.  </li>
            <li>It gives a good smooth covering on the face.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s formula isn&#x27;t as good as others available.</li>
            <li>Oh ya, this is by far the best for shaving.</li>
            <li>We ended up getting 2 more bottles because it is so cost-efficient and effective on the face.</li>
            <li>Does a nice job and makes shaving with an electric razor much more efficient.</li>
            <li>I get a comfortable shave every time, it takes up no space in my medicine cabinet, and it smells good.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m impressed</li>
            <li>but wow what a great product!</li>
            <li>The oil itself is ok, nothing spectacular.</li>
            <li>The first time I used this I couldn&#x27;t believe how good it felt because I had never had a shaving experience as good as this</li>
            <li>That easy!</li>
            <li>- This sounds ridiculously easy to do, BUT in practice it&#x27;s NOT!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Inexpensive plus high quality adds up to a very good value for this frugal Scottsman.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell is mild, not offensive, I would say pleasant-</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how they came up with this, but it really works: smells good, feels good, does the job.</li>
            <li>It has a mild, pleasant smell and if you use an electric shaver like I do, it keeps the mechanics of the shaver oiled as well.</li>
            <li>It smells nice, it gives a good amount of lubrication and the price is right.</li>
            <li>But when you&#x27;re in the field, you don&#x27;t have hot water, a badger brush, and your great grandpa&#x27;s pewter shaving mug, do you?</li>
            <li>When I first saw it, I thought it would be great for travel, but now I use it all the time.</li>
            <li>I knew the claims were to good to be true.</li>
            <li>Apart from a mild, pleasant aroma and a refreshing tingle, this does nothing for</li>
            <li>The awesome clover scent is very earthy and clean -</li>
            <li>I got this oil from Walmart at a very cheap rate $ 3.82 ( 0.67 OZ&#x3D; 18.7 ml).</li>
            <li>very smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel very smooth.</li>
            <li>Highly Recommended and a must have for a good shave!  </li>
            <li>Has a nice clove scent, not too strong and doesn&#x27;t linger.</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and in good condition and was given to my husband.</li>
            <li>Has a real cool interesting smell.  </li>
            <li>The packaging was beautiful, the price was right, the flexible head on the Harry&#x27;s razor comfortably followed the contours of my face</li>
            <li>I lather up some Proraso with filtered water and out it on top of this for a very smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>So far, Very good.</li>
            <li>Worthless...soap worked better.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting better shaves than ever and zero irritation.</li>
            <li>I have always been satisfied with the closeness of the shave on my face.  </li>
            <li>I have been able to even get those sideways hairs on my adams apple.  </li>
            <li>The best part about this stuff is that you can actually see what you are doing because there is no foam or soap lather.     </li>
            <li>A bottle lasts more then a month.</li>
            <li>I had to use a minimum of 10 drops, and could have used more.</li>
            <li>They love it too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Will be purchasing more and telling my friends about</li>
            <li>I really love this product, and have bought over 20 bottles and sent it to my home country, for dad, dad-in-law and others.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is much better than any foam I have used</li>
            <li>Its just OK...</li>
            <li>Bought a bottle for my best friend who had the same experience.</li>
            <li>Once I cut pack and just used 2 drops in each palm, I got better gliding and</li>
            <li>sure why it&#x27;s like $6 online</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I picked this up at the store.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t require many precious water bottles for the post shave rinse.</li>
            <li>(and for the most part would not reccommend) using aresols with this product.  </li>
            <li>He loves it and we will be buying more when he runs out.</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t been able to work up a lather with oil,</li>
            <li>Seems to work ok.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s much better</li>
            <li>; you get many mores shaves out of seven cans of cream than you&#x27;ll get out of this bottle</li>
            <li>Oil is better.  </li>
            <li>This product will even work well for women for shaving their legs, really comfortable and close shave!</li>
            <li>But if you can&#x27;t wait just wash your face after you shave. :)</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Well I am able to shave against the grain with no razor bumps and have a smoother shave as a result.</li>
            <li>I find that I need to use more than 3-5 drops per use - I</li>
            <li>After my face got used to the blade, it get a nice smooth shave with no cuts.</li>
            <li>The smell is interesting -</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>It works well, slightly better than Crew shaving oil.</li>
            <li>Using a shaving gel or cream on top of oil helps, but not neccessary.</li>
            <li>Using more water is also helpful.</li>
            <li>The container could be made more aesthetic (as you can see it resembles a glue from Home Depot or WalMart).</li>
            <li>But the Africa&#x27;s Herbal does too for tons cheaper plus leaves me better moisturized than the Kinexium.  </li>
            <li>I use it mostly to shave my head.</li>
            <li>Razor rash on my neck most of the day.  </li>
            <li>Once I get the appropriate amount 10-15 drops it works well.</li>
            <li>But it def takes way more than 5 drops</li>
            <li>Love the smell.</li>
            <li>This is not anti pimple cream, Nair or magic, like some people expect.</li>
            <li>Better how?</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Because this is an oil, rather than a cream, you&#x27;ll need to rinse out your razor more.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Works OK.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>This has made it so much better.</li>
            <li>I use more than the bottle recommends though.</li>
            <li>Works OK, but overhyped by Hannity, et al.</li>
            <li>I initially tried this once without reading the instructions and wasn&#x27;t impressed.</li>
            <li>I was able to shave over my chin without ripping out my porcupine bristles.</li>
            <li>It was sooo smooth!</li>
            <li>and when I touched my head I was dumbfounded that my skin was also so smooth!   </li>
            <li>I went with 3 more drops for the rest of my face</li>
            <li>But as for my head, it was cut free!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>But it takes more like 10-15 drops.</li>
            <li>Used more and it clogs the razor</li>
            <li>Well, it takes more like 10-12 drops.</li>
            <li>Even more so when I put the recommend 5 drops into my hands and spread it on.</li>
            <li>My husband said that u have to use more than it says.</li>
            <li>but then I apply my shaving soap with a brush over the oil and that delivers a fantastic shave!</li>
            <li>Love the idea and reviews.</li>
            <li>favorite part is the post shave burn is gone.</li>
            <li>I wish I had ordered more than one bottle</li>
            <li>and yes I will be buying more.</li>
            <li>but you need to put more than 3 drops.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Lubricates the skin and prevents cuts and razor burn way better than any shaving cream I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>He ended up using more than the recommended dosage</li>
            <li>This stuff is awesome and you need just a tiny amount.</li>
            <li>Additionally, razor stubble gets clogged in multibladed razors which require more than rinsing for removal.  </li>
            <li>and it works better than any shave cream or soap I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also tried using it with much more than that.</li>
            <li>won&#x27;t be buying more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sticking to &#x27;em. :)</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to use it many times to get the benefits...</li>
            <li>this is better than a shave cream and allows me to shape my beard as there is no foam which covers my face.</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>you, many others are okay.  </li>
            <li>its OK.</li>
            <li>.. I will now have to check prices more often before I purchase ..</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pleased with the purchase and will buy again.</li>
            <li>Now I can shave more often.  </li>
            <li>in combination with shaving cream, it&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>For the price you can&#x27;t find a better shaving oil.</li>
            <li>Yes, you could pay a lot more.</li>
            <li>Is much better than the \\&quot;King of Shaves\\&quot; oil which i&#x27;ve also tried.  </li>
            <li>Four stars because of the size of the bottle; a larger size would make this product perfect.</li>
            <li>It will work without water, but for me it works better with water.  </li>
            <li>A three or five ounce bottle would be so much more practical.</li>
            <li>But, after using this oil, my face was smooth, with no cuts, nicks or burns!  </li>
            <li>My wife loves my smooth face!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be ordering more when I run out.</li>
            <li>You can still get the job done - but more attention is needed.</li>
            <li>I found myself using more than the recommended</li>
            <li>Aside from many shaving creams and soaps, I&#x27;ve tried some oils and gels as well.</li>
            <li>After shaving I use a couple more drops as an after-shave and I&#x27;m on my way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>sure if it has been mentioned, but using this product extends the life of a razor by a week</li>
            <li>recommend you don&#x27;t use more than four drops.</li>
            <li>Absolutely phenomenal product, love it.  </li>
            <li>I found it in Target and thought it looked interesting.</li>
            <li>and I wasn&#x27;t able to wash it off, even with soap.</li>
            <li>allows for a good shave with electric razor and more useful than shaving cream.</li>
            <li>I, like many others, had my doubts about this stuff.</li>
            <li>The results were better</li>
            <li>I need more like eight.</li>
            <li>and it was ok.</li>
            <li>We are going to be ordering more for family members.</li>
            <li>Christmas present win!</li>
            <li>01-30-15  Gets better and better.</li>
            <li>It seems the more you use it, the softer and better it feels.</li>
            <li>Fantastic shave!</li>
            <li>More power to those who get some use out of it,</li>
            <li>Just follow the directions and like it says, rewet your face (or whatever you are shaving) and go over it one more time.</li>
            <li>it laughs at most razors and punishes me for shaving.</li>
            <li>This is something gels and creams have NEVER been able to do for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus</li>
            <li>Wasting more time during your shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I apply more?</li>
            <li>Boy am I glad I did.</li>
            <li>ok if I use a lot more than 3 drops.  </li>
            <li>Make sure to follow the directions and add more water after adding the oil.</li>
            <li>the product states if you require more lubrication to apply more water rather than product....</li>
            <li>more water: check...</li>
            <li>Ive used shaving (talc) powder sticks for 20 years with a norelco shaver and now I switched to a panasonic 4 bar blades and I tried the oil stuff to see if it is better.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>I ordered two more bottles and gave them to friends.  </li>
            <li>I bought 2 and use more than the recommended amount.  </li>
            <li>This stuff just works .... and smells much better than 20 weight. &#x27;)</li>
            <li>Another satisfied customer, and one who&#x27;ll return.</li>
            <li>There is no point in it, it works better on</li>
            <li>Whether 3 drops/5 drops/15 drops, more water/less water....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just OK..</li>
            <li>glad i discovered it ..</li>
            <li>I have never had so many cuts on my face in my life.  </li>
            <li>This stuff works well and allows you to see what you are shaving much better than lathered cream.  </li>
            <li>It works better on some days than others.  </li>
            <li>It is as though it is more viscous some days than others.</li>
            <li>It does take me more than the advertised 3 drops, but maybe that&#x27;s just me.</li>
            <li>My favorite after shave is Osage Rub for this task.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a gal, and I love using it for my legs.</li>
            <li>I am certainly glad I did.  </li>
            <li>and my skin is much better moisturized by the oil.</li>
            <li>just okay;</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t hurt that&#x27;s for sure, but....</li>
            <li>it had a better smell, it would be 5 stars.&lt;br</li>
            <li>get a better shave with this oil alone.  </li>
            <li>Shave with the grain, apply more water and shave against the grain.  </li>
            <li>Like magic.</li>
            <li>Way better than shaving cream.</li>
            <li>me, I will just keep using the better shaving soaps and use this for</li>
            <li>Now, when I use the product before shaving, my face feels smooth, and nice after shaving.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>Definitely better than soap and more moisturizing than foams or gels.</li>
            <li>I like that you don&#x27;t have to add more product to your face,</li>
            <li>ordering more.</li>
            <li>You do need more than three drops.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lot better than using foam with an electric shaver (yes, I tried that route and it just didn&#x27;t work well for me).</li>
            <li>After turning 57 I finally enjoyed shaving.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is 1000x better than any shaving cream.</li>
            <li>I saw this and figured, the most I had to lose was $3.</li>
            <li>It seems to work ok</li>
            <li>The razor glides over my skin better than with shaving cream</li>
            <li>Is it magic?  </li>
            <li>product works much better than most shaving foams.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps the best routine is to shave prior to taking your morning shower.  </li>
            <li>How did it manage to remain under the radar of most men?  </li>
            <li>Perhaps the best routine is to shave prior to taking your morning shower.  </li>
            <li>How did it manage to remain under the radar of most men?  </li>
            <li>Seemed to have to go over it again more after using the shave oil as opposed to not using it at all.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s keeps skin most.</li>
            <li>Ok, I had read the reviews, so I felt I had to try the product.  </li>
            <li>(Be sure to rinse your razor often)&lt;br</li>
            <li>So I suspect I didn&#x27;t get the product evenly distributed, which accounts for the difference in it working better in some areas than others.  </li>
            <li>There are much better products out there.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>You have to make sure you do NOT use any pressure.</li>
            <li>Make sure you use a lot of water.</li>
            <li>But use it under a quality shave cream/lotion etc and it makes the shave 10X better than the cream alone.</li>
            <li>Just bought two more for backup.    </li>
            <li>Great for a fast touch-up-and-go.</li>
            <li>By better</li>
            <li>way better than shaving cream.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Works best when following directions:*</li>
            <li>/&gt;Best beard conditioner (most astringent):</li>
            <li>I also feel like King of Shaves lubricates my face better and spreads easier which lets me use the recommended 3 drops vs. the 5 or 6</li>
            <li>First of all, the smell isn&#x27;t that pleasant.</li>
            <li>This stuff works and is soooo much cheaper and better for you than ANY can of shave cream!!</li>
            <li>It really works and it smells fantastic!!!</li>
            <li>It gave me a great shave, was easy to use, did not clog up my razor, and left my skin free of irritation and feeling great.</li>
            <li>Also, clean your razor&#x27;s blades under warm running water while shaving.  </li>
            <li>Has a nice menthol after effect which leaves your face feeling clean and refreshed.  </li>
            <li>I get a very clean shave with it.</li>
            <li>I found that it is great to use along with the shaving gel I normally use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m guessing because of the menthos component you face feels nice and cool after the shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Some people have reviewed that they don&#x27;t like the smell of it, I think it smells pretty good</li>
            <li>When I first bought this for my son, I had no idea if it was any good.  </li>
            <li>It is pretty good.  </li>
            <li>Works pretty darn good.</li>
            <li>Most easy and efficient.</li>
            <li>Quickly rinse my face with warm water</li>
            <li>I love the smell and it is strong.</li>
            <li>This oil is just awesome for shaving as it is thinner and slicker and makes the shave so much quicker but really sticks to my skin and keeps me from breaking out keeping me moisturized for hours and hours after the shave.  </li>
            <li>Ever since I heard a hairstylist say this was her secret to the best head shave ever at a charity headshaving event, I was happy that I discovered this product.</li>
            <li>I shaved with a straight razor for a year and liked it, but the time it took for me to do a good job without threatening my own life was a bit much.</li>
            <li>I find this added barrier of lubrication very important and comfortable.</li>
            <li>It certainly doesn&#x27;t feel this good after a shave.)</li>
            <li>The eucalyptus smell is nice, not too strong, and fades fairly quickly, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about smelling like a plant.</li>
            <li>I have heard this stuff works great when adding a drop to regular lather, but honestly I&#x27;ve been fine with it by itself.  </li>
            <li>I use this as pre-shave and still use a badger brush and shaving cream, on top of it, it makes a huge difference</li>
            <li>I love the menthol \\&quot;burn\\&quot; and I notice that even with a used blade I get a smooth, ultra-close shave.  </li>
            <li>AND - you&#x27;ll enjoy the shave more than with this stuff.</li>
            <li>It gave me the closest and most comfortable shave I have ever had.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great scent that makes me smell like a man, not a twelve year old</li>
            <li>i wasnt sure how smooth it would be for my straihgt</li>
            <li>Wow, this stuff is really great.</li>
            <li>This tiny bottle is full of the best idea ever.</li>
            <li>This is the smoothest and most cut free ever</li>
            <li>, (3) shave with a safety/straight razor, (4) lightly rinse, apply more shaving cream, (5)</li>
            <li>the oil makes the face soft and it shaves great</li>
            <li>The most comfortable shave I have ever had with a razor.</li>
            <li>Wish it was available in more stores tho.</li>
            <li>I enjoy shaving and most mornings</li>
            <li>The best way to use is wet</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got my closest, most comfortable shaves using a Schick Quattro razor with a four blade (plus edger) titanium refill cartridge.</li>
            <li>but no... dont care much for the smell, and i dont think it is good at all... doesnt slide well on skin, and doesnt shave any closer than anything else ive tried...</li>
            <li>could it really be THAT good?  </li>
            <li>the added hassle of cleaning the razor is worth the nice close shave.</li>
            <li>Super effective at helping to provide a comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>The only reason I did not give it the perfect 5 stars is that it can be a bit stubborn to get rid of out of your razor blades, but definitely not impossible.</li>
            <li>My husband has very sensitive skin and has tried many products for a good shave.</li>
            <li>It seems to work well as the first coating and to my knolwedge has provided a good clean shave.</li>
            <li>I found this based on other Amazon reviews and tried it and am truly impressed with the results.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It works better than anything else I have tried and has significantly reduced after shave</li>
            <li>I have used all the best shave creams along with my trusty $200 Feather DE razor and have tried all kinds of shaving products but this little bottle of oil is my most prized shaving product.  </li>
            <li>oil - you may have to re-clean your hands and face pores if your skin clogs easily</li>
            <li>using this product be sure to tap out your razor often, and clean it thoroughly when you are done.</li>
            <li>Did I mention easy to use?  </li>
            <li>smooth as silk and the closest most comfortable</li>
            <li>easily could.  </li>
            <li>the most comfortable, smooth shave ever!&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>This does not rinse off easily  </li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t like clove / menthol you may not like the smell, but SS goes on easy and the smell does not linger.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Does Not shave off as easily as described, does leave face feeling good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Another benefit is that I can easily see my stubble in case</li>
            <li>This product allows me to change the style easily as often as I want .</li>
            <li>This is an all in one,makes shaving easy and helps with irritation.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s as easy as that.</li>
            <li>If I have been good and shaving daily it is a nice shave</li>
            <li>It can clog up the blades of the razor if you don&#x27;t have strong water pressure.</li>
            <li>Has a somewhat strong scent that I like, but might not be to others liking.</li>
            <li>Nothing is perfect obviously, but this a step in the right direction.  </li>
            <li>It just adds gunk the first swipe and won&#x27;t be effective anymore.</li>
            <li>Kind of akward at first.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love it, but it&#x27;s not bad.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s just fine.</li>
            <li>18.75ML...worked fine</li>
            <li>and it worked fine--</li>
            <li>It is light and it spreads easily across the beard.  </li>
            <li>Works fine every time.</li>
            <li>The overly-positive reviews are true, this oil is magical and amazingly cheap.</li>
            <li>I got a free trial of this and tried it out and couldn&#x27;t believe how easy the shave was.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is fine.</li>
            <li>Also, i you want to get a super close shave or want to &amp;#34;re-energize&amp;#34; the oil on your face, you do not use more oil.</li>
            <li>I can truthfully say that  a super smooth baby skin scalp is the result.</li>
            <li>I was a little reluctant to purchase this when I saw it at Walmart but the words on the packaging just got the best of me</li>
            <li>Not buying it then was a huge mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smooth, simple, and smells great.  </li>
            <li>I honestly wasn&#x27;t expecting much, but this gives me an effortless, smooth shave with a safety razor using feather blades.  </li>
            <li>Huge rip off to buy online.</li>
            <li>Was looking for something fast and effective.  </li>
            <li>But it was free</li>
            <li>and you will get an ultra smooth feeling skin after.</li>
            <li>More than worth the cost.</li>
            <li>that silky smooth razor</li>
            <li>Its amazing, works really well, has made shaving a pleasure as opposed to a chore.</li>

            <li>(okay, it&#x27;s just an old Tupperware container filled with some warm water )</li>
            <li>had I not got a sample in a goodie bag for free.  </li>

            <li>One problem with this oil when used on the legs is that you can&#x27;t see where there is no oil, so the shave is not as smooth.</li>

            <li>like a close, smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt shave.</li>
            <li>enjoy shaving for once in your life.</li>
            <li>What the oil does is allow the razor, whether it be foil or blade, to glide smoothly on the skin.  </li>
            <li>This is important because you do not always get all of the hair in one pass.  </li>
            <li>Enjoy your shave.</li>
            <li>This product genuinely changed my life.</li>
            <li>I think that baby oil or good old soap make for a smoother shave.</li>
            <li>I use a DE89bl razor and this product while good and functional, did not appear to be any better than my current canned cream.</li>
            <li>I shave in the shower and find that body wash is far superior than this oil.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is AWESOME, you have to try it, you won&#x27;t believe much of a difference this makes shaving, especially if you shave your head!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is not messy and smells good.</li>
            <li>I shave both with multi-blades and when i can a good old DE, and it works well with both styles of shaving.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised that it works fairly well.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is good shaving oil - The smell is reminisent of Old Spice.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smells cinnamon, strongly, but I&#x27;m willing to cope with that until they come out with a blend of oils that smells better.</li>
            <li>But if you use a &amp;#34;safety razor&amp;#34;, a razor with only one blade then you can get a very nice smooth shave with this oil.</li>
            <li>There are some other oils that are very good as well...</li>
            <li>I really does give a nice clean cut that is smooth.</li>
            <li>This stuff is for real!!!</li>
            <li>It was my first shave with NO nicks or cuts!!</li>
            <li>This doesnt completly solve the problem but together with nice exfoliaiton and straight razor I can control the problem for a close clean shave.5 stars no doubnt about it</li>
            <li>I like to take out Roamers with a smooth, clean face.    </li>
            <li>Wow, first off the stuff smells great.  </li>
            <li>I was able to feel the smoothness and enjoy it in first use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>- So you try to shave as normal, and in my experience some areas it works OK (just ok), and in others</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend over this one in particular, but it still holds its own.</li>
            <li>This is the best stuff!I&#x27;ve been using an old style double edge razor for a few years now and have searched for the perfect shave for a while.</li>
            <li>Previous to discovering Africa&#x27;s Herbal oil for shaving I was most happy with King of Shaves Kinexium.  </li>
            <li>Works great, as long as you continually rinse off your razor.</li>
            <li>I also noticed a significant decrease in in-grown hairs.  </li>
            <li>I have the most consistently close shaves ever.  </li>
            <li>I still would get an occasionaal abrasion, but it was a significant imrpovement, and now my preferred method.</li>
            <li>original bottle from the summer is just about to run out.</li>
            <li>but it sure does a great job especially if you pair it with a good sharp razor.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like paying $9 for anything with ML in the volume description, but I&#x27;m pretty sure</li>
            <li>I originally purchased this for traveling</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know why this product isn&#x27;t more mainstream, it still seems pretty elusive.</li>
            <li>This would be an unique Holiday gift.</li>
            <li>(yes, you have to rinse your razor after EVERY full stroke to keep it from jamming up), and leaves me remarkably smooth.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoyed using this product at first.</li>
            <li>Shaving is enjoyable for the first time in my life.  </li>
            <li>Worth the money!</li>
            <li>Put it on first and then use the gel or foam on top of it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Follow the instructions and you will experience a unique shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/smack my multi-blade razor more frequently to prevent clogging, but it was a very smooth</li>
            <li>No nicks or irritation, super smooth close shave.</li>
            <li>, I CAN LOOK CLEAN 7 DAYS</li>
            <li>just dry it with a towel and your skin feels great all day.</li>
            <li>It helps the razor glide against the skin and helps to provide a clean job.</li>
            <li>But until you wash your face clean this Oiley stuff stays on your face even after you shaved.  </li>
            <li>the shave powder is just easier to apply and clean up.</li>
            <li>I like the clean smell as well.</li>
            <li>I use this when I don&#x27;t have the time to clean and exfoliate my head and face.</li>
            <li>I also use a Gillette fusion about once or twice per week to \\&quot;clean up\\&quot; the hair missed by my Braun.  </li>
            <li>If anyone has tips for keeping your razor clean using this product please let me know.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not quite as smooth as shaving creme, but good enough to travel with.</li>
            <li>Pleasant, but it is definitely not a scent that anyone would mistake for a cologne.  </li>
            <li>I find myself doubting many of those positive reviews and whether some may have a vested interest.</li>
            <li>The whiskers do not clean out of the razor very good.</li>
            <li>: you can greatly reduce the gunk by exfoliating first -- I recently started using a hard-bristled body brush before hopping in the shower and have noticed a huge change.</li>
            <li>Be sure to use plenty of water, and have super hot water to clean your razor</li>
            <li>I have an entire bathroom sink area full of shaving products as I truly enjoy the art of a good shave</li>
            <li>the 2-3 percent of reviewers out here who lowballed the product are doing, or whether they have a special sensitivity to the ingredients, but I think the overwhelming positive response here should let you know</li>
            <li>I absolutely love being able to buy a box of razors that would last me a year for what you could spend easily on a month supply of &amp;#34;modern&amp;#34; razors.  </li>
            <li>To my surprise, the razor glided right over my head!</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s right under everyone&#x27;s nose at Walmart for a whopping $4 a bottle, and people are still buying all sorts of creams or goos or pre-electric liquids!      </li>
            <li>It is inexpensive, easy to use, smells great, slightly spicy, but not overpowering.</li>
            <li>Very easy to apply and gives a fantastic result, leaving skin soft.  </li>
            <li>My skin felt soooo smooth and soft and the shave was amazingly close (the first time!).</li>
            <li>falsehood.&lt;br /&gt;Eliminates the need for soap, gels, moisturizers - for me that was a full wagon of horse manure claim as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Terrific in every respect----performance was better than expected and service by the seller was great!  </li>
            <li>I found that it is also a good value for the money overall as not a lot is required.</li>
            <li>cannot say enough good about this product.</li>
            <li>but it actually smells good yet not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>Ok, I am very picky about what I use for my shaving needs.</li>
            <li>And 3-4 drops is really all you need. :)</li>
            <li>After I shave in the direction of the hair, I massage my face again (without adding any more oil) and shave against the grain for a really close shave.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the tip Amazoners :)</li>
            <li>Use on a soft warm beard ( I shave in the shower) before applying  the shaving cream</li>
            <li>It is OK, didn&#x27;t really notice a difference.</li>
            <li>The product didn&#x27;t really seem to help with the recommended number of drops, and adding more than the recommended number of drops led to my razor clogging.  </li>
            <li>It really surprised me how effective it was.</li>
            <li>It does give a good enough shave (</li>
            <li>(6) rinse with cool water, (7) apply aftershave</li>
            <li>I tried the instructions several times and I do not get any good results with this.</li>
            <li>OK, I don&#x27;t really know about that.  </li>
            <li>kind of like old spice.</li>
            <li>But it is cool after put it on skin.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make any lather like my lovely Proraso soap did, so I can&#x27;t really see where I&#x27;ve been shaving.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make any lather like my lovely Proraso soap did, so I can&#x27;t really see where I&#x27;ve been shaving.</li>
            <li>smell is a little strong, but makes for a great shave, it&#x27;s like my face is teflon</li>
            <li>I rarely write reviews, but this is very worth of a review.</li>
            <li>After the first use, it was like a miracle come true!</li>
            <li>first tried it while I was using cartridge Mach3 razors and it always clogged the razors easily when combined with shaving creams.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty strong hint.  </li>
            <li>Be sure and clean your blade with a moist towelette before your next shave, though, OK?    </li>
            <li>Good luck getting a great shave, takes 3 times longer than normal, and I feel like I hardly shaved at all.</li>
            <li>and I used this oil and it at first worked excellent, especially for the sensitive neck area.</li>
            <li>I got an excellent shave, it&#x27;s not as messy as a can of shaving cream, plus it&#x27;s small and great for travel.</li>
            <li>Very small and handy!!!</li>
            <li>Have used every and all sensitive cream available, this is hands down the best I have used.</li>
            <li>I found that some of those areas on my neck that my new electric was finally able to get cleaned up to a reasonable degree, were no longer able to be shaved as well.  </li>
            <li>soap/creme mixture will quickly clog DE razor crevice - rinse often&lt;</li>
            <li>company that shipped did so quickly and even followed up to ensure that all had gone well.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really bother me, and the menthol does give it a kind of tingling feeling, but that doesn&#x27;t help much when I cannot use it at home.  </li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll need to give it a quick rinse.</li>
            <li>/&gt;this does have a mild oder</li>
            <li>Especially if you use a safety razor with straight razor blades (which are cheaper, and this stuff works great</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m super allergic to eucalyptus.  </li>
            <li>I was very happy to find it on the shelf of my local drugstore for the same price as Amazon, but with no shipping charges.</li>
            <li>I will not use the product to shave with, but I will more than likely keep the top off of the bottle and fragrant the room.</li>
            <li>But three drops of this stuff and seriously, extremely QUICK, painless shave everywhere, legs, wherever you wanna shave, though I don&#x27;t know how it would work on the face.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I can&#x27;t tell if it really did much</li>
            <li>Using just 5 drops and no shaving cream I can get a super close shave.</li>
            <li>I smell good - not a strong smell, but pleasant and masculine.</li>
            <li>I have eczema - it&#x27;s very gentle, &amp; far cheaper and more luxurious than any after shave moisturizer out there!)  </li>
            <li>and brush may be better but working full time and have to leave very early in the morning</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t generally use aftershave with it, since it smells nice and does the job on</li>
            <li>Overall, very glad I tried it,</li>
            <li>and it does exactly what is says, smooth shave with no razor burn, bumps, ingrown hairs or anything like that.</li>
            <li>The instructions say to rinse with very hot water.</li>
            <li>It works exactly as described and my skin feels amazingly smooth and closely shaven.</li>
            <li>My final preferences are the soft soaps that come in pots like Proraso and Omega and best of all The Real Shaving Co&#x27;s Shave Cream in a tube.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;A shave for the very first time with</li>
            <li>Just running your fingers or hand under the tap won&#x27;t do you any good unless you use soap or whatever for a long while.</li>
            <li>The stuff works, gives a cool fresh feeling after the shave.</li>
            <li>But I end up having to clean and change my blades more frequently.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied with the close shave and absence of any skin irritation.</li>
            <li>I had been doing DE razor shaving as a new hobby for two weeks and was burned every day doing every sure fire technique stated to stop it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy to travel with, it does a far better job than any other product I have tried, and the best part is that you can actually see where you&#x27;re shaving</li>
            <li>I thought this stuff gets great reviews and will take up less counter space.</li>
            <li>The shave oil is pretty good overall.</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t cost you much for product so it will be easy money.</li>
            <li>This makes shaving fast and easy.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and most products will make my face breakout.</li>
            <li>TWO of this worked great, rubbed it into dry skin and proceeded to get the closest, most comfortable dry electric shave I&#x27;ve ever had.  </li>
            <li>I was HOOKED after the first use!</li>
            <li>Highly Recommended!!!</li>
            <li>It is the only shave oil I&#x27;ve tried, but it&#x27;s better than ANY shave foam I&#x27;ve used...period!  </li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>pretty close!  </li>
            <li>It works exactly as described!</li>
            <li>I enjoy using different high end shaving lathers with a boars hair brush, and did not figure this stuff would be comparable, but actually find it to be the best I&#x27;ve used, even over some of those $30 per container</li>
            <li>is also great for travel, this little bottle will last like 2 months or more!</li>
            <li>Much to my surprise, Shave Secret was easily the best of the prep products.</li>
            <li>I would say my facial hair is of normal coarseness, and fairly dense, and I only need to use 3 drops of this stuff to get a nice close comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I was a little worried about leaving it on my face when I was done (not washing the remaining oil off with soap), because I thought it would clog my pores or something, but I just dabbed with the towel like the instructions said, and my face felt great for the rest of the day.</li>
            <li>my legs it works GREAT as a lubricant before applying just a little bit of &amp;#34;Kiss my Face&amp;#34; shave cream.</li>
            <li>the positive side, the shave is reasonably good for my soft face hair, and it feels better on the skin after you are done because of the lubricating moisture that is left on your face.</li>
            <li>Following the directions, it works amazingly well.  </li>
            <li>Three drops, mixed with water, on the area to be shaved -- amazing.  </li>
            <li>Additionally, this product works great with 2-blade disposables, which are cheap (I like Shick) and work wonders -- in my experience, they do a better job than the fancy (read: expensive)</li>
            <li>a clove smell, more so than you would detect in an Old Bay aftershave</li>
            <li>It replaces your shaving cream, and with just 6 drops coats your face with enough lubrication to effectively trim your beard.</li>
            <li>the price its worth a shot to try it if you&#x27;re on the fence</li>
            <li>It even worked well on my head, which is a lot more sensitive.</li>
            <li>It worth the price.</li>
            <li>and I think this is well worth the $4.  </li>
            <li>The Shave Secret stays in place and feels great!</li>
            <li>All in all, wherever you buy the product it is worth the money.</li>
            <li>Heard about this on The Blaze radio, and figured it was worth $4 to try it out.</li>
            <li>Superior Stainless Double Edge blades</li>
            <li>With this product, my neck rarely burns and has fewer cuts.</li>
            <li>Also, it has a nice herbal smell that is left on your face.</li>
            <li>I thought it was the perfect opportunity to test my bottle of Shave Secret with a manual razor.  </li>
            <li>, this thing is just as good or even better than the pricier British import, I see myself buying lots and lots of this thing in the future.</li>
            <li>When the oil is more clear, it doesn&#x27;t cause a problem.</li>
            <li>I shave with a Merkur 180 safety razor, Derby double edge blades, and Van Der Hagen Deluxe</li>
            <li>But I have been trying different shave oils over recent weeks and have made a discovery of a much much better shaving oil that is additionally quite good for your hair and skin.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this product produces any closer of a shavethan my favorite shaving gel - \\&quot;Nivea Shaving Gel for Sensitive Skin\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>Nice basic oil to use for shaving.</li>
            <li>Best thing for Shave Secret is its price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, for the price I fell like i got my money worth.</li>
            <li>small, convenient, and it works beautifully.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li>Does gunk the razor up a bit though, but worth it for my exczema prone skin.</li>
            <li>Actually it&#x27;s kinda nice not having all the lathery fuss and muss.</li>
            <li>product is worth trying atleast once.</li>
            <li>well worth the cost in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s natural too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not crazy about the clove and menthol scent</li>
            <li>also laugh in the bumpy stubbly faces of all the foam users.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth buying often</li>
            <li>Shave Secret combined with Proraso made for the best shave ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am a woman struggling with PCOS, and shaving is literally the only thing that gets rid of the hair effectively.</li>
            <li>I can do multiple passes with this, without getting any kind of irritation.</li>
            <li>Overall a nice product.</li>
            <li>Just used a couple quick swipes with my straight razor and the hair slid clean off.</li>
            <li>I purchased this knowing that it violated the tradition and rituals of a good wet shave</li>
            <li>The feeling of this product was more aqueous that it was unctuous; being oil I guess i expected a bit more slipperiness.</li>
            <li>Smile.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been so pleased with the shave, moisturizing and natural fragrance of this product</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very impressed by Shave Secret.  </li>
            <li>But it is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>The first time I used this product I winced at the thought of shaving without foam, but soon realized that it stands true to its promises.</li>
            <li>The same size bottle is available for $4 at most Wal-Mart&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>It leaves the skin feeling soft and healthy.  </li>
            <li>The thickness of Anthony Logistics and Art of Shaving causes me to break out, whereas as Shave Secret is a perfect consistency.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>For the last couple of years I&#x27;ve been fooling around with razors, blades, and shaving creams trying to get a closer, more comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>I read the reviews and thought it would be worth giving this a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But what surprised me the most was that I had achieved this despite shaving on a day</li>
            <li>Then a persistent TV commercial for the MicroTouch One Classic Safety Razor with 24 FREE blades caught my attention by promising &amp;#34;The Best Shave of Your Life!&amp;#34; That sent me off to search Amazon, my recent source for everything.</li>
            <li>I put the whole works in a drawer when Harry came along in an e-mail offering a beautifully designed $15 dollar razor and German-made four-blade refill cartridge that cost wa-a-a-y-y less than Schick, Gillette, or Wilkinson Sword Competitors.</li>
            <li>It has really help reduce skin irritation quite significantly.</li>
            <li>Rinse and tap, (hot water, stronger taps) not that difficult, fair trade for the good</li>
            <li>Used with a nice, soft badger brush I thought that combination was pretty much just peachy.</li>
            <li>This is very much like a French shaving oil I used years ago, a nice clove smell.</li>
            <li>But then, when I splashed a little water on top and got out the razor, I was amazed by how easy, painless, and smooth the shave was.</li>
            <li>either i&#x27;m not using it right</li>
            <li>I pair this with a Blade Buddy and all is right with my shave.</li>
            <li>, that is, IF I could find the right razor and product.  </li>
            <li>Dudes, and dudets, this right here...</li>
            <li>this stuff right here........</li>
            <li>You can feel the menthol, which is just right.  </li>
            <li>I always use it when traveling as it&#x27;s lightweight and just right, no need to bring shaving cream or aftershave.</li>
            <li>and he was right.  </li>
            <li>I take the time to do it right.</li>
            <li>Just soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth trying for the price!!</li>
            <li>+ people to leave positive reviews on just about any web site, for a cut of the profit!</li>
            <li>But I will continue using my straight because I enjoy the ritual of using hot lather, etc.  </li>
            <li>Mainly if you can shave solely by feel and not by sight (because you can&#x27;t see where you have already shaved) and you don&#x27;t mind the menthol smell, this is a product that will give some of the smoothest feeling face and head shaves available.</li>
            <li>I have used this product over the past couple of years, and it is by far the best solution for getting a closer electric shave while minimizing irritation.</li>
            <li>The shave   was not bad; as I said it&#x27;s better than regular foam.</li>
            <li>It was at best a wet, but dry shave.  </li>
            <li>Works pretty well, but it gunks up your razor pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>I was concerned that my skin might be too oily afterwards, but after a rinse and a towel-dry it actually  felt soft and pleasant.  </li>
            <li>This product makes the whole shaving process insanely easy with zero irritation and is very compact which makes it convenient to travel with.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Results: with the hard soap bars it does help lubricate the skin better and give a more comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li>This product is great if you have an old single blade razor.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small size makes it is great for anyone travelling on an airplane.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first time was a sample I got in a Fun Run pack.  </li>
            <li>Once you menally get past it, it is great stuff.</li>
            <li>Shaving is easier with the lubrication, and it does work with the water on the face to spread remarkably well with just a few drops.  </li>
            <li>By far, after only using it only once, I encountered the best shave I ever had.</li>
            <li>last thing: if you use modern shave creams, use them *lightly* !!</li>
            <li>Not of good quality and not worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;Kevin T Maloney</li>
            <li>This little tiny bottle of stuff works awesome!!!!  </li>
            <li>I visited the \\&quot;Art of Shaving\\&quot; and got new insights into how to shave and what makes a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>This oil makes it a lot more forgivig toward those mistakes.&lt;br /&gt;After I was done not a single cut or knick.</li>
            <li>Shave Secret help me get an excellent shave under my neck area which I could not get very well with shave gels with making it irritated.</li>
            <li>For only a few dollars you get an awesome shave with just water.  </li>
            <li>When I am totally finished the shave, I massage 3 to 4 drops of the oil into my freshly shaven head and face for a healthy shiny glow.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have to carry bulky shaving cream bottles but ended up loving the it so much that I now use this daily for shaving.</li>
            <li>For regular home use, I will stick to the men&#x27;s shave soap and brush, which is much more economical than both this oil and all the shaving gels and creams out there.</li>
            <li>my husband loves this stuff, it is pretty amazing how long a bottle lasts him (couple months..)</li>
            <li>A good multi blade razor with vibration and some Jack Black or Art of shaving shave</li>
            <li>Other shave oils require more, which is fine; I don&#x27;t care if I need to use 3 drops or 10.  </li>
            <li>The combination of this oil with Gillete Fusion Proglide ( 5 blade razor) is giving  very good result for tough beard.</li>
            <li>No, but it is very, very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Four drops on a wet face give a real smooth effortless shave.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used this product, I was amazed.</li>
            <li>Only thing I don&#x27;t like, it causes my razors to clump up with hair, and I go through more razors.</li>
            <li>Plus my skin feels so soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Pretty versatile!&lt;br</li>
            <li>As others have mentioned, oil and hair can get clogged between multiple blades, so be sure to use an open-back design, which lets water flow between the blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ve eliminated razor bumps and minor cuts that I experienced with regular shaving cream.</li>
            <li>In fact, it&#x27;s cheaper, smells better, no greasiness in tub, and larger bottle.</li>
            <li>and although I followed it EXACTLY to how the instructions stated</li>
            <li>Thanks!  </li>
            <li>Does not lather, so you can see exactly what you are shaving.</li>
            <li>wash my face with hot water</li>
            <li>The oil seems to just keep spreading as I rub it in although it does not seem to at first.  </li>
            <li>Only four stars, though, because there are cheaper and better alternatives out there.</li>
            <li>I just went back to Wal-Mart and bought two more.</li>
            <li>I first saw it at work, a coworker had a sample and gave it to me.</li>
            <li>Works exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin, but this stuff makes shaving so smooth that I use it in place of shaving cream.</li>
            <li>After the first shave i was a convert.</li>
            <li>One application and rewetting was enough to get the most pain-free, irritation-free, cut-free, closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its okay and shaving with oil is definitely the way to go.  </li>
            <li>I usually shave my head 2 to 3 times at one shaving and one of the advantages to this product is that you don&#x27;t need to put more oil on the scalp or face area, you just add more water.</li>
            <li>And it doesn&#x27;t take much of the oil to shave!  </li>
            <li>I have since used an entire bottle and purchased two more, so I don&#x27;t run out.  </li>
            <li>I was interested in a   comparison.    </li>
            <li>I then added a 3rd drop for safe measure, and boom.</li>
            <li>one objection is the shipping cost, way too much!</li>
            <li>but I still wanted to do it the directed way first.</li>
            <li>so my head was already warm and wet.</li>
            <li>This oil along with my &amp;#34;Art of Shaving&amp;#34; non-scented shaving soap (I use a brush) gives me the closest shaving consistently.  </li>
            <li>This shave oil is getting a bit expensive but it is one of the best around.</li>
            <li>I first tested this product out in a trial size my wife got after running a 1/2 marathon.</li>
            <li>was quite surprised how smooth skin felt during shave.</li>
            <li>First, I shave in the shower.</li>
            <li>Works very well with the Blade Buddy and worth the investment.  </li>
            <li>If there&#x27;s still a lot of resistance, then you need to latter it with more water, and not oil.</li>
            <li>Not only is there no skin irritation, my skin feels better than ever.  </li>
            <li>Works just as advertised and leaves my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>From the descriptions I&#x27;ve read, I was expecting my razor to skim across my face like a hot iron on ice.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different shave oils:</li>
            <li>But after having tried so many others, I came back to this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this is the only shave goo that makes me want to shave more often.  </li>
            <li>I actually got a better shave from the Proraso pre-shave cream.  </li>
            <li>&#x27;s first though...</li>
            <li>I still prep with hot water and a towel.</li>
            <li>Love this product, I use it exclusively for my third pass</li>
            <li>I have not used shaving creme since I first tried this.  </li>
            <li>My first experience with a shaving oil - I WILL NEVER USE SHAVING CREAM OR GEL</li>
            <li>in all, I am pleased with it, and will likely buy it again.</li>
            <li>thanks!</li>
            <li>This stuff really works!  </li>
            <li>But, so far I am very pleased with this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Well, I finally tested this shaving oil with a used-once Gillette blade.  </li>
            <li>My face definitely feels much more moist with this over</li>
            <li>And try this alternative first.  </li>
            <li>More just isn&#x27;t necessary and it will clog a multi-blade razor.</li>
            <li>I first found this stuff in a goodie bag from a marathon.  </li>
            <li>They say it seems to help the razor rinse off better and last longer too.</li>
            <li>Used this product for the first time this morning.</li>
            <li>I find I actually examine my shave more closely instead of just shaving off shaving cream.  </li>
            <li>(I first saw it at an MCX on base)&lt;br</li>
            <li>advise to trim hair first if it&#x27;s over a quarter inch</li>
            <li>First, I have to use about three times the recommended amount of three drops.</li>
            <li>This oil works exactly as they say.  </li>
            <li>love this stuff, and it is the only product I use for shaving anymore.</li>
            <li>I have been shaving for many years, and in fact I&#x27;ve prepped patients for surgery for a total of 10 years, and I have never found a product as misleading as this has been.  </li>
            <li>, I tried it yesterday for the first time</li>
            <li>this is the first stuff in 25 years of shaving that lets me get away without blood or bumps.</li>
            <li>Not gonna lie, I was nervous about trying this the first time I bought it.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re ready to slice off some whiskers!    </li>
            <li>/&gt;In preparation, I wet my palms with some warm water and shook-off the excess, applied 3 drops (the recommended amount) and worked my palms together.  </li>
            <li>With the first pass of the blade I could feel the pull of every hair as the razor passed across my cheek...</li>
            <li>I applied two more drops and went in for a third attempt.</li>
            <li>can only assume that this product was designed to lubricate the hair follicle with oil so they pull from your face easier with each pass of the razor because it surely didn&#x27;t provide any glide to the blade as it passed on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>OK, I would not have been a believer but was given a sample in my goody bag after a recent 10K run.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you keep adding water back to your face or area, and you are washing out the razor under a Hot Tap.</li>
            <li>3 drops on my face after a hot water splash.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works!</li>
            <li>burn a bit at first.</li>
            <li>Has made my top ten list.</li>
            <li>Oh and after your done shaving your legs you don&#x27;t even have to moisturize, it makes your skin look and feel soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Had my first shave with this stuff.</li>
            <li>I was amazed when I first shaved with two days growth.  </li>
            <li>With the better soaps listed above it made no difference at all.  </li>
            <li>At first I was kind of skeptical but after using it for roughly 3 months I can say it&#x27;s the best shaving oil I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>Will definitely order more.</li>
            <li>That is the best shave Secret!</li>
            <li>It reminds me of dime-store old man cheap cologne.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant at first</li>
            <li>Now I tried this on many occasions with the same success, and I have to say I really, really tried to give this product the benefit of the doubt.  </li>
            <li>Since I have more growth than a daily shaver I use 5-6 drops per use.</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t feel like much at first</li>
            <li>I first must mention that I follow the manufacturer&#x27;s instructions, but use it as a pre-shave oil, not a shaving oil.</li>
            <li>I ended up not with the MicroTouch magic product but with a Japanese twist-to-open Feather Razor and 100 Astra Platinum blades made in St. Petersburg, Russia.</li>
            <li>I first bought it at Walmart</li>
            <li>I use a double sided safety razor with Asrta Platinum blades (my favorite).  </li>
            <li>I tried it for a whole week, and it gave me razor burn twice!</li>
            <li>A few drops in the hand and you&#x27;re good.  </li>
            <li>I wish the product was a little more &amp;#34;Milky&amp;#34; in color so it would be easy to see where you already shaved.  </li>
            <li>in given how little this stuff costs, and how little you actually need to use, I think its a great value for a great price.</li>
            <li>Skin feels great after a shave, especially in the winter as the product helps with dry</li>
            <li>This happens with normal shaving cream as well but normal cream rinses easily off in the stream of water as you shave.  </li>
            <li>I have fair skin that is sensitive and varies from dry to oily.</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t mean I&#x27;ll stop using shaving foam, because there are some great foam products out there also.  </li>
            <li>Incredibly it works even better than advertised, Works Fantastic with my Electric Razor, I initially wet my face with water 3 times, put 2 drops of secret shave in my palms and rub them and then rub it on my shaving area wet my face 2 more times and then shave.</li>
            <li>All the other reviewers here are dead-on: this is an amazing product that really works!  </li>
            <li>, i used a just a little more than the recommended 3-5 drops for the first time but after that everything was smooth.</li>
            <li>If you have delicate skin in your chin and cheeks, go for it it will help you a lot, I&#x27;ve tried many products and this works perfectly ,dont shave daily, alternate one</li>
            <li>It makes for a very close, nice smooth shave with VERY little irritation.</li>
            <li>It is true that my razor gets clogged, but it&#x27;s no big deal to keep it clean by swooshing it in my basin with water.    </li>
            <li>I have a very strong neck beard area, and normal shaving cream left it irritated and still hairy.</li>
            <li>This oil is especially useful for DE safety razor users who are traveling, as it eliminates the need to pack shave soap, shaving cream, badger brush, shave mug, and other safety razor accessories.</li>
            <li>This tiny bottle will last me a very long time, great product!</li>
            <li>Your face feels tingling fresh and vibrantly clearer.</li>
            <li>, I use a fusion and hydro 5, both clog up to the point I used an old toothbrush to clean them out.  </li>
            <li>Then wipe your legs clean with a soft, sturdy paper towel.</li>
            <li>2nd off, it really does give you a better shave.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this because it seemed like it would be a really convenient way to have a quick and decent shave with my safety razor.  </li>
            <li>*was* a really convenient way to have a quick and decent shave with my safety razor.  </li>
            <li>This is much like a product that you can find overseas, mostly in the middle east.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ve probably already spent more time reading reviews for this product than is worth your time.</li>
            <li>I use a double edge safety razor, and have a pretty strong beard.  </li>
            <li>Figuring it was just a gimmick, I looked at the positive reviews on Amazon and decided to give it a try...    </li>
            <li>And, the result was still positive.  </li>
            <li>Quite frankly I don&#x27;t understand the positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>: you only need a few drops (literally) of this stuff for an amazing shave: just make sure to massage your face thoroughly before.</li>
            <li>But I tried it this morning for the first time and it really does work just as described.  </li>
            <li>The shaving oil doesn&#x27;t really lubricate that well - in fact, it&#x27;s pretty gummy and drags a bit and clogs your safety razor.</li>
            <li>I pretty much gave up on razor shaves years ago.  </li>
            <li>Having shaved with foam most of my life, it was strange not to load on foam at the start of the shave.  </li>
            <li>It lasts a long time, even though I use more than three drops.  </li>
            <li>First off, I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>I wet my face first with warm water, apply the oil and shave normally.</li>
            <li>is no better than soapy water, maybe not as good.</li>
            <li>oil has a bit of an odor, not bad sort of like an old time barber shop.  </li>
            <li>On a good note, the bottle was small</li>
            <li>works surprisingly well and in small amounts ..</li>
            <li>So I rinse in very hot running water after every swipe down my face, and that works most of the time.</li>
            <li>Use the oil as the instructions say, rinse the blade often with hot water and keep the skin wet, the skin is moist not dry as with any soap or creme, I can just rinse and good to go.</li>
            <li>This product is easy to use, works extremely well, provides an exceptionally close and comfortable shave and is very convenient to take on a trip because it is so small.  </li>
            <li>I bought this purely on the strength of all the positive reviews posted here.</li>
            <li>I bought it based on the large number of positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>After shaving with high quality electric razors for more years than I care to admit, I decided to switch to a double edge safety razor like my Dad used to use.  </li>
            <li>in the new world where carrying liquids through airport security is so much fun.  </li>
            <li>This stuff has given me the most smooth shave I&#x27;ve had in years, I mean completely irritation free.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty much replaced all the fancy shave soaps/badger brush nonsense with a much simpler solution.</li>
            <li>Aside from the cost adding up pretty fast, it does its job very well.</li>
            <li>A problem with this is that it can be easily misused, you need to rub the oil on your face, and latter your face with water also.</li>
            <li>I had my super sensitive skin husband try it.</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin and</li>
            <li>It does gunk up the razor a bit, but it washes out easy enough.</li>
            <li>was on the sideburn part of my face, which is easy to pluck with tweezers, and none on the part of the face where the cheek/jawbone go from vertical to horizontal towards the neck which was always the big problem area.  </li>
            <li>- This was easy enough to do.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li>I think it smells pretty good, and goes on quick, and the person using it only needs a few drops per time shaving.</li>
            <li>now you&#x27;re left with a not-even-half shaven face smelling like strong chemical pine cones and you think &amp;</li>
            <li>use this with my electric wet/dry razor from Panasonic for pure shaving heaven.</li>
            <li>I use just 6 drops, and have a rather large face.</li>
            <li>but it certainly helps and smells nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It contained certain oils that made it do so.</li>
            <li>I will certainly buy it again.</li>
            <li>was interested in the idea that I don&#x27;t have to use messy shaving cream, and the easy clean up afterwards.</li>
            <li>Very impressed and sorry it took me so long to see the light.</li>
            <li>It was as if the hair was being pulled out of my face, and I was using a new razor right out of the package.  </li>
            <li>It works fine, but I will stick to a quality gel in the future.  </li>
            <li>This is an amazing little product.</li>
            <li>WOW - the stuff really works!!  </li>
            <li>I have a generally tough beard and could probably win a beard growing contest.  </li>
            <li>I first saw this product at Walmart, then saw the reviews on this site giving it high marks.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it makes such a huge difference when shaving</li>
            <li>Shave Secret works fantastic with safety razors, and works so amazingly well</li>
            <li>A friend suggested a popular, but more expensive pre-shave oil that is about $22-$25 per bottle.</li>
            <li>, if you do not like the smell of cloves this is a real put off.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I switch between an electric razor and multi blade razor (like a mach 3)depending on how much time I have to shave or my mood.  </li>
            <li>I can really feel the difference while shaving.</li>
            <li>I can see much difference, but rubbing my hand across my face yields a closeness I have not recalled since using a safety razor.  </li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t really what I was looking for.    </li>
            <li>This stuff really works.  </li>
            <li>, it really is a \\&quot;Shave</li>
            <li>My shave was close, smooth and left my skin feeling silky.</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t think he&#x27;d really like it,</li>
            <li>I bought this from Wal-Mart (much cheaper there)</li>
            <li>My skin is much happier now than when I was using shave soap and a brush.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Really great.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Using shaving cremes with a brush resulted in much closer shaves.  </li>
            <li>I use five drops a day on my wet face and then put Kiehl&#x27;s shave cream on top.  </li>
            <li>This product works really well.  </li>
            <li>The shave us so smooth and you only need 3 drops.</li>
            <li>Shave Secret works great.</li>
            <li>Shaving works really well.  </li>
            <li>Really works as advertised.  </li>
            <li>The oil really helps the balde glide over your face and cut the whiskers rather than dragging and hacking.  </li>
            <li>It has made shaving much easier and quicker.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>I really wanted this to work.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really have any issues with bumps</li>
            <li>This stuff really works.</li>
            <li>HOLY HIGH HEAVEN!  </li>
            <li>No bumbs, no irritation, and a very close shave.  </li>
            <li>For the past year I&#x27;ve been using a Braun Series 7 electric razor which has actually been pretty great except for the fact that it doesnt provide the closest shave.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the oil for about 3 weeks and really like it.  </li>
            <li>so much-</li>
            <li>the hair and oil would really gunk up a multi-bladed cartridge.  </li>
            <li>Shave Secret greatly reduces razor burn.  </li>
            <li>When you rub your hands over your scalp after shaving, it feels so extra smooth with no imperfections.</li>
            <li>Shave Secret is great.</li>
            <li>I have to use more than recommended drops and still get drag.</li>
            <li>I really like this shave oil.</li>
            <li>Proraso gives a much smoother shave with no oily or gummy feeling.  </li>
            <li>Very oily</li>
            <li>You may be able to get a &#x27;barbershop&#x27; wet shave line up from the comfort of your bathroom sink with no cream etc.</li>
            <li>been using it for years, really smoothes out shaving</li>
            <li>So when the directions said to use three drops I was very hesitant</li>
            <li>I really was thinking I wanted a pre shave oil to apply before my choice cream, but also</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really have any critique for it.</li>
            <li>OTW, the modern shave creams are the way to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li>This may work for &amp;#34;sink shavers&amp;#34; but not so much for me.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think people with a lot of hair will like it because you really have to massage your face with it.</li>
            <li>There is no secret to it</li>
            <li>With shave secret it leaves the skin feeling great.</li>
            <li>In fact, I can&#x27;t discern much difference between using it and not using it.</li>
            <li>works very well .</li>
            <li>Gently rub them together</li>
            <li>Thanks to those of you who did list this info for those of us who need it.  </li>
            <li>Got this for my FIL as he is really into shaving.  </li>
            <li>This product seems targeted at people using a straight or double-edged razor.</li>
            <li>I use this oil to edge up with a straight edge razor.</li>
            <li>So it works very well as a shave oil and after shave.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I admit that I&#x27;ve tried to use it with a straight razor, but I don&#x27;t think it was meant to be used with a straight.  </li>
            <li>Then in the same place against the hair growth for a completely smooth shave.</li>
            <li>Eh, its alright, too much work to keep reapplying.</li>
            <li>Shaving oil is a fast and convenient shaving aid.</li>
            <li>You still don&#x27;t use much, but going off the instructions didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.  </li>
            <li>It was cheap enough, if it doesn&#x27;t work!  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel or seem like much</li>
            <li>It really does get you a close shave.</li>
            <li>and i am 50 but shave secret works great.</li>
            <li>The stuff really is legit.</li>
            <li>You need to gently tap the razor on the sink under flowing water.  </li>
            <li>What I don&#x27;t like about the oil is that it clogs the blades...doesn&#x27;t rinse out very well.  </li>
            <li>It adds a much needed warming feel to the oil.</li>
            <li>The plastic squeeze bottle makes dispensing the oil very easy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>VERY WELL..</li>
            <li>It really doesn&#x27;t work like the advertising claims.</li>
            <li>Shaves well, but has too much menthol for me.</li>
            <li>I even tried to apply 20 drops instead of 8 for shaving my head and it did not do much.</li>
            <li>Instead, my skin got very irritated from shaving.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t even try to use it as a pre-shave oil and put real lather over it.</li>
            <li>If I skip a day or 2, then it clogs up the razor too much</li>
            <li>the whole \\&quot;post-apocalypse\\&quot; setting?</li>
            <li>Fast Forward</li>
            <li>This product is no secret.</li>
            <li>NOT A SECRET ANYMORE . . . . .</li>
            <li>I much prefer these types of shaving oils to foamy lathers.</li>
            <li>The shave was much closer</li>
            <li>(Shave Secret is also a great moisturizer</li>
            <li>Really like it for blade shaving in the shower.  </li>
            <li>This is highly unusual for me.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really tell if it helps or not?</li>
            <li>It makes the areas I shave so much smoother and keeps me from getting razor burns and bumps.</li>
            <li>When I started straight razor shaving I tried every shave cream/soap/gel</li>
            <li>Using this oil will clog up a modern 3-5 blade razor within 4 strokes.</li>
            <li>Product as described; fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried a straight razor but it intrigues me.</li>
            <li>Get real.</li>
            <li>I use this with a Panasonic Arc3 class shaver (LT71), and it has really improved my shaving experience.</li>
            <li>The Panasonic would pinch once in a while prior to my using this, but now it&#x27;s just smooth.</li>
            <li>Neither one really worked that well.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t really tell any difference between the two.</li>
            <li>You are now ready to shave.  </li>
            <li>I really, really wanted this to work...</li>
            <li>It is a very compact size, so</li>
            <li>You absolutely won&#x27;t regret the savings or the closeness of the shave with this product.  </li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ve always used shaving gels, creams, whatever, and they don&#x27;t work very well because I still end up with cuts and nicks and razor burn.</li>
            <li>This &#x27;snake oi&#x27;l is the real deal.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really like the smell BTW.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s in this stuff, and I probably don&#x27;t want to know, but it works very well.  </li>
            <li>An absolutely identical clone is made under the brand name Wilkinson Sword.</li>
            <li>But the feeling bothers me, so since it doesn&#x27;t seem to do much for me and bothers me a bit, I&#x27;m voting no on this one.</li>
            <li>I really like the shave I get with it.</li>
            <li>I had heard that pre-shave oil helps smooth things out, but I didn&#x27;t want to spend $25 on a tiny vial of designer stuff, so I tried olive oil before my shaving cream.</li>
            <li>I got the best results when I used a quality double edge razor (vintage gillette or mekur) and followed up the shave secret application with proraso sensistive shaving soap.  </li>
            <li>, smooth shaves against the grain that I could never do with a cream or gel, keeps my face soft with the natural oils.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell of the product is subtle and pleasant.</li>
            <li>My one complaint would be that the oil causes all of the hairs to accumulate and stick to the edge of your blade more than with shaving cream, thus requiring more frequent cleaning of the blade during shaving.</li>
            <li>But at least it can make you look good when you&#x27;re killing zombies.    </li>
            <li>I used it as a pre-shave oil, and would let it sit in warm water on my face for a few minutes.</li>
            <li>WOW!!!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a really dense beard, but being born with curly hair my whiskers are stiff, grow in all directions, and often don&#x27;t stand up like nice guys</li>
            <li>, maybe I have a big face - so it can go pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>I was surprised that it helped the razor glide right off the bat.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small size makes it great for travelers too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to thoroughly wet your face and hands with warm water before applying Shave Secret.</li>
            <li>On the other hand, I get satisfactory results with just water, although the oil is better for a really close shave.  </li>
            <li>Gives me a clean, close, and comfortable shave everyday.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical, at first, but soon joined the ranks of the many reviewers who love this product.  </li>
            <li>I was extremely reluctant and became extremely pleased.  </li>
            <li>But just 3 drop of this stuff works better than any amount of any other shave oil, cream or gel that I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mind</li>
            <li>this amount (3 drops per shave) will outlast most of my other attempts at shaving foams/creams.</li>
            <li>I threw my other Walmart razors and foam in the garbage &#x3D;).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always looking for a better shaving cream, gel, razor and other miracle product.  </li>
            <li>, I assumed that it was just any essential oil that would do the trick, so I tried this other sample of essential oils that is supposed to help you focus or something to shave, and it wasn&#x27;t nearly as good!</li>
            <li>follwoing evaluation compares [[ASIN:B004ZBS4U8 Somersets Original English]], [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Better than any other product I have tried.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still a bigger fan of the aforementioned creams and soaps however, as I can more easily tell where I went over my face to reduce potential razor burn.</li>
            <li>But, I smartly purchased &amp;#34;Schick ST Disposable Razors with Aloe for Women, 12 Count Package&amp;#34; (only $6.88 as an Add-On Item), and was happy to find that they have this little tab you can push that helps clear the gunk away.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten better but the first few times I missed spots.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using shaving oils instead of cream for a long time, and this one is by far my favorite</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a small price to pay for such a great product.</li>
            <li>but if I was down to only 2 products to buy for shaving would be this oil and a good razor.</li>
            <li>Truth be told, my tallow shave soaps (such as Tabac) do a far superior job without Shave Secret and are much better than using this oil alone...</li>
            <li>I was thinking that the razor blades that came with my new kit were cheap and I have been butchering my face for the last 4 days.  </li>
            <li>With this you don&#x27;t need a big can of shaving cream, you don&#x27;t need badger brushes or special lotions.</li>
            <li>You never need to add more oil, but you may need a little water or to wet the razor more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll use the oil for as long as its available.</li>
            <li>I know that might sound strange</li>
            <li>Only downside (which I find to be the razors fault) is that the \\&quot;magic gel strip\\&quot; that is next to the blades wares out extremely fast by not using shave gel/cream -</li>
            <li>I have pretty sensitive skin and let me tell you..</li>
            <li>As I travel frequently, the ShaveSecret will be very convenient!</li>
            <li>It does contain a small amount of menthol which I rather liked.</li>
            <li>Takes a bit of getting used to - goes on as an oil, of course, and tends to clog the razor (you need to rinse frequently with hot water).  </li>
            <li>I usually shave in shower and it was a nice change to not having to shower to get a shave.</li>
            <li>post-shave face feels amazing, not dried out and tight.</li>
            <li>To put this in perspective, If I went more than 2 days without using my electric razor I would then have to use my hair clippers to shave it down</li>
            <li>Nothing more to say other than, BUY IT!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another large problem I have with Shave Secret is that I could not use the oil by itself and get a good shave out of it.</li>
            <li>I am a straight razor shaver and am always trying out new soaps and oils which will enhance the comfort of my shave.</li>
            <li>I can usually go many shaves without replacing razor, but once I used this product less than 5 times I had to toss my razor.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My Shave Gel works better and gives a cleaner shave with less iritation.</li>
            <li>and I find it is almost impossible to get a great shave without this oil!</li>
            <li>provide a decent shave&lt;br /&gt;Its</li>
            <li>The instructions said to use 3 to 5 drops, but I found that was enough to cover your upper lip at the most.</li>
            <li>rub my palm where ever I am going to shave mainly &amp;#34;counter&amp;#34; hair.&lt;br /&gt;Shave and rinse the blade</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been rocking a partial beard MOST of my freakin&#x27; adult life(by</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t buy or use this, unless you have a particular use or you&#x27;re Persian.  </li>
            <li>I have been using shave secret for a week, and so far I&#x27;m not all that happy with the results.</li>
            <li>It provides a smooth, close shave even for sensitive skin after multiple days of shaving in a row.</li>
            <li>and I get the clearest shave I have ever had, not to mention that it smells decent as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Try shaving with just 3 drops, and only add more the next time if feel it&#x27;s needed.  </li>
            <li>this runs out, I&#x27;ll try a similar product like American Crew, that (hopefully) has a better smell.  </li>
            <li>If you use the better soaps to begin with you have similar cost and a simpler experience with similar results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have tried to use the product multiple times, and it just seems barely adequate at best.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it smells decent.</li>
            <li>As a collector of shaving razors and avid wet shaver I am always excited to try new products.</li>
            <li>I just know I had no razor skip, got a really close shave, and my skin was very soft after.</li>
            <li>the dry shave stick a little better as this seems to not run as smooth over the face.</li>
            <li>I even tried high dollar electric razors, nope, they will not work for me.    </li>
            <li>I will say though that the price on Amazon is quite high when you factor in the shipping.  </li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Having learned of the comfort of shaving with oil, I looked around and found coconut oil highly recommended.  </li>
            <li>I Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>For those that haven&#x27;t used an oil shaver before, I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>so I had high expectations.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend you try in.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what oils are used in the product, but I suspect that one of the oils may be mineral oil, which is highly viscous and becomes tacky when applied to my skin.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>High quality product.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend trying this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li>I use a Panasonic wet/dry shaver and have wet shaved with fine creams.</li>
            <li>An old toothbrush solves that problem rather quickly, and it isn&#x27;t enough to be that much of a hassle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My razor glides more easily than it does with regular shaving cream, and I get a shave that is at least as close</li>
            <li>well if you shave every single day and your facial hair is very fine</li>
            <li>In using this stuff with both types of razors, I got a better shave, and I think (but can&#x27;t objectivily prove) that my non-electric razor, lasted a little longer than usual.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it does take a little getting use to not being able to see where you shaved.</li>
            <li>Yes, your cartridge razor will need a little more cleaning out.</li>
            <li>I think it may shave a little better than shaving cream.</li>
            <li>A little bit better.</li>
            <li>However, all that being said, I think this would probably be ok for shaving your face since the skin is a little tougher.  </li>
            <li>A simple solution - an old toothbrush to clean blades.</li>
            <li>I just have to be a little more careful that I don&#x27;t miss any parts of my now amazingly smooth visage.</li>
            <li>I just have to be a little more careful that I don&#x27;t miss any parts of my now amazingly smooth visage.</li>
            <li>I think other guys on here are traditionalists and use safety razors and less modern blades; however I have been very pleased with the modern razor and SS.      </li>
            <li>Works great but smells weird.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really have really sensitive skin and ussualy use a shave gel.</li>
            <li>I brought this product on a business trip and tested it on a four day old beard (I&#x27;m a yeti my hair grows so fast).</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive and very prone to irritation and razor burn.  </li>
            <li>WOW does it ever get you close with no irritation and fast too.  </li>
            <li>, very compact bottle for travel in a toiletries bag and the container is clear, so that you can tell when it&#x27;s almost gone, something that you can&#x27;t do w/ a metal can.</li>
            <li>As I pointed out, it became tacky on my skin, which caused razor drag and also meant that I wasn&#x27;t getting a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>Too oily, it may seem to work because your skin naturally gets use to shaving and the bumps will no longer appear so this is really doing nothing.</li>
            <li>I use a double edge Merkur razor with Feather Stainless blades and Shave Secret does what it promises and it smells great, too.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what some people are doing wrong, but this works really great for me.</li>
            <li>I think you will be surprised how much difference three drops of oil can</li>
            <li>Any oil works better than this...don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li>I just ordered 2 more firmly brother in law.</li>
            <li>As a bonus, I seem to be able to use the razor long after the lubricant strip turns white.</li>
            <li>This products needs getting used to on two fronts if you normally have used shaving cream with a brush.</li>
            <li>still prefer my soap, brush, and mug for everyday use, but when I am even more pressed for time - or when I am on the road, this is now my GO-TO shaving substance.</li>
            <li>Then you just shave as you normally would.</li>
            <li>GUYS, if you&#x27;re corporate, or would just like to truly have that &#x27;fresh shaven&#x27; look 7 days a week, THIS IS IT.</li>
            <li>Been using the same bottle near daily for 6+ months, about to order more.  </li>
            <li>After a few weeks I noticed more acne than normal.</li>
            <li>After hearing several Shave Secret commercials on some of my favorite talk radio shows, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try - especially since it is SO much more economical than higher-priced shave oil.  </li>
            <li>Use Coconut oil instead, under normal shaving</li>
            <li>Your face will feel so much better not having been dried out</li>
            <li>but it does DEFINITELY have a distinct odor.</li>
            <li>But it always left my skin feeling really hot and sometimes really itchy.</li>
            <li>Be sure to spread it evenly and thoroughly to avoid missing a spot.</li>
            <li>Shave Secret surprisingly, works just as well as shaving cremes.</li>
            <li>Shave Secret is unbelievably good.</li>
            <li>Shave Secret turned out to be a good introduction to shaving with oil vs. foam or soap.  </li>
            <li>I got a good shave with the Shave Secret oil, but they claim it has a &amp;#34;hint of menthol&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>but I recommend a good tallow shave soap over Shave Secret.</li>
            <li>I have always suffered through ingrowns and shaving burns until Shave Secret combined with the Edwin Jagger DE89Lbl razor and Astra Superior Premium blades.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shave Secret is a good shaving oil, but I prefer King of Shaves to it.  </li>
            <li>Just to let the general public know, this product really works!!!</li>
            <li>since you really DO just use 3-4 drops, this thing&#x27;ll last a long time and is easy to carry with you on trips&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE:  </li>
            <li>Enough said, right.</li>
            <li>But I really don&#x27;t understand the overall positive reviews of the product.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Not only should everyone question this product and how over priced it is, but they should question all the so called positive reviews!</li>
            <li>perform a pre-shave (I use a double edge razor) ritual of hot moist towel to the face to get the skin and whiskers ready, for this product I did not then apply more water to my face just prior to using a brush and shave soap lather - with a damp face and wet hands</li>
            <li>ONLY use clippers and trimmers, and a screen shaver to clean up facial hair at the very end.</li>
            <li>You can shave sideburns straight as they are not hidden by shave cream.</li>
            <li>I travel internationally pretty regularly, so I am always looking for something simple, small, and good while on the road.</li>
            <li>The only thing that you may find irritating is that you so have to swish the razor in water more often while using this, fantastic for my legs but not so much for my razor.</li>
            <li>I used the oil on my final razor pass, without soap, and the oil caused more resistance than if I had dry shaved!</li>
            <li>so I can easily mow them down.</li>
            <li>I tried all types of the shaving cream and soap available in the market of USA and other country.</li>
            <li>Was hoping it would live up to the hype.  </li>
            <li>I am new to straigth shaving.</li>
            <li>It seems to live up well to its claims</li>
            <li>I used this product once and had to throw my brand new razor away because it had been all \\&quot;gunked\\&quot; up by the product</li>
            <li>(Yes, I used a new razor and rinsed it</li>
            <li>At any rate, I decided to try this new product as an addition to dermatologist recommended cleansers and treatments.  </li>
            <li>So I thought I would try something new.  </li>
            <li>and I think this might be my new shaving solution.</li>
            <li>No razor burn, no irritation, and all with a brand new shaving setup.</li>
            <li>I used three drops into the palm, rubbed the together per instructions and then to my face,  Could not get full face coverage with just that few drops is the first</li>
            <li>Same results, only twice again as smooth with NO irritation at all.   </li>
            <li>A nice bonus is I really like the smell of cloves that it leaves behind.</li>
            <li>and when I shaved the next day I noticed more drag.</li>
            <li>I started with one bottle of Shave Secret and liked it so much I bought the 8 pack about a year ago from the website.  </li>
            <li>The oil has a slight clove smell, but is not so strong that everyone smells it.  </li>
            <li>So far, my experience with Shave Secret Shaving Oil has been a good one.</li>
            <li>Ditch your million blade, vibrating, colorful plastic razor, buy a nice metal safety razor, and give Shave Secret a try!  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive sink</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Been shaving for a long, long time and this is the first shaving aid I have found that actually does make shaving better.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m already on my thrid purchase, and one little bottle last a very lone time, much better than any shaving cream I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>I use a DE razor and Shave Secret, and the combo has been very effective for me over the last six months.</li>
            <li>Normally I will shave in the shower or after I get out so my skin will be moist and the hair soft.</li>
            <li>My recommendation is to 1) wet the face with warm (not hot) water, 2)</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>I first used this product for shaving in the field during The Basic School.</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I massaged 3 drops into my head, got my Mach3 razor out (the lube strip was already eroded on it), placed it up to my scalp, took a deep breath and gulp and made my first stroke.</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>This product was OK but not better than the Proraso pre-shave.</li>
            <li>But as far as having the smoothest shave of my life, this is it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure why shaving cream exists when this is so much better.</li>
            <li>been using for 6 months and still have about 20% of the first bottle left.</li>
            <li>Much better just to apply a small amount of regular body lotion to shaving area followed by hot shaving foam.</li>
            <li>I also use a bit more than recommended even though I have a small face I&#x27;ll use maybe 7 drops.</li>
            <li>I only used two drops on my hair line and for the first time I didn&#x27;t carve myself up...</li>
            <li>my lovely and gracious wife gave me a shave kit that included a small bottle of shave oil.  </li>
            <li>I usually keep a Fusion Razor for more than a month.  </li>
            <li>The small bottle will also travel better than even the travel-sized aerosol shave</li>
            <li>has given - by far!</li>
            <li>and I tried it for the first time last night, with some skepticism.  </li>
            <li>Except the whiskers mysteriously disappear and I can see them as they are flushed out of the razor when I rinse it under the hot water faucet.</li>
            <li>Except the whiskers mysteriously disappear and I can see them as they are flushed out of the razor when I rinse it under the hot water faucet.</li>
            <li>After trying many different methods I came to the conclusion that it must be due to the collard shirts and tie that I am required to wear for my profession.</li>
            <li>In addition, it&#x27;s not unusual to go a full two weeks on a blade.</li>
            <li>One thing for sure, if I do try a new razor, it will be with conventional shave products not this funky oil in a tiny bottle.</li>
            <li>And that little bottle packs away so easily in your bugout bag</li>
            <li>The main problem was I had to attack my beard from different angles and go over it repeatedly to get a close shave all-around.  </li>
            <li>I get a better shave from this than expensive gels, and it&#x27;s cheaper and easier to clean up after as well.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need a large amount, so it lasts a long time despite its size &amp; it allows for a very close shave, both with &amp; against the grain of stubble.</li>
            <li>I love the smell, slightly spicy clove, but it&#x27;s light, not overwhelming and after drying off</li>
            <li>Nice scent (if you like clove spice) and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve got super thick hair which is literally capable of dulling even the sharpest razor on the first pass.</li>
            <li>I saw that this one was cheaper and gave it a try first due to the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>As a result I went back to dry shaving which continues to work fine.  </li>
            <li>My multiblade razor glides over the scalp with tremendous ease in both directions - with the grain and against the grain with no razor drag.</li>
            <li>A few drops and some hot water and your golden.</li>
            <li>And, in a pinch, you can use it to cut off that meat bag&#x27;s hand when it grabs you through the fence and tries to pull you in for a quick bite.</li>
            <li>It definitely cuts down on nicks and even let me run against the grain above my lip, which I&#x27;ve never been able to do in the past without a lot of digging and catching regardless of razor angle.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Shave cream&#x27;s are light and fluffy and there&#x27;s a reason for that: you want to lift the hairs and not dull the razor.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is fantastic for day to day shaving, no need to mess with a brush and soap.  </li>
            <li>This stuff might work ok for young faces, but not older wrinkled, dry faces like mine.</li>
            <li>Be forewarned, what other reviewers say about clogging the razor is true.</li>
            <li>Purchased another product recently (just to compare) and it works better and smells less.</li>
            <li>Well, go ahead, be skeptical because I&#x27;m telling you this is the best thing since sliced bread and black thread.</li>
            <li>I began using Shave Secret because it is great for travel -- a single bottle replaces shave gel and after shave.  </li>
            <li>I think if I were using a manual safety razor this product would be worth a closer look as it surely is easier and less messy compared to foams.</li>
            <li>my skin takes a beating, never get it close enough on certain parts of my face under my jaw, and I start breaking out within a day or two.  </li>
            <li>I got ingrown hairs,razor bumps cause my skin is very light sensitive and my hair is thick and curly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It significantly reduces skin irrational resulting in less breakouts.</li>
            <li>, I think that&#x27;s mostly because the razor is dull after</li>
            <li>These all develop a richer lather with better lubrication than any of the hard shaving soap bars, even glycerine.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Order a second one because it will replace your main shave cream/gel!</li>
            <li>I bought this because I&#x27;m a girl who has hirsutism (male pattern hair growth on a  woman), so I need a very, very close shave to feel normal and properly feminine.</li>
            <li>I was surprised, but this actually works really well.</li>
            <li>The product is clear, so as you apply it to your face, you can&#x27;t see it, nor can you feel it on your face.  </li>
            <li>My neck is sensitive, and always gets bloodied up.</li>
            <li>/&gt;As far as usefulness goes-</li>
            <li>With this oil and the electric shaver, that is completely gone.</li>
            <li>Wow</li>
            <li>just wow.....</li>
            <li>I will say that for the cost and how long I think it will last pretty much outweighs the smell.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m soft, not scaly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will recommend any pre-shave oil that is much thinner if you are using a double edged safety razor.</li>
            <li>You can also go directly to the \\&quot;shave secret\\&quot; factory site and get it in bulk (which I do).  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised how well this stuff works.      </li>
            <li>Use Neutrogena Sensitive skin after shave lotion (again, every day...don&#x27;t stop using it just because you used it once).  </li>
            <li>You will be surprised by this product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been testing different ways of getting a really close shave.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my husband who has sensitive skin and prone to ingrown hairs and razor burn on his neck underneath his chin.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and a roommate</li>
            <li>and WOW all that I can say</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much easier now for me to get symmetry and line up my facial hair.</li>
            <li>I have to use an old toothbrush to dislodge the residue between successive strokes.</li>
            <li>With a safety razor, there&#x27;s no need to rinse at all until you&#x27;ve finished your shave unless you haven&#x27;t shaved in a couple weeks, but a cartridge razor would get clogged and need to be rinsed frequently.</li>
            <li>A guy can&#x27;t get any action when he&#x27;s all nicked up, with hair bumps and all rashy looking....</li>
            <li>have sensitive skin, and this product has never been an issue.</li>
            <li>Another perk is that this is all natural oils rather than a bunch of chemicals.</li>
            <li>I have a sensitive neck area.</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Pleasantly surprised that this works as well as it does.</li>
            <li>I did have to adjust how often I rinse my blade, since the tiny spacing between modern blades makes it clog faster.  </li>
            <li>My thoughts are old guy smell</li>
            <li>If you are a guy who only wants it for your face, 5 star rating.</li>
            <li>and I have an extremely sensitive neck,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve shaved with it three times so far.  </li>
            <li>No messy foam and dryness of the skin.</li>
            <li>I have tried nearly every cream, soap, lotion, razor, and shaving technique...</li>
            <li>use it with: Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood Shaving Cream Bowl, 5.3-Ounce&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Pacific All Natural ([[ASIN:B000FNEWL0 Pacific Shaving Company Natural Women]]</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>I agree with most of the negative comments.  </li>
            <li>My husband has sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin on my face/neck and have not had any irritation using this.</li>
            <li>See how far it gets you.  </li>
            <li>About as far as this will.  </li>
            <li>Though I do have really sensitive skin, so it may work for you.  </li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin, give this product a try.  </li>
            <li>Works very well, I especially like it when I&#x27;m in a hurry.</li>
            <li>I also like the fact that the oil is not heavily scented.</li>
            <li>NOT MESSY</li>
            <li>But... after learning (yes, I can still learn in my old age), that I should be shaving my chin and neck instead of plucking at it</li>
            <li>It is not messy and does leave my skin feeling soothed after a shave with an electric razor.</li>
            <li>yet you only need a drop or two for your whole face</li>
            <li>It really DOES give me a closer shave that does seem to last longer.</li>
            <li>It has completely revolutionized my shaving experience.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 61 years old, started shaving when I was 16.</li>
            <li>I use the grooming lounge shave oil but decided to try this for travel,  wow,  </li>
            <li>All I can say is wow.</li>
            <li>Moisturized and soft...</li>
            <li>Comes in a tiny bottle, but you&#x27;re not supposed to use much product.  </li>
            <li>I frequently nick myself and end up with razor burn.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;-I have always frequently rinsed my razor.  </li>
            <li>I feel like I was completely ripped off.</li>
            <li>For years I looked for a nonalcohol natural mousturizing after shave.</li>
            <li>If everything locks up in another six months I&#x27;ll update my review, but so far so good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I sometimes use an old toothbrush to declog.</li>
            <li>I think you will be pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>Would like to use something natural to shave, but this is just not working.</li>
            <li>Then I apply Taylor of Old Bond Street Lavender shave</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft and refreshed.</li>
            <li>Followed all the instructions and it made the non trouble spots baby smooth.  </li>
            <li>Wow.  </li>
            <li>I have eczema, and I had been purchasing the \\&quot;sensitive skin\\</li>
            <li>Having come this far on my shaving journey, I thought, &amp;</li>
            <li>like they did when I was five years old, like the proverbial baby&#x27;s butt.</li>
            <li>Having come this far on my shaving journey, I thought, &amp;</li>
            <li>like they did when I was five years old, like the proverbial baby&#x27;s butt.</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive, and my chin is pointy and dimpled, and shaving is a pain.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;ve been getting more conservative haircuts lately, and I wanted a conservative shave to go with it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m completely sold.</li>
            <li>That this product is quickly absorbed and requires only a few drops, made it worth trying for me.    </li>
            <li>/&gt;Definitely try this before you try a more expensive brand, it will be worth it.</li>
            <li>A few more if necessary.</li>
            <li>I have spent so much money over the years trying to find a natural shaving cream/gel/oil that works as promised, and this is definitely one of the few I&#x27;ve found to be effective (ZIRH Pre-Shave Oil and Shave Gel are the others).</li>
            <li>I have seen many gimmicks out there but Shave Secret is the real deal.</li>
            <li>Take one drop of Shave Secret with warm water and rub it on the area after every shower.  </li>
            <li>I cannot say enough good things about Shave Secret.</li>
            <li>That was this morning and for the rest of the day I would rub my hand across my smooth bald head and smile at the secret I had just discovered.</li>
            <li>Shave Secret helps reduce irritation by providing a nice oil buffer between hair and blade.</li>
            <li>but the shave I got is one of the best, closest, least irritating I may have ever had.  </li>
            <li>Putting this oil on your face creates a thick layer of oil and putting shaving cream on top doesn&#x27;t do anything.</li>
            <li>It took a little work to figure out how to edit my original review of this product from years ago.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easier than trying to pack shave cream, and, because it&#x27;s so small, it fits easily into a quart bag for ease at airport security check points.</li>
            <li>I used 2 drops at first, put in the palm of my DRY hand, spread around and applied to face.</li>
            <li>First off, I am in the U.S. NAVY and space aboard a ship is limited.</li>
            <li>Seriously, Shave Secret is the best.</li>
            <li>No nicks either, and no mess associated with the brush and soap.</li>
            <li>The bottle is very small, you get many shaves out of it</li>
            <li>Close shave, no irritation or dryness, no mess to rinse off when your done.  </li>
            <li>Some recommend olive oil to give a barrier of the skin to prevent cuts, shave secret takes that barrier and adds a clove sent, it that allows the blatant smoothly transit ones face easy and safely.</li>
            <li>I am now shaving with coconut oil and like it much better, and my wife loves the subtle fragrance.</li>
            <li>The idea that you have to buy the latest 17 blade contraption is ridiculous to me.  </li>
            <li>For me it doesn&#x27;t lubricate enough initially and does not re-wet after first pass.</li>
            <li>Ok, I must admit that I was a bit skeptical of this product at first.  </li>
            <li>I use 5-7 drops of this as described in the instructions, but then I add a thin layer of normal shaving cream on top.</li>
            <li>Thankfully, it was the total opposite when I first used it.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical at first that I would not be able to use this as a shaving agent by itself for my corse face hair</li>
            <li>The smell was decent enough, not what I&#x27;d use for a cologne, but not overpowering, either.</li>
            <li>I have used a full bottle in a little over a.</li>
            <li>I had such high hopes for this product.</li>
            <li>Read the various postings to help you decide but believe me, shaving oil is a definite positive addition to your shave.  </li>
            <li>No more razor burns and my skin feels really smooth.</li>
            <li>It works very well, so long as you keep rinsing your blade out (which you should do anyway).  </li>
            <li>This is the first time that I&#x27;ve used an electric razor wet for shaving.</li>
            <li>I just get it wet with hot water.&lt;br /&gt;Shave as usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>First time using it followed the directions, 5 drops in a wet hand an massage it in and shave.</li>
            <li>I always wet my head and face first and then add 4 to 6 drops even though the directions say 3 to 4.</li>
            <li>I shave with an electric, and normally would only shave ever week</li>
            <li>Shave Secret has made shaving a lot better for me, a guy with sensitive skin who gets razor bumps frequently.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a dermatologist, but I stopped using this product and went back to normal.</li>
            <li>Not only did I get a close shave (following the instructions and tips for use on the back of the package), but the oil was easier to clean up after shaving, and left my skin feeling like I had put a balm on it... not greasy -</li>
            <li>I was a little disconcerted by the clumping of the hair in the blades, but just one or two  quick shakes in my rinse basin</li>
            <li>Husband at first found it confusing because he expected it to foam up, but once he discovered how little is used each time, he decided his face felt uniquely good.  </li>
            <li>I did not like was that my new razor clogged so much faster than with any other gel or cream.</li>
            <li>He has folliculitis and very curly hair, and even after some prescriptions and plenty of other products, this is his favorite and gives him the closest shave with the least ingrown hairs after.</li>
            <li>My next test is to shave with a not-brand new blade.  </li>
            <li>My face was irritated,  I tried using yet another razor from a different new package I had, and no difference.  </li>
            <li>in that the razor did not go over the skin very well (versus a dry shave without using anything).  </li>
            <li>Additionally, I found I needed to make sure the face remained quite wet because as it dried it became \\&quot;sticky\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Maybe I just have sensitive skin, but this doesn&#x27;t give me anywhere near enough lubrication for a shave.  </li>
            <li>Leaves skin feeling smooth and soft for at least 4 hours.  </li>
            <li>I saw this while at Walmart, where you can score this for about half the price as it is hers, and figured it was worth a try.</li>
            <li>Having facial hair is something I&#x27;ve dealt with since puberty and this is the only thing that really keeps my skin from getting cut up.</li>
            <li>product, soft and smooth, at least that&#x27;s what i was told.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had problems with shaving because I have such sensitive skin, and using an electric razor (Panasonic ES8103S Pro-Curve Wet/Dry Rechargeable Linear Pivot Action Shaving System, Silver).</li>
            <li>Aside from that i got very sensitive skin not only in my beard area.</li>
            <li>I usually follow with bump patrol (original formula) and then spf 30 face cream.     </li>
            <li>And I got a major razor rash after  trying this out.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do notice a major difference when I don&#x27;t use the oil.  </li>
            <li>Major benefit</li>
            <li>This is a major plus and why I will continue using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I loved it, but was very disappointed to find it was well over $25 dollars to order more when the tiny sample bottle ran out.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Finally, I&#x27;m convinced I get a better shave with less irritation, and it takes less time.</li>
            <li>I have sensative skin and tough beard this oil made shaving painless and smooth!</li>
            <li>This also works amazing on every, and I do mean every other area.</li>
            <li>It was a little unusual at first, as you use only 3-4 drops of the product mixed with a bit of water.  </li>
            <li>generally shave every day, but after using this, the shave was so close</li>
            <li>I was afraid that this tiny, much cheaper option wouldn&#x27;t just be as good, but I&#x27;m glad I was wrong</li>
            <li>maintain a french cut beard and I was looking for a clear shave solution so that I can shape my beard...</li>
            <li>According to the manufacturer&#x27;s website, if you experience razor drag add more water, not more product.</li>
            <li>ALso...to get the minor clogging in your razor out, buy a cheap toothbrush give it a few wipes at the end of each shave....</li>
            <li>I could make multiple passes without irritation, ending up with soft, baby-smooth skin.</li>
            <li>Also, the 5 drops as sdvertised is no where near enough.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shaving foams are mainly soap-based which dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product, especially if you have a sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The thing is that 3 drops will barely cover 1 side so I use 10-15 drops for face and neck.  </li>
            <li>I can still get nicks and bumps if I&#x27;m not careful</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m barely about to run out</li>
            <li>Because of how sensitive my skin has always been, I&#x27;d only shave twice a week.  </li>
            <li>Never really thought about shaving as much before.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was out to look for a shaving option that provided a close shave and did not empty</li>
            <li>There is no rinsing required after your shave, simply wipe your face with a soft washcloth and let the oils stay and soak into your skin</li>
            <li>will say I was pleasantly surprised that my skin  was not irritated, nor did it break out later.</li>
            <li>I remember seeing my Dad&#x27;s whiskers and unshaven beard after a week of canadian fishing and thinking \\&quot;Wow that looks like white sandpaper on his face!\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>: barely perceptible.  </li>
            <li>Last week I ran out again and thought I would try to use up some of my old shaving cream and shaving gels before I reordered again from Shavesecret.  </li>
            <li>I have a coarse beard and sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>but I had some cuts and nics near my upper lip.</li>
            <li>I think you will be pleasantly surprised., but it is definitely not a scent that anyone would mistake for a cologne.  </li>
            <li>but I am never going back to the old way.</li>
            <li>Ok not great.</li>
            <li>But I can shave with Shave Secret and get an even better, as well as quicker, shave.</li>
            <li>, You have to use much more than 3 drops and the consistency is just too thick (especially for double edged shaves).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The secret of course is to use plenty of water at the start and re-wet as needed, not add more oil.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather use shaving cream; it comes out of the can as a foam; no need to add more water or keep pushing it around your face unlike shave secret.</li>
            <li>If you have thick, fast-growing, blade-resistant beard hair, this oil alone will not give you a comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>spread Shave Secret on your face, and then use a shaving cream on top of it (I like Proraso).</li>
            <li>I have tried many products, but now I&#x27;m sold on shave secret.</li>
            <li>I came across Shave Secret and could not believe that a $5 product could compete with pre-shave oils that cost $30 or more.</li>
            <li>Well, OK, I can think of some things that would be worse, but picky legs still makes the list.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s really a secret though, if it were I wouldn&#x27;t have been able to buy it.</li>
            <li>I inherited a fast growing coarse beard that just gets more difficult to shave as I age.  </li>
            <li>I love shave secret oil.</li>
            <li>At that point I heard about Shave Secret Shaving Oil and :I was also at the point of needing to order more Harry&#x27;s blades.</li>
            <li>At that point I heard about Shave Secret Shaving Oil and :I was also at the point of needing to order more Harry&#x27;s blades.</li>
            <li>So toss that crap and get yourself a good, quality straight razor!</li>
            <li>and i would say it irritates a little less than most of the shaving gels</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s really not that strong at all and after a little while it goes away.</li>
            <li>Once I felt the razor glide the first time down my face with no drag, I was speechless.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, put me down as a skeptic-to-SSSO fan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: After a few weeks of using SSSO, a couple more observations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, this Shave Secret allows me to cut right through it all on the first pass</li>
            <li>I cannot believe a few drops of oil will keep a real razor from killing my face and offer a very professional close shave.  </li>
            <li>With a single application you can shave at least twice just by putting more water on the shaving area.</li>
            <li>I even tried wet shaving for a bit with limited success.</li>
            <li>First of all, I&#x27;m a black guy.</li>
            <li>Also, considering I was paying $18 per bottle for my previous shaving cream, this is an absolute steal!  </li>
            <li>I am not sure where the other find the smell is &amp;#34;mild&amp;#34; or ok or that it goes away.</li>
            <li>My husband has to shave daily for his job and it gets painful, so I was so happy when he told me this works</li>
            <li>cheap enough to at least try out for those still experimenting</li>
            <li>When I tried \\&quot;The Total Shaving Solution\\&quot;, it worked much better compared to Shave Secret.  </li>
            <li>Since Amazon doesn&#x27;t sell Shave Secret with Prime shipping, I found I can get a better deal locally than I can online, but your mileage may vary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li>Like so many others, I was introduced to Shave Secret in a race swag bag a couple of years back.  </li>
            <li>I loved the idea of carrying such a teeny tiny little bottle in my Dopp kit, but this stuff is No Good.</li>
            <li>tried to shave and found it a major irritation, I finally figured at that point the product was not going to work.  </li>
            <li>First off, I buy this stuff at walmart for a little over $2.</li>
            <li>Would prefer scentless and not sure how much better it is than other shave oils, but it definitely gets the job done.</li>
            <li>the flip side of that small negative, you can safely run your hand over your face to feel for those spots that have yet to reach the classic BBS state without smearing lather off.  </li>
            <li>The mileage I get from this little bottle is unreal as I bet it last 6 to 9 months or more with me using it everyday.</li>
            <li>product is exactly what is says it is, no more, no less.</li>
            <li>only reason to use this product is if it reminds you of your trip to Petra, you need something super small for your travel bag, or you want to smell like cloves.  </li>
            <li>Even though the instructions say to only use three drops I generally use five, and then put shaving cream over that</li>
            <li>I like the way it travels too, small enough to fit just about anywhere and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>The small size of this product alone makes the purchase worth it.</li>
            <li>Shave secret shaving oil (purchased from local Walmart) is undoubtedly better than the standard shaving gel or cream.</li>
            <li>By running water over the blade often, I never experienced it becoming clogged/</li>
            <li>Good face prep, especially hydrating your skin and beard,is the key, as is a sharp blade, but Shave Secret is the critical next step.  </li>
            <li>It allows the longer hairs to clog the razor easily and they are tough to rinse out.</li>
            <li>I have really coarse facial hair and just started going old school and bought a twist to open safety razor last week from here.      </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m actually not sure if I even used it right.</li>
            <li>Its true it does not smell like vicks, but it does have a bad cheap cologne fragrance that lingers.</li>
            <li>Just wanted to say, this very product and size can be had from Wally World for half the price!&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>I much prefer this product to typical shaving creams in a can.</li>
            <li>I have ultra sensitive skin and shaving makes my face &amp; neck feel irritated and dry.  </li>
            <li>BUT, I have found almost any oil will work just as well (perhaps with more than a few drops but not much more).  </li>
            <li>My face was wet with hot water and I put four drops in my wet palms.</li>
            <li>/&gt;As a long time wet shaver and straight razor user</li>
            <li>After warming the oil in hot tap water, it was still far too thick after applying it to my face.</li>
            <li>It is marginally better than plain baby oil, and it occupies little space in your toilet kit.</li>
            <li>I suspect it&#x27;s because of the heavy marketing supporting the various foams and gels from the big name brands.  </li>
            <li>I suspect it&#x27;s because of the heavy marketing supporting the various foams and gels from the big name brands.  </li>
            <li>When I ran out of the spray, I went to the local shopping center to get a new can.  </li>
            <li>And the shave is a little less comfortable than shaving with a traditional shave soap (Not the canned stuff.</li>
            <li>A &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; if you suffer from dry, sensitive skin and an essential for newie westshavers.</li>
            <li>Downsides are that it is not easy to see where you have shaved, and you must rinse the razor frequently in hot water or the oil and hair mixture turn into a solid that blocks the razor.</li>
            <li>It actually pushes the top blade down so that the hair, oil, shaving cream, etc... is forced out from between the blades.</li>
            <li>I definitely notice that razor burn occurs far less frequently.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had shavers foliculitus for a few years now and this certainly helped.</li>
            <li>I have a fairly heavy beard and while I have a beard and have less real estate to groom, it is  nevertheless one of my least favorite rituals.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have much of an odor, maybe a little woody</li>
            <li>It has a distinct smell that is really hard to wash off.  </li>
            <li>This didn&#x27;t really eliminate my getting a rash near my delicate area...</li>

            <li> and I&#x27;m very happy with my decision to try it.  </li>
            <li> Best if you use some soap with it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Best results</li>
            <li> Is it the best shave ever?</li>
            <li> Best shave product made!</li>
            <li> Great product !</li>
            <li> /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Produces an excellent shave.  </li>
            <li> I could get my hands on to see what worked best (for me of course).  </li>
            <li> Use it with my Panasonic, and it does great!</li>
            <li> If you shave every day this bottle would be awesome!</li>
            <li> Best shave ever.  </li>
            <li> This shave oil is it&#x27;s best when used as a pre-shave oil.  </li>
            <li> so it is still my best shave.</li>
            <li> Best shave</li>
            <li> I have been very happy with that razor.  </li>
            <li> He says this is the best product he has ever tried.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not the greatest discovery ever, as represented by the radio commercials.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great product!!</li>
            <li> Best shave product ever!!!</li>
            <li> I use the excellent [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best thing I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> it the best shave ever!!!!</li>
            <li> Product is perfect and works great, I hope they didn&#x27;t stop producing it!</li>
            <li> I think this oil is a very good choice for me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how it would work with those 20-blade, high-tech, spring-loaded, razors made from unicorn horn and priced accordingly, but for the old-school DE Safety, it was very good.  </li>
            <li> Very good, protects the skin as it claims, no nicks or cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also found with this oil that even cheaper razors now give a very good shave.  </li>
            <li> The aroma isn&#x27;t very good.  </li>
            <li> Great Price, Great Product!</li>
            <li> The shaving creme was incredible in that it gave me a closer shave than ever.</li>
            <li> This is the best way to shave that I have found, and it&#x27;s great for travel too, because I can keep a bottle in my travel baggie and not think about it when I&#x27;m packing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Really good stuff!</li>
            <li> I cannot tell you how delighted I am with this product!  </li>
            <li> Good stuff!</li>
            <li> It does smell good though!</li>
            <li> Good job with this product!</li>
            <li> Plus, it smells great and feels good!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as good as the Art of Shaving oil, but it&#x27;s still very good and it will help your shave.</li>
            <li> This works great.</li>
            <li> I still use shaving cream after applying this oil, and it works great.</li>
            <li> Great product that I have been using know for about a year.</li>
            <li> And the results were great.</li>
            <li> The product is great, but spendy.</li>
            <li> C.O. Bigelow which is great)</li>
            <li> Great stuff.  </li>
            <li> I was perfectly happy with my old-fashioned safety razor and soap &amp; brush combo.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is great.  </li>
            <li> Works great.</li>
            <li> Great way to get a close shave</li>
            <li> This product works great for me.</li>
            <li> My head feels great</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> Then I had a Braun electric high-end model, which I was really happy with.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s great, no nicks or cuts, surpasses gels</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work that great with my waterproof electric, but I like that u can reactivate it by re-wetting your face.</li>
            <li> In addition to convenience, it provides a great shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.  </li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> I use this on my legs and bikini area, and it works great.</li>
            <li> This is great</li>
            <li> I used 6 to 9 drops to shave and it feels great</li>
            <li> Plus it smells great</li>
            <li> This stuff works great.</li>
            <li> It smells great and you don&#x27;t have to rinse anything off except your razor.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, will be reorder as soon as I get close to running out.</li>
            <li> Too bad--it sounds great.  </li>
            <li> This stuff works great for both razors and electric razors.</li>
            <li> I also found that putting water in the sink with a samll amount of hand soap and pre-rinsing the razor in said soapy water greatly helps with preventing oil/hair build up on the blade.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  </li>
            <li> If $$ does it for you, then you&#x27;ll be happy with this one.</li>
            <li> I have to say, it worked great.</li>
            <li> Great shave with this.........</li>

            <li> But it works great underneath shaving cream.</li>
            <li> I can honestly say this is the best shave I have ever had.  </li>
            <li> Then I read about this stuff &amp; thought I&#x27;d give it a try &amp; it works great.</li>
            <li> Secondly-it is great.</li>
            <li> This works great if I shave every day.</li>
            <li> Works great both ways.</li>
            <li> Used it as a post shave a couple of times works great like that too.</li>
            <li> this works great.  </li>
            <li> The menthol also gives a cooling sensation which feels GREAT.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy I tried it....</li>
            <li> The stuff does a great job from a shaving software standpoint.  </li>

            <li> It did leave my face feeling great.</li>
            <li> and I have been great ever since.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It works great with a headblade, Panasonic Linear ES8103 (great for head shaving), and a Merkur safety razor.  </li>

            <li> AND it is effective on rashes, too!</li>
            <li> Smells nice too!</li>
            <li> Had to apply more than recommended amount to get the best shave our of it.</li>
            <li> For swimsuit occassions, I will be keeping this handy though!</li>
            <li> Put some more on and massaged it in real good.</li>
            <li> Smells good, feels good, and will make your skin feel great.</li>
            <li> It does give quite a close shave, and is a pleasant smell (unless you don&#x27;t like clove/menthol-y smelling things).    </li>
            <li> Pleasant and manly smelling.</li>
            <li> Aroma is pleasant and not over powering.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is pleasant.</li>

            <li> pleasant smell:</li>
            <li> It feels good on your skin and has a pleasant odor.&lt;br /&gt;-I have used this product 4 times and have yet to get a nick or any razor burn.  </li>
            <li> thought I had found a great shaving cream that was all natural, smelled wonderful, and was very good for my skin.  </li>
            <li> Smells good</li>
            <li> If this works for you or others, good -</li>
            <li> The shave is as good as razor blade with almost zero irritation.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Happily I&#x27;ve also found it to be a good moisturizer too.</li>
            <li> this product I picked up at walmart and I cant believe how good it is...</li>
            <li> It did do a good job as a pre-shave.</li>
            <li> Works nice, great product.</li>
            <li> Good seller, The item delivered on time, was as described.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s good for shaver.  </li>
            <li> : This is a good product because it works well</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll be good.</li>
            <li> but it did a really good job</li>
            <li> Smells really good though</li>
            <li> For medium to light bears, this would be the best product for you.</li>
            <li> its cheap, is long-lasting, and is literally the best shaving product I&#x27;ve ever used since i started shaving.</li>
            <li> When I&#x27;m done, I massage my face again and call it good.</li>
            <li> but it works good on my legs if I use a hand razor.  </li>
            <li> Good soap shaves closer for me.</li>
            <li> , then another, then I started smiling, I may have even audibly laughed.</li>
            <li> thought would be good for travel since it is so compact.  </li>
            <li> it does work fairly well as described.  </li>
            <li> and it smells good.</li>
            <li> This product is quite good.</li>
            <li> The product description sounds so good I was tempted to order some.  </li>
            <li> Then found it so good, that I use it even when not traveling.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t tried a blade, but I&#x27;d expect similarly good results, as I noticed with TSS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good stuff.</li>
            <li> I am now a believer and can say good bye to nicks, cuts, and burns.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a good practice to use the alum bar because it serves as a good indicator for when you need to replace your razor blade.  </li>
            <li> It also feels good after the shave, I guess from the menthol.</li>
            <li> Feels good too.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
            <li> Works surprisingly well with my Panasonic ELS63 shaver that can also be used with water.</li>
            <li> Good Stuff.  </li>
            <li> It is fantastic for travel, though, so I keep it in my travel kit along with the Venus Snap razor, and the combination is excellent.</li>
            <li> The oil from &amp;#34;Art of Shaving&amp;#34; is way overpriced and this stuff works just as good.</li>
            <li> I do not think its a good product at all.</li>
            <li> this is really as good as I think it is.</li>
            <li> works great.could&#x27;nt believe how good it works.</li>
            <li> Just use a good safety razor, badger brush, quality cream/soap, and a good after-shave balm.</li>
            <li> Gave it as a gift, my friend loved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The oil tends to stay on my face and can be a good thing in winter</li>
            <li> my skin feel really good.</li>
            <li> Still looking for a good all-natural shaving gel.</li>
            <li> Plus the smell of it is good too.</li>
            <li> The oil does a good job as advertised.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on all the good reviews.</li>
            <li> The oil is supposedly good for your skin.  </li>
            <li> The oil is supposedly good for your skin.  </li>

            <li> It&#x27;s a good</li>

            <li> Now I am good to go.</li>
            <li> Drop control is good.</li>
            <li> Excellent, everything said about it (good) was true.</li>
            <li> Not a bad choice, but not the best choice.</li>
            <li> This is effective, and generally pleasantly scented.  </li>
            <li> It was delivered quickly and was packaged flawlessly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m a very satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> My skin feels great and is as smooth as a babies bottom!    </li>
            <li> /&gt;Shaving is great and better than with aerosol foam.</li>
            <li> Save even more money on this great product.</li>
            <li> I get an incredibly close smooth shave with no irritation</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think a fly can sit on your face after and they will fall :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very glad I read through some of the reviews and Q &amp; A</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use more than a smidge, it works great.</li>
            <li> Although it is not as &amp;#34;thick&amp;#34; as the oil I had been using, buying a bottle for $7 as opposed to $25 or more was attractive to me</li>
            <li> Great product love it</li>
            <li> Great stuff, I have been using it for many years.....</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant spicy aroma and washes away very easily without leaving your face feeling oily or dehydrated.</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Works better than any pre-shave I ever used!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> This stuff is phenomenal!</li>
            <li> Used it for the first time today and it worked great!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t ask for anything more!</li>
            <li> But the best use of this product is as a first layer --</li>
            <li> More please!</li>
            <li> Use more than the bottle says!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Going to spread the word even more!</li>
            <li> Glad I have Amazon Prime!</li>
            <li> Way too many pimples after using the shaving oil!</li>
            <li> Otherwise I would have said XX product worked better than this!</li>
            <li> for 6 months with Fusion razor, then purchased two more, and shipped to my Father and Brother.&lt;br /&gt;Enough said!</li>
            <li> This is a great product that makes shaving so easy.</li>
            <li> It is an oil that with three drops does a better job than a hand full of the best shaving cream.</li>
            <li> Makes his life more pleasant.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell of the oil is pleasant, but it is not something that most men would like to wear to work.  </li>
            <li> Once I got used to what I was seeing, the shave went very smooth, felt good even.  </li>
            <li> This stuffs amazing.</li>
            <li> Words cannot describe how amazing this product is.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li> Simply amazing.</li>
            <li> product is simply amazing.</li>
            <li> What was really amazing though was how well it kept up.</li>
            <li> Simple, effective, and best of all, a GREAT SHAVE.  </li>
            <li> This is an amazing product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> That amazing tingling feeling I get as I rub the lotion on the skin</li>
            <li> I use it with shave cream to get an amazing shave with no nicks or cuts,  </li>
            <li> The product it&#x27;s great, leaves your skin smooth and no irriting I use at shower everything datos since I recibe</li>
            <li> but this stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li> My husband says this stuff is amazing</li>
            <li> I liked the scent and the ease of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> do feel that I end up using a fair amount more than they recommend.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I purchased it to help keep a good edge on my beard by keeping it more visible than under shaving cream and it does that</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good stuff, but you will have to use more than recommended in the directions.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own.  </li>
            <li> I tried this product with a 5 blade razor and it gave a very close shave,the best part of all no irritation!</li>
            <li> It really is the best.</li>
            <li> I got a nice, close shave (no nicks.. knock on wood).  </li>
            <li> It is also nice to see the skin not covered by foam.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but makes for a nice addition to my routine.</li>
            <li> I tried it as an electric pre-shave, but didn&#x27;t find it as effective as with a blade.</li>
            <li> Nice to find a product that exceeds expectations.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice that there is no need to rinse though.  </li>
            <li> Nice smell too.</li>
            <li> Nice scent.</li>
            <li> The clove scent is nice and not overpowering.</li>
            <li> Smells nice though.  </li>
            <li> The scent is nice, it lubricates well, and it is compact which is handy for travel.  </li>
            <li> Best product by far to enhance a Good Shave and head towards Exellence.  </li>
            <li> kind of a lemon/peppermint smell is the closest I can describe it.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what kind of miracle snake oil is in this stuff</li>
            <li> Nice to have a product</li>
            <li> Mix with water and provides a nice shave and tingling feeling</li>
            <li> I was expecting it to feel like oil, but honestly I couldn&#x27;t tell I had anything on my skin at all.</li>
            <li> I will always have to own this now.</li>
            <li> It does have a nice scent.</li>
            <li> And most of the time it was accompanied by a fair amount of razor burn.</li>
            <li> To each their own.</li>
            <li> I liked my mug&amp;brush.  </li>
            <li> But an oil rather than a cream does make the skin feel nice and prevents the irritation that often accompanies shaving.</li>
            <li> and I liked the fragrance of it.  </li>
            <li> So, there&#x27;s another nice</li>
            <li> Nice scent too.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell too nice either.</li>
            <li> Nice for pre-shave.</li>
            <li> Adds a nice cooling layer of lubrication.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li> and this bottle is always handy.</li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t know how they are aloud to make these claims.</li>
            <li> Kind of a nice, multi-purpose oil to keep around.  </li>
            <li> The menthol makes for a nice tingly sensation.</li>
            <li> Put some Foamy over top and it worked fairly well that way.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best I&#x27;ve used for shaving (I use a safety razor).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> good and is a nice oil :)</li>
            <li> Fragrance is nice and the menthol didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Smells nice, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> that you can get this a lot cheaper at Walmart, but as a product this one is really nice.</li>
            <li> A Panasonic model that came with its own cleaning system.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s nice, works well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been all over using safety razors cartridges and any kind of cream I could find.</li>
            <li> With Harry&#x27;s blade and Proraso soap I was getting a nice shave, even though it didn&#x27;t seem quite as close as I thought it could be.</li>
            <li> But the price was right (and reviews incredible), so I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> works great and smells pretty good too</li>
            <li> Plus it&#x27;s a very mild pleasant smell,</li>
            <li> Seems very suitable as a pre-shave oil for electric, but I could see clogging becoming an issue.</li>
            <li> On a positive note this product smells great; clove is certainly a good winter scent.</li>
            <li> This stuff is pretty incredible.</li>
            <li> I was super happy with the results.</li>
            <li> Anyway, since it IS oil, good luck gripping your razor with a safe grip.</li>
            <li> A quick rinse and I smell great</li>
            <li> I was very surprised but also very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> -  This is very easy to do.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall, a great product that is good for your shaver and your face!</li>
            <li> Very good with straight razors.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t believe this product isn&#x27;t more popular.  </li>
            <li> It gives a good smooth covering on the face.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s formula isn&#x27;t as good as others available.</li>
            <li> Oh ya, this is by far the best for shaving.</li>
            <li> We ended up getting 2 more bottles because it is so cost-efficient and effective on the face.</li>
            <li> Does a nice job and makes shaving with an electric razor much more efficient.</li>
            <li> I get a comfortable shave every time, it takes up no space in my medicine cabinet, and it smells good.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m impressed</li>
            <li> but wow what a great product!</li>
            <li> The oil itself is ok, nothing spectacular.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this I couldn&#x27;t believe how good it felt because I had never had a shaving experience as good as this</li>
            <li> That easy!</li>
            <li> - This sounds ridiculously easy to do, BUT in practice it&#x27;s NOT!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Inexpensive plus high quality adds up to a very good value for this frugal Scottsman.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell is mild, not offensive, I would say pleasant-</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how they came up with this, but it really works: smells good, feels good, does the job.</li>
            <li> It has a mild, pleasant smell and if you use an electric shaver like I do, it keeps the mechanics of the shaver oiled as well.</li>
            <li> It smells nice, it gives a good amount of lubrication and the price is right.</li>
            <li> But when you&#x27;re in the field, you don&#x27;t have hot water, a badger brush, and your great grandpa&#x27;s pewter shaving mug, do you?</li>
            <li> When I first saw it, I thought it would be great for travel, but now I use it all the time.</li>
            <li> I knew the claims were to good to be true.</li>
            <li> Apart from a mild, pleasant aroma and a refreshing tingle, this does nothing for</li>
            <li> The awesome clover scent is very earthy and clean -</li>
            <li> I got this oil from Walmart at a very cheap rate $ 3.82 ( 0.67 OZ&#x3D; 18.7 ml).</li>
            <li> very smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel very smooth.</li>
            <li> Highly Recommended and a must have for a good shave!  </li>
            <li> Has a nice clove scent, not too strong and doesn&#x27;t linger.</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly and in good condition and was given to my husband.</li>
            <li> Has a real cool interesting smell.  </li>
            <li> The packaging was beautiful, the price was right, the flexible head on the Harry&#x27;s razor comfortably followed the contours of my face</li>
            <li> I lather up some Proraso with filtered water and out it on top of this for a very smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> So far, Very good.</li>
            <li> Worthless...soap worked better.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting better shaves than ever and zero irritation.</li>
            <li> I have always been satisfied with the closeness of the shave on my face.  </li>
            <li> I have been able to even get those sideways hairs on my adams apple.  </li>
            <li> The best part about this stuff is that you can actually see what you are doing because there is no foam or soap lather.     </li>
            <li> A bottle lasts more then a month.</li>
            <li> I had to use a minimum of 10 drops, and could have used more.</li>
            <li> They love it too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Will be purchasing more and telling my friends about</li>
            <li> I really love this product, and have bought over 20 bottles and sent it to my home country, for dad, dad-in-law and others.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is much better than any foam I have used</li>
            <li> Its just OK...</li>
            <li> Bought a bottle for my best friend who had the same experience.</li>
            <li> Once I cut pack and just used 2 drops in each palm, I got better gliding and</li>
            <li> sure why it&#x27;s like $6 online</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I picked this up at the store.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t require many precious water bottles for the post shave rinse.</li>
            <li> (and for the most part would not reccommend) using aresols with this product.  </li>
            <li> He loves it and we will be buying more when he runs out.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t been able to work up a lather with oil,</li>
            <li> Seems to work ok.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s much better</li>
            <li> ; you get many mores shaves out of seven cans of cream than you&#x27;ll get out of this bottle</li>
            <li> Oil is better.  </li>
            <li> This product will even work well for women for shaving their legs, really comfortable and close shave!</li>
            <li> But if you can&#x27;t wait just wash your face after you shave. :)</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Well I am able to shave against the grain with no razor bumps and have a smoother shave as a result.</li>
            <li> I find that I need to use more than 3-5 drops per use - I</li>
            <li> After my face got used to the blade, it get a nice smooth shave with no cuts.</li>
            <li> The smell is interesting -</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> It works well, slightly better than Crew shaving oil.</li>
            <li> Using a shaving gel or cream on top of oil helps, but not neccessary.</li>
            <li> Using more water is also helpful.</li>
            <li> The container could be made more aesthetic (as you can see it resembles a glue from Home Depot or WalMart).</li>
            <li> But the Africa&#x27;s Herbal does too for tons cheaper plus leaves me better moisturized than the Kinexium.  </li>
            <li> I use it mostly to shave my head.</li>
            <li> Razor rash on my neck most of the day.  </li>
            <li> Once I get the appropriate amount 10-15 drops it works well.</li>
            <li> But it def takes way more than 5 drops</li>
            <li> Love the smell.</li>
            <li> This is not anti pimple cream, Nair or magic, like some people expect.</li>
            <li> Better how?</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Because this is an oil, rather than a cream, you&#x27;ll need to rinse out your razor more.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Works OK.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> This has made it so much better.</li>
            <li> I use more than the bottle recommends though.</li>
            <li> Works OK, but overhyped by Hannity, et al.</li>
            <li> I initially tried this once without reading the instructions and wasn&#x27;t impressed.</li>
            <li> I was able to shave over my chin without ripping out my porcupine bristles.</li>
            <li> It was sooo smooth!</li>
            <li> and when I touched my head I was dumbfounded that my skin was also so smooth!   </li>
            <li> I went with 3 more drops for the rest of my face</li>
            <li> But as for my head, it was cut free!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> But it takes more like 10-15 drops.</li>
            <li> Used more and it clogs the razor</li>
            <li> Well, it takes more like 10-12 drops.</li>
            <li> Even more so when I put the recommend 5 drops into my hands and spread it on.</li>
            <li> My husband said that u have to use more than it says.</li>
            <li> but then I apply my shaving soap with a brush over the oil and that delivers a fantastic shave!</li>
            <li> Love the idea and reviews.</li>
            <li> favorite part is the post shave burn is gone.</li>
            <li> I wish I had ordered more than one bottle</li>
            <li> and yes I will be buying more.</li>
            <li> but you need to put more than 3 drops.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lubricates the skin and prevents cuts and razor burn way better than any shaving cream I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> He ended up using more than the recommended dosage</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome and you need just a tiny amount.</li>
            <li> Additionally, razor stubble gets clogged in multibladed razors which require more than rinsing for removal.  </li>
            <li> and it works better than any shave cream or soap I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also tried using it with much more than that.</li>
            <li> won&#x27;t be buying more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sticking to &#x27;em. :)</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to use it many times to get the benefits...</li>
            <li> this is better than a shave cream and allows me to shape my beard as there is no foam which covers my face.</li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> you, many others are okay.  </li>
            <li> its OK.</li>
            <li> .. I will now have to check prices more often before I purchase ..</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m pleased with the purchase and will buy again.</li>
            <li> Now I can shave more often.  </li>
            <li> in combination with shaving cream, it&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li> For the price you can&#x27;t find a better shaving oil.</li>
            <li> Yes, you could pay a lot more.</li>
            <li> Is much better than the \\&quot;King of Shaves\\&quot; oil which i&#x27;ve also tried.  </li>
            <li> Four stars because of the size of the bottle; a larger size would make this product perfect.</li>
            <li> It will work without water, but for me it works better with water.  </li>
            <li> A three or five ounce bottle would be so much more practical.</li>
            <li> But, after using this oil, my face was smooth, with no cuts, nicks or burns!  </li>
            <li> My wife loves my smooth face!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be ordering more when I run out.</li>
            <li> You can still get the job done - but more attention is needed.</li>
            <li> I found myself using more than the recommended</li>
            <li> Aside from many shaving creams and soaps, I&#x27;ve tried some oils and gels as well.</li>
            <li> After shaving I use a couple more drops as an after-shave and I&#x27;m on my way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> sure if it has been mentioned, but using this product extends the life of a razor by a week</li>
            <li> recommend you don&#x27;t use more than four drops.</li>
            <li> Absolutely phenomenal product, love it.  </li>
            <li> I found it in Target and thought it looked interesting.</li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t able to wash it off, even with soap.</li>
            <li> allows for a good shave with electric razor and more useful than shaving cream.</li>
            <li> I, like many others, had my doubts about this stuff.</li>
            <li> The results were better</li>
            <li> I need more like eight.</li>
            <li> and it was ok.</li>
            <li> We are going to be ordering more for family members.</li>
            <li> Christmas present win!</li>
            <li> 01-30-15  Gets better and better.</li>
            <li> It seems the more you use it, the softer and better it feels.</li>
            <li> Fantastic shave!</li>
            <li> More power to those who get some use out of it,</li>
            <li> Just follow the directions and like it says, rewet your face (or whatever you are shaving) and go over it one more time.</li>
            <li> it laughs at most razors and punishes me for shaving.</li>
            <li> This is something gels and creams have NEVER been able to do for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus</li>
            <li> Wasting more time during your shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I apply more?</li>
            <li> Boy am I glad I did.</li>
            <li> ok if I use a lot more than 3 drops.  </li>
            <li> Make sure to follow the directions and add more water after adding the oil.</li>
            <li> the product states if you require more lubrication to apply more water rather than product....</li>
            <li> more water: check...</li>
            <li> Ive used shaving (talc) powder sticks for 20 years with a norelco shaver and now I switched to a panasonic 4 bar blades and I tried the oil stuff to see if it is better.</li>
            <li> Enjoy!</li>
            <li> I ordered two more bottles and gave them to friends.  </li>
            <li> I bought 2 and use more than the recommended amount.  </li>
            <li> This stuff just works .... and smells much better than 20 weight. &#x27;)</li>
            <li> Another satisfied customer, and one who&#x27;ll return.</li>
            <li> There is no point in it, it works better on</li>
            <li> Whether 3 drops/5 drops/15 drops, more water/less water....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just OK..</li>
            <li> glad i discovered it ..</li>
            <li> I have never had so many cuts on my face in my life.  </li>
            <li> This stuff works well and allows you to see what you are shaving much better than lathered cream.  </li>
            <li> It works better on some days than others.  </li>
            <li> It is as though it is more viscous some days than others.</li>
            <li> It does take me more than the advertised 3 drops, but maybe that&#x27;s just me.</li>
            <li> My favorite after shave is Osage Rub for this task.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a gal, and I love using it for my legs.</li>
            <li> I am certainly glad I did.  </li>
            <li> and my skin is much better moisturized by the oil.</li>
            <li> just okay;</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hurt that&#x27;s for sure, but....</li>
            <li> it had a better smell, it would be 5 stars.&lt;br</li>
            <li> get a better shave with this oil alone.  </li>
            <li> Shave with the grain, apply more water and shave against the grain.  </li>
            <li> Like magic.</li>
            <li> Way better than shaving cream.</li>
            <li> me, I will just keep using the better shaving soaps and use this for</li>
            <li> Now, when I use the product before shaving, my face feels smooth, and nice after shaving.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> Definitely better than soap and more moisturizing than foams or gels.</li>
            <li> I like that you don&#x27;t have to add more product to your face,</li>
            <li> ordering more.</li>
            <li> You do need more than three drops.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lot better than using foam with an electric shaver (yes, I tried that route and it just didn&#x27;t work well for me).</li>
            <li> After turning 57 I finally enjoyed shaving.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is 1000x better than any shaving cream.</li>
            <li> I saw this and figured, the most I had to lose was $3.</li>
            <li> It seems to work ok</li>
            <li> The razor glides over my skin better than with shaving cream</li>
            <li> Is it magic?  </li>
            <li> product works much better than most shaving foams.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps the best routine is to shave prior to taking your morning shower.  </li>
            <li> How did it manage to remain under the radar of most men?  </li>
            <li> Perhaps the best routine is to shave prior to taking your morning shower.  </li>
            <li> How did it manage to remain under the radar of most men?  </li>
            <li> Seemed to have to go over it again more after using the shave oil as opposed to not using it at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s keeps skin most.</li>
            <li> Ok, I had read the reviews, so I felt I had to try the product.  </li>
            <li> (Be sure to rinse your razor often)&lt;br</li>
            <li> So I suspect I didn&#x27;t get the product evenly distributed, which accounts for the difference in it working better in some areas than others.  </li>
            <li> There are much better products out there.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> You have to make sure you do NOT use any pressure.</li>
            <li> Make sure you use a lot of water.</li>
            <li> But use it under a quality shave cream/lotion etc and it makes the shave 10X better than the cream alone.</li>
            <li> Just bought two more for backup.    </li>
            <li> Great for a fast touch-up-and-go.</li>
            <li> By better</li>
            <li> way better than shaving cream.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Works best when following directions:*</li>
            <li> /&gt;Best beard conditioner (most astringent):</li>
            <li> I also feel like King of Shaves lubricates my face better and spreads easier which lets me use the recommended 3 drops vs. the 5 or 6</li>
            <li> First of all, the smell isn&#x27;t that pleasant.</li>
            <li> This stuff works and is soooo much cheaper and better for you than ANY can of shave cream!!</li>
            <li> It really works and it smells fantastic!!!</li>
            <li> It gave me a great shave, was easy to use, did not clog up my razor, and left my skin free of irritation and feeling great.</li>
            <li> Also, clean your razor&#x27;s blades under warm running water while shaving.  </li>
            <li> Has a nice menthol after effect which leaves your face feeling clean and refreshed.  </li>
            <li> I get a very clean shave with it.</li>
            <li> I found that it is great to use along with the shaving gel I normally use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing because of the menthos component you face feels nice and cool after the shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Some people have reviewed that they don&#x27;t like the smell of it, I think it smells pretty good</li>
            <li> When I first bought this for my son, I had no idea if it was any good.  </li>
            <li> It is pretty good.  </li>
            <li> Works pretty darn good.</li>
            <li> Most easy and efficient.</li>
            <li> Quickly rinse my face with warm water</li>
            <li> I love the smell and it is strong.</li>
            <li> This oil is just awesome for shaving as it is thinner and slicker and makes the shave so much quicker but really sticks to my skin and keeps me from breaking out keeping me moisturized for hours and hours after the shave.  </li>
            <li> Ever since I heard a hairstylist say this was her secret to the best head shave ever at a charity headshaving event, I was happy that I discovered this product.</li>
            <li> I shaved with a straight razor for a year and liked it, but the time it took for me to do a good job without threatening my own life was a bit much.</li>
            <li> I find this added barrier of lubrication very important and comfortable.</li>
            <li> It certainly doesn&#x27;t feel this good after a shave.)</li>
            <li> The eucalyptus smell is nice, not too strong, and fades fairly quickly, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about smelling like a plant.</li>
            <li> I have heard this stuff works great when adding a drop to regular lather, but honestly I&#x27;ve been fine with it by itself.  </li>
            <li> I use this as pre-shave and still use a badger brush and shaving cream, on top of it, it makes a huge difference</li>
            <li> I love the menthol \\&quot;burn\\&quot; and I notice that even with a used blade I get a smooth, ultra-close shave.  </li>
            <li> AND - you&#x27;ll enjoy the shave more than with this stuff.</li>
            <li> It gave me the closest and most comfortable shave I have ever had.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great scent that makes me smell like a man, not a twelve year old</li>
            <li> i wasnt sure how smooth it would be for my straihgt</li>
            <li> Wow, this stuff is really great.</li>
            <li> This tiny bottle is full of the best idea ever.</li>
            <li> This is the smoothest and most cut free ever</li>
            <li> , (3) shave with a safety/straight razor, (4) lightly rinse, apply more shaving cream, (5)</li>
            <li> the oil makes the face soft and it shaves great</li>
            <li> The most comfortable shave I have ever had with a razor.</li>
            <li> Wish it was available in more stores tho.</li>
            <li> I enjoy shaving and most mornings</li>
            <li> The best way to use is wet</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got my closest, most comfortable shaves using a Schick Quattro razor with a four blade (plus edger) titanium refill cartridge.</li>
            <li> but no... dont care much for the smell, and i dont think it is good at all... doesnt slide well on skin, and doesnt shave any closer than anything else ive tried...</li>
            <li> could it really be THAT good?  </li>
            <li> the added hassle of cleaning the razor is worth the nice close shave.</li>
            <li> Super effective at helping to provide a comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> The only reason I did not give it the perfect 5 stars is that it can be a bit stubborn to get rid of out of your razor blades, but definitely not impossible.</li>
            <li> My husband has very sensitive skin and has tried many products for a good shave.</li>
            <li> It seems to work well as the first coating and to my knolwedge has provided a good clean shave.</li>
            <li> I found this based on other Amazon reviews and tried it and am truly impressed with the results.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It works better than anything else I have tried and has significantly reduced after shave</li>
            <li> I have used all the best shave creams along with my trusty $200 Feather DE razor and have tried all kinds of shaving products but this little bottle of oil is my most prized shaving product.  </li>
            <li> oil - you may have to re-clean your hands and face pores if your skin clogs easily</li>
            <li> using this product be sure to tap out your razor often, and clean it thoroughly when you are done.</li>
            <li> Did I mention easy to use?  </li>
            <li> smooth as silk and the closest most comfortable</li>
            <li> easily could.  </li>
            <li> the most comfortable, smooth shave ever!&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> This does not rinse off easily  </li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t like clove / menthol you may not like the smell, but SS goes on easy and the smell does not linger.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Does Not shave off as easily as described, does leave face feeling good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Another benefit is that I can easily see my stubble in case</li>
            <li> This product allows me to change the style easily as often as I want .</li>
            <li> This is an all in one,makes shaving easy and helps with irritation.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s as easy as that.</li>
            <li> If I have been good and shaving daily it is a nice shave</li>
            <li> It can clog up the blades of the razor if you don&#x27;t have strong water pressure.</li>
            <li> Has a somewhat strong scent that I like, but might not be to others liking.</li>
            <li> Nothing is perfect obviously, but this a step in the right direction.  </li>
            <li> It just adds gunk the first swipe and won&#x27;t be effective anymore.</li>
            <li> Kind of akward at first.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love it, but it&#x27;s not bad.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s just fine.</li>
            <li> 18.75ML...worked fine</li>
            <li> and it worked fine--</li>
            <li> It is light and it spreads easily across the beard.  </li>
            <li> Works fine every time.</li>
            <li> The overly-positive reviews are true, this oil is magical and amazingly cheap.</li>
            <li> I got a free trial of this and tried it out and couldn&#x27;t believe how easy the shave was.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is fine.</li>
            <li> Also, i you want to get a super close shave or want to &amp;#34;re-energize&amp;#34; the oil on your face, you do not use more oil.</li>
            <li> I can truthfully say that  a super smooth baby skin scalp is the result.</li>
            <li> I was a little reluctant to purchase this when I saw it at Walmart but the words on the packaging just got the best of me</li>
            <li> Not buying it then was a huge mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Smooth, simple, and smells great.  </li>
            <li> I honestly wasn&#x27;t expecting much, but this gives me an effortless, smooth shave with a safety razor using feather blades.  </li>
            <li> Huge rip off to buy online.</li>
            <li> Was looking for something fast and effective.  </li>
            <li> But it was free</li>
            <li> and you will get an ultra smooth feeling skin after.</li>
            <li> More than worth the cost.</li>
            <li> that silky smooth razor</li>
            <li> Its amazing, works really well, has made shaving a pleasure as opposed to a chore.</li>
            <li> I never get a truly smooth shave and have always had razor burn and blemishes in this area.    </li>
            <li> (okay, it&#x27;s just an old Tupperware container filled with some warm water )</li>
            <li> had I not got a sample in a goodie bag for free.  </li>
            <li> Smooth shave.</li>
            <li> I enjoy shaving with this in the shower.  </li>

            <li> This stuff is cheap at Wal-Mart and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> But its really really cheap at Walmart.  </li>
            <li> Vampires follow me around hoping to get a free sample.  </li>
            <li> I liked it so much, I bought my Dad and my brother a bottle as a gift.  </li>
            <li> This is a great product for anyone, especially if you travel a lot, or you are over the lather of the shave cream.</li>
            <li> I pay a lot of attention to the process of getting a close comfortable shave and</li>
            <li> and you get a shave as smooth as glass with no irritation and no need to even rinse.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic pre-shaving oil.  </li>
            <li> Works great with the old-style double bladed safety razor I shave with.  </li>
            <li> This product does last forever, helps lubricate your skin, and smells great.</li>
            <li> smooth shave...</li>
            <li> advanced shaving King Shaves]]</li>
            <li> Also I do like a the light spicy-clovey scent.</li>
            <li> Great gift for any male!</li>
            <li> You get a smooth shave</li>
            <li> I definitely found I had fewer nicks and it greatly reduced my razor burn.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unbelievably fantastic.  </li>
            <li> My face has never been so smooth after a shave.  </li>
            <li> closest, cleanest, nick free shave EVER.  </li>

            <li> Fantastic product, and</li>
            <li> IMPORTANTLY IT HAS PROLONGED THE LIFE OF MY RAZOR BLADE.</li>
            <li> One problem with this oil when used on the legs is that you can&#x27;t see where there is no oil, so the shave is not as smooth.</li>
            <li> Hey, you can&#x27;t beat free though</li>
            <li> and it just came out smooth</li>
            <li> This stuff might not work for everyone and there will be guys who enjoy the experience of all the prepping lathering and all that stuff over this product.</li>
            <li> He says it&#x27;s a smooth nick free shave.</li>
            <li> I never knew my skin would feel so smooth and</li>
            <li> /&gt;And once you start shaving, you better hope you got a powerful faucet &#x27;cause</li>
            <li> I use this with a DE razor and sometimes with a disposable if I need to travel light.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product.</li>
            <li> I get smooth, close shaves without any knicking.  </li>
            <li> I use my Feather double edge razor with great results.</li>
            <li> trash&lt;br /&gt;Close and Comfortable Shave&lt;br /&gt;Affordable&lt;</li>
            <li> It may sound like</li>
            <li> Now I make my own oil that is much cheaper with castor oil.</li>
            <li> not a &#x27;miracle&#x27; product but helps for sure....keeps the skin smooth and the blade glides over it taking the wiskers with it.</li>
            <li> I just wish Amazon would make the 12 pack available via Amazon Prime.</li>
            <li> I am glad some found it useful</li>
            <li> like a close, smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt shave.</li>
            <li> enjoy shaving for once in your life.</li>
            <li> What the oil does is allow the razor, whether it be foil or blade, to glide smoothly on the skin.  </li>
            <li> This is important because you do not always get all of the hair in one pass.  </li>
            <li> Enjoy your shave.</li>
            <li> This product genuinely changed my life.</li>
            <li> I think that baby oil or good old soap make for a smoother shave.</li>
            <li> I use a DE89bl razor and this product while good and functional, did not appear to be any better than my current canned cream.</li>
            <li> I shave in the shower and find that body wash is far superior than this oil.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is AWESOME, you have to try it, you won&#x27;t believe much of a difference this makes shaving, especially if you shave your head!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is not messy and smells good.</li>
            <li> I shave both with multi-blades and when i can a good old DE, and it works well with both styles of shaving.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised that it works fairly well.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is good shaving oil - The smell is reminisent of Old Spice.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smells cinnamon, strongly, but I&#x27;m willing to cope with that until they come out with a blend of oils that smells better.</li>
            <li> But if you use a &amp;#34;safety razor&amp;#34;, a razor with only one blade then you can get a very nice smooth shave with this oil.</li>
            <li> There are some other oils that are very good as well...</li>
            <li> I really does give a nice clean cut that is smooth.</li>
            <li> This stuff is for real!!!</li>
            <li> It was my first shave with NO nicks or cuts!!</li>
            <li> This doesnt completly solve the problem but together with nice exfoliaiton and straight razor I can control the problem for a close clean shave.5 stars no doubnt about it</li>
            <li> I like to take out Roamers with a smooth, clean face.    </li>
            <li> Wow, first off the stuff smells great.  </li>
            <li> I was able to feel the smoothness and enjoy it in first use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> - So you try to shave as normal, and in my experience some areas it works OK (just ok), and in others</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend over this one in particular, but it still holds its own.</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff!I&#x27;ve been using an old style double edge razor for a few years now and have searched for the perfect shave for a while.</li>
            <li> Previous to discovering Africa&#x27;s Herbal oil for shaving I was most happy with King of Shaves Kinexium.  </li>
            <li> Works great, as long as you continually rinse off your razor.</li>
            <li> I also noticed a significant decrease in in-grown hairs.  </li>
            <li> I have the most consistently close shaves ever.  </li>
            <li> I still would get an occasionaal abrasion, but it was a significant imrpovement, and now my preferred method.</li>
            <li> original bottle from the summer is just about to run out.</li>
            <li> but it sure does a great job especially if you pair it with a good sharp razor.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like paying $9 for anything with ML in the volume description, but I&#x27;m pretty sure</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this for traveling</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know why this product isn&#x27;t more mainstream, it still seems pretty elusive.</li>
            <li> This would be an unique Holiday gift.</li>
            <li> (yes, you have to rinse your razor after EVERY full stroke to keep it from jamming up), and leaves me remarkably smooth.  </li>
            <li> I really enjoyed using this product at first.</li>
            <li> Shaving is enjoyable for the first time in my life.  </li>
            <li> Worth the money!</li>
            <li> Put it on first and then use the gel or foam on top of it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Follow the instructions and you will experience a unique shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /smack my multi-blade razor more frequently to prevent clogging, but it was a very smooth</li>
            <li> No nicks or irritation, super smooth close shave.</li>
            <li> , I CAN LOOK CLEAN 7 DAYS</li>
            <li> just dry it with a towel and your skin feels great all day.</li>
            <li> It helps the razor glide against the skin and helps to provide a clean job.</li>
            <li> But until you wash your face clean this Oiley stuff stays on your face even after you shaved.  </li>
            <li> the shave powder is just easier to apply and clean up.</li>
            <li> I like the clean smell as well.</li>
            <li> I use this when I don&#x27;t have the time to clean and exfoliate my head and face.</li>
            <li> I also use a Gillette fusion about once or twice per week to \\&quot;clean up\\&quot; the hair missed by my Braun.  </li>
            <li> If anyone has tips for keeping your razor clean using this product please let me know.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not quite as smooth as shaving creme, but good enough to travel with.</li>
            <li> Pleasant, but it is definitely not a scent that anyone would mistake for a cologne.  </li>
            <li> I find myself doubting many of those positive reviews and whether some may have a vested interest.</li>
            <li> The whiskers do not clean out of the razor very good.</li>
            <li> : you can greatly reduce the gunk by exfoliating first -- I recently started using a hard-bristled body brush before hopping in the shower and have noticed a huge change.</li>
            <li> Be sure to use plenty of water, and have super hot water to clean your razor</li>
            <li> I have an entire bathroom sink area full of shaving products as I truly enjoy the art of a good shave</li>
            <li> the 2-3 percent of reviewers out here who lowballed the product are doing, or whether they have a special sensitivity to the ingredients, but I think the overwhelming positive response here should let you know</li>
            <li> I absolutely love being able to buy a box of razors that would last me a year for what you could spend easily on a month supply of &amp;#34;modern&amp;#34; razors.  </li>
            <li> To my surprise, the razor glided right over my head!</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s right under everyone&#x27;s nose at Walmart for a whopping $4 a bottle, and people are still buying all sorts of creams or goos or pre-electric liquids!      </li>
            <li> It is inexpensive, easy to use, smells great, slightly spicy, but not overpowering.</li>
            <li> Very easy to apply and gives a fantastic result, leaving skin soft.  </li>
            <li> My skin felt soooo smooth and soft and the shave was amazingly close (the first time!).</li>
            <li> falsehood.&lt;br /&gt;Eliminates the need for soap, gels, moisturizers - for me that was a full wagon of horse manure claim as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Terrific in every respect----performance was better than expected and service by the seller was great!  </li>
            <li> I found that it is also a good value for the money overall as not a lot is required.</li>
            <li> cannot say enough good about this product.</li>
            <li> but it actually smells good yet not overpowering.  </li>
            <li> Ok, I am very picky about what I use for my shaving needs.</li>
            <li> And 3-4 drops is really all you need. :)</li>
            <li> After I shave in the direction of the hair, I massage my face again (without adding any more oil) and shave against the grain for a really close shave.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the tip Amazoners :)</li>
            <li> Use on a soft warm beard ( I shave in the shower) before applying  the shaving cream</li>
            <li> It is OK, didn&#x27;t really notice a difference.</li>
            <li> The product didn&#x27;t really seem to help with the recommended number of drops, and adding more than the recommended number of drops led to my razor clogging.  </li>
            <li> It really surprised me how effective it was.</li>
            <li> It does give a good enough shave (</li>
            <li> (6) rinse with cool water, (7) apply aftershave</li>
            <li> I tried the instructions several times and I do not get any good results with this.</li>
            <li> OK, I don&#x27;t really know about that.  </li>
            <li> kind of like old spice.</li>
            <li> But it is cool after put it on skin.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make any lather like my lovely Proraso soap did, so I can&#x27;t really see where I&#x27;ve been shaving.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make any lather like my lovely Proraso soap did, so I can&#x27;t really see where I&#x27;ve been shaving.</li>
            <li> smell is a little strong, but makes for a great shave, it&#x27;s like my face is teflon</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews, but this is very worth of a review.</li>
            <li> After the first use, it was like a miracle come true!</li>
            <li> first tried it while I was using cartridge Mach3 razors and it always clogged the razors easily when combined with shaving creams.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty strong hint.  </li>
            <li> Be sure and clean your blade with a moist towelette before your next shave, though, OK?    </li>
            <li> Good luck getting a great shave, takes 3 times longer than normal, and I feel like I hardly shaved at all.</li>
            <li> and I used this oil and it at first worked excellent, especially for the sensitive neck area.</li>
            <li> I got an excellent shave, it&#x27;s not as messy as a can of shaving cream, plus it&#x27;s small and great for travel.</li>
            <li> Very small and handy!!!</li>
            <li> Have used every and all sensitive cream available, this is hands down the best I have used.</li>
            <li> I found that some of those areas on my neck that my new electric was finally able to get cleaned up to a reasonable degree, were no longer able to be shaved as well.  </li>
            <li> soap/creme mixture will quickly clog DE razor crevice - rinse often&lt;</li>
            <li> company that shipped did so quickly and even followed up to ensure that all had gone well.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really bother me, and the menthol does give it a kind of tingling feeling, but that doesn&#x27;t help much when I cannot use it at home.  </li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll need to give it a quick rinse.</li>
            <li> /&gt;this does have a mild oder</li>
            <li> Especially if you use a safety razor with straight razor blades (which are cheaper, and this stuff works great</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super allergic to eucalyptus.  </li>
            <li> I was very happy to find it on the shelf of my local drugstore for the same price as Amazon, but with no shipping charges.</li>
            <li> I will not use the product to shave with, but I will more than likely keep the top off of the bottle and fragrant the room.</li>
            <li> But three drops of this stuff and seriously, extremely QUICK, painless shave everywhere, legs, wherever you wanna shave, though I don&#x27;t know how it would work on the face.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I can&#x27;t tell if it really did much</li>
            <li> Using just 5 drops and no shaving cream I can get a super close shave.</li>
            <li> I smell good - not a strong smell, but pleasant and masculine.</li>
            <li> I have eczema - it&#x27;s very gentle, &amp; far cheaper and more luxurious than any after shave moisturizer out there!)  </li>
            <li> and brush may be better but working full time and have to leave very early in the morning</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t generally use aftershave with it, since it smells nice and does the job on</li>
            <li> Overall, very glad I tried it,</li>
            <li> and it does exactly what is says, smooth shave with no razor burn, bumps, ingrown hairs or anything like that.</li>
            <li> The instructions say to rinse with very hot water.</li>
            <li> It works exactly as described and my skin feels amazingly smooth and closely shaven.</li>
            <li> My final preferences are the soft soaps that come in pots like Proraso and Omega and best of all The Real Shaving Co&#x27;s Shave Cream in a tube.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;A shave for the very first time with</li>
            <li> Just running your fingers or hand under the tap won&#x27;t do you any good unless you use soap or whatever for a long while.</li>
            <li> The stuff works, gives a cool fresh feeling after the shave.</li>
            <li> But I end up having to clean and change my blades more frequently.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with the close shave and absence of any skin irritation.</li>
            <li> I had been doing DE razor shaving as a new hobby for two weeks and was burned every day doing every sure fire technique stated to stop it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy to travel with, it does a far better job than any other product I have tried, and the best part is that you can actually see where you&#x27;re shaving</li>
            <li> I thought this stuff gets great reviews and will take up less counter space.</li>
            <li> The shave oil is pretty good overall.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t cost you much for product so it will be easy money.</li>
            <li> This makes shaving fast and easy.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and most products will make my face breakout.</li>
            <li> TWO of this worked great, rubbed it into dry skin and proceeded to get the closest, most comfortable dry electric shave I&#x27;ve ever had.  </li>
            <li> I was HOOKED after the first use!</li>
            <li> Highly Recommended!!!</li>
            <li> It is the only shave oil I&#x27;ve tried, but it&#x27;s better than ANY shave foam I&#x27;ve used...period!  </li>
            <li> Thanks!!</li>
            <li> pretty close!  </li>
            <li> It works exactly as described!</li>
            <li> I enjoy using different high end shaving lathers with a boars hair brush, and did not figure this stuff would be comparable, but actually find it to be the best I&#x27;ve used, even over some of those $30 per container</li>
            <li> is also great for travel, this little bottle will last like 2 months or more!</li>
            <li> Much to my surprise, Shave Secret was easily the best of the prep products.</li>
            <li> I would say my facial hair is of normal coarseness, and fairly dense, and I only need to use 3 drops of this stuff to get a nice close comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I was a little worried about leaving it on my face when I was done (not washing the remaining oil off with soap), because I thought it would clog my pores or something, but I just dabbed with the towel like the instructions said, and my face felt great for the rest of the day.</li>
            <li> my legs it works GREAT as a lubricant before applying just a little bit of &amp;#34;Kiss my Face&amp;#34; shave cream.</li>
            <li> the positive side, the shave is reasonably good for my soft face hair, and it feels better on the skin after you are done because of the lubricating moisture that is left on your face.</li>
            <li> Following the directions, it works amazingly well.  </li>
            <li> Three drops, mixed with water, on the area to be shaved -- amazing.  </li>
            <li> Additionally, this product works great with 2-blade disposables, which are cheap (I like Shick) and work wonders -- in my experience, they do a better job than the fancy (read: expensive)</li>
            <li> a clove smell, more so than you would detect in an Old Bay aftershave</li>
            <li> It replaces your shaving cream, and with just 6 drops coats your face with enough lubrication to effectively trim your beard.</li>
            <li> the price its worth a shot to try it if you&#x27;re on the fence</li>
            <li> It even worked well on my head, which is a lot more sensitive.</li>
            <li> It worth the price.</li>
            <li> and I think this is well worth the $4.  </li>
            <li> The Shave Secret stays in place and feels great!</li>
            <li> All in all, wherever you buy the product it is worth the money.</li>
            <li> Heard about this on The Blaze radio, and figured it was worth $4 to try it out.</li>
            <li> Superior Stainless Double Edge blades</li>
            <li> With this product, my neck rarely burns and has fewer cuts.</li>
            <li> Also, it has a nice herbal smell that is left on your face.</li>
            <li> I thought it was the perfect opportunity to test my bottle of Shave Secret with a manual razor.  </li>
            <li> , this thing is just as good or even better than the pricier British import, I see myself buying lots and lots of this thing in the future.</li>
            <li> When the oil is more clear, it doesn&#x27;t cause a problem.</li>
            <li> I shave with a Merkur 180 safety razor, Derby double edge blades, and Van Der Hagen Deluxe</li>
            <li> But I have been trying different shave oils over recent weeks and have made a discovery of a much much better shaving oil that is additionally quite good for your hair and skin.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this product produces any closer of a shavethan my favorite shaving gel - \\&quot;Nivea Shaving Gel for Sensitive Skin\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> Nice basic oil to use for shaving.</li>
            <li> Best thing for Shave Secret is its price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, for the price I fell like i got my money worth.</li>
            <li> small, convenient, and it works beautifully.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li> Does gunk the razor up a bit though, but worth it for my exczema prone skin.</li>
            <li> Actually it&#x27;s kinda nice not having all the lathery fuss and muss.</li>
            <li> product is worth trying atleast once.</li>
            <li> well worth the cost in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s natural too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not crazy about the clove and menthol scent</li>
            <li> also laugh in the bumpy stubbly faces of all the foam users.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth buying often</li>
            <li> Shave Secret combined with Proraso made for the best shave ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am a woman struggling with PCOS, and shaving is literally the only thing that gets rid of the hair effectively.</li>
            <li> I can do multiple passes with this, without getting any kind of irritation.</li>
            <li> Overall a nice product.</li>
            <li> Just used a couple quick swipes with my straight razor and the hair slid clean off.</li>
            <li> I purchased this knowing that it violated the tradition and rituals of a good wet shave</li>
            <li> The feeling of this product was more aqueous that it was unctuous; being oil I guess i expected a bit more slipperiness.</li>
            <li> Smile.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been so pleased with the shave, moisturizing and natural fragrance of this product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very impressed by Shave Secret.  </li>
            <li> But it is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this product I winced at the thought of shaving without foam, but soon realized that it stands true to its promises.</li>
            <li> The same size bottle is available for $4 at most Wal-Mart&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> It leaves the skin feeling soft and healthy.  </li>
            <li> The thickness of Anthony Logistics and Art of Shaving causes me to break out, whereas as Shave Secret is a perfect consistency.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Worth the price.</li>
            <li> For the last couple of years I&#x27;ve been fooling around with razors, blades, and shaving creams trying to get a closer, more comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and thought it would be worth giving this a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But what surprised me the most was that I had achieved this despite shaving on a day</li>
            <li> Then a persistent TV commercial for the MicroTouch One Classic Safety Razor with 24 FREE blades caught my attention by promising &amp;#34;The Best Shave of Your Life!&amp;#34; That sent me off to search Amazon, my recent source for everything.</li>
            <li> I put the whole works in a drawer when Harry came along in an e-mail offering a beautifully designed $15 dollar razor and German-made four-blade refill cartridge that cost wa-a-a-y-y less than Schick, Gillette, or Wilkinson Sword Competitors.</li>
            <li> It has really help reduce skin irritation quite significantly.</li>
            <li> Rinse and tap, (hot water, stronger taps) not that difficult, fair trade for the good</li>
            <li> Used with a nice, soft badger brush I thought that combination was pretty much just peachy.</li>
            <li> This is very much like a French shaving oil I used years ago, a nice clove smell.</li>
            <li> But then, when I splashed a little water on top and got out the razor, I was amazed by how easy, painless, and smooth the shave was.</li>
            <li> either i&#x27;m not using it right</li>
            <li> I pair this with a Blade Buddy and all is right with my shave.</li>
            <li> , that is, IF I could find the right razor and product.  </li>
            <li> Dudes, and dudets, this right here...</li>
            <li> this stuff right here........</li>
            <li> You can feel the menthol, which is just right.  </li>
            <li> I always use it when traveling as it&#x27;s lightweight and just right, no need to bring shaving cream or aftershave.</li>
            <li> and he was right.  </li>
            <li> I take the time to do it right.</li>
            <li> Just soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth trying for the price!!</li>
            <li> + people to leave positive reviews on just about any web site, for a cut of the profit!</li>
            <li> But I will continue using my straight because I enjoy the ritual of using hot lather, etc.  </li>
            <li> Mainly if you can shave solely by feel and not by sight (because you can&#x27;t see where you have already shaved) and you don&#x27;t mind the menthol smell, this is a product that will give some of the smoothest feeling face and head shaves available.</li>
            <li> I have used this product over the past couple of years, and it is by far the best solution for getting a closer electric shave while minimizing irritation.</li>
            <li> The shave   was not bad; as I said it&#x27;s better than regular foam.</li>
            <li> It was at best a wet, but dry shave.  </li>
            <li> Works pretty well, but it gunks up your razor pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> I was concerned that my skin might be too oily afterwards, but after a rinse and a towel-dry it actually  felt soft and pleasant.  </li>
            <li> This product makes the whole shaving process insanely easy with zero irritation and is very compact which makes it convenient to travel with.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Results: with the hard soap bars it does help lubricate the skin better and give a more comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li> This product is great if you have an old single blade razor.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small size makes it is great for anyone travelling on an airplane.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first time was a sample I got in a Fun Run pack.  </li>
            <li> Once you menally get past it, it is great stuff.</li>
            <li> Shaving is easier with the lubrication, and it does work with the water on the face to spread remarkably well with just a few drops.  </li>
            <li> By far, after only using it only once, I encountered the best shave I ever had.</li>
            <li> last thing: if you use modern shave creams, use them *lightly* !!</li>
            <li> Not of good quality and not worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;Kevin T Maloney</li>
            <li> This little tiny bottle of stuff works awesome!!!!  </li>
            <li> I visited the \\&quot;Art of Shaving\\&quot; and got new insights into how to shave and what makes a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> This oil makes it a lot more forgivig toward those mistakes.&lt;br /&gt;After I was done not a single cut or knick.</li>
            <li> Shave Secret help me get an excellent shave under my neck area which I could not get very well with shave gels with making it irritated.</li>
            <li> For only a few dollars you get an awesome shave with just water.  </li>
            <li> When I am totally finished the shave, I massage 3 to 4 drops of the oil into my freshly shaven head and face for a healthy shiny glow.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to carry bulky shaving cream bottles but ended up loving the it so much that I now use this daily for shaving.</li>
            <li> For regular home use, I will stick to the men&#x27;s shave soap and brush, which is much more economical than both this oil and all the shaving gels and creams out there.</li>
            <li> my husband loves this stuff, it is pretty amazing how long a bottle lasts him (couple months..)</li>
            <li> A good multi blade razor with vibration and some Jack Black or Art of shaving shave</li>
            <li> Other shave oils require more, which is fine; I don&#x27;t care if I need to use 3 drops or 10.  </li>
            <li> The combination of this oil with Gillete Fusion Proglide ( 5 blade razor) is giving  very good result for tough beard.</li>
            <li> No, but it is very, very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Four drops on a wet face give a real smooth effortless shave.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used this product, I was amazed.</li>
            <li> Only thing I don&#x27;t like, it causes my razors to clump up with hair, and I go through more razors.</li>
            <li> Plus my skin feels so soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> Pretty versatile!&lt;br</li>
            <li> As others have mentioned, oil and hair can get clogged between multiple blades, so be sure to use an open-back design, which lets water flow between the blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ve eliminated razor bumps and minor cuts that I experienced with regular shaving cream.</li>
            <li> In fact, it&#x27;s cheaper, smells better, no greasiness in tub, and larger bottle.</li>
            <li> and although I followed it EXACTLY to how the instructions stated</li>
            <li> Thanks!  </li>
            <li> Does not lather, so you can see exactly what you are shaving.</li>
            <li> wash my face with hot water</li>
            <li> The oil seems to just keep spreading as I rub it in although it does not seem to at first.  </li>
            <li> Only four stars, though, because there are cheaper and better alternatives out there.</li>
            <li> I just went back to Wal-Mart and bought two more.</li>
            <li> I first saw it at work, a coworker had a sample and gave it to me.</li>
            <li> Works exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin, but this stuff makes shaving so smooth that I use it in place of shaving cream.</li>
            <li> After the first shave i was a convert.</li>
            <li> One application and rewetting was enough to get the most pain-free, irritation-free, cut-free, closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its okay and shaving with oil is definitely the way to go.  </li>
            <li> I usually shave my head 2 to 3 times at one shaving and one of the advantages to this product is that you don&#x27;t need to put more oil on the scalp or face area, you just add more water.</li>
            <li> And it doesn&#x27;t take much of the oil to shave!  </li>
            <li> I have since used an entire bottle and purchased two more, so I don&#x27;t run out.  </li>
            <li> I was interested in a   comparison.    </li>
            <li> I then added a 3rd drop for safe measure, and boom.</li>
            <li> one objection is the shipping cost, way too much!</li>
            <li> but I still wanted to do it the directed way first.</li>
            <li> so my head was already warm and wet.</li>
            <li> This oil along with my &amp;#34;Art of Shaving&amp;#34; non-scented shaving soap (I use a brush) gives me the closest shaving consistently.  </li>
            <li> This shave oil is getting a bit expensive but it is one of the best around.</li>
            <li> I first tested this product out in a trial size my wife got after running a 1/2 marathon.</li>
            <li> was quite surprised how smooth skin felt during shave.</li>
            <li> First, I shave in the shower.</li>
            <li> Works very well with the Blade Buddy and worth the investment.  </li>
            <li> If there&#x27;s still a lot of resistance, then you need to latter it with more water, and not oil.</li>
            <li> Not only is there no skin irritation, my skin feels better than ever.  </li>
            <li> Works just as advertised and leaves my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> From the descriptions I&#x27;ve read, I was expecting my razor to skim across my face like a hot iron on ice.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different shave oils:</li>
            <li> But after having tried so many others, I came back to this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this is the only shave goo that makes me want to shave more often.  </li>
            <li> I actually got a better shave from the Proraso pre-shave cream.  </li>
            <li> &#x27;s first though...</li>
            <li> I still prep with hot water and a towel.</li>
            <li> Love this product, I use it exclusively for my third pass</li>
            <li> I have not used shaving creme since I first tried this.  </li>
            <li> My first experience with a shaving oil - I WILL NEVER USE SHAVING CREAM OR GEL</li>
            <li> in all, I am pleased with it, and will likely buy it again.</li>
            <li> thanks!</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!  </li>
            <li> But, so far I am very pleased with this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Well, I finally tested this shaving oil with a used-once Gillette blade.  </li>
            <li> My face definitely feels much more moist with this over</li>
            <li> And try this alternative first.  </li>
            <li> More just isn&#x27;t necessary and it will clog a multi-blade razor.</li>
            <li> I first found this stuff in a goodie bag from a marathon.  </li>
            <li> They say it seems to help the razor rinse off better and last longer too.</li>
            <li> Used this product for the first time this morning.</li>
            <li> I find I actually examine my shave more closely instead of just shaving off shaving cream.  </li>
            <li> (I first saw it at an MCX on base)&lt;br</li>
            <li> advise to trim hair first if it&#x27;s over a quarter inch</li>
            <li> First, I have to use about three times the recommended amount of three drops.</li>
            <li> This oil works exactly as they say.  </li>
            <li> love this stuff, and it is the only product I use for shaving anymore.</li>
            <li> I have been shaving for many years, and in fact I&#x27;ve prepped patients for surgery for a total of 10 years, and I have never found a product as misleading as this has been.  </li>
            <li> , I tried it yesterday for the first time</li>
            <li> this is the first stuff in 25 years of shaving that lets me get away without blood or bumps.</li>
            <li> Not gonna lie, I was nervous about trying this the first time I bought it.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re ready to slice off some whiskers!    </li>
            <li> /&gt;In preparation, I wet my palms with some warm water and shook-off the excess, applied 3 drops (the recommended amount) and worked my palms together.  </li>
            <li> With the first pass of the blade I could feel the pull of every hair as the razor passed across my cheek...</li>
            <li> I applied two more drops and went in for a third attempt.</li>
            <li> can only assume that this product was designed to lubricate the hair follicle with oil so they pull from your face easier with each pass of the razor because it surely didn&#x27;t provide any glide to the blade as it passed on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> OK, I would not have been a believer but was given a sample in my goody bag after a recent 10K run.</li>
            <li> Just make sure you keep adding water back to your face or area, and you are washing out the razor under a Hot Tap.</li>
            <li> 3 drops on my face after a hot water splash.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!</li>
            <li> burn a bit at first.</li>
            <li> Has made my top ten list.</li>
            <li> Oh and after your done shaving your legs you don&#x27;t even have to moisturize, it makes your skin look and feel soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Had my first shave with this stuff.</li>
            <li> I was amazed when I first shaved with two days growth.  </li>
            <li> With the better soaps listed above it made no difference at all.  </li>
            <li> At first I was kind of skeptical but after using it for roughly 3 months I can say it&#x27;s the best shaving oil I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> Will definitely order more.</li>
            <li> That is the best shave Secret!</li>
            <li> It reminds me of dime-store old man cheap cologne.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant at first</li>
            <li> Now I tried this on many occasions with the same success, and I have to say I really, really tried to give this product the benefit of the doubt.  </li>
            <li> Since I have more growth than a daily shaver I use 5-6 drops per use.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t feel like much at first</li>
            <li> I first must mention that I follow the manufacturer&#x27;s instructions, but use it as a pre-shave oil, not a shaving oil.</li>
            <li> I ended up not with the MicroTouch magic product but with a Japanese twist-to-open Feather Razor and 100 Astra Platinum blades made in St. Petersburg, Russia.</li>
            <li> I first bought it at Walmart</li>
            <li> I use a double sided safety razor with Asrta Platinum blades (my favorite).  </li>
            <li> I tried it for a whole week, and it gave me razor burn twice!</li>
            <li> A few drops in the hand and you&#x27;re good.  </li>
            <li> I wish the product was a little more &amp;#34;Milky&amp;#34; in color so it would be easy to see where you already shaved.  </li>
            <li> in given how little this stuff costs, and how little you actually need to use, I think its a great value for a great price.</li>
            <li> Skin feels great after a shave, especially in the winter as the product helps with dry</li>
            <li> This happens with normal shaving cream as well but normal cream rinses easily off in the stream of water as you shave.  </li>
            <li> I have fair skin that is sensitive and varies from dry to oily.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t mean I&#x27;ll stop using shaving foam, because there are some great foam products out there also.  </li>
            <li> Incredibly it works even better than advertised, Works Fantastic with my Electric Razor, I initially wet my face with water 3 times, put 2 drops of secret shave in my palms and rub them and then rub it on my shaving area wet my face 2 more times and then shave.</li>
            <li> All the other reviewers here are dead-on: this is an amazing product that really works!  </li>
            <li> , i used a just a little more than the recommended 3-5 drops for the first time but after that everything was smooth.</li>
            <li> If you have delicate skin in your chin and cheeks, go for it it will help you a lot, I&#x27;ve tried many products and this works perfectly ,dont shave daily, alternate one</li>
            <li> It makes for a very close, nice smooth shave with VERY little irritation.</li>
            <li> It is true that my razor gets clogged, but it&#x27;s no big deal to keep it clean by swooshing it in my basin with water.    </li>
            <li> I have a very strong neck beard area, and normal shaving cream left it irritated and still hairy.</li>
            <li> This oil is especially useful for DE safety razor users who are traveling, as it eliminates the need to pack shave soap, shaving cream, badger brush, shave mug, and other safety razor accessories.</li>
            <li> This tiny bottle will last me a very long time, great product!</li>
            <li> Your face feels tingling fresh and vibrantly clearer.</li>
            <li> , I use a fusion and hydro 5, both clog up to the point I used an old toothbrush to clean them out.  </li>
            <li> Then wipe your legs clean with a soft, sturdy paper towel.</li>
            <li> 2nd off, it really does give you a better shave.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this because it seemed like it would be a really convenient way to have a quick and decent shave with my safety razor.  </li>
            <li> *was* a really convenient way to have a quick and decent shave with my safety razor.  </li>
            <li> This is much like a product that you can find overseas, mostly in the middle east.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ve probably already spent more time reading reviews for this product than is worth your time.</li>
            <li> I use a double edge safety razor, and have a pretty strong beard.  </li>
            <li> Figuring it was just a gimmick, I looked at the positive reviews on Amazon and decided to give it a try...    </li>
            <li> And, the result was still positive.  </li>
            <li> Quite frankly I don&#x27;t understand the positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> : you only need a few drops (literally) of this stuff for an amazing shave: just make sure to massage your face thoroughly before.</li>
            <li> But I tried it this morning for the first time and it really does work just as described.  </li>
            <li> The shaving oil doesn&#x27;t really lubricate that well - in fact, it&#x27;s pretty gummy and drags a bit and clogs your safety razor.</li>
            <li> I pretty much gave up on razor shaves years ago.  </li>
            <li> Having shaved with foam most of my life, it was strange not to load on foam at the start of the shave.  </li>
            <li> It lasts a long time, even though I use more than three drops.  </li>
            <li> First off, I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> I wet my face first with warm water, apply the oil and shave normally.</li>
            <li> is no better than soapy water, maybe not as good.</li>
            <li> oil has a bit of an odor, not bad sort of like an old time barber shop.  </li>
            <li> On a good note, the bottle was small</li>
            <li> works surprisingly well and in small amounts ..</li>
            <li> So I rinse in very hot running water after every swipe down my face, and that works most of the time.</li>
            <li> Use the oil as the instructions say, rinse the blade often with hot water and keep the skin wet, the skin is moist not dry as with any soap or creme, I can just rinse and good to go.</li>
            <li> This product is easy to use, works extremely well, provides an exceptionally close and comfortable shave and is very convenient to take on a trip because it is so small.  </li>
            <li> I bought this purely on the strength of all the positive reviews posted here.</li>
            <li> I bought it based on the large number of positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> After shaving with high quality electric razors for more years than I care to admit, I decided to switch to a double edge safety razor like my Dad used to use.  </li>
            <li> in the new world where carrying liquids through airport security is so much fun.  </li>
            <li> This stuff has given me the most smooth shave I&#x27;ve had in years, I mean completely irritation free.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty much replaced all the fancy shave soaps/badger brush nonsense with a much simpler solution.</li>
            <li> Aside from the cost adding up pretty fast, it does its job very well.</li>
            <li> A problem with this is that it can be easily misused, you need to rub the oil on your face, and latter your face with water also.</li>
            <li> I had my super sensitive skin husband try it.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin and</li>
            <li> It does gunk up the razor a bit, but it washes out easy enough.</li>
            <li> was on the sideburn part of my face, which is easy to pluck with tweezers, and none on the part of the face where the cheek/jawbone go from vertical to horizontal towards the neck which was always the big problem area.  </li>
            <li> - This was easy enough to do.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li> I think it smells pretty good, and goes on quick, and the person using it only needs a few drops per time shaving.</li>
            <li> now you&#x27;re left with a not-even-half shaven face smelling like strong chemical pine cones and you think &amp;</li>
            <li> use this with my electric wet/dry razor from Panasonic for pure shaving heaven.</li>
            <li> I use just 6 drops, and have a rather large face.</li>
            <li> but it certainly helps and smells nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It contained certain oils that made it do so.</li>
            <li> I will certainly buy it again.</li>
            <li> was interested in the idea that I don&#x27;t have to use messy shaving cream, and the easy clean up afterwards.</li>
            <li> Very impressed and sorry it took me so long to see the light.</li>
            <li> It was as if the hair was being pulled out of my face, and I was using a new razor right out of the package.  </li>
            <li> It works fine, but I will stick to a quality gel in the future.  </li>
            <li> This is an amazing little product.</li>
            <li> WOW - the stuff really works!!  </li>
            <li> I have a generally tough beard and could probably win a beard growing contest.  </li>
            <li> I first saw this product at Walmart, then saw the reviews on this site giving it high marks.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it makes such a huge difference when shaving</li>
            <li> Shave Secret works fantastic with safety razors, and works so amazingly well</li>
            <li> A friend suggested a popular, but more expensive pre-shave oil that is about $22-$25 per bottle.</li>
            <li> , if you do not like the smell of cloves this is a real put off.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I switch between an electric razor and multi blade razor (like a mach 3)depending on how much time I have to shave or my mood.  </li>
            <li> I can really feel the difference while shaving.</li>
            <li> I can see much difference, but rubbing my hand across my face yields a closeness I have not recalled since using a safety razor.  </li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t really what I was looking for.    </li>
            <li> This stuff really works.  </li>
            <li> , it really is a \\&quot;Shave</li>
            <li> My shave was close, smooth and left my skin feeling silky.</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t think he&#x27;d really like it,</li>
            <li> I bought this from Wal-Mart (much cheaper there)</li>
            <li> My skin is much happier now than when I was using shave soap and a brush.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Really great.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Using shaving cremes with a brush resulted in much closer shaves.  </li>
            <li> I use five drops a day on my wet face and then put Kiehl&#x27;s shave cream on top.  </li>
            <li> This product works really well.  </li>
            <li> The shave us so smooth and you only need 3 drops.</li>
            <li> Shave Secret works great.</li>
            <li> Shaving works really well.  </li>
            <li> Really works as advertised.  </li>
            <li> The oil really helps the balde glide over your face and cut the whiskers rather than dragging and hacking.  </li>
            <li> It has made shaving much easier and quicker.</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> I really wanted this to work.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have any issues with bumps</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.</li>
            <li> HOLY HIGH HEAVEN!  </li>
            <li> No bumbs, no irritation, and a very close shave.  </li>
            <li> For the past year I&#x27;ve been using a Braun Series 7 electric razor which has actually been pretty great except for the fact that it doesnt provide the closest shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the oil for about 3 weeks and really like it.  </li>
            <li> so much-</li>
            <li> the hair and oil would really gunk up a multi-bladed cartridge.  </li>
            <li> Shave Secret greatly reduces razor burn.  </li>
            <li> When you rub your hands over your scalp after shaving, it feels so extra smooth with no imperfections.</li>
            <li> Shave Secret is great.</li>
            <li> I have to use more than recommended drops and still get drag.</li>
            <li> I really like this shave oil.</li>
            <li> Proraso gives a much smoother shave with no oily or gummy feeling.  </li>
            <li> Very oily</li>
            <li> You may be able to get a &#x27;barbershop&#x27; wet shave line up from the comfort of your bathroom sink with no cream etc.</li>
            <li> been using it for years, really smoothes out shaving</li>
            <li> So when the directions said to use three drops I was very hesitant</li>
            <li> I really was thinking I wanted a pre shave oil to apply before my choice cream, but also</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have any critique for it.</li>
            <li> OTW, the modern shave creams are the way to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> This may work for &amp;#34;sink shavers&amp;#34; but not so much for me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think people with a lot of hair will like it because you really have to massage your face with it.</li>
            <li> There is no secret to it</li>
            <li> With shave secret it leaves the skin feeling great.</li>
            <li> In fact, I can&#x27;t discern much difference between using it and not using it.</li>
            <li> works very well .</li>
            <li> Gently rub them together</li>
            <li> Thanks to those of you who did list this info for those of us who need it.  </li>
            <li> Got this for my FIL as he is really into shaving.  </li>
            <li> This product seems targeted at people using a straight or double-edged razor.</li>
            <li> I use this oil to edge up with a straight edge razor.</li>
            <li> So it works very well as a shave oil and after shave.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I admit that I&#x27;ve tried to use it with a straight razor, but I don&#x27;t think it was meant to be used with a straight.  </li>
            <li> Then in the same place against the hair growth for a completely smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Eh, its alright, too much work to keep reapplying.</li>
            <li> Shaving oil is a fast and convenient shaving aid.</li>
            <li> You still don&#x27;t use much, but going off the instructions didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> and I really like it.  </li>
            <li> It was cheap enough, if it doesn&#x27;t work!  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel or seem like much</li>
            <li> It really does get you a close shave.</li>
            <li> and i am 50 but shave secret works great.</li>
            <li> The stuff really is legit.</li>
            <li> You need to gently tap the razor on the sink under flowing water.  </li>
            <li> What I don&#x27;t like about the oil is that it clogs the blades...doesn&#x27;t rinse out very well.  </li>
            <li> It adds a much needed warming feel to the oil.</li>
            <li> The plastic squeeze bottle makes dispensing the oil very easy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> VERY WELL..</li>
            <li> It really doesn&#x27;t work like the advertising claims.</li>
            <li> Shaves well, but has too much menthol for me.</li>
            <li> I even tried to apply 20 drops instead of 8 for shaving my head and it did not do much.</li>
            <li> Instead, my skin got very irritated from shaving.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t even try to use it as a pre-shave oil and put real lather over it.</li>
            <li> If I skip a day or 2, then it clogs up the razor too much</li>
            <li> the whole \\&quot;post-apocalypse\\&quot; setting?</li>

            <li> This product is no secret.</li>
            <li> NOT A SECRET ANYMORE . . . . .</li>
            <li> I much prefer these types of shaving oils to foamy lathers.</li>
            <li> The shave was much closer</li>
            <li> (Shave Secret is also a great moisturizer</li>
            <li> Really like it for blade shaving in the shower.  </li>
            <li> This is highly unusual for me.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really tell if it helps or not?</li>
            <li> It makes the areas I shave so much smoother and keeps me from getting razor burns and bumps.</li>
            <li> When I started straight razor shaving I tried every shave cream/soap/gel</li>
            <li> Using this oil will clog up a modern 3-5 blade razor within 4 strokes.</li>
            <li> Product as described; fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried a straight razor but it intrigues me.</li>
            <li> Get real.</li>
            <li> I use this with a Panasonic Arc3 class shaver (LT71), and it has really improved my shaving experience.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic would pinch once in a while prior to my using this, but now it&#x27;s just smooth.</li>
            <li> Neither one really worked that well.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t really tell any difference between the two.</li>
            <li> You are now ready to shave.  </li>
            <li> I really, really wanted this to work...</li>
            <li> It is a very compact size, so</li>
            <li> You absolutely won&#x27;t regret the savings or the closeness of the shave with this product.  </li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve always used shaving gels, creams, whatever, and they don&#x27;t work very well because I still end up with cuts and nicks and razor burn.</li>
            <li> This &#x27;snake oi&#x27;l is the real deal.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really like the smell BTW.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s in this stuff, and I probably don&#x27;t want to know, but it works very well.  </li>
            <li> An absolutely identical clone is made under the brand name Wilkinson Sword.</li>
            <li> But the feeling bothers me, so since it doesn&#x27;t seem to do much for me and bothers me a bit, I&#x27;m voting no on this one.</li>
            <li> I really like the shave I get with it.</li>
            <li> I had heard that pre-shave oil helps smooth things out, but I didn&#x27;t want to spend $25 on a tiny vial of designer stuff, so I tried olive oil before my shaving cream.</li>
            <li> I got the best results when I used a quality double edge razor (vintage gillette or mekur) and followed up the shave secret application with proraso sensistive shaving soap.  </li>
            <li> , smooth shaves against the grain that I could never do with a cream or gel, keeps my face soft with the natural oils.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell of the product is subtle and pleasant.</li>
            <li> My one complaint would be that the oil causes all of the hairs to accumulate and stick to the edge of your blade more than with shaving cream, thus requiring more frequent cleaning of the blade during shaving.</li>
            <li> But at least it can make you look good when you&#x27;re killing zombies.    </li>
            <li> I used it as a pre-shave oil, and would let it sit in warm water on my face for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> WOW!!!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a really dense beard, but being born with curly hair my whiskers are stiff, grow in all directions, and often don&#x27;t stand up like nice guys</li>
            <li> , maybe I have a big face - so it can go pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> I was surprised that it helped the razor glide right off the bat.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small size makes it great for travelers too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to thoroughly wet your face and hands with warm water before applying Shave Secret.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, I get satisfactory results with just water, although the oil is better for a really close shave.  </li>
            <li> Gives me a clean, close, and comfortable shave everyday.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, at first, but soon joined the ranks of the many reviewers who love this product.  </li>
            <li> I was extremely reluctant and became extremely pleased.  </li>
            <li> But just 3 drop of this stuff works better than any amount of any other shave oil, cream or gel that I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mind</li>
            <li> this amount (3 drops per shave) will outlast most of my other attempts at shaving foams/creams.</li>
            <li> I threw my other Walmart razors and foam in the garbage &#x3D;).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always looking for a better shaving cream, gel, razor and other miracle product.  </li>
            <li> , I assumed that it was just any essential oil that would do the trick, so I tried this other sample of essential oils that is supposed to help you focus or something to shave, and it wasn&#x27;t nearly as good!</li>
            <li> follwoing evaluation compares [[ASIN:B004ZBS4U8 Somersets Original English]], [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Better than any other product I have tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still a bigger fan of the aforementioned creams and soaps however, as I can more easily tell where I went over my face to reduce potential razor burn.</li>
            <li> But, I smartly purchased &amp;#34;Schick ST Disposable Razors with Aloe for Women, 12 Count Package&amp;#34; (only $6.88 as an Add-On Item), and was happy to find that they have this little tab you can push that helps clear the gunk away.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten better but the first few times I missed spots.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using shaving oils instead of cream for a long time, and this one is by far my favorite</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a small price to pay for such a great product.</li>
            <li> but if I was down to only 2 products to buy for shaving would be this oil and a good razor.</li>
            <li> Truth be told, my tallow shave soaps (such as Tabac) do a far superior job without Shave Secret and are much better than using this oil alone...</li>
            <li> I was thinking that the razor blades that came with my new kit were cheap and I have been butchering my face for the last 4 days.  </li>
            <li> With this you don&#x27;t need a big can of shaving cream, you don&#x27;t need badger brushes or special lotions.</li>
            <li> You never need to add more oil, but you may need a little water or to wet the razor more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll use the oil for as long as its available.</li>
            <li> I know that might sound strange</li>
            <li> Only downside (which I find to be the razors fault) is that the \\&quot;magic gel strip\\&quot; that is next to the blades wares out extremely fast by not using shave gel/cream -</li>
            <li> I have pretty sensitive skin and let me tell you..</li>
            <li> As I travel frequently, the ShaveSecret will be very convenient!</li>
            <li> It does contain a small amount of menthol which I rather liked.</li>
            <li> Takes a bit of getting used to - goes on as an oil, of course, and tends to clog the razor (you need to rinse frequently with hot water).  </li>
            <li> I usually shave in shower and it was a nice change to not having to shower to get a shave.</li>
            <li> post-shave face feels amazing, not dried out and tight.</li>
            <li> To put this in perspective, If I went more than 2 days without using my electric razor I would then have to use my hair clippers to shave it down</li>
            <li> Nothing more to say other than, BUY IT!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another large problem I have with Shave Secret is that I could not use the oil by itself and get a good shave out of it.</li>
            <li> I am a straight razor shaver and am always trying out new soaps and oils which will enhance the comfort of my shave.</li>
            <li> I can usually go many shaves without replacing razor, but once I used this product less than 5 times I had to toss my razor.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My Shave Gel works better and gives a cleaner shave with less iritation.</li>
            <li> and I find it is almost impossible to get a great shave without this oil!</li>
            <li> provide a decent shave&lt;br /&gt;Its</li>
            <li> The instructions said to use 3 to 5 drops, but I found that was enough to cover your upper lip at the most.</li>
            <li> rub my palm where ever I am going to shave mainly &amp;#34;counter&amp;#34; hair.&lt;br /&gt;Shave and rinse the blade</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been rocking a partial beard MOST of my freakin&#x27; adult life(by</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy or use this, unless you have a particular use or you&#x27;re Persian.  </li>
            <li> I have been using shave secret for a week, and so far I&#x27;m not all that happy with the results.</li>
            <li> It provides a smooth, close shave even for sensitive skin after multiple days of shaving in a row.</li>
            <li> and I get the clearest shave I have ever had, not to mention that it smells decent as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Try shaving with just 3 drops, and only add more the next time if feel it&#x27;s needed.  </li>
            <li> this runs out, I&#x27;ll try a similar product like American Crew, that (hopefully) has a better smell.  </li>
            <li> If you use the better soaps to begin with you have similar cost and a simpler experience with similar results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tried to use the product multiple times, and it just seems barely adequate at best.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it smells decent.</li>
            <li> As a collector of shaving razors and avid wet shaver I am always excited to try new products.</li>
            <li> I just know I had no razor skip, got a really close shave, and my skin was very soft after.</li>
            <li> the dry shave stick a little better as this seems to not run as smooth over the face.</li>
            <li> I even tried high dollar electric razors, nope, they will not work for me.    </li>
            <li> I will say though that the price on Amazon is quite high when you factor in the shipping.  </li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Having learned of the comfort of shaving with oil, I looked around and found coconut oil highly recommended.  </li>
            <li> I Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> For those that haven&#x27;t used an oil shaver before, I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> so I had high expectations.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend you try in.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what oils are used in the product, but I suspect that one of the oils may be mineral oil, which is highly viscous and becomes tacky when applied to my skin.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> High quality product.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend trying this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I use a Panasonic wet/dry shaver and have wet shaved with fine creams.</li>
            <li> An old toothbrush solves that problem rather quickly, and it isn&#x27;t enough to be that much of a hassle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My razor glides more easily than it does with regular shaving cream, and I get a shave that is at least as close</li>
            <li> well if you shave every single day and your facial hair is very fine</li>
            <li> In using this stuff with both types of razors, I got a better shave, and I think (but can&#x27;t objectivily prove) that my non-electric razor, lasted a little longer than usual.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it does take a little getting use to not being able to see where you shaved.</li>
            <li> Yes, your cartridge razor will need a little more cleaning out.</li>
            <li> I think it may shave a little better than shaving cream.</li>
            <li> A little bit better.</li>
            <li> However, all that being said, I think this would probably be ok for shaving your face since the skin is a little tougher.  </li>
            <li> A simple solution - an old toothbrush to clean blades.</li>
            <li> I just have to be a little more careful that I don&#x27;t miss any parts of my now amazingly smooth visage.</li>
            <li> I just have to be a little more careful that I don&#x27;t miss any parts of my now amazingly smooth visage.</li>
            <li> I think other guys on here are traditionalists and use safety razors and less modern blades; however I have been very pleased with the modern razor and SS.      </li>
            <li> Works great but smells weird.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have really sensitive skin and ussualy use a shave gel.</li>
            <li> I brought this product on a business trip and tested it on a four day old beard (I&#x27;m a yeti my hair grows so fast).</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive and very prone to irritation and razor burn.  </li>
            <li> WOW does it ever get you close with no irritation and fast too.  </li>
            <li> , very compact bottle for travel in a toiletries bag and the container is clear, so that you can tell when it&#x27;s almost gone, something that you can&#x27;t do w/ a metal can.</li>
            <li> As I pointed out, it became tacky on my skin, which caused razor drag and also meant that I wasn&#x27;t getting a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Too oily, it may seem to work because your skin naturally gets use to shaving and the bumps will no longer appear so this is really doing nothing.</li>
            <li> I use a double edge Merkur razor with Feather Stainless blades and Shave Secret does what it promises and it smells great, too.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what some people are doing wrong, but this works really great for me.</li>
            <li> I think you will be surprised how much difference three drops of oil can</li>
            <li> Any oil works better than this...don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I just ordered 2 more firmly brother in law.</li>
            <li> As a bonus, I seem to be able to use the razor long after the lubricant strip turns white.</li>
            <li> This products needs getting used to on two fronts if you normally have used shaving cream with a brush.</li>
            <li> still prefer my soap, brush, and mug for everyday use, but when I am even more pressed for time - or when I am on the road, this is now my GO-TO shaving substance.</li>
            <li> Then you just shave as you normally would.</li>
            <li> GUYS, if you&#x27;re corporate, or would just like to truly have that &#x27;fresh shaven&#x27; look 7 days a week, THIS IS IT.</li>
            <li> Been using the same bottle near daily for 6+ months, about to order more.  </li>
            <li> After a few weeks I noticed more acne than normal.</li>
            <li> After hearing several Shave Secret commercials on some of my favorite talk radio shows, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try - especially since it is SO much more economical than higher-priced shave oil.  </li>
            <li> Use Coconut oil instead, under normal shaving</li>
            <li> Your face will feel so much better not having been dried out</li>
            <li> but it does DEFINITELY have a distinct odor.</li>
            <li> But it always left my skin feeling really hot and sometimes really itchy.</li>
            <li> Be sure to spread it evenly and thoroughly to avoid missing a spot.</li>
            <li> Shave Secret surprisingly, works just as well as shaving cremes.</li>
            <li> Shave Secret is unbelievably good.</li>
            <li> Shave Secret turned out to be a good introduction to shaving with oil vs. foam or soap.  </li>
            <li> I got a good shave with the Shave Secret oil, but they claim it has a &amp;#34;hint of menthol&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> but I recommend a good tallow shave soap over Shave Secret.</li>
            <li> I have always suffered through ingrowns and shaving burns until Shave Secret combined with the Edwin Jagger DE89Lbl razor and Astra Superior Premium blades.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shave Secret is a good shaving oil, but I prefer King of Shaves to it.  </li>
            <li> Just to let the general public know, this product really works!!!</li>
            <li> since you really DO just use 3-4 drops, this thing&#x27;ll last a long time and is easy to carry with you on trips&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE:  </li>
            <li> Enough said, right.</li>
            <li> But I really don&#x27;t understand the overall positive reviews of the product.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Not only should everyone question this product and how over priced it is, but they should question all the so called positive reviews!</li>
            <li> perform a pre-shave (I use a double edge razor) ritual of hot moist towel to the face to get the skin and whiskers ready, for this product I did not then apply more water to my face just prior to using a brush and shave soap lather - with a damp face and wet hands</li>
            <li> ONLY use clippers and trimmers, and a screen shaver to clean up facial hair at the very end.</li>
            <li> You can shave sideburns straight as they are not hidden by shave cream.</li>
            <li> I travel internationally pretty regularly, so I am always looking for something simple, small, and good while on the road.</li>
            <li> The only thing that you may find irritating is that you so have to swish the razor in water more often while using this, fantastic for my legs but not so much for my razor.</li>
            <li> I used the oil on my final razor pass, without soap, and the oil caused more resistance than if I had dry shaved!</li>
            <li> so I can easily mow them down.</li>
            <li> I tried all types of the shaving cream and soap available in the market of USA and other country.</li>
            <li> Was hoping it would live up to the hype.  </li>
            <li> I am new to straigth shaving.</li>
            <li> It seems to live up well to its claims</li>
            <li> I used this product once and had to throw my brand new razor away because it had been all \\&quot;gunked\\&quot; up by the product</li>
            <li> (Yes, I used a new razor and rinsed it</li>
            <li> At any rate, I decided to try this new product as an addition to dermatologist recommended cleansers and treatments.  </li>
            <li> So I thought I would try something new.  </li>
            <li> and I think this might be my new shaving solution.</li>
            <li> No razor burn, no irritation, and all with a brand new shaving setup.</li>
            <li> I used three drops into the palm, rubbed the together per instructions and then to my face,  Could not get full face coverage with just that few drops is the first</li>
            <li> Same results, only twice again as smooth with NO irritation at all.   </li>
            <li> A nice bonus is I really like the smell of cloves that it leaves behind.</li>
            <li> and when I shaved the next day I noticed more drag.</li>
            <li> I started with one bottle of Shave Secret and liked it so much I bought the 8 pack about a year ago from the website.  </li>
            <li> The oil has a slight clove smell, but is not so strong that everyone smells it.  </li>
            <li> So far, my experience with Shave Secret Shaving Oil has been a good one.</li>
            <li> Ditch your million blade, vibrating, colorful plastic razor, buy a nice metal safety razor, and give Shave Secret a try!  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive sink</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Been shaving for a long, long time and this is the first shaving aid I have found that actually does make shaving better.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m already on my thrid purchase, and one little bottle last a very lone time, much better than any shaving cream I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I use a DE razor and Shave Secret, and the combo has been very effective for me over the last six months.</li>
            <li> Normally I will shave in the shower or after I get out so my skin will be moist and the hair soft.</li>
            <li> My recommendation is to 1) wet the face with warm (not hot) water, 2)</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> I first used this product for shaving in the field during The Basic School.</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I massaged 3 drops into my head, got my Mach3 razor out (the lube strip was already eroded on it), placed it up to my scalp, took a deep breath and gulp and made my first stroke.</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> This product was OK but not better than the Proraso pre-shave.</li>
            <li> But as far as having the smoothest shave of my life, this is it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why shaving cream exists when this is so much better.</li>
            <li> been using for 6 months and still have about 20% of the first bottle left.</li>
            <li> Much better just to apply a small amount of regular body lotion to shaving area followed by hot shaving foam.</li>
            <li> I also use a bit more than recommended even though I have a small face I&#x27;ll use maybe 7 drops.</li>
            <li> I only used two drops on my hair line and for the first time I didn&#x27;t carve myself up...</li>
            <li> my lovely and gracious wife gave me a shave kit that included a small bottle of shave oil.  </li>
            <li> I usually keep a Fusion Razor for more than a month.  </li>
            <li> The small bottle will also travel better than even the travel-sized aerosol shave</li>
            <li> has given - by far!</li>
            <li> and I tried it for the first time last night, with some skepticism.  </li>
            <li> Except the whiskers mysteriously disappear and I can see them as they are flushed out of the razor when I rinse it under the hot water faucet.</li>
            <li> Except the whiskers mysteriously disappear and I can see them as they are flushed out of the razor when I rinse it under the hot water faucet.</li>
            <li> After trying many different methods I came to the conclusion that it must be due to the collard shirts and tie that I am required to wear for my profession.</li>
            <li> In addition, it&#x27;s not unusual to go a full two weeks on a blade.</li>
            <li> One thing for sure, if I do try a new razor, it will be with conventional shave products not this funky oil in a tiny bottle.</li>
            <li> And that little bottle packs away so easily in your bugout bag</li>
            <li> The main problem was I had to attack my beard from different angles and go over it repeatedly to get a close shave all-around.  </li>
            <li> I get a better shave from this than expensive gels, and it&#x27;s cheaper and easier to clean up after as well.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need a large amount, so it lasts a long time despite its size &amp; it allows for a very close shave, both with &amp; against the grain of stubble.</li>
            <li> I love the smell, slightly spicy clove, but it&#x27;s light, not overwhelming and after drying off</li>
            <li> Nice scent (if you like clove spice) and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve got super thick hair which is literally capable of dulling even the sharpest razor on the first pass.</li>
            <li> I saw that this one was cheaper and gave it a try first due to the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> As a result I went back to dry shaving which continues to work fine.  </li>
            <li> My multiblade razor glides over the scalp with tremendous ease in both directions - with the grain and against the grain with no razor drag.</li>
            <li> A few drops and some hot water and your golden.</li>
            <li> And, in a pinch, you can use it to cut off that meat bag&#x27;s hand when it grabs you through the fence and tries to pull you in for a quick bite.</li>
            <li> It definitely cuts down on nicks and even let me run against the grain above my lip, which I&#x27;ve never been able to do in the past without a lot of digging and catching regardless of razor angle.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Shave cream&#x27;s are light and fluffy and there&#x27;s a reason for that: you want to lift the hairs and not dull the razor.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic for day to day shaving, no need to mess with a brush and soap.  </li>
            <li> This stuff might work ok for young faces, but not older wrinkled, dry faces like mine.</li>
            <li> Be forewarned, what other reviewers say about clogging the razor is true.</li>
            <li> Purchased another product recently (just to compare) and it works better and smells less.</li>
            <li> Well, go ahead, be skeptical because I&#x27;m telling you this is the best thing since sliced bread and black thread.</li>
            <li> I began using Shave Secret because it is great for travel -- a single bottle replaces shave gel and after shave.  </li>
            <li> I think if I were using a manual safety razor this product would be worth a closer look as it surely is easier and less messy compared to foams.</li>
            <li> my skin takes a beating, never get it close enough on certain parts of my face under my jaw, and I start breaking out within a day or two.  </li>
            <li> I got ingrown hairs,razor bumps cause my skin is very light sensitive and my hair is thick and curly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It significantly reduces skin irrational resulting in less breakouts.</li>
            <li> , I think that&#x27;s mostly because the razor is dull after</li>
            <li> These all develop a richer lather with better lubrication than any of the hard shaving soap bars, even glycerine.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Order a second one because it will replace your main shave cream/gel!</li>
            <li> I bought this because I&#x27;m a girl who has hirsutism (male pattern hair growth on a  woman), so I need a very, very close shave to feel normal and properly feminine.</li>
            <li> I was surprised, but this actually works really well.</li>
            <li> The product is clear, so as you apply it to your face, you can&#x27;t see it, nor can you feel it on your face.  </li>
            <li> My neck is sensitive, and always gets bloodied up.</li>
            <li> /&gt;As far as usefulness goes-</li>
            <li> With this oil and the electric shaver, that is completely gone.</li>
            <li> Wow</li>
            <li> just wow.....</li>
            <li> I will say that for the cost and how long I think it will last pretty much outweighs the smell.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m soft, not scaly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will recommend any pre-shave oil that is much thinner if you are using a double edged safety razor.</li>
            <li> You can also go directly to the \\&quot;shave secret\\&quot; factory site and get it in bulk (which I do).  </li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised how well this stuff works.      </li>
            <li> Use Neutrogena Sensitive skin after shave lotion (again, every day...don&#x27;t stop using it just because you used it once).  </li>
            <li> You will be surprised by this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been testing different ways of getting a really close shave.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband who has sensitive skin and prone to ingrown hairs and razor burn on his neck underneath his chin.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and a roommate</li>
            <li> and WOW all that I can say</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much easier now for me to get symmetry and line up my facial hair.</li>
            <li> I have to use an old toothbrush to dislodge the residue between successive strokes.</li>
            <li> With a safety razor, there&#x27;s no need to rinse at all until you&#x27;ve finished your shave unless you haven&#x27;t shaved in a couple weeks, but a cartridge razor would get clogged and need to be rinsed frequently.</li>
            <li> A guy can&#x27;t get any action when he&#x27;s all nicked up, with hair bumps and all rashy looking....</li>
            <li> have sensitive skin, and this product has never been an issue.</li>
            <li> Another perk is that this is all natural oils rather than a bunch of chemicals.</li>
            <li> I have a sensitive neck area.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Pleasantly surprised that this works as well as it does.</li>
            <li> I did have to adjust how often I rinse my blade, since the tiny spacing between modern blades makes it clog faster.  </li>
            <li> My thoughts are old guy smell</li>
            <li> If you are a guy who only wants it for your face, 5 star rating.</li>
            <li> and I have an extremely sensitive neck,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve shaved with it three times so far.  </li>
            <li> No messy foam and dryness of the skin.</li>
            <li> I have tried nearly every cream, soap, lotion, razor, and shaving technique...</li>
            <li> use it with: Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood Shaving Cream Bowl, 5.3-Ounce&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Pacific All Natural ([[ASIN:B000FNEWL0 Pacific Shaving Company Natural Women]]</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> I agree with most of the negative comments.  </li>
            <li> My husband has sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin on my face/neck and have not had any irritation using this.</li>
            <li> See how far it gets you.  </li>
            <li> About as far as this will.  </li>
            <li> Though I do have really sensitive skin, so it may work for you.  </li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin, give this product a try.  </li>
            <li> Works very well, I especially like it when I&#x27;m in a hurry.</li>
            <li> I also like the fact that the oil is not heavily scented.</li>
            <li> NOT MESSY</li>
            <li> But... after learning (yes, I can still learn in my old age), that I should be shaving my chin and neck instead of plucking at it</li>
            <li> It is not messy and does leave my skin feeling soothed after a shave with an electric razor.</li>
            <li> yet you only need a drop or two for your whole face</li>
            <li> It really DOES give me a closer shave that does seem to last longer.</li>
            <li> It has completely revolutionized my shaving experience.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 61 years old, started shaving when I was 16.</li>
            <li> I use the grooming lounge shave oil but decided to try this for travel,  wow,  </li>
            <li> All I can say is wow.</li>
            <li> Moisturized and soft...</li>
            <li> Comes in a tiny bottle, but you&#x27;re not supposed to use much product.  </li>
            <li> I frequently nick myself and end up with razor burn.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;-I have always frequently rinsed my razor.  </li>
            <li> I feel like I was completely ripped off.</li>
            <li> For years I looked for a nonalcohol natural mousturizing after shave.</li>
            <li> If everything locks up in another six months I&#x27;ll update my review, but so far so good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I sometimes use an old toothbrush to declog.</li>
            <li> I think you will be pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> Would like to use something natural to shave, but this is just not working.</li>
            <li> Then I apply Taylor of Old Bond Street Lavender shave</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft and refreshed.</li>
            <li> Followed all the instructions and it made the non trouble spots baby smooth.  </li>
            <li> Wow.  </li>
            <li> I have eczema, and I had been purchasing the \\&quot;sensitive skin\\</li>
            <li> Having come this far on my shaving journey, I thought, &amp;</li>
            <li> like they did when I was five years old, like the proverbial baby&#x27;s butt.</li>
            <li> Having come this far on my shaving journey, I thought, &amp;</li>
            <li> like they did when I was five years old, like the proverbial baby&#x27;s butt.</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive, and my chin is pointy and dimpled, and shaving is a pain.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ve been getting more conservative haircuts lately, and I wanted a conservative shave to go with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m completely sold.</li>
            <li> That this product is quickly absorbed and requires only a few drops, made it worth trying for me.    </li>
            <li> /&gt;Definitely try this before you try a more expensive brand, it will be worth it.</li>
            <li> A few more if necessary.</li>
            <li> I have spent so much money over the years trying to find a natural shaving cream/gel/oil that works as promised, and this is definitely one of the few I&#x27;ve found to be effective (ZIRH Pre-Shave Oil and Shave Gel are the others).</li>
            <li> I have seen many gimmicks out there but Shave Secret is the real deal.</li>
            <li> Take one drop of Shave Secret with warm water and rub it on the area after every shower.  </li>
            <li> I cannot say enough good things about Shave Secret.</li>
            <li> That was this morning and for the rest of the day I would rub my hand across my smooth bald head and smile at the secret I had just discovered.</li>
            <li> Shave Secret helps reduce irritation by providing a nice oil buffer between hair and blade.</li>
            <li> but the shave I got is one of the best, closest, least irritating I may have ever had.  </li>
            <li> Putting this oil on your face creates a thick layer of oil and putting shaving cream on top doesn&#x27;t do anything.</li>
            <li> It took a little work to figure out how to edit my original review of this product from years ago.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easier than trying to pack shave cream, and, because it&#x27;s so small, it fits easily into a quart bag for ease at airport security check points.</li>
            <li> I used 2 drops at first, put in the palm of my DRY hand, spread around and applied to face.</li>
            <li> First off, I am in the U.S. NAVY and space aboard a ship is limited.</li>
            <li> Seriously, Shave Secret is the best.</li>
            <li> No nicks either, and no mess associated with the brush and soap.</li>
            <li> The bottle is very small, you get many shaves out of it</li>
            <li> Close shave, no irritation or dryness, no mess to rinse off when your done.  </li>
            <li> Some recommend olive oil to give a barrier of the skin to prevent cuts, shave secret takes that barrier and adds a clove sent, it that allows the blatant smoothly transit ones face easy and safely.</li>
            <li> I am now shaving with coconut oil and like it much better, and my wife loves the subtle fragrance.</li>
            <li> The idea that you have to buy the latest 17 blade contraption is ridiculous to me.  </li>
            <li> For me it doesn&#x27;t lubricate enough initially and does not re-wet after first pass.</li>
            <li> Ok, I must admit that I was a bit skeptical of this product at first.  </li>
            <li> I use 5-7 drops of this as described in the instructions, but then I add a thin layer of normal shaving cream on top.</li>
            <li> Thankfully, it was the total opposite when I first used it.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first that I would not be able to use this as a shaving agent by itself for my corse face hair</li>
            <li> The smell was decent enough, not what I&#x27;d use for a cologne, but not overpowering, either.</li>
            <li> I have used a full bottle in a little over a.</li>
            <li> I had such high hopes for this product.</li>
            <li> Read the various postings to help you decide but believe me, shaving oil is a definite positive addition to your shave.  </li>
            <li> No more razor burns and my skin feels really smooth.</li>
            <li> It works very well, so long as you keep rinsing your blade out (which you should do anyway).  </li>
            <li> This is the first time that I&#x27;ve used an electric razor wet for shaving.</li>
            <li> I just get it wet with hot water.&lt;br /&gt;Shave as usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> First time using it followed the directions, 5 drops in a wet hand an massage it in and shave.</li>
            <li> I always wet my head and face first and then add 4 to 6 drops even though the directions say 3 to 4.</li>
            <li> I shave with an electric, and normally would only shave ever week</li>
            <li> Shave Secret has made shaving a lot better for me, a guy with sensitive skin who gets razor bumps frequently.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a dermatologist, but I stopped using this product and went back to normal.</li>
            <li> Not only did I get a close shave (following the instructions and tips for use on the back of the package), but the oil was easier to clean up after shaving, and left my skin feeling like I had put a balm on it... not greasy -</li>
            <li> I was a little disconcerted by the clumping of the hair in the blades, but just one or two  quick shakes in my rinse basin</li>
            <li> Husband at first found it confusing because he expected it to foam up, but once he discovered how little is used each time, he decided his face felt uniquely good.  </li>
            <li> I did not like was that my new razor clogged so much faster than with any other gel or cream.</li>
            <li> He has folliculitis and very curly hair, and even after some prescriptions and plenty of other products, this is his favorite and gives him the closest shave with the least ingrown hairs after.</li>
            <li> My next test is to shave with a not-brand new blade.  </li>
            <li> My face was irritated,  I tried using yet another razor from a different new package I had, and no difference.  </li>
            <li> in that the razor did not go over the skin very well (versus a dry shave without using anything).  </li>
            <li> Additionally, I found I needed to make sure the face remained quite wet because as it dried it became \\&quot;sticky\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Maybe I just have sensitive skin, but this doesn&#x27;t give me anywhere near enough lubrication for a shave.  </li>
            <li> Leaves skin feeling smooth and soft for at least 4 hours.  </li>
            <li> I saw this while at Walmart, where you can score this for about half the price as it is hers, and figured it was worth a try.</li>
            <li> Having facial hair is something I&#x27;ve dealt with since puberty and this is the only thing that really keeps my skin from getting cut up.</li>
            <li> product, soft and smooth, at least that&#x27;s what i was told.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had problems with shaving because I have such sensitive skin, and using an electric razor (Panasonic ES8103S Pro-Curve Wet/Dry Rechargeable Linear Pivot Action Shaving System, Silver).</li>
            <li> Aside from that i got very sensitive skin not only in my beard area.</li>
            <li> I usually follow with bump patrol (original formula) and then spf 30 face cream.     </li>
            <li> And I got a major razor rash after  trying this out.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do notice a major difference when I don&#x27;t use the oil.  </li>
            <li> Major benefit</li>
            <li> This is a major plus and why I will continue using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I loved it, but was very disappointed to find it was well over $25 dollars to order more when the tiny sample bottle ran out.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally, I&#x27;m convinced I get a better shave with less irritation, and it takes less time.</li>
            <li> I have sensative skin and tough beard this oil made shaving painless and smooth!</li>
            <li> This also works amazing on every, and I do mean every other area.</li>
            <li> It was a little unusual at first, as you use only 3-4 drops of the product mixed with a bit of water.  </li>
            <li> generally shave every day, but after using this, the shave was so close</li>
            <li> I was afraid that this tiny, much cheaper option wouldn&#x27;t just be as good, but I&#x27;m glad I was wrong</li>
            <li> maintain a french cut beard and I was looking for a clear shave solution so that I can shape my beard...</li>
            <li> According to the manufacturer&#x27;s website, if you experience razor drag add more water, not more product.</li>
            <li> ALso...to get the minor clogging in your razor out, buy a cheap toothbrush give it a few wipes at the end of each shave....</li>
            <li> I could make multiple passes without irritation, ending up with soft, baby-smooth skin.</li>
            <li> Also, the 5 drops as sdvertised is no where near enough.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shaving foams are mainly soap-based which dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product, especially if you have a sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The thing is that 3 drops will barely cover 1 side so I use 10-15 drops for face and neck.  </li>
            <li> I can still get nicks and bumps if I&#x27;m not careful</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m barely about to run out</li>
            <li> Because of how sensitive my skin has always been, I&#x27;d only shave twice a week.  </li>
            <li> Never really thought about shaving as much before.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was out to look for a shaving option that provided a close shave and did not empty</li>
            <li> There is no rinsing required after your shave, simply wipe your face with a soft washcloth and let the oils stay and soak into your skin</li>
            <li> will say I was pleasantly surprised that my skin  was not irritated, nor did it break out later.</li>
            <li> I remember seeing my Dad&#x27;s whiskers and unshaven beard after a week of canadian fishing and thinking \\&quot;Wow that looks like white sandpaper on his face!\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> : barely perceptible.  </li>
            <li> Last week I ran out again and thought I would try to use up some of my old shaving cream and shaving gels before I reordered again from Shavesecret.  </li>
            <li> I have a coarse beard and sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> but I had some cuts and nics near my upper lip.</li>
            <li> I think you will be pleasantly surprised., but it is definitely not a scent that anyone would mistake for a cologne.  </li>
            <li> but I am never going back to the old way.</li>
            <li> Ok not great.</li>
            <li> But I can shave with Shave Secret and get an even better, as well as quicker, shave.</li>
            <li> , You have to use much more than 3 drops and the consistency is just too thick (especially for double edged shaves).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The secret of course is to use plenty of water at the start and re-wet as needed, not add more oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather use shaving cream; it comes out of the can as a foam; no need to add more water or keep pushing it around your face unlike shave secret.</li>
            <li> If you have thick, fast-growing, blade-resistant beard hair, this oil alone will not give you a comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> spread Shave Secret on your face, and then use a shaving cream on top of it (I like Proraso).</li>
            <li> I have tried many products, but now I&#x27;m sold on shave secret.</li>
            <li> I came across Shave Secret and could not believe that a $5 product could compete with pre-shave oils that cost $30 or more.</li>
            <li> Well, OK, I can think of some things that would be worse, but picky legs still makes the list.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s really a secret though, if it were I wouldn&#x27;t have been able to buy it.</li>
            <li> I inherited a fast growing coarse beard that just gets more difficult to shave as I age.  </li>
            <li> I love shave secret oil.</li>
            <li> At that point I heard about Shave Secret Shaving Oil and :I was also at the point of needing to order more Harry&#x27;s blades.</li>
            <li> At that point I heard about Shave Secret Shaving Oil and :I was also at the point of needing to order more Harry&#x27;s blades.</li>
            <li> So toss that crap and get yourself a good, quality straight razor!</li>
            <li> and i would say it irritates a little less than most of the shaving gels</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s really not that strong at all and after a little while it goes away.</li>
            <li> Once I felt the razor glide the first time down my face with no drag, I was speechless.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, put me down as a skeptic-to-SSSO fan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: After a few weeks of using SSSO, a couple more observations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , this Shave Secret allows me to cut right through it all on the first pass</li>
            <li> I cannot believe a few drops of oil will keep a real razor from killing my face and offer a very professional close shave.  </li>
            <li> With a single application you can shave at least twice just by putting more water on the shaving area.</li>
            <li> I even tried wet shaving for a bit with limited success.</li>
            <li> First of all, I&#x27;m a black guy.</li>
            <li> Also, considering I was paying $18 per bottle for my previous shaving cream, this is an absolute steal!  </li>
            <li> I am not sure where the other find the smell is &amp;#34;mild&amp;#34; or ok or that it goes away.</li>
            <li> My husband has to shave daily for his job and it gets painful, so I was so happy when he told me this works</li>
            <li> cheap enough to at least try out for those still experimenting</li>
            <li> When I tried \\&quot;The Total Shaving Solution\\&quot;, it worked much better compared to Shave Secret.  </li>
            <li> Since Amazon doesn&#x27;t sell Shave Secret with Prime shipping, I found I can get a better deal locally than I can online, but your mileage may vary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> Like so many others, I was introduced to Shave Secret in a race swag bag a couple of years back.  </li>
            <li> I loved the idea of carrying such a teeny tiny little bottle in my Dopp kit, but this stuff is No Good.</li>
            <li> tried to shave and found it a major irritation, I finally figured at that point the product was not going to work.  </li>
            <li> First off, I buy this stuff at walmart for a little over $2.</li>
            <li> Would prefer scentless and not sure how much better it is than other shave oils, but it definitely gets the job done.</li>
            <li> the flip side of that small negative, you can safely run your hand over your face to feel for those spots that have yet to reach the classic BBS state without smearing lather off.  </li>
            <li> The mileage I get from this little bottle is unreal as I bet it last 6 to 9 months or more with me using it everyday.</li>
            <li> product is exactly what is says it is, no more, no less.</li>
            <li> only reason to use this product is if it reminds you of your trip to Petra, you need something super small for your travel bag, or you want to smell like cloves.  </li>
            <li> Even though the instructions say to only use three drops I generally use five, and then put shaving cream over that</li>
            <li> I like the way it travels too, small enough to fit just about anywhere and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> The small size of this product alone makes the purchase worth it.</li>
            <li> Shave secret shaving oil (purchased from local Walmart) is undoubtedly better than the standard shaving gel or cream.</li>
            <li> By running water over the blade often, I never experienced it becoming clogged/</li>
            <li> Good face prep, especially hydrating your skin and beard,is the key, as is a sharp blade, but Shave Secret is the critical next step.  </li>
            <li> It allows the longer hairs to clog the razor easily and they are tough to rinse out.</li>
            <li> I have really coarse facial hair and just started going old school and bought a twist to open safety razor last week from here.      </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually not sure if I even used it right.</li>
            <li> Its true it does not smell like vicks, but it does have a bad cheap cologne fragrance that lingers.</li>
            <li> Just wanted to say, this very product and size can be had from Wally World for half the price!&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> I much prefer this product to typical shaving creams in a can.</li>
            <li> I have ultra sensitive skin and shaving makes my face &amp; neck feel irritated and dry.  </li>
            <li> BUT, I have found almost any oil will work just as well (perhaps with more than a few drops but not much more).  </li>
            <li> My face was wet with hot water and I put four drops in my wet palms.</li>
            <li> /&gt;As a long time wet shaver and straight razor user</li>
            <li> After warming the oil in hot tap water, it was still far too thick after applying it to my face.</li>
            <li> It is marginally better than plain baby oil, and it occupies little space in your toilet kit.</li>
            <li> I suspect it&#x27;s because of the heavy marketing supporting the various foams and gels from the big name brands.  </li>
            <li> I suspect it&#x27;s because of the heavy marketing supporting the various foams and gels from the big name brands.  </li>
            <li> When I ran out of the spray, I went to the local shopping center to get a new can.  </li>
            <li> And the shave is a little less comfortable than shaving with a traditional shave soap (Not the canned stuff.</li>
            <li> A &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; if you suffer from dry, sensitive skin and an essential for newie westshavers.</li>
            <li> Downsides are that it is not easy to see where you have shaved, and you must rinse the razor frequently in hot water or the oil and hair mixture turn into a solid that blocks the razor.</li>
            <li> It actually pushes the top blade down so that the hair, oil, shaving cream, etc... is forced out from between the blades.</li>
            <li> I definitely notice that razor burn occurs far less frequently.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had shavers foliculitus for a few years now and this certainly helped.</li>
            <li> I have a fairly heavy beard and while I have a beard and have less real estate to groom, it is  nevertheless one of my least favorite rituals.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have much of an odor, maybe a little woody</li>
            <li> It has a distinct smell that is really hard to wash off.  </li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t really eliminate my getting a rash near my delicate area...</li>
            <li> About the size of a bottle of eye drops, Shave Secret is a compact, lightweight and economical alternative to toting around a big old metal can of traditional shaving cream in a toiletry bag.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use as a base layer for shaving and so far so good.</li>
            <li> I have bought a bottle to use for my new Panasonic es 8103 s wet and dry rechargeable razor.</li>
            <li> As far as electric shavers go, the shave was extremely close.  </li>
            <li> Another advantage is that because you only use several drops for each shave, the tiny bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Second, I was used to knowing where I&#x27;d shaved by the absence of the shaving cream I had removed.</li>
            <li> Instead they like to lie flat and try to avoid the approaching razor&#x27;s edge.</li>
            <li> I usually have to moisturize my face immediately after shaving but with Shave Secret, my face felt soft and moisturized, nourished and healthy.</li>
            <li> He had one complaint about it though - the menthol smell is a little strong if you&#x27;re using the product on the face - but the smell doesn&#x27;t last long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Amazon&#x27;s price is a little high, but hey, it is delivered to your door.</li>
            <li> If I begin feeling a little drag on the razor, I add a little more water to my face and the drag just disappears.  </li>
            <li> TSS product has a much better scent, not that this one is unpleasant, but in a direct comparison, I&#x27;d prefer TSS.  </li>
            <li> I will use what is left to dribble onto my shave soap each time I use it, at least it will have some purpose and not just be thrown away which was my first thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save</li>
            <li> Note some of the other comments, you have to push hard on the razor to get a clean shave</li>
            <li> Definitely provides a closer, less irritating shave than most creams.  </li>
            <li> and I usually leave several bleeding knicks on my face from applying too much pressure.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long as I would expect when using only 4 drops at a time, though.</li>
            <li> /&gt;2-3 drops is plenty, so this tiny bottle will last a long time.  </li>
            <li> I tried this and the first shave was good, but the shaves after that were terrible.  </li>
            <li> i must have had high expectations because i find it very very average.</li>
            <li> just so the facial hairs were long enough, and straight enough(not curled back into pores - or at least broken back through the surface of the skin) to get a clean looking shave/haircut.&lt;br /&gt;NOT</li>
            <li> First a little background, I shave in the shower by feel every other day with a Gillette disposable razor.</li>
            <li> You try to spread it evenly on your areas to shave, but in practice it&#x27;s pretty hard to tell if you have everything covered.&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li> My face feels wet and soft instead of dry and parched.</li>
            <li> I bought my shave secret at Wal-mart, I think the cost was less too, but I&#x27;m glad to see it here too.</li>
            <li> It took me 5-6 years of regular shaving to find this regimin, but I highly recommend the above combination to anyone who does not currently love their shaving experience.</li>
            <li> I usually lather up real well</li>
            <li> I have tried MANY, in a desperate attempt to reduce razor rash, bumps AND get the closest shave possible to last all day.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> II haven&#x27;t used this product long enough to have an opinion</li>
            <li> A bottle will last you a long time.  </li>
            <li> Not nearly lubricated enough.</li>
            <li> It last a long time even though I use twice the recommended amount.</li>
            <li> 2 days later, I tried it again, only this time with a wet face, 4-5 drops total and re-wetting the electric razor.  </li>
            <li> Personally, I don&#x27;t care for the smell, but it&#x27;s a minor issue that doesn&#x27;t affect its functionality.</li>
            <li> Barely feels like my face is wet, and I get cuts and razor burns aplenty.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t you waited long enough to do this already?)</li>
            <li> So , it wont last as long as I expect , but I will keep on buying it .</li>
            <li> And it does last a long time, making the price a bit easier.</li>
            <li> I like the cool oil cooling sensation it leaves behind after shaving.</li>
            <li> Smells like pine cones and some weird chemical mixed together, and I don&#x27;t mean that in a good way.</li>
            <li> The oil contains is tiny, but it lasts a very very long time, almost as long as a regular can of shaving cream.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to see the little bottle, but what a BIG impact it had.</li>
            <li> I shave everyday using a Braun Series 7 (top model) electric razor - this unit for the past 2 yrs; previously used another Braun model.  </li>
            <li> The reason for four stars - Shave Secret is a little thinner than the $25 shave oil, which requires using a couple more drops.  </li>
            <li> Sadly, with Shave Secret there is no satisfying lathery foam, and there seems to be only one scent (sort of cinnamon and spicy), but it does the best job of any shaving lotion/gel/foam I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t overpowering since I use so little, and at this rate I expect the bottle to last another six months, if not a little longer.  </li>
            <li> was going to stop DE shaving my neck and go back to multi blades due to constant red bumps and burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The last part of my face shaved is typically dry when I get to shaving it.  </li>
            <li> One of the oils this shave oil includes is clove oil which is a natural, slight numbing agent.  </li>
            <li> I would have never bought this because of their dumb packaging, but I got a free sample with some other purchase and gave it a try.</li>
            <li> Why did I think that &amp;#34;3-5 drops&amp;#34; of essentially baby oil with cloves would &amp;#34;Dramatically reduce dry skin, rashes, nicks, cuts, ingrown hairs and shaving bumps&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;provide</li>
            <li> When I&#x27;m done shaving I simply towel my face dry</li>
            <li> Actually feels as if I am dragging a razor over a dry face.</li>
            <li> Often times I don&#x27;t have time to get a proper wet shave in with my cream, brush, and safety razor, so I&#x27;m reduced to using commercial shave gels and cartridge razors.</li>
            <li> I have spent alot of money on various electric razors, shave creams and foams and various brands of razors and blades.  </li>
            <li> Shave Secret leaves your face soft and has a refreshing,  subtle aroma.</li>
            <li> I went back to electric, bought Shave Secret (it claims to be useful with as a pre-electric).  </li>
            <li> Based on how inexpensive this product is, if you have sensitive skin and have tried an failed everything else like me, it is worth a try.</li>
            <li> Especially if you are shaving your chest, use a fresh blade and Shave Secret</li>
            <li> Wet your face with water, place a few drops of oil on your palm, and massage gently.  </li>
            <li> But when I want to get somewhere quick and need a shave, I use Shave Secret.  </li>
            <li> use a Fusion razor, so I do benefit from multiple blades and the lubricating strip (which I suspect is of limited value).</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re not likely to go back to other shaving systems or creams.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you use it on your head, wet it first, then use 9-10 drops; any less ruins</li>
            <li> Shave Secret makes shaving easy, and it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin all red or dried out.</li>
            <li> Nothing miraculous, but certainly makes less of a mess than shaving foam or gel.</li>
            <li> Very dry, 4 drops is not enough.</li>
            <li> it completely replaces shaving cream and the little bottle lasts for months</li>
            <li> Its lasting really long especially since I shave every other day.</li>
            <li> So I ran a half marathon a few months back, and they had this tiny sample of shave secret in a bag of mostly advertisements/coupons.</li>
            <li> It has reduced my nicks from the safety razor down to a very bare minimum.  </li>
            <li> You have to use a little more than they recommend, and it is expensive, which is the only reason I gave 4 instead of 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I have a tough facial hair growth and it really makes short work of removing it.</li>
            <li> Crazy as it sounds the drop of oil makes the soap lather better.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It was different having to keep my face wet and rinse</li>
            <li> You know constant trimmer activity on the skin can be rough.</li>
            <li> As a result, I will continue using it as long as it is made.</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t take long to get used to.  </li>
            <li> Works well and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> Life long customer.</li>
            <li> Actually, I suspect running your wet hand over your face helps the process by keeping your skin damp as per instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Why did it take me so long to find this stuff?</li>
            <li> A long time user of store bought razors with 2, 3 5, 6 razors with shave foam.  </li>

            <li> I have made a long journey on my way to using shaving oil (See my review of [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shave Secret does not work better than shaving cream, in fact it&#x27;s far worse.</li>
            <li> I tried Shave Secret for the first time last week.</li>
            <li> I saw Shave Secret in Walmart and thought it might be worth a try.    </li>
            <li> /&gt;Compared to Anthony Logistics and the Art of Shaving Unscented Pre-shave oil, Shave secret wins buy a mile.  </li>
            <li> I followed the directions for half my head &amp; used shaving cream on the other side and a new blade.</li>
            <li> And my facial hair had only had half a day to grow!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (I mean, how much closer can I shave?).</li>
            <li> shaving regime was once a week due to sensitive skin of bumps and lots of bleeding bubbles a few days later if I shaved twice a week.  </li>
            <li> Also, I ended up having to re-shave using plain old shaving cream.</li>
            <li> I can tell many of the unhappy users are applying to a dry face with dry hands.</li>
            <li> It is a little too thick and a little too strongly scented for my tastes.</li>
            <li> The price is inexpensive for how long this product will last you (only a few drops needed)and</li>
            <li> I might not have been so scruffy for so long!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve NEVER gone back to any other shaving cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other similar preparations ( shavingsauce.com ) premium shaving oil that works as well without the greasy after feeling.</li>
            <li> Do what&#x27;s been proven to work: (1) spend at least 3 minutes prepping your face by applying warm (not hot) water to your cheeks and gently massage, (2) apply a lathery shaving cream (preferably not the ones in metal cans--just invest in a proper shaving CREAM and lather it up yourself with a badger brush geez.</li>
            <li> Shaving has been taken to a whole new level and my wallet is a little fatter because of Shave Secret.  </li>
            <li> Only a few drops are needed with each use and will last a very long time.</li>

            <li> You need to rinse the razor after each stroke or it will clog and be difficult to clean.  </li>

            <li> The packaging looks very gimmicky but if all I was losing was a few dollars I was willing to take the risk.</li>
            <li> I mean, we&#x27;re talking an average of three drops for your whole face! :</li>
            <li> Single drops of oil are dispensed by squeezing the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Bottle I smaller than other pre-shave oils I have used, but I find I need less of this to get the same coverage.</li>
            <li> On two occasions, I was going out in the evening, and where I usually would not shave because of razor burn etc from frequently shaving.</li>
            <li> Still don&#x27;t understand how 3 drops of this oil can go such a long way in one shave compared to regular shaving gels or creams that I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> However, on my neck which is the area of greater challenge to an electric, I found that Shave Secret actually made the problem worse.  </li>
            <li> I did too the first time and received poor results.  </li>
            <li> I, too, found my first Shave Secret at Wal-Mart and almost passed it up because it looked like one of those \\&quot;info commercial\\&quot; products.  </li>
            <li> Even after sweating, when most after shaves have worn off, Shave Secret stops the salt in your sweat from irritating your skin, especially in the throat area.  </li>
            <li> My shaving ritual - rinse head &amp; face with hot water, apply shave secret, barbasol.  </li>
            <li> I still have the can of Edge Gel that was in my shower when I first used the Shave Secret.  </li>
            <li> I dug out my banished Feather razor, put in a new Astra blade, and have used it with Shave Secret for the last three or four weeks, shaving daily or every other day.</li>
            <li> I dug out my banished Feather razor, put in a new Astra blade, and have used it with Shave Secret for the last three or four weeks, shaving daily or every other day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been tweezing my facial hair and have the scars to prove how irritating this part of the transition to older womanhood has been.</li>
            <li> Bottom line - the little bottle won&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> I typically use double the recommended 4-5 drops, but it still seems like a bargain.</li>
            <li> American Crew, etc which may be a bit less cost per oz</li>
            <li> Yesterday I saw it for Half of what I paid  for at my local HEB ..Store in Austin Texas .. !</li>
            <li> I actually tossed the bottle after using it for a week and a half.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about 1 week, so I&#x27;m curious to see how long that little bottle will last.</li>
            <li> When an area gets a little dry, you simply slap some water on it, and keep going.  </li>
            <li> I have very dry skin because of thryoid issues that are just getting corrected.  </li>
            <li> , you can see what you&#x27;re doing instead of just seeing foam, and you don&#x27;t have to reapply if you take too long on one side and the other dries out,</li>
            <li> It literally only takes a few drops as long as you keep things wet.</li>
            <li> After recently purchasing a new wet/dry electric, I opted to test our Shave Secret.  </li>
            <li> stuff lasts for a VERY long time, as you only need a few drops.</li>
            <li> The only cuts I got were over previous razor bumps I had which was expected.</li>
            <li> that I use shave secret, I would get really nice, close shaves with a mediocre shaver (3-blade) and would have very minor cuts if any.  </li>
            <li> as such, I will give this product another try this week but hold out little hope for it.</li>
            <li> Nothing worked, until this little generic looking \\&quot;I made this in my garage in the 1950&#x27;s\\&quot; bottle of \\&quot;shave secret\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Hard to wash off, feels like old oil from a frying pan.</li>
            <li> biggest problem is that unless I shower my facial hair is coarse and hard to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is just a bad product, much better to use just olive oil.</li>
            <li> Works great for BOTH hand razors and electric, give it a try and you won&#x27;t be disappointed!!!    </li>
            <li> /&gt;It may look crazy to replace a big can of shaving cream with a tiny bottle of oil, but it really works.  </li>
            <li> I have been wet shaving for about 14 months.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;Tends to waterproof - wet shavers need to be careful</li>
            <li> I recently let me hair grow back, but I continue to use the Secret on my face, and I&#x27;m about to order my third bottle.</li>
            <li> People who have had problems with gunking up the razor or poor performance, I suspect used too much oil -</li>
            <li> Sometimes a few days later I would get the bumps, but I found that doing one of two things would prevent them:  </li>
            <li> Shave Secret was a real surprise.</li>
            <li> The point is that Shave Secret gives you a very close shave</li>
            <li> I use the 5 drops on a wet face and shave with a Fusion.</li>
            <li> There is still a bit of razor drag that i don&#x27;t get with a drag.  </li>
            <li> no matter how careful I am.</li>
            <li> No need for preperation before hand and no need for post shave balm, I used to get the old boar brush out and use shave soap and use my trusty double edge safety razor, well now I use just my double edge safety razor and Shave Secret!</li>
            <li> you shower, keep your face wet.</li>
            <li> I DON&#x27;T WET SHAVE</li>
            <li> partial</li>
            <li> However, I wouldn&#x27;t have ANY DOUBTS about it if the wet shave were my thing.</li>
            <li> this product is non-comedogenic -- just be careful of what oils these products have.</li>
            <li> I used as directed and put 3 drops on my wet hands and rubbed it on my face.</li>
            <li> Alpha Gel, including blue and green types).  </li>
            <li> I se a straight razor and will never shave without Shave Secret.  </li>
            <li> Not really convinced.</li>
            <li> With a lightly wet face, it works well with my electric shaver.  </li>
            <li> The instructions say to add water not lubricant to reduce drag.  </li>
            <li> Because you only need a few drops, it makes for a non-greasy shave.</li>
            <li> The trick, is to keep one&#x27;s face wet.  </li>
            <li> Wet your face, then apply THREE drops of baby oil.  </li>
            <li> My husband struggles with pulling when he shaves, especially when we travel and the water is so harsh.  </li>
            <li> today was a test shave, I pressed harder than ever</li>
            <li> If, used correctly with the razor you will not have regrets and your skin wont be damaged.</li>
            <li> and I just put it in my wet hands and apply it to my wet face.</li>
            <li> I just took up wet shaving, and was searching the web for pre-shave oils.</li>
            <li> try not to be so closed minded about products,</li>
            <li> but you need alot of drops and you have to keep your face wet all throughout shave.</li>
            <li> Also it changed color after a few days of being open?</li>
            <li> Thanks for sharing the Secret, you have found a customer for life.</li>
            <li> When using a few drops of this oil on my face or mixed with my shave soap it keeps the razor from rusting!</li>
            <li> I have to look and feel carefully to see where I&#x27;ve shaved.</li>
            <li> cuts are minimal and infrequent&lt;br /&gt;Value:  </li>
            <li> I initially tried 5 or 6 drops, and ended up with paradoxically a rather uncomfortable shave (razor just glided over the face without shaving much of anything, so I had to work harder to shave).</li>
            <li> Wet your face apply oil shave.  </li>
            <li> ...I&#x27;ve been wet shaving (DE/Safety) for about four weeks now (about 8 times) and had been using a shaving soap.</li>
            <li> and I had some drag too.</li>
            <li> use two drops on each wet cheek and each side of my throat after getting out of the shower.</li>
            <li> You only need a few drops.  </li>
            <li> Generously wet the area to be shaved&lt;br</li>
            <li> Shave Secret works very well as a pre-shave oil.</li>
            <li> Just wet your face, put about 5 drops in your wet palm and message it into your face.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need anymore than a few (I use 4) drops to get the cleanest, closest shave you can possibly get!  </li>
            <li> Add to wet face in shower.  </li>
            <li> You simply apply a few drops to your hand and then rub it on your wet face before you shave with your blade razor.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Who would have thought that a few drops of oil applied to wet skin can make such a difference in shaving comfort and effectiveness!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to a soap and water shave, since I&#x27;m usually in a hurry and have limited shower space for extra bottles.</li>
            <li> First I wet my neck, then squirt a little bit of Shave Secret into a slightly wet hand, before applying it- to my neck.  </li>
            <li> I have heard radio advertisements that rave about it, and I have come to a partial conclusion that the advertisers either have never used the product just to get paid for spreading the &amp;#34;GOOD NEWS&amp;#34; or have actually tried the product had little or no success with it, and continue to promote it because it pays the bills.  </li>
            <li> A single bottle lasts me on average 3 months</li>
            <li> You do have to be religious about keeping the area wet as you shave, as the water is what helps it stay slick; if you don&#x27;t, it will start to drag.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised at how little there was in the small bottle.</li>
            <li> May seem expensive but worth every penny because only a small amount gets used every time.</li>
            <li> , I have been using the same bottle of Shave Secret for weeks, the next bottle I will place a date on it to see just how long it lasts.</li>
            <li> This is one of the few products I can put on my face without having major pimple outbreak a few days</li>
            <li> Wet your face and add 3 drops to a wet palm, BAM!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap enough to take the plunge, you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Shave Secret is a decent shaving oil.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Like others I&#x27;ve picked this stuff up and put it down at Wal Mart several times due to its gimmicky look.  </li>
            <li> Seems a little expensive considering how long I can get a soap puck to last; so then I think it will be more expensive.</li>
            <li> I am not sure visually</li>
            <li> Forget the the other shave creams, ointments, after shaves and balms.</li>
            <li> I shave my head, but not my face, every other day and</li>
            <li> One other note:  </li>
            <li> but you will have to look carefully!  </li>
            <li> I have since ordered 2 other brands of shave oil to give them a try.</li>
            <li> But the other day...    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had this feeling when using any other shaving product on the market, not even with pre-shave</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything for razor burn with nothing working that well- who would think a small product like this would actually work for razor burn-</li>
            <li> No more do those unsightly bumps show up days later to wreak havoc.</li>
            <li> However, I don&#x27;t think I will be using this product mostly due to the smell.  </li>
            <li> When I first tried this out, I was extremely skeptical.</li>
            <li> And since you only need a few drops, the small bottle lasts a surprisingly long time (months).  </li>
            <li> bought this item with http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008O82O7C/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_15 this razor due to the fact that it is a hell of a deal.</li>
            <li> Every other product makes me avoid or postpone shaving because it&#x27;s uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It makes us rely on other customers for this info.  </li>
            <li> I used this oil to shave both my head and face for  2 weeks without cuts or other incidents, and did not need to use shaving cream or anything else.</li>
            <li> Why is it sold in such small amounts?</li>
            <li> I used semi-hot water to keep my face wet and the blade glided over the stubbles with ease!  </li>
            <li> This is definitely a unisex product even though it is usually stocked with the men&#x27;s shaving items in stores.</li>
            <li> My first shave felt creepy, like Mac from \\&quot;The Predator\\&quot; dry-shaving; that&#x27;s what it looked like in the the mirror.</li>
            <li> I go back and forth between this product and my usual foam shaving cream.  </li>
            <li> other reviewers, I&#x27;ve found that my hair has a tendency to clog the multi-blade razors.</li>
            <li> Those other Breathers can do what they want.</li>
            <li> I have a small bump just above the lip which is always getting nicked, but not with this oil.</li>
            <li> Smells a bit like cloves, that&#x27;s my only small gripe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use this with a DE razor with Feather blades (incredibly sharp).</li>
            <li> Other than that the product works well.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first...</li>
            <li> when it&#x27;s done, its an extremely close</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cleaner than any other shaving material, and it does not leave rashes on my face like other products.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical like a lot of other first time users</li>
            <li> I used to shave every other day because I didn&#x27;t like the hassle of shaving.</li>
            <li> You really do only need a few drops!  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t tried it on any other part of my body, but don&#x27;t see why it wouldn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Not like some other 5 star review.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical when this first arrived, but I must say I was blown away by this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving for over 20 years and have tried gels, foam, shaving soaps and even other shaving oils.</li>
            <li> I would usually give my face a rest as was starting to get a bit bumpy from the week.  </li>
            <li> I usually cut myself, especially with my old-school \\&quot;safety razor\\&quot;, with the double-edged blades.</li>
            <li> I use a few drops as a pre-shave with soap or cream to get a little extra glide.</li>
            <li> used a very harsh laundry detergent which caused me to break out in a rash all over my legs, arms, stomach, sides, back and even the groin.  </li>
            <li> I was also doing lot of experiment on it as my hair is very rough .</li>
            <li> I received Shave Secret as a gift and was hesitant to shave with a new product.  </li>
            <li> Overall it just didn&#x27;t improve my shave enough, and as mentioned made it worse on parts of the neck.  </li>
            <li> I have used shave secret for several months now with both electric and double edge shaving.  </li>
            <li> It still took several days for the rash to go away but simply re-applying the Shave Secret helped until the rash was gone.    </li>
            <li> is much easier to use and doesn&#x27;t destroy your razor like Shave Secret will.  </li>
            <li> Holy cow.  </li>
            <li> I like the product, even though the shave is about the same as the gel I previously used, because of the additional benefits, as follow:  less messy, can use it</li>
            <li> I found out later from the makers of \\&quot;The Total Shaving Solution\\&quot;, (TTSS) that the inventor of Shave Secret used to work for TTSS.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving Shave Secret 4 stars but likely should have given it 5 but only because I&#x27;ve used it just once.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Shave Secret for some time and will probably not go back to regular shaving cream.  </li>
            <li> My only criticism is that it is difficult to clear the shaved particles from the razor.  </li>
            <li> Over the past several weeks I have seen the dark spots diminish.  </li>
            <li> My local big box store has stopped stocking Shave Secret</li>
            <li> I like that it is both faster and less irritating than the normal shaving method.</li>
            <li> Typically, the ones that evade the blade gets pulled as the razor moves past, causing skin irritation and possible breakouts.  </li>
            <li> comments talk about plugging the razor, this may be a problem if it happens with cartridges like Fusion which are expensive and hard to clean.</li>
            <li> At age 82 I&#x27;ve done a heckuva lot of shaving, with both conventional and electric razors.</li>
            <li> But I take the star off because there is really no way to use as little as they say.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s also very green, since it&#x27;s a blend of essential oils it breaks down easier in septic systems and doesn&#x27;t worry the water systems like typical shave creams in a can.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I cut myself less than with other products.</li>
            <li> That experiment lasted less than a week, because it felt like I was scraping my faces with a sharp rock.  </li>
            <li> If you have a hard time getting a shave without the after-effects of irritated red skin, this product is for you.</li>
            <li> Currently using this along with a rather dull mach5 razor, still no skin irritation.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first, I&#x27;ve been trying to get away from canned foaming shaving products for a while.</li>
            <li> My only problem was that no matter how hard I tried, I would nick myself quite a bit.  </li>
            <li> It is hard to believe that you only need 5 drops.  </li>
            <li> A little expensive for this product, but I was aware of the price when I ordered it.</li>
            <li> I am not interested in spending the time and dealing with the mess of a cream which has always been one of the benefits of an electric over a manual safety razor.  </li>
            <li> The bottle is small, but you only use a few drops with each shave.  </li>
            <li> It lasted me about 6 months saving my entire legs and armpits at least three times a week.  </li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> Because \\&quot;Shave Secret is crystal clear on the skin, you can&#x27;t tell by sight where you have shaved.</li>
            <li> I gave it a shot for a while, but not worth it in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I always get a least a few nicks with a disposable and not nearly as good a shave as with the higher quality blades.</li>
            <li> Over that time frame I began to notice dark spots or \\&quot;aging\\&quot; spots on my scalp.  </li>
            <li> but if you are a woman, as I am, and use it to shaves your legs, it is NOT economical.</li>
            <li> There is a hint of a metallic odor, but it is minor and not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I always had, regardless of the method, before using shave secret with the proraso sensitive soap.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how soft my skin felt, and I didn&#x27;t get those irritating bumps.</li>
            <li> My wife has a sensitive nose, and she cannot stand to go in the bathroom for hours after I shave with Shave Secret.  </li>
            <li> I am in the military and shave everyday.</li>
            <li> However, I was forced to use it a second time when I forgot my electric shaver and was away from home.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent tons of money on razors, multi-blade razors, shave soaps, and shave cremes, what a waste of money and none of them gave me as close a shave as I now have for just pennies</li>
            <li> its a thick enough coating on the epidermis to prevent abrasion and its astringent qualities are all in one.</li>
            <li> (I hate it when shipping charges are more than the cost of a product.)</li>
            <li> As a matter of fact, I was using only 4 drops of the oil and even tried rubbing it in the palm of my hands to heat it up for application, but it was still too thick.</li>
            <li> Wet your face, place a few drops in your palm, work the oil into you skin, then shave.</li>
            <li> Everyone else, if a black guy with the genetically worst possible facial hair for daily shaving can look fresh everyday with this stuff, I KNOW</li>
            <li> I fully expected it would, due to the rough shaving experience.&lt;br /&gt;After giving it four tries, I stored this in the back of the cabinet for unlikely emergencies.</li>
            <li> I have been using Gilette since I was in Jr. High School, I even tried other brands like Schick and others because the Fusion and Mach 3&#x27;s are just too darn expensive.  </li>
            <li> Shaving with Shave Secret feels very similar to dry shaving.  </li>
            <li> I use a 2-blade razor to cut down on ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> Probably every pass down your face</li>
            <li> Since the Walmart is down the street from me</li>
            <li> Hands down...</li>
            <li> It cuts down on razor burn and ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li> Five drops and shaved both ways - down then</li>
            <li> first time I figured maybe I got a bad batch since it has to at least live up to half the hype</li>
            <li> Money well spent in this product!!</li>
            <li> No more razor burns or dry skin.</li>
            <li> my__ humble opinion (except for any evaluation marked with an &#x27;*&#x27; - which means use common sense!).</li>
            <li> I noticed less drag, less irritation or scratching (which occurs from uneven or bumpy skin) and slightly a closer shave.  </li>
            <li> A little lasts a long time, very little needed.</li>
            <li> After just a few uses, my razor was less than sharp.</li>
            <li> and I have less irritated spots on my head compared when using it.</li>
            <li> I experience less irritation and razor burn after using this product.  </li>
            <li> Only a few drops make for the smoothest shave with the least preparation I have ever encountered.</li>
            <li> When traveling, it takes up a lot less space</li>
            <li> I promise you one thing, use this stuff and you will never use shaving cream again, I bought this stuff a couple weeks ago and have used it 4 times, there is no way ill ever go back to my regular ways of shaving.</li>
            <li> I typically shave with a soap, brush, and mug.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At less than 3.50 give it a try.  </li>
            <li> Much less irritation that using drugstore cream.  </li>
            <li> But, the tube is ~$30 and lasts less than a month.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It seems less viscous that the product I&#x27;d used before.</li>
            <li> Anything less</li>
            <li> This replaces the creams and aftershave I previously used to shave.</li>
            <li> Less redness and bumps.</li>
            <li> Less ingrown</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, SSSO contributes to slight clogging of my razor with whiskers that stick to the blades.</li>
            <li> and I seemed to have less razor burn.  </li>
            <li> As a side note, I use a double edge safety razor, but Shave Secret will help any man that wet shaves, regardless of brand or style of razor.  </li>
            <li> IF NOT using a shaving oil, I recommend trying all three; cost: less than $24 - You won&#x27;t regret switching to shaving oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use shaving oil when traveling since it takes up less room in my luggage &amp; complies with TSA liquid restrictions.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You simply wet down the area again with water and that area is freshly slick again.</li>
            <li> It is easier and less mess to use than shaving cream.</li>
            <li> It claims to prevents nicks, cuts and ingrown hairs (which is all true, otherwise I would have given it just 1 star), but what they fail to mention is that it will not only do a very poor job of allowing you to remove ALL of your hair, it also ruins your razor!</li>
            <li> Another small downside (or rather something to get used to) is that since there is no lather, it&#x27;s a bit harder to tell where you&#x27;ve gone over and where you&#x27;ve missed.  </li>
            <li> It was like cutting a hot knife through butter.</li>
            <li> I could mess up with the angle of the blade,&lt;br</li>
            <li> All for $3.99 a bottle (on average a bottle lasts me a few months).  </li>
            <li> I suspect it would be a mess until I got used to it.</li>
            <li> The groin are took the longest to heal and, after trying a variety of other treatments, I decided to use the Shave Secret on my groin area - worked like a charm and the itching dissipated almost instantly.  </li>
            <li> I know other reviews warned of needing to thoroughly rinse your blade frequently, but this was just silly.  </li>
            <li> It helps if you&#x27;ve dry shaved successfully at least once before.  </li>
            <li> At first, you might think that around $4.00 for such a small bottle is rather expensive, however, I find that this small bottle outlasts almost two of my aerosol shave gel cans which cost over $2.50 a piece, so in the long run the \\&quot;Shave Secret\\&quot; oil is actually less expensive.</li>
            <li> A lot less messy than shaving cream though.</li>
            <li> but when you shave everyday and can use a \\&quot;stick razor\\&quot; less (although it gives you the closest shave)</li>
            <li> Basically all this is is some oil mixed in with Menthol (the main cooling agent in this product) and essentially it does not do anything but create a tingling, almost numb &#x27;cooling&#x27; sensation on your beard area when you shave, and this weird tingling remains after you wash it off too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had to use about 15 drops and still did not feel it spreading.</li>
            <li> so plan on going through those a little faster.  </li>
            <li> It seems to allow the razor to cut the hair easier, little or no tugging.</li>
            <li> A little background...</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t believe it, but this little bottle has changed the way I shave.  </li>
            <li> and i am looking for an oil with a little stronger fragrence.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been using this about every other day for the past 4 months.</li>
            <li> Stop buying shaving cream and all that, this little bottle is all you need.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I bought this, as I thought that no small amount of oil would produce the smoothest shave ever.</li>
            <li> It takes a little getting used to since there is no visible indication that it has been applied to one&#x27;s face.  </li>
            <li> course, using oil does make the razor get a little gunky.</li>
            <li> Amazon price seems a little steep.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found I could even shave with this oil alone along with my safety razor with little or no discomfort.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let this little unassuming wonder fool you.</li>
            <li> I use shaving soap and a brush at home, but I like this stuff for travel, because it takes up so little space in my toiletry kit.  </li>
            <li> just the thing you want to smell when you put a Rotter down for the count!</li>
            <li> So the next time you&#x27;re stocking up on ammo and MREs, don&#x27;t forget to pick up a little bottle of Shave Secret.  </li>
            <li> Tough to put into words how much this secret oil has changed my mornings.</li>
            <li> was a little doubtful at first as I have only used a shaving cream / gel in the past, tried this</li>
            <li> This product really helped with regard to cutting myself up.</li>
            <li> The secret is to apply 3 - 6 drops on an already wet face with wet hands.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.  </li>
            <li> was using razor blade cartridges for years and always got my skin sore at the end of the week and needed a few days to heal.</li>
            <li> Shave secret + double edge safety razor (Feather Blades, in my case) &#x3D;</li>
            <li> and I like that his face isn&#x27;t so dried out and flakey, as it is when he uses shaving cream.</li>
            <li> This Shave Secret is also cheaper at Walmart, $3.48 for the same bottle.  </li>
            <li> I hate that feeling - but smooth.</li>
            <li> However it   was distinctly a poor second.</li>
            <li> just a few drops and no need for shave cream or mug soap</li>
            <li> I have to shave everyday for work</li>
            <li> SHAVE SECRET SHAVING OIL was purchased as a gift to save weight when traveling internationally.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Can&#x27;t go wrong with this if you have sensitive skin and are looking for an alternative to shaving</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> However, Shave Secret has tamed my beard--there is no way I would ever go back to foam or gel for shaving.  </li>
            <li> Wilkinson Sword Double Edge Safety Razor Blades (Amazon), and six drops Shave Secret Shaving Oil.</li>
            <li> It has a heavy clove oil smell</li>
            <li> Use a few drops as an after shave also.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve retired my badger-hair brush and shaving soap for a few drops of this.  </li>
            <li> boyfriend shaves his face EVERYDAY with this now, a close shave everytime.</li>
            <li> I did not enjoy using this product at all.</li>
            <li> Conditioner is still my go to solution for when I have skipped a few days.  </li>
            <li> &quot; If an oil causes the razor to drag, then it is way too thick.</li>
            <li> It takes 20 drops for one leg and at that rate you will run out in a few shaves.</li>
            <li> I think its a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried shaving cream a few times over the years just to prove to myself</li>
            <li> the next pass of the razor was even worse...</li>
            <li> Heavy stubble practically falls off like butter.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Add a few drops and a few drops of water to area  Shave.</li>
            <li> WASTE OF $.  </li>
            <li> but it always seemed like something was missing.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need but a few drops.</li>
            <li> Prior to using Shave Secret, I used William&#x27;s Lectric Shave; have also used the powered shaving block also for a pre-shave for electric razors.  </li>
            <li> I use a few drops of SSSO in each area and shave away.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for a few days now and don&#x27;t get any shaving irritation using my DE razor.</li>
            <li> I threw the bottle out after a few days.</li>
            <li> I use a few drops for each side of the face.  </li>
            <li> but I think it&#x27;s a waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;5</li>
            <li> I have trouble spots along my jawline and where the side of my neck meets the chin and by reading the reviews, thought it might help.  </li>
            <li> The trouble spots it helped some, but not as I hoped.  </li>
            <li> The secret is, the bottle is tiny.</li>
            <li> My coarse hair that grows every which way is now match for my shave secret and DE safety razor combo.</li>
            <li> Maybe there something I&#x27;m missing here.&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Maybe there something I&#x27;m missing here.&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Beyond that, I have rather sensitive skin and the menthol feel reminds me of what my skin starts to feel like when something&#x27;s going wrong, but then nothing happens, no rash or redness or anything.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a big fan of the scent of Shave Secret.  </li>
            <li> I hate to say it, since I like it so much, but I&#x27;ll probably be using it instead of my brush set for daily use.    </li>
            <li> Not a huge deal.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It clogs my razor (E. Jagger) badly and is hard to clean under running water or shaking in still water.</li>
            <li> I still got some irritation, but less than usual.  </li>
            <li> Since using this, he says it is easier to shave plus it looks less irritated after!</li>
            <li> I will rank these oils as first, second, and third - Sorry, there are no participation trophies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical that a little bit of this oil would do anything, but I really can feel the razor gliding easier and not pulling my whiskers as I shave.</li>
            <li> I shave every other day and one bottle has lasted me at at least two months.  </li>
            <li> I kept thinking about those sharp, sharp Russian blades and the Feather razor that I was afraid to use for fear of bleeding to death.</li>
            <li> My husband says that this is not easy to use when he&#x27;s trying to shave his head with this electric shaver.</li>
            <li> One little bottle lasts me 3 months, I have to use 5 drops, instead of the usual 3 drops per the instructions.  </li>
            <li> As a Black male shaving can be difficult because of razor bumps, and you dare not shave against the grain.</li>
            <li> The unfortunate thing about Shave Secret is that the only retailer that carries it (that I can find) is Walmart, which I personally avoide at all costs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the product itself, or if it&#x27;s exfoliating off a lot of dead skin, or what.</li>
            <li> I found that shaving with Shave Secret alone was a little rough, so I added a shaving soap and that did the trick.  </li>
            <li> Before I started using this product, my face would feel raw after shaving.</li>
            <li> And when they say a few drops, they *mean* a few drops.  </li>
            <li> However it seems to be less expensive in the long run.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite difficult for me to have sharp edges and lines on my beard and mustache with the wet razor route.</li>
            <li> I used two methods, one as directed coating the skin with a thin layer before applying the lather and the other where you put a few drops in your lather bowl and whip it in with your chosen soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> little bottle lasts about at least 3 months for me, shaving daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now if there&#x27;s any skin irritation it&#x27;s very little.  </li>
            <li> You need very little oil.</li>
            <li> It is like there is no blade in the razor to drag through tough whiskers.</li>
            <li> It is like there is no blade in the razor to drag through tough whiskers.</li>
            <li> It is a little weird to get used to after using a foam or a gel for so long.</li>
            <li> so I was ready for what I thought would be a painful swipe.</li>
            <li> I am not sure what&#x27;s it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> As you can see, I don&#x27;t usually write reviews but</li>
            <li> No more irritation or unsightly razor bumps on my neck.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ve got a slick shave</li>
            <li> I was not satisfied with shaving foams, so I switched.  </li>
            <li> I heard the radio hype surrounding this product and wanted to put it to the test; I payed out almost seven dollars for a small bottle of oil to put it to the test.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not to mention it stinks like &amp;#34;essence of old man&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> It will extend the life of my blades as I used it with a blade I had used five times when I usually replace at 3.</li>
            <li> So I wet my face, added 3 drops shave secret, and gave it a whirl.  </li>
            <li> couple years ago I actually stumbled across this product but was skeptical.</li>
            <li> I didnt have to apply another application of the product to keep my face slick.</li>
            <li> Soap- no more than 3 times per week.  </li>
            <li> Actually I am not sure the shave is any closer or that the oil just makes the skin feel smoother and softer.   </li>
            <li> I used to get expensive shaving creams by Gilette and such that didn&#x27;t do their job.  </li>
            <li> No more razor burn, bumps, or ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> I proceeded to cut my hair, again with the clippers, trimmers, and the screen shaver at the end as usual.</li>
            <li> If you must go the wet razor route...shave secret DOES NOT MAKE BUBBLES, FOAM,</li>
            <li> Add 4-5 drops of Shave Secret in my wet palms&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li> No more bumps or razor burns.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like one of those TV infomercials, just screaming &amp;#34;BUY ME!!!&amp;#34; in the most awful 90s-kind of way.</li>
            <li> A little shady if you ask me!</li>
            <li> For years I have had razor burn and irritation, and just this one small bottle ended that.</li>
            <li> I spread one or two at a time over small regions of my face/neck.</li>
            <li> Second, this is one UNCOMFORTABLE shave.</li>
            <li> I have shaved at least once everyday.</li>
            <li> It helps but I&#x27;m not sure for the price</li>
            <li> although not better than shaving gels or soap)</li>
            <li> This past Christmas</li>
            <li> Not many Knicks when shaving with this.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Still not sure if it makes a bit of difference to a shave though.</li>
            <li> Not a grand combination.  </li>
            <li> As for Pros: the bottle is small, it is plastic</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s small...</li>
            <li> It may work ok but that smell is awful.</li>
            <li> Shave as usual.</li>
            <li> Not many for this price, but my rule of thumb is that if you are looking for a quality shave, avoid anything sold at walmart.</li>
            <li> BUT, the electric razor, although kinder on my skin, would sometimes drag, making for a frustrating shave experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Problem</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a small price to pay.</li>
            <li> No more razor burn.</li>
            <li> I tried different things, I even went to the expensive brushes hoping it would help.</li>
            <li> (I have a very heavy beard).  </li>
            <li> My only question is  why has Shave Secret been a secret??</li>
            <li> and it still was not very good.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve discovered though, that it does work well to keep the blade oiled between uses, and I&#x27;ve used it for a few other random items that needed oiling.</li>
            <li> The method I prefer is using hot water on my face the ad 3-4 drops of oil as a base coat</li>
            <li> Shave Secret knocked that down probably</li>
            <li> I mean it usually looks like I shaved with a rock.</li>
            <li> To my surprise Shave Secret cut my shaving time in half.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a small price to pay.arp Russian blades and the Feather razor that I was afraid to use for fear of bleeding to death.</li>
            <li> I hate shaving, it always irritates my skin and leaves it dry especially in the winter.</li>
            <li> I had hardly any nicks and no cuts today.  </li>
            <li> Of course is not a problem with the Muhle and Astra DE blades which I keep in the razor for 2-3 weeks until they start to become dull and it is time to replace them.</li>
            <li> After getting used to the oil, it feels like I shaved with a dull butcher knife.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are certainly some positives for the product, and that is why I didn&#x27;t hate it.</li>
            <li> I bought Shave Secret to use at the gym as it is small and takes very little space in my gym bag.</li>
            <li> If you follow these rules the negative reviews of this product are nullified.</li>
            <li> at least 90%!!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using shaving cream for at least 20 years.  </li>
            <li> At least for me, it works</li>
            <li> This is probably one of the worst marketed products on earth because it&#x27;s absolutely fantastic.</li>
            <li> I must use at least 6-7 drops of it , not the 4 as the manufacturer says .</li>
            <li> It just is a total disappointment.</li>
            <li> I figured this stuff would be crazy pricey, but it is about the same as a container of shaving cream.</li>
            <li> have thick curly hair</li>
            <li> I discovered Shave Secret when they gave a sample away  at the San Diego Marathon a few years ago.</li>
            <li> With a splash of water on my face and just a few drops of Shave Secret oil</li>
            <li> I hate that stuff.), but much faster.  </li>
            <li> Water, just a few drops of Shave Secret</li>
            <li> or so since I hate it so much-</li>
            <li> A splash of water in your hands and a few drops of Shave Secret rubbed into the skin</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t recommend it alone since the product is very concentrated and oily and the hairs that are shaved stick on the razor and becomes really annoying.</li>
            <li> I tried shaving with JUST this oil, and also used the oil as a base under my shave cream, and both shaves were good (though I prefer to use it as a base).</li>
            <li> I noticed the difference immediately after using Shave Secret; just added a few drops and rubbed it into my skin well.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really not a huge secret.  </li>
            <li> I mean looking quite &#x27;unkept&#x27; if you will),</li>
            <li> What do I mean by \\&quot;too thick?\\</li>
            <li> Unbelievable!  </li>
            <li> Now when I shave, I get no, and I mean no, irritation.</li>
            <li> This oil caused my razor to drag horribly and that is not a good thing when using a straight razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried some expensive shave creams in the past in addition to a few pre-shave oils.</li>
            <li> But with my long hairs, I was afraid,</li>
            <li> The razor just glides across your face, leaving behind an unbelievable smoothness.  </li>
            <li> I usually nick my neck when I shave, but not when I shave with Shave Secret.</li>
            <li> Put a small amount of the Shave Secret Saving Oil and then put the saving gel.</li>
            <li> The smell is subtle, yet invigorating.  </li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> There is no way I could use this product without suffering some serious consequences.  </li>
            <li> Seriously?  </li>
            <li> The scent is also subtle, and it gives you an invigorating sensation on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It should be cheaper this little bottle is so small for the price you pay not worth it :(</li>
            <li> I mean less painful, smoother and ever a little quicker.  </li>
            <li> Feels a little weird while shaving</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say its a little expensive, but</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m shocked this stuff actually works.  </li>
            <li> I will say that with Shave Secret, the face shave was even closer at least to the touch.  </li>
            <li> Closest, least irritating shave ever.</li>
            <li> No need for any alcohol based aftershave lotions (which are not good for your skin anyway).</li>
            <li> Was skeptical, but intrigued with the idea of not using messy shave cream.</li>
            <li> Not a good product and would not order this again.</li>
            <li> Dont be afraid to use it but be careful with your eyes since it has menthol it cna</li>
            <li> If I use regular shaving cream or lotion, regardless if it is for senstive skin, I will breakk out and the itching is PAINFUL.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not good at all.  </li>
            <li> Man I got the worst shave rash on the right side of my neck</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving serious consideration to switching to Shave Secret full-time</li>
            <li> This is especially a little intimidating when shaving your head.  </li>
            <li> I am usually disappointed and left with another product that I will not use.</li>
            <li> This stuff did nothing but gunk up my razor and was very hard to even get off my skin afterwards.</li>
            <li> The shaving cream won&#x27;t even tough your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Keep it a secret.  </li>
            <li> Shave Secret should be in every man&#x27;s medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> Second, because it an oil base product it was almost as if I already had applied after shave lotion sooth my skin and face(it has menthol in it as well).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Bought for my son and husband!~SHAVE SECRET SHAVING OIL-</li>
            <li> After buying Shave Secret I don&#x27;t use anything else</li>
            <li> This is a secret that deserves to be told.</li>
            <li> The oil lubricant seems thin and flimsy (when you are used to lathering up your face).</li>
            <li> Shave secret, gel, and a proglide razor.  </li>
            <li> After applying Shave Secret, I apply shave soap, with a Tweezerman shaving brush.  </li>
            <li> BUY Shave Secret.   </li>
            <li> The Secret is out.  </li>
            <li> He had Shave Secret recommended to him and then, in turn, told me about it.</li>
            <li> Shave Secret instructions say to use 1-2 drops if using electric shaver.</li>
            <li> SECRET IS</li>
            <li> , ALL you would need is Shave Secret + Water, Period.</li>
            <li> I was confused</li>
            <li> I have been using Shave Secret for about 3 weeks.  </li>
            <li> I like the scent of Shave Secret too.  </li>
            <li> I plan to include Shave Secret with gifts.</li>
            <li> Shave Secret is my favorite.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So not happy about that</li>
            <li> I let my dad borrow Shave Secret, and he was amazed as well.</li>
            <li> Not great.</li>
            <li> I just started using SECRET shaving oil</li>
            <li> Shave Secret (Oil) did just that.</li>
            <li> I have had no skin issues since using shave secret.</li>
            <li> but I didnt use it stand alone, I used it as a base coat to proraso regular soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re so lost and confused.</li>
            <li> Five days ago I purchased Shave Secret from a Wal Mart after hearing all the accolaids on the radio about it.  </li>
            <li> I think Shave Secret should be kept just that, a secret.  </li>
            <li> , I opted for the Shave Secret Shaving Oil that Amazon&#x27;s trusted customers were raving about.</li>
            <li> if desired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s the secret.</li>
            <li> Nothing feels worse picky legs when you crawl into bed.</li>
            <li> Shave Secret gets my business from now on.</li>
            <li> Worse, this stuff smells like the chain lube that I use on my bicycle.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s my secret.</li>
            <li> I drop four or five drops of Shave Secret in one hand, rub both hands together, then rub it into my beard.  </li>
            <li> Also, the ingredients are mildly irritating, I would not repurchase.</li>
            <li> I recommend Shave Secret 200%.</li>
            <li> I bought shave secret at wal mart.</li>
            <li> I use shave secret all over my face</li>
            <li> the way I bought secret shave at Walmart.</li>
            <li> and I added water to try and thin it out.</li>
            <li> this the best-kept secret in shaving products for men?  </li>
            <li> this the best-kept secret in shaving products for men?  </li>
            <li> So Shave Secret along with a shaving soap still saves money.  </li>
            <li> Then I kept hearing ads on a talk show radio program that inspired me to buy Shave Secret.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;You too will be in on the secret.</li>
            <li> The Shave Secret oil cost about six bucks.</li>
            <li> With gray whiskers, when I apply Shave Secret to my face, I can&#x27;t see it.</li>
            <li> The Shave Secret oil cost about six bucks.</li>
            <li> With gray whiskers, when I apply Shave Secret to my face, I can&#x27;t see it.</li>
            <li> I never bother to write any reviews about any products but shave secret deserves it</li>

            <li> Somersets, Shave Secret, King of Shaves</li>
            <li> I started using Shave Secret about 2 years ago.  </li>
            <li> Shave Secret is quite something</li>
            <li> Like I said time for the other stuff, too bad.</li>
            <li> Decent shave but nasty smell, in the trash it went, I&#x27;ll stick with Proraso.</li>
            <li> To make things worse, I typically cut the crap out of my face and put up with some pretty nasty razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The difference is not always dramatic.  </li>
            <li> No more nicks no more bloody shirts.</li>
            <li> I take shaving very seriously.</li>
            <li> I was not impressed with Shave Secret on my electric razor, so do NOT recommend buying it for that.  </li>
            <li> but I   found the Shave Secret difficult to rinse off my face.     </li>
            <li> Needless to say my face was not happy afterwards.</li>
            <li> BUT you cannot go wrong with Shave Secret.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving all of these years with the wrong product.</li>
            <li> (I don&#x27;t remember what it was), I was a bit skeptical.  </li>
            <li> way, I am looking forward to trying my electric shaver with Shave Secret!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of this product&#x27;s claims until I tried it.  </li>
            <li> These rave reviews have got to be fake.  </li>
            <li> fall for the fake reviews..</li>
            <li> Dunno why its so expensive here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> And sorry, manufacturers of styptic pencils, I won&#x27;t need you anymore.....  </li>
            <li> Those folks need to be given a shave using their product to see how useless they are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would be sad if they ever stopped making it.</li>
            <li> So I was skeptical</li>
            <li> I find it weird to not use any shave cream or anything else</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with the purchase of this product.</li>
            <li> Not really impressed with it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is expensive, and for that reason alone I wouldn&#x27;t take a star off.</li>
            <li> Shave Secret is everything it promised to be!  </li>
            <li> but I was totally wrong.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a bit sad.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical,  but the proof is in the result,  and the result was quite pleasing.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical but after seeing the reviews I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> putting steel to flash has always been a scary proposition for men throughout the ages.</li>
            <li> Well, that&#x27;s all you NEED with Shave Secret, brother!    </li>
            <li> Also I followed all of the directions and even looked at reviews to see if I was doing something wrong.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this product but decided to try it anyway.  </li>
            <li> it is difficult to tell where you have shaved and where you still need to.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been buying some fairly expensive shaving products for about 3 years now.  </li>
            <li> Fake accounts?</li>
            <li> But I found it completely useless.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but this was recommended by a trusted friend.  </li>
            <li> Still recovering from my ill purchase...</li>
            <li> My beard is very thin, like a kid</li>
            <li> your face slightly then use at least 4 drops and rub it in your face, and whala!!!!!</li>
            <li> If for some reason it&#x27;s not working that well for you at least use it as a base.</li>
            <li> Try Shave Secret you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> This was really disappointing.  </li>
            <li> aid electric razor without cutting skin</li>
            <li> You still have to rinse every two to three cutting strokes.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;m hooked on it.  </li>
            <li> I also ended up cutting myself two or three times every time I shaved.</li>
            <li> Well, I was proved wrong!  </li>
            <li> I was VERY skeptical because it was so affordable, and I had heard it advertised on almost all of the talk radio</li>
            <li> In fact the annoying random pimples have stopped also.</li>
            <li> think it would be very difficult to talk me into switching now.  </li>
            <li> It is too bad.</li>
            <li> I would be bleeding badly after shaving my mustache and beard.  </li>
            <li> so bad you can&#x27;t use it ( and it will not rinse )</li>
            <li> I have not discounted the notion that maybe I purchased part of a bad lot, but I am unwilling to pay yet another $3.82 for another.  </li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t buy again but wouldn&#x27;t give it a bad review.</li>
            <li> It does help shaving but it is bad for your skin.</li>
            <li> Friends would often comment how bad the rash around my neck looked.</li>
            <li> My legs ALWAYS burn after I shave them, and I get a lot of ingrown hairs and painful razor burn.  </li>
            <li> SHOCKED.</li>
            <li> you will not be disappointed after buying this.</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed with this product.  </li>
            <li> a bit disappointed...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bad that the makers won&#x27;t just come out and list the base ingredients for those of us who may have sensitivities to them.  </li>
            <li> I read one of the reviews, and the person was sorely disappointed because the razor dragged.  </li>
            <li> I am disappointed with this product for a number of reasons, but will mention some positives and negatives about it here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I hope this stays a secret!!!</li>
            <li> I like the clove smell though; if you don&#x27;t like clove you&#x27;ll hate this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think I would really hate this product if I were using a cartridge razor -</li>
            <li> I hate menthol smell.</li>
            <li> Beats the heck out of the foamy crap in a can.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work well by itself for shaving my beard but works like a charm as a base for shaving using my everyman jack shaving lotion.</li>
            <li> I really hate their packaging and marketing.</li>
            <li> - so I do know this product isn&#x27;t crap.  </li>
            <li> I hate shaving.</li>
            <li> , you will grow to hate it,</li>
            <li> but I prefer to use an alcohol base after shave to cut the oil a bit.</li>
            <li> I hate to shave; I prefer to have shaved.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awful, it does not make the razor glide over your skin.  </li>
            <li> It doesnt wash well out of a razor and smells awful.</li>
            <li> Well holy crap!  </li>
            <li> Worst shave i ever had.</li>
            <li> My husband has the worst razor burn on his face after shaving.</li>
            <li> Being required by my job to shave every day takes a nasty toll on my skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awful.</li>
            <li> For me, this product is terrible as a stand alone shaving cream.  </li>
            <li> For 25 years I have had to put up with nasty razor burn that itched and burned my neck.</li>
            <li> Worst drawback for me is that I lose track of what&#x27;s already been shaved without the foam to use as a guide.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> either i&#x27;m not using it right or it just doesn&#x27;t work. is no better than soapy water, maybe not as good.</li>
            <li> Works great, as long as you continually rinse off your razor.</li>
            <li> Produces a clean-shaved head with no bumps.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.  I&#x27;m a mug and brush guy.  Was looking for something fast and effective.  Its neither.  Smells good that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this product, I was amazed. The next few times, not so much. I liked the scent and the ease of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I did not like was that my new razor clogged so much faster than with any other gel or cream. A simple solution - an old toothbrush to clean blades. After just a few uses, my razor was less than sharp. I can usually go many shaves without replacing razor, but once I used this product less than 5 times I had to toss my razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the smell and the moisturizing for after shaving conditioning, but will not use it to shave with. It is too bad. I had such high hopes for this product.</li>
            <li> If this works for you or others, good - but here is my experience:&lt;br /&gt;Has a clove smell, more so than you would detect in an Old Bay aftershave, if you do not like the smell of cloves this is a real put off.&lt;br /&gt;The advertised 2-3 drops all that is needed to use, in my case another falsehood.&lt;br /&gt;Eliminates the need for soap, gels, moisturizers - for me that was a full wagon of horse manure claim as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I perform a pre-shave (I use a double edge razor) ritual of hot moist towel to the face to get the skin and whiskers ready, for this product I did not then apply more water to my face just prior to using a brush and shave soap lather - with a damp face and wet hands I used three drops into the palm, rubbed the together per instructions and then to my face,  Could not get full face coverage with just that few drops is the first issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried to shave and found it a major irritation, I finally figured at that point the product was not going to work.  I will use what is left to dribble onto my shave soap each time I use it, at least it will have some purpose and not just be thrown away which was my first thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your money, save your face, save your time, skip this product</li>
            <li> If you have a hard time getting a shave without the after-effects of irritated red skin, this product is for you. It replaces your shaving cream, and with just 6 drops coats your face with enough lubrication to effectively trim your beard. It has a pleasant spicy aroma and washes away very easily without leaving your face feeling oily or dehydrated. A single bottle lasts me on average 3 months and I shave daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this with my electric wet/dry razor from Panasonic for pure shaving heaven. No nicks, scrapes or cuts and absolutely no red irritated skin. It&#x27;s cheap enough to take the plunge, you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Husband swears by this. Just a tiny bit each day instead of shaving cream.</li>
            <li> Ok not great. It&#x27;s perfect to keep in a travel bag in case you forget shaving cream.</li>
            <li> This works great. My neck is sensitive, and always gets bloodied up. This product really helped with regard to cutting myself up. Only thing I don&#x27;t like, it causes my razors to clump up with hair, and I go through more razors.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awful, it does not make the razor glide over your skin.  My legs were so torn up by the time I was done shaving that I through the rest away.</li>
            <li> I read a lot of reviews when trying to decide whether or not, and which brand of shave oil to buy.&lt;br /&gt;To address some of the concerns voiced here-&lt;br /&gt;Price point is fine.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is mild, not offensive, I would say pleasant- in any event it doesn&#x27;t linger.&lt;br /&gt;I do feel that I end up using a fair amount more than they recommend.&lt;br /&gt;As far as usefulness goes- I purchased it to help keep a good edge on my beard by keeping it more visible than under shaving cream and it does that just fine.&lt;br /&gt;For the price its worth a shot to try it if you&#x27;re on the fence like I was.</li>
            <li> I am not sure what&#x27;s it is supposed to do. Rather use shaving cream instead.</li>
            <li> Worthless...soap worked better.  I bought this to reduce my liquids for air travel.  Ended up just leaving it in a hotel and bought a tube of shaving gel.  Any oil works better than this...don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Really good stuff! Has a nice clove scent, not too strong and doesn&#x27;t linger. I use a few drops as a pre-shave with soap or cream to get a little extra glide. I&#x27;m getting better shaves than ever and zero irritation.</li>
            <li> Works perfect!!  No problems at all.</li>
            <li> This shaving oil changed my life. I purchased a Panasonic electric shaver and I use it every day with oil. The shave is as good as razor blade with almost zero irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was using razor blade cartridges for years and always got my skin sore at the end of the week and needed a few days to heal. With this oil and the electric shaver, that is completely gone.</li>
            <li> This stuffs amazing. I&#x27;ve been shaving all of these years with the wrong product. I am NEVER buying shaving cream again!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m shocked this stuff actually works.  I thought it was just another marketing hype when I bought it, but thought it was such an inexpensive thing to try, why not?  But I tried it this morning for the first time and it really does work just as described.  My razor just flowed across my skin.  It even worked well on my head, which is a lot more sensitive.</li>
            <li> I use this stuff as a pre-shave oil. 5 drops rubbed on my face, then lather with Van der Hagen shave soap and a brush. I then shave with a Merkur 180 safety razor and Dorco blades. No nicks or irritation, super smooth close shave.</li>
            <li> Keep it a secret.  It doesnt wash well out of a razor and smells awful.</li>
            <li> I have to say, when I received a sample of this stuff, with another of something else (I don&#x27;t remember what it was), I was a bit skeptical.  But it was free so I went ahead and tried it.  Wow, first off the stuff smells great.  2nd off, it really does give you a better shave.  I switch between an electric razor and multi blade razor (like a mach 3)depending on how much time I have to shave or my mood.  In using this stuff with both types of razors, I got a better shave, and I think (but can&#x27;t objectivily prove) that my non-electric razor, lasted a little longer than usual.&lt;br /&gt;3.  I&#x27;m guessing because of the menthos component you face feels nice and cool after the shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in given how little this stuff costs, and how little you actually need to use, I think its a great value for a great price.</li>
            <li> Decent shave but nasty smell, in the trash it went, I&#x27;ll stick with Proraso.</li>
            <li> Words cannot describe how amazing this product is. I was skeptic but because the price was so low I ordered it. Let me tell you this is the best shaving apparatus ever. It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve ever used. You don&#x27;t even feel the blade on your face and you will get an ultra smooth feeling skin after. Wow just wow..... you will not be disappointed after buying this.</li>
            <li> I can really feel the difference while shaving. I was very skeptical that a little bit of this oil would do anything, but I really can feel the razor gliding easier and not pulling my whiskers as I shave. I still use shaving cream after applying this oil, and it works great.</li>
            <li> I have always shaven with an electric foil razor, dry.  After recently purchasing a new wet/dry electric, I opted to test our Shave Secret.  I am not interested in spending the time and dealing with the mess of a cream which has always been one of the benefits of an electric over a manual safety razor.  That this product is quickly absorbed and requires only a few drops, made it worth trying for me.    I have always been satisfied with the closeness of the shave on my face.  I will say that with Shave Secret, the face shave was even closer at least to the touch.  I am not sure visually I can see much difference, but rubbing my hand across my face yields a closeness I have not recalled since using a safety razor.  However, on my neck which is the area of greater challenge to an electric, I found that Shave Secret actually made the problem worse.  I found that some of those areas on my neck that my new electric was finally able to get cleaned up to a reasonable degree, were no longer able to be shaved as well.  This was really disappointing.  Additionally, I found I needed to make sure the face remained quite wet because as it dried it became \\&quot;sticky\\&quot; in that the razor did not go over the skin very well (versus a dry shave without using anything).  Lastly, I am not a big fan of the smell.  Although not obnoxious and it doesn&#x27;t linger, the overall smell is like a combination of eucalyptus and baking spices (nut meg, etc.)  Wasn&#x27;t really what I was looking for.    Overall it just didn&#x27;t improve my shave enough, and as mentioned made it worse on parts of the neck.  As a result I went back to dry shaving which continues to work fine.  I think if I were using a manual safety razor this product would be worth a closer look as it surely is easier and less messy compared to foams.</li>
            <li> Well holy crap!  This stuff really works.  They are not kidding when they say 3-5 drops!  Why has no one told me of this product before?  I cannot tell you how delighted I am with this product!  I picked it up yesterday at Wal-Mart for under 4 bucks.  I have really coarse facial hair and just started going old school and bought a twist to open safety razor last week from here.      I have been using Gilette since I was in Jr. High School, I even tried other brands like Schick and others because the Fusion and Mach 3&#x27;s are just too darn expensive.  I even tried high dollar electric razors, nope, they will not work for me.    I was thinking that the razor blades that came with my new kit were cheap and I have been butchering my face for the last 4 days.  Well, I tried this stuff this morning and I will tell you that it is night and day and my shave is so close it&#x27;s awesome.  I have been able to even get those sideways hairs on my adams apple.  The best part about this stuff is that you can actually see what you are doing because there is no foam or soap lather.     Oh yeah, I forgot to mention that I shaved before my shower just to test this stuff out.  Normally I will shave in the shower or after I get out so my skin will be moist and the hair soft. I had hardly any nicks and no cuts today.  Plus my skin feels so soft and smooth.  Some people have reviewed that they don&#x27;t like the smell of it, I think it smells pretty good and I like the coolness from the menthol.  That&#x27;s just me.  I will say that for the cost and how long I think it will last pretty much outweighs the smell.  I wish I would have known about this product sooner, it really is a \\&quot;Shave Secret\\&quot;.  Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this in a race bag, now I don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t find it sooner! I&#x27;m used to a soap and water shave, since I&#x27;m usually in a hurry and have limited shower space for extra bottles. But, after using this I&#x27;m hooked. My shave was close, smooth and left my skin feeling silky. I love the smell, slightly spicy clove, but it&#x27;s light, not overwhelming and after drying off I don&#x27;t smell it lingering at all.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also very green, since it&#x27;s a blend of essential oils it breaks down easier in septic systems and doesn&#x27;t worry the water systems like typical shave creams in a can.&lt;br /&gt;Happily I&#x27;ve also found it to be a good moisturizer too. A couple drops after I shower and I&#x27;m soft, not scaly. Pretty versatile!&lt;br /&gt;Bonus is I never feel greasy or oily. Just soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth trying for the price!! Love it!</li>
            <li> Great product that I have been using know for about a year. Gives me a clean, close, and comfortable shave everyday. More than worth the cost. A bottle lasts more then a month. About 40-45 shaves.</li>
            <li> I have been wet shaving for about 14 months. Here are my pros &amp; cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;Inexpensive&lt;br /&gt;Does provide a decent shave&lt;br /&gt;Its cheap enough to at least try out for those still experimenting&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;Tends to waterproof - wet shavers need to be careful&lt;br /&gt;Not that silky smooth razor glide&lt;br /&gt;Oil and soap/creme mixture will quickly clog DE razor crevice - rinse often&lt;br /&gt;Its oil - you may have to re-clean your hands and face pores if your skin clogs easily</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how little there was in the small bottle. The instructions said to use 3 to 5 drops, but I found that was enough to cover your upper lip at the most. I had to use a minimum of 10 drops, and could have used more. It&#x27;s good stuff, but you will have to use more than recommended in the directions. Bottom line - the little bottle won&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> As you can see, I don&#x27;t usually write reviews but this product I picked up at walmart and I cant believe how good it is...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so impressed with it that I told everyone in the office and they all bought it...guess what...  They love it too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its awesome.Its awesome.Its awesome.Its awesome.Its awesome.Its awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My shaving regime was once a week due to sensitive skin of bumps and lots of bleeding bubbles a few days later if I shaved twice a week.  With this, I can shave multiple times in a week...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is all I use now and I hope walmart doesn&#x27;t stop carrying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;great for travel...</li>
            <li> Works better than any pre-shave I ever used! Will be purchasing more and telling my friends about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MK - Texas</li>
            <li> I use a Panasonic wet/dry shaver and have wet shaved with fine creams. And the results were great. But I can shave with Shave Secret and get an even better, as well as quicker, shave. My recommendation is to 1) wet the face with warm (not hot) water, 2) add 5 or 6 drops of SS to condition the skin, and 3 begin shaving after about a minute. As the bottle states, just re-wet with water those parts of the face needing additional conditioning.</li>
            <li> I really love this product, and have bought over 20 bottles and sent it to my home country, for dad, dad-in-law and others.  Its amazing, works really well, has made shaving a pleasure as opposed to a chore.</li>
            <li> I started shaving my head over the Summer and experimented with several tools and techniques. Much to my surprise, Shave Secret was easily the best of the prep products. I could make multiple passes without irritation, ending up with soft, baby-smooth skin. I recently let me hair grow back, but I continue to use the Secret on my face, and I&#x27;m about to order my third bottle. I typically use double the recommended 4-5 drops, but it still seems like a bargain. As others have mentioned, oil and hair can get clogged between multiple blades, so be sure to use an open-back design, which lets water flow between the blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a very satisfied customer. I don&#x27;t know how they came up with this, but it really works: smells good, feels good, does the job.</li>
            <li> Got this for my husband as a stocking stuffer. He uses a DE safety razor and he loves it and says it definitely works. He was a traditionalist about his foamy soap so I didn&#x27;t think he&#x27;d really like it, but now he prefers the oil. He says its best for shaving around a goatee or beard because unlike soap he can still see where he&#x27;s shaving.</li>
            <li> This is a great product that makes shaving so easy. It&#x27;s small size makes it is great for anyone travelling on an airplane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The company that shipped did so quickly and even followed up to ensure that all had gone well. All of that for a &amp;#60;$8.00 item. Bravo!</li>
            <li> Short and to the point - this stuff works!  There is no razor \\&quot;drag\\&quot; so I&#x27;ve eliminated razor bumps and minor cuts that I experienced with regular shaving cream.</li>
            <li> Buy and use it every time you shave</li>
            <li> The product is great, but spendy. I stumbled upon [[ASIN:B0040BBLLW NOW Foods Solutions Comforting Massage Oil -- 16 fl oz]] at my local health foods store. I decided to try it for shaving, and it&#x27;s great! In fact, it&#x27;s cheaper, smells better, no greasiness in tub, and larger bottle. No I&#x27;m not paid by anyone for this review.  It took a little work to figure out how to edit my original review of this product from years ago.</li>
            <li> Excellent. It worth the price. You won&#x27;t regret.</li>
            <li> WOW! Forget the the other shave creams, ointments, after shaves and balms. This does it ALL. Best shave I have ever had using this.</li>
            <li> I shave my head, but not my face, every other day and this stuff has lasted me about 5 weeks.  I use 15 drops per shave and I think this is well worth the $4.  This stuff is much better than any foam I have used and I have less irritated spots on my head compared when using it.</li>
            <li> Never buy shaving cream again.  I was skeptical, at first, but soon joined the ranks of the many reviewers who love this product.  The smell is subtle, yet invigorating.  Shave Secret should be in every man&#x27;s medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> Its just OK... I bought this from Wal-Mart (much cheaper there) TWICE!&lt;br /&gt;The first time I figured maybe I got a bad batch since it has to at least live up to half the hype then I will try it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thick curly hair and although I followed it EXACTLY to how the instructions stated and it just didnt work for me at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first tried it while I was using cartridge Mach3 razors and it always clogged the razors easily when combined with shaving creams. When I used it by itself it gave too much drag and had to use at least twice as much as directed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I later switched to a double edged razor in which I used this oil to prep my face before added the lather of my shaving cream (C.O. Bigelow which is great) and it drags a bit, You have to use much more than 3 drops and the consistency is just too thick (especially for double edged shaves).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will recommend any pre-shave oil that is much thinner if you are using a double edged safety razor. I will not purchase this stuff ever again.</li>
            <li> I have fair skin that is sensitive and varies from dry to oily. I always have to shave with the grain under my neck. I never get a truly smooth shave and have always had razor burn and blemishes in this area.    I saw Shave Secret in Walmart and thought it might be worth a try.    I now have the smoothest skin ever! My blemishes are gone after over 25 years! My skin feels great and is as smooth as a babies bottom!    Buy this product!    One other note:  The oils do cause the hair to clump in the razor. I shave in the shower and just hold the razor up to the shower head and rinse it as I shave. I also rinse my head and face before, during and after the shave. The Shave Secret stays in place and feels great!</li>
            <li> I use a DE razor and Shave Secret, and the combo has been very effective for me over the last six months. I would say my facial hair is of normal coarseness, and fairly dense, and I only need to use 3 drops of this stuff to get a nice close comfortable shave.  The secret of course is to use plenty of water at the start and re-wet as needed, not add more oil. I was a little disconcerted by the clumping of the hair in the blades, but just one or two  quick shakes in my rinse basin (okay, it&#x27;s just an old Tupperware container filled with some warm water ) and it&#x27;s just fine. The smell isn&#x27;t overpowering since I use so little, and at this rate I expect the bottle to last another six months, if not a little longer.  My skin is much happier now than when I was using shave soap and a brush. No more irritation or unsightly razor bumps on my neck. No nicks either, and no mess associated with the brush and soap. Overall, a definite  improvement for my shaving experience.</li>
            <li> I used this only as a pre-shave, under shave soap lathered with a brush, so I cannot comment on how it works alone. It did do a good job as a pre-shave.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised. Three drops gave me the smoothest, closest shave of my life. Bought a bottle for my best friend who had the same experience.</li>
            <li> I have bought a bottle to use for my new Panasonic es 8103 s wet and dry rechargeable razor. I&#x27;ve used this oil twice now with edge gel, and all seems to be well. This is the first time that I&#x27;ve used an electric razor wet for shaving. I think this oil is a very good choice for me. Thanks</li>
            <li> Great stuff.  Used with the razor pit.  I haven&#x27;t bought another razor since I got these.  No shaving cream either!</li>
            <li> I have used shave secret for several months now with both electric and double edge shaving.  I got the best results when I used a quality double edge razor (vintage gillette or mekur) and followed up the shave secret application with proraso sensistive shaving soap.  I no longer get the red face or blemished I always had, regardless of the method, before using shave secret with the proraso sensitive soap.  I will say though that the price on Amazon is quite high when you factor in the shipping.  Walmart has it for around $4 with no added shipping coasts.  You can also go directly to the \\&quot;shave secret\\&quot; factory site and get it in bulk (which I do).  All in all, wherever you buy the product it is worth the money.</li>
            <li> I never would have bought this stuff had I not got a sample in a goodie bag for free.  I was perfectly happy with my old-fashioned safety razor and soap &amp; brush combo.  I was pleasantly surprised how well this stuff works.      The bottle is small, but you only use a few drops with each shave.  And when they say a few drops, they *mean* a few drops.  People who have had problems with gunking up the razor or poor performance, I suspect used too much oil - I did too the first time and received poor results.  Once I cut pack and just used 2 drops in each palm, I got better gliding and no razor gunking up.  It does give quite a close shave, and is a pleasant smell (unless you don&#x27;t like clove/menthol-y smelling things).    You do have to be religious about keeping the area wet as you shave, as the water is what helps it stay slick; if you don&#x27;t, it will start to drag.  Another small downside (or rather something to get used to) is that since there is no lather, it&#x27;s a bit harder to tell where you&#x27;ve gone over and where you&#x27;ve missed.  I have heard this stuff works great when adding a drop to regular lather, but honestly I&#x27;ve been fine with it by itself.  It seems to help with razor burn a bit.    I don&#x27;t generally use aftershave with it, since it smells nice and does the job on it&#x27;s own.  I hate to say it, since I like it so much, but I&#x27;ll probably be using it instead of my brush set for daily use.    Overall, very glad I tried it, and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Works nice, great product.</li>
            <li> Received a sample of this at a race recently and gave it a try.   It works!   I use it both with my electric and regular razor.    Smooth shave.</li>
            <li> I tried this product with a 5 blade razor and it gave a very close shave,the best part of all no irritation! Shave Secret help me get an excellent shave under my neck area which I could not get very well with shave gels with making it irritated. Second, because it an oil base product it was almost as if I already had applied after shave lotion sooth my skin and face(it has menthol in it as well).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside(possible negatives) to me is the oils seem to clog my razor a bit, even though I was rinsing my razor after every stroke. The directions said to use 3-5 drops, I used 4. I will try 3 next time and see if that helps.  Also, the smell of the product could turn some people off( it lists cloves as one of the products) It has a spicy scent(I don&#x27;t mind it).&lt;br /&gt;Either way, I am looking forward to trying my electric shaver with Shave Secret!</li>
            <li> Heard about this on The Blaze radio, and figured it was worth $4 to try it out. Follow the instructions on the bottle for the best shave I&#x27;ve ever had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was different having to keep my face wet and rinse/smack my multi-blade razor more frequently to prevent clogging, but it was a very smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a little worried about leaving it on my face when I was done (not washing the remaining oil off with soap), because I thought it would clog my pores or something, but I just dabbed with the towel like the instructions said, and my face felt great for the rest of the day. Really great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After switching to a DE safety razor I noticed some advantages of this combination. You can&#x27;t \\&quot;clog\\&quot; them, you can see what you&#x27;re doing instead of just seeing foam, and you don&#x27;t have to reapply if you take too long on one side and the other dries out, you just re-wet the area and you&#x27;ve got a slick shave again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At 5 drops per shave, this bottle has at minimum 60 uses. Assuming $4 a bottle, that&#x27;s 6 cents a shave. I&#x27;ll take that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure why it&#x27;s like $6 online, it&#x27;s under $4 at walmart.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I picked this up at the store. It has really help reduce skin irritation quite significantly. I&#x27;ll use the oil for as long as its available.</li>
            <li> I discovered Shave Secret when they gave a sample away  at the San Diego Marathon a few years ago. I couldn&#x27;t believe how soft my skin felt, and I didn&#x27;t get those irritating bumps. Sometimes a few days later I would get the bumps, but I found that doing one of two things would prevent them:  1. Take one drop of Shave Secret with warm water and rub it on the area after every shower.  2. Use Neutrogena Sensitive skin after shave lotion (again, every day...don&#x27;t stop using it just because you used it once).  The unfortunate thing about Shave Secret is that the only retailer that carries it (that I can find) is Walmart, which I personally avoide at all costs.</li>
            <li> II haven&#x27;t used this product long enough to have an opinion</li>
            <li> Terrific in every respect----performance was better than expected and service by the seller was great!  Thanks!  Dr. Cary</li>
            <li> You will be surprised by this product.  I&#x27;ve been testing different ways of getting a really close shave.  I was not satisfied with shaving foams, so I switched.  Using shaving cremes with a brush resulted in much closer shaves.  Shave Secret surprisingly, works just as well as shaving cremes. It&#x27;s small size makes it great for travelers too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to thoroughly wet your face and hands with warm water before applying Shave Secret. Also, clean your razor&#x27;s blades under warm running water while shaving.  It helps if you&#x27;ve dry shaved successfully at least once before.  Shaving with Shave Secret feels very similar to dry shaving.  But the results are amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shave Secret also has a light menthol smell that can wake you up a bit.</li>
            <li> I first used this product for shaving in the field during The Basic School. I purchased this for a deployment to Afghanistan.The bottle is very small, you get many shaves out of it and it doesn&#x27;t require many precious water bottles for the post shave rinse. The small size of this product alone makes the purchase worth it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t agree with all of the hype. It is a little too thick and a little too strongly scented for my tastes. I think that baby oil or good old soap make for a smoother shave.</li>
            <li> It works.  I enjoy shaving with this in the shower.  I used to use shaving cream or gel, but I like to shave in the shower and the cans would become rusty and leave rust stains in the tile.</li>
            <li> The shaving oil doesn&#x27;t really lubricate that well - in fact, it&#x27;s pretty gummy and drags a bit and clogs your safety razor.</li>
            <li> Shaving has been taken to a whole new level and my wallet is a little fatter because of Shave Secret.  For only a few dollars you get an awesome shave with just water.  I do not (and for the most part would not reccommend) using aresols with this product.  Just water and SS.  A bottle will last you a long time.  I shave every other day and one bottle has lasted me at at least two months.  Walmart carries it but you will have to look carefully!  Only downside (which I find to be the razors fault) is that the \\&quot;magic gel strip\\&quot; that is next to the blades wares out extremely fast by not using shave gel/cream - so plan on going through those a little faster.  I think other guys on here are traditionalists and use safety razors and less modern blades; however I have been very pleased with the modern razor and SS.      You will not regret this purchase (period).</li>
            <li> Bought for my son and husband!~SHAVE SECRET SHAVING OIL- THE BEST SHAVE EVER! 18.75ML...worked fine but my husband still prefers electric shave!~</li>
            <li> Just as advertised!  It really is the best.</li>
            <li> Good seller, The item delivered on time, was as described.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product, one tube last me about 6 months. Does not lather, so you can see exactly what you are shaving. Great for fancy beards! This is the second time I ordered this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When using this product be sure to tap out your razor often, and clean it thoroughly when you are done. If you follow these rules the negative reviews of this product are nullified.</li>
            <li> I have electoric shaver and thought shaver might be smoother if I drop the oil on shaver&#x27;s blade.  I searched oil in Amazon and found it.  That&#x27;s good for shaver.  I think my shaver moves smoother than before.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of this product&#x27;s claims until I tried it.  I got a nice, close shave (no nicks.. knock on wood).  I also noticed a significant decrease in in-grown hairs.  I&#x27;m neutral on the clove scent.  I&#x27;ve found five (5) drops works best for me.  I&#x27;m giving serious consideration to switching to Shave Secret full-time</li>
            <li> Shave Secret is unbelievably good.I have a tough facial hair growth and it really makes short work of removing it. Your face feels tingling fresh and vibrantly clearer.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.  I would have never thought it would work so well until I tried it for myself.  It&#x27;s pretty much replaced all the fancy shave soaps/badger brush nonsense with a much simpler solution.</li>
            <li> I use 3-4 drops of this stuff before applying my shaving soap or cream. Has a very pleasant clove smell that isn&#x27;t too overwhelming and does a great job at reducing the occurrence of knicks and cuts.</li>
            <li> I saw the glowing reviews on Amazon and decided to order it.  I have used numerous different products to try to minimize irritation.  This stuff is inexpensive and works fabulously.  I use five drops a day on my wet face and then put Kiehl&#x27;s shave cream on top.  I love the menthol \\&quot;burn\\&quot; and I notice that even with a used blade I get a smooth, ultra-close shave.  I do not feel the same irritation by Friday or Saturday that I was accustomed to.  I probably could get by with a double blade razor alone but will continue to alternate my Mach 3 turbo with a dispo double blade.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband who has sensitive skin and prone to ingrown hairs and razor burn on his neck underneath his chin. He uses it both as a shave oil and as an &amp;#34;after shave&amp;#34; depending on the response of his skin. He loves it and we will be buying more when he runs out.</li>
            <li> I use it with&lt;br /&gt;Muhle R89 Grande razor&lt;br /&gt;Astra Superior Stainless Double Edge blades&lt;br /&gt;I have compared SS with Gillette aerosol soap foam&lt;br /&gt;I have not compared it with soap/brush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wash my face with hot water&lt;br /&gt;I pour 3 drops of SS in my palm&lt;br /&gt;I rub my palm where ever I am going to shave mainly &amp;#34;counter&amp;#34; hair.&lt;br /&gt;Shave and rinse the blade often.&lt;br /&gt;If skin start to get dry I just get it wet with hot water.&lt;br /&gt;Shave as usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving is great and better than with aerosol foam. It is also nice to see the skin not covered by foam.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using SS for 3 weeks and I  do not see any time to change it, it is great.&lt;br /&gt;Soap and brush may be better but working full time and have to leave very early in the morning is not an option for me.&lt;br /&gt;I can also see the convenience of traveling with SS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some comments talk about plugging the razor, this may be a problem if it happens with cartridges like Fusion which are expensive and hard to clean. Of course is not a problem with the Muhle and Astra DE blades which I keep in the razor for 2-3 weeks until they start to become dull and it is time to replace them.</li>
            <li> This product works really well.  I have to use five drops for my beard not three as it says on the packaging and I haven&#x27;t been able to work up a lather with oil, so I think that was a misstatement but the product works well and I probably will not go back to lather.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband after hearing an ad for it in the radio. He&#x27;s always nicking himself while shaving. I was surprised to see the little bottle, but what a BIG impact it had. He LOVED it!! The shave us so smooth and you only need 3 drops. I just ordered 2 more firmly brother in law. Money well spent in this product!!</li>
            <li> Shave secret + double edge safety razor (Feather Blades, in my case) &#x3D; Best Shave ever.     I usually follow with bump patrol (original formula) and then spf 30 face cream.     It took me 5-6 years of regular shaving to find this regimin, but I highly recommend the above combination to anyone who does not currently love their shaving experience.</li>
            <li> Shave Secret works great. It is easier and less mess to use than shaving cream. I get a very clean shave with it.</li>
            <li> Seems to work ok. I don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s much better then the shaving cream I use now. I use a DE89bl razor and this product while good and functional, did not appear to be any better than my current canned cream.</li>
            <li> I heard the radio hype surrounding this product and wanted to put it to the test; I payed out almost seven dollars for a small bottle of oil to put it to the test. I&#x27;d rather use shaving cream; it comes out of the can as a foam; no need to add more water or keep pushing it around your face unlike shave secret. Shaving cream costs a dollar a can; you get many mores shaves out of seven cans of cream than you&#x27;ll get out of this bottle AND - you&#x27;ll enjoy the shave more than with this stuff.</li>
            <li> After buying Shave Secret I don&#x27;t use anything else and I can&#x27;t believe this product isn&#x27;t more popular.  With a splash of water on my face and just a few drops of Shave Secret oil I have the most consistently close shaves ever.  I even use a couple of drops when I use my electric shaver and it seems to help reduce the irritation.  Sadly, with Shave Secret there is no satisfying lathery foam, and there seems to be only one scent (sort of cinnamon and spicy), but it does the best job of any shaving lotion/gel/foam I&#x27;ve ever used.  Close shave, no irritation or dryness, no mess to rinse off when your done.  This is a secret that deserves to be told.</li>
            <li> Shave Secret was a real surprise. It shaves close and leaves your face so smooth. Love it!</li>
            <li> I was a little reluctant to purchase this when I saw it at Walmart but the words on the packaging just got the best of me and I tried it.  I will never look back.    I have sensitive skin and a roommate used a very harsh laundry detergent which caused me to break out in a rash all over my legs, arms, stomach, sides, back and even the groin.  The groin are took the longest to heal and, after trying a variety of other treatments, I decided to use the Shave Secret on my groin area - worked like a charm and the itching dissipated almost instantly.  It still took several days for the rash to go away but simply re-applying the Shave Secret helped until the rash was gone.    The point is that Shave Secret gives you a very close shave AND it is effective on rashes, too!</li>
            <li> I use it every shave!</li>
            <li> Shave Secret turned out to be a good introduction to shaving with oil vs. foam or soap.  I got a good shave with the Shave Secret oil, but they claim it has a &amp;#34;hint of menthol&amp;#34;.  This is a pretty strong hint.  My wife has a sensitive nose, and she cannot stand to go in the bathroom for hours after I shave with Shave Secret.  It doesn&#x27;t really bother me, and the menthol does give it a kind of tingling feeling, but that doesn&#x27;t help much when I cannot use it at home.  Having learned of the comfort of shaving with oil, I looked around and found coconut oil highly recommended.  I am now shaving with coconut oil and like it much better, and my wife loves the subtle fragrance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d heard about this product on the radio. It is everything that they claim. My husband is impressed with it and I like that his face isn&#x27;t so dried out and flakey, as it is when he uses shaving cream.</li>
            <li> I, too, found my first Shave Secret at Wal-Mart and almost passed it up because it looked like one of those \\&quot;info commercial\\&quot; products.  It DOES work.  I put a drop on each tip of three fingers and dab each finger on each cheek and chin after a prep with water.  The oil seems to just keep spreading as I rub it in although it does not seem to at first.  Shaving works really well.  It is true that my razor gets clogged, but it&#x27;s no big deal to keep it clean by swooshing it in my basin with water.    Here&#x27;s the thing: This is a good product because it works well and it is an OIL.  Shaving cream etc. are part soaps--they work to dry out your face.  Oil is better.  BUT, I have found almost any oil will work just as well (perhaps with more than a few drops but not much more).  I tried Kuma Sutra oil and it worked fine--plus it smells better--plus it is cheaper--plus I wipe the leftovers over my face to condition it.  SO, I give this four stars because it does what it says well.  Only four stars, though, because there are cheaper and better alternatives out there.</li>
            <li> Lets you shave without knicks or bumps.  Really works as advertised.  Cannot express how impressed I am with this product.  Smells great too!!!</li>
            <li> I hate shaving, it always irritates my skin and leaves it dry especially in the winter. I gave this product a try and it does exactly what is says, smooth shave with no razor burn, bumps, ingrown hairs or anything like that. It gave me the closest and most comfortable shave I have ever had. Works great for BOTH hand razors and electric, give it a try and you won&#x27;t be disappointed!!!    I recommend this product to everyone. This product will even work well for women for shaving their legs, really comfortable and close shave!</li>
            <li> The shave oil is pretty good overall. It gives a good smooth covering on the face. I have not found that this can replace the use of shave gel overall. but makes for a nice addition to my routine. I found that it is also a good value for the money overall as not a lot is required.</li>
            <li> I have recently started shaving my head. Shave secret shaving oil (purchased from local Walmart) is undoubtedly better than the standard shaving gel or cream. With a single application you can shave at least twice just by putting more water on the shaving area. I never had such a close shave before!</li>
            <li> almost perfect-still learning to use it</li>
            <li> These rave reviews have got to be fake.  And I fell for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shave Secret does not work better than shaving cream, in fact it&#x27;s far worse. And I got a major razor rash after  trying this out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not to mention it stinks like &amp;#34;essence of old man&amp;#34;.  As a middle-aged man myself, I was hoping to avoid this smell for another 40 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to have to take another shower today because rinsing it off at the sink just wouldn&#x27;t eliminate the funk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thankfully I bought it in-store for $3 rather than the gouging prices online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t fall for the fake reviews.. Save your money!&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> Works great. Be advised that Walmart has this for like $3. I picked it up in the shaving aisle. Save even more money on this great product.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve never seen any commercials or anything on this!  My legs ALWAYS burn after I shave them, and I get a lot of ingrown hairs and painful razor burn.  All it took was a few drops of Shave Secret, and I have less ingrown hairs and after shaving, I never get redness and my legs don&#x27;t burn anymore, and my legs are SMOOTH after I shave!  It&#x27;s amazing and it&#x27;s only $4.  I found this at the Wal-Mart I go to, but I had to put a review on here.  It lasted me about 6 months saving my entire legs and armpits at least three times a week.  I just went back to Wal-Mart and bought two more.</li>
            <li> was a little doubtful at first as I have only used a shaving cream / gel in the past, tried this and WOW all that I can say, smooth shaves against the grain that I could never do with a cream or gel, keeps my face soft with the natural oils. cannot say enough good about this product.</li>
            <li> Wonderful addition to your shaving regimine.  The oil really helps the balde glide over your face and cut the whiskers rather than dragging and hacking.  I&#x27;m not the biggest fan of the menthol and cloves scent idea but it actually smells good yet not overpowering.  Read the various postings to help you decide but believe me, shaving oil is a definite positive addition to your shave.  Just put it on before you lather up and you&#x27;ll be good.</li>
            <li> I saw this stuff at WalMart several times before purchasing. Since using it, I can&#x27;t imagine ever using creme again. I use the 5 drops on a wet face and shave with a Fusion. Closest, least irritating shave ever. As a bonus, I seem to be able to use the razor long after the lubricant strip turns white. I tried it as an electric pre-shave, but didn&#x27;t find it as effective as with a blade. If you try it once, you will likely use it for life. Nice to find a product that exceeds expectations.</li>
            <li> Before this product I was constantly getting razor burn with traditional shaving cream. With this product, my neck rarely burns and has fewer cuts. I think it smells pretty good, and goes on quick, and the person using it only needs a few drops per time shaving. Rinse the razor often, and there will be no complaints. I&#x27;ve used this with Gillette Razors and a double sided safety razor.</li>
            <li> Great way to get a close shave</li>
            <li> Misread the directions and thought it was eyedrops. Burned like hell and since I couldn&#x27;t see, I shaved my eyebrows off instead - but it did a really good job, I didn&#x27;t feel anything while they were being removed.</li>
            <li> This product works great for me. It has made shaving much easier and quicker. It&#x27;s so much easier now for me to get symmetry and line up my facial hair. I really like it.</li>
            <li> It works fine, but I will stick to a quality gel in the future.  There is still a bit of razor drag that i don&#x27;t get with a drag.  It&#x27;s nice that there is no need to rinse though.  Nice smell too.</li>
            <li> I really wanted this to work. I don&#x27;t really have any issues with bumps but this stuff gave me them!! I had been using another shave product, from the guys who want you to buy their razors....... I thought this stuff gets great reviews and will take up less counter space. First time using it followed the directions, 5 drops in a wet hand an massage it in and shave. Man I got the worst shave rash on the right side of my neck I have ever had!!!! Like I said time for the other stuff, too bad.</li>
            <li> This products needs getting used to on two fronts if you normally have used shaving cream with a brush. The oil lubricant seems thin and flimsy (when you are used to lathering up your face). As you shave, the hair and oil residue gets accumulated in my 3- or 5-blade razor. I have to use an old toothbrush to dislodge the residue between successive strokes. (2 stars deducted for this inconvenience).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the positive side, the shave is reasonably good for my soft face hair, and it feels better on the skin after you are done because of the lubricating moisture that is left on your face. My face feels wet and soft instead of dry and parched. Also, it has a nice herbal smell that is left on your face. No need for any alcohol based aftershave lotions (which are not good for your skin anyway).</li>
            <li> Ok, I am very picky about what I use for my shaving needs. I have pretty sensitive skin and let me tell you..THIS STUFF IS AWESOME!! I first saw it at work, a coworker had a sample and gave it to me. I was HOOKED after the first use! I was worried about the smell but it&#x27;s really not that strong at all and after a little while it goes away. But if you can&#x27;t wait just wash your face after you shave. :)</li>
            <li> Works great but smells weird.</li>
            <li> Works exactly as advertised. Close, smooth shave without irritation.  Nice scent.</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed with this product.  Was hoping it would live up to the hype.  I shave in the shower and find that body wash is far superior than this oil.  Also, the 5 drops as sdvertised is no where near enough.</li>
            <li> This stuff is phenomenal!</li>
            <li> after reading all the reviews here, i ordered 3 of those... i must have had high expectations because i find it very very average. i thought i had found the miracle product but no... dont care much for the smell, and i dont think it is good at all... doesnt slide well on skin, and doesnt shave any closer than anything else ive tried... a bit disappointed...</li>
            <li> This stuff really works. But you can buy it cheaper at walmart.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff. I like the clove smell though; if you don&#x27;t like clove you&#x27;ll hate this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff lasts for a VERY long time, as you only need a few drops. I have extremely sensitive skin, but this stuff makes shaving so smooth that I use it in place of shaving cream.</li>
            <li> My son states this is the best shave he has ever had! His skin looks great!</li>
            <li> If you have thick, fast-growing, blade-resistant beard hair, this oil alone will not give you a comfortable shave. You still need to prep properly and may even still want to use hair conditioner and some Proraso before shaving. Smells really good though and it&#x27;s oil based but doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling oily afterwards. For medium to light bears, this would be the best product for you.</li>
            <li> I just started using the product two days ago. It is taking me some time to get used to no foam when I shave. It is giving me a closer shave. As a Black male shaving can be difficult because of razor bumps, and you dare not shave against the grain. Well I am able to shave against the grain with no razor bumps and have a smoother shave as a result. I pair this with a Blade Buddy and all is right with my shave. My head feels great and so does my face.</li>
            <li> Great product. I&#x27;ve had shavers foliculitus for a few years now and this certainly helped.</li>
            <li> I find that I need to use more than 3-5 drops per use - I dunno, maybe I have a big face - so it can go pretty quickly. Aside from the cost adding up pretty fast, it does its job very well. I have always suffered from shaving pains, and this works well whether I&#x27;m using a double edge blade, or a disposable 2 or 3 blade razor.</li>
            <li> Used it for the first time today and it worked great! It will extend the life of my blades as I used it with a blade I had used five times when I usually replace at 3. May be the smoothest shave I ever had with zero nicks! Great product!</li>
            <li> Simply amazing. After hearing an ad for this shave oil I decided to give it a try. I don&#x27;t really have really sensitive skin and ussualy use a shave gel. After the first shave i was a convert. I was telling the Mrs. about it an she gave it a try on her legs with similar results. Close smooth shave with no nicks. The oil shaves closer and faster than any gel i have ever used and my skin is smoother and softer than ever. it does take a little getting use to not being able to see where you shaved. I had not realized how much shaving cream dried my skin. The clove scent is nice and not overpowering. I have since ordered 2 other brands of shave oil to give them a try.</li>
            <li> I pretty much gave up on razor shaves years ago.  I loved the close shave, but hated the irritation and inevitable bumps.  Then I had a Braun electric high-end model, which I was really happy with.  Used it for about 3 years (changing foils, of course).  As far as electric shavers go, the shave was extremely close.  The main problem was I had to attack my beard from different angles and go over it repeatedly to get a close shave all-around.  That process itself caused some irritation (and was time-consuming), although I was finally rid of bumps.  But something inside of me always wanted to go back to a razor shave, that is, IF I could find the right razor and product.  My Braun still works, but battery doesn&#x27;t hold charge, and the cleaning mechanism broke years ago.  I tried the Schick Hydro 5 razor with gel...not very happy, lots of irritation.  I went back to electric, bought Shave Secret (it claims to be useful with as a pre-electric).  I was not impressed with Shave Secret on my electric razor, so do NOT recommend buying it for that.  But the other day...    I received a \\&quot;free\\&quot; Fusion ProGlide razor, so I thought it was the perfect opportunity to test my bottle of Shave Secret with a manual razor.  I didn&#x27;t trust in using it by itself on my several-days-old beard.  So I wet my face, added 3 drops shave secret, and gave it a whirl.  I was surprised that it helped the razor glide right off the bat.  But with my long hairs, I was afraid, not enough of the product was making contact with my skin.  So I overlayed it with Schick Hydro Gel.  HOLY HIGH HEAVEN!  The combo was awesome.  Shave secret, gel, and a proglide razor.  No bumbs, no irritation, and a very close shave.  I can&#x27;t ask for anything more!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 30/M and have been struggling with shaving my entire life. I know that might sound strange but I&#x27;ve got super thick hair which is literally capable of dulling even the sharpest razor on the first pass. To make things worse, I typically cut the crap out of my face and put up with some pretty nasty razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried dozens of shaving creams and razors. I even tried wet shaving for a bit with limited success. For the past year I&#x27;ve been using a Braun Series 7 electric razor which has actually been pretty great except for the fact that it doesnt provide the closest shave. Has done wonders for cuts and razor burns though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple years ago I actually stumbled across this product but was skeptical. Not buying it then was a huge mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is simply amazing. I brought this product on a business trip and tested it on a four day old beard (I&#x27;m a yeti my hair grows so fast). It was like cutting a hot knife through butter. What was really amazing though was how well it kept up. I didnt have to apply another application of the product to keep my face slick. One application and rewetting was enough to get the most pain-free, irritation-free, cut-free, closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving foams are mainly soap-based which dry out my skin. I usually have to moisturize my face immediately after shaving but with Shave Secret, my face felt soft and moisturized, nourished and healthy. I&#x27;ve never had this feeling when using any other shaving product on the market, not even with pre-shave oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell of the product is subtle and pleasant. I dont mind that the product only comes in one scent. It&#x27;s a great scent that makes me smell like a man, not a twelve year old boy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: buy this product. buy it now. its cheap, is long-lasting, and is literally the best shaving product I&#x27;ve ever used since i started shaving. post-shave face feels amazing, not dried out and tight. no cuts, no irritation,no razor bumps, no pain.</li>
            <li> I used to buy the shaving oil from the competition (King of Shave)and I was afraid that this tiny, much cheaper option wouldn&#x27;t just be as good, but I&#x27;m glad I was wrong, this thing is just as good or even better than the pricier British import, I see myself buying lots and lots of this thing in the future.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s great, no nicks or cuts, surpasses gels</li>
            <li> Shave Secret is a decent shaving oil. I never got nicked while using it. But it&#x27;s formula isn&#x27;t as good as others available. It can gunk up your razor and leave a greasy residue once you&#x27;re done. Not a bad choice, but not the best choice.</li>
            <li> Used to shave with cream, then started using an electric shaver.  I&#x27;ve been using the oil for about 3 weeks and really like it.  After my face got used to the blade, it get a nice smooth shave with no cuts.</li>
            <li> This stuff is cheap at Wal-Mart and gets the job done. I just notice that it breaks me out wherever I shaved. I use a 2-blade razor to cut down on ingrown hairs. But no, these are pimples, not razor bumps. When the oil is more clear, it doesn&#x27;t cause a problem. As time goes by (it&#x27;s only been a month since I bought a tube), the oil yellows. And that&#x27;s when I break out. Not worth it. Skip.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything for razor burn with nothing working that well- who would think a small product like this would actually work for razor burn- thx so much-</li>
            <li> I purchased this because it seemed like it would be a really convenient way to have a quick and decent shave with my safety razor.  Turns out it *was* a really convenient way to have a quick and decent shave with my safety razor.  I use it by itself when I don&#x27;t have the time or energy to use my shave soaps and brush.  The smell is interesting - I don&#x27;t love it, but it&#x27;s not bad.  And the shave is a little less comfortable than shaving with a traditional shave soap (Not the canned stuff. I hate that stuff.), but much faster.  No need to build a lather and reapply three times with shaving oil.      I think I would really hate this product if I were using a cartridge razor - the hair and oil would really gunk up a multi-bladed cartridge.  With a safety razor, there&#x27;s no need to rinse at all until you&#x27;ve finished your shave unless you haven&#x27;t shaved in a couple weeks, but a cartridge razor would get clogged and need to be rinsed frequently.</li>
            <li> I am prone to razor bumps along my chin. Using this product by itself, I still got those bumps, even though the bumps were reduced by applying this product again as an after-shave.    But the best use of this product is as a first layer -- spread Shave Secret on your face, and then use a shaving cream on top of it (I like Proraso). This finally cured my razor bumps.</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive and very prone to irritation and razor burn.  I will do almost anything to avoid experiencing razor burn.  Shave Secret greatly reduces razor burn.  I shave with a Merkur 180 safety razor, Derby double edge blades, and Van Der Hagen Deluxe Shave Soap- no more than 3 times per week.  I experience less irritation and razor burn after using this product.  I use about 8-15 drops per shave.  First I wet my neck, then squirt a little bit of Shave Secret into a slightly wet hand, before applying it- to my neck.  After applying Shave Secret, I apply shave soap, with a Tweezerman shaving brush.  You won&#x27;t regret it!  :)</li>
            <li> Worst shave i ever had. my whiskers got clogged in my razor which i had to throw out. I finished shaving with my regular gel.</li>
            <li> It works well, slightly better than Crew shaving oil. Using 4-5 drops per shave is enough. Using a shaving gel or cream on top of oil helps, but not neccessary. Using more water is also helpful. I still would get an occasionaal abrasion, but it was a significant imrpovement, and now my preferred method. I like that it is both faster and less irritating than the normal shaving method. The container could be made more aesthetic (as you can see it resembles a glue from Home Depot or WalMart). I would recommend this product, especially if you have a sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Its okay and shaving with oil is definitely the way to go.  But I have been trying different shave oils over recent weeks and have made a discovery of a much much better shaving oil that is additionally quite good for your hair and skin.  Its &amp;#34;Africa&#x27;s Best Herbal Oil&amp;#34;.  This oil is just awesome for shaving as it is thinner and slicker and makes the shave so much quicker but really sticks to my skin and keeps me from breaking out keeping me moisturized for hours and hours after the shave.  Plus it only cost me $2 at Walmart for 8oz.  Dunno why its so expensive here on Amazon.  But its really really cheap at Walmart.  This Shave Secret is also cheaper at Walmart, $3.48 for the same bottle.  Previous to discovering Africa&#x27;s Herbal oil for shaving I was most happy with King of Shaves Kinexium.  WOW does it ever get you close with no irritation and fast too.  But the Africa&#x27;s Herbal does too for tons cheaper plus leaves me better moisturized than the Kinexium.  I hope this helps someone.</li>
            <li> Only a few drops make for the smoothest shave with the least preparation I have ever encountered. Most easy and efficient.</li>
            <li> I have used \\&quot;Shave Secret\\&quot; on and off for about 5 or 6 years. I use it mostly to shave my head. I shave several times with the grain and several times against the grain. I can truthfully say that  a super smooth baby skin scalp is the result. When you rub your hands over your scalp after shaving, it feels so extra smooth with no imperfections. I always wet my head and face first and then add 4 to 6 drops even though the directions say 3 to 4. My multiblade razor glides over the scalp with tremendous ease in both directions - with the grain and against the grain with no razor drag. I usually shave my head 2 to 3 times at one shaving and one of the advantages to this product is that you don&#x27;t need to put more oil on the scalp or face area, you just add more water. Another advantage is that because you only use several drops for each shave, the tiny bottle lasts a long time. At first, you might think that around $4.00 for such a small bottle is rather expensive, however, I find that this small bottle outlasts almost two of my aerosol shave gel cans which cost over $2.50 a piece, so in the long run the \\&quot;Shave Secret\\&quot; oil is actually less expensive. When I am totally finished the shave, I massage 3 to 4 drops of the oil into my freshly shaven head and face for a healthy shiny glow. Ever since I heard a hairstylist say this was her secret to the best head shave ever at a charity headshaving event, I was happy that I discovered this product. Having said that, I give the product 4 stars because of the following:  Because \\&quot;Shave Secret is crystal clear on the skin, you can&#x27;t tell by sight where you have shaved. This is especially a little intimidating when shaving your head.  My multiblade razor seems to get clogged with the oil and hair but it rinses out rather effortlessly.  The smell of the product is one of a menthol smell. I hate menthol smell. However, the smell does seem to disappear after a rather short time.  I don&#x27;t think this product produces any closer of a shavethan my favorite shaving gel - \\&quot;Nivea Shaving Gel for Sensitive Skin\\&quot;.  However it seems to be less expensive in the long run. Actually I am not sure the shave is any closer or that the oil just makes the skin feel smoother and softer.   Mainly if you can shave solely by feel and not by sight (because you can&#x27;t see where you have already shaved) and you don&#x27;t mind the menthol smell, this is a product that will give some of the smoothest feeling face and head shaves available.</li>
            <li> Short version of review....BUY Shave Secret.   I LOATHE shaving. I would rather chew on tin foil.  I cut and nick myself all the time no matter how careful I am. Even though I haven&#x27;t been to sea in a while, you would think I had just shaved in a Class 5 typhoon. Vampires follow me around hoping to get a free sample.  Ingrown hairs under my jawline that last for weeks.  Razor rash on my neck most of the day.  A guy can&#x27;t get any action when he&#x27;s all nicked up, with hair bumps and all rashy looking....I needed something to get some mojo back.  Until last week that is....  I cannot say enough good things about Shave Secret. It is inexpensive, easy to use, smells great, slightly spicy, but not overpowering. Pleasant and manly smelling. The chicks will dig it.  Did I mention easy to use?  Water, just a few drops of Shave Secret and that&#x27;s it. Just re-wet with water if needed. Simple, effective, and best of all, a GREAT SHAVE.  I am buying extra bottles to give to my friends for stocking stuffers for Christmas.  My days of buying shaving cream and gels are over.  And sorry, manufacturers of styptic pencils, I won&#x27;t need you anymore.....  The Secret is out.  Shave Secret is great.</li>
            <li> I like it but it takes a while to get used to.  I have used shaving creams for years and it is a different concept.  It seems like there is not enough on the skin but it works well.  When traveling, it takes up a lot less space and I cut myself less than with other products.</li>
            <li> I have to use more than recommended drops and still get drag. Once I get the appropriate amount 10-15 drops it works well. But it def takes way more than 5 drops</li>
            <li> I promise you one thing, use this stuff and you will never use shaving cream again, I bought this stuff a couple weeks ago and have used it 4 times, there is no way ill ever go back to my regular ways of shaving. You literally just apply it as the directions say and begin shaving! No need for preperation before hand and no need for post shave balm, I used to get the old boar brush out and use shave soap and use my trusty double edge safety razor, well now I use just my double edge safety razor and Shave Secret! That easy! Id recommend it to ANYONE</li>
            <li> Love the smell. This is not anti pimple cream, Nair or magic, like some people expect. It is an oil that with three drops does a better job than a hand full of the best shaving cream. Better how? It seems to allow the razor to cut the hair easier, little or no tugging. And lubricates the skin well to avoid razor burn. I am in the military and shave everyday. This is the best stuff I&#x27;ve come across. Amazon&#x27;s price is a little high, but hey, it is delivered to your door.</li>
            <li> This Oil is THE BEST !! Just a couple of drops does the job. No cuts. Just Smoothness !! I Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Not going back to creams or foam again.</li>
            <li> A little background... I shaved with a straight razor for a year and liked it, but the time it took for me to do a good job without threatening my own life was a bit much. Maybe after all my kids are out of the house, I can indulge in the luxury again. SO, I switched to a DE Safety Razor and found it to be a wonderful \\&quot;in-between\\&quot; of old-school charm, economy, and efficiency.  I typically shave with a soap, brush, and mug.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A friend of mine was traveling and ran out of shaving cream. He had Shave Secret recommended to him and then, in turn, told me about it. I travel internationally pretty regularly, so I am always looking for something simple, small, and good while on the road. So, I bought a bottle and tried it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WOW!  I was really impressed!  Not only did I get a close shave (following the instructions and tips for use on the back of the package), but the oil was easier to clean up after shaving, and left my skin feeling like I had put a balm on it... not greasy - I hate that feeling - but smooth. I could even shave \\&quot;up\\&quot; after shaving \\&quot;down\\&quot; without re-applying a second time. I don&#x27;t know how it would work with those 20-blade, high-tech, spring-loaded, razors made from unicorn horn and priced accordingly, but for the old-school DE Safety, it was very good.  And it doesn&#x27;t take much of the oil to shave!  I use just 6 drops, and have a rather large face. :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still prefer my soap, brush, and mug for everyday use, but when I am even more pressed for time - or when I am on the road, this is now my GO-TO shaving substance. I&#x27;m very impressed.  For the $, you should give it a shot.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t believe it, but this little bottle has changed the way I shave.  I liked it so much, I bought my Dad and my brother a bottle as a gift.  After a week, they both called me and swore this was the best product.  I have since used an entire bottle and purchased two more, so I don&#x27;t run out.  One little bottle lasts me 3 months, I have to use 5 drops, instead of the usual 3 drops per the instructions.  I no longer use shaving cream or after shave.  After shaving I no longer have irritation or need for after shave anymore!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  I have used it for about 3 years.  The first time was a sample I got in a Fun Run pack.  The thing is that 3 drops will barely cover 1 side so I use 10-15 drops for face and neck.  I use it in the shower and it works like a charm. I like the way it travels too, small enough to fit just about anywhere and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work that great with my waterproof electric, but I like that u can reactivate it by re-wetting your face.</li>
            <li> Nice basic oil to use for shaving. Nothing miraculous, but certainly makes less of a mess than shaving foam or gel. And 3-4 drops is really all you need. :)</li>
            <li> This stuff is AWESOME, you have to try it, you won&#x27;t believe much of a difference this makes shaving, especially if you shave your head!</li>
            <li> I really like this shave oil. I&#x27;m on the road quite a bit, and keep this in my toiletry bag. It&#x27;s easier than trying to pack shave cream, and, because it&#x27;s so small, it fits easily into a quart bag for ease at airport security check points. In addition to convenience, it provides a great shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After you shower, keep your face wet. Apply about 5 drops to you hand; rub your hands together and then massage the oil onto your face. Then you just shave as you normally would. Because this is an oil, rather than a cream, you&#x27;ll need to rinse out your razor more. Probably every pass down your face you&#x27;ll need to give it a quick rinse. Otherwise it will clog your razor. After I shave in the direction of the hair, I massage my face again (without adding any more oil) and shave against the grain for a really close shave. You never need to add more oil, but you may need a little water or to wet the razor more. When I&#x27;m done, I massage my face again and call it good. You don&#x27;t need aftershave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin, and this product has never been an issue. Plus, it smells great and feels good! This is a great product for anyone, especially if you travel a lot, or you are over the lather of the shave cream. Another perk is that this is all natural oils rather than a bunch of chemicals.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work for him but it works good on my legs if I use a hand razor.  Won&#x27;t reorder.</li>
            <li> As a recent convert to Proraso Pre-Shave I was interested in a   comparison.    Tried this under same shaving conditions as Proraso. The shave   was not bad; as I said it&#x27;s better than regular foam. However it   was distinctly a poor second. It did not clog the razor but I   found the Shave Secret difficult to rinse off my face.     Proraso gives a much smoother shave with no oily or gummy feeling.  Best thing for Shave Secret is its price.</li>
            <li> In looking for a close shave, thought I&#x27;d give this a try.  Used once and threw in the trash can.  Very oily and I did not care for the smell at all.  Did not feel like I got a shave any closer than with a can of foam.  It may have worked for others, but not for me.  I guess I got what I paid for.</li>
            <li> I have a sensitive neck area. Have used every and all sensitive cream available, this is hands down the best I have used. No burn, no nicks. I use is on my face and entire head daily as I shave my head daily (been going bald for years). Love it. Need four drops for my entire face and four drops for my entire head. One bottle lasts me a while.</li>
            <li> Works OK.  Can&#x27;t shave as close as with regular shaving cream.  A lot less messy than shaving cream though.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.  I used to get expensive shaving creams by Gilette and such that didn&#x27;t do their job.  I would be bleeding badly after shaving my mustache and beard.  Those folks need to be given a shave using their product to see how useless they are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I use shave secret, I would get really nice, close shaves with a mediocre shaver (3-blade) and would have very minor cuts if any.  This has revolutionized my shaving experience.  I bought mine at Walmart to avoid shipping costs.  Thanks for the tip Amazoners :)</li>
            <li> My husband says that this is not easy to use when he&#x27;s trying to shave his head with this electric shaver. I&#x27;ll try something else next time.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin. I also have issues with ingrown hairs and razor burn. I love this stuff. No more razor burn, bumps, or ingrown hairs. My husband has the worst razor burn on his face after shaving. This has made it so much better. I use more than the bottle recommends though. Definitely will buy again.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well, but it gunks up your razor pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> Works OK, but overhyped by Hannity, et al. Good soap shaves closer for me. I don&#x27;t like the smell or the skin feeling afterward.</li>
            <li> Pleasantly surprised that this works as well as it does. I can still get nicks and bumps if I&#x27;m not careful but this made a big difference on the quality of my shaves. I&#x27;ve always gotten razor burn with my shaves but not with this stuff.</li>
            <li> Dudes, and dudets, this right here...this stuff right here........ First of all, I&#x27;m a black guy. Yes, that means my facial hair grows like crud. It&#x27;s coarse, and curls. I used to wait two weeks between getting a haircut(using clippers and trimmers) just so the facial hairs were long enough, and straight enough(not curled back into pores - or at least broken back through the surface of the skin) to get a clean looking shave/haircut.&lt;br /&gt;NOT ANYMORE&lt;br /&gt;BLACK GUYS, if you&#x27;re corporate, or would just like to truly have that &#x27;fresh shaven&#x27; look 7 days a week, THIS IS IT. Everyone else, if a black guy with the genetically worst possible facial hair for daily shaving can look fresh everyday with this stuff, I KNOW DAMN WELL YOU CAN.&lt;br /&gt;I ONLY use clippers and trimmers, and a screen shaver to clean up facial hair at the very end. I have a &#x27;chin strap&#x27; beard, and so the clipper trimmer screen shaver combo allow me to have the sharpest line ups. It&#x27;s quite difficult for me to have sharp edges and lines on my beard and mustache with the wet razor route. I DON&#x27;T WET SHAVE AT ALL. Shave Secret instructions say to use 1-2 drops if using electric shaver. I used 2 drops at first, put in the palm of my DRY hand, spread around and applied to face. I then added a 3rd drop for safe measure, and boom. I proceeded to cut my hair, again with the clippers, trimmers, and the screen shaver at the end as usual. Truth be told, the trimmers glided so well over my face. I may not have even needed the screen shaver at the end, but I did it anyway, I think it picked up some hair still. But man oh man. Irritation? You know constant trimmer activity on the skin can be rough. Shave Secret knocked that down probably at least 90%!!!!&lt;br /&gt;FELLAS, I CAN LOOK CLEAN 7 DAYS A WEEK. PERIOD. NO PAIN. OH MY! I&#x27;M 29. I&#x27;ve been rocking a partial beard MOST of my freakin&#x27; adult life(by partial I mean looking quite &#x27;unkept&#x27; if you will), NEVER AGAIN!&lt;br /&gt;SHAVE SECRET IS THE S***. SENSOR ME IF YOU WANT. THUMBS UP!&lt;br /&gt;PS If you must go the wet razor route...shave secret DOES NOT MAKE BUBBLES, FOAM, SUDS ETC., ALL you would need is Shave Secret + Water, Period. You may be able to get a &#x27;barbershop&#x27; wet shave line up from the comfort of your bathroom sink with no cream etc. blocking your view of your mustache, beard, sideburn lines etc. I haven&#x27;t tried it, because again I go electric. However, I wouldn&#x27;t have ANY DOUBTS about it if the wet shave were my thing.</li>
            <li> I was pretty skeptical about this product at first, but after hearing about it for a while I decided to try it.  Following the directions, it works amazingly well.  I did have to adjust how often I rinse my blade, since the tiny spacing between modern blades makes it clog faster.  So I rinse in very hot running water after every swipe down my face, and that works most of the time.</li>
            <li> been using it for years, really smoothes out shaving</li>
            <li> Does not work like it is advertised. Not nearly lubricated enough.</li>
            <li> Great Price, Great Product! I pay a lot of attention to the process of getting a close comfortable shave and like most people I was skeptical of the claims made on the package for this product, but for four bucks I thought what the heck, I&#x27;ll give it a try. WOW! just a few drops and no need for shave cream or mug soap and you get a shave as smooth as glass with no irritation and no need to even rinse. I am sold. This stuff is gold.</li>
            <li> This product gives the best shave ever.&lt;br /&gt;It is not messy and smells good. Try it once and you&#x27;re not likely to go back to other shaving systems or creams.&lt;br /&gt;My one objection is the shipping cost, way too much!</li>
            <li> I initially tried this once without reading the instructions and wasn&#x27;t impressed. However, I was forced to use it a second time when I forgot my electric shaver and was away from home. I got a sample at an expo and thought I&#x27;d read the instructions and give it a try. Wow! was I impressed! I was able to shave over my chin without ripping out my porcupine bristles. To put this in perspective, If I went more than 2 days without using my electric razor I would then have to use my hair clippers to shave it down so I could use my electric shaver. This also works amazing on every, and I do mean every other area. I cycle/ swim/ run/ etc. Before I would have problems with bumps, ingrown hair, etc. No more do those unsightly bumps show up days later to wreak havoc. I can&#x27;t recommend this enough.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on outstanding reviews and yet I was still skeptical then... SHOCKED. This is no joke. It works. I&#x27;ve just had my closest scalp shave ever in the 5+ years I&#x27;ve been doing so.   As I mentioned, I&#x27;ve been shaving my head with a Mach3 for over 5 years now experimenting with different shave creams. I usually lather up real well so I can avoid cuts and irritation (I would still get cuts and irritation). So when the directions said to use three drops I was very hesitant but I still wanted to do it the directed way first. I shave in the shower with a fogless mirror so my head was already warm and wet. I massaged 3 drops into my head, got my Mach3 razor out (the lube strip was already eroded on it), placed it up to my scalp, took a deep breath and gulp and made my first stroke. I was already in a pre-flinch state so I was ready for what I thought would be a painful swipe. To my surprise, the razor glided right over my head! I was confused so I took another swipe, then another, then I started smiling, I may have even audibly laughed. It was sooo smooth! and when I touched my head I was dumbfounded that my skin was also so smooth!   I went with 3 more drops for the rest of my face and it went just as well. The only cuts I got were over previous razor bumps I had which was expected. But as for my head, it was cut free! That was this morning and for the rest of the day I would rub my hand across my smooth bald head and smile at the secret I had just discovered.</li>
            <li> Incredibly it works even better than advertised, Works Fantastic with my Electric Razor, I initially wet my face with water 3 times, put 2 drops of secret shave in my palms and rub them and then rub it on my shaving area wet my face 2 more times and then shave. I get an incredibly close smooth shave with no irritation</li>
            <li> Great product. Use with or without shave soap. Smells nice too!</li>
            <li> Great product. Makes a big difference.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic pre-shaving oil.  It is light and it spreads easily across the beard.  I use it daily.  This oil along with my &amp;#34;Art of Shaving&amp;#34; non-scented shaving soap (I use a brush) gives me the closest shaving consistently.  I do notice a major difference when I don&#x27;t use the oil.  My skin is dry when it is not used.  When used, after shaving it seems like I put skin lotion on my face.  it is not oily, but the skin feels hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;  This is great stuff!!  Highly Recommended!!!</li>
            <li> I have had the best shaves of my life with this product... Use some while shaving, with or without traditional shaving cream, and then use some afterwards as an aftershave, and you will have baby-smooth skin that people will notice.</li>
            <li> I no longer see the room spinning or see two of me in the mirror when I shave. I also no longer see red in the sink anymore. My neighbors finally stopped calling the police thinking I got murdered . Just kidding on that last one.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. But it takes more like 10-15 drops. Also it will soften the plastics in some razors.</li>
            <li> I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> Very good, protects the skin as it claims, no nicks or cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it can&#x27;t work by itself. You still need shave soap.</li>
            <li> aid electric razor without cutting skin</li>
            <li> This shave oil is getting a bit expensive but it is one of the best around. There are some other oils that are very good as well...American Crew, etc which may be a bit less cost per oz so check them out to.</li>
            <li> Not for me.  Smells nice though.  I tried with the recommended amount and felt like a dry shave.  Used more and it clogs the razor so bad you can&#x27;t use it ( and it will not rinse )</li>
            <li> The secret is to apply 3 - 6 drops on an already wet face with wet hands. After one beard reduction pass re-wet the entire face and do your second beard reduction pass if you wish. I can tell many of the unhappy users are applying to a dry face with dry hands. this product is non-comedogenic -- just be careful of what oils these products have. mineral or baby oil (which is scented mineral oil) are comedogenic which means they do block the pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this does have a mild oder and i am looking for an oil with a little stronger fragrence. any suggestions?</li>
            <li> I first saw this product at Walmart, then saw the reviews on this site giving it high marks.  I really was thinking I wanted a pre shave oil to apply before my choice cream, but also thought would be good for travel since it is so compact.  Since the Walmart is down the street from me I decided to purchase from there and not on here.  The price is inexpensive for how long this product will last you (only a few drops needed)and it does work fairly well as described.  However, I don&#x27;t think I will be using this product mostly due to the smell.  It has a distinct smell that is really hard to wash off.  My thoughts are old guy smell and I am 45.  At less than 3.50 give it a try.  Might not be as offensive to you as was to me, but I would feel self concious all day.....</li>
            <li> I have used this product over the past couple of years, and it is by far the best solution for getting a closer electric shave while minimizing irritation. One bottle has about 375 drops of oil in it, and you only need a couple of drops per shave. It has a mild, pleasant smell and if you use an electric shaver like I do, it keeps the mechanics of the shaver oiled as well. Overall, a great product that is good for your shaver and your face!</li>
            <li> Used it this morning in place of my regular shave soap.  Works great with the old-style double bladed safety razor I shave with.  I was concerned that my skin might be too oily afterwards, but after a rinse and a towel-dry it actually  felt soft and pleasant.  Feels a little weird while shaving, however I think I can adapt.  Will not be using my shave soap or brush anymore.</li>
            <li> This product does last forever, helps lubricate your skin, and smells great. I don&#x27;t really have any critique for it.</li>
            <li> Works just perfectly !!</li>
            <li> Just to let the general public know, this product really works!!! I shave my head and face with it, I use about 5 drops for my head and the same for my face. Now, here&#x27;s the great part, you can get this product at WalMart for $3.80 and that&#x27;s including tax!!!</li>
            <li> Works great!  I have been looking for an alternative to shaving cream and soap.  I used as directed and put 3 drops on my wet hands and rubbed it on my face. Didn&#x27;t feel like I had done anything, UNTIL I started to shave. WOW! smooth as silk and the closest most comfortable shave ever!&lt;br /&gt;The oil has a bit of an odor, not bad sort of like an old time barber shop.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I first tested this product out in a trial size my wife got after running a 1/2 marathon. I have to shave everyday for work and I used this oil and it at first worked excellent, especially for the sensitive neck area. I like the cool oil cooling sensation it leaves behind after shaving. BUTTT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions say 4-6 drops for men to shave. Well, it takes more like 10-12 drops. I really does give a nice clean cut that is smooth. I noticed tho that sometimes, it gives razor burn (It advertises that it wont give you razor burns). My wife used them on her legs and she did not like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, for the price I fell like i got my money worth. If you are a guy who only wants it for your face, 5 star rating. But over all, using it on face, legs, chest hair, 3 star</li>
            <li> I was sceptical while putting this on my face as it didnt seem that &amp;#34;slippery&amp;#34; at all.&lt;br /&gt;So i wasnt sure how smooth it would be for my straihgt edge.&lt;br /&gt;I was quite surprised how smooth skin felt during shave. I could mess up with the angle of the blade,&lt;br /&gt;as I am new to straigth shaving. This oil makes it a lot more forgivig toward those mistakes.&lt;br /&gt;After I was done not a single cut or knick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a believer baby! small, convenient, and it works beautifully. -Zack David</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan and user of Kiss My Face shave cream for over 6 years and on a whim bought this. I will never go back, I can use this daily with no shave burn and a closer shave.</li>
            <li> When I first tried this out, I was extremely skeptical. Even more so when I put the recommend 5 drops into my hands and spread it on. It looks and feels like you didn&#x27;t do anything. But then, when I splashed a little water on top and got out the razor, I was amazed by how easy, painless, and smooth the shave was. I am a total convert!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, this stuff does dramatically increase the amount of goopy buildup in your razor. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the product itself, or if it&#x27;s exfoliating off a lot of dead skin, or what. But I end up having to clean and change my blades more frequently. It&#x27;s worth the trade-off, in my opinion, though. Especially if you use a safety razor with straight razor blades (which are cheaper, and this stuff works great with).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For reference, I am a lady. I use this on my legs and bikini area, and it works great. TRY IT!</li>
            <li> My husband said that u have to use more than it says. He did like it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy or use this, unless you have a particular use or you&#x27;re Persian.  This is much like a product that you can find overseas, mostly in the middle east.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shave cream&#x27;s are light and fluffy and there&#x27;s a reason for that: you want to lift the hairs and not dull the razor.  this product works, but it fights both the lightweight lifting effect and the wear and tear on your razor.  Note some of the other comments, you have to push hard on the razor to get a clean shave, I think that&#x27;s mostly because the razor is dull after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason to use this product is if it reminds you of your trip to Petra, you need something super small for your travel bag, or you want to smell like cloves.  OTW, the modern shave creams are the way to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One last thing: if you use modern shave creams, use them *lightly* !! otherwise you don&#x27;t get the lifting effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;caio</li>
            <li> Wow, this stuff is really great. I apply it as directed but then I apply my shaving soap with a brush over the oil and that delivers a fantastic shave! Prevents nicks and cuts. Very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> It works, you get a close shave. It just seems like it&#x27;s a menthol baby oil.</li>
            <li> I have been using shave secret for a week, and so far I&#x27;m not all that happy with the results. First, I shave in the shower. The instructions say to rinse with very hot water. This may work for &amp;#34;sink shavers&amp;#34; but not so much for me. Also, it seems like my five o&#x27;clock shadow seems to arrive around lunchtime.</li>
            <li> SHAVE SECRET SHAVING OIL was purchased as a gift to save weight when traveling internationally. It arrived quickly and in good condition and was given to my husband. Love the idea and reviews. Hope he likes it.</li>
            <li> Beats the heck out of the foamy crap in a can. It literally only takes a few drops as long as you keep things wet. Yes, your cartridge razor will need a little more cleaning out. You shouldn&#x27;t be using one of those anymore!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite part is the post shave burn is gone. Yes, gone. I never realized it until one day a hit of cologne landed on my neck and after a dozen years of wincing from the burn.........there was nothing to wince from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My original bottle from the summer is just about to run out. More please!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving for over 20 years and I use a safety razor and shaving oil (I&#x27;ve used Gillette&#x27;s, shaving creams, etc.) and I have an extremely sensitive neck, I mean it usually looks like I shaved with a rock. This stuff has given me the most smooth shave I&#x27;ve had in years, I mean completely irritation free. I wish I had ordered more than one bottle and yes I will be buying more.</li>
            <li> Works very well with the Blade Buddy and worth the investment.  Only a few drops are needed with each use and will last a very long time.</li>
            <li> This is great but you need to put more than 3 drops. I used 6 to 9 drops to shave and it feels great and it helps to achieve supper close shave and you don&#x27;t even needs to wash your face after, just dry it with a towel and your skin feels great all day. I don&#x27;t think a fly can sit on your face after and they will fall :)</li>
            <li> May seem expensive but worth every penny because only a small amount gets used every time. I&#x27;m barely about to run out and I&#x27;ve been using this about every other day for the past 4 months. Definitely a bargain!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lubricates the skin and prevents cuts and razor burn way better than any shaving cream I&#x27;ve ever used. Plus it smells great and I&#x27;ve gotten several compliments from women after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t go wrong with this if you have sensitive skin and are looking for an alternative to shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About to order my second bottle.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband to try.  He ended up using more than the recommended dosage and it still was not very good.  He has gone back to his regular shave cream.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> It actually works. I have sensitive skin and have multiple products on the market from cheap to expensive all with similar results. I am usually disappointed and left with another product that I will not use. I found this based on other Amazon reviews and tried it and am truly impressed with the results. It provides a smooth, close shave even for sensitive skin after multiple days of shaving in a row. Based on how inexpensive this product is, if you have sensitive skin and have tried an failed everything else like me, it is worth a try.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother trying it.</li>
            <li> This oil is amazing! I don&#x27;t think people with a lot of hair will like it because you really have to massage your face with it. A problem with this is that it can be easily misused, you need to rub the oil on your face, and latter your face with water also. If there&#x27;s still a lot of resistance, then you need to latter it with more water, and not oil. The oil contains is tiny, but it lasts a very very long time, almost as long as a regular can of shaving cream.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome.  I&#x27;ve shaved with it three times so far.  The shaves were closer than with foam or gel.  Not only is there no skin irritation, my skin feels better than ever.  And the bottle is smaller.  So it&#x27;ll travel well.</li>
            <li> Works just as advertised and leaves my skin soft and smooth. I&#x27;m never going back to shaving cream.</li>
            <li> There is no secret to it it&#x27;s just a shaving oil instead of foam or gel, simple as that! It should be cheaper this little bottle is so small for the price you pay not worth it :(</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this in my 10k goodie bag. I had my super sensitive skin husband try it. He LOVES it. He has tried everything to not get razor burn. This is the only product he has used that works . This stuff is awesome and you need just a tiny amount.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bald man and shave my head each day. I have tried many products, but now I&#x27;m sold on shave secret. No messy foam and dryness of the skin. With shave secret it leaves the skin feeling great.</li>
            <li> Only pre shave oil I have used so I can&#x27;t compare it to anything else. Seems to work as advertised and allows me to see the edge of my beard.</li>
            <li> I am of mixed opionions of this product.  The scent is nice, it lubricates well, and it is compact which is handy for travel.  However, it does not keep my face hydrated, as well as regular shave cream.  The last part of my face shaved is typically dry when I get to shaving it.  Additionally, razor stubble gets clogged in multibladed razors which require more than rinsing for removal.  This however is not an issue with a DE or SE razors.</li>
            <li> I have been using Shave Secret for about 3 weeks.  Without question, I am getting the closest shave I have ever experienced!  It was a little unusual at first, as you use only 3-4 drops of the product mixed with a bit of water.  Having shaved with foam most of my life, it was strange not to load on foam at the start of the shave.  The razor just glides across your face, leaving behind an unbelievable smoothness.  I use a Gillette Mach 3 blade.  I like the scent of Shave Secret too.  I have a generally tough beard and could probably win a beard growing contest.  However, Shave Secret has tamed my beard--there is no way I would ever go back to foam or gel for shaving.  Count me in as a customer for life!</li>
            <li> Best product by far to enhance a Good Shave and head towards Exellence.  Use on a soft warm beard ( I shave in the shower) before applying  the shaving cream</li>
            <li> Oliveology shave oil is much easier to use and doesn&#x27;t destroy your razor like Shave Secret will.  This was the strangest oil I&#x27;ve ever used.  I know other reviews warned of needing to thoroughly rinse your blade frequently, but this was just silly.  I gave it a shot for a while, but not worth it in my opinion.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great. I use it on my head. After I get out of the shower I put 5 drops in my palms and rub in thoroughly on what is left of my hair and it works better than any shave cream or soap I&#x27;ve ever tried. It smells great and you don&#x27;t have to rinse anything off except your razor.</li>
            <li> It actually works!!! Great stuff, will be reorder as soon as I get close to running out.</li>
            <li> Yuck.  Use 99 cent shaving cream instead.</li>
            <li> But it did.  I use a double edge safety razor, and have a pretty strong beard.  I figured there was NO WAY this was going to replace my badger hair brush and colonel conk soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It easily could.  Three drops, mixed with water, on the area to be shaved -- amazing.  I couldn&#x27;t believe it.  Smooth, simple, and smells great.  I still got some irritation, but less than usual.  I recommend.</li>
            <li> I bought this purely on the strength of all the positive reviews posted here. I wish I hadn&#x27;t. From the descriptions I&#x27;ve read, I was expecting my razor to skim across my face like a hot iron on ice. Not so. In fact, I can&#x27;t discern much difference between using it and not using it. I&#x27;ve tried using it per the recommended number of drops. I&#x27;ve also tried using it with much more than that. Apart from a mild, pleasant aroma and a refreshing tingle, this does nothing for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t be buying more.</li>
            <li> I have tried nearly every cream, soap, lotion, razor, and shaving technique... Nothing has worked as well as this product.  I was extremely reluctant and became extremely pleased.  Will never use anything else.</li>
            <li> Just wanted to say, this very product and size can be had from Wally World for half the price!&lt;br /&gt;For my legs it works GREAT as a lubricant before applying just a little bit of &amp;#34;Kiss my Face&amp;#34; shave cream. My preferences and I&#x27;m sticking to &#x27;em. :)</li>
            <li> For those that haven&#x27;t used an oil shaver before, I highly recommend it.  While both creme and oil do the same thing (make your hair easier to cut, the difference is you don&#x27;t have to wash your entire face with water after using the oil.  This allows the essential oils to say on and nourish your skill after you have shaved.  And since you only need a few drops, the small bottle lasts a surprisingly long time (months).  Not everyone will prefer oil to creme, but I am sold.  Even when not in the field, I still use it at home.</li>
            <li> Seriously. This stuff has to be heaven sent or something. If you are going to spend money on anything for shaving you have to get this stuff. Stop buying shaving cream and all that, this little bottle is all you need. I have started using it and I get the clearest shave I have ever had, not to mention that it smells decent as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this item with http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008O82O7C/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_15 this razor due to the fact that it is a hell of a deal. I recommend anyone looking for and easier way to shave do the same. If you are a penny pincher like me you could go to your local walmart and buy this oil, they have it for around 3$, hopefully amazon will lower it to this price after I have submitted the request to them.</li>
            <li> I bought Shave Secret to use at the gym as it is small and takes very little space in my gym bag. The directions said to use 3 to 5 drops. My face was wet with hot water and I put four drops in my wet palms. I rubbed my palms together and apllied to my face by rubbing it I  thoroughly.  I thought this is doing nothing.  I put the razor to my face and viola the razor glided with zero friction. I usually nick my neck when I shave, but not when I shave with Shave Secret. Best stuff I&#x27;ve used in my 45 plus years of shaving.  I plan to include Shave Secret with gifts. You can shave sideburns straight as they are not hidden by shave cream. The downside is you can&#x27;t tell where you shaved, so you need to be structured in your shaving process. Shave Secret leaves your face soft and has a refreshing,  subtle aroma. Try Shave Secret you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to use it many times to get the benefits... I was able to feel the smoothness and enjoy it in first use.&lt;br /&gt;I maintain a french cut beard and I was looking for a clear shave solution so that I can shape my beard... this is better than a shave cream and allows me to shape my beard as there is no foam which covers my face.</li>
            <li> This is the best for shaving.&lt;br /&gt;No nicks no razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;However Walmart sells this product for $3 a bottle not the $7 here.</li>
            <li> Oh ya, this is by far the best for shaving. I use a low cost Silver Tone Double Edge Blade Razor Shaver w Nonslip Metal Handle (Amazon),  a razor from  this order 100 Wilkinson Sword Double Edge Safety Razor Blades (Amazon), and six drops Shave Secret Shaving Oil. Use the oil as the instructions say, rinse the blade often with hot water and keep the skin wet, the skin is moist not dry as with any soap or creme, I can just rinse and good to go. When I&#x27;m done I rinse the razor by opening it up some and that seems to help get the shave debris cleaned out, I can use the same razor multiple times. I&#x27;ve spent tons of money on razors, multi-blade razors, shave soaps, and shave cremes, what a waste of money and none of them gave me as close a shave as I now have for just pennies, I have been using the same bottle of Shave Secret for weeks, the next bottle I will place a date on it to see just how long it lasts. I bought my shave secret at Wal-mart, I think the cost was less too, but I&#x27;m glad to see it here too.</li>
            <li> love it. works very well . Tuff beard tender skin and blood thinners.  No more nicks no more bloody shirts. just read and follow the directions.(easy).! and it smells good.</li>
            <li> Very good product, nice shave, no nicks or cuts. Does gunk the razor up a bit though, but worth it for my exczema prone skin.</li>
            <li> smooth shave...skin feels like silk afterwards.  I don&#x27;t like the way it gums my razor, but it can be cleaned out.  Otherwise, a perfect shave.</li>
            <li> I have used this for about 7 years. You use it according to the instructions and it works. It&#x27;s especially good for shaving in the shower because there&#x27;s no lather to wash off. I like the smell.</li>
            <li> This product is quite good. I don&#x27;t know if it makes such a huge difference when shaving but it certainly helps and smells nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it with: Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood Shaving Cream Bowl, 5.3-Ounce&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest problem is that unless I shower my facial hair is coarse and hard to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what I started doing is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Quickly rinse my face with warm water&lt;br /&gt;2. Add 4-5 drops of Shave Secret in my wet palms&lt;br /&gt;3. Gently rub them together&lt;br /&gt;4. Apply on face&lt;br /&gt;5. Add shaving cream&lt;br /&gt;6. Shave&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works better than anything else I have tried and has significantly reduced after shave irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are thinking about it I&#x27;d say give it a try. It&#x27;s inexpensive and could save you.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different shave oils: Pacific All Natural ([[ASIN:B000FNEWL0 Pacific Shaving Company Natural Women]] various King of Shaves (including Kinexium, [[ASIN:B000FX88XS Kinexium advanced shaving King Shaves]] Alpha Oil, [[ASIN:B00027DH3S King Shaves Formula Alpha Shaving]] Alpha Gel, including blue and green types).  Shave Secret is my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions say to use 2 or 3 drops, and they&#x27;re spot on.  Other shave oils require more, which is fine; I don&#x27;t care if I need to use 3 drops or 10.  But just 3 drop of this stuff works better than any amount of any other shave oil, cream or gel that I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mind you, many others are okay.  The difference is not always dramatic.  But after having tried so many others, I came back to this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this is the only shave goo that makes me want to shave more often.  Every other product makes me avoid or postpone shaving because it&#x27;s uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would be sad if they ever stopped making it.</li>
            <li> I actually got a better shave from the Proraso pre-shave cream.  This product was OK but not better than the Proraso pre-shave.</li>
            <li> It is OK, didn&#x27;t really notice a difference. tried mixing it with my shave cream, and shave soap, tried using it alone. its OK.</li>
            <li> Well besides that I don&#x27;t like it and can not return it ! Yesterday I saw it for Half of what I paid  for at my local HEB ..Store in Austin Texas .. ! So not happy about that .. I will now have to check prices more often before I purchase ..</li>
            <li> So I was skeptical but I heard about this on a message board and decided to give it a try. I find it weird to not use any shave cream or anything else but it sure does a great job especially if you pair it with a good sharp razor.  It seems to live up well to its claims and I&#x27;m pleased with the purchase and will buy again. The only downside to shaving with oil is that I miss the visual aid of shave cream to know where I have shaved already. I&#x27;ve gotten better but the first few times I missed spots.  Also I do like a the light spicy-clovey scent.</li>
            <li> I se a straight razor and will never shave without Shave Secret.  I have never nicked myself nor received a closer shave when I use this product.</li>
            <li> The product description sounds so good I was tempted to order some.  I&#x27;m very glad I read through some of the reviews and Q &amp; A&#x27;s first though...I&#x27;m super allergic to eucalyptus.  There is no way I could use this product without suffering some serious consequences.  Too bad--it sounds great.  I&#x27;ll keep searching for a product that does not contain eucalyptus oils or by-products.  It&#x27;s too bad that the makers won&#x27;t just come out and list the base ingredients for those of us who may have sensitivities to them.  It makes us rely on other customers for this info.  Thanks to those of you who did list this info for those of us who need it.  It&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m trying to commit corporate espionage and steal their proprietary formula or anything--I just don&#x27;t want to go into anaphylactic shock from shaving oil!  My one star is based on the company&#x27;s lack of transparency regarding their product.  Then again, it is called &amp;#34;Shave Secret&amp;#34;...</li>
            <li> Got this for my FIL as he is really into shaving.  Great gift for any male!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product. I&#x27;m already on my thrid purchase, and one little bottle last a very lone time, much better than any shaving cream I&#x27;ve ever used. You can&#x27;t go wrong with the purchase of this product.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive sink and I decided to give this product a try.  It is the only shave oil I&#x27;ve tried, but it&#x27;s better than ANY shave foam I&#x27;ve used...period!  With foam my face always looked like I&#x27;d been in a cat fight.  Now if there&#x27;s any skin irritation it&#x27;s very little.  Because of how sensitive my skin has always been, I&#x27;d only shave twice a week.  Now I can shave more often.  I&#x27;ve also found that shaving with this oil allows me to use my razors longer before I have to change them out.  I&#x27;ve also found with this oil that even cheaper razors now give a very good shave.  (Give BiC Hybrid Advance 4 a try)&lt;br /&gt;There is a menthol smell to the product, but it&#x27;s not overpowering and I like it.</li>
            <li> Maybe I just have sensitive skin, but this doesn&#x27;t give me anywhere near enough lubrication for a shave.  I&#x27;ve used a dozen drops on each side of my face and it just doesn&#x27;t seem to work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also seems to interfere with the after-shave cream/moisturizer I use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used in combination with shaving cream, it&#x27;s okay I guess...but my shaving cream does just as well on its own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE:  I use a 6-blade razor, so maybe that&#x27;s the issue.  This product seems targeted at people using a straight or double-edged razor.</li>
            <li> For the price you can&#x27;t find a better shaving oil. Yes, you could pay a lot more.</li>
            <li> Being required by my job to shave every day takes a nasty toll on my skin. Often times I don&#x27;t have time to get a proper wet shave in with my cream, brush, and safety razor, so I&#x27;m reduced to using commercial shave gels and cartridge razors. Shave Secret helps reduce irritation by providing a nice oil buffer between hair and blade. Having course facial  hair I find this added barrier of lubrication very important and comfortable. You could almost shave with just this!</li>
            <li> I use this oil to edge up with a straight edge razor. It helps the razor glide against the skin and helps to provide a clean job.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great for both razors and electric razors. Smells good, feels good, and will make your skin feel great. I have very sensitive skin and most products will make my face breakout. This is one of the few products I can put on my face without having major pimple outbreak a few days later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It significantly reduces skin irrational resulting in less breakouts. It last a long time even though I use twice the recommended amount. When I use with a razor I apply it before my shaving cream. When used with an electric razor (wet/dry type) I use with nothing else.</li>
            <li> Not really convinced. I read several reviews and the product info prior to buying so I had high expectations. For me it doesn&#x27;t lubricate enough initially and does not re-wet after first pass. It has a heavy clove oil smell so I can only use prior to bath. Purchased another product recently (just to compare) and it works better and smells less.</li>
            <li> Much less irritation that using drugstore cream.  I no longer use shaving cream and will be buying this again again.</li>
            <li> One of the oils this shave oil includes is clove oil which is a natural, slight numbing agent.  So it works very well as a shave oil and after shave.  No more bumps or razor burns.  Even after sweating, when most after shaves have worn off, Shave Secret stops the salt in your sweat from irritating your skin, especially in the throat area.  Leaves skin feeling smooth and soft for at least 4 hours.  Use a few drops as an after shave also. The oil has a slight clove smell, but is not so strong that everyone smells it.  Is much better than the \\&quot;King of Shaves\\&quot; oil which i&#x27;ve also tried.  I began using Shave Secret because it is great for travel -- a single bottle replaces shave gel and after shave.  Then found it so good, that I use it even when not traveling.</li>
            <li> Got a free sample of shave secret at a marathon my girlfriend recently ran.   Figuring it was just a gimmick, I looked at the positive reviews on Amazon and decided to give it a try...    Holy cow.  This little tiny bottle of stuff works awesome!!!!  I shave with an electric, and normally would only shave ever week or so since I hate it so much- my skin takes a beating, never get it close enough on certain parts of my face under my jaw, and I start breaking out within a day or two.  Just a DROP OR TWO of this worked great, rubbed it into dry skin and proceeded to get the closest, most comfortable dry electric shave I&#x27;ve ever had.  No irritation, no breakout afterwards.  2 days later, I tried it again, only this time with a wet face, 4-5 drops total and re-wetting the electric razor.  Same results, only twice again as smooth with NO irritation at all.   Plus it&#x27;s a very mild pleasant smell, kind of a lemon/peppermint smell is the closest I can describe it.  Not overpowering at all, no old-man smell whatsoever.  I don&#x27;t know what kind of miracle snake oil is in this stuff but I can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s right under everyone&#x27;s nose at Walmart for a whopping $4 a bottle, and people are still buying all sorts of creams or goos or pre-electric liquids!      Wish I&#x27;d found out about this stuff 10 years ago. I might not have been so scruffy for so long!</li>
            <li> It feels moisturizing but it says to use before shave. When I do so, it clogs my razors</li>
            <li> All the other reviewers here are dead-on: this is an amazing product that really works!  Even though the instructions say to only use three drops I generally use five, and then put shaving cream over that (I have a very heavy beard).  The resulting shave is the smoothest, and closest, I&#x27;ve ever had in my life.  No nicks, no cuts, no irritation.  All for $3.99 a bottle (on average a bottle lasts me a few months).  If you try it you won&#x27;t go back.</li>
            <li> Good stuff! Don&#x27;t use more than a smidge, it works great. You get a smooth shave but some people may be put off because you don&#x27;t see the normally white cream disappear while the hair comes off.</li>
            <li> I bought this after getting a sample in a grab bag from a race I competed in. I have used a full bottle in a little over a. I shave both my head and face. I definitely found I had fewer nicks and it greatly reduced my razor burn. I still prep with hot water and a towel. I also found that putting water in the sink with a samll amount of hand soap and pre-rinsing the razor in said soapy water greatly helps with preventing oil/hair build up on the blade. You still have to rinse every two to three cutting strokes. (I use a double edge razor, not one those 3-5 blade contraptions that are marketing genius and an actual shaving abomination.) Aroma is pleasant and not over powering. If in a pinch I find I don&#x27;t need to use aftershave cream either. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Love this product, I use it exclusively for my third pass and it does wonders for against the grain shaving. Recommended!</li>
            <li> A wonderful product that gives you a closer shave without abrasion.</li>
            <li> I like the product, even though the shave is about the same as the gel I previously used, because of the additional benefits, as follow:  less messy, can use it w/ my wet/dry electric (2 drops), very compact bottle for travel in a toiletries bag and the container is clear, so that you can tell when it&#x27;s almost gone, something that you can&#x27;t do w/ a metal can. As a result, I will continue using it as long as it is made.</li>
            <li> Works well with a DE safety razor. I used this oil to shave both my head and face for  2 weeks without cuts or other incidents, and did not need to use shaving cream or anything else. My one complaint would be that the oil causes all of the hairs to accumulate and stick to the edge of your blade more than with shaving cream, thus requiring more frequent cleaning of the blade during shaving. but I am guessing that is the nature of the beast. This oil is especially useful for DE safety razor users who are traveling, as it eliminates the need to pack shave soap, shaving cream, badger brush, shave mug, and other safety razor accessories.</li>
            <li> I tried all types of the shaving cream and soap available in the market of USA and other country. I was also doing lot of experiment on it as my hair is very rough . I got this oil from Walmart at a very cheap rate $ 3.82 ( 0.67 OZ&#x3D; 18.7 ml). It is working excellent . The combination of this oil with Gillete Fusion Proglide ( 5 blade razor) is giving  very good result for tough beard.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I have not used shaving creme since I first tried this.  Wow.</li>
            <li> I agree with most of the negative comments.  I attempted to use as a pre-shave oil for my head.  The aroma isn&#x27;t very good.  The product didn&#x27;t really seem to help with the recommended number of drops, and adding more than the recommended number of drops led to my razor clogging.  I can&#x27;t imagine trying to use this as a lather replacement.</li>
            <li> After several bottles of Total Shaving Solution, a similar product, I decided to try something cheaper.  This is effective, and generally pleasantly scented.  With a lightly wet face, it works well with my electric shaver.  Haven&#x27;t tried a blade, but I&#x27;d expect similarly good results, as I noticed with TSS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The TSS product has a much better scent, not that this one is unpleasant, but in a direct comparison, I&#x27;d prefer TSS.  They both provide about the same shaving experience, and will last about the same length of time.  If $$ does it for you, then you&#x27;ll be happy with this one.</li>
            <li> I read one of the reviews, and the person was sorely disappointed because the razor dragged.  The instructions say to add water not lubricant to reduce drag.  I&#x27;ve used the product, and I think it works like a miracle.  I admit that I&#x27;ve tried to use it with a straight razor, but I don&#x27;t think it was meant to be used with a straight.  Shave Secret works fantastic with safety razors, and works so amazingly well, I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;m hooked on it.  But I will continue using my straight because I enjoy the ritual of using hot lather, etc.  But when I want to get somewhere quick and need a shave, I use Shave Secret.  It&#x27;s unbelievably fantastic.  I let my dad borrow Shave Secret, and he was amazed as well.</li>
            <li> ...I use this daily to shave as well as a moisturizer after my shave. I will continue to buy this product b/c it works.</li>
            <li> I used to have nicks and bleeding after shaving in the shower. After using this oil, I no longer cut myself. It also seems to prolong my blades sharpness.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first but after my first use I am a believer.  My face has never been so smooth after a shave.  I wish the product was a little more &amp;#34;Milky&amp;#34; in color so it would be easy to see where you already shaved.  But until you wash your face clean this Oiley stuff stays on your face even after you shaved.  so you can shave with the direction of hair growth.  Then in the same place against the hair growth for a completely smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work well by itself for shaving my beard but works like a charm as a base for shaving using my everyman jack shaving lotion.</li>
            <li> Eh, its alright, too much work to keep reapplying. If you ask me, I&#x27;d rather stick with the lather method.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any advantage to this over a shave cream.  I will use it as a lubricant for my blade buddy.</li>
            <li> My first experience with a shaving oil - I WILL NEVER USE SHAVING CREAM OR GEL AGAIN!!!!&lt;br /&gt;The closest, cleanest, nick free shave EVER.  Light scent, takes up virtually no space.  I&#x27;M SOLD!!!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. A few drops and some hot water and your golden. Four stars because of the size of the bottle; a larger size would make this product perfect.</li>
            <li> Shaving oil is a fast and convenient shaving aid. I use it in the shower as a substtue for brush and soap when time is a factor.</li>
            <li> I really hate their packaging and marketing. It&#x27;s like one of those TV infomercials, just screaming &amp;#34;BUY ME!!!&amp;#34; in the most awful 90s-kind of way. I would have never bought this because of their dumb packaging, but I got a free sample with some other purchase and gave it a try. I have to say, it worked great. I&#x27;ve been using shaving oils instead of cream for a long time, and this one is by far my favorite: you only need a few drops (literally) of this stuff for an amazing shave: just make sure to massage your face thoroughly before. Because you only need a few drops, it makes for a non-greasy shave. Works especially well with a safety razor.</li>
            <li> Great shave with this.........</li>
            <li> Nice to have a product do what it says it does. Works great in every region you need to shave.</li>
            <li> My husband swears by this product.  Makes his life more pleasant.</li>
            <li> Good stuff. Not great. Had to apply more than recommended amount to get the best shave our of it. Will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> It will work without water, but for me it works better with water.  Not really impressed with it.</li>
            <li> IF you use this correctly, it works wonders. I have super sensitive skin and this works great. But you have to follow the directions. You have to use a little more than they recommend, and it is expensive, which is the only reason I gave 4 instead of 5 stars. But as far as having the smoothest shave of my life, this is it! And unlike when I use regular shaving cream, the shave lasts longer than one day. In fact, I didn&#x27;t have to shave my legs for 3 days, which is unheard of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is expensive, and for that reason alone I wouldn&#x27;t take a star off. Obviously you know the price when you buy it. But I take the star off because there is really no way to use as little as they say. You still don&#x27;t use much, but going off the instructions didn&#x27;t work. Be sure to use plenty of water, and have super hot water to clean your razor with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I am pleased with it, and will likely buy it again. But the price will keep me from using JUST the oil. For swimsuit occassions, I will be keeping this handy though!</li>
            <li> I just started using SECRET shaving oil and I really like it.  It leaves my face smooth and comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback is the difficulty in replenishing the shaving oil.  Why is it sold in such small amounts? A three or five ounce bottle would be so much more practical.</li>
            <li> Currently using this along with a rather dull mach5 razor, still no skin irritation. This makes giving up my beard alright!</li>
            <li> Excellent transaction!  Product arrived promptly, as promised, and works like a charm!  thanks!</li>
            <li> I tried this and the first shave was good, but the shaves after that were terrible.  When I tried \\&quot;The Total Shaving Solution\\&quot;, it worked much better compared to Shave Secret.  I found out later from the makers of \\&quot;The Total Shaving Solution\\&quot;, (TTSS) that the inventor of Shave Secret used to work for TTSS.  I wonder where he got his formula from?  A little shady if you ask me!</li>
            <li> When you are traveling you need to pack lighter this is the product you need. it completely replaces shaving cream and the little bottle lasts for months</li>
            <li> Ok, I must admit that I was a bit skeptical of this product at first.  But, I said, what the heck?  It was cheap enough, if it doesn&#x27;t work!  Well, I was proved wrong!  This stuff really works!  As a lifetime user of both shaving gel and cream, I always had problems with scrapes, nicks and razor burns--after shaving.  But, after using this oil, my face was smooth, with no cuts, nicks or burns!  My next test is to shave with a not-brand new blade.  But, so far I am very pleased with this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Well, I finally tested this shaving oil with a used-once Gillette blade.  And, the result was still positive.  The trick, is to keep one&#x27;s face wet.  I used semi-hot water to keep my face wet and the blade glided over the stubbles with ease!  I am now a believer and can say good bye to nicks, cuts, and burns.  I would, however, still use my aftershave lotion.  My wife loves my smooth face!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving Shave Secret 4 stars but likely should have given it 5 but only because I&#x27;ve used it just once.  Like others I&#x27;ve picked this stuff up and put it down at Wal Mart several times due to its gimmicky look.  It doesn&#x27;t feel or seem like much is going on when you apply it but the shave I got is one of the best, closest, least irritating I may have ever had.  Not having a lather to kinda guide your progress feels sorta disorienting but it didn&#x27;t take long to get used to.  Actually it&#x27;s kinda nice not having all the lathery fuss and muss.</li>
            <li> I honestly wasn&#x27;t expecting much, but this gives me an effortless, smooth shave with a safety razor using feather blades.  I&#x27;ve retired my badger-hair brush and shaving soap for a few drops of this.  Fantastic product, and I&#x27;ll be ordering more when I run out.</li>
            <li> I visited the \\&quot;Art of Shaving\\&quot; and got new insights into how to shave and what makes a smooth shave. Never really thought about shaving as much before.&lt;br /&gt;It just so happened, in parallel, I got a \\&quot;Jack Black\\&quot; shaving creme, after shave etc. The shaving creme was incredible in that it gave me a closer shave than ever. It contained certain oils that made it do so. But, the tube is ~$30 and lasts less than a month.&lt;br /&gt;So I was out to look for a shaving option that provided a close shave and did not empty your wallet.&lt;br /&gt;The Shave Secret (Oil) did just that. It really does get you a close shave. Fragrance is just right.&lt;br /&gt;MORE IMPORTANTLY IT HAS PROLONGED THE LIFE OF MY RAZOR BLADE. I feel like I would have gone through 3 blades by now, in the time that I have used 1 with the Shave oil. Side benefit I did not expect.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product. Well done.</li>
            <li> The oil works well for me. It seems less viscous that the product I&#x27;d used before. Personally, I don&#x27;t care for the smell, but it&#x27;s a minor issue that doesn&#x27;t affect its functionality. I use it regularly, not only for travel.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t care for this product. Burns the face.</li>
            <li> This product is an EXCELLENT find for shaving areas like the face, underarms, etc. But for larger portions like the legs, I hope they come out with a bigger bottle. One problem with this oil when used on the legs is that you can&#x27;t see where there is no oil, so the shave is not as smooth. You can still get the job done - but more attention is needed. I found myself using more than the recommended drops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My boyfriend shaves his face EVERYDAY with this now, a close shave everytime. We ended up getting 2 more bottles because it is so cost-efficient and effective on the face. He had one complaint about it though - the menthol smell is a little strong if you&#x27;re using the product on the face - but the smell doesn&#x27;t last long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is worth trying atleast once.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awful. Barely feels like my face is wet, and I get cuts and razor burns aplenty. I loved the idea of carrying such a teeny tiny little bottle in my Dopp kit, but this stuff is No Good.</li>
            <li> I am always searching for the perfect shave. I have spent alot of money on various electric razors, shave creams and foams and various brands of razors and blades.  Having settled (for now) on the Fusion razor, I came across this oil, and it does everything that it claims to.  Four drops on a wet face give a real smooth effortless shave.  The clove scent is not overpowering, and the oil rinses off easily enough.  Check it out.</li>
            <li> This is the closest smoothest shave I have ever had. Will buy this again and again. I have sensative skin and tough beard this oil made shaving painless and smooth!</li>
            <li> Aside from many shaving creams and soaps, I&#x27;ve tried some oils and gels as well. This works well enough, although I prefer the Pacific Shaving Company&#x27;s version to this. I&#x27;m still a bigger fan of the aforementioned creams and soaps however, as I can more easily tell where I went over my face to reduce potential razor burn.</li>
            <li> My husband has sensitive skin and he says this is the best shaving solution he has ever felt! Excellent product.</li>
            <li> I would give this product 20 stars if I could!! I&#x27;ve been using it exclusively for 10 years now and I would never go back. Seriously, Shave Secret is the best. This is definitely a unisex product even though it is usually stocked with the men&#x27;s shaving items in stores. Ladies: give it a try! You won&#x27;t be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;A note for those who have mentioned the gunky razor issue: you can greatly reduce the gunk by exfoliating first -- I recently started using a hard-bristled body brush before hopping in the shower and have noticed a huge change. Additionally, this product works great with 2-blade disposables, which are cheap (I like Shick) and work wonders -- in my experience, they do a better job than the fancy (read: expensive) four- and five-blade ones.</li>
            <li> Given the name, I thought this was somewhat going to be a joke, but the rave reviews convinced me to try it out. I am a changed man! I&#x27;ve never used oils for shaving before this, only foam cream and gel. This oil is awesome! I use this in the shower with an electric shaver (Braun 7 series) and this stuff has given me the closest shave I&#x27;ve had in years. The eucalyptus smell is nice, not too strong, and fades fairly quickly, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about smelling like a plant. My face definitely feels much more moist with this over the foam or gel shave solutions. After shaving I use a couple more drops as an after-shave and I&#x27;m on my way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I generally shave every day, but after using this, the shave was so close I could actually skip shaving the next day. I have sensitive skin on my face/neck and have not had any irritation using this. BUY IT NOW!</li>
            <li> Why did I think that &amp;#34;3-5 drops&amp;#34; of essentially baby oil with cloves would &amp;#34;Dramatically reduce dry skin, rashes, nicks, cuts, ingrown hairs and shaving bumps&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;provide the most comfortable, smooth shave ever!&amp;#34;  Seriously?  Think about it.  And try this alternative first.  Wet your face, then apply THREE drops of baby oil.  See how far it gets you.  About as far as this will.  Save your money.</li>
            <li> My husband struggles with pulling when he shaves, especially when we travel and the water is so harsh.  Shave Secret is everything it promised to be!  No pulling, a close shave, and it smells wonderful.  I was VERY skeptical because it was so affordable, and I had heard it advertised on almost all of the talk radio shows I listen to...could it really be THAT good?  Well, it is!</li>
            <li> Shaving with this leaves me smoother than a baby&#x27;s butt.</li>
            <li> Great product. Best shave ever. Skin feels great after a shave, especially in the winter as the product helps with dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure if it has been mentioned, but using this product extends the life of a razor by a week so you not only save money by buying this product but you save money by extending the life of the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend you don&#x27;t use more than four drops. More just isn&#x27;t necessary and it will clog a multi-blade razor.</li>
            <li> I use it before my trimming and it does a wonderful job in reducing the irritation.</li>
            <li> Rather over rated doncha think!  Baby oil or Wesson oil would probably do the same thing.</li>
            <li> You simply apply a few drops to your hand and then rub it on your wet face before you shave with your blade razor.  I have not gotten any razor burn whatsoever nor have I shaved any faster. Do yourself a favor and try this product.  There is no rinsing required after your shave, simply wipe your face with a soft washcloth and let the oils stay and soak into your skin you will feel 30 years younger, I guess I&#x27;m giving my age away, ha ha.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several years now.  I shave my face and head.  My shaving ritual - rinse head &amp; face with hot water, apply shave secret, barbasol.  After shaving, finish with alum bar and and moisturize with coconut oil (don&#x27;t knock it! I have eczema - it&#x27;s very gentle, &amp; far cheaper and more luxurious than any after shave moisturizer out there!)  For me, this product is terrible as a stand alone shaving cream.  Where this product shines is as a pre-shave oil. You can feel the menthol, which is just right.  I found that the # of drops recommended to be too conservative.  I use 8 drops to shave my head and 6 drops to shave my face.  Even at that, this product lasts.  I definitely notice that razor burn occurs far less frequently.  In fact, I can&#x27;t even remember when I last had razor burn.  I recommend finishing your shave with an alum bar.  When I forget to use this oil, I definitely notice when I finish with the alum bar (it burns!) - so I do know this product isn&#x27;t crap.  It&#x27;s also a good practice to use the alum bar because it serves as a good indicator for when you need to replace your razor blade.  Try it!</li>
            <li> The only thing I use.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome!  Received a sample at a race and had to buy it.</li>
            <li> I do prefer this over regular shaving cream. It makes for a very close, nice smooth shave with VERY little irritation. I have very sensitive skin and I have virtually no skin irritation using this product. The only reason I did not give it the perfect 5 stars is that it can be a bit stubborn to get rid of out of your razor blades, but definitely not impossible. A nice bonus is I really like the smell of cloves that it leaves behind. Also, i you want to get a super close shave or want to &amp;#34;re-energize&amp;#34; the oil on your face, you do not use more oil. You simply wet down the area again with water and that area is freshly slick again. You use about 5 drops per shave.</li>
            <li> Absolutely phenomenal product, love it.  This stuff is fantastic for day to day shaving, no need to mess with a brush and soap.  A few drops in the hand and you&#x27;re good.  Been using the same bottle near daily for 6+ months, about to order more.  Give it a shot, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> I did not enjoy using this product at all. I found it in Target and thought it looked interesting. It claims to prevents nicks, cuts and ingrown hairs (which is all true, otherwise I would have given it just 1 star), but what they fail to mention is that it will not only do a very poor job of allowing you to remove ALL of your hair, it also ruins your razor! I used this product once and had to throw my brand new razor away because it had been all \\&quot;gunked\\&quot; up by the product and I wasn&#x27;t able to wash it off, even with soap. Also, I ended up having to re-shave using plain old shaving cream. Plus, I didn&#x27;t like the residue it left on my skin after I got out of the shower. I do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> allows for a good shave with electric razor and more useful than shaving cream. Mix with water and provides a nice shave and tingling feeling</li>
            <li> works great and smells pretty good too, i used a just a little more than the recommended 3-5 drops for the first time but after that everything was smooth.</li>
            <li> I first found this stuff in a goodie bag from a marathon.  I almost threw it out because it sounded so preposterous.  Hey, you can&#x27;t beat free though so I tried it out.  My first shave felt creepy, like Mac from \\&quot;The Predator\\&quot; dry-shaving; that&#x27;s what it looked like in the the mirror. It didn&#x27;t feel like that at all though.  Once I got used to what I was seeing, the shave went very smooth, felt good even.  I don&#x27;t like paying $9 for anything with ML in the volume description, but I&#x27;m pretty sure this amount (3 drops per shave) will outlast most of my other attempts at shaving foams/creams.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I bought this, as I thought that no small amount of oil would produce the smoothest shave ever. Even as I applied it to my skin I felt like this was going to be a scam. Once I felt the razor glide the first time down my face with no drag, I was speechless. For years I have had razor burn and irritation, and just this one small bottle ended that. I&#x27;d say its a little expensive, but well worth the cost in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband as a stocking stuffer for Christmas but decided to try it myself. I was super happy with the results. I was expecting it to feel like oil, but honestly I couldn&#x27;t tell I had anything on my skin at all. I just know I had no razor skip, got a really close shave, and my skin was very soft after. And the craziest part is I used a disposable razor because I was out of my refills for my premium brand. I always get a least a few nicks with a disposable and not nearly as good a shave as with the higher quality blades. I even shaved my bikini line with it and it worked perfectly (yes, I said I shaved my bikini with a disposable and NO bumps or skips). Enough said, right. I love that it&#x27;s natural too. I would totally recommend this to anyone. Works GREAT !!! I am never going back to shaving cream or gel, ever again!</li>
            <li> When I first bought this for my son, I had no idea if it was any good.  He loves it.  Gave it to my brother for Christmas and he loves it too.  They say it seems to help the razor rinse off better and last longer too.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a shaving solution for year to prevent ingrown hair and pimples.  Finally found one! I have had no skin issues since using shave secret. My beard is very thin, like a kid and i am 50 but shave secret works great. Highly recommend you try in. Great manly smell too.</li>
            <li> works as stated... will definitely purchas again!</li>
            <li> It is pretty good.  Not life changing.  If I have been good and shaving daily it is a nice shave and i would say it irritates a little less than most of the shaving gels I have used but not a big difference.  Conditioner is still my go to solution for when I have skipped a few days.  I softens up the hair so even a worn razor cuts through with ease.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe it. I had been doing DE razor shaving as a new hobby for two weeks and was burned every day doing every sure fire technique stated to stop it. was going to stop DE shaving my neck and go back to multi blades due to constant red bumps and burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this was last ditch effort&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;amazing hydrophilic polymer (I wish they listed ingredients to see if synthetic, I suspect it is) and I dont care if its made out of motor oil, it makes razor bumps stop. today was a test shave, I pressed harder than ever and it just came out smooth I cant believe this stuff did it. its a thick enough coating on the epidermis to prevent abrasion and its astringent qualities are all in one. but I didnt use it stand alone, I used it as a base coat to proraso regular soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;amazed I will always have to own this now.</li>
            <li> This does not work.  I bought it based on the large number of positive reviews.  Will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t really eliminate my getting a rash near my delicate area...lol.  Though I do have really sensitive skin, so it may work for you.  It does have a nice scent.</li>
            <li> Used this product for the first time this morning. It gave me the closest shave ever without any discomfort or razor burn. Now, what should I do with 5 cans of my former shave cream which I&#x27;ll not use again. As I travel frequently, the ShaveSecret will be very convenient!</li>
            <li> Surprisingly excellent product.</li>
            <li> I, like many others, had my doubts about this stuff. For years I was used to putting tons of lather on my face just to get a shave that was acceptable. Not even great. Just acceptable. And most of the time it was accompanied by a fair amount of razor burn. I decided to sacrifice the convenience and expense of cartridge razors in favor of a DE safety razor. The results were better but I just didn&#x27;t have the patience to take all the necessary steps to do it properly. I saw this while at Walmart, where you can score this for about half the price as it is hers, and figured it was worth a try. The packaging looks very gimmicky but if all I was losing was a few dollars I was willing to take the risk. I used this after a shower and followed the instructions on the package. I grabbed my razor, which is now the 4x from Dollar Shave Club, and reluctantly began shaving. To my amazement this stuff actually worked!!! I have heard of using oil under your shave cream/soap, but never by itself. I was convinced this would not work but I was totally wrong. I ended up with the closest shave I have ever gotten from any cartridge razor and practically zero razor burn. I was blown away. This stuff might not work for everyone and there will be guys who enjoy the experience of all the prepping lathering and all that stuff over this product. To each their own. But for me this stuff will remain in my shaving regimen. It gave me a great shave, was easy to use, did not clog up my razor, and left my skin free of irritation and feeling great. If I could change anything it would be the scent. I&#x27;m not crazy about the clove and menthol scent but it&#x27;s a small price to pay for such a great product. It really surprised me how effective it was. If you&#x27;re looking for an alternative to what you currently use because it just isn&#x27;t working you should give this a try. The stuff really is legit.</li>
            <li> Perfect for bikini line shaving!</li>
            <li> this is the second purchase for my husband.  He loves it.  A little goes a long way. He says it&#x27;s a smooth nick free shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Shave Secret for some time and will probably not go back to regular shaving cream.  It takes a little getting used to since there is no visible indication that it has been applied to one&#x27;s face.  I find I actually examine my shave more closely instead of just shaving off shaving cream.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long as I would expect when using only 4 drops at a time, though.</li>
            <li> This tiny bottle is full of the best idea ever. Priced correctly. Actually does what the package says. The fragrance is pleasant. If, used correctly with the razor you will not have regrets and your skin wont be damaged. Quality product.</li>
            <li> Use more than the bottle says! And unlike it says, it doesn&#x27;t replace shaving cream. But it works great underneath shaving cream. It says to use 3-5 drops. I need more like eight. I spread one or two at a time over small regions of my face/neck. I tend to get irritated shaves a lot, and this noticeably helps.</li>
            <li> This stuff works and is soooo much cheaper and better for you than ANY can of shave cream!! The best!</li>
            <li> This is the best space saver for your travel kit.  Works well and lasts a long time.  I still like the traditional shaving cream at home but have this in my travel kit.  I think it works as well as the shaving cream.</li>
            <li> omg best shave ever.  will not ever not shave without oil again.</li>
            <li> Excellent, everything said about it (good) was true. Hey...it works!</li>
            <li> I tried it today and am a big fan. No more razor burns and my skin feels really smooth. Following the directions, I got rid of my 2 day beard and it was ok. I had to rinse the razor couple of times.</li>
            <li> My husband it gave him the best shave ever.  We are going to be ordering more for family members.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this for traveling so I don&#x27;t have to carry bulky shaving cream bottles but ended up loving the it so much that I now use this daily for shaving. I use 3 drops for my face and it moisturizes in the process. Life long customer. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the strangest sensation shaving with this stuff.  Tried this on a lark and will likely keep with it.  It definitely cuts down on nicks and even let me run against the grain above my lip, which I&#x27;ve never been able to do in the past without a lot of digging and catching regardless of razor angle.  The one drawback is the remaining unshaven areas don&#x27;t stand out.  With soap, you can just mop the lather off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the flip side of that small negative, you can safely run your hand over your face to feel for those spots that have yet to reach the classic BBS state without smearing lather off.  Actually, I suspect running your wet hand over your face helps the process by keeping your skin damp as per instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a bit sad.  I liked my mug&amp;brush.  I&#x27;ll miss them, but I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll miss them enough to go back.</li>
            <li> I have been using this stuff for I think 4 years now (I first saw it at an MCX on base)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve NEVER gone back to any other shaving cream. I have tried MANY, in a desperate attempt to reduce razor rash, bumps AND get the closest shave possible to last all day.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know why this product isn&#x27;t more mainstream, it still seems pretty elusive. No one else know about it. Gotten some friends to try it, and they&#x27;re hooked!&lt;br /&gt;Yes, this is an OIL type thing, and gunks up your razor quicker. Rinse and tap, (hot water, stronger taps) not that difficult, fair trade for the good it does your face (scalp, legs, pits, nethers, whatever floats your goat.)&lt;br /&gt;I advise to trim hair first if it&#x27;s over a quarter inch or you&#x27;ll just be breaking your razors on the side of the sink&lt;br /&gt;One little bottle lasts about at least 3 months for me, shaving daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also laugh in the bumpy stubbly faces of all the foam users. They&#x27;re so lost and confused. They need help.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why shaving cream exists when this is so much better. Why did it take me so long to find this stuff? Easiest, smoothest shave without any razorburn. It also seems to have cured my ingrown hair problem. I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I bought this product after hearing about it on talk radio ads.&lt;br /&gt;I was interested in the idea that I don&#x27;t have to use messy shaving cream, and the easy clean up afterwards. (None.) Both of these are true.&lt;br /&gt;That said, I do not like this product. First, I have to use about three times the recommended amount of three drops. Second, this is one UNCOMFORTABLE shave. It feels like you are shaving with just water. OUCH! (Yes, I used a new razor and rinsed it often.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say I was pleasantly surprised that my skin  was not irritated, nor did it break out later. I fully expected it would, due to the rough shaving experience.&lt;br /&gt;After giving it four tries, I stored this in the back of the cabinet for unlikely emergencies.</li>
            <li> GREATEST PRODUCT I EVER USED FOR SHAVING</li>
            <li> This product is easy to use, works extremely well, provides an exceptionally close and comfortable shave and is very convenient to take on a trip because it is so small.  My only criticism is that it is difficult to clear the shaved particles from the razor.  You need to gently tap the razor on the sink under flowing water.  It takes time to do that.  I go back and forth between this product and my usual foam shaving cream.  If I&#x27;m not in a rush, I use this oil.  If you have sensitive skin, give this product a try.  This would be an unique Holiday gift.</li>
            <li> Christmas present win! My husband has to shave daily for his job and it gets painful, so I was so happy when he told me this works so well that he looks forward to shaving now.</li>
            <li> Works very well, I especially like it when I&#x27;m in a hurry. I can shave with a safety razor using just this oil without any problems. I have medium skin. I find it takes about 8 drops per shave and I just put it in my wet hands and apply it to my wet face. I haven&#x27;t noticed any residue. It doesn&#x27;t have much of an odor, maybe a little woody if anything. I also travel with it, since it takes no room at all.</li>
            <li> Was skeptical, but intrigued with the idea of not using messy shave cream. So far, Very good. Received a week ago and impressed. I have shaved at least once everyday. On two occasions, I was going out in the evening, and where I usually would not shave because of razor burn etc from frequently shaving. I gave it a shot, and no irritation at all. I have been using 3-4 drops. It takes getting used to because you don&#x27;t feel like you are putting enough \\&quot;stuff\\&quot; on your face, but it works. It also feels good after the shave, I guess from the menthol. Give it a shot!    01-30-15  Gets better and better. It seems the more you use it, the softer and better it feels. I have found myself looking forward to shaving to get the massage</li>
            <li> Fantastic shave! I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
            <li> Never going back to shave cream! Works great1</li>
            <li> A long time user of store bought razors with 2, 3 5, 6 razors with shave foam.  I&#x27;m a noob when it comes to DE razor and Oil and wanted to see what all the hoopla was about. So I purchased this Oil along with Edwin Jagger DE89Lbl  DE razor. I never knew my skin would feel so smooth and a razer cut so close. I threw my other Walmart razors and foam in the garbage &#x3D;). Very impressed and sorry it took me so long to see the light.</li>
            <li> This product is great if you have an old single blade razor.  When used with a Gillette Fusion 5 blade razor it is too oily and it gunks up and clogs the blades.  This happens with normal shaving cream as well but normal cream rinses easily off in the stream of water as you shave.  This does not rinse off easily  The smell is terrific.</li>
            <li> Oil and Water don&#x27;t mix.  I was scammed by Glenn Beck. I heard about this on his program. Shame on him for promoting such &amp;#34;snake oil&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> A noticeable difference!  I was skeptical,  but the proof is in the result,  and the result was quite pleasing.  Smoothest shave I can remember!</li>
            <li> This oil works exactly as they say.  I am a woman so shaving legs is a larger surface than a man&#x27;s face.  What I don&#x27;t like about the oil is that it clogs the blades...doesn&#x27;t rinse out very well.  But an oil rather than a cream does make the skin feel nice and prevents the irritation that often accompanies shaving.</li>
            <li> It helps but I&#x27;m not sure for the price it&#x27;s worth buying often</li>
            <li> Shave Secret has made shaving a lot better for me, a guy with sensitive skin who gets razor bumps frequently. I&#x27;ve tried electric razors and a variety of shave gels and creams, and I haven&#x27;t found anything that works as well as Shave Secret.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like other reviewers, I&#x27;ve found that my hair has a tendency to clog the multi-blade razors. An old toothbrush solves that problem rather quickly, and it isn&#x27;t enough to be that much of a hassle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this stuff, and it is the only product I use for shaving anymore. I was very happy to find it on the shelf of my local drugstore for the same price as Amazon, but with no shipping charges. (I hate it when shipping charges are more than the cost of a product.) Since Amazon doesn&#x27;t sell Shave Secret with Prime shipping, I found I can get a better deal locally than I can online, but your mileage may vary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One bottle also lasts me 2-3 months, depending on the frequency of my shaving. Try it. You&#x27;ll be amazed.</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff!I&#x27;ve been using an old style double edge razor for a few years now and have searched for the perfect shave for a while.This is the smoothest and most cut free ever and if you shave around a beard its a lot easier without cream covering the edges.Feels good too.</li>
            <li> I have been using a shaving Gel. It provides a smooth shave, but the Shave Secret shaving oil provides an even smoother and closer shave. If you never tried a shaving oil, I definetly recommend you try this product.</li>
            <li> I am a straight razor shaver and am always trying out new soaps and oils which will enhance the comfort of my shave. I ordered this product to see what it could do for me and whether or not it would add anything to my shaving experience. I am disappointed with this product for a number of reasons, but will mention some positives and negatives about it here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are certainly some positives for the product, and that is why I didn&#x27;t hate it. It does contain a small amount of menthol which I rather liked. It adds a much needed warming feel to the oil. I also like the fact that the oil is not heavily scented. Finally, I like the fact that it comes in a plastic squeeze bottle versus a glass bottle. The plastic squeeze bottle makes dispensing the oil very easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The negatives about this product were \\&quot;deal breakers\\&quot; for me. I actually tossed the bottle after using it for a week and a half. I don&#x27;t know what oils are used in the product, but I suspect that one of the oils may be mineral oil, which is highly viscous and becomes tacky when applied to my skin. After warming the oil in hot tap water, it was still far too thick after applying it to my face. As a matter of fact, I was using only 4 drops of the oil and even tried rubbing it in the palm of my hands to heat it up for application, but it was still too thick. What do I mean by \\&quot;too thick?\\&quot; If an oil causes the razor to drag, then it is way too thick. This oil caused my razor to drag horribly and that is not a good thing when using a straight razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another large problem I have with Shave Secret is that I could not use the oil by itself and get a good shave out of it. As I pointed out, it became tacky on my skin, which caused razor drag and also meant that I wasn&#x27;t getting a smooth shave. I used the oil on my final razor pass, without soap, and the oil caused more resistance than if I had dry shaved! I also tried using the oil with my shave soaps and the oil added nothing to the quality of my shave. Truth be told, my tallow shave soaps (such as Tabac) do a far superior job without Shave Secret and are much better than using this oil alone... by far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a long time wet shaver and straight razor user, I can&#x27;t recommend this product. More power to those who get some use out of it, but I recommend a good tallow shave soap over Shave Secret. Your face will thank you.</li>
            <li> smell is a little strong, but makes for a great shave, it&#x27;s like my face is teflon</li>
            <li> WORKS VERY WELL..NOT MESSY AT ALL</li>
            <li> Five days ago I purchased Shave Secret from a Wal Mart after hearing all the accolaids on the radio about it.  It cost me $3.82.  I followed the directions to the letter. I even read the instructions a total of 4 times.  I have been shaving for many years, and in fact I&#x27;ve prepped patients for surgery for a total of 10 years, and I have never found a product as misleading as this has been.  It was at best a wet, but dry shave.  It was as if the hair was being pulled out of my face, and I was using a new razor right out of the package.  My face was irritated,  I tried using yet another razor from a different new package I had, and no difference.  I think Shave Secret should be kept just that, a secret.  I&#x27;ve read plenty of the reviews  and I&#x27;m astonished from what I&#x27;ve read.  I have heard radio advertisements that rave about it, and I have come to a partial conclusion that the advertisers either have never used the product just to get paid for spreading the &amp;#34;GOOD NEWS&amp;#34; or have actually tried the product had little or no success with it, and continue to promote it because it pays the bills.  I have not discounted the notion that maybe I purchased part of a bad lot, but I am unwilling to pay yet another $3.82 for another.  On a good note, the bottle was small so I could take it to the gym without having a cumbersome can to carry around and I liked the fragrance of it.  I will not use the product to shave with, but I will more than likely keep the top off of the bottle and fragrant the room.</li>
            <li> Realy works as a shave gel.</li>
            <li> The closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had. I was skeptical but after seeing the reviews I decided to give it a try. It is a little weird to get used to after using a foam or a gel for so long. Once you menally get past it, it is great stuff. Just follow the directions and like it says, rewet your face (or whatever you are shaving) and go over it one more time.</li>
            <li> Works well...as advertised. A bit pricey though.</li>
            <li> When someone tells you a product is all that, chips, and the dip, most of us are skeptical. Well, go ahead, be skeptical because I&#x27;m telling you this is the best thing since sliced bread and black thread. I&#x27;ve been tweezing my facial hair and have the scars to prove how irritating this part of the transition to older womanhood has been. But... after learning (yes, I can still learn in my old age), that I should be shaving my chin and neck instead of plucking at it, I opted for the Shave Secret Shaving Oil that Amazon&#x27;s trusted customers were raving about. Thank God for reviews and reviewers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I tried it yesterday for the first time and I&#x27;m still amazed. My skin felt soooo smooth and soft and the shave was amazingly close (the first time!). It did so well, I also used it on the sides of my face and, again, I was pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, using oil does make the razor get a little gunky. But, I smartly purchased &amp;#34;Schick ST Disposable Razors with Aloe for Women, 12 Count Package&amp;#34; (only $6.88 as an Add-On Item), and was happy to find that they have this little tab you can push that helps clear the gunk away. It actually pushes the top blade down so that the hair, oil, shaving cream, etc... is forced out from between the blades. You just run it under the water and you&#x27;re good to go. So, there&#x27;s another nice product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> I have been using shaving cream for at least 20 years.  Over that time frame I began to notice dark spots or \\&quot;aging\\&quot; spots on my scalp.  At any rate, I decided to try this new product as an addition to dermatologist recommended cleansers and treatments.  Over the past several weeks I have seen the dark spots diminish.  I can honestly say this is the best shave I have ever had.  Hands down...</li>
            <li> Works surprisingly well with my Panasonic ELS63 shaver that can also be used with water.</li>
            <li> This product is all I use now for shaving, and I have converted several friends.</li>
            <li> Good Stuff.  Does a nice job and makes shaving with an electric razor much more efficient. Nice scent too. e</li>
            <li> ive got 24 guage wire growing out of my face that thinks its beard hair. it laughs at most razors and punishes me for shaving. this is the first stuff in 25 years of shaving that lets me get away without blood or bumps. been using for 6 months and still have about 20% of the first bottle left. hows that for value? im sold.</li>
            <li> Like so many others, I was introduced to Shave Secret in a race swag bag a couple of years back.  I still have the can of Edge Gel that was in my shower when I first used the Shave Secret.  I&#x27;ve not used a gel or cream since, and only keep it around in case I can&#x27;t convince a houseguest to try the oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shave every day, sometimes twice, and I have a blade-destroying beard.  I was going through a blade every three days or so before, and ALWAYS using a second application of traditional shave cream/gel and a second pass with the razor to get close enough not to cause stubble burn on my girl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, this Shave Secret allows me to cut right through it all on the first pass (yes, you have to rinse your razor after EVERY full stroke to keep it from jamming up), and leaves me remarkably smooth.  In addition, it&#x27;s not unusual to go a full two weeks on a blade. This is something gels and creams have NEVER been able to do for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus, my girl says she LOVES the way it smells.  That alone is a sale for me...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t know what the 2-3 percent of reviewers out here who lowballed the product are doing, or whether they have a special sensitivity to the ingredients, but I think the overwhelming positive response here should let you know this is a product not to be missed.</li>
            <li> Very dry, 4 drops is not enough.</li>
            <li> It does give a good enough shave (although not better than shaving gels or soap) but if you are a woman, as I am, and use it to shaves your legs, it is NOT economical. It takes 20 drops for one leg and at that rate you will run out in a few shaves. It is fantastic for travel, though, so I keep it in my travel kit along with the Venus Snap razor, and the combination is excellent. For regular home use, I will stick to the men&#x27;s shave soap and brush, which is much more economical than both this oil and all the shaving gels and creams out there.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no way you can use this with shaving cream. Putting this oil on your face creates a thick layer of oil and putting shaving cream on top doesn&#x27;t do anything. The shaving cream won&#x27;t even tough your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So now what? That means if you want to use this product, you have to use it by itself. First of all, the smell isn&#x27;t that pleasant. Smells like pine cones and some weird chemical mixed together, and I don&#x27;t mean that in a good way. Anyway, since it IS oil, good luck gripping your razor with a safe grip. Just running your fingers or hand under the tap won&#x27;t do you any good unless you use soap or whatever for a long while. Wasting more time during your shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And once you start shaving, you better hope you got a powerful faucet &#x27;cause this oil is STICKY AS HELL as won&#x27;t come off you razor just by running it under the tap. And this is coming from a guy who uses a safety razor. I can&#x27;t imagine what a pain this would be for someone using a multiblade disposable razor. It just adds gunk the first swipe and won&#x27;t be effective anymore. What a gip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So now you&#x27;re left with a not-even-half shaven face smelling like strong chemical pine cones and you think &amp;#34;should I apply more? should I rinse everything off and start over? should I try to add shaving cream?&amp;#34; NO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The simple answer is to not buy this product. Do what&#x27;s been proven to work: (1) spend at least 3 minutes prepping your face by applying warm (not hot) water to your cheeks and gently massage, (2) apply a lathery shaving cream (preferably not the ones in metal cans--just invest in a proper shaving CREAM and lather it up yourself with a badger brush geez. haven&#x27;t you waited long enough to do this already?), (3) shave with a safety/straight razor, (4) lightly rinse, apply more shaving cream, (5) shave again, (6) rinse with cool water, (7) apply aftershave if desired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s the secret. Not this oily, smelly, burdensome liquid.</li>
            <li> It really doesn&#x27;t work like the advertising claims.</li>
            <li> So far, my experience with Shave Secret Shaving Oil has been a good one. It is not messy and does leave my skin feeling soothed after a shave with an electric razor. I have been using this product for only a short while and can report back after a prolonged period of use.</li>
            <li> This stuff is for real!!! I hate shaving. My face was always a wreck after shaving with cuts and bumps, as if my face refused to cooperate! After the first use, it was like a miracle come true!</li>
            <li> I started shaving with a brush and traditional cream recently. The oil from &amp;#34;Art of Shaving&amp;#34; is way overpriced and this stuff works just as good.</li>
            <li> O.k. But not as.good as the commercials said.</li>
            <li> Super effective at helping to provide a comfortable shave. Nice scent (if you like clove spice) and a little goes a long way. A &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; if you suffer from dry, sensitive skin and an essential for newie westshavers.</li>
            <li> Too oily, it may seem to work because your skin naturally gets use to shaving and the bumps will no longer appear so this is really doing nothing. It doesn&#x27;t smell too nice either.</li>
            <li> Shaves well, but has too much menthol for me. Works in a pinch, but I prefer shave oils that don&#x27;t incorporate eye-stinging amounts of menthol.</li>
            <li> I just took up wet shaving, and was searching the web for pre-shave oils. I came across Shave Secret and could not believe that a $5 product could compete with pre-shave oils that cost $30 or more. But the price was right (and reviews incredible), so I decided to give it a try.Boy am I glad I did. Shave Secret combined with Proraso made for the best shave ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t like clove / menthol you may not like the smell, but SS goes on easy and the smell does not linger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely try this before you try a more expensive brand, it will be worth it.</li>
            <li> Not a good product and would not order this again. Not of good quality and not worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;Kevin T Maloney</li>
            <li> I tried the instructions several times and I do not get any good results with this. I even tried to apply 20 drops instead of 8 for shaving my head and it did not do much. Instead, my skin got very irritated from shaving. I will not use this product again. Much better just to apply a small amount of regular body lotion to shaving area followed by hot shaving foam. Works fine every time.</li>
            <li> I always had a problem getting a close shave. If I shaved with the grain, I&#x27;d have a 2 o&#x27;clock shadow. Against the grain would leave my skin bumpy &amp; irritated. Then I read about this stuff &amp; thought I&#x27;d give it a try &amp; it works great. You don&#x27;t need a large amount, so it lasts a long time despite its size &amp; it allows for a very close shave, both with &amp; against the grain of stubble. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I bought this at Walmart. I think its a waste of money. I won&#x27;t even try to use it as a pre-shave oil and put real lather over it. I do not think its a good product at all.</li>
            <li> Not gonna lie, I was nervous about trying this the first time I bought it. I am a woman struggling with PCOS, and shaving is literally the only thing that gets rid of the hair effectively. Having facial hair is something I&#x27;ve dealt with since puberty and this is the only thing that really keeps my skin from getting cut up.</li>
            <li> Husband at first found it confusing because he expected it to foam up, but once he discovered how little is used each time, he decided his face felt uniquely good.  It&#x27;s all he uses now.</li>
            <li> At least for me, it works ok if I use a lot more than 3 drops.  3-4 drops per side works best for me.  Anything less and it just feels like I am dry shaving.</li>
            <li> This replaces the creams and aftershave I previously used to shave. I can do multiple passes with this, without getting any kind of irritation.</li>
            <li> Definitely provides a closer, less irritating shave than most creams.  Has a nice menthol after effect which leaves your face feeling clean and refreshed.  Takes a bit of getting used to - goes on as an oil, of course, and tends to clog the razor (you need to rinse frequently with hot water).  Overall a nice product.</li>
            <li> putting steel to flash has always been a scary proposition for men throughout the ages. Some recommend olive oil to give a barrier of the skin to prevent cuts, shave secret takes that barrier and adds a clove sent, it that allows the blatant smoothly transit ones face easy and safely. I use the safety razor and have never got to cut. Pricey for the amount you get yet you only need a drop or two for your whole face it&#x27;ll work miracles, absolutely wonderful. I recommend for anyone but considering using a blades razor.</li>
            <li> The name seemed gimmicky but it really works. I always use it when traveling as it&#x27;s lightweight and just right, no need to bring shaving cream or aftershave. One thing, just need to get used to not seeing where it&#x27;s applied because there&#x27;s no foam. I also use a bit more than recommended even though I have a small face I&#x27;ll use maybe 7 drops. I use this with a DE razor and sometimes with a disposable if I need to travel light.</li>
            <li> First off, I buy this stuff at walmart for a little over $2. Secondly-it is great. I use a gilette fusion with this, and I tap the razor occasionally and use a nail brush to get the gunk out of the back when it builds up. the added hassle of cleaning the razor is worth the nice close shave. Make sure to follow the directions and add more water after adding the oil. You need very little oil.</li>
            <li> I only used two drops on my hair line and for the first time I didn&#x27;t carve myself up...not cuts, no blood, no nothing. Just used a couple quick swipes with my straight razor and the hair slid clean off. Very good with straight razors. High quality product.</li>
            <li> This is probably one of the worst marketed products on earth because it&#x27;s absolutely fantastic. With this you don&#x27;t need a big can of shaving cream, you don&#x27;t need badger brushes or special lotions. Just rub this on and go for the gold with your razor. Fantastic product. I carry a bottle in my travel bag and one in the medicine cabinet. I recommend you do the same.</li>
            <li> My Shave Gel works better and gives a cleaner shave with less iritation. This stuff might work ok for young faces, but not older wrinkled, dry faces like mine. It does smell good though!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve use this for over 20 years, with blade and electric razors. I&#x27;ve tried shaving cream a few times over the years just to prove to myself this is really as good as I think it is. After getting used to the oil, it feels like I shaved with a dull butcher knife.</li>
            <li> This works great if I shave every day. If I skip a day or 2, then it clogs up the razor too much and I have to revert to shaving cream.</li>
            <li> I use 5-7 drops of this as described in the instructions, but then I add a thin layer of normal shaving cream on top. I know it&#x27;s overkill but I do get the best / closest shaves of my life, and no longer fear cuts or scrapes. This tiny bottle will last me a very long time, great product!</li>
            <li> Some guys like the rugged, unshaven look when they&#x27;re bagging Zeds. I guess it goes with the whole \\&quot;post-apocalypse\\&quot; setting? Or maybe they think poppin&#x27; zombies in the head with a Glock 20 at 50 yards isn&#x27;t manly enough unless you have 5 o&#x27;clock shadow?    Whatever. Those other Breathers can do what they want. Me? I like to take out Roamers with a smooth, clean face.    But when you&#x27;re in the field, you don&#x27;t have hot water, a badger brush, and your great grandpa&#x27;s pewter shaving mug, do you? Sometimes you gotta make do with a mirror (small, steel), a half-empty bottle of water, and a straight edge! Well, that&#x27;s all you NEED with Shave Secret, brother!    A splash of water in your hands and a few drops of Shave Secret rubbed into the skin and you&#x27;re ready to slice off some whiskers!    \\&quot;It cloooogs my raaaazor,\\&quot; they whine! Who the hell takes a Gillette Mach-1 into the bush?  Can you cut a zombie&#x27;s head off with a disposable razor??? NO!! So toss that crap and get yourself a good, quality straight razor! You&#x27;ll never whine again about clogged blades! And, in a pinch, you can use it to cut off that meat bag&#x27;s hand when it grabs you through the fence and tries to pull you in for a quick bite. Be sure and clean your blade with a moist towelette before your next shave, though, OK?    The awesome clover scent is very earthy and clean - just the thing you want to smell when you put a Rotter down for the count! That amazing tingling feeling I get as I rub the lotion on the skin means I&#x27;ll NEVER get the hose again! And that little bottle packs away so easily in your bugout bag you won&#x27;t even notice it&#x27;s there. But when you&#x27;re taking a break from bustin&#x27; slackjaws and need to freshen up before makin&#x27; a scavenge run into the WalMart, you&#x27;ll damn well be happy you have it! In just five minutes, you can be stubble-free and rarin&#x27; to go kill some shufflers.    So the next time you&#x27;re stocking up on ammo and MREs, don&#x27;t forget to pick up a little bottle of Shave Secret.  It could save your life.*    *OK, I don&#x27;t really know about that.  But at least it can make you look good when you&#x27;re killing zombies.    Peace.</li>
            <li> Tried a bunch of shaving oils using my safety razor. This stuff has probably been the best I&#x27;ve tried. Used it as a pre shave oil and a stand alone shave oil. Works great both ways. Used it as a post shave a couple of times works great like that too. Amazon price seems a little steep. Got mine at Walmart for around $3. Definitely getting this again</li>
            <li> my husband loves this stuff, it is pretty amazing how long a bottle lasts him (couple months..)</li>
            <li> For all of you who are reading these reviews in an attempt to make up your mind about this purchase: Please read on...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is exactly what is says it is, no more, no less. It was delivered quickly and was packaged flawlessly. As a collector of shaving razors and avid wet shaver I am always excited to try new products. I purchased this knowing that it violated the tradition and rituals of a good wet shave (alright, perhaps I purchased this with some reservations), but I wanted to try it anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In preparation, I wet my palms with some warm water and shook-off the excess, applied 3 drops (the recommended amount) and worked my palms together.  The feeling of this product was more aqueous that it was unctuous; being oil I guess i expected a bit more slipperiness. I applied to my face and worked the product in. With the first pass of the blade I could feel the pull of every hair as the razor passed across my cheek...alright, stop, reassess...the product states if you require more lubrication to apply more water rather than product....more water: check...the next pass of the razor was even worse...alright, stop again, reassess....I applied two more drops and went in for a third attempt. NOPE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can only assume that this product was designed to lubricate the hair follicle with oil so they pull from your face easier with each pass of the razor because it surely didn&#x27;t provide any glide to the blade as it passed on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I try not to be so closed minded about products, as such, I will give this product another try this week but hold out little hope for it. In all honesty I can see this product working well if you shave every single day and your facial hair is very fine but if your facial stubble feels like 60 Grit sandpaper perhaps this product isn&#x27;t for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When all was said and done, I wasn&#x27;t very impressed by this product. On a positive note this product smells great; clove is certainly a good winter scent.</li>
            <li> I like the smell....kind of like old spice.</li>
            <li> Tough to put into words how much this secret oil has changed my mornings. I have a very strong neck beard area, and normal shaving cream left it irritated and still hairy. This product saves time, blood (literally), water &amp; razors. A must-buy for any of my fellow neck-beard compatriots out there.</li>
            <li> I saw this at Walmart and decided to try it after reading the Amazon reviews. I use a double edge Merkur razor with Feather Stainless blades and Shave Secret does what it promises and it smells great, too. Using 4 drops of oil, the blade simply glides over the skin. And I like the way it leaves my skin afterwards without the need to rinse my face.  I have a small bump just above the lip which is always getting nicked, but not with this oil. Be forewarned, what other reviewers say about clogging the razor is true. You need to rinse the razor after each stroke or it will clog and be difficult to clean.  I also re-wet the skin every so often as the instructions suggest. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 1 week, so I&#x27;m curious to see how long that little bottle will last. I will certainly buy it again.</li>
            <li> OK, I would not have been a believer but was given a sample in my goody bag after a recent 10K run. Actually, I had received this product in several goody bags after runs but always tossed it away (now I regret that!). This time, I used the sample, was so impressed that I ordered a bottle. It really DOES give me a closer shave that does seem to last longer. Nothing feels worse picky legs when you crawl into bed. Well, OK, I can think of some things that would be worse, but picky legs still makes the list.</li>
            <li> I received Shave Secret as a gift and was hesitant to shave with a new product.  I shave my head and face so razor rash and missed spots are not an option.  I used over the recommended amount because I couldn&#x27;t believe three drops would suffice.  To my surprise Shave Secret cut my shaving time in half.  There were no missed spots and I had the closest shave ever.  I am finished with shave creams.  Shave Secret gets my business from now on.</li>
            <li> works great.could&#x27;nt believe how good it works. Best shave ever.</li>
            <li> Does Not shave off as easily as described, does leave face feeling good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mike B</li>
            <li> I think it may shave a little better than shaving cream. It is marginally better than plain baby oil, and it occupies little space in your toilet kit. Downsides are that it is not easy to see where you have shaved, and you must rinse the razor frequently in hot water or the oil and hair mixture turn into a solid that blocks the razor.</li>
            <li> Nice for pre-shave. Adds a nice cooling layer of lubrication. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s really a secret though, if it were I wouldn&#x27;t have been able to buy it.</li>
            <li> Awesome!!  I am a fan for life!</li>
            <li> Alright, I have a coarse beard.  I remember seeing my Dad&#x27;s whiskers and unshaven beard after a week of canadian fishing and thinking \\&quot;Wow that looks like white sandpaper on his face!\\&quot;  When I started shaving I thought it was the manliest thing to shave my face every day.  I mentioned that to my Dad and he said \\&quot;Just wait, you will grow to hate it, ha ha!\\&quot;  Fast Forward 20 years and he was right.  I inherited a fast growing coarse beard that just gets more difficult to shave as I age.  Shaving is a chore and I usually leave several bleeding knicks on my face from applying too much pressure. I tried the range of shaving creams from  cheap barbasol to expensive shaving creams (like american crew, jack black, even king of shaves silicone stuff).  Nothing worked, until this little generic looking \\&quot;I made this in my garage in the 1950&#x27;s\\&quot; bottle of \\&quot;shave secret\\&quot;. It has completely revolutionized my shaving experience.  I get smooth, close shaves without any knicking.  I don&#x27;t have to apply extra pressure on the blade.  It lasts a long time, even though I use more than three drops.  I tend to use a couple of drops on each section of my beard area. It also makes the blades I use last longer.  Another benefit is that I can easily see my stubble in case i missed an area.  I also need to apply once, without having to re-apply like shaving cream when I need to go over an area again.</li>
            <li> Ive used shaving (talc) powder sticks for 20 years with a norelco shaver and now I switched to a panasonic 4 bar blades and I tried the oil stuff to see if it is better. the oil makes the face soft and it shaves great but you need alot of drops and you have to keep your face wet all throughout shave. Then you have to wash the oil off your hands at the end. the shave powder is just easier to apply and clean up. Enjoy!</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed using this product at first. I used it as a pre-shave oil, and would let it sit in warm water on my face for a few minutes. Then I would apply shave lather and shave perfect. After a few weeks I noticed more acne than normal. I&#x27;m not a dermatologist, but I stopped using this product and went back to normal. Also it changed color after a few days of being open? (to a brighter yellow.)</li>
            <li> Heavy stubble practically falls off like butter.  I ordered two more bottles and gave them to friends.  Really great stuff!</li>
            <li> My husband loves this to shave with. He has folliculitis and very curly hair, and even after some prescriptions and plenty of other products, this is his favorite and gives him the closest shave with the least ingrown hairs after.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 61 years old, started shaving when I was 16. This shave oil is the BEST I EVER USED!!!</li>
            <li> I use the grooming lounge shave oil but decided to try this for travel,  wow,  this works great.  I use it with shave cream to get an amazing shave with no nicks or cuts,  very smooth shave.  You cant beat it for the price.  I bought 2 and use more than the recommended amount.  You will not regret buying this.</li>
            <li> Item arrived on time and as described by seller.  This stuff just works .... and smells much better than 20 weight. &#x27;) It fits the bill perfectly.  Another satisfied customer, and one who&#x27;ll return.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. I enjoy using different high end shaving lathers with a boars hair brush, and did not figure this stuff would be comparable, but actually find it to be the best I&#x27;ve used, even over some of those $30 per container products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also tried using this a pre-shave and using the lather over it. There is no point in it, it works better on it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li> Smells a bit like cloves, that&#x27;s my only small gripe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over than that, this stuff makes a world of a difference in the world of shaving!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Add a few drops and a few drops of water to area  Shave. Less redness and bumps. Less ingrown hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No shave cream necessary. A little lasts a long time, very little needed. No clogged up razors. Hooray! Smile. Thanks!!</li>
            <li> I would give a zero if I could. A friend suggested a popular, but more expensive pre-shave oil that is about $22-$25 per bottle. I saw that this one was cheaper and gave it a try first due to the positive reviews. That was a mistake. They got my $7. Whether 3 drops/5 drops/15 drops, more water/less water.... this stuff does nothing. No benefit whatsover. I find myself doubting many of those positive reviews and whether some may have a vested interest. This product definitely seems like a marketing scam. Worse, this stuff smells like the chain lube that I use on my bicycle. Stay away. Just use a good safety razor, badger brush, quality cream/soap, and a good after-shave balm. That&#x27;s my secret. This product is no secret.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just OK.. I like the dry shave stick a little better as this seems to not run as smooth over the face.</li>
            <li> works surprisingly well and in small amounts ..i will continue to use it from this point on ..good product .. glad i discovered it ..</li>
            <li> Best shaving gel ever!! My only question is  why has Shave Secret been a secret??</li>
            <li> NOT A SECRET ANYMORE . . . . . recommended this potion to all my male friends. Still don&#x27;t understand how 3 drops of this oil can go such a long way in one shave compared to regular shaving gels or creams that I&#x27;ve used in the past. Initially I was suspicious to purchase and try this product as I thought it was just another rip off. Thankfully, it was the total opposite when I first used it. Its lasting really long especially since I shave every other day. Good job with this product! Going to spread the word even more!</li>
            <li> I would rate this zero if I could.  I have never had so many cuts on my face in my life.  Tried with several different razors.  This stuff did nothing but gunk up my razor and was very hard to even get off my skin afterwards. DO NOT BUY THIS. WASTE OF $.  Also I followed all of the directions and even looked at reviews to see if I was doing something wrong. I was not.  This is just a bad product, much better to use just olive oil.</li>
            <li> This stuff gave me the smoothest shave of my life with no razor burn or nicks. The menthol also gives a cooling sensation which feels GREAT. I dont even have to use aftershave. I use this with a DE razor with Feather blades (incredibly sharp).</li>
            <li> All I can say is wow. I have never shaved my face and not gotten razor burn the next day, until today. I shaved yesterday after I got my package from Amazon. I could feel how different my skin was as I was shaving. Wet your face and add 3 drops to a wet palm, BAM! The most comfortable shave I have ever had with a razor. Just make sure you keep adding water back to your face or area, and you are washing out the razor under a Hot Tap. Thanks for sharing the Secret, you have found a customer for life.</li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim at a big box store for my travel kit. About the size of a bottle of eye drops, Shave Secret is a compact, lightweight and economical alternative to toting around a big old metal can of traditional shaving cream in a toiletry bag. I&#x27;ve been so pleased with the shave, moisturizing and natural fragrance of this product I&#x27;ll probably ditch the cans of sensitive-skin shaving gel that I&#x27;ve used for years. According to the manufacturer&#x27;s website, if you experience razor drag add more water, not more product.</li>
            <li> I used this for awhile until I realized baby oil works just as well.  Has a real cool interesting smell.  Won&#x27;t buy again but wouldn&#x27;t give it a bad review.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything for my razor-burn...</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this product but decided to try it anyway.  Unbelievable!  It works exactly as described and my skin feels amazingly smooth and closely shaven.</li>
            <li> This stuff works well and allows you to see what you are shaving much better than lathered cream.  I&#x27;m happy I tried it....now I&#x27;m sticking with it !</li>
            <li> You use this WITH shaving soap or cream not instead of. It&#x27;s not as good as the Art of Shaving oil, but it&#x27;s still very good and it will help your shave.</li>
            <li> It works better on some days than others.  It always keeps my face from feeling sore, but the shave closeness varies.  It is as though it is more viscous some days than others.</li>
            <li> Gave it as a gift, my friend loved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good product, soft and smooth, at least that&#x27;s what i was told.</li>
            <li> The stuff works, gives a cool fresh feeling after the shave. But I give it 3 stars because the oil clogs the razor blade, I use a fusion and hydro 5, both clog up to the point I used an old toothbrush to clean them out.  Other than that the product works well.</li>
            <li> The stuff does a great job from a shaving software standpoint.  The thing I don&#x27;t like about it is the greasy feeling that it leaves on my face.  I&#x27;ve used other similar preparations ( shavingsauce.com ) premium shaving oil that works as well without the greasy after feeling. I much prefer these types of shaving oils to foamy lathers.</li>
            <li> great  the best shave i ever had.</li>
            <li> I much prefer this product to typical shaving creams in a can. I got an excellent shave, it&#x27;s not as messy as a can of shaving cream, plus it&#x27;s small and great for travel. When I first saw it, I thought it would be great for travel, but now I use it all the time. My face feels smoother afterwards too, as it&#x27;s an oil. It does take me more than the advertised 3 drops, but maybe that&#x27;s just me.</li>
            <li> The product it&#x27;s great, leaves your skin smooth and no irriting I use at shower everything datos since I recibe</li>
            <li> After shaving with high quality electric razors for more years than I care to admit, I decided to switch to a double edge safety razor like my Dad used to use.  The shave was much closer but it always seemed like something was missing.  This past Christmas my lovely and gracious wife gave me a shave kit that included a small bottle of shave oil.  I loved it, but was very disappointed to find it was well over $25 dollars to order more when the tiny sample bottle ran out.  After hearing several Shave Secret commercials on some of my favorite talk radio shows, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try - especially since it is SO much more economical than higher-priced shave oil.  I&#x27;m very impressed by Shave Secret.  Although it is not as &amp;#34;thick&amp;#34; as the oil I had been using, buying a bottle for $7 as opposed to $25 or more was attractive to me and I&#x27;m very happy with my decision to try it.  After wetting my face I drop four or five drops of Shave Secret in one hand, rub both hands together, then rub it into my beard.  After letting it set for about thirty second I shave with nary a nick or cut.  If I begin feeling a little drag on the razor, I add a little more water to my face and the drag just disappears.  When I&#x27;m done shaving I simply towel my face dry (Shave Secret is also a great moisturizer so don&#x27;t rinse it off).  The reason for four stars - Shave Secret is a little thinner than the $25 shave oil, which requires using a couple more drops.  Not a huge deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inexpensive plus high quality adds up to a very good value for this frugal Scottsman.</li>
            <li> Really like it for blade shaving in the shower.  Best if you use some soap with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works with my electric shaver too.  But difference isn&#x27;t quite as noticeable as it is with a blade shaver.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried some expensive shave creams in the past in addition to a few pre-shave oils. This product makes the whole shaving process insanely easy with zero irritation and is very compact which makes it convenient to travel with.</li>
            <li> I found that it is great to use along with the shaving gel I normally use. Put a small amount of the Shave Secret Saving Oil and then put the saving gel. It makes shaving a lot smoother. Don&#x27;t recommend it alone since the product is very concentrated and oily and the hairs that are shaved stick on the razor and becomes really annoying.</li>
            <li> Great product. Couple tips...Best results if your a regular daily shaver. I skipped a day on a weekend and when I shaved the next day I noticed more drag. ALso...to get the minor clogging in your razor out, buy a cheap toothbrush give it a few wipes at the end of each shave.... You&#x27;re set. Wish it was available in more stores tho.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ve probably already spent more time reading reviews for this product than is worth your time. Just buy it. It definitely makes for a nicer, easier shave. I tried shaving with JUST this oil, and also used the oil as a base under my shave cream, and both shaves were good (though I prefer to use it as a base). It smells nice, it gives a good amount of lubrication and the price is right. Is it the best shave ever? Debatable. But it is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> If you shave, you must buy this product! I take shaving very seriously. I have used all the best shave creams along with my trusty $200 Feather DE razor and have tried all kinds of shaving products but this little bottle of oil is my most prized shaving product.  I enjoy shaving and most mornings I take the time to do it right. The method I prefer is using hot water on my face the ad 3-4 drops of oil as a base coat but I take it a step further. I add 1 to 2 drops to my Proraso shave soap and use my badger hair brush to make a great lather. Crazy as it sounds the drop of oil makes the soap lather better.  However, on a morning when I am in a hurry I use this oil as per the directions by itself as intended. 3 drops on my face after a hot water splash. I use my Feather double edge razor with great results. I cannot believe a few drops of oil will keep a real razor from killing my face and offer a very professional close shave.  The oil tends to stay on my face and can be a good thing in winter but I prefer to use an alcohol base after shave to cut the oil a bit. My favorite after shave is Osage Rub for this task. The mileage I get from this little bottle is unreal as I bet it last 6 to 9 months or more with me using it everyday. I also use this oil to oil my electric hair clippers as I never think about purchasing oil for that and this bottle is always handy. I like the clean smell as well. I have an entire bathroom sink area full of shaving products as I truly enjoy the art of a good shave but if I was down to only 2 products to buy for shaving would be this oil and a good razor. Highly Recommended and a must have for a good shave!  UPDATE: My local big box store has stopped stocking Shave Secret so I ran out!  Glad I have Amazon Prime! I have been doing without about one month now. My face misses this product BIG TIME!!! However, I have found one added benefit when using this product.  I shave in the shower and keep my razor in the shower. I noticed I now have slightrust form on my blade. When using a few drops of this oil on my face or mixed with my shave soap it keeps the razor from rusting! Major benefit and I find it is almost impossible to get a great shave without this oil! Best shave product made!</li>
            <li> This stuff really works! I&#x27;m a gal, and I love using it for my legs. You don&#x27;t need but a few drops. A few more if necessary. Nakes my skin feel really good. Moisturized and soft...May be for guys, but girls, you&#x27;ll like it too</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first...but this stuff is amazing.  I use a Merkur DE with feather blades and this stuff makes it almost a pleasure to shave.  Im convinced the blades are lasting longer as well since they are always coated with the oil and dont have a chance to oxidize.  Buy this.</li>
            <li> I have a goat tee which I messed up all of the time , cause I couldn&#x27;t define its lines under the regular shaving cream. This product allows me to change the style easily as often as I want . I must use at least 6-7 drops of it , not the 4 as the manufacturer says . Maybe, because I have a lot of facial hair . So , it wont last as long as I expect , but I will keep on buying it . Great product !</li>
            <li> It works but not as well as regular shaving gel/cream. Also, the ingredients are mildly irritating, I would not repurchase. Still looking for a good all-natural shaving gel.</li>
            <li> It does help shaving but it is bad for your skin. Way too many pimples after using the shaving oil!</li>
            <li> I use this when I don&#x27;t have the time to clean and exfoliate my head and face. It helps a lot. Plus the smell of it is good too.</li>
            <li> Comes in a tiny bottle, but you&#x27;re not supposed to use much product.  I use this stuff when shaving my chest. It cuts down on razor burn and ingrown hairs.  Very easy to apply and gives a fantastic result, leaving skin soft.  Especially if you are shaving your chest, use a fresh blade and Shave Secret and I promise you will be happy.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1 Bottle Lasts a LONG TIME&lt;br /&gt;No recycling&lt;br /&gt;Minimal trash&lt;br /&gt;Close and Comfortable Shave&lt;br /&gt;Affordable&lt;br /&gt;Chemical Free&lt;br /&gt;Made in USA&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;None&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best used: Wash face with soap and water, do not skip this step. Without drying face, apply as directed and let the product sit for 10-30 seconds. Shave. Done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another great shaving product for men is Kiss My Face, but my wife always steals it.</li>
            <li> im a hairy man need some tuff shaving stuff and this is not it. im still searching for the shaving gel/oil they make for nasa that i bought a long time ago and cant remember the name...</li>
            <li> First off, I am in the U.S. NAVY and space aboard a ship is limited. I purchased this product from another retailer and instantly realized its ability to perform. The first time I used this product I winced at the thought of shaving without foam, but soon realized that it stands true to its promises. I shave both with multi-blades and when i can a good old DE, and it works well with both styles of shaving. If you are on the fence then all you have left is to give it a try. If you doubt the product then you are sadly going to miss out on a product that performs better than any foam coming from a can.</li>
            <li> I shave everyday using a Braun Series 7 (top model) electric razor - this unit for the past 2 yrs; previously used another Braun model.  I also use a Gillette fusion about once or twice per week to \\&quot;clean up\\&quot; the hair missed by my Braun.  Prior to using Shave Secret, I used William&#x27;s Lectric Shave; have also used the powered shaving block also for a pre-shave for electric razors.  I noticed the difference immediately after using Shave Secret; just added a few drops and rubbed it into my skin well.  I noticed less drag, less irritation or scratching (which occurs from uneven or bumpy skin) and slightly a closer shave.  It may sound like this is negligible but when you shave everyday and can use a \\&quot;stick razor\\&quot; less (although it gives you the closest shave) it makes a difference.  I recommend Shave Secret 200%.</li>
            <li> First off, I really like this product.  I had been using Gillette products since I have been shaving.  I frequently nick myself and end up with razor burn.  So I thought I would try something new.  I am certainly glad I did.  This product is replacing Edge Shaving Gel.  I am using this along with a Gillette Fusion Razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Produces an excellent shave.  It feels good on your skin and has a pleasant odor.&lt;br /&gt;-I have used this product 4 times and have yet to get a nick or any razor burn.  This is highly unusual for me.  This is a major plus and why I will continue using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-I have always frequently rinsed my razor.  However, it still clogs and gums up my razor, even after rinsing after every swipe.&lt;br /&gt;-Occasionally it is difficult to tell where you have shaved and where you still need to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;I think I am going to start using different razors with this product.  I usually keep a Fusion Razor for more than a month.  I don&#x27;t think I can do that using this product.  If anyone has tips for keeping your razor clean using this product please let me know.</li>
            <li> I bought shave secret at wal mart. The claims on the package were so great I had to try it. I feel like I was completely ripped off. I knew the claims were to good to be true. It does not replace shave cream. It does not stop shave irritations. I honestly don&#x27;t know how they are aloud to make these claims.</li>
            <li> I hate to shave; I prefer to have shaved. I have a fairly heavy beard and while I have a beard and have less real estate to groom, it is  nevertheless one of my least favorite rituals. I stumbled upon this product online and happened to see some in a local discount store and decided to try it. To my amazement, it is everything that I hoped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a Fusion razor, so I do benefit from multiple blades and the lubricating strip (which I suspect is of limited value). I use a few drops of SSSO in each area and shave away. My razor glides more easily than it does with regular shaving cream, and I get a shave that is at least as close if not closer than I got with my traditional approach. A quick rinse and I smell great and my skin is much better moisturized by the oil. (I suspect that regular shaving cream dries out my skin. It certainly doesn&#x27;t feel this good after a shave.) The small bottle will also travel better than even the travel-sized aerosol shave cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, put me down as a skeptic-to-SSSO fan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: After a few weeks of using SSSO, a couple more observations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, SSSO contributes to slight clogging of my razor with whiskers that stick to the blades. A vigorous risk under the faucet does the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, I was used to knowing where I&#x27;d shaved by the absence of the shaving cream I had removed. With SSSO, you have no such clue. I have to look and feel carefully to see where I&#x27;ve shaved. No big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I&#x27;m convinced I get a better shave with less irritation, and it takes less time.</li>
            <li> Smell: just okay; not delightful, not awful&lt;br /&gt;Feel: barely perceptible.  I mean, we&#x27;re talking an average of three drops for your whole face! :)&lt;br /&gt;Shave:  pretty close!  But some effort is required; this doesn&#x27;t seem to prop up your whiskers all that well.&lt;br /&gt;Safety:  cuts are minimal and infrequent&lt;br /&gt;Value:  since you really DO just use 3-4 drops, this thing&#x27;ll last a long time and is easy to carry with you on trips&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE:  Try shaving with just 3 drops, and only add more the next time if feel it&#x27;s needed.  I initially tried 5 or 6 drops, and ended up with paradoxically a rather uncomfortable shave (razor just glided over the face without shaving much of anything, so I had to work harder to shave).</li>
            <li> For years I looked for a nonalcohol natural mousturizing after shave. This is an all in one,makes shaving easy and helps with irritation. Aside from that i got very sensitive skin not only in my beard area. I use shave secret all over my face and it works better than any expensive antiaging crema Ive used.Dont be afraid to use it but be careful with your eyes since it has menthol it cna burn a bit at first.The price cant be beaten for such a quality product.I got ingrown hairs,razor bumps cause my skin is very light sensitive and my hair is thick and curly.This doesnt completly solve the problem but together with nice exfoliaiton and straight razor I can control the problem for a close clean shave.5 stars no doubnt about it</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. I can&#x27;t shave without it!</li>
            <li> If I go over 24 hrs. The whiskers do not clean out of the razor very good. Not many Knicks when shaving with this. Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really tell if it helps or not? Doesn&#x27;t hurt that&#x27;s for sure, but....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve discovered though, that it does work well to keep the blade oiled between uses, and I&#x27;ve used it for a few other random items that needed oiling. Kind of a nice, multi-purpose oil to keep around.  If everything locks up in another six months I&#x27;ll update my review, but so far so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still not sure if it makes a bit of difference to a shave though.</li>
            <li> This product works well if you put it on under shaving cream.  I use Barbasol which works fine.&lt;br /&gt;To shave I use a Merkur safety Razor with feather blades. By running water over the blade often, I never experienced it becoming clogged/gunked up.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like the clove smell, which reminds me of food.  I cooked the Turkey this Thanksgiving in which clove was an ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When this runs out, I&#x27;ll try a similar product like American Crew, that (hopefully) has a better smell.  Bottom line, this will improve your shaving results and make it easier, no doubt.&lt;br /&gt;If it had a better smell, it would be 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;By the way I bought secret shave at Walmart.</li>
            <li> The menthol makes for a nice tingly sensation. The oil does a good job as advertised. It&#x27;s not quite as smooth as shaving creme, but good enough to travel with. It can clog up the blades of the razor if you don&#x27;t have strong water pressure. I sometimes use an old toothbrush to declog.</li>
            <li> Has made my top ten list. It makes the areas I shave so much smoother and keeps me from getting razor burns and bumps. The only thing that you may find irritating is that you so have to swish the razor in water more often while using this, fantastic for my legs but not so much for my razor. Oh and after your done shaving your legs you don&#x27;t even have to moisturize, it makes your skin look and feel soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Had my first shave with this stuff. 3 to 5 drops did not even come close. It was like shaving with just water. Put some more on and massaged it in real good. A little bit better. Put some Foamy over top and it worked fairly well that way. I did get a closer shave than with just Foamy only. It did leave my face feeling great. Just don&#x27;t think it is all it is supposed to be.</li>
            <li> I have been buying some fairly expensive shaving products for about 3 years now.  A good multi blade razor with vibration and some Jack Black or Art of shaving shave cream.&lt;br /&gt;I get a better shave with this oil alone.  I was amazed when I first shaved with two days growth.  Wet your face apply oil shave.  Shave with the grain, apply more water and shave against the grain.  No discomfort, no cuts and a pleasant eucalyptus after glow. Like magic.</li>
            <li> I buy this from Walmart. If I use regular shaving cream or lotion, regardless if it is for senstive skin, I will breakk out and the itching is PAINFUL.  I have NO problems with this stuff and have sworn my it for the last 2 years!  I have very dry skin because of thryoid issues that are just getting corrected.  It has saved me from a lot of pain.</li>
            <li> Way better than shaving cream. Now I make my own oil that is much cheaper with castor oil. coconut oil, and essential oils.</li>
            <li> I work as a doorman, so every day I have to shave so I did not want to be shaving with a razor every day so I bought myself a shaving machine and then started using this product, before used this product when my beard was growing it used to itch so I was always scratching my face, after using this product the scratching is gone and I have been great ever since. The best way to use is wet your face slightly then use at least 4 drops and rub it in your face, and whala!!!!! Great product love it</li>
            <li> When I started straight razor shaving I tried every shave cream/soap/gel I could get my hands on to see what worked best (for me of course).  My final preferences are the soft soaps that come in pots like Proraso and Omega and best of all The Real Shaving Co&#x27;s Shave Cream in a tube.  These all develop a richer lather with better lubrication than any of the hard shaving soap bars, even glycerine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still try anything I haven&#x27;t tried before which leads me to this product.  What I found is that this simply adds a lubrication layer where it may be needed and does nothing where it is not.  I used two methods, one as directed coating the skin with a thin layer before applying the lather and the other where you put a few drops in your lather bowl and whip it in with your chosen soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results: with the hard soap bars it does help lubricate the skin better and give a more comfortable shave.  With the better soaps listed above it made no difference at all.  In the end if you add it to soap bars you improve performance and increase cost (about $15/once).  If you use the better soaps to begin with you have similar cost and a simpler experience with similar results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, I will just keep using the better shaving soaps and use this for it&#x27;s wonder essential oil blend fragrance.</li>
            <li> not a &#x27;miracle&#x27; product but helps for sure....keeps the skin smooth and the blade glides over it taking the wiskers with it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. I get a comfortable shave every time, it takes up no space in my medicine cabinet, and it smells good. It does gunk up the razor a bit, but it washes out easy enough. I&#x27;ll use it for now on.</li>
            <li> It works exactly as described! Before I started using this product, my face would feel raw after shaving. Now, when I use the product before shaving, my face feels smooth, and nice after shaving.</li>
            <li> I started with one bottle of Shave Secret and liked it so much I bought the 8 pack about a year ago from the website.  Last week I ran out again and thought I would try to use up some of my old shaving cream and shaving gels before I reordered again from Shavesecret.  That experiment lasted less than a week, because it felt like I was scraping my faces with a sharp rock.  I just ordered the 12 pack.  This is the best way to shave that I have found, and it&#x27;s great for travel too, because I can keep a bottle in my travel baggie and not think about it when I&#x27;m packing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may look crazy to replace a big can of shaving cream with a tiny bottle of oil, but it really works.  I just wish Amazon would make the 12 pack available via Amazon Prime.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best I&#x27;ve used for shaving (I use a safety razor).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One downside is the price here on Amazon. The same size bottle is available for $4 at most Wal-Mart&#x27;s. Huge rip off to buy online.</li>
            <li> This oil has become a part of my daily shaving routine.  I love it.  I have a coarse beard and sensitive skin.  Not a grand combination.  Using oil to soften my beard before shaving does wonders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, if you don&#x27;t mind venturing into Walmart, it&#x27;s a third the price, there…around two dollars and fifty cents.</li>
            <li> Using this oil will clog up a modern 3-5 blade razor within 4 strokes. But if you use a &amp;#34;safety razor&amp;#34;, a razor with only one blade then you can get a very nice smooth shave with this oil. Definitely better than soap and more moisturizing than foams or gels.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first that I would not be able to use this as a shaving agent by itself for my corse face hair but it definitely works! Just have to rinse the razor well after each stroke. I still use shaving cream with it just as a personal preference thought.&lt;br /&gt;Smells good and is a nice oil :)</li>
            <li> I bought this stuff at Walmart.  At first I was kind of skeptical but after using it for roughly 3 months I can say it&#x27;s the best shaving oil I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> The overly-positive reviews are true, this oil is magical and amazingly cheap.</li>
            <li> Basically all this is is some oil mixed in with Menthol (the main cooling agent in this product) and essentially it does not do anything but create a tingling, almost numb &#x27;cooling&#x27; sensation on your beard area when you shave, and this weird tingling remains after you wash it off too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had to use about 15 drops and still did not feel it spreading. Followed instructions thoroughly. And my facial hair had only had half a day to grow!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only should everyone question this product and how over priced it is, but they should question all the so called positive reviews! Fake accounts? I think if a few people trying to start a scam business were greedy enough they could possibly get 500+ people to leave positive reviews on just about any web site, for a cut of the profit! Use Coconut oil instead, under normal shaving cream!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And by the way, I am in no way, shape or form affiliated with any company. Otherwise I would have said XX product worked better than this!</li>
            <li> works well, but I have a skin allergy to this product</li>
            <li> Product as described; fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t a believer, but thought what the heck - try it! It actually gives me the closest shave an electric razor has given - by far! Use it with my Panasonic, and it does great!</li>
            <li> If you shave only twice a week like me and keep a thicker beard this is not the product for you. It allows the longer hairs to clog the razor easily and they are tough to rinse out. If you shave every day this bottle would be awesome!</li>
            <li> I bought this based on all the good reviews. But I found it completely useless. It literally feels like your shaving with just water and MAYBE a touch of oil. Needless to say my face was not happy afterwards.</li>
            <li> I have had issues with ingrown/split/impacted hairs from shaving for as long as I can remember.  I started using this and the one impacted hair I&#x27;ve had since then was on the sideburn part of my face, which is easy to pluck with tweezers, and none on the part of the face where the cheek/jawbone go from vertical to horizontal towards the neck which was always the big problem area.  It&#x27;s smells cinnamon, strongly, but I&#x27;m willing to cope with that until they come out with a blend of oils that smells better.</li>
            <li> Would prefer scentless and not sure how much better it is than other shave oils, but it definitely gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Best shave ever.  I&#x27;ve used gel, cream, soap, everything else I could find.  I got a free trial of this and tried it out and couldn&#x27;t believe how easy the shave was.&lt;br /&gt;2-3 drops is plenty, so this tiny bottle will last a long time.  And it feels like the razor just slides over my skin, as if I weren&#x27;t even shaving.&lt;br /&gt;But when it&#x27;s done, its an extremely close shave.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this.  I don&#x27;t know what some people are doing wrong, but this works really great for me.</li>
            <li> This shave oil is it&#x27;s best when used as a pre-shave oil.  I lather up some Proraso with filtered water and out it on top of this for a very smooth shave.  It leaves the skin feeling soft and healthy.  If you use it on your head, wet it first, then use 9-10 drops; any less ruins it&#x27;s effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to Anthony Logistics and the Art of Shaving Unscented Pre-shave oil, Shave secret wins buy a mile.  The thickness of Anthony Logistics and Art of Shaving causes me to break out, whereas as Shave Secret is a perfect consistency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works great with a headblade, Panasonic Linear ES8103 (great for head shaving), and a Merkur safety razor.  Nothing is perfect obviously, but this a step in the right direction.  Worth the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for a few days now and don&#x27;t get any shaving irritation using my DE razor. I like that you don&#x27;t have to add more product to your face, just have to re-wet it. Will definitely order more.</li>
            <li> Delivered on time. Meets the claims. ordering more.</li>
            <li> ...I&#x27;ve been wet shaving (DE/Safety) for about four weeks now (about 8 times) and had been using a shaving soap. I tried Shave Secret for the first time last week. I love the smell and it is strong. You do need more than three drops. It clogs my razor (E. Jagger) badly and is hard to clean under running water or shaking in still water. It was my first shave with NO nicks or cuts!! I was amazed over that. All in all, I like this a lot. I won&#x27;t use it every time but I will use it periodically. Got it at Walmart for $3.78.</li>
            <li> I will not buy this again! Leaves my face and my silvertip with a layer of grease. Hard to wash off, feels like old oil from a frying pan.</li>
            <li> I am glad some found it useful but I didn&#x27;t at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a disposable razor and Edge Gel and have for years. I am always looking for a deal and anything that makes life simple. As for Pros: the bottle is small, it is plastic and it&#x27;s small...wait I said that..okay...the cap comes off easy?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the Cons: it didn&#x27;t work in any way shape or form. I tried multiple drops up to 10 and I added water to try and thin it out. Nothing worked. It doesn&#x27;t feel at all slippery on your face and when you&#x27;re done you will need to wash your face well with soap to get the coating and blood off. It just is a total disappointment. I threw the bottle out after a few days. If I could give this product zero stars I would&#x27;ve but 1 is the bottom limit. Just as well for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to make some money, slap some mineral oil in a tiny bottle with some fragrance, cal it a revolution in shaving and sell it. It won&#x27;t cost you much for product so it will be easy money. That is the best shave Secret! A can of Edge lasts me about six months so it is still my best shave. I haven&#x27;t tried a straight razor but it intrigues me. I suspect it would be a mess until I got used to it. One thing for sure, if I do try a new razor, it will be with conventional shave products not this funky oil in a tiny bottle.</li>
            <li> Well, 2.5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;I use a double-edge also and it worked but I had some cuts and nics near my upper lip. Fragrance is nice and the menthol didn&#x27;t work for me. I still felt like I needed to wash my face and did before towel drying. I even used extra drops and oil and I had some drag too. Seems a little expensive considering how long I can get a soap puck to last; so then I think it will be more expensive. I usually shave in shower and it was a nice change to not having to shower to get a shave. Might work for those on the safety-razor wagon... Seems very suitable as a pre-shave oil for electric, but I could see clogging becoming an issue.</li>
            <li> Meh. Overpriced IMO, and I can&#x27;t tell the difference with or without it. This is NOT a standalone shave cream substitute as they suggest. Get real.</li>
            <li> I use this with a Panasonic Arc3 class shaver (LT71), and it has really improved my shaving experience. The Panasonic would pinch once in a while prior to my using this, but now it&#x27;s just smooth. It&#x27;s a lot better than using foam with an electric shaver (yes, I tried that route and it just didn&#x27;t work well for me). Smells nice, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that you can get this a lot cheaper at Walmart, but as a product this one is really nice.</li>
            <li> After turning 57 I finally enjoyed shaving.&lt;br /&gt;I like a close, smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt shave. I have always suffered through ingrowns and shaving burns until Shave Secret combined with the Edwin Jagger DE89Lbl razor and Astra Superior Premium blades.&lt;br /&gt;The bumps and razor burns have been drastically reduced.&lt;br /&gt;I use two drops on each wet cheek and each side of my throat after getting out of the shower. Sometimes after my shave I message in a couple of drops on my throat which actually seems to soften the whiskers.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t was off after shaving. Just dry your face. Your face will feel so much better not having been dried out my soap.&lt;br /&gt;Guys enjoy shaving for once in your life.</li>
            <li> Item arrived on time and as described. So far so good.</li>
            <li> Decided to try this after being unable to purchase more Anthony Sport pre-shave oil. Bottle I smaller than other pre-shave oils I have used, but I find I need less of this to get the same coverage. Has a somewhat strong scent that I like, but might not be to others liking.</li>
            <li> This is 1000x better than any shaving cream. Nothing more to say other than, BUY IT!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really not a huge secret.  If you&#x27;ve ever tried shaving with coconut oil (yes, I have) you&#x27;ll recognize this.  I&#x27;m not saying that&#x27;s what this is, but that&#x27;s how it feels.  I used it to shave my head and it did clog up the razor somewhat (the 5-blade Fusion) and the hair sticks to the sink.  I only shaved with coconut oil once and I only used this stuff once too.  Neither one really worked that well.  However, all that being said, I think this would probably be ok for shaving your face since the skin is a little tougher.  But I won&#x27;t be using it for my head again.</li>
            <li> I use a safety razor and have had occasional periods of nicks and chafed skin. I saw this and figured, the most I had to lose was $3. WOW-3-5 drops and I was set. Followed the directions and had one of the closest shaves since I started using a safety razor. No irritation afterwards. Will be switching from $24 oil to this product!</li>
            <li> It seems to work ok but it does DEFINITELY have a distinct odor. I had to vigorously wash it off and had to do so repeatedly to get the smell to go away. It reminds me of dime-store old man cheap cologne. Its gross. It may work ok but that smell is awful. I am not sure where the other find the smell is &amp;#34;mild&amp;#34; or ok or that it goes away. I found that it did not. Its true it does not smell like vicks, but it does have a bad cheap cologne fragrance that lingers.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions for half my head &amp; used shaving cream on the other side and a new blade. I couldn&#x27;t really tell any difference between the two. I&#x27;ll try again and if there is any difference will do another review.</li>
            <li> I was surprised, but this actually works really well. It takes the place of shaving cream, so you don&#x27;t have to buy that.</li>
            <li> My husband says this stuff is amazing and he can&#x27;t even understand how it works, but it works so well! He shaves his head every 2-3 days and used to get a lot of irritation on his scalp. Since using this, he says it is easier to shave plus it looks less irritated after!</li>
            <li> It does work.  Shaving is easier with the lubrication, and it does work with the water on the face to spread remarkably well with just a few drops.  I use a few drops for each side of the face.  On the other hand, I get satisfactory results with just water, although the oil is better for a really close shave.  Me having an oily skin may have something to do with that.  And it does last a long time, making the price a bit easier.</li>
            <li> Best shave i ever had withan electric razor.</li>
            <li> Great item at a great price would buy again</li>
            <li> I have ultra sensitive skin and shaving makes my face &amp; neck feel irritated and dry.  I&#x27;m always looking for a better shaving cream, gel, razor and other miracle product.  My wife bought this stuff at Walmart and I tried it for the first time last night, with some skepticism.  I was pleasantly surprised that it works fairly well.  The razor glides over my skin better than with shaving cream and I seemed to have less razor burn.  So far I&#x27;m impressed and I think this might be my new shaving solution.</li>
            <li> By far, after only using it only once, I encountered the best shave I ever had. No nicks, no irritation, no difficulties and you finish your shave with a pleasant scent. Wet your face, place a few drops in your palm, work the oil into you skin, then shave. It&#x27;s as easy as that. I wish I found this product decades ago.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a foam.  It&#x27;s not a soap.  And it&#x27;s not a gel.  It&#x27;s an oil that you put on your face prior to shaving.  It works with an electric razor as well it works with a blade.  Is it magic?  No, but it is very, very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who would have thought that a few drops of oil applied to wet skin can make such a difference in shaving comfort and effectiveness!  I have been shaving for over 30 years and have just now come across this product.  And it happened by accident.  I shave with an electric razor.  A Panasonic model that came with its own cleaning system.  I have been very happy with that razor.  I also use Remington&#x27;s Shaver Saver lubricant on the shaver&#x27;s foil and cutters prior to each shave.  When I ran out of the spray, I went to the local shopping center to get a new can.  The store did not have them in stock.  So, I started looking for an alternative and came across this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product works much better than most shaving foams.  It works just as well as the Gillette shaving gels.  What the oil does is allow the razor, whether it be foil or blade, to glide smoothly on the skin.  Since the hairs are lubricated, the foil can simply glide over without pulling.  This is important because you do not always get all of the hair in one pass.  Typically, the ones that evade the blade gets pulled as the razor moves past, causing skin irritation and possible breakouts.  You can then go back over the same area to get the remaining hairs.  The oil allows you to do this, to do multiple passes over the same area, without razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use this product sparingly.  You only need a few drops.  Wet your face with water, place a few drops of oil on your palm, and massage gently.  You are now ready to shave.  I think you will be surprised how much difference three drops of oil can make.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell of the oil is pleasant, but it is not something that most men would like to wear to work.  It has a smell reminiscent of cedar and menthol.  Pleasant, but it is definitely not a scent that anyone would mistake for a cologne.  You can wash the scent away.  Perhaps the best routine is to shave prior to taking your morning shower.  That way, the oil gets washed away.  The oil is supposedly good for your skin.  Maybe you will want to try the no-rinse approach on weekends and see if your skin benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is this the best-kept secret in shaving products for men?  How did it manage to remain under the radar of most men?  I suspect it&#x27;s because of the heavy marketing supporting the various foams and gels from the big name brands.  Give this product a try.

            <li> I heard some endorsements for this product on the radio and ordered it from Amazon. My husband has very sensitive skin and has tried many products for a good shave. He says this is the best product he has ever tried. I have heard him recommend the product to friends and family.</li>
            <li> Makes electric shaving easier and has a great scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually not sure if I even used it right. I applied the shaving oil and then applied my shaving cream afterwards. Seemed to have to go over it again more after using the shave oil as opposed to not using it at all. Will keep trying.</li>
            <li> great for preventing bumps</li>
            <li> I bought this after forgetting my shaving gear prior to going to the gym. There is a Wal-Mart across the street from where I work, so I figured I&#x27;d pick up some gel and a disposable razor and shave in the men&#x27;s room. I happened to find this oil along with a Micro Touch One safety razor, and have heard rave reviews about both, so decided to try for myself. The shave was amazing! No razor burn, no irritation, and all with a brand new shaving setup. The smell was decent enough, not what I&#x27;d use for a cologne, but not overpowering, either.</li>
            <li> Works pretty darn good.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but this was recommended by a trusted friend.  I can&#x27;t be happier. Works well and takes up no shave in my travel kit.  Order a second one because it will replace your main shave cream/gel!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! My son used to get awful bumps when he shaved and now it doesn&#x27;t happen with just a couple drops of this wonderful oil.</li>
            <li> I found that shaving with Shave Secret alone was a little rough, so I added a shaving soap and that did the trick.  So Shave Secret along with a shaving soap still saves money.  I&#x27;ll by it again.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant at first but wow what a great product! No more razor burns or dry skin. Just amazing!</li>
            <li> I love shave secret oil. It&#x27;s cleaner than any other shaving material, and it does not leave rashes on my face like other products. It&#x27;s keeps skin most.</li>
            <li> Ok, I had read the reviews, so I felt I had to try the product.  Quite frankly I don&#x27;t understand the positive reviews.  I have tried to use the product multiple times, and it just seems barely adequate at best.&lt;br /&gt;The instructions say:&lt;br /&gt;1) Generously wet the area to be shaved&lt;br /&gt;  - This was easy enough to do.&lt;br /&gt;2) In a moist palm, massage 3-5 drops of Shave Secret&lt;br /&gt;  -  This is very easy to do.&lt;br /&gt;3) Massage into the area to be shaved and wait 5 - 10 seconds&lt;br /&gt;  - This sounds ridiculously easy to do, BUT in practice it&#x27;s NOT!  The product is clear, so as you apply it to your face, you can&#x27;t see it, nor can you feel it on your face.  You try to spread it evenly on your areas to shave, but in practice it&#x27;s pretty hard to tell if you have everything covered.&lt;br /&gt;4) Shave as usual. (Be sure to rinse your razor often)&lt;br /&gt;  - So you try to shave as normal, and in my experience some areas it works OK (just ok), and in others not so well.  So I suspect I didn&#x27;t get the product evenly distributed, which accounts for the difference in it working better in some areas than others.  Now I tried this on many occasions with the same success, and I have to say I really, really tried to give this product the benefit of the doubt.  I really, really wanted this to work...but I think it&#x27;s a waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;5) No need to rinse the shaved area, just towel dry.&lt;br /&gt;  - I agree on this part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So...I have to say, I only have one face, and I suspect there are differences to peoples faces and the texture of their whiskers/beard hair.  But I really don&#x27;t understand the overall positive reviews of the product.  Can I be the only one thinking what I think?</li>
            <li> It might as well not be there. Actually feels as if I am dragging a razor over a dry face. Water doesn&#x27;t make it glide, just freakin rips the hairs out, and hurts like hell. Good luck getting a great shave, takes 3 times longer than normal, and I feel like I hardly shaved at all. Would like to use something natural to shave, but this is just not working.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first, I&#x27;ve been trying to get away from canned foaming shaving products for a while. I have found this shaving oil to be everything the manufacturer claims it to be. First a little background, I shave in the shower by feel every other day with a Gillette disposable razor. Since I have more growth than a daily shaver I use 5-6 drops per use. I wet my face first with warm water, apply the oil and shave normally. I&#x27;ve been using it for well over six months and wouldn&#x27;t switch back for anything. The smell is pleasant, with the dominant smell of cloves. There is a hint of a metallic odor, but it is minor and not overwhelming. In the time I&#x27;ve been using the oil I haven&#x27;t had one instance of a nick or razor burn. In fact the annoying random pimples have stopped also. I highly recommend trying this product.</li>
            <li> Shave Secret works very well as a pre-shave oil. There are others out there I&#x27;d recommend over this one in particular, but it still holds its own. I&#x27;ve found I could even shave with this oil alone along with my safety razor with little or no discomfort.</li>
            <li> Thought it BS. Is not. Works good. I was very surprised but also very happy with the purchase. Do it.</li>
            <li> This stuff works! I was skeptical like a lot of other first time users but now I&#x27;m a believer. Just wet your face, put about 5 drops in your wet palm and message it into your face. It won&#x27;t feel like much at first but once you start shaving you&#x27;ll notice the difference immediately. Spend the 4 bucks and give it a shot, you won&#x27;t be dissapointed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good and I&#x27;ll probably continue to use it, but it&#x27;s not the greatest discovery ever, as represented by the radio commercials.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s nice, works well and it smells decent.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing little product. If you have delicate skin in your chin and cheeks, go for it it will help you a lot, I&#x27;ve tried many products and this works perfectly ,dont shave daily, alternate one yes one no, it will work for you.&lt;br /&gt;This is also great for travel, this little bottle will last like 2 months or more!</li>
            <li> In place of the shaving soap from Art of Shaving, this didn&#x27;t do the job for my husband.</li>
            <li> There are much better products out there. Not many for this price, but my rule of thumb is that if you are looking for a quality shave, avoid anything sold at walmart.</li>
            <li> I first must mention that I follow the manufacturer&#x27;s instructions, but use it as a pre-shave oil, not a shaving oil. After a minute of working it into my skin, I apply a heated cloth to my face and neck. Then I apply Taylor of Old Bond Street Lavender shave cream or L&#x27;Occitane shave soap with a badger brush working it into a lather on my face. Now when I shave, I get no, and I mean no, irritation. Good face prep, especially hydrating your skin and beard,is the key, as is a sharp blade, but Shave Secret is the critical next step.  With this routine, I never get razor burn.  Ever.  I love this stuff.  Shaving is enjoyable for the first time in my life.  As a side note, I use a double edge safety razor, but Shave Secret will help any man that wet shaves, regardless of brand or style of razor.  Enjoy your shave.</li>
            <li> It does not work on my beard.</li>
            <li> Once again I changed my mind. This product does work well. I am just getting used to using a safety razor. You have to make sure you do NOT use any pressure. Kind of akward at first. However, I tried again today and I received the closest smoothest shave ever! My skin feels soft and refreshed. Not irritated and stinging! Make sure you use a lot of water. I only used 6 drops for the entire three pass shave. On my third shave I decided not even use shaving cream.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use as a base layer for shaving and so far so good. I usually apply between 5-6 drops and rub it all over my shaving area of my face, then apply shave cream as normal. It seems to work well as the first coating and to my knolwedge has provided a good clean shave. Id recommend it  and consider getting it again in the future.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had problems with shaving because I have such sensitive skin, and using an electric razor (Panasonic ES8103S Pro-Curve Wet/Dry Rechargeable Linear Pivot Action Shaving System, Silver). BUT, the electric razor, although kinder on my skin, would sometimes drag, making for a frustrating shave experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Problem solved: By using two drops of Shave Secret before I shave, my electric razor glides smoothly over my face every time.</li>
            <li> I have used an electric razor and dry shaved for decades.  Saw this and decided to try it.  I have trouble spots along my jawline and where the side of my neck meets the chin and by reading the reviews, thought it might help.  Followed all the instructions and it made the non trouble spots baby smooth.  The trouble spots it helped some, but not as I hoped.  The deal breaker for me is the odor of this oil.  I shower after I shave and all day long can still smell this oil from my skin.  I returned to dry shaving after a week.</li>
            <li> Uhh...the product is tiny. I must not understand my measurements, b/c this product came in a bottle about the size of eye drops. The oil itself is ok, nothing spectacular. The secret is, the bottle is tiny.</li>
            <li> Used alone it&#x27;s not good at all.  But use it under a quality shave cream/lotion etc and it makes the shave 10X better than the cream alone.</li>
            <li> Very small and handy!!! Gives you a good shave</li>
            <li> I used to shave every other day because I didn&#x27;t like the hassle of shaving. This makes shaving fast and easy. It does not give me as close of a shave compared to the Kiehl&#x27;s product I have used for 5+ years but this is good enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not get razor burns or cuts from this. It does seem to have a bit of a Bay Rum smell to it.</li>
            <li> I detest shaving, and what it has become.  The idea that you have to buy the latest 17 blade contraption is ridiculous to me.  So, about a year ago, I switched to a safety razor.  I absolutely love being able to buy a box of razors that would last me a year for what you could spend easily on a month supply of &amp;#34;modern&amp;#34; razors.  My only problem was that no matter how hard I tried, I would nick myself quite a bit.  That is until I tried Shave Secret.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought I had found a great shaving cream that was all natural, smelled wonderful, and was very good for my skin.  Then I kept hearing ads on a talk show radio program that inspired me to buy Shave Secret.  I am now 100% sold on this product.  It has reduced my nicks from the safety razor down to a very bare minimum.  You really do only need a few drops!  When an area gets a little dry, you simply slap some water on it, and keep going.  You don&#x27;t need anymore than a few (I use 4) drops to get the cleanest, closest shave you can possibly get!  The scent is also subtle, and it gives you an invigorating sensation on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it would be very difficult to talk me into switching now.  It is a very compact size, so it&#x27;s easy to travel with, it does a far better job than any other product I have tried, and the best part is that you can actually see where you&#x27;re shaving so you don&#x27;t miss any spots!  Also, considering I was paying $18 per bottle for my previous shaving cream, this is an absolute steal!  Ditch your million blade, vibrating, colorful plastic razor, buy a nice metal safety razor, and give Shave Secret a try!  You absolutely won&#x27;t regret the savings or the closeness of the shave with this product.  They even guarantee it!</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve always used shaving gels, creams, whatever, and they don&#x27;t work very well because I still end up with cuts and nicks and razor burn. But three drops of this stuff and seriously, extremely QUICK, painless shave everywhere, legs, wherever you wanna shave, though I don&#x27;t know how it would work on the face. Worth the money!</li>
            <li> Yo-    WOW!!!  This &#x27;snake oi&#x27;l is the real deal. I got mine today and immediately shaved my two day old medium heavy hairy face with it and WOW - the stuff really works!!  Five drops and shaved both ways - down then up - five minutes start to finish with my Parker 99R with Gillette Silver Blue blade.    Just bought two more for backup.    Recommend A+++++</li>
            <li> This is very much like a French shaving oil I used years ago, a nice clove smell. You spray your legs with water, wait a bit, then rub some oil on. I use a regular throw-away blade shaver. Then wipe your legs clean with a soft, sturdy paper towel. No shower! Haven&#x27;t tried it on any other part of my body, but don&#x27;t see why it wouldn&#x27;t work. Great for a fast touch-up-and-go. Beards? I simply don&#x27;t know. Inexpensive.</li>
            <li> Razor gets clogged with hair and doesn&#x27;t rinse out.</li>
            <li> Great product!! My husband just loved it and we will be reordering.</li>
            <li> well. It is fine. Not like some other 5 star review. I don&#x27;t feel very smooth. But it is cool after put it on skin. Don&#x27;t really like the smell BTW.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let this little unassuming wonder fool you. Get this and be a happy shaver.&lt;br /&gt;You too will be in on the secret.</li>
            <li> Wow.  Been shaving for a long, long time and this is the first shaving aid I have found that actually does make shaving better.  By better I mean less painful, smoother and ever a little quicker.  I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s in this stuff, and I probably don&#x27;t want to know, but it works very well.  I use it both with my electric and blade shavers and it performs well with both.</li>
            <li> Just didn&#x27;t work for me - back to shaving cream</li>
            <li> As others have stated, amazing product! I rarely write reviews, but this is very worth of a review.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been all over using safety razors cartridges and any kind of cream I could find. I have coarse hair and would always getter nicked with the safety razor. Now I am good to go. My coarse hair that grows every which way is now match for my shave secret and DE safety razor combo. Saving lots of money as I am require to shave daily.</li>
            <li> So I ran a half marathon a few months back, and they had this tiny sample of shave secret in a bag of mostly advertisements/coupons. I have eczema, and I had been purchasing the \\&quot;sensitive skin\\&quot; Gillette foaming stuff to shave with. But it always left my skin feeling really hot and sometimes really itchy. The first time I used this I couldn&#x27;t believe how good it felt because I had never had a shaving experience as good as this one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, I assumed that it was just any essential oil that would do the trick, so I tried this other sample of essential oils that is supposed to help you focus or something to shave, and it wasn&#x27;t nearly as good! I figured this stuff would be crazy pricey, but it is about the same as a container of shaving cream. And this stuff lasts forever, so you do the math!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great for electric razor. Just three drops!</li>
            <li> I use shaving soap and a brush at home, but I like this stuff for travel, because it takes up so little space in my toiletry kit.  It works very well, so long as you keep rinsing your blade out (which you should do anyway).  Very satisfied with the close shave and absence of any skin irritation.</li>
            <li> For the last couple of years I&#x27;ve been fooling around with razors, blades, and shaving creams trying to get a closer, more comfortable shave. At age 82 I&#x27;ve done a heckuva lot of shaving, with both conventional and electric razors. I don&#x27;t have a really dense beard, but being born with curly hair my whiskers are stiff, grow in all directions, and often don&#x27;t stand up like nice guys so I can easily mow them down. Instead they like to lie flat and try to avoid the approaching razor&#x27;s edge. Up till now I&#x27;ve got my closest, most comfortable shaves using a Schick Quattro razor with a four blade (plus edger) titanium refill cartridge. An absolutely identical clone is made under the brand name Wilkinson Sword. I bought one in Italy, where I also discovered Proraso a great shaving soap made in Florence. Used with a nice, soft badger brush I thought that combination was pretty much just peachy. Of course the refill blade cartridges cost a fortune. Then a persistent TV commercial for the MicroTouch One Classic Safety Razor with 24 FREE blades caught my attention by promising &amp;#34;The Best Shave of Your Life!&amp;#34; That sent me off to search Amazon, my recent source for everything. I ended up not with the MicroTouch magic product but with a Japanese twist-to-open Feather Razor and 100 Astra Platinum blades made in St. Petersburg, Russia. I also ended up cutting myself two or three times every time I shaved. I put the whole works in a drawer when Harry came along in an e-mail offering a beautifully designed $15 dollar razor and German-made four-blade refill cartridge that cost wa-a-a-y-y less than Schick, Gillette, or Wilkinson Sword Competitors. The packaging was beautiful, the price was right, the flexible head on the Harry&#x27;s razor comfortably followed the contours of my face and I thought I was finally there. With Harry&#x27;s blade and Proraso soap I was getting a nice shave, even though it didn&#x27;t seem quite as close as I thought it could be. I kept thinking about those sharp, sharp Russian blades and the Feather razor that I was afraid to use for fear of bleeding to death. At that point I heard about Shave Secret Shaving Oil and :I was also at the point of needing to order more Harry&#x27;s blades. The Shave Secret oil cost about six bucks. Having come this far on my shaving journey, I thought, &amp;#34;What the hell is six bucks? Maybe there something I&#x27;m missing here.&amp;#34; There was. I dug out my banished Feather razor, put in a new Astra blade, and have used it with Shave Secret for the last three or four weeks, shaving daily or every other day. I have never had such an effortless shave. It is like there is no blade in the razor to drag through tough whiskers. Except the whiskers mysteriously disappear and I can see them as they are flushed out of the razor when I rinse it under the hot water faucet. I have no razor cuts. As long as I periodically re-wet my face, I can razor over it with, against and across the grain repeatedly with no razor burn or discomfort. I just shaved and as I write this I can rub my cheeks, throat, chin and jaw which now feel about like they did when I was five years old, like the proverbial baby&#x27;s butt. The downside? With gray whiskers, when I apply Shave Secret to my face, I can&#x27;t see it. It doesn&#x27;t make any lather like my lovely Proraso soap did, so I can&#x27;t really see where I&#x27;ve been shaving. I just have to be a little more careful that I don&#x27;t miss any parts of my now amazingly smooth visage. It&#x27;s a small price to pay.arp Russian blades and the Feather razor that I was afraid to use for fear of bleeding to death.

            <li> I bought this because I&#x27;m a girl who has hirsutism (male pattern hair growth on a  woman), so I need a very, very close shave to feel normal and properly feminine. Honestly, I can&#x27;t tell if it really did much (I mean, how much closer can I shave?). Beyond that, I have rather sensitive skin and the menthol feel reminds me of what my skin starts to feel like when something&#x27;s going wrong, but then nothing happens, no rash or redness or anything. But the feeling bothers me, so since it doesn&#x27;t seem to do much for me and bothers me a bit, I&#x27;m voting no on this one. Maybe it&#x27;ll work for you.</li>
            <li> This stuff is pretty incredible. I have oily skin and somewhat curly facial hair, and I often struggle with redness and ingrown hairs. Shave Secret makes shaving easy, and it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin all red or dried out. I was a bit skeptical when this first arrived, but I must say I was blown away by this product. It really works and it smells fantastic!!! I have spent so much money over the years trying to find a natural shaving cream/gel/oil that works as promised, and this is definitely one of the few I&#x27;ve found to be effective (ZIRH Pre-Shave Oil and Shave Gel are the others). I hope this stays a secret!!!</li>
            <li> way better than shaving cream. No more razor burn.</li>
            <li> Seems to lubricate well and make it easier to shave.  Do not get it in your eyss--I made a  mistake and the menthol burns.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, I have been using it for many years.....</li>
            <li> Best shave product ever!!! I never bother to write any reviews about any products but shave secret deserves it</li>
            <li> Only two drops needed.  Add to wet face in shower.  Makes electric razor glide and you get a close shave.  No need to shave in shower if you dint want to.  I use it with an electric razor after getting out of shower.  it works wonders.</li>
            <li> I have made a long journey on my way to using shaving oil (See my review of [[ASIN:B000FX88XS King of Shaves]] for the entire story).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is good shaving oil - The smell is reminisent of Old Spice. Drop control is good. Single drops of oil are dispensed by squeezing the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The follwoing evaluation compares [[ASIN:B004ZBS4U8 Somersets Original English]], [[ASIN:B000FX88XS King of Shaves]], and [[ASIN:B0023XF60Q Shave Secret]] shaving oils. I use the excellent [[ASIN:B003YJB026 Braun Series 5]] for shaving - Your choice of shaver might influence your choice of shaving oil - In my case, I noticed no difference in the effectiveness of the shaver regardless of oil used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that my evaluation is __my__ humble opinion (except for any evaluation marked with an &#x27;*&#x27; - which means use common sense!). I will rank these oils as first, second, and third - Sorry, there are no participation trophies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works best when following directions:*** All three&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most pleasant smell: Somersets, King of Shaves, Shave Secret&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best beard conditioner (most astringent): Shave Secret, Somersets, King of Shaves&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best Buy (as of 2/26/15): King of Shaves (35¢/ml), Shave Secret (37¢/ml), Somersets (66¢/ml)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dispenser Control (per drop): Somersets, Shave Secret, King of Shaves&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though I prefer Somersets, I have all three and will continue to use all three until gone. Stick with what you are using IF you are using a shaving oil - BUT you cannot go wrong with Shave Secret. IF NOT using a shaving oil, I recommend trying all three; cost: less than $24 - You won&#x27;t regret switching to shaving oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RECOMMENDED</li>
            <li> I use shaving oil when traveling since it takes up less room in my luggage &amp; complies with TSA liquid restrictions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shave Secret is a good shaving oil, but I prefer King of Shaves to it.  I&#x27;m not a big fan of the scent of Shave Secret.  I also feel like King of Shaves lubricates my face better and spreads easier which lets me use the recommended 3 drops vs. the 5 or 6 I use with Shave Secret.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/King-Shaves-Formula-Alpha-Shaving/dp/B00027DH3S/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1362494621&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;king+of+shaves+shaving+oil[[ASIN:B00027DH3S King of Shaves Formula Alpha Shaving Oil - .5 fl oz]]</li>
            <li> I use this as pre-shave and still use a badger brush and shaving cream, on top of it, it makes a huge difference and I have noticed a drastic decrease in any razor burn. I use a safety razor so I haven&#x27;t had any of my blades get clogged by it like others have mentioned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this as a pre-shave.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because it was recommended to me to use with my Merkur as a treatment for my razor. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s working, but it does last longer.</li>
            <li> I started using Shave Secret about 2 years ago.  I really like the shave I get with it. It is hard to believe that you only need 5 drops.  One bottle will provide months of shaving making it great for trips, esp. in the new world where carrying liquids through airport security is so much fun.  I highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Buy it! I&#x27;ve been shaving for over 20 years and have tried gels, foam, shaving soaps and even other shaving oils. This stuff is the best thing I&#x27;ve ever used. I first bought it at Walmart but they don&#x27;t sell it at the store by me anymore. If for some reason it&#x27;s not working that well for you at least use it as a base. Put it on first and then use the gel or foam on top of it.</li>
            <li> Met a claims which had been made for it.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and thought it would be worth giving this a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow the instructions and you will experience a unique shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A shave for the very first time with SHAVE SECRET was effortless, painless and incredibly smooth during and after.  But what surprised me the most was that I had achieved this despite shaving on a day I would usually give my face a rest as was starting to get a bit bumpy from the week.  I use a double sided safety razor with Asrta Platinum blades (my favorite).  Yet again my shaving experience has improved.  This doesn&#x27;t mean I&#x27;ll stop using shaving foam, because there are some great foam products out there also.  Shave Secret is quite something and I&#x27;m looking forward to using it.</li>
            <li> I had forgone shaving for years, opting for stubble instead. My skin is sensitive, and my chin is pointy and dimpled, and shaving is a pain. I usually cut myself, especially with my old-school \\&quot;safety razor\\&quot;, with the double-edged blades. But I&#x27;ve been getting more conservative haircuts lately, and I wanted a conservative shave to go with it. I had heard that pre-shave oil helps smooth things out, but I didn&#x27;t want to spend $25 on a tiny vial of designer stuff, so I tried olive oil before my shaving cream. It worked okay, but then I saw this stuff online, and figured I couldn&#x27;t go wrong at the price. It&#x27;s amazing! Using just 5 drops and no shaving cream I can get a super close shave. I can see what I&#x27;m doing. I smell good - not a strong smell, but pleasant and masculine. I&#x27;m completely sold. I&#x27;m going to put some in my dad&#x27;s Christmas stocking.</li>
            <li> I have seen many gimmicks out there but Shave Secret is the real deal. For 25 years I have had to put up with nasty razor burn that itched and burned my neck. Friends would often comment how bad the rash around my neck looked. I tried different things, I even went to the expensive brushes hoping it would help. After trying many different methods I came to the conclusion that it must be due to the collard shirts and tie that I am required to wear for my profession. After 2 weeks of using this product, My Razor burn disappeared. It took me a couple of days to get used to the shaving experience of not having foam all over my face but I am never going back to the old way. This product genuinely changed my life.</li>
            <li> May 10, 2013:&lt;br /&gt;Used for 6 months with Fusion razor, then purchased two more, and shipped to my Father and Brother.&lt;br /&gt;Enough said!</li>
            <li> I get a better shave from this than expensive gels, and it&#x27;s cheaper and easier to clean up after as well. Be sure to spread it evenly and thoroughly to avoid missing a spot. Worst drawback for me is that I lose track of what&#x27;s already been shaved without the foam to use as a guide.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work. I tried it for a whole week, and it gave me razor burn twice! Still recovering from my ill purchase... razor burn is such a pain!</li>
            <li> Well I tried it. I thought it wasn&#x27;t going to work. I shaved my face and......it the best shave ever!!!!</li>
            <li> Cleanest shave ever. My razor blades last for months. Better than any other product I have tried.</li>
            <li> A little expensive for this product, but I was aware of the price when I ordered it. Just cannot find it in my local stores anymore. Product is perfect and works great, I hope they didn&#x27;t stop producing it!</li>
