            <li>The best toothbrush ever.</li>
            <li>this is a great toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>is good for me as I use go with a medium/hard bristled toothbrush.</li>
            <li>my teeth, however feel superior afterwards..</li>
            <li>Sure!</li>
            <li>As described, love it!</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t speak to the brush helping with whitening as I kind of felt like</li>
            <li>No, I don&#x27;t suck - this product kind of does.</li>
            <li>So if you have some teeth that need a good scrub, then get this toothbrush and enjoy!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not so easy to get a grip on the brush, making a thorough brushing kind of a chore.</li>
            <li>Will be purchasing more of these.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s neat, but doesn&#x27;t look as elegant as in the photos.</li>
            <li>I am a fool for paying more than $.25 for it.</li>
            <li>Great little toothbrush and the brush size is a perfect fit for getting into back areas if your teeth.</li>
            <li>for functionality, it&#x27;s great until you start the actual brushing of the teeth.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really see any difference between this and the kind of toothbrush a hotel would give you if you forgot yours.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush is fine, but it&#x27;s nothing special.</li>
            <li>It feels and looks super cheap in person- on here looked nicer.</li>
            <li>I use a baking soda, fluoride toothpaste and along with this and flossing feel like I get my teeth REALLY CLEAN.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is amazing and does exactly what it says, you can certainly feel the difference on your teeth, tongue,</li>
            <li>brush head could have been a little softer but still great</li>
            <li>I thought it would be worth the money, but it wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li>Just what my grandson ordered for Christmas, thanks!</li>
            <li>The bristle constitution (first and hopefully</li>
            <li>that was mumbo jumbo in the first place.</li>
            <li>If the brush head were bigger that would be better, in my opionion , but the brush still gets the job done well.</li>
            <li>The brush is great since the head is small enough to fit all areas of your mouth.</li>
            <li>I really do like the size of the brush.</li>
            <li>Either way, I really would recommend this brush and do plan to buy this type whenever I need a new toothbrush.</li>
            <li>It does have a small head, but that&#x27;s great for navigating the upper gumline in the back of my mouth.</li>
            <li>Granted the brush is plastic but the picture made it look nicer and more matte or at least fancy shiny instead of dollar store shiny.</li>
            <li>high quality and lasts for a long time.  </li>
            <li>But feels like a cheap hard plastic tooth brush.</li>
            <li>When I first saw this toothbrush I thought blah because of the black color.</li>
            <li>The first day or so, my gums seemed a little sore.</li>

            <li> Some tribes use charcoal to brush their teeth. The brush is great since the head is small enough to fit all areas of your mouth.</li>
            <li> Just what my grandson ordered for Christmas, thanks!</li>
            <li> this is a great toothbrush.  high quality and lasts for a long time.  Will be purchasing more of these.</li>
            <li> Coolest looking toothbrush. So stealthy. It does have a small head, but that&#x27;s great for navigating the upper gumline in the back of my mouth. No complaints!</li>
            <li> Great little toothbrush and the brush size is a perfect fit for getting into back areas if your teeth.</li>
            <li> I have issues with this toothbrush. Aesthetically, the brush was too shiny and plastic looking. Granted the brush is plastic but the picture made it look nicer and more matte or at least fancy shiny instead of dollar store shiny. Does that make sense?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for functionality, it&#x27;s great until you start the actual brushing of the teeth. Because of said shiny plastic it&#x27;s not so easy to get a grip on the brush, making a thorough brushing kind of a chore. The bristle constitution (first and hopefully only time I&#x27;ll ever combine those two words) is good for me as I use go with a medium/hard bristled toothbrush. Last but not least the head and small and the bristle length is uniform which makes it a bit of a challenge to get into the nooks and crannies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t speak to the brush helping with whitening as I kind of felt like that was mumbo jumbo in the first place. Maybe I suck and just wanted a black version of my $7 dollar Colgate brush? No, I don&#x27;t suck - this product kind of does.</li>
            <li> Tiny head. Shoddy construction. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was not impressed. The bristles actually were too rough on my gums. I had a sore spot from them. I thought it would be worth the money, but it wasn&#x27;t. Not buying again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s black, and has a small head-so far I don&#x27;t get the novelty.  Can&#x27;t really see any difference between this and the kind of toothbrush a hotel would give you if you forgot yours.</li>
            <li> Hard Core Toothbrush, For Sure! If you need to scrub the s*** out of your teeth, then this is the toothbrush for you. The bristles on this toothbrush is as hard as a male inmate locked up in the Corcoran, Ca State Prison. I&#x27;m just using this toothbrush when I travel now, because the bristles don&#x27;t bend or mash down in my toiletry bag. So if you have some teeth that need a good scrub, then get this toothbrush and enjoy!</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is fine, but it&#x27;s nothing special. It&#x27;s neat, but doesn&#x27;t look as elegant as in the photos. The charcoal element of the toothbrush doesn&#x27;t appear to have any effect whatsoever on either the health of my teeth/mouth, or their whiteness. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li> It feels and looks super cheap in person- on here looked nicer. But feels like a cheap hard plastic tooth brush. It brushes well, however after using it for a couple months my mouth is completely tore up from the extremely firm bristles! Never felt this feeling on my gums and mouth from a toothbrush only from capt crunch but then I usually use soft brushes. my teeth, however feel superior afterwards.. Just don&#x27;t like the way the rest of my mouth feels. Not a total waste of 8 dollars. Would NOT recommend but I could just have an allergic reaction if that&#x27;s possible. No joke took a month for my mouth to heal from this brush.</li>
            <li> As described, love it!</li>
            <li> just what I was looking for. brush head could have been a little softer but still great</li>
            <li> Smaller head reaches places other brushes can&#x27;t and it saves on toothpaste too!</li>
            <li> Saw this item @ another site that does monthly box, pay as you go, read the review and figured I would give it a go. I purchased in blue and black.  This toothbrush is amazing and does exactly what it says, you can certainly feel the difference on your teeth, tongue, whatever else you brush, hours later, my teeth feel cleaner and I feel that my breath stays fresher, longer.  I use a baking soda, fluoride toothpaste and along with this and flossing feel like I get my teeth REALLY CLEAN. If the brush head were bigger that would be better, in my opionion , but the brush still gets the job done well.</li>
            <li> The best toothbrush ever.</li>
            <li> This item is a joke.  Poorly designed and cheaply made.  I am a fool for paying more than $.25 for it.</li>
            <li> My coworker has the whitest teeth I&#x27;ve ever seen. As white as copy paper and he credits it to this brush so I bought one.</li>
            <li> When I first saw this toothbrush I thought blah because of the black color. Yes, I know that was in the description but to see a black toothbrush in person was definitely different.  I really do like the size of the brush. The first day or so, my gums seemed a little sore. However, maybe it was the way I brush. Either way, I really would recommend this brush and do plan to buy this type whenever I need a new toothbrush.</li>
