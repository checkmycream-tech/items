            <li>This conditioner is amazing.</li>
            <li>The Wen products are absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>; conditioner it is amazing.</li>
            <li>I will continue to purchase all wens however because it is some kind of miracle in a bottle.</li>
            <li>Plus, who wants to rinse that awesome aroma out of their hair!!</li>
            <li>I honestly thought those people were nuts...</li>
            <li>Nice light scent and leaves my hair in great condition.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for this wonderful product Chaz Dean!</li>
            <li>My daughter uses this kind of hair care.  </li>
            <li>Nice scent.</li>
            <li>Since it mostly a hair conditioning product, my normally fly away hair is more under control.</li>
            <li>Smells nice.  </li>
            <li>Wen is good, but this scent is not my favorite.</li>
            <li>Once I did that, I have to say, my hair has never looked or smelled so nice.  </li>
            <li>LOVE IT, SMELLS SO GOOD</li>
            <li>this smelled really nice</li>
            <li>but I really liked this</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it!!!</li>
            <li>My hair feels clean, smells great</li>
            <li>My hair has been happy with Sweet Almond Mint</li>
            <li>this new summer scent is perfect.</li>
            <li>~ rinses very easily</li>
            <li>Going natural is a challenge for women who have always used chemicals to process their hair, but WEN is the best product to help you transition.</li>
            <li>It smells great and leaves hair manageable and looking full and healthy.</li>
            <li>I love, love, love it!  </li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li>Great seller and they ship very fast.</li>
            <li>I have had people walk up to me at a store and tell me my hair is beautiful Thanks to Wen.</li>
            <li>Very light Product, smells yummy</li>
            <li>The fragrance is VERY LIGHT.  </li>
            <li>Smells nice, not too strong.</li>
            <li>My hair has more volume and is much more manageable.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell if it is authentic</li>
            <li>but I love the smell and use it anyway.</li>
            <li>While it does add some volume and body to my hair, my favorite thing about it is that I can go two and sometimes three days without washing my hair.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t use this more than a month in my shampoo rotation though, as it makes my hair look greasy.</li>
            <li>This scent is in the top three.</li>
            <li>Love this smell and it doesn&#x27;t drive out my hair</li>
            <li>Love the product.</li>
            <li>Love Wen products!&lt;br /&gt;Timely delivery</li>
            <li>My favorite of all the Wen I tried.</li>
            <li>I love this scent and will be buying this again</li>
            <li>Love this.  </li>
            <li>Much better than the fig.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love Wen conditioning shampoos.  </li>
            <li>The smell is the best, I hope it is back soon.</li>
            <li>Love the smell in my hair, and softness.</li>
            <li>My favorite of all..</li>
            <li>My budget allowed this magnificent product, finally.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still the same wonderful product.  </li>
            <li>This cleansing conditioner is fabulous!  </li>
            <li>Alot of 2 in 1 shampoo conditioners leave me with static flyaways, but Wen keeps all static out of my hair.  </li>
            <li>The Spring Orange Blossom smell is fabulous!</li>
            <li>I was hoping to love it, because I really love the scent of orange blossom.  </li>
            <li>I love it and will reorder</li>
            <li>I love the smell of it</li>
            <li>I love how Wen makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t love the price.</li>
            <li>Not one of my favorite scents.</li>
            <li>I have been using WEN for about 3 months now, and I love it.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>refreshing</li>
            <li>and I simply love it.</li>
            <li>I love this product and how it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li>and like the info- mercial says, the longer you leave it on the better.</li>
            <li>I alternate this with others but it smells great!</li>
            <li>The hair looks so healthy, people notice the difference.</li>
            <li>Love the Smell and it works on my curls like a dream</li>
            <li>but the more I use them and realized they are &amp;#34;cleansing&amp;#34</li>
            <li>Love the product n</li>
            <li>Works fantastic product!</li>
            <li>I decided to try it anyway, and love it.</li>
            <li>Smells more to me like gardenia/honeysuckle.</li>
            <li>I love WEN cleansing conditioner.</li>
            <li>I love this scent.</li>
            <li>Love WEN products but the scent on this one is not to my liking.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>Makes my color-treated hair feel silky smooth!</li>
            <li>We have been using this product for about 6 months, nothing better.  </li>
            <li>I love Wen hair products.  </li>
            <li>I love the scent.</li>
            <li>Its fantastic!  </li>
            <li>My family agrees with me that it smells more like honey suckle then orange blossom.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and the way it makes my hair feel.  </li>
            <li>the scent is just okay.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this blend.  </li>
            <li>Wife loves this conditioner and was able to get it cheaper here than elsewhere.</li>
            <li>Love the smell.  </li>
            <li>Love the Wen spring orange conditioning cleansing it gives my hair.</li>
            <li>Love the scent and way</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Love the product but not this scent.</li>
            <li>Nice and light spring-y scent.</li>
            <li>Love it, Buy it</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>I liked the clean scent this product gave my hair.  </li>
            <li>Smells pretty good, but I found that this variety is more drying on my hair</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty good if you wash twice like it recommends.  </li>
            <li>Awesome fragrance...makes my hair feel cleaner than anything I&#x27;ve tried in a long time.</li>
            <li>The product arrived in great shape, it really was a smooth transaction and price</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care if he&#x27;s gay, I love his products...</li>
            <li>the product smell wasn&#x27;t appealing to me, and it didn&#x27;t do well on my fine hair.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I would love to see a WEN that is fragrance free.</li>
            <li>Works wonderfully like all of the other WEN products.  </li>
            <li>When she is out and has to use something else, she says her hair isn&#x27;t as easy to manage.</li>
            <li>TOO WIERD SMELLING,TOO STRONG</li>
            <li>Way too strong</li>
            <li>Smells amazing and works great like the other originsls</li>
            <li>I color treat my 46 year old chestnut brown hair, and this stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li>I have been using the sweet almond cleansing conditioner for years, I love the scent of the Orange Blossom.  </li>
            <li>My hair is soft, shiny, bouncy, full, smells great, and feels healthy and clean.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this because the first couple of times using it, my hair felt great.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of fine hair and this product just didn&#x27;t deliver.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair but nearing 40.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really smell like orange blossoms, but it does have a nice floral fragrance that, while strong in the bottle, doesn&#x27;t leave your hair overly perfumey.  </li>
            <li>Your hair is very manageable and has a really nice sheen.  </li>
            <li>Smells more fresh than citrus.</li>
            <li>than that it is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I love being able to just do &amp;#34;one step&amp;#34; and have it really work.</li>
            <li>So far so good</li>
            <li>The main difference is that the Wen costs 20X more!</li>
            <li>I always love the seasonal scents by chaz Dean,  but this one is a particular favorite of mine.</li>
            <li>Quite unique for a company to come up with something that delivers.</li>
            <li>I will admit though, that I wash my hair first with another favorite shampoo, then put the Wen on and work it in well, leave it on for about 3 or 4 minutes then rinse it out.  </li>
            <li>Seems thinner than the original</li>
            <li>is budget friendly.  </li>
            <li>Great product to have on hand and use every once in awhile, as it really does make your hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>My hair never feels clean after use.</li>
            <li>My hair has never felt so clean or bouncy.</li>
            <li>My hair never feels clean.</li>
            <li>Would probably work great for someone with truly dry hair (not dryness from damage).</li>
            <li>My faves are Orange Blossom, Spring Gardenia, and the original Sweet Almond Mint.</li>
            <li>My fine fly away hair now has body without being weighed down.</li>
            <li>It works better, is a non-lathering silicone, paraban-free formula, my hair is smooth and never frizzy with Devacare and my hair doesn&#x27;t fall out anymore than the normal shedding I experience when brushing or combing my hair.</li>
            <li>Great product but the smell is not what I expected.</li>
            <li>my friend loves it her hair seems better and don&#x27;t fall out as much.</li>
            <li>I would write a whole lot more reviews if we didn&#x27;t have to use 400 characters on every review.</li>
            <li>How sweet can that be?</li>
            <li>and I only buy really good product for my hair.  </li>
            <li>The smell is intense when smelling the bottle but is more mild when applied to hair.</li>
            <li>Since the first time using this, it has been easy to manage.  </li>
            <li>this smells great but does not work like the other WEN products.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what more to say, except I stopped using it and went back to DevaCare, which I love.</li>
            <li>this particular one is even better than the six thirteen, I think it slips better and it seemed thicker to me, although the six thirteen smells a little better, this is still pretty nice</li>
            <li>This scent is definitely my favorite by far and on my buy again list!</li>
            <li>Feels so healthy and soft!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed any huge difference, but I&#x27;m a senior and really can&#x27;t expect miracles.  </li>
            <li>I have used WEN for a few years and this is just another of their great products.</li>
            <li>has a nice smell, however I will go back to the cucumber aloe cleansing conditioner.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair soft but was hoping for more of a lingering orange blossom scent to my hair</li>
            <li>I have 1 bottle left, and will try to use it, but just wanted to put this out there as kind of an \\&quot;fyi\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pricey, but worth it</li>
            <li>So far I love all of the Wen shampoos.</li>
            <li>, it might actually be worth the money, once I figured out to use it.  </li>
            <li>Wonderfully fragrant without being overowering, rich, thick and makes your hair feel soft and silky.</li>
            <li>I found that about 9 pumps works about right for my shoulder length hair</li>
            <li>I am excited to try other kind of WEN hair care products.</li>
            <li>usual great performance of a wen product.</li>
            <li>My daughter has a lot of thick, beautiful hair</li>
            <li>the shipping is super fast</li>
            <li>I have tried several different Wen cleansing solutions and this one is great.  </li>
            <li>For the first time in many years i do not need any additional product and I have wavy/frizzy hair naturally and use a flat iron most days.  </li>
            <li>My hair feels bouncier and healthier very much</li>
            <li>It actually looks better each day AFTER a washing.  </li>
            <li>My hair color is lasting better, also.</li>
            <li>I love Wen above all others.</li>
            <li>For current Wen users: Love the scent.</li>
            <li>I have tried four different ones and the Spring Orange Blossom is definitely my favorite.</li>
            <li>First of all, this does not smell like oranges.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m back to using Trader Joe shampoo and conditioner, and for 1/4 of the price I&#x27;m seeing better results.</li>
            <li>I love WEN but for some reason this one doesn&#x27;t work the same.</li>
            <li>And no one paid me to type this ;)    </li>
            <li>I really like the fresh orange blossom scent.</li>
            <li>Is it better than standard shampoo and conditioner?</li>
            <li>But I prefer the mint which was my first purchase from Chaz.</li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t think so</li>
            <li>Smells so pretty-</li>
            <li>I first started using Wen from a trial order deal that was inexpensive and packed with goodies.</li>
            <li>pretty scent</li>
            <li>When I first got this product I was amazed at the smell.  </li>
            <li>Then I googled EXACTLY how to use the product.  </li>
            <li>the first time I used it my sister bought it to the beach</li>
            <li>The reason I never bought it was I don&#x27;t like being tied to a contract type deal and not knowing exactly what the product and shipment will cost....</li>
            <li>My hair smells and looks so pretty.  </li>
            <li>Day two though my hair still looks and smell pretty.</li>
            <li>I tried really hard to dislike Wen, but it  really does make my hair look and feel great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a great fresh and fruity smell, but not too strong or artificial smelling.</li>
            <li>WEN leaves my hair soft, clean and I am not loosing my hair after using this product.  </li>
            <li>This works well as long as I dont rise it too thoroughly - just mostly rinsed.</li>
            <li>This was the first time I bought a Wen product - not real excited to buy any more.</li>
            <li>I have always had very high maintenance hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Edited to add this issue:&lt;br /&gt;OK, been using this a while...just finishing up my second bottle, and I am beginning to get large bumps on my scalp a lot of the time, kind of like big pimples!  </li>
            <li>I was very hopeful of this cleansing conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used them on and off for a while and really like the results.</li>
            <li>and it really does increase hair shedding dramatically.</li>
            <li>I rinse very well, so that is not the issue.  </li>
            <li>My hair is much smoother and fuller by using herbal essence.</li>
            <li>I really should order this by the gallon.</li>
            <li>or you&#x27;re using too much as a leave-in conditioner.</li>
            <li>Thanks...</li>
            <li>I much prefer the pomegranate version.</li>
            <li>Just as much hair fell out in the shower.  </li>
            <li>Got it for my sister as a gift, and she says she absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>so I try different fragrances when available.</li>
            <li>It was a bit unusual to shampoo my hair without the bubbles but this product works really well for me.  </li>
            <li>The part about Wen I dislike was the membership program and how much the product costs after the trial order.</li>
            <li>I prefer the Chaz Dean Cucumber and Aloe which works really well on my hair.  </li>
            <li>, I think it just costs too much for &amp;#34;soap&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Did not use as much as recommended.</li>
            <li>I really prefer the fig, summer mango coconut, and fall apple spice.</li>
            <li>Really like it.  </li>
            <li>Really smells like orange blossoms But not too overpowering.</li>
            <li>The first new scent I like as well as the lavender.</li>
            <li>I agree with others in that the texture of this one is not the same as  some of the original formulations.</li>
            <li>But the price is so high and having to use so much</li>
            <li>The performance of this cleansing conditioner is amazing, as usual.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting this and as far as I&#x27;m concerned this, in and of itself, is worth the product: my hair has almost completely stopped falling out!</li>
            <li>Never wrote a review in my live!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to wash my hair so often which is better, less drying.  </li>
            <li>This product has a tiny citrus scent, which disappears quickly and leaves my hair smelling like funky chemicals.</li>
            <li>I get them on the sides, top and occasionally on the back of my head.  </li>
            <li>So I won&#x27;t be ordering this particular one again.</li>
            <li>I love Wen and will continue to use it - they definitely make my curly hair feel softer than regular shampoos and conditioners.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend if you are a Wen fan.</li>
            <li>High quality ingredients.</li>
            <li>but your hair doesn&#x27;t stay clean as long, need to wash twice as often as shampoo.</li>
            <li>My hair did not look, smell or feel clean and the fragrance was strange.</li>
            <li>This scent is a little too flowery for me, but I love how it makes my hair look and feel.</li>
            <li>I seen it on Amazon and ordered it the price is a little more then I can afford</li>
            <li>I would suggest small sample packages for persons to try before buying a large bottle, that way they would be able to choose which one they prefer.</li>
            <li>and it really keeps my hair soft after&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I thought maybe it was just normal shedding from washing my hair, but for some reason it must not have come out in the shower like normal.</li>
            <li>Nice and thick, too.  </li>
            <li>For years I have kept my hair super long as the weight made my hair flatten somewhat.  </li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t leave my hair as silky smooth as some of the other Wen scents</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>Live these products.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very nice the first few times you use it, then it starts to make my hair lifeless and dull.</li>
            <li>Product smells nice but left my hair feeling waxy and heavy.</li>
            <li>Smells wonderful just too heavy for my thin hair.</li>
            <li>Now I am keeping it long because it is actually pretty!  </li>
            <li>but, the first time I used Wen, I went on a date about an hour later.</li>
            <li>I actually watched in the infomercial yesterday after using the product for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My first Wen product and I see a big improvement in my hair!</li>
            <li>Yes it&#x27;s way cheaper but at the same time you are not getting the same product as the full priced product from the wen website.</li>
            <li>The only 2 negatives are, its a bit pricey... and it might make a person shower a little longer, because the longer its on your hair, the better it is for your hair.  </li>
            <li>I have short hair, so I didn&#x27;t think it would have much effect on my hair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still gray but it is soft and manageable now.</li>
            <li>The only reason I wanted to try Wen was for a different scent, but now I think Wen is overpriced, doesn&#x27;t leave the hair as smooth as similar products...</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is my least favorite Wen formulation.  </li>
            <li>My hair became soft after one use.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>on while you shower, then rinse completely and apply 1-2 pumps as a conditioner</li>
            <li>a whole gallon jug--and boy do I wish I had it back now!!!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read many negative reviews about Wen products.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my hair soft.</li>
            <li>and she loves the soft scent.</li>
            <li>After a few uses, it left the top of my head feeling greasy, even after thoroughly rinsing and not putting in any as a leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li>It is not less frizzy.  </li>
            <li>I self color and had pretty much chemically killed it</li>
            <li>I have tried a few of the Wen cleansers and this one is good, but definitely not my favorite scent -</li>
            <li>I normally use the almond mint but wanted to try a different scent -</li>
            <li>I have very fine thin hair</li>
            <li>I like the product but use it about a 3rd of the time and not near as much as it says.</li>
            <li>I spent so much money on this order</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started co-washing my natural hair several years ago.  </li>
            <li>WEN is the only product I have found that has made my hair look and feel soft and not frizzy.</li>
            <li>It seems thinner and leaves my hair much drier than my other WEN ever has.  </li>
            <li>In reading some of the other comments it seems that some people expect it to smell like the fruit orange; it really smells like the flower that becomes the orange.</li>
            <li>It did not dry faster.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed getting Wen products on this site are a little hit or miss - some seem to be of a higher quality than others.</li>
            <li>I have done a lot of reading about this, and apparently a lot of people are experiencing the same thing.  </li>
            <li>I actually use this product as a body wash - it does not dry the skin at all like soap or body washes.</li>
            <li>The second ingredient is alcohol--how can it NOT dry out your hair??  </li>
            <li>The first time I used the WEN product, my hair came out tangled, limp, and flat.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> ; conditioner it is amazing.</li>
            <li> I will continue to purchase all wens however because it is some kind of miracle in a bottle.</li>
            <li> Plus, who wants to rinse that awesome aroma out of their hair!!</li>
            <li> I honestly thought those people were nuts...</li>
            <li> Nice light scent and leaves my hair in great condition.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for this wonderful product Chaz Dean!</li>
            <li> My daughter uses this kind of hair care.  </li>
            <li> Nice scent.</li>
            <li> Since it mostly a hair conditioning product, my normally fly away hair is more under control.</li>
            <li> Smells nice.  </li>
            <li> Wen is good, but this scent is not my favorite.</li>
            <li> Once I did that, I have to say, my hair has never looked or smelled so nice.  </li>
            <li> LOVE IT, SMELLS SO GOOD</li>
            <li> this smelled really nice</li>
            <li> but I really liked this</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it!!!</li>
            <li> My hair feels clean, smells great</li>
            <li> My hair has been happy with Sweet Almond Mint</li>
            <li> this new summer scent is perfect.</li>
            <li> ~ rinses very easily</li>
            <li> Going natural is a challenge for women who have always used chemicals to process their hair, but WEN is the best product to help you transition.</li>
            <li> It smells great and leaves hair manageable and looking full and healthy.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love it!  </li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> Great seller and they ship very fast.</li>
            <li> I have had people walk up to me at a store and tell me my hair is beautiful Thanks to Wen.</li>
            <li> Very light Product, smells yummy</li>
            <li> The fragrance is VERY LIGHT.  </li>
            <li> Smells nice, not too strong.</li>
            <li> My hair has more volume and is much more manageable.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell if it is authentic</li>
            <li> but I love the smell and use it anyway.</li>
            <li> While it does add some volume and body to my hair, my favorite thing about it is that I can go two and sometimes three days without washing my hair.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use this more than a month in my shampoo rotation though, as it makes my hair look greasy.</li>
            <li> This scent is in the top three.</li>
            <li> Love this smell and it doesn&#x27;t drive out my hair</li>
            <li> Love the product.</li>
            <li> Love Wen products!&lt;br /&gt;Timely delivery</li>
            <li> My favorite of all the Wen I tried.</li>
            <li> I love this scent and will be buying this again</li>
            <li> Love this.  </li>
            <li> Much better than the fig.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love Wen conditioning shampoos.  </li>
            <li> The smell is the best, I hope it is back soon.</li>
            <li> Love the smell in my hair, and softness.</li>
            <li> My favorite of all..</li>
            <li> My budget allowed this magnificent product, finally.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still the same wonderful product.  </li>
            <li> This cleansing conditioner is fabulous!  </li>
            <li> Alot of 2 in 1 shampoo conditioners leave me with static flyaways, but Wen keeps all static out of my hair.  </li>
            <li> The Spring Orange Blossom smell is fabulous!</li>
            <li> I was hoping to love it, because I really love the scent of orange blossom.  </li>
            <li> I love it and will reorder</li>
            <li> I love the smell of it</li>
            <li> I love how Wen makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t love the price.</li>
            <li> Not one of my favorite scents.</li>
            <li> I have been using WEN for about 3 months now, and I love it.  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> refreshing</li>
            <li> and I simply love it.</li>
            <li> I love this product and how it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li> and like the info- mercial says, the longer you leave it on the better.</li>
            <li> I alternate this with others but it smells great!</li>
            <li> The hair looks so healthy, people notice the difference.</li>
            <li> Love the Smell and it works on my curls like a dream</li>
            <li> but the more I use them and realized they are &amp;#34;cleansing&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Love the product n</li>
            <li> Works fantastic product!</li>
            <li> I decided to try it anyway, and love it.</li>
            <li> Smells more to me like gardenia/honeysuckle.</li>
            <li> I love WEN cleansing conditioner.</li>
            <li> I love this scent.</li>
            <li> Love WEN products but the scent on this one is not to my liking.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li> Makes my color-treated hair feel silky smooth!</li>
            <li> We have been using this product for about 6 months, nothing better.  </li>
            <li> I love Wen hair products.  </li>
            <li> I love the scent.</li>
            <li> Its fantastic!  </li>
            <li> My family agrees with me that it smells more like honey suckle then orange blossom.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and the way it makes my hair feel.  </li>
            <li> the scent is just okay.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I love this blend.  </li>
            <li> Wife loves this conditioner and was able to get it cheaper here than elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Love the smell.  </li>
            <li> Love the Wen spring orange conditioning cleansing it gives my hair.</li>
            <li> Love the scent and way</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> Love the product but not this scent.</li>
            <li> Nice and light spring-y scent.</li>
            <li> Love it, Buy it</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> I liked the clean scent this product gave my hair.  </li>
            <li> Smells pretty good, but I found that this variety is more drying on my hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty good if you wash twice like it recommends.  </li>
            <li> Awesome fragrance...makes my hair feel cleaner than anything I&#x27;ve tried in a long time.</li>
            <li> The product arrived in great shape, it really was a smooth transaction and price</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care if he&#x27;s gay, I love his products...</li>
            <li> the product smell wasn&#x27;t appealing to me, and it didn&#x27;t do well on my fine hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I would love to see a WEN that is fragrance free.</li>
            <li> Works wonderfully like all of the other WEN products.  </li>
            <li> When she is out and has to use something else, she says her hair isn&#x27;t as easy to manage.</li>
            <li> TOO WIERD SMELLING,TOO STRONG</li>
            <li> Way too strong</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and works great like the other originsls</li>
            <li> I color treat my 46 year old chestnut brown hair, and this stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li> I have been using the sweet almond cleansing conditioner for years, I love the scent of the Orange Blossom.  </li>
            <li> My hair is soft, shiny, bouncy, full, smells great, and feels healthy and clean.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this because the first couple of times using it, my hair felt great.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of fine hair and this product just didn&#x27;t deliver.  </li>
            <li> I have fine hair but nearing 40.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really smell like orange blossoms, but it does have a nice floral fragrance that, while strong in the bottle, doesn&#x27;t leave your hair overly perfumey.  </li>
            <li> Your hair is very manageable and has a really nice sheen.  </li>
            <li> Smells more fresh than citrus.</li>
            <li> than that it is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I love being able to just do &amp;#34;one step&amp;#34; and have it really work.</li>
            <li> So far so good</li>
            <li> The main difference is that the Wen costs 20X more!</li>
            <li> I always love the seasonal scents by chaz Dean,  but this one is a particular favorite of mine.</li>
            <li> Quite unique for a company to come up with something that delivers.</li>
            <li> I will admit though, that I wash my hair first with another favorite shampoo, then put the Wen on and work it in well, leave it on for about 3 or 4 minutes then rinse it out.  </li>
            <li> Seems thinner than the original</li>
            <li> is budget friendly.  </li>
            <li> Great product to have on hand and use every once in awhile, as it really does make your hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> My hair never feels clean after use.</li>
            <li> My hair has never felt so clean or bouncy.</li>
            <li> My hair never feels clean.</li>
            <li> Would probably work great for someone with truly dry hair (not dryness from damage).</li>
            <li> My faves are Orange Blossom, Spring Gardenia, and the original Sweet Almond Mint.</li>
            <li> My fine fly away hair now has body without being weighed down.</li>
            <li> It works better, is a non-lathering silicone, paraban-free formula, my hair is smooth and never frizzy with Devacare and my hair doesn&#x27;t fall out anymore than the normal shedding I experience when brushing or combing my hair.</li>
            <li> Great product but the smell is not what I expected.</li>
            <li> my friend loves it her hair seems better and don&#x27;t fall out as much.</li>
            <li> I would write a whole lot more reviews if we didn&#x27;t have to use 400 characters on every review.</li>
            <li> How sweet can that be?</li>
            <li> and I only buy really good product for my hair.  </li>
            <li> The smell is intense when smelling the bottle but is more mild when applied to hair.</li>
            <li> Since the first time using this, it has been easy to manage.  </li>
            <li> this smells great but does not work like the other WEN products.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what more to say, except I stopped using it and went back to DevaCare, which I love.</li>
            <li> this particular one is even better than the six thirteen, I think it slips better and it seemed thicker to me, although the six thirteen smells a little better, this is still pretty nice</li>
            <li> This scent is definitely my favorite by far and on my buy again list!</li>
            <li> Feels so healthy and soft!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any huge difference, but I&#x27;m a senior and really can&#x27;t expect miracles.  </li>
            <li> I have used WEN for a few years and this is just another of their great products.</li>
            <li> has a nice smell, however I will go back to the cucumber aloe cleansing conditioner.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair soft but was hoping for more of a lingering orange blossom scent to my hair</li>
            <li> I have 1 bottle left, and will try to use it, but just wanted to put this out there as kind of an \\&quot;fyi\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pricey, but worth it</li>
            <li> So far I love all of the Wen shampoos.</li>
            <li> , it might actually be worth the money, once I figured out to use it.  </li>
            <li> Wonderfully fragrant without being overowering, rich, thick and makes your hair feel soft and silky.</li>
            <li> I found that about 9 pumps works about right for my shoulder length hair</li>
            <li> I am excited to try other kind of WEN hair care products.</li>
            <li> usual great performance of a wen product.</li>
            <li> My daughter has a lot of thick, beautiful hair</li>
            <li> the shipping is super fast</li>
            <li> I have tried several different Wen cleansing solutions and this one is great.  </li>
            <li> For the first time in many years i do not need any additional product and I have wavy/frizzy hair naturally and use a flat iron most days.  </li>
            <li> My hair feels bouncier and healthier very much</li>
            <li> It actually looks better each day AFTER a washing.  </li>
            <li> My hair color is lasting better, also.</li>
            <li> I love Wen above all others.</li>
            <li> For current Wen users: Love the scent.</li>
            <li> I have tried four different ones and the Spring Orange Blossom is definitely my favorite.</li>
            <li> First of all, this does not smell like oranges.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m back to using Trader Joe shampoo and conditioner, and for 1/4 of the price I&#x27;m seeing better results.</li>
            <li> I love WEN but for some reason this one doesn&#x27;t work the same.</li>
            <li> And no one paid me to type this ;)    </li>
            <li> I really like the fresh orange blossom scent.</li>
            <li> Is it better than standard shampoo and conditioner?</li>
            <li> But I prefer the mint which was my first purchase from Chaz.</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t think so</li>
            <li> Smells so pretty-</li>
            <li> I first started using Wen from a trial order deal that was inexpensive and packed with goodies.</li>
            <li> pretty scent</li>
            <li> When I first got this product I was amazed at the smell.  </li>
            <li> Then I googled EXACTLY how to use the product.  </li>
            <li> the first time I used it my sister bought it to the beach</li>
            <li> The reason I never bought it was I don&#x27;t like being tied to a contract type deal and not knowing exactly what the product and shipment will cost....</li>
            <li> My hair smells and looks so pretty.  </li>
            <li> Day two though my hair still looks and smell pretty.</li>
            <li> I tried really hard to dislike Wen, but it  really does make my hair look and feel great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a great fresh and fruity smell, but not too strong or artificial smelling.</li>
            <li> WEN leaves my hair soft, clean and I am not loosing my hair after using this product.  </li>
            <li> This works well as long as I dont rise it too thoroughly - just mostly rinsed.</li>
            <li> This was the first time I bought a Wen product - not real excited to buy any more.</li>
            <li> I have always had very high maintenance hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Edited to add this issue:&lt;br /&gt;OK, been using this a while...just finishing up my second bottle, and I am beginning to get large bumps on my scalp a lot of the time, kind of like big pimples!  </li>
            <li> I was very hopeful of this cleansing conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used them on and off for a while and really like the results.</li>
            <li> and it really does increase hair shedding dramatically.</li>
            <li> I rinse very well, so that is not the issue.  </li>
            <li> My hair is much smoother and fuller by using herbal essence.</li>
            <li> I really should order this by the gallon.</li>
            <li> or you&#x27;re using too much as a leave-in conditioner.</li>
            <li> Thanks...</li>
            <li> I much prefer the pomegranate version.</li>
            <li> Just as much hair fell out in the shower.  </li>
            <li> Got it for my sister as a gift, and she says she absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> so I try different fragrances when available.</li>
            <li> It was a bit unusual to shampoo my hair without the bubbles but this product works really well for me.  </li>
            <li> The part about Wen I dislike was the membership program and how much the product costs after the trial order.</li>
            <li> I prefer the Chaz Dean Cucumber and Aloe which works really well on my hair.  </li>
            <li> , I think it just costs too much for &amp;#34;soap&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Did not use as much as recommended.</li>
            <li> I really prefer the fig, summer mango coconut, and fall apple spice.</li>
            <li> Really like it.  </li>
            <li> Really smells like orange blossoms But not too overpowering.</li>
            <li> The first new scent I like as well as the lavender.</li>
            <li> I agree with others in that the texture of this one is not the same as  some of the original formulations.</li>
            <li> But the price is so high and having to use so much</li>
            <li> The performance of this cleansing conditioner is amazing, as usual.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting this and as far as I&#x27;m concerned this, in and of itself, is worth the product: my hair has almost completely stopped falling out!</li>
            <li> Never wrote a review in my live!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to wash my hair so often which is better, less drying.  </li>
            <li> This product has a tiny citrus scent, which disappears quickly and leaves my hair smelling like funky chemicals.</li>
            <li> I get them on the sides, top and occasionally on the back of my head.  </li>
            <li> So I won&#x27;t be ordering this particular one again.</li>
            <li> I love Wen and will continue to use it - they definitely make my curly hair feel softer than regular shampoos and conditioners.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend if you are a Wen fan.</li>
            <li> High quality ingredients.</li>
            <li> but your hair doesn&#x27;t stay clean as long, need to wash twice as often as shampoo.</li>
            <li> My hair did not look, smell or feel clean and the fragrance was strange.</li>
            <li> This scent is a little too flowery for me, but I love how it makes my hair look and feel.</li>
            <li> I seen it on Amazon and ordered it the price is a little more then I can afford</li>
            <li> I would suggest small sample packages for persons to try before buying a large bottle, that way they would be able to choose which one they prefer.</li>
            <li> and it really keeps my hair soft after&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I thought maybe it was just normal shedding from washing my hair, but for some reason it must not have come out in the shower like normal.</li>
            <li> Nice and thick, too.  </li>
            <li> For years I have kept my hair super long as the weight made my hair flatten somewhat.  </li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t leave my hair as silky smooth as some of the other Wen scents</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> Live these products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very nice the first few times you use it, then it starts to make my hair lifeless and dull.</li>
            <li> Product smells nice but left my hair feeling waxy and heavy.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful just too heavy for my thin hair.</li>
            <li> Now I am keeping it long because it is actually pretty!  </li>
            <li> but, the first time I used Wen, I went on a date about an hour later.</li>
            <li> I actually watched in the infomercial yesterday after using the product for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My first Wen product and I see a big improvement in my hair!</li>
            <li> Yes it&#x27;s way cheaper but at the same time you are not getting the same product as the full priced product from the wen website.</li>
            <li> The only 2 negatives are, its a bit pricey... and it might make a person shower a little longer, because the longer its on your hair, the better it is for your hair.  </li>
            <li> I have short hair, so I didn&#x27;t think it would have much effect on my hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still gray but it is soft and manageable now.</li>
            <li> The only reason I wanted to try Wen was for a different scent, but now I think Wen is overpriced, doesn&#x27;t leave the hair as smooth as similar products...</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is my least favorite Wen formulation.  </li>
            <li> My hair became soft after one use.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> on while you shower, then rinse completely and apply 1-2 pumps as a conditioner</li>
            <li> a whole gallon jug--and boy do I wish I had it back now!!!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read many negative reviews about Wen products.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my hair soft.</li>
            <li> and she loves the soft scent.</li>
            <li> After a few uses, it left the top of my head feeling greasy, even after thoroughly rinsing and not putting in any as a leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li> It is not less frizzy.  </li>
            <li> I self color and had pretty much chemically killed it</li>
            <li> I have tried a few of the Wen cleansers and this one is good, but definitely not my favorite scent -</li>
            <li> I normally use the almond mint but wanted to try a different scent -</li>
            <li> I have very fine thin hair</li>
            <li> I like the product but use it about a 3rd of the time and not near as much as it says.</li>
            <li> I spent so much money on this order</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started co-washing my natural hair several years ago.  </li>
            <li> WEN is the only product I have found that has made my hair look and feel soft and not frizzy.</li>
            <li> It seems thinner and leaves my hair much drier than my other WEN ever has.  </li>
            <li> In reading some of the other comments it seems that some people expect it to smell like the fruit orange; it really smells like the flower that becomes the orange.</li>
            <li> It did not dry faster.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed getting Wen products on this site are a little hit or miss - some seem to be of a higher quality than others.</li>
            <li> I have done a lot of reading about this, and apparently a lot of people are experiencing the same thing.  </li>
            <li> I actually use this product as a body wash - it does not dry the skin at all like soap or body washes.</li>
            <li> The second ingredient is alcohol--how can it NOT dry out your hair??  </li>
            <li> The first time I used the WEN product, my hair came out tangled, limp, and flat.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m upset because when I tried to purchase directly from Chaz Dean it was out of stock, and the bottle is not the same shape as other bottles I got from Chas Dean&#x27;s website.  </li>
            <li> No volume, no luminescence, just flat, limp, and heavy like it was full of goop.</li>
            <li> This smells very close to the smell when driving past orange groves in Florida.</li>
            <li> flat and</li>
            <li> but it has tended to be dry, especially at the ends.  </li>
            <li> my hair is super frizzy and thin since I started using Wen.</li>
            <li> Some of the Wen varieties are too thin and don&#x27;t seem to moisturize as well, but this one is nice and thick and hydrating.</li>
            <li> me assure you, I did not have the same &amp;#34;amazing&amp;#34; results after a single use.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work well for my fine hair unfortunately.</li>
            <li> My hair is definitely softer, but it is still just as frizzy and flat, which I expected Wen to combat.</li>
            <li> As the hair grew back, it looked untamed and very dry.  </li>
            <li> I have fine, thin hair and this does not weigh it down.  </li>
            <li> No matter how long I rinsed, my hair felt like it had a film on it</li>
            <li> the fragrance lasts for long time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Some have left my hair a greasy mess while others have totally changed my hair by adding volume and body.  </li>
            <li> but I must admit the reaction with this and my hair compared to other Wens was not the same.  </li>
            <li> It did seem to dry it out.  </li>
            <li> I color my hair and because of this the end are dry.</li>
            <li> Ends are dry and roots are oily.  </li>
            <li> To make matters worse, it leaves my hair much drier than the regular WEn</li>
            <li> My boyfriend and I also noticed that this product makes my hair greasy (which is odd for my hair) and the scent doesn&#x27;t last long after drying and straightening.</li>
            <li> I knew I would loose about 100 strands of hair.  </li>
            <li> Previously, I had to wash it daily</li>
            <li> I use much less than the 10 pumps recommended for short hair, which helps negate cost.</li>
            <li> My husbands hair was gray and very dry.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair to dry.... will be using other wen products....</li>
            <li> It is expensive but it was and is worth it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Left my hair feeling limp and oily.</li>
            <li> Second, I have naturally oily hair, and this product made it worse.</li>
            <li> However, in using the recommended number of &amp;#34;pumps&amp;#34;, I have used almost 3/4 of the bottle in less than two weeks (I have long hair).</li>
            <li> I like Wen products, this one seemed thinner than other Wen Conditioning shampoo.  </li>
            <li> None of his other products work and this no exception.  </li>
            <li> She doesn&#x27;t want any other brand.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this several times, and am still not sure if I like it.</li>
            <li> It did not work like any other &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; wen cleanser i purchased from wen.</li>
            <li> and they added other things to my order</li>
            <li> It left my hair very heavy and unmanageable.</li>
            <li> We tic.would like to see the price come down some but other</li>
            <li> My hair dresser told me she had heard the same complaint from some of her other clients that had used it.</li>
            <li> All the negative reviews are totally opposite of my experience.</li>
            <li> Average product.  </li>
            <li> Not worth $30 .</li>
            <li> You use at least 3-5 times as much as regular shampoo (according to directions).  </li>
            <li> Also..she has to do EKGs and it breaks down and removed the wax from her hair in moments.</li>
            <li> not overwhelming, just soft and subtle.</li>
            <li> those considering trying Wen: Less flyaway hair than shampoo</li>
            <li> I continued to use the product for about a week and a half.</li>
            <li> My hair is less frizzy and the color less washed out looking.</li>
            <li> Has a heavy scent, I use a little at a time, along with my other hair care products to boost their scent.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a true orange blossom.</li>
            <li> If your hair is dry, maybe your water is hard, you&#x27;re not using a bit as leave-in conditioner...</li>
            <li> little hands</li>
            <li> It is just a little pricey for the amount you receive.</li>
            <li> It might work well, but it smells pretty bad compared to other hair products.  </li>
            <li> so you can use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I wasted $30.</li>
            <li> Now that I can buy it on Amazon and not get trapped into an \\&quot;auto subscription\\&quot;, I will buy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s scent is harsh and has a chemical overtone.</li>
            <li> my narrow perspective</li>
            <li> My hair was very frizzy and the shedding became worse and worse.</li>
            <li> Having very thin, fine hair has been difficult because it just looks wispy.</li>
            <li> I guess I figured out why it&#x27;s too expensive for the average American.</li>
            <li> Is helping tame my frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t buy products from TV infomercials but a friend told me to try Wen.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I haven&#x27;t noticed any revolutionary changes in my hair after using daily during this time period.</li>
            <li> Not pleased with product.  </li>
            <li> Actually had friends ask what was wrong with my hair...</li>
            <li> cleansing conditioner works just as well as the Suave I usually use.  </li>
            <li> so expensive and a lot of different opinion on it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Amazon saved the day, per usual.</li>
            <li> After I asked, the wife said the Wen met her expectations as it has in her past use of the product.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> Leaves you hair very heavy, tried to give it away but all co - workers who tried it didn&#x27;t like it either.</li>
            <li> , I tried Wen again as a last resort before cutting off about 10 inches.</li>
            <li> I have thick somewhat frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> Subtle but  still orangey.</li>
            <li> Very thick almost balm like conditioner.</li>
            <li> Helpful secret.</li>
            <li> I am a little unhappy with how expensive this product is</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a good product at all!</li>
            <li> I used this product twice and was very disappointed with the way it left my hair feeling.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but I will not use this product.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical -</li>
            <li> I want to give this 5 stars, but deducted a star for the crazy price.</li>
            <li> Leave a film on my hair and makes my scalp itch like crazy.</li>
            <li> Sorry Wen!</li>
            <li> I was shedding so bad-</li>
            <li> Very disappointing...</li>
            <li> Very unpleasant.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Worst product I have ever used on my hair.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The only product i use</li>
            <li> Makes my hair to dry.... will be using other wen products.... not this one.....</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t buy products from TV infomercials but a friend told me to try Wen.  I have short hair, so I didn&#x27;t think it would have much effect on my hair.  But it does.  My hair has more volume and is much more manageable.  It actually looks better each day AFTER a washing.  I don&#x27;t have to wash my hair so often which is better, less drying.  My hair color is lasting better, also.</li>
            <li> Very light Product, smells yummy ~ rinses very easily</li>
            <li> I have been using Wen for a couple years now.&lt;br /&gt;It has definitely improved the condition of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;This has a nice smell, however I will go back to the cucumber aloe cleansing conditioner.</li>
            <li> Just received my package. Heavenly smell of orange blossoms. My fine fly away hair now has body without being weighed down. I use as a conditioner.</li>
            <li> This product does what it says it will.</li>
            <li> This does work great! My husbands hair was gray and very dry. It&#x27;s still gray but it is soft and manageable now.</li>
            <li> I used this product twice and was very disappointed with the way it left my hair feeling. No matter how long I rinsed, my hair felt like it had a film on it and I couldn&#x27;t do anything with it. When I mentioned it to my hairdresser he said that he has seen people have hair fall out after using Wen because it can plug up hair follicles. I know some people swear by it, so I guess each person has to decide for themselves, but it definitely did not work well for me! I&#x27;m gifting what&#x27;s left to the friend who recommended it to me.</li>
            <li> Best scent yet.  I&#x27;m upset because when I tried to purchase directly from Chaz Dean it was out of stock, and the bottle is not the same shape as other bottles I got from Chas Dean&#x27;s website.  I can&#x27;t tell if it is authentic but I love the smell and use it anyway.</li>
            <li> I had heard a lot about Wen but hadn&#x27;t tried it.  While it does add some volume and body to my hair, my favorite thing about it is that I can go two and sometimes three days without washing my hair.  Previously, I had to wash it daily so it would not become oily.  The fragrance is pleasing as well.</li>
            <li> I like it but, the ingrediets are not the same as when you purchase this from the actual site.</li>
            <li> Loved the smell. I can&#x27;t use this more than a month in my shampoo rotation though, as it makes my hair look greasy. Great product to have on hand and use every once in awhile, as it really does make your hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I love Wen above all others. This scent is in the top three.</li>
            <li> Love this smell and it doesn&#x27;t drive out my hair</li>
            <li> I have wanted to try Wen for a while but did not want to be signed up for automatic mailing and billing that the regular website requires. This product was comparable in price without the commitment of automatic billing. The orange blossom scent is wonderful, reminds me of honey suckle. However, in using the recommended number of &amp;#34;pumps&amp;#34;, I have used almost 3/4 of the bottle in less than two weeks (I have long hair). Unfortunately, I haven&#x27;t noticed any revolutionary changes in my hair after using daily during this time period. My hair is definitely softer, but it is still just as frizzy and flat, which I expected Wen to combat. My boyfriend and I also noticed that this product makes my hair greasy (which is odd for my hair) and the scent doesn&#x27;t last long after drying and straightening. I probably won&#x27;t continue to buy this product, as I cannot justify spending $35 on a product that doesn&#x27;t last or follow through with it&#x27;s promises, and that makes my hair greasy. Sorry Wen!</li>
            <li> Strong smell, but my hair looks excellent and is not breaking out my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would love to see a WEN that is fragrance free.</li>
            <li> Love the product. Chaz needs to sell in stores!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Love Wen products!&lt;br /&gt;Timely delivery</li>
            <li> Best hair product ever!</li>
            <li> My favorite of all the Wen I tried.</li>
            <li> Not pleased with product.  Actually had friends ask what was wrong with my hair...flat and the shiny is actually oil in hair.</li>
            <li> I love this scent and will be buying this again</li>
            <li> This is everything it says it is!  Quite unique for a company to come up with something that delivers.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the way my hair feels after using it. I spent so much money on this order, I won&#x27;t make that mistake again.</li>
            <li> I really do LOVE it, but it&#x27;s just tooooo expensive. Thus, the 4 stars. I will continue to purchase all wens however because it is some kind of miracle in a bottle. I guess I figured out why it&#x27;s too expensive for the average American. It&#x27;s worth it!!! lol</li>
            <li> Dude, you don&#x27;t even deserve a 1 star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://topclassactions.com/lawsuit-settlements/lawsuit-news/36648-class-action-lawsuit-wen-cleansing-conditioner-causes-hair-loss</li>
            <li> Love this.  Is helping tame my frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> After a few uses, it left the top of my head feeling greasy, even after thoroughly rinsing and not putting in any as a leave in conditioner. My hair dresser told me she had heard the same complaint from some of her other clients that had used it. I really wanted to like this because the first couple of times using it, my hair felt great. It was about the 4th time and beyond that it started leaving the greasy feeling.  I won&#x27;t be finishing the bottle.</li>
            <li> Worst product I have ever used on my hair.  Left it gummy and sticky.  Threw it out!</li>
            <li> Very refreshing fragrance compared to others that I tried. Love it!</li>
            <li> For current Wen users: Love the scent. Much better than the fig.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those considering trying Wen: Less flyaway hair than shampoo but your hair doesn&#x27;t stay clean as long, need to wash twice as often as shampoo. Plus side to that is that is not as damaging as regular shampoo so you can use it everyday.</li>
            <li> This one is my favorite! The smell is great and my hair loves this product.</li>
            <li> Wonderful scent &amp; great product....My hair feels healthy, looks so shiney,  and results amaze me!</li>
            <li> I love Wen conditioning shampoos.  I have tried four different ones and the Spring Orange Blossom is definitely my favorite.</li>
            <li> I actually use this product as a body wash - it does not dry the skin at all like soap or body washes.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is amazing. The smell is the best, I hope it is back soon. Love the smell in my hair, and softness. My favorite of all..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like washing your hair with conditioner instead of shampoo.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any huge difference, but I&#x27;m a senior and really can&#x27;t expect miracles.  The fragrance is VERY LIGHT.  I have a lot of sinus problems, but this doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
            <li> This product is life changing!!!</li>
            <li> LOVE WEN! GREAT PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> My wife loves it and has re-ordered several times.</li>
            <li> This still is the best!  I love, love, love it!  My budget allowed this magnificent product, finally.  It is expensive but it was and is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started co-washing my natural hair several years ago.  I saw the infomerical and wanted to try it again.  It&#x27;s still the same wonderful product.  Use it sparingly if you are on a budget.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair soft but was hoping for more of a lingering orange blossom scent to my hair</li>
            <li> I was very hopeful of this cleansing conditioner.  However, even with extensive rinsing, my hair always felt and looked greasy.</li>
            <li> Have also tried the tea tree cleansing conditioner.  After getting used to only having one product  my hair started&lt;br /&gt;To feel really great.!  Your hair is very manageable and has a really nice sheen.  Get lots of compliments.</li>
            <li> I do like the Wen products. I&#x27;ve used them on and off for a while and really like the results. I would probably be a regular user were it not for the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed getting Wen products on this site are a little hit or miss - some seem to be of a higher quality than others. This one (Orange Blossom) was great though, and one of Wen&#x27;s best smells. It&#x27;s got a great fresh and fruity smell, but not too strong or artificial smelling. Smells more fresh than citrus. Some of the Wen varieties are too thin and don&#x27;t seem to moisturize as well, but this one is nice and thick and hydrating. My faves are Orange Blossom, Spring Gardenia, and the original Sweet Almond Mint.</li>
            <li> Says you have to use a ton - like 45 pumps per shower ... WHAT??</li>
            <li> This cleansing conditioner is fabulous!  I love being able to just do &amp;#34;one step&amp;#34; and have it really work. Alot of 2 in 1 shampoo conditioners leave me with static flyaways, but Wen keeps all static out of my hair.  The Spring Orange Blossom smell is fabulous! Makes me feel like I&#x27;m driving through the orange groves in Arizona! The only 2 negatives are, its a bit pricey... and it might make a person shower a little longer, because the longer its on your hair, the better it is for your hair.  Plus, who wants to rinse that awesome aroma out of their hair!!</li>
            <li> I like Wen products, this one seemed thinner than other Wen Conditioning shampoo.  Smells just like orange blossoms.</li>
            <li> There are lots of reviews are out there that state that their hair started falling out when they started using this product... I honestly thought those people were nuts... but, the first time I used Wen, I went on a date about an hour later. I was shedding so bad- my hair was everywhere- even falling in the food. I thought maybe it was just normal shedding from washing my hair, but for some reason it must not have come out in the shower like normal. I continued to use the product for about a week and a half. My hair was very frizzy and the shedding became worse and worse. I don&#x27;t know what more to say, except I stopped using it and went back to DevaCare, which I love. It works better, is a non-lathering silicone, paraban-free formula, my hair is smooth and never frizzy with Devacare and my hair doesn&#x27;t fall out anymore than the normal shedding I experience when brushing or combing my hair. The only reason I wanted to try Wen was for a different scent, but now I think Wen is overpriced, doesn&#x27;t leave the hair as smooth as similar products... and it really does increase hair shedding dramatically. I was skeptical, but I will not use this product.</li>
            <li> First of all, this does not smell like oranges. I grew up in FL with two orange trees, so I know what orange smells like. This product has a tiny citrus scent, which disappears quickly and leaves my hair smelling like funky chemicals. Second, I have naturally oily hair, and this product made it worse. My hair has never been so greasy and goopy. I wasted $30. I&#x27;m back to using Trader Joe shampoo and conditioner, and for 1/4 of the price I&#x27;m seeing better results.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care if he&#x27;s gay, I love his products...</li>
            <li> this particular one is even better than the six thirteen, I think it slips better and it seemed thicker to me, although the six thirteen smells a little better, this is still pretty nice</li>
            <li> I am a Wen girl and have been using Wen exclusively for over a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my least favorite Wen formulation.  I was hoping to love it, because I really love the scent of orange blossom.  However this smells like cat pee, not orange blossom.  To make matters worse, it leaves my hair much drier than the regular WEn formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Avoid this scent!</li>
            <li> I love WEN but for some reason this one doesn&#x27;t work the same. It seems thinner and leaves my hair much drier than my other WEN ever has.  The scent doesn&#x27;t thrill me either.</li>
            <li> I love it and will reorder</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and works great like the other originsls</li>
            <li> I love the smell of it but I must admit the reaction with this and my hair compared to other Wens was not the same.  My hair just wasn&#x27;t happy with this one.  It did seem to dry it out.  My hair has been happy with Sweet Almond Mint and I&#x27;ve done the Winter Mint but I don&#x27;t know---this one just seemed different.</li>
            <li> I love how Wen makes my hair feel. I will admit though, that I wash my hair first with another favorite shampoo, then put the Wen on and work it in well, leave it on for about 3 or 4 minutes then rinse it out.  I ALWAYS get compliments on my hair since using this.  Now that I can buy it on Amazon and not get trapped into an \\&quot;auto subscription\\&quot;, I will buy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edited to add this issue:&lt;br /&gt;OK, been using this a while...just finishing up my second bottle, and I am beginning to get large bumps on my scalp a lot of the time, kind of like big pimples!  I get them on the sides, top and occasionally on the back of my head.  I have done a lot of reading about this, and apparently a lot of people are experiencing the same thing.  I rinse very well, so that is not the issue.  If this continues, I will have to stop using this product.  I have 1 bottle left, and will try to use it, but just wanted to put this out there as kind of an \\&quot;fyi\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> I have been using Wen for about 7 years.  I especially love the scent of Orange Blossoms.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this! Wonderful summer scent. I will definitely purchase again. I like the variety of these products.</li>
            <li> Love Chaz Dean!!! Don&#x27;t love the price. Very impressed with the price.</li>
            <li> Not one of my favorite scents. So I won&#x27;t be ordering this particular one again. But my hair feels wonderful.</li>
            <li> I have been using WEN for about 3 months now, and I love it.  And this flavor is just amazing!  Even my boyfriend thinks it smells great ^_^</li>
            <li> Very disappointing... my hair is super frizzy and thin since I started using Wen. It looks awful while using this conditioner. My hair is much smoother and fuller by using herbal essence.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. The spring orange blossom fragrance is wonderful. I really should order this by the gallon.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like the fragrance!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a Wen girl for 14 years...this was one of the loveliest scents to date!</li>
            <li> My hair became soft after one use.&lt;br /&gt;And the fragrance lasts for long time.&lt;br /&gt;I like this product.</li>
            <li> I did not like this product at all!  The first time I used the WEN product, my hair came out tangled, limp, and flat.  I have a lot of fine hair and this product just didn&#x27;t deliver.  I returned it today.</li>
            <li> This seasonal fragrance did not disappoint. Nice light scent and leaves my hair in great condition.  I only use WEN!</li>
            <li> my friend loves it her hair seems better and don&#x27;t fall out as much.</li>
            <li> I am now a WEN girl FOREVER!! This scent is a little too flowery for me, but I love how it makes my hair look and feel. I am excited to try other kind of WEN hair care products. Thanks for this wonderful product Chaz Dean!</li>
            <li> It smells awesome and I loved it but it didn&#x27;t leave my hair as silky smooth as some of the other Wen scents</li>
            <li> This scent is like walking thru an orange orchard in the spring!  Love it!</li>
            <li> The performance of this cleansing conditioner is amazing, as usual. The scent is wonderful.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo  ever will not use anything else on my hair</li>
            <li> None of his other products work and this no exception.  My hair never feels clean after use.</li>
            <li> LOVE the fragrance !!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the smell of this!  It doesn&#x27;t really smell like orange blossoms, but it does have a nice floral fragrance that, while strong in the bottle, doesn&#x27;t leave your hair overly perfumey.  Nice and thick, too.  This scent is definitely my favorite by far and on my buy again list!</li>
            <li> love it!!!!  refreshing</li>
            <li> I have very fine thin hair and this is AMAZING! My hair is soft, shiny, bouncy, full, smells great, and feels healthy and clean. If you&#x27;re hair is greasy, you&#x27;re not rinsing well or you&#x27;re using too much as a leave-in conditioner. If your hair is dry, maybe your water is hard, you&#x27;re not using a bit as leave-in conditioner... All the negative reviews are totally opposite of my experience. Everyone&#x27;s nose is different. This smells very close to the smell when driving past orange groves in Florida. I look forward to trying the honey peach and the mango coconut. And no one paid me to type this ;)    UPDATE: I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple weeks now. I used to have quite a bit of hair that came out in the shower and also as I was blow drying my hair. I wasn&#x27;t expecting this and as far as I&#x27;m concerned this, in and of itself, is worth the product: my hair has almost completely stopped falling out! Yes, I get hairs that fall out just like everyone else, but before there were times when I wondered how I wasn&#x27;t bald. Having very thin, fine hair has been difficult because it just looks wispy. I&#x27;m excite to see what happens in the next 6 months!</li>
            <li> I liked the clean scent this product gave my hair.  I recently purchased the comb by Chaz Dean and it is a must for longer hair as you work the product thru your hair.  I would purchase again!</li>
            <li> I normally use the almond mint but wanted to try a different scent - I love the scent of this and the way this conditioner makes my hair feel is just wonderful.</li>
            <li> My daughter uses this kind of hair care.  She doesn&#x27;t want any other brand.  I order it for her. When she is out and has to use something else, she says her hair isn&#x27;t as easy to manage. I ask her when she needs it and order for her.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a WEN girl for almost 5 years and I adore orange blossom scents when done well. This one, however, is not. It&#x27;s not a true orange blossom. It&#x27;s scent is harsh and has a chemical overtone. I agree with others in that the texture of this one is not the same as  some of the original formulations. I&#x27;ll use it but I won&#x27;t be reordering this scent.</li>
            <li> Love Love Love WEN!!!!!  My hair is so Heathly now. The Spring Orange smells like Oranges mixed with  Gardenias. Every time I use thier product I get a lot  of complements  on  how heathly and beautiful  my hair looks and smells. I would recommend  to any buyer try all the seasonal scents. They will make your hair smell and look wonderful.</li>
            <li> This smells wonderful. Been using Wen for about 1 1/2 years and I simply love it. Great seller and they ship very fast. Thanks...</li>
            <li> Scrumptious! I love this fragrance! Wen cleansing conditioner is the only &amp;#34;shampoo&amp;#34; I use on my hair. It&#x27;s the best!</li>
            <li> I love this product and how it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li> What can I say about this? I can say AWESOME! Creamy formula, I no longer need conditioner, shiny, gorgeous hair.  I color treat my 46 year old chestnut brown hair, and this stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li> this new summer scent is perfect. not overwhelming, just soft and subtle. and like the info- mercial says, the longer you leave it on the better.</li>
            <li> I have been using the sweet almond cleansing conditioner for years, I love the scent of the Orange Blossom.  I will probably switch back and forth between the two.</li>
            <li> Marvelous immediately i have noticed the change of my hair.</li>
            <li> Nice scent. I really like the fresh orange blossom scent. Since it mostly a hair conditioning product, my normally fly away hair is more under control. For me, with short hair, two pumps is plenty of product per usage. Is it better than standard shampoo and conditioner? The jury is still out.</li>
            <li> Smells pretty good, but I found that this variety is more drying on my hair and I got itchy scalp and dandruff.  I much prefer the pomegranate version.</li>
            <li> Average product.  Smells nice.  This was the first time I bought a Wen product - not real excited to buy any more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for years</li>
            <li> I alternate this with others but it smells great!</li>
            <li> The 2 WEN products (this one and the one below) are for my oldest granddaughter.  This is one of her favorites.</li>
            <li> The hair looks so healthy, people notice the difference. But I prefer the mint which was my first purchase from Chaz.</li>
            <li> Love the Smell and it works on my curls like a dream</li>
            <li> My hair did not look, smell or feel clean and the fragrance was strange.</li>
            <li> I actually watched in the infomercial yesterday after using the product for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me assure you, I did not have the same &amp;#34;amazing&amp;#34; results after a single use.  In fact, the texture and softness of my hair is the same as ever.  My hair is not thicker.  It is not fuller.  It is not less frizzy.  It did not dry faster.  Just as much hair fell out in the shower.  The only difference I see is that the color of my hair changed a little....lighter in the roots and darker at the ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cleansing conditioner works just as well as the Suave I usually use.  The main difference is that the Wen costs 20X more!</li>
            <li> Got it for my sister as a gift, and she says she absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> I like the scent of the Wen orange blossom and it really keeps my hair soft after&lt;br /&gt;I color it. I only use it for a couple of weeks after I color because of the dryness&lt;br /&gt;After coloring. I use my regular shampoo after that. It takes a couple uses for hair&lt;br /&gt;to soften. I have shoulder length hair and I used 7-8 pumps and comb through hair,&lt;br /&gt;leave on while you shower, then rinse completely and apply 1-2 pumps as a conditioner&lt;br /&gt;then rinse.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very nice the first few times you use it, then it starts to make my hair lifeless and dull. Then I have to use a clarifying shampoo to remove the residue.</li>
            <li> The Wen products are absolutely amazing. At first I didn&#x27;t think so but the more I use them and realized they are &amp;#34;cleansing&amp;#34; conditioner it is amazing. I have had people walk up to me at a store and tell me my hair is beautiful Thanks to Wen.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never found a Wen product I didn&#x27;t like! Try it, you&#x27;ll be more than plzd!</li>
            <li> My hair has never felt so clean or bouncy. It&#x27;s awesome stuff! It&#x27;s pricey, but worth it</li>
            <li> Love the product n the shipping is super fast</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s in this stuff but it works miracles on my frizzy curly hair. Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> Love this scent!  Works fantastic product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this several times, and am still not sure if I like it. My hair never feels clean. And within one day of use, my hair looks greasy. I&#x27;m going to continue to use it, but if my hair still feels greasy, I&#x27;m not going to buy it again.</li>
            <li> so expensive and a lot of different opinion on it. I decided to try it anyway, and love it. My hair is growing back now after chemo and radiation left me bald. As the hair grew back, it looked untamed and very dry.  This shampoo is wonderful, I don&#x27;t have a lot of hair, but what I have now looks and feels great.</li>
            <li> Smells so pretty- usual great performance of a wen product.</li>
            <li> I have thick somewhat frizzy hair. This works well as long as I dont rise it too thoroughly - just mostly rinsed. The smell is intense when smelling the bottle but is more mild when applied to hair. Smells more to me like gardenia/honeysuckle.</li>
            <li> not for my hair, prefer winter vanilla mint</li>
            <li> A very pretty scent and of course great product!</li>
            <li> TOO WIERD SMELLING,TOO STRONG</li>
            <li> My bottle did not have &amp;#34;by chaz dean&amp;#34; written under wen. It did not work like any other &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; wen cleanser i purchased from wen. It left my hair very heavy and unmanageable.</li>
            <li> Not at all what I thought it would be. The second ingredient is alcohol--how can it NOT dry out your hair??  More frizz than I had before!</li>
            <li> Use WEN products.  Not a fan of the almond mint so I try different fragrances when available.</li>
            <li> I tried Wen earlier but I thought it didn&#x27;t think it work for me.  I even gave away (sob!) a whole gallon jug--and boy do I wish I had it back now!!!  I&#x27;m using the orange blossom fragrance and my hair is responding so well.  I self color and had pretty much chemically killed it, I tried Wen again as a last resort before cutting off about 10 inches. It saved my hair and I get compliments every day on how good it looks.    If you try it, Follow The Directions!  It will change your hair forever and you&#x27;ll never let shampoo touch it again.</li>
            <li> my hair loves this stuff</li>
            <li> I always love the seasonal scents by chaz Dean,  but this one is a particular favorite of mine. Wonderfully fragrant without being overowering, rich, thick and makes your hair feel soft and silky.</li>
            <li> I love WEN cleansing conditioner. It was a bit unusual to shampoo my hair without the bubbles but this product works really well for me.  I color my hair and because of this the end are dry. WEN is the only product I have found that has made my hair look and feel soft and not frizzy.</li>
            <li> Product smells nice but left my hair feeling waxy and heavy.</li>
            <li> I love this scent. It works great for me. I&#x27;m very happy with this one.</li>
            <li> Works great for me.  I&#x27;ve read many negative reviews about Wen products.  I learned that it does matter which one you use.  You can&#x27;t purchase by fragrance alone.  Some have left my hair a greasy mess while others have totally changed my hair by adding volume and body.  However, these still aren&#x27;t for everyone.  I do suggest anyone try the formula for their hair type and see how it works.</li>
            <li> I like it! My hair is fine/short so I gave tweaked the use. I alternate wash and leave in conditioner days. My hair is less frizzy and the color less washed out looking. I use much less than the 10 pumps recommended for short hair, which helps negate cost.</li>
            <li> Smells great. Puts me in a great mood.</li>
            <li> Love WEN products but the scent on this one is not to my liking. Very unpleasant.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not what I thought the scent would be.</li>
            <li> Wen is good, but this scent is not my favorite.</li>
            <li> Was not sure at first but after several uses I think I will continue to use this product. I found that about 9 pumps works about right for my shoulder length hair</li>
            <li> One word for this product... AWESOME!!</li>
            <li> I truly like this product!  It is the only hair care treatment that I have used that prevents hair loss. I was having a lot of hair loss with regular shampoos and I was getting to the point where I just dreaded shampooing my hair cause I knew I would loose about 100 strands of hair.  I feared that I&#x27;d be bald soon.  WEN leaves my hair soft, clean and I am not loosing my hair after using this product.  I look forward to using this product regularly.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful just too heavy for my thin hair. Would probably work great for someone with truly dry hair (not dryness from damage).</li>
            <li> I first started using Wen from a trial order deal that was inexpensive and packed with goodies. I was skeptical - it was an infomercial product! I tried really hard to dislike Wen, but it  really does make my hair look and feel great. The part about Wen I dislike was the membership program and how much the product costs after the trial order. Yikes! Getting out of the Mafia is easier than cancelling with Wen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon saved the day, per usual. I checked, saw Wen for sale, read reviews, shopped, found Orange Blossom and had to have it. Two days later it was in my greedy, little hands and I loved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* In reading some of the other comments it seems that some people expect it to smell like the fruit orange; it really smells like the flower that becomes the orange. That blossom smells similar to gardenia or honeysuckle, as several people have mentioned. Good noses, folks!!</li>
            <li> Love it! Like the smell of oranges.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo. So far I love all of the Wen shampoos. My hair feels bouncier and healthier very much healthier.&lt;br /&gt; I would write a whole lot more reviews if we didn&#x27;t have to use 400 characters on every review.</li>
            <li> the product smell wasn&#x27;t appealing to me, and it didn&#x27;t do well on my fine hair.  I prefer the Chaz Dean Cucumber and Aloe which works really well on my hair.  I would suggest small sample packages for persons to try before buying a large bottle, that way they would be able to choose which one they prefer.</li>
            <li> After I asked, the wife said the Wen met her expectations as it has in her past use of the product.&lt;br /&gt;In my narrow perspective, I think it just costs too much for &amp;#34;soap&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Going natural is a challenge for women who have always used chemicals to process their hair, but WEN is the best product to help you transition. My hair feels clean, smells great and I can keep the cleansing conditioner in my hair. It&#x27;s a two-fer! How sweet can that be?</li>
            <li> It might work well, but it smells pretty bad compared to other hair products.  I doubt I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> great products from wen smells good works great try it</li>
            <li> Left my hair feeling limp and oily. No volume, no luminescence, just flat, limp, and heavy like it was full of goop.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair but nearing 40.  Ends are dry and roots are oily.  This product is amazing!  I can go three days without washing.  Feels so healthy and soft!</li>
            <li> Makes my color-treated hair feel silky smooth!</li>
            <li> Loved this product. Did not use as much as recommended. I was use to the lack of soapy shampoo since I had been buying g organic from Trader Joe&#x27;s. I like the way my hair feels and it is easier to style after using Wen. Will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product.  I am very satisfied!</li>
            <li> We have been using this product for about 6 months, nothing better.  We tic.would like to see the price come down some but other than that it is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I love Wen hair products.  After trying every hair product out there--I have finally found The answer!  I only wish Wen had come out years ago.  I have always had very high maintenance hair. This product actually resolves issues with coarse, frizzy, puffy hair.  For years I have kept my hair super long as the weight made my hair flatten somewhat.  Now I am keeping it long because it is actually pretty!  I will always buy Wen from Amazon --not from T.V. ad&#x27;s--that was a big ($$) mistake!!</li>
            <li> I love the scent. I have used WEN for a few years and this is just another of their great products.</li>
            <li> excellent product. pretty scent</li>
            <li> I would recommend the product for anyone to use, it smells wonderful. It is just a little pricey for the amount you receive.</li>
            <li> This does not work for my hair as well as the winter vanilla mint or the cranberry mint. I have no idea why this is. Maybe mint just does something for my hair. The smell is fair.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the product at all. Very thick almost balm like conditioner. Leaves you hair very heavy, tried to give it away but all co - workers who tried it didn&#x27;t like it either. Never wrote a review in my live! Not worth $30 . Wish I never tried it!!</li>
            <li> When I first got this product I was amazed at the smell.  Its fantastic!  After ordering, I read the product reviews and thought &amp;#34;oh boy, that&#x27;s a lot of money to spend to make my hair look dirty&amp;#34;.  It looks and felt like just washing my hair in condition.  Then I googled EXACTLY how to use the product.  Once I did that, I have to say, my hair has never looked or smelled so nice.  I have medium length hair, I am over 50 and I only buy really good product for my hair.  I am a little unhappy with how expensive this product is but I have to say, it might actually be worth the money, once I figured out to use it.  You use at least 3-5 times as much as regular shampoo (according to directions).  I want to give this 5 stars, but deducted a star for the crazy price.</li>
            <li> Seems thinner than the original</li>
            <li> Have only used once. Could see difference and the feel of hair was different.  So far so good</li>
            <li> Works wonderfully like all of the other WEN products.  My family agrees with me that it smells more like honey suckle then orange blossom.</li>
            <li> This is not the same consistency as the one that I got from the website. Yes it&#x27;s way cheaper but at the same time you are not getting the same product as the full priced product from the wen website. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Love the way my hair feels with this!</li>
            <li> I love the smell and the way it makes my hair feel.  I have fine, thin hair and this does not weigh it down.  I definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> I have tried a few of the Wen cleansers and this one is good, but definitely not my favorite scent - the scent is just okay. I really prefer the fig, summer mango coconut, and fall apple spice. Still works the same as those. I love Wen and will continue to use it - they definitely make my curly hair feel softer than regular shampoos and conditioners.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT, SMELLS SO GOOD</li>
            <li> I only use WEN cleansing conditioners and I&#x27;m eager to try this scent.</li>
            <li> Live these products. this smelled really nice</li>
            <li> As advertised. Good stuff.</li>
            <li> Really like it.  Will purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Love this!  My daughter has a lot of thick, beautiful hair but it has tended to be dry, especially at the ends.  Since the first time using this, it has been easy to manage.  Even the gals at the beauty salon were wondering what &#x27;trick&#x27; mom came up with.</li>
            <li> Did not work for my hair! My hair got greasy!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work well for my fine hair unfortunately.</li>
            <li> Great product but the smell is not what I expected.</li>
            <li> I have always loved this product....the first time I used it my sister bought it to the beach I loved it! The reason I never bought it was I don&#x27;t like being tied to a contract type deal and not knowing exactly what the product and shipment will cost....I did that once on a as seen on TV and they added other things to my order and I will not do it again! I seen it on Amazon and ordered it the price is a little more then I can afford but I have it now!</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t use it everytime I was my hair but haven&#x27;t had any problems with this product.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I have used amny different WENS&#x27;s and this is a perfect summer fragrance and works great too!</li>
            <li> The product arrived in great shape, it really was a smooth transaction and price is budget friendly.  Highly recommend if you are a Wen fan.</li>
            <li> Maybe I wasn&#x27;t using it correctly, but my hair would look greasy after using this product. I threw it out and went back to shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> Smells nice, not too strong. Leaves my hair soft.</li>
            <li> My hair smells and looks so pretty.  I love this blend.  I have tried several different Wen cleansing solutions and this one is great.  I can get two days without washing but that&#x27;s it.  Day two though my hair still looks and smell pretty.</li>
            <li> Wife loves this conditioner and was able to get it cheaper here than elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Love the smell.  2 pumps a wash 3-4 times a week.  In between I use my regular sudsy shampoo.  Might be against the Wen rules, but it works for me!</li>
            <li> The first new scent I like as well as the lavender. Works great too!</li>
            <li> Love the Wen spring orange conditioning cleansing it gives my hair.</li>
            <li> Stay way from this procduct !!!! It will make your hair fall out!</li>
            <li> Leave a film on my hair and makes my scalp itch like crazy.</li>
            <li> One of the best scents. Really smells like orange blossoms But not too overpowering.</li>
            <li> I think I will use different kinds from now on but I really liked this</li>
            <li> High quality ingredients. Love the scent and way it makes my hair feel. Had the WEN raised lettering on the bottom of the bottle.</li>
            <li> I have used various fragrance WEN products (Almond, cucumber, lavender, honey, fig) this smells great but does not work like the other WEN products. My hair is not left silky like I have grown used to.</li>
            <li> The service was great--I still can&#x27;t get the product to work--my hair is either too greasy or has no shine and bounce. I can feel where it might be stronger, but my hair just doesn&#x27;t look very good.</li>
            <li> Very awesome product. I have a sensory disorder child and she can&#x27;t hande chemicals. Leaves her hair beautiful and she loves the soft scent. Also..she has to do EKGs and it breaks down and removed the wax from her hair in moments. Helpful secret. This has become integral in our house</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty good if you wash twice like it recommends.  But the price is so high and having to use so much makes me save it for date nights.  :)</li>
            <li> The scent is a bit plastic or non organic smelling. Love the product but not this scent. Way too strong</li>
            <li> Awesome fragrance...makes my hair feel cleaner than anything I&#x27;ve tried in a long time.</li>
            <li> perfect and will order again</li>
            <li> I like the product but use it about a 3rd of the time and not near as much as it says. I use about 4 pumps. If I over use it starts to make my hair oily.</li>
            <li> My first Wen product and I see a big improvement in my hair! It smells great and leaves hair manageable and looking full and healthy. I will definitely be a return customer. My hair dresser sees a difference. He says his customers that use Wen have longer lasting color.</li>
            <li> As advertised, for a change, my hair has never looked or felt better!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a good product at all!</li>
            <li> Has a heavy scent, I use a little at a time, along with my other hair care products to boost their scent.  Used alone it is a bit overpowering, but pleasant.</li>
            <li> So happy to have found this scent again. Subtle but  still orangey.</li>
            <li> Loved the smell. Nice and light spring-y scent. Excellent conditioning properties.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used.  For the first time in many years i do not need any additional product and I have wavy/frizzy hair naturally and use a flat iron most days.  I used to have to use a good amount of hair product to get my hair to behave, Not with Wen, it&#x27;s all i need.  Love it, Buy it</li>
            <li> Use nothing else.  Love it.  Butternut Amazon</li>
