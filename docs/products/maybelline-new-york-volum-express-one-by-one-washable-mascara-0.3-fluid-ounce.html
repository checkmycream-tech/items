            <li>This mascara gives me great coverage.</li>
            <li>It separates each lash and gives great volume, definition and length.</li>
            <li>Its great to put in your bag though.</li>
            <li>I am a mascara junkie, always looking for the latest and greatest.  </li>
            <li>but I really liked it!</li>
            <li>Love it, made my eyelashes look awesome!</li>
            <li>Good stuff...</li>
            <li>I have figured I need to switch to another brand of mascara since the Maybelline product isn&#x27;t as good....</li>
            <li>even the cute bottle!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this mascara!</li>
            <li>I have tried everything (on the cheaper side) and this mascara is by far the best.</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE this mascara!  </li>
            <li>Best mascara, definitely try it!</li>
            <li>Just wouldn&#x27;t be able to swim (or cry) without it running.</li>
            <li>I love everything about it...</li>
            <li>I love wearing mascara</li>
            <li>It never clumps and goes on easily on top and bottom lashes.</li>
            <li>I love the price.  </li>
            <li>, the formula seems to have changed on most of the washable mascaras.  </li>
            <li>Love the brush, which I guess is what makes this one better.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s pretty good for a day time look.</li>
            <li>This is a very good mascara overall.</li>
            <li>It also washes off easily.</li>
            <li>No flaking and removed easily.</li>
            <li>did easily and effortlessly wash away.</li>
            <li>It is just a strong perfumey rosey smell.</li>
            <li>This one is blob free, it goes on beautifully but still gives your lashes a volumizing coat, no extra combing requied.  </li>
            <li>Mascara was nothing fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Cheap looking and doesn&#x27;t look god.</li>
            <li>Have tried every mascara from Great Last to Show</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many other mascaras but this one is the best by far!</li>
            <li>So glad to find some at a reasonable price!</li>
            <li>Goes on clean, separates, no clumps, and wears well.</li>
            <li>You are not going to get big, fat lashes with this, but for a more clean and natural look for daytime (which is what I was looking for), this is great.  </li>
            <li>Whether I go light or heavy, it&#x27;s great,</li>
            <li>It is definitely a natural look, but to be honest, I think Maybelline Colossal is more natural looking than this, even.</li>
            <li>but this is my new favorite.</li>
            <li>and I love to keep trying new ones that come out in the market.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t glob at all and went on smooth and really separated my lashes.</li>
            <li>I think it is important to use a new  product if I begin to feeling itching in my eyes.  </li>
            <li>This mascara does not burn my eyes as some frequently do, and this style brush easily separates the lashes as it is applied.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine for the sensitive skin around my eyes.</li>
            <li>Maybelle  discontinued this item (at least at Walmart), so I was happy to find them on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>wonderful brush; sad because I think it&#x27;s being phased out</li>
            <li>This one gives a nice, clean glide and doesn&#x27;t make my eyelashes look like they were drawn on with a dull crayon.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve worn this mascara for several years, and like it as I don&#x27;t have to use make-up remover to take it off, but it stays on just fine all day.  </li>
            <li>The pink one is hard to find but it&#x27;s the best.</li>
            <li>Most of the volumizing mascaras are wet and blob when you apply them requiring combing to get rid of the blobs.  </li>
            <li>It really does reach all the itty bitty lashes.  </li>
            <li>It separates the lashes really well and makes them appear thicker.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have the feathery look that Colossal has, but it is still natural.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Since then, I have tried pretty much all drugstore brands (Cover Girl, Maybelline, Rimmel, Revlon, Almay, etc) &amp; some department store ones as well (mainly Clinique, for my sensitive skin).  </li>
            <li>and I think I&#x27;ve finally found the right one!  </li>
            <li>The Brownish Black is a great color for me because I have blond hair and black looks to intense.  </li>
            <li>I would love the product if I would have gotten black.</li>
            <li>I did not see this particular type in my usual cosmetics place (CVS drug) and am really glad to have found it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I have been searching for a new mascara since Cover Girl discontinued their Marathon Mascara.  </li>
            <li>That tells me that it may have bacteria in it from use and it is time to get  new one.</li>
            <li>I tried this mascara last month when it first came out</li>
            <li>The packaging was a little beat up but the mascara was fine.</li>
            <li>I learned that I must have sensitive skin because certain mascaras left me with an allergic reaction around my eyes.      </li>
            <li>Instead of regular bristles, it is a harder plastic and as a result, you get really smooth application, not goopy at all, with no lumps or clumping.  </li>
            <li>I love the plastic wand-it&#x27;s different than my usual product</li>
            <li>/&gt;It smells the same as Maybelline Colossal mascara, but as I said in the previous review about the product, it doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li>I really should have read the size of the product, its smaller than I expected it to be.</li>
            <li>All of them would either flake off and leave black powder under my eyes, or irritate my eyes, or just not work very well.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I&#x27;ll stick with Flat to Fab by Hard Candy thanks.</li>
            <li> I love this one and recommend it to anyone looking for a volumizing mascara that doesn&#x27;t blob or look artificial.</li>

            <li> The others are too thick, chunky, or clumpy.</li>
            <li> Not at all thick like the reviews said.</li>
            <li> She says it doesn&#x27;t clump or feel thick or bulky.</li>
            <li> You just have to test both to see what I mean, and you&#x27;ll understand.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is not going to give you any dramatic doll eyed results</li>
            <li> So sorry that Maybelline quit making this.  </li>
            <li> Bad, bad,bad, bad, bad, bad, bad mascara</li>
            <li> hate it.</li>
            <li> Horribly clumpy!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I have tried everything (on the cheaper side) and this mascara is by far the best. I curl my lashes before applying, and then wiggle the brush side to side as I move outward on the lashes. Every time I wear this mascara everyone asks me if i&#x27;m wearing lashes. I always get compliments! Best mascara, definitely try it!</li>
            <li> This is the best mascara. Maybelline makes a bunch of different colored bottles in this series. The pink one is hard to find but it&#x27;s the best. The others are too thick, chunky, or clumpy. This one gives a nice, clean glide and doesn&#x27;t make my eyelashes look like they were drawn on with a dull crayon.</li>
            <li> This mascara gives me great coverage. I&#x27;ve tried other brands but this is my new favorite. Eye care professionals recommend that you change mascara every three months, so I have it on Amazon&#x27;s autoship.</li>
            <li> I like this mascara. It made my lashes look fuller and longer. Very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Maybelle  discontinued this item (at least at Walmart), so I was happy to find them on Amazon.  I&#x27;ve worn this mascara for several years, and like it as I don&#x27;t have to use make-up remover to take it off, but it stays on just fine all day.  Just wouldn&#x27;t be able to swim (or cry) without it running.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a new mascara since Cover Girl discontinued their Marathon Mascara.  I had used that one for over 10 years.  Since then, I have tried pretty much all drugstore brands (Cover Girl, Maybelline, Rimmel, Revlon, Almay, etc) &amp; some department store ones as well (mainly Clinique, for my sensitive skin).  All of them would either flake off and leave black powder under my eyes, or irritate my eyes, or just not work very well.  I learned that I must have sensitive skin because certain mascaras left me with an allergic reaction around my eyes.      I tried this mascara last month when it first came out and I think I&#x27;ve finally found the right one!  This mascara stays on all day.  It holds a curl if you curl your lashes.  It&#x27;s fine for the sensitive skin around my eyes. There&#x27;s a little thing inside this tube that gets excess mascara off the wand so that it doesn&#x27;t glob.  The brush on this mascara is also the perfect size.  I love everything about it... even the cute bottle!</li>
            <li> This brush is really different.  Instead of regular bristles, it is a harder plastic and as a result, you get really smooth application, not goopy at all, with no lumps or clumping.  You are not going to get big, fat lashes with this, but for a more clean and natural look for daytime (which is what I was looking for), this is great.  It also washes off easily.</li>
            <li> Good stuff...I&#x27;m a hero because I found it online for my wife!</li>
            <li> I am a mascara junkie, always looking for the latest and greatest.  I don&#x27;t buy the expensive brands any more  because mascara has a limited shelf life, so I only use drugstore brands.  I am always looking for one that doesn&#x27;t blob but still makes my eyelashes (which are long but light) look thick and  dark.  Most of the volumizing mascaras are wet and blob when you apply them requiring combing to get rid of the blobs.  This one is blob free, it goes on beautifully but still gives your lashes a volumizing coat, no extra combing requied.  It really does reach all the itty bitty lashes.  I love this one and recommend it to anyone looking for a volumizing mascara that doesn&#x27;t blob or look artificial. I use the waterproof version.</li>
            <li> This mascara is great! I love the plastic wand-it&#x27;s different than my usual product but I really liked it! It didn&#x27;t glob at all and went on smooth and really separated my lashes. It made my lashes looked &#x27;curled&#x27; also. No flaking and removed easily. Really happy with this product!</li>
            <li> I love wearing mascara and I love to keep trying new ones that come out in the market. This is a very good mascara overall. It separates the lashes really well and makes them appear thicker. This is not going to give you any dramatic doll eyed results but it&#x27;s pretty good for a day time look. It doesn&#x27;t flake or run onto my eyelids.</li>
            <li> It may not be holy grail status to me but I do like this mascara. My lashes look curled, separated, defined, and somewhat thickened. I can&#x27;t say they&#x27;re thick enough for what I expected or that it lengthened much, but it isn&#x27;t bad. It is definitely a natural look, but to be honest, I think Maybelline Colossal is more natural looking than this, even. It doesn&#x27;t have the feathery look that Colossal has, but it is still natural. You just have to test both to see what I mean, and you&#x27;ll understand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells the same as Maybelline Colossal mascara, but as I said in the previous review about the product, it doesn&#x27;t bother me. It is just a strong perfumey rosey smell. I can deal with it.</li>
            <li> Love it, made my eyelashes look awesome!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this mascara! It separates each lash and gives great volume, definition and length.The Brownish Black is a great color for me because I have blond hair and black looks to intense.  It never clumps and goes on easily on top and bottom lashes. I&#x27;ve tried many other mascaras but this one is the best by far! I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this mascara!  I&#x27;m heartbroken that it&#x27;s been discontinued.</li>
            <li> This mascara does not burn my eyes as some frequently do, and this style brush easily separates the lashes as it is applied.</li>

            <li> Daughter LOVES this mascara.  I love the price.  Win/win! :D</li>
            <li> Smells really strongly of perfume!!!</li>
            <li> So sorry that Maybelline quit making this.  If you like this, find all you can and horde it.</li>
            <li> Mascara was nothing fantastic.  It constantly flaked.  What was left at the end of the day did easily and effortlessly wash away.</li>
            <li> Comes on thin and light. hate it. Cheap looking and doesn&#x27;t look god. Bad, bad,bad, bad, bad, bad, bad mascara</li>
            <li> Have tried every mascara from Great Last to Show and this is my fave. Goes on clean, separates, no clumps, and wears well. Whether I go light or heavy, it&#x27;s great, no clumping and could even get away without using a lash comb if you had to! And can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> wonderful brush; sad because I think it&#x27;s being phased out</li>
            <li> So glad to find some at a reasonable price!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t buy in stores, so this was great!</li>
            <li> I like and use this product all the time.  I think it is important to use a new  product if I begin to feeling itching in my eyes.  That tells me that it may have bacteria in it from use and it is time to get  new one.</li>
            <li> Horribly clumpy! Not at all thick like the reviews said. I&#x27;ll stick with Flat to Fab by Hard Candy thanks.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this mascara. She says it doesn&#x27;t clump or feel thick or bulky. It doesn&#x27;t flake off, and she doesn&#x27;t have problems with lashes sticking together. She says she doesn&#x27;t even feel it on when she wears it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Maybelline mascara since around 1974.  I&#x27;ve tried department store brands, pyramid products, but I keep coming back to Maybelline.&lt;br /&gt;Except recently (2 years? 3 years?), the formula seems to have changed on most of the washable mascaras.  I&#x27;ve tried every brush style.  I have figured I need to switch to another brand of mascara since the Maybelline product isn&#x27;t as good....until finding this one!  Love the brush, which I guess is what makes this one better.  Perhaps the formula is different, also.  I did not see this particular type in my usual cosmetics place (CVS drug) and am really glad to have found it on Amazon.  Will purchase again!</li>
