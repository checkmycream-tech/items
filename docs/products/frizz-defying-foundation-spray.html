            <li>VERY GOOD STUFF.</li>
            <li>The woman that helped me there was great</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy she told me to use this (along with another product --  )</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a great conditioner.</li>
            <li>Excellent :)&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like Static Guard for my hair and smells great!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2 years now and it is perfect for my fine hair.</li>
            <li>And smells good too.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>But nice... pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;The magic it does to my hair is amazing.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best detangle item on market</li>
            <li>I tried this for the first time and  it smells great, just not as lightweight as they claim.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First off the smell is fabulous!</li>
            <li>seems like I use it in the spring and summer more when it is humid.</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>and it works much better, you just have to remember to shake the bottle because the contents settle.</li>
            <li>I get way better results with infusion 23</li>
            <li>Smells nice and does the job right!</li>
            <li>I have used this product for over a year now and have loved it since I first smelled it.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t make it any easier to comb through my hair, nor did it make it any shinier or easy to manage.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been working fine for me.</li>
            <li>I wanted something that I could leaven it and help with keeping my hair smooth.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try it, as I have been using Suave Kid&#x27;s leave-in for years</li>
            <li>Highly recommended it leaves my hair super soft &amp; smooth!!</li>
            <li>Worth trying though:) definitely NOT crunchy after on my hair.</li>
            <li>Unlike the other review, I have to say it has never made my hair feel anything but soft, static free and tangle free.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m ready to go!</li>
            <li>Thank you and price is reasonable also!</li>
            <li>This is one product I absolutely love because it instantly fixes the problem.</li>
            <li>I have knee length hair that is straight.</li>
            <li>and it is easy to tell when my ends get dry.</li>
            <li>For damaged, frizzy or dry hair this is a great product; but otherwise its probably a waste of money.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>My only suggestion is do not use it on your hair unless it&#x27;s been freshly washed and is damp from towel drying.</li>
            <li>Love the smell and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair sticky or stiff.</li>
            <li>left my first bottle in NYC, so I went to Sally&#x27;s and bought another bottle.</li>
            <li>I did try to use it on dry hair once to calm fly-aways</li>
            <li>In the winter, I can hardly control the static in my hair.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m in the clear the rest of the day.</li>
            <li>have natural hair (kinky, curly, coils)</li>
            <li>This product was recommended to me after complaining of damaged, tangled, over-processed hair by a hair care professional.  </li>
            <li>It helps me with detangling and makes it soft and shiny</li>
            <li>ION leave in conditioner works very well in my fine hair and doesn&#x27;t weigh it down like other leave-ins do.</li>
            <li>So far I like it but not totally sold on it since it&#x27;s still a new product for me.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s a whole other story.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I live in a VERY dry state, therefore I need lots of condition.</li>

            <li> Can&#x27;t get a comb thru my wet hair without it.</li>

            <li> and it&#x27;s hard to find something that will help tame</li>

            <li> My hair was looking dull, dry, and ugly without.</li>
            <li> It was like spraying liquid candy onto my hair, icky!</li>

            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this on amazon but in Sally&#x27;s beauty supply store. The woman that helped me there was great but that&#x27;s a whole other story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have natural hair (kinky, curly, coils) and it&#x27;s hard to find something that will help tame it.&lt;br /&gt;OMG I&#x27;m so happy she told me to use this (along with another product --  )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off the smell is fabulous! Not stinky. Not strong. But nice... pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;The magic it does to my hair is amazing. I wash my hair once a week (sometimes longer) so this helps keep it tamed and moisturized during the non washed days. After waking up I give my hair a little spritz, puff it out a little and I&#x27;m ready to go! My hair was looking dull, dry, and ugly without. Now I don&#x27;t know what I would do without it!&lt;br /&gt;It DOES NOT leave my hair crunchy. There is no residue whatsoever. So I don&#x27;t know what the heck some of you have been putting in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I left my first bottle in NYC, so I went to Sally&#x27;s and bought another bottle. :P&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a great conditioner. Smells nice and does the job right!</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me after complaining of damaged, tangled, over-processed hair by a hair care professional.  I was excited to try it, as I have been using Suave Kid&#x27;s leave-in for years to de-tangle my hair (works great, believe it or not!).  I&#x27;m glad I can return this Ion Detangler, because not only does it smell like disgusting sugary candy, it also leaves my hair crunchy and hard!  It didn&#x27;t make it any easier to comb through my hair, nor did it make it any shinier or easy to manage.  If anything, it left my hair feeling in worse condition, and DRYER, than it had before I used this product.  It was like spraying liquid candy onto my hair, icky!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over a year now and have loved it since I first smelled it. I hadn&#x27;t even sprayed it onto my hair yet and the smell alone had me hooked. I do not use it every single day...seems like I use it in the spring and summer more when it is humid. Worth trying though:) definitely NOT crunchy after on my hair. Has always kept it silky.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years, even my husband has started to use it after the shower to add a little to his hair. It helps me with detangling and makes it soft and shiny</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2 years now and it is perfect for my fine hair. Every other leave in I&#x27;ve tried has made my hair greasy looking by mid-day. Unlike the other review, I have to say it has never made my hair feel anything but soft, static free and tangle free. It does have a strawberry scent but it&#x27;s not over powering at all. My only suggestion is do not use it on your hair unless it&#x27;s been freshly washed and is damp from towel drying. I did try to use it on dry hair once to calm fly-aways and it did feel a little funky but definitely not crunchy.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! Love it!</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT. I CAN ACTULLY COMB MY HAIR AFTER WASHING IT. GAVE THIS A 5 STAR RATING. VERY GOOD STUFF.</li>
            <li> Awesome product!! Highly recommended it leaves my hair super soft &amp; smooth!! Love it!</li>
            <li> I tried this for the first time and  it smells great, just not as lightweight as they claim. Left my hair feeling heavy and nasty after I blowdried. I won&#x27;t be using this again, completely disappointed.</li>
            <li> Sprays like a silly string, more like a gloss or cream than leave in conditioner. Doesn&#x27;t spray evenly so it doesn&#x27;t distribute evenly through hair. Next to impossible to pump spray and often squirts to one side (away from hair). Miserable experience. I&#x27;ll never purchase again. I use Argan Oil leave in hair spray now and it works much better, you just have to remember to shake the bottle because the contents settle.</li>
            <li> The best de tangled!  And smells good too.</li>
            <li> I bought this from Sally Hansen and not from Amazon, but it works so well that I needed to review it.&lt;br /&gt;I have very thick, naturally straight hair and it is easy to tell when my ends get dry. I hate when a product weighs down my hair or makes it greasy. I&#x27;ve tried serums on my ends and other leave-in-conditioners but they were too thick and oily for me to regularly use.&lt;br /&gt;This product on the other handâ€¦.&lt;br /&gt;It instantly revives and smoothens my dry ends, smells slightly fruity (but for me the smell dissipates within a few minutes), and literally feels lighter than water when I mist it on. It&#x27;s like vitamins for your hair! Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> ION leave in conditioner works very well in my fine hair and doesn&#x27;t weigh it down like other leave-ins do.</li>
            <li> I have been using for a couple of months and I recently cut my hair in a short pixy style.  It&#x27;s been working fine for me.</li>
            <li> I have knee length hair that is straight. It can be a bugger trying to de tangle it after washing and I wash often because I work out.I wanted something that I could leaven it and help with keeping my hair smooth. So far I like it but not totally sold on it since it&#x27;s still a new product for me. Love the smell and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair sticky or stiff.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best detangle item on market and I use to use another brand for years!  Thank you and price is reasonable also!</li>
            <li> My 3a/3b hair doesn&#x27;t benefit from this product at all. It&#x27;s like spraying perfumed water, unless I use 1/4 of the bottle. Very disappointing. I get way better results with infusion 23</li>
            <li> By now, I think I&#x27;ve tried almost every hair product that&#x27;s out there. To me this did nothing for my hair, however, my friend who is a hairdresser came to my house to give me a blow out and told me that she loves whatever I put in my hair and asked me what it was so she can use it on her clients so there ya go.</li>
            <li> I personally like-like this product. I live in a VERY dry state, therefore I need lots of condition. When Im at home and I dont use this, my hair is dry/looks damaged. When Im out of town, I dont even need this. For damaged, frizzy or dry hair this is a great product; but otherwise its probably a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t get a comb thru my wet hair without it.</li>
            <li> Excellent :)&lt;br /&gt; (use as a de-tangler for long hair )</li>
            <li> In the winter, I can hardly control the static in my hair. It sticks to EVERYTHING.  This is one product I absolutely love because it instantly fixes the problem. I typically only have to spray it on in the mornings onto dry hair and I&#x27;m in the clear the rest of the day. It&#x27;s like Static Guard for my hair and smells great!</li>
