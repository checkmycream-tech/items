            <li>I would definitely recommend this beautiful Barrette to all</li>
            <li>Works just fine.</li>
            <li>It does appear to be primarily glued though.</li>
            <li>Beautiful and worth the money spent.</li>
            <li>But they ARE very pretty.</li>
            <li>Very pretty and  festive.  </li>

            <li>Pretty shiny crystals!</li>
            <li>Great for the holidays or just everyday.  </li>
            <li>This is a really versatile hair clip, just the right size for most hairstyles, and it holds, opens and closes really well.</li>
            <li>It is however far more pretty in person and can be used as a decoration.</li>
            <li>very well made and very pretty.</li>
            <li>Pretty hair clip.</li>
            <li>I really like it!</li>
            <li>and  they look pretty</li>
            <li>Pretty and sturdy.  </li>
            <li>Great clip, holds my thick hair quite well.  </li>
            <li>Pretty, not gaudy,  classy look and goes with more dressier stuff but will go with casual with nice top.</li>
            <li>Beautiful color, light weight but holds my long thick hair up well.</li>
            <li>A little big so best worn on back of head.  </li>
            <li>I guess that means it is a real winner</li>
            <li>Shipped fast and packaged well.</li>
            <li>Much prettier than the picture.</li>
            <li>It holds my long hair quite securely.</li>
            <li>I have bought several of these hair clips and they are inexpensive and very pretty.  </li>
            <li>it has a firm and strong clasp.</li>
            <li>Again I was worried it would not be large enough for my hair.</li>
            <li>one of the clear crystals was put in and lays on its side.</li>
            <li>Had not been aware that it was coming from Hong Kong and would take so long.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of hair and it slipped a lot, didn&#x27;t really have a tight grip</li>
            <li>if you have fine thin hair this is probably not the one for you.</li>

            <li> I didn&#x27;t  like it at all.</li>
            <li> My mom loves the color of this barrette and is now shopping for something to wear it with. I guess that means it is a real winner</li>

            <li> Again I was worried it would not be large enough for my hair. But this time I was pleasantly please. They are beautiful and have nice weight to them. What else to say about them. Other then they work.</li>
            <li> This clip is so gorgeous!  The photo doesn&#x27;t do it justice.  I love it and hope to get more for gifts.  A++++</li>
            <li> Very nice barrett.  Ships from Asia, so be patient.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 of these and 1 broke already. But they ARE very pretty.</li>
            <li> Far more beautiful in person is this barrette. It is a medium sized barrette. It can not hold a lot of hair if you were purchasing this to the nape of your neck to hold back all your hair (it will not work). It is however far more pretty in person and can be used as a decoration. I took off a star because I am not certain how long it will last. it doesn&#x27;t seem badly constructed though. It does appear to be primarily glued though. If it holds up for a long time, then I will edit my review.</li>

            <li> Beautiful and worth the money spent.</li>
            <li> very well made and very pretty. i cannot give it 5 stars. one of the clear crystals was put in and lays on its side. it has a firm and strong clasp. it will hold a good amount of hair. it is heavy. if you have fine thin hair this is probably not the one for you. it falls out of my hair and its thick and coarse</li>
