    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>But since I am not, I tolerate this 20% wonderfully.</li>
            <li>I love this product!!!!  </li>
            <li>Really happy I purchased this product!!</li>
            <li>Salicylic Acid is excellent for acne or even to prevent breakouts!</li>
            <li>I can now say it&#x27;s wonderful!</li>
            <li>The product works great.</li>
            <li>It does need to be used with great caution, and read the directions thoroughly.</li>
            <li>Great for acne, oily prone skin.</li>
            <li>otherwise use this every week, but havent really experienced ANY peeling.</li>
            <li>Amazing stuff!</li>
            <li>My face looks really good.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a good product that I&#x27;ll continue to use.</li>
            <li>Love the way it helps my skin, it exfoliates well, and keeps the pimples away.</li>
            <li>Easy as pie?</li>
            <li>Easy as cake?</li>
            <li>Have a strong fan nearby and an ice pack ( the ones you place in a lunch box)</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Your skin will peel, and the new skin underneath will be glowing, lovely, free of congestion.</li>
            <li>This peel is quite strong if you&#x27;re a first time user.  </li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>Luckily I had a bottle of neutralizer for this.  </li>
            <li>Consistent use gives better results and really makes my face/skin glow almost immediately after use.</li>
            <li>I have been using Paula&#x27;s Choice 2% liquid with much success in clearing my clogs, but my skin still looks like it could use a booster.</li>
            <li>I read a scientific journal that found success using salicylic acid biweekly</li>
            <li>I hope I have continued success with this product.</li>
            <li>for 20%, it&#x27;s not nearly as strong as I thought, nor does it do a great job.</li>
            <li>The burn is more gradual with a warm sensation for me, where glycolic is just plan raw skin type of burn.</li>
            <li>It is very gentle and efficient.</li>
            <li>The only ASDM peel product I didn&#x27;t LOVE.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m &amp;#34;naomi campbell&amp;#34; complexion and this certainly helps with pimples and discoloration.</li>
            <li>I use with Aveeno cleanser, mixed with fine grain aluminum oxide crystals for exfoliation, followed by Hyaluronic acid for moisture and Up &amp; Up daily moisturizer with salicylic acid (available at Target for about $4.00) and suscreen.</li>
            <li>It has a slimy feel, and didn&#x27;t seem to do much.</li>
            <li>I used crushed-up, uncoated cheap aspirin instead, which is the same thing.</li>
            <li>thanks for the product.&lt;br /&gt;all satisfied:&lt;br /&gt;price, quality, speed of delivery.</li>
            <li>Works very well.  </li>
            <li>Really cleared my skin up my skin.</li>
            <li>So I purchased this product in hopes that if I add a few drops together of both PC 2% and BH 20% I would have a nice 11% salicylic acid toner.</li>
            <li>The higher percetage makes it a little more drying to the skin, but after 1 day (two uses)</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this as a weekly treatment straight (if you are not allergic to Salicylic acid or Aspirin).</li>
            <li>I only had minor peeling and the burning sensation was more like intense itching.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>, otherwise you taking a chance of not being able to go outside for a very very long time.</li>
            <li>I would start out with the 10% if you are NEW to acids.</li>
            <li>We are now on our second bottle, use it roughly once of month, and are completely satisfied.</li>
            <li>I have done this twice so far:</li>
            <li>i have not had dramatic results, but it didn&#x27;t burn my skin, or leave any kind of marks, and it did leave my skin softer.  </li>
            <li>I leave it on for about 15 mins usually, I make sure not to exfoliate or agitate my skin prior to a treatment, I use it 2-3</li>
            <li>I used to have small bumps like whiteheads and within 3 days a noticed a huge difference.</li>
            <li>I left the peel on for 5 minutes prior to washing it off with a gentle cleanser.</li>
            <li>my  general confidence!</li>
            <li>Must have the major skin burn…</li>
            <li>no other ones do that to me</li>
            <li>Is particularly, impressively, remarkably effective at getting to under-the-skin infections that would otherwise throb and take a week to surface then take a week to go away, they&#x27;re dead overnight, then a couple days later you just peel off a few flakes of skin.</li>
            <li>I have an incredibly thick beard, with incredibly thick hair; I used to shave twice per day, before work, and before going out at night, but it seemed my whole life was dominated by ingrown hairs that would become infected and swollen, stubborn sons-of-a-gun that seemed to only intensify and multiply without ever getting better</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I have been using Paula&#x27;s Choice 2% liquid with much success in clearing my clogs, but my skin still looks like it could use a booster. So I purchased this product in hopes that if I add a few drops together of both PC 2% and BH 20% I would have a nice 11% salicylic acid toner. The higher percetage makes it a little more drying to the skin, but after 1 day (two uses) I&#x27;ve seen my stubborn clogs melt away. I highly recommend this as a weekly treatment straight (if you are not allergic to Salicylic acid or Aspirin). I would start out with the 10% if you are NEW to acids. But since I am not, I tolerate this 20% wonderfully. THANK YOU ASDM Beverly hills for making an effect AFFORDABLE skin care product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your experience may different depending on your skin type and your skin type needs and your level of exposure to peels or acids.</li>
            <li> I love this product!!!!  I have unsightly acne scars - some deep, some shallow.  I use this acid peel to soften their look.  It  has worked wonders&lt;br /&gt;for my  general confidence!</li>
            <li> for 20%, it&#x27;s not nearly as strong as I thought, nor does it do a great job.</li>
            <li> The product works great. I had the hesitations about the instructions…. “Leave it on your face and just put a cream on”? I would like to see that face in an hour after that. Must have the major skin burn…Neutralization with water mixed with baking soda is a must, otherwise you taking a chance of not being able to go outside for a very very long time.</li>
            <li> The only ASDM peel product I didn&#x27;t LOVE. It has a slimy feel, and didn&#x27;t seem to do much. I used crushed-up, uncoated cheap aspirin instead, which is the same thing.</li>
            <li> thanks for the product.&lt;br /&gt;all satisfied:&lt;br /&gt;price, quality, speed of delivery.</li>
            <li> Works very well.  Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> did not do anything to my skin</li>
            <li> Subtle, but still does produce changes.</li>
            <li> Really cleared my skin up my skin. I used to have small bumps like whiteheads and within 3 days a noticed a huge difference. Really happy I purchased this product!! I use this product once a day before bed.</li>
            <li> i have not had dramatic results, but it didn&#x27;t burn my skin, or leave any kind of marks, and it did leave my skin softer.  it has not removed dark spots the way i had hoped.</li>
            <li> Shaving has always been the bane of my existence. I have an incredibly thick beard, with incredibly thick hair; I used to shave twice per day, before work, and before going out at night, but it seemed my whole life was dominated by ingrown hairs that would become infected and swollen, stubborn sons-of-a-gun that seemed to only intensify and multiply without ever getting better no matter what I did. I went on two different types of antibiotics for a few months each, used 10% peroxide at night and 5% in the morning for a couple years, used washes of Salicylic and Glycolic and Lactic and Mandelic, but nothing ever worked well enough or long enough. So I bought this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shave using a foaming 10% peroxide wash at night, rinse off, towel off, and use a salicylic toner before bed. When I wake up, I use a glycolic salicylic wash, rinse off, towel off, and then apply this with a qtip on any red/itchy bump. It literally kills blemishes in their tracks before they develop, and what was a couple dozen spots the morning after shaving two weeks ago are now only a couple spots this morning after shaving!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just use a q-tip, dip it in the liquid, poke blemishes a couple of times, throw the q-tip away, wash your hands, it will burn a little for a minute, it will tickle a little for a minute, and that&#x27;s it. I let it sit all day without rinsing. Stay out of the sun. Use a non-greasy moisturizer. A couple days later skin will flake off where the blemishes would have been. Is particularly, impressively, remarkably effective at getting to under-the-skin infections that would otherwise throb and take a week to surface then take a week to go away, they&#x27;re dead overnight, then a couple days later you just peel off a few flakes of skin. Easy as pie? Easy as cake? Whatever, this stuff is a Godsend!</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff! works wonders!!!  I will definitely be a returning customer.</li>
            <li> I thought I would have to leave this on for a couple minutes and then rinse, but the directions state to leave it on overnight (since it neturalizes itself). I have done this twice so far: Once a week along with Glycolic Acid %50 and Latic Acid %40 chemical peels. My face looks really good. I only had minor peeling and the burning sensation was more like intense itching. I would recommended this! Salicylic Acid is excellent for acne or even to prevent breakouts!</li>
            <li> I waited several months before fully evaluating this product. I can now say it&#x27;s wonderful! I use it for myself as well as my teens with acne. It does need to be used with great caution, and read the directions thoroughly. The first time it is used, just do a small area such as the chin or half of your forehead. Have a strong fan nearby and an ice pack ( the ones you place in a lunch box) in the event you cannot tolerate the burning sensation. We found that after several applications, the sensation is just a warmth, not a burn, and your skin becomes accustomed to the salycylic acid. Your skin will peel, and the new skin underneath will be glowing, lovely, free of congestion. Saves a ton of money that you would otherwise spend at the aesthetician. As you use the product, it also becomes slightly weaker. We are now on our second bottle, use it roughly once of month, and are completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> I am giving this a 3 star because I still have to mess with it. I have a few Acid Peels that never bother me. but both times I have tried to use this it BROKE ME OUT... what in the world.. no other ones do that to me so I am scared to keep using it.. I will stick with my Gloc &amp; TCA peels &#x3D;/</li>
            <li> So far so good. I have only used this salicylic acid peel once but I can already see a difference in my skin. It has dried up existing acne and has helped fade hyperpigmentation. I read a scientific journal that found success using salicylic acid biweekly so that is what I will do to replicate their findings. I left the peel on for 5 minutes prior to washing it off with a gentle cleanser. The instructions say that you can let the product neutralize itself but I find the stinging sensation uncomfortable so I opt to wash it off. I hope I have continued success with this product. I will try and post an update in several weeks!</li>
            <li> Love the way it helps my skin, it exfoliates well, and keeps the pimples away. I&#x27;m &amp;#34;naomi campbell&amp;#34; complexion and this certainly helps with pimples and discoloration. I leave it on for about 15 mins usually, I make sure not to exfoliate or agitate my skin prior to a treatment, I use it 2-3 times week, all over my face and under my chin and sometimes if I&#x27;m in a hurry I &amp;#34;spot treat&amp;#34;. Consistent use gives better results and really makes my face/skin glow almost immediately after use.</li>
            <li> This peel is quite strong if you&#x27;re a first time user.  It says on the box that it self neutralizes after 5 minutes, but it didn&#x27;t for me.  Luckily I had a bottle of neutralizer for this.  Overall it&#x27;s a good product that I&#x27;ll continue to use.</li>
            <li> I like it. It is very gentle and efficient.</li>
            <li> Great for acne, oily prone skin. Kills bacteria on skin surface. I use with Aveeno cleanser, mixed with fine grain aluminum oxide crystals for exfoliation, followed by Hyaluronic acid for moisture and Up &amp; Up daily moisturizer with salicylic acid (available at Target for about $4.00) and suscreen. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> So far so good. This burns differently than glycolic  ( i have both from the same seller). The burn is more gradual with a warm sensation for me, where glycolic is just plan raw skin type of burn. I use this to spot treat pimples too - just leave for a minute or two and wash off when spot treating.  Helps dry the zits on the spot. otherwise use this every week, but havent really experienced ANY peeling. I feel the skin get tight and dry, but no peeling.. I ill continue using, maybe it will still help without the drastic results.</li>
