    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This is an excellent moisturizer.</li>
            <li>have suggested to my best friend to use.</li>
            <li>Awesome.  </li>
            <li>The product was in very good condition.  </li>
            <li>I have been using La Prairie products for about 23 years and it works great on my skin-type.</li>
            <li>Somehow is good but kinda oily when compare with Night Repair cream that I always use.</li>
            <li>i have used many brands before including LaMer, Sisley and Shiseido and even though they are all good this one has become my favorite!</li>
            <li>Very nice light cream that really shows good results.  </li>
            <li>If you are interested in this line of products, I suggest getting samples before purchasing (most stores that carry La Prairie are great about giving samples.)</li>
            <li>Have bought from you many times before.  </li>
            <li>Of course I love love love this product.</li>
            <li>I bought this Time Release Moisture Intensive cream because I think it might be even better.</li>
            <li>Now I started buying it again and have fallen in love with it once again.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll be pleased, I promise.</li>
            <li>I never spend this much on a skin care cream, butI have to say that I really love it!!</li>
            <li>It has a good light fragrance, absorbs quickly and can make all the difference in how I approach my day.</li>
            <li>but birthday and holiday presents are easy picks for my family.</li>
            <li>Creamy, rich, non-greasy.</li>
            <li>(You look different today - your skin looks gorgeous.)</li>
            <li>this cream is the best; however it must be used sparingly unless you are wealthy as it is expensive.</li>
            <li>Compare to the other product of &amp;#34;La Prairie Cellular Night Repair Cream, 1.7-Ounce Box&amp;#34; is more better for me.</li>
            <li>When I resumed, I noticed improvement right away</li>
            <li>I have been using this for a week now, and my skin is so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>After 5 days using this product they totally dissapeared and my skin has a healthy glow...</li>
            <li>but, always go back as it is the best for extra dry skin.  </li>
            <li>and you can see if the results are worth the price; remember I am 73 years old.</li>
            <li>Really really see a difference</li>
            <li>and i have very normal skin...</li>
            <li>Due to the price I have tried many others over the years</li>
            <li>I have used this product for past year &amp; love it.</li>
            <li>It is well worth the price but as a senior of a limited income it is an item that is a spurge for me.</li>
            <li>I usually don&#x27;t spend this much on skin cream, but I feel really special using it.  </li>
            <li>I like this one for my extra dry skin better than the ones that are more expensive by La Prairie</li>
            <li>however i am starting to see very fine wrinkles on my forehead lately.</li>
            <li>Kind of expensive</li>

            <li> The product was in very good condition.  Have bought from you many times before.  Will buy from you again</li>
            <li> this cream is the best; however it must be used sparingly unless you are wealthy as it is expensive. It is well worth the price but as a senior of a limited income it is an item that is a spurge for me. I used to buy it when I was working but now it is a stretch.. I will try to add a photo and you can see if the results are worth the price; remember I am 73 years old.</li>
            <li> This cream has become part of my daily ritual.  It has a good light fragrance, absorbs quickly and can make all the difference in how I approach my day.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t spend this much on skin cream, but I feel really special using it.  I&#x27;m 72 and my skin is really soft - even after living in Florida half the year and being in the sun a lot.</li>
            <li> Of course I love love love this product. Creamy, rich, non-greasy. I have been using La Prairie products for about 23 years and it works great on my skin-type. The times I have had to stop using La Prairie because of the cost, my skin got ashy and dull.

I know the line is very expensive - but birthday and holiday presents are easy picks for my family. If you are interested in this line of products, I suggest getting samples before purchasing (most stores that carry La Prairie are great about giving samples.) It is pricey enough that you should try before making a purchase.</li>
            <li> Compare to the other product of &amp;#34;La Prairie Cellular Night Repair Cream, 1.7-Ounce Box&amp;#34; is more better for me. I bought this Time Release Moisture Intensive cream because I think it might be even better. Somehow is good but kinda oily when compare with Night Repair cream that I always use.</li>

            <li> I can’t say enough about this product. I used it many years ago and then stopped because it got too expensive. Now I started buying it again and have fallen in love with it once again. After using it for 3-4 weeks, people comment on how radiant my skin looks. I swear this is the fountain of youth in a bottle.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent moisturizer. If you have dry skin, as I do, use it after applying La Prairie Serum Cellulare Hydrantat. You&#x27;ll be pleased, I promise.</li>

            <li> I never spend this much on a skin care cream, butI have to say that I really love it!! I have been using this for a week now, and my skin is so soft and smooth. The little lines by my eyes are gone!! Give it a try!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for past year &amp; love it.</li>
            <li> I am mid 30s and i have very normal skin...however i am starting to see very fine wrinkles on my forehead lately. After 5 days using this product they totally dissapeared and my skin has a healthy glow...i have used many brands before including LaMer, Sisley and Shiseido and even though they are all good this one has become my favorite! Totally recommend!</li>
            <li> Awesome.  Really really see a difference</li>
            <li> Very nice light cream that really shows good results.  Kind of expensive but if you can afford it, I would recommend it.</li>
