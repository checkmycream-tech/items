    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Great leave-in conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Giovanni is a great brand</li>
            <li>Smells great.</li>
            <li>That alone makes it great for me.</li>
            <li>AMAZING!</li>
            <li>So, I tried some samples of the Giovanni 2CHIC line and totally loved them.</li>
            <li>It adds shine, moisture, strength, and it smells so good.</li>
            <li>and I am very happy with how my very curly hair looks and feels after using this product!</li>
            <li>This is a great leave-in conditioner as it also acts as a light styling product, so you wont get too frizzy.</li>
            <li>perfect for natural curls</li>
            <li>So far I am impressed with this product.  </li>
            <li>I have natural, protein-sensitive hair and this is leave in conditioner is awesome though I do wish it did not contain any water insoluble silicones.</li>
            <li>Most stylists throw argan oil or the like in my hair, and it doesn&#x27;t absorb, just makes it greasy.  </li>
            <li>and my hair is in much better condition because of it.</li>
            <li>I love the Giovanni Hair care products</li>
            <li>but I think this is my favorite one</li>
            <li>(I do nothing more.)</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>It seems to work well on my hair, which is color treated, leaving it much more manageable and softer looking.</li>
            <li>This inexpensive bottle is magic for my hair.</li>
            <li>Hair stylists tell me that my hair is so healthy.</li>
            <li>This product is altogether unique!  </li>
            <li>She has more fine hair and it helped with any tangles but gives no shine and doesn&#x27;t help with frizz.</li>
            <li>Hands down the BEST a product I have ever used on my hair.</li>
            <li>I enjoy that the conditioner and gel is in one product.</li>
            <li>I use this as directed, the moment it touches my hair, it makes it so smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>I liked the sample, but this not so much.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product from Amazon, because I&#x27;d been wanting to try a good natural leave-in conditioner for quite a while.</li>
            <li>I received a free sample from so I bought the full size product here.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair shiny and SUPER smooth without any grease.</li>
            <li>It does not smell as nice and is of a different consistency.</li>
            <li>Overall, I love Giovanni</li>
            <li>I hoped that the fly away dryness could be tamed, although this is a slight improvement from  the usual rinse out kind there is lot&#x27;s of room  to cover to get to  moistureized and shiney.</li>
            <li>Easy enough.</li>
            <li>Love the cream--I use it on my wet, curly hair as a styling agent.</li>
            <li>If you have curly hair and don&#x27;t like a ton of chemicals in your products, I high suggest this product.</li>
            <li>this is just the way this product is, and it might work great for some hair types, but, even after sitting on my shelf for a few months the product still smells oddly of cigarette smoke.</li>
            <li>This leave-in conditioner doesn&#x27;t weigh down my fine hair.</li>
            <li>I think the product I received was either very old or a dupe.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel soft and it gives it a lot of slip.</li>
            <li>It makes it easier to comb through and helps protect her hair and keeps it feeling soft and being shiny for 3-5 days after it&#x27;s use.</li>
            <li>I just shampoo, towel dry, smooth this conditioner through my hair, then blow dry.</li>

            <li> Great leave-in conditioner.  Leaves my hair quite manageable.</li>
            <li> I have color-treated, thick &amp; very curly hair.  Most stylists throw argan oil or the like in my hair, and it doesn&#x27;t absorb, just makes it greasy.  This product is altogether unique!  It absorbs while adding an abundance of shine.  If applied to dry hair, it refreshes the curl, adding definition AND shine.  If used on damp hair, it protects hair from heat styling and has UV filter.  I would totally recommend this product and plan to buy it again and again, as long as Giovanni carries it!</li>
            <li> Giovanni is a great brand and I am very happy with how my very curly hair looks and feels after using this product!</li>
            <li> This is a great leave-in conditioner as it also acts as a light styling product, so you wont get too frizzy. Smells great.</li>
            <li> Since I am using this Conditioner, my hair is not longer falling. I just recommend you to use it! Do it!</li>
            <li> perfect for natural curls</li>
            <li> Hands down the BEST a product I have ever used on my hair. I have thick, curly, frizzy hair and I put a little of this on after its towel dried.  It makes my hair shiny and SUPER smooth without any grease. AMAZING!</li>
            <li> If you have curly hair and don&#x27;t like a ton of chemicals in your products, I high suggest this product. I&#x27;ve used it for over a year now and my hair is in much better condition because of it.</li>
            <li> Used this on my 4 year olds african american hair. She has more fine hair and it helped with any tangles but gives no shine and doesn&#x27;t help with frizz. Don&#x27;t think I would purchase for her again.</li>
            <li> I enjoy that the conditioner and gel is in one product.</li>
            <li> I use this as directed, the moment it touches my hair, it makes it so smooth and silky. I love the Giovanni Hair care products but I think this is my favorite one, it is so moisturizing.</li>
            <li> So, I tried some samples of the Giovanni 2CHIC line and totally loved them.

            <li> Love the cream--I use it on my wet, curly hair as a styling agent. (I do nothing more.) HATEHATEHATE the pump--a fourth of it is always left at the bottom of the bottle because the pump is short.</li>
            <li> I just found the product okay.</li>
            <li> So far I am impressed with this product.  It seems to work well on my hair, which is color treated, leaving it much more manageable and softer looking.</li>
            <li> This leave-in conditioner doesn&#x27;t weigh down my fine hair. That alone makes it great for me. I just shampoo, towel dry, smooth this conditioner through my hair, then blow dry. Easy enough.</li>

            <li> Feels a bit heavy, as my hair feels a bit weighed down.  Hope it protects from heat as it claims.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample from so I bought the full size product here. It does not smell as nice and is of a different consistency. I liked the sample, but this not so much.</li>
            <li> On the advise of my hairdresser I bought a Leave-in-conditioner. I hoped that the fly away dryness could be tamed, although this is a slight improvement from  the usual rinse out kind there is lot&#x27;s of room  to cover to get to  moistureized and shiney.</li>
            <li> My daughter has very dry and course hair.  Even with washing and conditioning it still feels icky.  I was using another product, but then found this one.  We still shampoo and condition.  Then we put this in her hair.  It makes it easier to comb through and helps protect her hair and keeps it feeling soft and being shiny for 3-5 days after it&#x27;s use.</li>
