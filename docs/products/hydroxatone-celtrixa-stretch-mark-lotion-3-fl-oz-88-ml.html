            <li>It is amazing!!</li>
            <li>You will be happy</li>
            <li>I bought this item because of the great reviews but it didn&#x27;t work for me</li>
            <li>Great product,non greasy,and marks are fading already.</li>
            <li>The up side it smelled good.</li>
            <li>Best way to use it is after showering on clean scrubbed skin.</li>
            <li>i love the results!</li>
            <li>You have to use a whole tube before you can see a good improvement!</li>
            <li>Great product, highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>I have used inexpensive lotions that are better than Celtrixa.</li>
            <li>I hope that too many people were not fooled by the commercials on the radio for this product.</li>
            <li>, it smells better, it&#x27;s cheaper and it works a lot better.</li>
            <li>love this helps with stretch marks</li>
            <li>Glad I kept all mi info from two years ago.</li>
            <li>Called the number 888-870-8802 many times and have gotten nothing.</li>
            <li>I am also going to my bank to try to block any more withdrawls from these pigs.</li>
            <li>I was not about to pay any more than I had too.</li>
            <li>Nevertheless, I am purchasing two more bottles.</li>
            <li>so hopefully they will get better results than I did.</li>
            <li>Will be ordering more very very soon!!</li>
            <li>Sure, it made my tummy soft and was a good moisturizer, but if that&#x27;s what you want you&#x27;re way better off buying Aveeno.</li>
            <li>If its made this much of a difference in 7 weeks, I wonder what it will be like in 7 more weeks!</li>
            <li>and you kind of have to use alot since it rubs in fast.</li>
            <li>Worth the money for sure.</li>
            <li>I bought it for the full price twice and went through both tubes and after that they are almost all the way gone.</li>
            <li>But it has been two years, and though I am glad the suit is going through I will not see as much money compared to what they took from me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>But despite the negative reviews celtrixia was perfect for me.</li>
            <li>I am now pregnant and will use this product as a preventative...</li>
            <li>The product was nicely package, and it was the real prodcut, but i have been using for 3 months now 2 times a day, i have not noticed a whole lot of a difference.</li>
            <li>I purchased Anew Stretch Mark smoother from Avon recently and absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>or I should say HAD darks stretch marks thanks to this product they are gone!!</li>
            <li>but this cream is not close to bringing you any satisfaction besides its texture smooth &amp; fast absorbent</li>
            <li>Thanks for a smooth transaction.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>For my skin it was a %100 success.</li>
            <li>but I bought this for my daughters too and theirs are fresh</li>
            <li>I use it if mine look visible and usually right after the shower.</li>
            <li>I purchased two bottle of celtrixa right after having my first child.</li>
            <li>, maybe if i had used a few more bottles it would have been better.</li>
            <li>I noticed the stretch cream work very fast on my stretch marks.</li>
            <li>The Celtrixa Cream really does work!</li>
            <li>It takes more than 2 weeks for the product to work, this bottle lasted me a month &amp; in that time my stretch marks began to appear lighter and smaller, give it time!</li>
            <li>The stretch marks on my stomach began fading after only a couple weeks and now look way better.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t work what so ever not even on throat fresh new stretch marks</li>
            <li>so they can Id it, and stated if returned by a certain date</li>
            <li>With the \\&quot;free trial\\&quot; and the special they had I got two bottles for the average price of 1.</li>
            <li>I tried Celtrixa after I saw a commercial for a 30 day free trial.</li>
            <li>so I can be summer ready</li>
            <li>I really didnt see much of a difference maybe alittle bit lighter.</li>
            <li>I give this product only 4 stars because it did not rid me of my light stretch marks...</li>
            <li>I used it for a month straight</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li>Was not the real product</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure if it has to do with different skin types, but my stretch marks on that area have completely disappeared and are no longer visible.</li>
            <li>After 2 weeks of applying this cream morning and night I can honestly say I see very little change in the stretch marks.</li>
            <li>I am not sure how severe or what kind of results people are expecting.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I purchased it here at Amazon for about half price because that&#x27;s all</li>
            <li>I wasn,t expecting much as mine are quite old</li>
            <li>I definitely feel that ordering the creams was worth a try.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like to be lied to and stolen from, and now I am so pissed I have made it my own personal project to take them down and to stop it from happening to others.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m enjoying the product , I only used it a month, I kind of see an different but its too early to tell ill keep you posted .</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve tried other creams and never seen results as quick as I have seen on this one.</li>
            <li>I am part of the class action lawsuit.</li>
            <li>ordered this a few months ago for the free trial as advertised on tv.</li>
            <li>I am going to try one more time tomorrow and after that I am calling the attorney general to place a complaint.</li>
            <li>Although it does soak into your skin quickly, it leaves it a little sticky feeling for a while</li>
            <li>It glides on smoothly and a little goes a long way</li>
            <li>My stretch marks have almost disappeared, they&#x27;re barely noticeable.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t bare to look at myself.</li>
            <li>After I had my first child two and a half years ago, I had stretch marks everywhere.</li>
            <li>I am a brown skinned black woman and I have both light and dark stretch marks</li>
            <li>I was a little taken back by the price at first</li>
            <li>It is a small enough amount a person would not notice right away.</li>
            <li>The dark ones were my main concern.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> The dark ones were my main concern.</li>
            <li> With the Anew I noticed a change in my stretch marks after a week of use, my skin is very soft and supple feeling in those areas and the stretch marks do seem to be less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I believe it doesn&#x27;t work on old stretch marks and it does have an odd odor.</li>
            <li> Originally, it is pretty pricey for the very small bottle you get.</li>
            <li> works like it says but had a little issue with itchiness for the first few days after applying.</li>
            <li> Celtrixa  is totally not what I expected.</li>
            <li> so i used it anyway &amp; it made A tiny difference but not much</li>
            <li> I ended cancelling my prescription, if you will, to the company after discovering they were charging $3 extra, and immediately cut off any other promotions.</li>
            <li> The lotion isn&#x27;t sticky, just takes forever for it to dry.</li>
            <li> Dark, deep ones on my stomach and hips.</li>
            <li> The stretch marks were so dark and deep</li>
            <li> It works a little but the bottle doesn&#x27;t last that long!</li>
            <li> I still have half a tube left</li>
            <li> Not really seeing any results I need help to get these stretch marks gone</li>
            <li> Do not really see any improvement.</li>
            <li> but idk I&#x27;m starting to just think it&#x27;s a waste of money and ineffective..</li>
            <li> Again I just caught it after a few short months.</li>
            <li> The only reason I&#x27;m not giving it 5 stars is because the company slowly takes extra money from you and never let you know why.</li>
            <li> and so do the 4 other women who bought it with me.</li>
            <li> I can only feel them slightly, and even when I ran out of the bottles and had no more supply the marks still stayed away.</li>
            <li> This is a complete waste of money, especially for such a meager amount of lotion.</li>
            <li> Definitely, not worth it.</li>
            <li> My only complaint during the law suit is that they wanted me to upload my proofs via their website.</li>
            <li> I used a bottle of this stuff and the dark stretch marks on my hips</li>
            <li> The product Is in a very small tube and It barely lasted for a little bit over a week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for about a month and a half now</li>
            <li> and i am slightly fed up with how part of my belly looks</li>
            <li> People who say it does not work just did not use it long enough or correctly, they did something wrong.</li>
            <li> so I had hoped it would have done a little something.</li>
            <li> My opinion, don&#x27;t waste your money on this one.</li>
            <li> I got this from the Hydroxatone website, and it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> so plse dont waste your money or time with this product.</li>
            <li> Do not buy this cream, it&#x27;s a scam and a waste of money!</li>
            <li> i have two small kids</li>
            <li> I had the product only 3 weeks and returned it because it made me itch and was too expensive for the amount received.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the ones on my inner thighs have done nothing.</li>
            <li> Chopped it up as time and money wasted!</li>
            <li> If you are suffering from dark stretch marks I would recommend this product!!!&#x27;</li>
            <li> It sucks , save your money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really not that expensive when buying it from here or eBay.</li>
            <li> I had been going through some dramatic weight gain and weight loss that the skin on my stomach had stretched and looked bloody red.</li>
            <li> I have ugly stretch marks on my stomach, inner thighs and hips from my pregnancy.</li>
            <li> They have been secretly charging me.</li>
            <li> I figured I&#x27;d try it dispite the poor reviews on it.</li>
            <li> It was very expensive for the little bitty bottle.</li>
            <li> but I just wasted it. :(</li>
            <li> This product is too expensive to purchase once a month</li>
            <li> I do not recommend this product it is too expensive ...</li>
            <li> Well I should have listen to all those poor reviews because after using this product for three months stright as directed nothing happened!</li>
            <li> but then again really desperate to get have these marks fade away....</li>
            <li> if you use it as the company intended you to, no one is going to get finished results after just a trail and anyone who would expect to is an idiot!</li>
            <li> Plus it smells awful.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> After I had my first child two and a half years ago, I had stretch marks everywhere. Dark, deep ones on my stomach and hips. I ordered this last summer and it made the color fade into the same color as my skin. I just ordered my second bottle 3 days ago and it already came in the mail. My stretch marks have almost disappeared, they&#x27;re barely noticeable. If you have stretch marks and can&#x27;t find anything that helps, you have got to get this!</li>
            <li> I like this, but do not expect a miracle.</li>
            <li> I order this off tv and it does not work at all. I never wrote a review about anything before but it was a waist of money and i feel like they tried to take advantage of a woman like me thats desprate to get rid of stretch marks.I used it twice a day until it was gone. Like a dummy I didnt send it back on time so I got charged for it. I didnt even want to give this product one star.It sucks , save your money.</li>
            <li> The Celtrixa Cream really does work! I am not sure how severe or what kind of results people are expecting. I noticed the stretch cream work very fast on my stretch marks. Everything takes time and I&#x27;ve tried other creams and never seen results as quick as I have seen on this one.</li>
            <li> my stretch marks faded a bit. I discontinued using it. I think that this is the best cream out there for stretch marks, you just have keep using it. Best way to use it is after showering on clean scrubbed skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for about a month and a half now and Ive seen  no results at all. I reget buying three bottles of this and I do not recommend.</li>
            <li> I tried Celtrixa after I saw a commercial for a 30 day free trial. Definitely, not worth it. I have used inexpensive lotions that are better than Celtrixa. I sent it back asap so they didn&#x27;t charge me $59.99 per bottle. Save your money, don&#x27;t buy this product.</li>
            <li> DOESN&#x27;T WORK! SAVE YOUR MONEY~</li>
            <li> I hope that too many people were not fooled by the commercials on the radio for this product. Originally, it is pretty pricey for the very small bottle you get. I&#x27;m glad I purchased it here at Amazon for about half price because that&#x27;s all it&#x27;s worth. It has a different smell. Although it does soak into your skin quickly, it leaves it a little sticky feeling for a while and you kind of have to use alot since it rubs in fast. I purchased Anew Stretch Mark smoother from Avon recently and absolutely love it! It glides on smoothly and a little goes a long way, it smells better, it&#x27;s cheaper and it works a lot better. With the Celtrixa I noticed no change with 2 weeks of use. With the Anew I noticed a change in my stretch marks after a week of use, my skin is very soft and supple feeling in those areas and the stretch marks do seem to be less noticeable. My opinion, don&#x27;t waste your money on this one.</li>
            <li> It WORKS! Must use as directed to get results. 3 kids NO stretch marks! This stuff worked miracles and I had tried it all. I bought it for the full price twice and went through both tubes and after that they are almost all the way gone. People who say it does not work just did not use it long enough or correctly, they did something wrong. Also get the miroderm abrasion stick so you can use it correctly, when used together this took around 6 weeks and I have results and so do the 4 other women who bought it with me. You will be happy if you use it as the company intended you to, no one is going to get finished results after just a trail and anyone who would expect to is an idiot!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work at all! I have no change in my stretch marks what so ever. Plus it smells awful. Do not buy this cream, it&#x27;s a scam and a waste of money! I figured I&#x27;d try it on amazon because I got a giftcard for my birthday but I just wasted it. :(</li>
            <li> The Hydroxatone Celtrixa lotion is AMAZING!!! Already seeing results! Will be ordering more very very soon!! It is amazing!! GREATT</li>
            <li> Not really seeing any results I need help to get these stretch marks gone so I can be summer ready</li>
            <li> Do not really see any improvement.</li>
            <li> I really didnt see much of a difference maybe alittle bit lighter. It was very expensive for the little bitty bottle. The up side it smelled good.</li>
            <li> I got this from the Hydroxatone website, and it was a waste of money. It did reduce the appearance of my stretchmarks, but only if I used it twice a day, every day. Now that I&#x27;ve run out, my stretchmarks look like I never used celtrixa. This product is too expensive to purchase once a month so I&#x27;m going to try bio oil.</li>
            <li> This did nothing for me maybe you have to use it longer that&#x27;s why I atleast have it 3 stars but idk I&#x27;m starting to just think it&#x27;s a waste of money and ineffective..</li>
            <li> I bought this item because of the great reviews but it didn&#x27;t work for me I believe it doesn&#x27;t work on old stretch marks and it does have an odd odor. I Don&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s because I have Asian skin, but this did not work on me at all. Sure, it made my tummy soft and was a good moisturizer, but if that&#x27;s what you want you&#x27;re way better off buying Aveeno. This is a complete waste of money, especially for such a meager amount of lotion.</li>
            <li> love this helps with stretch marks i have two small kids</li>
            <li> Update: 6/3/2013. I am part of the class action lawsuit. Glad I kept all mi info from two years ago. The lawsuit is drawing towards an end. My only complaint during the law suit is that they wanted me to upload my proofs via their website. However I can&#x27;t do that with a post office tracking sticker, my bank statements and an iPhone. iPhones don&#x27;t scan and the picture of it didn&#x27;t show up. But it has been two years, and though I am glad the suit is going through I will not see as much money compared to what they took from me.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this a few months ago for the free trial as advertised on tv. I had the product only 3 weeks and returned it because it made me itch and was too expensive for the amount received. I called the company and inquired about the requirements to return the product. They ask that you place your order ID on the front of the package so they can Id it, and stated if returned by a certain date I would not be billed any further. I had it to them 3 weeks before that date and assumed everything was done. I also sent this to them certified and tracked. I just enrolled into my banks online banking and looking over my statement I noticed a charge for 3.00 every month from a phone number. Called the number 888-870-8802 many times and have gotten nothing. I googled it and came up with Who&#x27;s calling me. It is the Celetrixa from Hydroxatone. They have been secretly charging me. It is a small enough amount a person would not notice right away. Again I just caught it after a few short months. I am pissed!!!!! I began reading the who&#x27;s calling me report and this is happening to just about every person who has ordered from them. I am going to try one more time tomorrow and after that I am calling the attorney general to place a complaint. I am also going to my bank to try to block any more withdrawls from these pigs. I don&#x27;t like to be lied to and stolen from, and now I am so pissed I have made it my own personal project to take them down and to stop it from happening to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
            <li> Celtrixa  is totally not what I expected. The product Is in a very small tube and It barely lasted for a little bit over a week. I saw no improvements in my stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I was a little taken back by the price at first but then again really desperate to get have these marks fade away.... had a child almost 3 years ago and i am slightly fed up with how part of my belly looks but this cream is not close to bringing you any satisfaction besides its texture smooth &amp; fast absorbent I do not recommend this product it is too expensive ...</li>
            <li> It takes more than 2 weeks for the product to work, this bottle lasted me a month &amp; in that time my stretch marks began to appear lighter and smaller, give it time! i love the results!</li>
            <li> Great product,non greasy,and marks are fading already.</li>
            <li> It works a little but the bottle doesn&#x27;t last that long! You have to use a whole tube before you can see a good improvement!</li>
            <li> Thanks for a smooth transaction. Great product, highly recommend!! 😀😀😀😀</li>
            <li> works like it says but had a little issue with itchiness for the first few days after applying. will be a repeat customer.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see any improvement</li>
            <li> I bought celtrixia through the commercials on TV and even upgraded to get a second bottle for about $56. With the \\&quot;free trial\\&quot; and the special they had I got two bottles for the average price of 1. I ended cancelling my prescription, if you will, to the company after discovering they were charging $3 extra, and immediately cut off any other promotions. I was not about to pay any more than I had too. I had been going through some dramatic weight gain and weight loss that the skin on my stomach had stretched and looked bloody red. The stretch marks were so dark and deep I couldn&#x27;t bare to look at myself. But despite the negative reviews celtrixia was perfect for me. I&#x27;m sure if it has to do with different skin types, but my stretch marks on that area have completely disappeared and are no longer visible. I can only feel them slightly, and even when I ran out of the bottles and had no more supply the marks still stayed away. I definitely feel that ordering the creams was worth a try. For my skin it was a %100 success. The only reason I&#x27;m not giving it 5 stars is because the company slowly takes extra money from you and never let you know why.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m enjoying the product , I only used it a month, I kind of see an different but its too early to tell ill keep you posted .</li>
            <li> I am a brown skinned black woman and I have both light and dark stretch marks or I should say HAD darks stretch marks thanks to this product they are gone!! I used a bottle of this stuff and the dark stretch marks on my hips I&#x27;ve had since I was 12 (now 24) faded!!! The dark ones were my main concern. I give this product only 4 stars because it did not rid me of my light stretch marks... I am now pregnant and will use this product as a preventative... If you are suffering from dark stretch marks I would recommend this product!!!&#x27;</li>
            <li> I Wasn&#x27;t shipped the product that is shown but another product Similar to this &amp; i didn&#x27;t want the hassle of sending it back so i used it anyway &amp; it made A tiny difference but not much, maybe if i had used a few more bottles it would have been better.</li>
            <li> I purchased two bottle of celtrixa right after having my first child. they lasted me about 7 weeks. I put the lotion on every morning and night. I have ugly stretch marks on my stomach, inner thighs and hips from my pregnancy. The stretch marks on my stomach began fading after only a couple weeks and now look way better. Unfortunately the ones on my inner thighs have done nothing. The ones on my thighs are reddish and a lot darker than the ones on my stomach ever were though. Nevertheless, I am purchasing two more bottles. If its made this much of a difference in 7 weeks, I wonder what it will be like in 7 more weeks! It&#x27;s really not that expensive when buying it from here or eBay. Worth the money for sure.</li>
            <li> didnt see any results</li>
            <li> So the product you actually get is a royal blue color with chrome lid. It smells like powdered milk in a way.. I used it for a month straight and it didn&#x27;t do much. I only have a couple of stretch marks so I had hoped it would have done a little something. The lotion isn&#x27;t sticky, just takes forever for it to dry.</li>
            <li> After 2 weeks of applying this cream morning and night I can honestly say I see very little change in the stretch marks. I wasn,t expecting much as mine are quite old but I bought this for my daughters too and theirs are fresh so hopefully they will get better results than I did.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work what so ever not even on throat fresh new stretch marks I had when I purchased the item. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get ride of stretch marks. But it helped reduce the appearance of mine. I use it if mine look visible and usually right after the shower.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product a while back even after I read the reviews. I figured I&#x27;d try it dispite the poor reviews on it. Well I should have listen to all those poor reviews because after using this product for three months stright as directed nothing happened! nothing changed!! so plse dont waste your money or time with this product. I still have half a tube left I ordered two, and I just stopped using it. It wasnt working so there was no need to keep using it. Chopped it up as time and money wasted!</li>
            <li> The product was nicely package, and it was the real prodcut, but i have been using for 3 months now 2 times a day, i have not noticed a whole lot of a difference.</li>
            <li> Did not work. Was not the real product</li>
    </ol>
