            <li>The price was great and it was nice to get a large size.</li>
            <li>My hair was healthy and shiny before I bought this product, but with the winter knocking at my door, I knew my hair was bound to get quite a bit drier, so I picked this up.</li>
            <li>First off this shampoo smells amazing!</li>
            <li>which means I don&#x27;t have to switch shampoos after so many bottles.</li>
            <li>Love the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>After two years, I am sold that salon products are really much better than the drugstore stuff.</li>
            <li>Took 36 years of convincing</li>
            <li>Like its mate, the Tigi shampoo is fabulous!  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>this shampoo is so great, my hair was damaged and fall down a lot, but now it is much much better and it smells good as well</li>

            <li>Not only does it smell great, but the scent lasts all day.</li>
            <li>Makes your hair look and feel smooth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll start with the only good thing I&#x27;ve found about this shampoo.</li>
            <li>Perfect for fine, thin, treated hair.</li>
            <li>I have blonde highlighted fine hair, and I really love it</li>
            <li>I used this for some time and was convinced it was right for me except my hair kept breaking from the damage that a chemical straighener caused.</li>
            <li>After about a month or two of using this product, my hair felt much drier and more brittle than with my old shampoo/conditioner.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many different products to battle the breaking but nothing was working.</li>
            <li>you hair smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>After many years on a different brand, I am a convert to Tigi!</li>
            <li>this product is GREAT for my THICK, wavy hair!  </li>
            <li>I lost so much length</li>
            <li>My hair no longer breaks off as much.</li>
            <li>I like the shampoo, but had to reduce the rating because of the very flimsy and brittle push pump.</li>
            <li>Expensive, smells nice and does make the hair really shiny and silky smooth though.</li>
            <li>I was able to find it online as it is much more expensive buying through the salon.</li>
            <li>It really makes my curly hair soft</li>
            <li>It smelled nice, but it had too many harsh chemicals and it end up irritating my scalp.</li>
            <li>My hair has never felt so soft!</li>
            <li>She said it helps keep her hair soft.</li>
            <li>it really helps with frizz and makes it easier to flat iron.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to give the product the benefit of the doubt, and so I blamed the problem on my longer than normal curls, but after switching back to my old shampoo, I&#x27;ve had no</li>
            <li>During the winter I do need to use a little more product to avoid dry hair (I live in the desert), but overall, it keeps my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>That left my hair very fried and would constantly break off.</li>
            <li>The company should make it strong at least to last for the usage of the bottle.</li>
            <li>Does not dry out hair or scalp.</li>

            <li> Fine for daily use, dramatic improvement of health of hair.</li>
            <li> I had very dark red hair and decided to go back to my natural blonde hair.</li>
            <li> I have long curly hair.</li>
            <li> I have very dry, damaged and brittle hair.</li>
            <li> I straighten my hair every time i wash it, which is every other 2 to 3 days.</li>
            <li> I can even use every other day.</li>
            <li> Other than that I like the shampoo.</li>
            <li> I can say it seems to dry out my scalp a little bit.</li>
            <li> shipping took a little longer than expected, but was during the holiday season.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo/conditioner for a couple years now and it still hasn&#x27;t let me down.</li>
            <li> I previously reviewed the conditioner thinking it was the shampoo since I didn&#x27;t expand the title, so forgive my mistake.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed that my hair that is not damaged seems less shiny when I use this shampoo.</li>
            <li> It is really odd.</li>
            <li> If it breaks it will be a mess.</li>
            <li> Little dab does it.</li>
            <li> I want to say it has helped a little bit</li>
            <li> /&gt;SO - if you have silky straight hair that would be practically impossible to tangle, this product might be for you.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-I straighten my hair at least 5-6 days a week</li>
            <li> The pump portion that holds the pump straw and the cap has a very weak connection.</li>
            <li> I was so surprisingly shocked</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start with the only good thing I&#x27;ve found about this shampoo. It smells GREAT. Not only does it smell great, but the scent lasts all day. I love it when my hair smells good all day. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, on to the reasons I gave this product such a low rating. I have long curly hair. My hair was healthy and shiny before I bought this product, but with the winter knocking at my door, I knew my hair was bound to get quite a bit drier, so I picked this up. After about a month or two of using this product, my hair felt much drier and more brittle than with my old shampoo/conditioner. I also found that this product creates incredibly stubborn tangles and knots in my hair. Even if I brush my hair prior to getting in the shower, as soon as I lather up, my hair tangles up. I&#x27;ve NEVER had a problem with severe tangles before (quite a feat for a curly-haired girl!), but I&#x27;ve fought tangles the size of Texas while using this product. I wanted to give the product the benefit of the doubt, and so I blamed the problem on my longer than normal curls, but after switching back to my old shampoo, I&#x27;ve had no problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SO - if you have silky straight hair that would be practically impossible to tangle, this product might be for you. All others, beware!</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo/conditioner for a couple years now and it still hasn&#x27;t let me down. During the winter I do need to use a little more product to avoid dry hair (I live in the desert), but overall, it keeps my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> Smells like fruity pebbles.</li>
            <li> this shampoo is so great, my hair was damaged and fall down a lot, but now it is much much better and it smells good as well</li>
            <li> I have very dry, damaged and brittle hair. I had very dark red hair and decided to go back to my natural blonde hair. That left my hair very fried and would constantly break off. I lost so much length and i felt like my hair would not grow! I have tried so many different products to battle the breaking but nothing was working. I always saw wonderful reviews about this product but the price was a bit high. I found this shampoo at Marshalls and decided it was time to try it. Boy am i happy i did! First off this shampoo smells amazing! My hair has never felt so soft! I straighten my hair every time i wash it, which is every other 2 to 3 days. My hair no longer breaks off as much. My hair seems to be gaining length and i cant wait to continue using this product. If you have problematic hair definitely give this a try.</li>
            <li> Perfect for fine, thin, treated hair. Never builds up either-which means I don&#x27;t have to switch shampoos after so many bottles.</li>
            <li> It smelled nice, but it had too many harsh chemicals and it end up irritating my scalp.</li>
            <li> This shampoo works great leaves you hair smooth and soft. I had problems finding a shampoo that did not brake my scalp out thill I found this one. My wife loves this one also.</li>
            <li> this is the only shampoo that I ever use.  the best!! love bed head products!!  shipping took a little longer than expected, but was during the holiday season.</li>
            <li> Love the shampoo and conditioner. It smells good, makes hair soft and really smells good.</li>
            <li> this product is GREAT for my THICK, wavy hair!  it really helps with frizz and makes it easier to flat iron.  also it smells wonderful!!!</li>
            <li> This is a great product. Fine for daily use, dramatic improvement of health of hair. I&#x27;ve given it to friends and everyone has loved it!</li>
            <li> My friend recommended this product to me. She said it helps keep her hair soft. I finally decided to order it and I recieved it within 3 days of ordering it! I was so surprisingly shocked when I got home with this at my door!&lt;br /&gt;I used it once and Immediately I got hooked! My hair was already softer and felt nicer to brush out without putting any products in it.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this to ANYONE who uses a straightener or a curling iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-I straighten my hair at least 5-6 days a week and I can already tell the difference after only 3 times of washing my hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo (and conditioner) at the behest of my stylist. After two years, I am sold that salon products are really much better than the drugstore stuff. Took 36 years of convincing but I am convinced. I like that I was able to find it online as it is much more expensive buying through the salon. I will be a bedhead for life.</li>
            <li> Like its mate, the Tigi shampoo is fabulous!  I previously reviewed the conditioner thinking it was the shampoo since I didn&#x27;t expand the title, so forgive my mistake.  Both products are wonderful, and I love them.  After many years on a different brand, I am a convert to Tigi!</li>
            <li> I loved the way it made my hair feel and I liked the smell.  The price was great and it was nice to get a large size.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff - excellent delivery</li>
            <li> Only shampoo my husband will use. He showers with it too.</li>
            <li> Expensive, smells nice and does make the hair really shiny and silky smooth though. I would recommend this brand to others.</li>
            <li> It really makes my curly hair soft</li>
            <li> Little dab does it. I can even use every other day. Does not dry out hair or scalp. Makes your hair look and feel smooth.</li>
            <li> Nice fruity scent. I used this for some time and was convinced it was right for me except my hair kept breaking from the damage that a chemical straighener caused. I&#x27;m still on fence and use this off and on. I want to say it has helped a little bit but I&#x27;m still unsure. I have noticed that my hair that is not damaged seems less shiny when I use this shampoo. Though only at times. It is really odd. I can say it seems to dry out my scalp a little bit.</li>
            <li> I like the shampoo, but had to reduce the rating because of the very flimsy and brittle push pump. If it breaks it will be a mess. The pump portion that holds the pump straw and the cap has a very weak connection. The company should make it strong at least to last for the usage of the bottle. Other than that I like the shampoo.</li>
            <li> This has the sweetest fragrance of all the shampoos I&#x27;ve tried. Almost like Cotton Candy. Love it. I have used this brand for years and Amazon doesn&#x27;t disappoint with who they get the best price from.</li>
            <li> This Shampoo is GREAT! I love it lathers nice, smells great and leaves hair soft and Smooth but not flat. I have blonde highlighted fine hair, and I really love it I would try it out for sure!!! The Conditioner is great too !</li>
            <li> wonderful. its very..very..very..good !!!</li>
