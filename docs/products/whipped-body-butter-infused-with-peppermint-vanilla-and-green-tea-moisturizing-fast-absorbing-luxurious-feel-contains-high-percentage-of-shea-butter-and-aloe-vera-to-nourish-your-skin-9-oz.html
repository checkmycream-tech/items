            <li>This was a nice splurge.</li>
            <li>Nice and creamy, and leaves my skin dewy but not greasy.  </li>
            <li>Mosturizes nicely.</li>
            <li>And the jar is nice</li>
            <li>It works well on skin, fragrance is nice (not too minty) but not overpowering.</li>
            <li>a nice whipped souffl√© texture.</li>
            <li>Absolutely the BEST!</li>
            <li>It has a strong, but pleasant, smell of peppermint.</li>
            <li>The peppermint scent is pleasant and fades to light scent within five minutes or so.</li>
            <li>It smells great and is super creamy.</li>
            <li>but it spreads very easy.</li>
            <li>but the smell absorbs and leave a light scent on you in a good way.</li>
            <li>Feels so good right after a shower!  </li>
            <li>and it makes my skin feel very smooth.</li>
            <li>chose 5 stars because as a body butter, it is smooth and spreads easily, and smells good.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re a massage therapist like me it has a great lube without being slippery so you can get some good grip for deep tissue massage.</li>
            <li>and I love knowing that it is mostly organic in ingredients.  </li>
            <li>It smells like mint flavored chocolate, which I love to eat, but not smell on my skin.</li>
            <li>Thank you Better Shea Butter.  </li>
            <li>When it runs out, I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li>and I thought why not what&#x27;s one more to try</li>
            <li>I love the lotion, it is soothing and moisturizing for all day.</li>
            <li>I love this product....</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know, perhaps I just don&#x27;t buy many products like this.  </li>
            <li>it works great, leaving skin much softer.  </li>
            <li>And I love the smell -</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get the overwhelming peppermint smell that some are reporting...</li>
            <li>and I noticed that halfway through the day I felt like I needed some more.</li>
            <li>My clients love it.  </li>
            <li>It goes on nice and smooth and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy by the end of the session.  </li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s winter and my skin is more prone to dryness.</li>
            <li>The peppermint scent is refreshing.</li>
            <li>Love the texture of this cream.  </li>
            <li>If you love dessert-y smells you will love this.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance is soothing, relaxing, calming and refreshing.  </li>
            <li>I received so many compliments</li>
            <li>Love, Love, Love this product.  </li>
            <li>Will be ordering more:-)</li>
            <li>Shea butter is ok.  </li>
            <li>might really translate to fly by night.  </li>
            <li>I just love this product, I put in on every time I think about it, because I just LOVE the smell.</li>
            <li>I like how it makes my skin look like it&#x27;s sexy glowing</li>
            <li>It absorbs fast, great for the body.</li>
            <li>look forward to more products from this company...</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Refreshing peppermint</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>Glad I found this.</li>
            <li>Unusual texture but goes on nicely, good moisturizing properties, nice smell.</li>
            <li>Would like more lavender scent.</li>
            <li>And love the peppermint smell.</li>
            <li>Love all your products</li>
            <li>I do love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Very rich.</li>
            <li>The ingredients are high quality &amp; moisturizes the skin great.  </li>
            <li>But the whipped formula is great and it&#x27;s not too heavy feeling which is great</li>
            <li>The peppermint smell is refreshing, not too strong.</li>
            <li>It is wonderful on my dry skin.</li>
            <li>Silky smooth, love the light peppermint scent!</li>
            <li>Smells very earthy, which is a good thing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m super excited to see that this is made here in AUSTIN, TX and plan to stalk the maker of this fine product to see if I can get more concoctions whipped up!  </li>
            <li>I ordered this Shea butter for the first time and I love it!</li>
            <li>It goes on easily, smells great and makes my skin feel soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is there but not too strong to be worn with a perfume.</li>
            <li>I would give this cream 5 stars because it is very rich and luscious and feels nice on the skin, but I was very deceived by the description.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ready to buy more!</li>
            <li>It also has a nice soothing, mild buttery/peppermint aroma &amp; also gives a nice, soft peppermint tingly flare on the skin (not overpowering).  </li>
            <li>After 8 days of putting this on, I am noticing a huge difference in my hands, and I noticed that I have been sleeping like a baby.</li>
            <li>the luxurious creamy feel everything is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure about the peppermint smell at first, but now I really like it; it&#x27;s very refreshing for summer.  </li>
            <li>Texture is wonderful -  fluffy &amp; whipped plus it absorbs quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>it is available orderless or in a cleaner, simpler smell I will re order.</li>
            <li>It is really, truly amazing...</li>
            <li>Which I did, giving a thoughtful  email w suggestions.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and not greasy</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, it lasts, and it works.  </li>
            <li>Love the peppermint scent, it reminds me of a girl scout cookie but is not too overpowering after it is absorbed.</li>
            <li>When I first opened it I wasn&#x27;t sure how I&#x27;d like the smell, it truly smells like all the ingredients</li>
            <li>Today is the first time that I used the Better Shea Butter on both my face and body.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not as creamy and rich feeling either.</li>
            <li>This would be GREAT for anyone with dry skin needing hydration.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly and fully with no greasy feel.</li>
            <li>At first, I got a kind response justifying why the PET jar was used, which was appreciated.  </li>
            <li>It leaves your skin nice and soft not grease.  </li>
            <li>top can be a deterrent to using this as much as I&#x27;d really like to.</li>
            <li>Thanks for making a clean product that actually smells great</li>
            <li>The consistency is great (not too anything - greasy, heavy, light, etc.)</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly into the skin and has a relaxing yet uplifting scent.  </li>
            <li>It states that it&#x27;s infused with Peppermint &amp; Lavender essential oils, and yes the peppermint is very very prominent, but instead of lavender I smell a sweet creamy almost chocolatey smell.</li>
            <li>The peppermint is not very strong, it has lavender and vanilla too, and it&#x27;s just great.</li>
            <li>I initially gave this product 5 stars because the moisturizer is pretty good.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve just recently started using this product and I must say I love it!</li>
            <li>I love the minty smell and how soft the lotion makes my skin!</li>
            <li>Will definitely be ordering more!</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy more!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using it on my legs and feet, and will definitely buy more when this is gone!  </li>
            <li>and I love the stuff it leaves my skin feeling soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>and I initially came to Amazon to buy some bulk shea butter and cocoa butter for mixing my own custom body products.  </li>
            <li>I was not crazy about the scent.  </li>
            <li>What a nice present to myself!</li>
            <li>Took a while to receive, but it was worth the wait.</li>
            <li>It has the wonderful Shea butter moisturizing quality but is blended in such a way as to not have the characteristic &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; feel of the pure shea butter.  </li>
            <li>Also, it feels like silky butter on my legs right after shaving.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just the right consistency.</li>
            <li>And I am very happy with it - it is fresh, natural and you really need just few dabs.  </li>
            <li>Although I liked the whipped organic Shea body butter with the Aloe Vera, the smell was way to strong to use as an everyday moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I use it mostly for my hands and just after the weeks use I already see a significant difference in my skin - it is much softer, smother and much younger looking.  </li>
            <li>This is not only great for my skin, but I&#x27;ve had several people tell me that I smell like cotton candy, cookies, etc.  </li>
            <li>i liked it so much i bought a second jar!</li>
            <li>Quick Absorbing.  </li>
            <li>I have several brands and formulations of natural, shea-based butters, but I feel that this one is truly exceptional.  </li>
            <li>It has a strong peppermint smell when you first put it on, but then turns into a very mellow, mild scent (which apparently to some, smells like cookies and candy).</li>
            <li>Pure heaven right there.</li>
            <li>;)&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like this product!</li>
            <li>But when I first put it on, I always have to apply it twice.</li>
            <li>My skin felt soft and smooth without being greasy or sticky.</li>
            <li>I will repurchase this if there is another essential oil blend which is more natural/earthy smelling.</li>
            <li>Smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>The peppermint is pretty pungent.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is my second purchase, and I know I will buy more.</li>
            <li>THANKS!</li>
            <li>Definitely will be purchasing more.  </li>
            <li>Would prefer another scent like citrus (orange, lemon) or some other nice smelling scent.</li>
            <li>You have gained a new loyal customer.</li>
            <li>The peppermint is initially a light refreshing scent, but what is left behind on your skin is more of a light vanilla scent.</li>
            <li>and after just 3 days, I can see a positive difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li>All natural products are used, smells very organic, and leaves your skin feeling so soft and looking healthy.</li>
            <li>Not exactly what I wanted - the odor is very strong</li>
            <li>I feel that this will work better during the summer when my skin isn&#x27;t as dry.</li>
            <li>the scent is purely heavenly..</li>
            <li>and so I wasn&#x27;t certain of what to expect.</li>
            <li>This is a great moisturizer and really needed since I live in such a dry climate here in New Mexico.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still leaning towards splurging haha.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing, not greasy.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>The photo really looks like the product is in a glass jar.  </li>
            <li>They really should mention it in the product description, but I take part of the blame for not inquiring with the seller.  </li>
            <li>He immediately asked me why I smelled so unusual.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>It did absolutely nothing for my body.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s non greasy and as with the peppermint infusion would be very helpful if one has arthritis.</li>
            <li>Very creamy and calming/cool sensation.</li>
            <li>The smell is not overpowering and has a gentle peppermint aroma.</li>
            <li>When the product first arrived (on a very hot day), the oils and shea butter had separated somewhat, but I shook it up several times over the next few days and now it&#x27;s all blended together again -- a small price to pay for a great product with simple, effective ingredients!</li>
            <li>I like the product, love how it makes my skin feel, but I&#x27;m just not sure it&#x27;s worth the size.</li>
            <li>I thought that it would be a bit overpowering, but it is subtle and all the ingredients are good for your skin.  </li>
            <li>not bad i wish they could put it in bigger container</li>
            <li>Like I said, the product is okay, cheaper than other 25% Shea butters!</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t believe in this stuff until now - I HIGHLY recommend this product.</li>
            <li>skin is very dry and it keeps it moist and free from cracking, so that it doesn&#x27;t itch or hurt.  </li>
            <li>In fact, I wish it lingered a little more -it&#x27;s heavenly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wish they offered something a little more portable, or something with a pump, and maybe something purse sized, while I&#x27;m suggesting.</li>
            <li>I just think to pay for an organic moisturizer at this price level from a company that puts so much effort into a healthier, all natural product begs the question &#x27;why cheapen the deal with plastic&#x27;?  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally take the time to write reviews.....</li>
            <li>Great for this dry late winter/early spring weather</li>
            <li>it does die down a bit after use, but it&#x27;s still too strong to wear out.</li>
            <li>I wanted to try this, as I wanted to try a new, startup vendor.  </li>
            <li>However, I think this is either a new product for this company or one that they are testing so there have been a couple of times when I wanted to order</li>
            <li>It makes your skin feel like silk in a very natural and organic way...</li>
            <li>whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very sensitive to chemicals and scents, and the smell is in no way overpowering.  </li>
            <li>the peppermint scent is pretty strong (for me at least).</li>
            <li>Chances are, if you are like me, you research your health &amp; what you put on &amp; in your body, hence taking every measure possible to keep toxins away, so your target market will most likely fork over that extra buck for a glass container.  </li>
            <li>I was not sure about this to begin with, but my wife promised that there was nothing better for your skin than shea butter.</li>
            <li>Not as smooth as other brands, and it separates a bit, which I accept, given this is a natural,</li>
            <li>WOW!  </li>
            <li>Fresh and clean only need to little bit.</li>
            <li>It has a slight scent of peppermint, no greasy feel, and leaves your skin feeling soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Oh, and if you are interested in finding out more of what was mentioned above involving plastic in our lives &amp; the dangerous health effects, then I highly recommend a documentary called &#x27;Plastic Planet&#x27; by Werner Boote (can purchase it right here on Amazon ;).  </li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t come across a lot of clear plastic jars with METAL lids.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m truly a natural and organic product enthusiast</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s all natural..</li>
            <li>It consists of natural products.</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin soft all day...</li>
            <li>There is a growing awareness &amp; indisputable evidence now that nearly all plastics (including PET) are leaching chemicals, so I try to avoid them.  </li>
            <li>and it makes my face soft.</li>
            <li>Well, my wife told me that peppermint oil was a natural relaxant, which makes sense.</li>
            <li>And I am picky, sensitive to smells.</li>
            <li>Like the creamy texture and the way it makes my skin feel-very soft.</li>
            <li>so I was surprised when this didn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li>It helped but didn&#x27;t take it away completely.</li>
            <li>The picture had me thinking I was getting a normal sized jar, but the jar is smaller than normal.</li>
            <li>It feels uncomfortable in that it feels like it has tightened my skin (and not in a good way).</li>
            <li>I love the subtle fragrance as well.  </li>
            <li>It has a light minty scent, but not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>When I wake up the next day my skin is still soft (not greasy at all!).</li>
            <li>I also thought at first the smell was overpowering ( I&#x27;m only use to unscented products), but when I got it on my skin, it sunk in and became a natural soothing peppermint scent, very subtle and quite cool to the feel.  </li>
            <li>Nice product but too expensive for the size of the jar.</li>
            <li>Upon receipt, I got an email asking me to comment on other proposed scents etc for products, and promising a gift of an additional product I. Return.  </li>
            <li>It has a very faint smell of peppermint when first applied, but after it smells more like coco.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to anyone, especially if you have dry skin.</li>
            <li>The thing that struck me instantly was how pungent the smell of the product is - it has a positively nauseating smelling of sour milk, chocolate and peppermint.</li>
            <li>This is the first lotion that has had lasting impact and created soft skin in just a few uses!</li>
            <li>After I write this review, I am going to jump in the shower to wash my whole body down.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this cream; I bought it less than a month ago and was horribly disappointed to see that it is currently out of stock when I went to buy more.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like the first time isn&#x27;t enough, my face starts to feel tight and dry.</li>

            <li> The smell is amazing.</li>
            <li> It smells great and goes on smooth not greasy.</li>
            <li> and it feels amazing on my hands and body.</li>
            <li> The Peppermint Infused Body Butter is amazing.</li>
            <li> This lotion has a nice scent.  </li>
            <li> I am loving this product.</li>
            <li> This was a nice splurge.</li>
            <li> Nice and creamy, and leaves my skin dewy but not greasy.  </li>
            <li> Mosturizes nicely.</li>
            <li> And the jar is nice</li>
            <li> It works well on skin, fragrance is nice (not too minty) but not overpowering.</li>
            <li> a nice whipped souffl√© texture.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the BEST!</li>
            <li> It has a strong, but pleasant, smell of peppermint.</li>
            <li> The peppermint scent is pleasant and fades to light scent within five minutes or so.</li>
            <li> It smells great and is super creamy.</li>
            <li> but it spreads very easy.</li>
            <li> but the smell absorbs and leave a light scent on you in a good way.</li>
            <li> Feels so good right after a shower!  </li>
            <li> and it makes my skin feel very smooth.</li>
            <li> chose 5 stars because as a body butter, it is smooth and spreads easily, and smells good.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a massage therapist like me it has a great lube without being slippery so you can get some good grip for deep tissue massage.</li>
            <li> and I love knowing that it is mostly organic in ingredients.  </li>
            <li> It smells like mint flavored chocolate, which I love to eat, but not smell on my skin.</li>
            <li> Thank you Better Shea Butter.  </li>
            <li> When it runs out, I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> and I thought why not what&#x27;s one more to try</li>
            <li> I love the lotion, it is soothing and moisturizing for all day.</li>
            <li> I love this product....</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know, perhaps I just don&#x27;t buy many products like this.  </li>
            <li> it works great, leaving skin much softer.  </li>
            <li> And I love the smell -</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get the overwhelming peppermint smell that some are reporting...</li>
            <li> and I noticed that halfway through the day I felt like I needed some more.</li>
            <li> My clients love it.  </li>
            <li> It goes on nice and smooth and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy by the end of the session.  </li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s winter and my skin is more prone to dryness.</li>
            <li> The peppermint scent is refreshing.</li>
            <li> Love the texture of this cream.  </li>
            <li> If you love dessert-y smells you will love this.  </li>
            <li> The fragrance is soothing, relaxing, calming and refreshing.  </li>
            <li> I received so many compliments</li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love this product.  </li>
            <li> Will be ordering more:-)</li>
            <li> Shea butter is ok.  </li>
            <li> might really translate to fly by night.  </li>
            <li> I just love this product, I put in on every time I think about it, because I just LOVE the smell.</li>
            <li> I like how it makes my skin look like it&#x27;s sexy glowing</li>
            <li> It absorbs fast, great for the body.</li>
            <li> look forward to more products from this company...</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> Refreshing peppermint</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> Glad I found this.</li>
            <li> Unusual texture but goes on nicely, good moisturizing properties, nice smell.</li>
            <li> Would like more lavender scent.</li>
            <li> And love the peppermint smell.</li>
            <li> Love all your products</li>
            <li> I do love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Very rich.</li>
            <li> The ingredients are high quality &amp; moisturizes the skin great.  </li>
            <li> But the whipped formula is great and it&#x27;s not too heavy feeling which is great</li>
            <li> The peppermint smell is refreshing, not too strong.</li>
            <li> It is wonderful on my dry skin.</li>
            <li> Silky smooth, love the light peppermint scent!</li>
            <li> Smells very earthy, which is a good thing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super excited to see that this is made here in AUSTIN, TX and plan to stalk the maker of this fine product to see if I can get more concoctions whipped up!  </li>
            <li> I ordered this Shea butter for the first time and I love it!</li>
            <li> It goes on easily, smells great and makes my skin feel soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is there but not too strong to be worn with a perfume.</li>
            <li> I would give this cream 5 stars because it is very rich and luscious and feels nice on the skin, but I was very deceived by the description.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ready to buy more!</li>
            <li> It also has a nice soothing, mild buttery/peppermint aroma &amp; also gives a nice, soft peppermint tingly flare on the skin (not overpowering).  </li>
            <li> After 8 days of putting this on, I am noticing a huge difference in my hands, and I noticed that I have been sleeping like a baby.</li>
            <li> the luxurious creamy feel everything is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about the peppermint smell at first, but now I really like it; it&#x27;s very refreshing for summer.  </li>
            <li> Texture is wonderful -  fluffy &amp; whipped plus it absorbs quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> it is available orderless or in a cleaner, simpler smell I will re order.</li>
            <li> It is really, truly amazing...</li>
            <li> Which I did, giving a thoughtful  email w suggestions.  </li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and not greasy</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, it lasts, and it works.  </li>
            <li> Love the peppermint scent, it reminds me of a girl scout cookie but is not too overpowering after it is absorbed.</li>
            <li> When I first opened it I wasn&#x27;t sure how I&#x27;d like the smell, it truly smells like all the ingredients</li>
            <li> Today is the first time that I used the Better Shea Butter on both my face and body.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not as creamy and rich feeling either.</li>
            <li> This would be GREAT for anyone with dry skin needing hydration.  </li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly and fully with no greasy feel.</li>
            <li> At first, I got a kind response justifying why the PET jar was used, which was appreciated.  </li>
            <li> It leaves your skin nice and soft not grease.  </li>
            <li> top can be a deterrent to using this as much as I&#x27;d really like to.</li>
            <li> Thanks for making a clean product that actually smells great</li>
            <li> The consistency is great (not too anything - greasy, heavy, light, etc.)</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly into the skin and has a relaxing yet uplifting scent.  </li>
            <li> It states that it&#x27;s infused with Peppermint &amp; Lavender essential oils, and yes the peppermint is very very prominent, but instead of lavender I smell a sweet creamy almost chocolatey smell.</li>
            <li> The peppermint is not very strong, it has lavender and vanilla too, and it&#x27;s just great.</li>
            <li> I initially gave this product 5 stars because the moisturizer is pretty good.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just recently started using this product and I must say I love it!</li>
            <li> I love the minty smell and how soft the lotion makes my skin!</li>
            <li> Will definitely be ordering more!</li>
            <li> I will definitely buy more!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it on my legs and feet, and will definitely buy more when this is gone!  </li>
            <li> and I love the stuff it leaves my skin feeling soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> and I initially came to Amazon to buy some bulk shea butter and cocoa butter for mixing my own custom body products.  </li>
            <li> I was not crazy about the scent.  </li>
            <li> What a nice present to myself!</li>
            <li> Took a while to receive, but it was worth the wait.</li>
            <li> It has the wonderful Shea butter moisturizing quality but is blended in such a way as to not have the characteristic &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; feel of the pure shea butter.  </li>
            <li> Also, it feels like silky butter on my legs right after shaving.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just the right consistency.</li>
            <li> And I am very happy with it - it is fresh, natural and you really need just few dabs.  </li>
            <li> Although I liked the whipped organic Shea body butter with the Aloe Vera, the smell was way to strong to use as an everyday moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I use it mostly for my hands and just after the weeks use I already see a significant difference in my skin - it is much softer, smother and much younger looking.  </li>
            <li> This is not only great for my skin, but I&#x27;ve had several people tell me that I smell like cotton candy, cookies, etc.  </li>
            <li> i liked it so much i bought a second jar!</li>
            <li> Quick Absorbing.  </li>
            <li> I have several brands and formulations of natural, shea-based butters, but I feel that this one is truly exceptional.  </li>
            <li> It has a strong peppermint smell when you first put it on, but then turns into a very mellow, mild scent (which apparently to some, smells like cookies and candy).</li>
            <li> Pure heaven right there.</li>
            <li> ;)&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like this product!</li>
            <li> But when I first put it on, I always have to apply it twice.</li>
            <li> My skin felt soft and smooth without being greasy or sticky.</li>
            <li> I will repurchase this if there is another essential oil blend which is more natural/earthy smelling.</li>
            <li> Smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> The peppermint is pretty pungent.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase, and I know I will buy more.</li>
            <li> THANKS!</li>
            <li> Definitely will be purchasing more.  </li>
            <li> Would prefer another scent like citrus (orange, lemon) or some other nice smelling scent.</li>
            <li> You have gained a new loyal customer.</li>
            <li> The peppermint is initially a light refreshing scent, but what is left behind on your skin is more of a light vanilla scent.</li>
            <li> and after just 3 days, I can see a positive difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li> All natural products are used, smells very organic, and leaves your skin feeling so soft and looking healthy.</li>
            <li> Not exactly what I wanted - the odor is very strong</li>
            <li> I feel that this will work better during the summer when my skin isn&#x27;t as dry.</li>
            <li> the scent is purely heavenly..</li>
            <li> and so I wasn&#x27;t certain of what to expect.</li>
            <li> This is a great moisturizer and really needed since I live in such a dry climate here in New Mexico.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still leaning towards splurging haha.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing, not greasy.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> The photo really looks like the product is in a glass jar.  </li>
            <li> They really should mention it in the product description, but I take part of the blame for not inquiring with the seller.  </li>
            <li> He immediately asked me why I smelled so unusual.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> It did absolutely nothing for my body.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s non greasy and as with the peppermint infusion would be very helpful if one has arthritis.</li>
            <li> Very creamy and calming/cool sensation.</li>
            <li> The smell is not overpowering and has a gentle peppermint aroma.</li>
            <li> When the product first arrived (on a very hot day), the oils and shea butter had separated somewhat, but I shook it up several times over the next few days and now it&#x27;s all blended together again -- a small price to pay for a great product with simple, effective ingredients!</li>
            <li> I like the product, love how it makes my skin feel, but I&#x27;m just not sure it&#x27;s worth the size.</li>
            <li> I thought that it would be a bit overpowering, but it is subtle and all the ingredients are good for your skin.  </li>
            <li> not bad i wish they could put it in bigger container</li>
            <li> Like I said, the product is okay, cheaper than other 25% Shea butters!</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t believe in this stuff until now - I HIGHLY recommend this product.</li>
            <li> skin is very dry and it keeps it moist and free from cracking, so that it doesn&#x27;t itch or hurt.  </li>
            <li> In fact, I wish it lingered a little more -it&#x27;s heavenly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wish they offered something a little more portable, or something with a pump, and maybe something purse sized, while I&#x27;m suggesting.</li>
            <li> I just think to pay for an organic moisturizer at this price level from a company that puts so much effort into a healthier, all natural product begs the question &#x27;why cheapen the deal with plastic&#x27;?  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally take the time to write reviews.....</li>
            <li> Great for this dry late winter/early spring weather</li>
            <li> it does die down a bit after use, but it&#x27;s still too strong to wear out.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this, as I wanted to try a new, startup vendor.  </li>
            <li> However, I think this is either a new product for this company or one that they are testing so there have been a couple of times when I wanted to order</li>
            <li> It makes your skin feel like silk in a very natural and organic way...</li>
            <li> whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very sensitive to chemicals and scents, and the smell is in no way overpowering.  </li>
            <li> the peppermint scent is pretty strong (for me at least).</li>
            <li> Chances are, if you are like me, you research your health &amp; what you put on &amp; in your body, hence taking every measure possible to keep toxins away, so your target market will most likely fork over that extra buck for a glass container.  </li>
            <li> I was not sure about this to begin with, but my wife promised that there was nothing better for your skin than shea butter.</li>
            <li> Not as smooth as other brands, and it separates a bit, which I accept, given this is a natural,</li>
            <li> WOW!  </li>
            <li> Fresh and clean only need to little bit.</li>
            <li> It has a slight scent of peppermint, no greasy feel, and leaves your skin feeling soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Oh, and if you are interested in finding out more of what was mentioned above involving plastic in our lives &amp; the dangerous health effects, then I highly recommend a documentary called &#x27;Plastic Planet&#x27; by Werner Boote (can purchase it right here on Amazon ;).  </li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t come across a lot of clear plastic jars with METAL lids.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m truly a natural and organic product enthusiast</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s all natural..</li>
            <li> It consists of natural products.</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin soft all day...</li>
            <li> There is a growing awareness &amp; indisputable evidence now that nearly all plastics (including PET) are leaching chemicals, so I try to avoid them.  </li>
            <li> and it makes my face soft.</li>
            <li> Well, my wife told me that peppermint oil was a natural relaxant, which makes sense.</li>
            <li> And I am picky, sensitive to smells.</li>
            <li> Like the creamy texture and the way it makes my skin feel-very soft.</li>
            <li> so I was surprised when this didn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li> It helped but didn&#x27;t take it away completely.</li>
            <li> The picture had me thinking I was getting a normal sized jar, but the jar is smaller than normal.</li>
            <li> It feels uncomfortable in that it feels like it has tightened my skin (and not in a good way).</li>
            <li> I love the subtle fragrance as well.  </li>
            <li> It has a light minty scent, but not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> When I wake up the next day my skin is still soft (not greasy at all!).</li>
            <li> I also thought at first the smell was overpowering ( I&#x27;m only use to unscented products), but when I got it on my skin, it sunk in and became a natural soothing peppermint scent, very subtle and quite cool to the feel.  </li>
            <li> Nice product but too expensive for the size of the jar.</li>
            <li> Upon receipt, I got an email asking me to comment on other proposed scents etc for products, and promising a gift of an additional product I. Return.  </li>
            <li> It has a very faint smell of peppermint when first applied, but after it smells more like coco.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to anyone, especially if you have dry skin.</li>
            <li> The thing that struck me instantly was how pungent the smell of the product is - it has a positively nauseating smelling of sour milk, chocolate and peppermint.</li>
            <li> This is the first lotion that has had lasting impact and created soft skin in just a few uses!</li>
            <li> After I write this review, I am going to jump in the shower to wash my whole body down.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this cream; I bought it less than a month ago and was horribly disappointed to see that it is currently out of stock when I went to buy more.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like the first time isn&#x27;t enough, my face starts to feel tight and dry.</li>
            <li> ( I have psoriasis ) and was absolutely amazed at how little I had to use to go such a long way.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick enough to give good moisture and soften but not too thick that it leaves a heavy oily coating o.</li>
            <li> Despite the price point, the product did last a long time.</li>
            <li> , I initially purchased to use as a hand cream during the dry winter months.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had such dry skin this winter</li>
            <li> I felt dried out, so I wanted to find something all natural without any chemicals or fillers.  </li>
            <li> and I hope this cream is around for a long time as I intend to use it.</li>
            <li> Smell is a strange sort of musty peppermint.</li>
            <li> These chemicals including (BPA), not only affect you but future generations in our lineage, meaning you pass this damage on down to your children.  </li>
            <li> I have suffered from dry skin for as long as I can remember.</li>
            <li> Call me fanatical about my health, but it was something I simply had to mention for other buyers that also like to do research like me.  </li>
            <li> I put it on after showering and my skin was still extremely dry.</li>
            <li> I hope they make a formula for dry hands too...</li>
            <li> my cuticles are always dry from washing all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have really dry hands</li>
            <li> and I still had my dry prickly skin.</li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s a let down because I am trying to get plastic out of my life as much as possible.  </li>
            <li> You only need a little bit of this to go a long way.  </li>
            <li> product not the same as previous orders, something has changed</li>
            <li> I have very dry hand skin</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because I wish it lasted a little longer.</li>
            <li> I use it during the day, at night, and sometimes before yoga classes if my skin needs a little extra moisture.  </li>
            <li> i hope to see this product with other aromas or none at all.</li>
            <li> No it&#x27;s such a small bottle, am I going to use this up in a week.  </li>
            <li> Usually even when I use a standard lotion that goes away</li>
            <li> The second negative aspect of the product is also the drying effect of the lotion.</li>
            <li> Soaks in well, leaves skin super-soft but doesn&#x27;t leave a thick oily coat like so many deep moisturizers do (which I hate).</li>
            <li> I almost wanted to bump this down a star because of that detail.  </li>
            <li> and it went all down my leg.</li>
            <li> i typically apply before bed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It feels oddly drying on the skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a sweet smell lover</li>
            <li> My skin has been cracking lately from being so dry this winter, but this stuff has worked wonders on my hands.</li>
            <li> I use a little of this before I hit the sack at night.</li>
            <li> Then I put a little on my skin</li>
            <li> it is subtle and does not stay on the skin for too long.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it a few days now</li>
            <li> He was so nauseated by the smell that he had to open all the windows of the car.</li>
            <li> Please save yourself the trouble with this product - don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> disliked the peppermint, green tea, lavender infusion a lot.</li>
            <li> the butter does not feel overly heavy.</li>
            <li> but the product was not available.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it is made in small batches so it becomes unavailable for purchase a couple times a year!</li>
            <li> Other body butters are too greasy and are hard and grainy.</li>
            <li> I found out that I have several allergies to many products that are over the counter which is very disappointing and was beginning to get very expensive trying to find one that I could use until I found this by accident</li>
            <li> so when I read the ingredients and that it is whipped up (in small batches) it made me want to try it.</li>
            <li> I am saying this strictly on the basis of a really shady seller.  </li>
            <li> I usually usu it at nights.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just lazy and that bulky jar with the screw off</li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s typically a hard thing to find.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the product for 4 days now, twice a day and have hardly broke the surface of the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to describe how I feel about this stuff.</li>
            <li> However, the jar is too small for what it costs!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s less expensive than another moisturizer I was using.</li>
            <li> and it helped me a lot, and I thought I will shop around for a less expensive version.  </li>
            <li> Due to working outside in the elements for years on end, the skin on my hands was cracking and very painful.</li>
            <li> and it seems to get worse during the winter.</li>
            <li> Does not smell artificial or perfumy.</li>
            <li> , guys, don&#x27;t be shy!</li>
            <li> I am almost out of this and very sad that you can&#x27;t purchase anymore.</li>
            <li> and it is sooo soothing and keeps my skin from itching and painfully cracking all throughout the night</li>
            <li> &#x27; give it a try you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just recently started using this product and I must say I love it! I&#x27;m truly a natural and organic product enthusiast so when I read the ingredients and that it is whipped up (in small batches) it made me want to try it. I&#x27;ve been using it a few days now and I love the stuff it leaves my skin feeling soft and hydrated. When I first opened it I wasn&#x27;t sure how I&#x27;d like the smell, it truly smells like all the ingredients lol but the smell absorbs and leave a light scent on you in a good way. I definitely will be using this product in the future. A bit on the costly side in my opinion for body butter I&#x27;m still leaning towards splurging haha.</li>
            <li> I love it.  It has a light minty scent, but not overwhelming. And it works great as a moisturizer, I initially purchased to use as a hand cream during the dry winter months.  I will definitely purchase in the future.</li>
            <li> This body better smells so wonderful and refreshing, and is heaven on my skin. My skin has been cracking lately from being so dry this winter, but this stuff has worked wonders on my hands. Also, it feels like silky butter on my legs right after shaving. Pure heaven right there. Love the stuff! I&#x27;ve been using it every day since I got it.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!  I&#x27;m a massage therapist and I initially came to Amazon to buy some bulk shea butter and cocoa butter for mixing my own custom body products.  I saw this body butter and had to try it (along with my blocks of shea and cocoa butter).  This stuff is AMAZEBALLS!  Yes, that&#x27;s a word... look it up http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/amazeballs.  I&#x27;m super excited to see that this is made here in AUSTIN, TX and plan to stalk the maker of this fine product to see if I can get more concoctions whipped up!  :)  This would be GREAT for anyone with dry skin needing hydration.  If you&#x27;re a massage therapist like me it has a great lube without being slippery so you can get some good grip for deep tissue massage.</li>
            <li> One of the best Shea body butter I ever used it smells amazing and it makes my skin feel very smooth. It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> Not exactly what I wanted - the odor is very strong</li>
            <li> It is really good for my hands even my face I like it</li>
            <li> This product is simply AMAZING! It makes your skin feel like silk in a very natural and organic way...the scent is purely heavenly..I will undoubtedly keep this product on my shelf at all times as well as filling a smaller container to keep in my purse...you must try this...I keep ordering it....AWESOME!!!!!</li>
            <li> I love the minty smell and how soft the lotion makes my skin! Great stuff!</li>
            <li> Smells good and keep skin moisturized.</li>
            <li> The smell is amazing. It moisturizes well. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> This lotion has a nice scent.  It goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly and fully with no greasy feel.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful and feels great on!! I love it!!</li>
            <li> I am loving this product. It&#x27;s just the right consistency. Rubs into my skin with ease but keeps me moisturizered all-day. I instantly recommended it to all of my Instagram followers. It&#x27;s less expensive than another moisturizer I was using.</li>
            <li> This lotion feels great and I love knowing that it is mostly organic in ingredients.  I was not crazy about the scent.  It smells like mint flavored chocolate, which I love to eat, but not smell on my skin.</li>
            <li> Incredible fragrance - like peppermint ice cream.  My husband and I think it smells so good you could eat it.  Very moisturizing, not greasy.  Absorbs well and lasts all day.  I&#x27;ll be stocking up and buying as gifts for all my friends.  Thanks for making a clean product that actually smells great - it&#x27;s typically a hard thing to find.</li>
            <li> This was a nice splurge. The peppermint smell is refreshing, not too strong. Great for this dry late winter/early spring weather</li>
            <li> I bought this is a gift and my girlfriend just loves it.  It is so good, I use it myself as well now.  I thought that it would be a bit overpowering, but it is subtle and all the ingredients are good for your skin.  It smells SOOO good.  Thank you Better Shea Butter.  When it runs out, I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> Omg!! This body butter is AMAZING!! If I could give it 10 stars I would...the scent, the luxurious creamy feel everything is fantastic.  I found out that I have several allergies to many products that are over the counter which is very disappointing and was beginning to get very expensive trying to find one that I could use until I found this by accident and I thought why not what&#x27;s one more to try so I gave it a go and...Yay finally this is going to be my moisturizer from now on!! The best part it&#x27;s all natural..Thankyou Thankyou Thankyou &#x27;&#x27;&#x27;&#x27;&#x27; give it a try you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Love the smell! Fresh and clean only need to little bit. Beautifulfragrance</li>
            <li> I love the lotion, it is soothing and moisturizing for all day.</li>
            <li> This is not only great for my skin, but I&#x27;ve had several people tell me that I smell like cotton candy, cookies, etc.  It has a strong peppermint smell when you first put it on, but then turns into a very mellow, mild scent (which apparently to some, smells like cookies and candy).</li>
            <li> I ordered this Shea butter for the first time and I love it! I use it on my face at night and on my arms. I will order it again for sure !</li>
            <li> but the peppermint doesn&#x27;t agree with my skin. like perfume, i think that it is different on every skin. i hope to see this product with other aromas or none at all.</li>
            <li> Product came quickly, feels and smells great!</li>
            <li> This is the best body cream I have used! It consists of natural products. I just wish that I had a gallon jug of it. Then, I would feel relieved.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I even use it on my face.</li>
            <li> I love the peppermint Shea body butter! It moisturizes without leaving my skin greasy. The peppermint scent is pleasant and fades to light scent within five minutes or so. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I love this product.... It is not oily in any way. It has a very faint smell of peppermint when first applied, but after it smells more like coco. It leaves your skin soft all day...</li>
            <li> Love it! It smells great and goes on smooth not greasy. I continue to order it. Other body butters are too greasy and are hard and grainy. This is perfect!</li>
            <li> Hello, everyone.  I just would like to say avoid purchasing this product.  I am saying this strictly on the basis of a really shady seller.  I initially gave this product 5 stars because the moisturizer is pretty good.  However, in my initial review I praised it, but critiqued the product coming in a plastic jar for the price you are paying.  Call me fanatical about my health, but it was something I simply had to mention for other buyers that also like to do research like me.  There is a growing awareness &amp; indisputable evidence now that nearly all plastics (including PET) are leaching chemicals, so I try to avoid them.  These chemicals including (BPA), not only affect you but future generations in our lineage, meaning you pass this damage on down to your children.  The photo really looks like the product is in a glass jar.  It wasn&#x27;t a total deal breaker because I should have asked before buying, but I mentioned it in my review.  Well, coincidentally I started being attacked &amp; insulted by the seller under another alias or someone that the seller knows.  The timing was too coincidental for it not to have come from someone close to the seller.  At first, I got a kind response justifying why the PET jar was used, which was appreciated.  However, I felt compelled to give further evidence in order to educate the seller on my beliefs.  I kept my initial review below the starred line, so you may read.  I also encourage you to read the attacking posts.  Remember, this all came after purchasing a $17 moisturizer AND giving it 5 stars.  I think I am entitled to my opinion for a $17 moisturizer, don&#x27;t you?  I am returning this item or will be contacting Amazon for the refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***************************************************&lt;br /&gt;(Original Review)&lt;br /&gt;This product is excellent.  The ingredients are high quality &amp; moisturizes the skin great.  Don&#x27;t feel greasy or the oily discomfort like a lot of lotions may do.  I am not a big lotion guy, but I recently came back from a trip to Texas &amp; my skin was itching &amp; on fire.  I felt dried out, so I wanted to find something all natural without any chemicals or fillers.  This did the trick perfect.  It also has a nice soothing, mild buttery/peppermint aroma &amp; also gives a nice, soft peppermint tingly flare on the skin (not overpowering).  My stars go to the product itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, my only gripe is that the photos are a bit deceiving.  That is a plastic container with a metal lid, NOT GLASS.  I almost wanted to bump this down a star because of that detail.  They really should mention it in the product description, but I take part of the blame for not inquiring with the seller.  I just don&#x27;t come across a lot of clear plastic jars with METAL lids.  I don&#x27;t know, perhaps I just don&#x27;t buy many products like this.  I guess it&#x27;s a let down because I am trying to get plastic out of my life as much as possible.  Studies are now pointing to the fact that BPA is not the only culprit, but that almost ALL plastics leach some sort of endocrine disrupting chemical as well as flame retardants.  I just think to pay for an organic moisturizer at this price level from a company that puts so much effort into a healthier, all natural product begs the question &#x27;why cheapen the deal with plastic&#x27;?  Chances are, if you are like me, you research your health &amp; what you put on &amp; in your body, hence taking every measure possible to keep toxins away, so your target market will most likely fork over that extra buck for a glass container.  Once again, still an AWESOME moisturizer.  I just felt the need to let others know.  Best of health to you all ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Oh, and if you are interested in finding out more of what was mentioned above involving plastic in our lives &amp; the dangerous health effects, then I highly recommend a documentary called &#x27;Plastic Planet&#x27; by Werner Boote (can purchase it right here on Amazon ;).  Happy health to you!</li>
            <li> However, the jar is too small for what it costs! The picture had me thinking I was getting a normal sized jar, but the jar is smaller than normal. I like the product, love how it makes my skin feel, but I&#x27;m just not sure it&#x27;s worth the size.</li>
            <li> The reason I even started shopping around for an Organic Aloe Vera body cream is that I sampled similar cream at the promotional event and a jar of that cream was $30.  I have very dry hand skin and it helped me a lot, and I thought I will shop around for a less expensive version.  That&#x27;s how I came across Organic Aloe Vera and Shea Body Butter cream and I gave it a try.  And I am very happy with it - it is fresh, natural and you really need just few dabs.  I use it mostly for my hands and just after the weeks use I already see a significant difference in my skin - it is much softer, smother and much younger looking.  I also tried the cream on my feet, elbows and the entire body - it works great, leaving skin much softer.  And I love the smell - it is subtle and does not stay on the skin for too long.  Great find and I hope this cream is around for a long time as I intend to use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been using coconut oil as a body lotion, but it left my skin a bit drier feeling than I like.  This body butter is perfect.  Nice and creamy, and leaves my skin dewy but not greasy.  I wasn&#x27;t sure about the peppermint smell at first, but now I really like it; it&#x27;s very refreshing for summer.  When the product first arrived (on a very hot day), the oils and shea butter had separated somewhat, but I shook it up several times over the next few days and now it&#x27;s all blended together again -- a small price to pay for a great product with simple, effective ingredients!</li>
            <li> I did not recognize this brand but was intrigued enough by the reviews and the description to buy it. Today is the first time that I used the Better Shea Butter on both my face and body. The thing that struck me instantly was how pungent the smell of the product is - it has a positively nauseating smelling of sour milk, chocolate and peppermint. After putting on the butter, I put on a short sleeve shirt and shorts and went for a car ride with a friend. He immediately asked me why I smelled so unusual. He was so nauseated by the smell that he had to open all the windows of the car. The smell has not diminished even though it has been on a good three hours. The second negative aspect of the product is also the drying effect of the lotion. It feels uncomfortable in that it feels like it has tightened my skin (and not in a good way). It also, as the three hours wore on, has a stinging feel to it. After I write this review, I am going to jump in the shower to wash my whole body down. I will also be tossing this product in the garbage can. Please save yourself the trouble with this product - don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> Although I liked the whipped organic Shea body butter with the Aloe Vera, the smell was way to strong to use as an everyday moisturizer.  I would recommend using this only at night.</li>
            <li> Texture is wonderful -  fluffy &amp; whipped plus it absorbs quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I disliked the peppermint, green tea, lavender infusion a lot. It smelled synthetic.&lt;br /&gt;If it is available orderless or in a cleaner, simpler smell I will re order. The smell did dissipate&lt;br /&gt;within  5 to 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> It is just as advertised! I use this all over my body. All natural products are used, smells very organic, and leaves your skin feeling so soft and looking healthy. Definitely recommend. You have gained a new loyal customer.</li>
            <li> This body cream is AMAZING! It&#x27;s thick enough to give good moisture and soften but not too thick that it leaves a heavy oily coating o. Your skin. It smells sooooo good, kind of reminds me of those mint candies from Olive Garden lol. I highly recommend this to anyone, especially if you have dry skin.</li>
            <li> You only need a little bit of this to go a long way.  I don&#x27;t get the overwhelming peppermint smell that some are reporting...it was almost like a vanilla mint.  The consistency is great (not too anything - greasy, heavy, light, etc.) and after just 3 days, I can see a positive difference in my skin.  Will definitely be ordering more!</li>
            <li> Smells very earthy, which is a good thing. Does not smell artificial or perfumy. Very moisturizing. The only reason I&#x27;m rating 4 stars and not 5, is bc the peppermint scent is pretty strong (for me at least). I think this is a great company and can&#x27;t wait for them to come out with more products!</li>
            <li> Great texture and smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> I use it every day after I get out of the shower or bath. Its the perfect finishing touch to feeling clean and soft and smells so good!! When I wake up the next day my skin is still soft (not greasy at all!). I love the product!!</li>
            <li> THIS IS AWESOME:) i liked it so much i bought a second jar! It smells wonderful and it feels so luxurious on my skin! What a nice present to myself!</li>
            <li> Smell is a strange sort of musty peppermint. It works well but with the smell won&#x27;t use it anywhere but on feet and legs so I don&#x27;t have to smell it.</li>
            <li> I really like this product! It goes on easily, smells great and makes my skin feel soft and smooth. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because I wish it lasted a little longer. I have very dry skin and I noticed that halfway through the day I felt like I needed some more. But the whipped formula is great and it&#x27;s not too heavy feeling which is great</li>
            <li> i used it 2-3 times a day.</li>
            <li> You need to try this! It has a strong, but pleasant, smell of peppermint. If you don&#x27;t like that smell, that would be the only reason not to get this product. I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> This is a great moisturizer and really needed since I live in such a dry climate here in New Mexico.  It has the wonderful Shea butter moisturizing quality but is blended in such a way as to not have the characteristic &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; feel of the pure shea butter.  I love the subtle fragrance as well.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I love this Shea Body Butter!</li>
            <li> I use this product almost daily.  I have several brands and formulations of natural, shea-based butters, but I feel that this one is truly exceptional.  It absorbs quickly into the skin and has a relaxing yet uplifting scent.  I use it during the day, at night, and sometimes before yoga classes if my skin needs a little extra moisture.  I&#x27;ve even used it on my acne-prone face with no issues whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very sensitive to chemicals and scents, and the smell is in no way overpowering.  In fact, I wish it lingered a little more -it&#x27;s heavenly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am already buying this for holiday gifts, and will be re-stocking my supply soon!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product in my massage room for moisturizing body wraps. My clients love it.  It goes on nice and smooth and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy by the end of the session.  It smells great, too!</li>
            <li> This body butter is heavenly! I&#x27;ve had such dry skin this winter and it feels amazing on my hands and body. It&#x27;s the perfect amount of peppermint and the butter does not feel overly heavy. Love that it&#x27;s made with organic products!</li>
            <li> Good stuff. Very rich.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m having a love/hate relationship with this product. It did absolutely nothing for my body. I put it on after showering and my skin was still extremely dry. So I decided to use it only on my face. I like it and it makes my face soft. And my skin isn&#x27;t as oily at the end of the day. But when I first put it on, I always have to apply it twice. It&#x27;s like the first time isn&#x27;t enough, my face starts to feel tight and dry. So I put it on again and I&#x27;m good for the rest of the day. Maybe it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s winter and my skin is more prone to dryness. I feel that this will work better during the summer when my skin isn&#x27;t as dry. I&#x27;ll be purchasing again when it gets warmer.</li>
            <li> My skin felt soft and smooth without being greasy or sticky. The peppermint scent is refreshing. This was my second  purchase of this product. I love it!</li>
            <li> This product has a wonderful fragrance and the texture is very smooth. It&#x27;s non greasy and as with the peppermint infusion would be very helpful if one has arthritis. It has a cooling effect when applied.</li>
            <li> Love the texture of this cream.  however, the peppermint scent is way too overpowering.  it does die down a bit after use, but it&#x27;s still too strong to wear out. i typically apply before bed.</li>
            <li> I would give this cream 5 stars because it is very rich and luscious and feels nice on the skin, but I was very deceived by the description. It states that it&#x27;s infused with Peppermint &amp; Lavender essential oils, and yes the peppermint is very very prominent, but instead of lavender I smell a sweet creamy almost chocolatey smell. So over all the cream smells like a York Peppermint Pattie. I&#x27;m not a sweet smell lover so I will give my second one to a friend (I bought 2). If you love dessert-y smells you will love this.  I will repurchase this if there is another essential oil blend which is more natural/earthy smelling.</li>
            <li> I am almost out of this and very sad that you can&#x27;t purchase anymore. Despite the price point, the product did last a long time.</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin nice and soft not grease.  The fragrance is soothing, relaxing, calming and refreshing.  I received so many compliments so I tellike people who made the product and where they can purchase the product. I look forward to additional fragrances.</li>
            <li> The product met my expectations.  It has a good consistency, and nice fragrance.  I will re-order this product again.</li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love this product.  It feels great and smells refreshing!</li>
            <li> Smooth and soft. Very creamy and calming/cool sensation. Perfect for your skin. Will be ordering more:-)</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this cream; I bought it less than a month ago and was horribly disappointed to see that it is currently out of stock when I went to buy more.</li>
            <li> Wonderful whipped texture and fragrance.  Will buy again.  Mosturizes nicely.</li>
            <li> I was not sure about this to begin with, but my wife promised that there was nothing better for your skin than shea butter. So I jumped. I use a little of this before I hit the sack at night. Due to working outside in the elements for years on end, the skin on my hands was cracking and very painful. After 8 days of putting this on, I am noticing a huge difference in my hands, and I noticed that I have been sleeping like a baby. Well, my wife told me that peppermint oil was a natural relaxant, which makes sense. I didn&#x27;t believe in this stuff until now - I HIGHLY recommend this product. It is really, truly amazing... and it&#x27;s for you too, guys, don&#x27;t be shy!</li>
            <li> The peppermint is pretty pungent.&lt;br /&gt;The Shea butter is ok.  Not as smooth as other brands, and it separates a bit, which I accept, given this is a natural,product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels oddly drying on the skin.  I wanted to try this, as I wanted to try a new, startup vendor.  Upon receipt, I got an email asking me to comment on other proposed scents etc for products, and promising a gift of an additional product I. Return.  Which I did, giving a thoughtful  email w suggestions.  But I never got the promised product, despite several follow up emails to the vendor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So start up here might really translate to fly by night.  Like I said, the product is okay, cheaper than other 25% Shea butters! but it&#x27;s not as creamy and rich feeling either.</li>
            <li> Love this!  It smells great and is super creamy. I will definitely buy more!  The smell is not overpowering and has a gentle peppermint aroma. It leaves my skin feeling great!  This is my second purchase, and I know I will buy more.</li>
            <li> It is wonderful on my dry skin. Not as creamy as I thought it would be but it spreads very easy.</li>
            <li> I just love this product, I put in on every time I think about it, because I just LOVE the smell. The peppermint is not very strong, it has lavender and vanilla too, and it&#x27;s just great. I like how it makes my skin look like it&#x27;s sexy glowing, I put it on my collar bones and shoulders especially. It absorbs fast, great for the body. I hope they make a formula for dry hands too... my cuticles are always dry from washing all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I chose 5 stars because as a body butter, it is smooth and spreads easily, and smells good. And I am picky, sensitive to smells. The peppermint is initially a light refreshing scent, but what is left behind on your skin is more of a light vanilla scent. And the jar is nice I know that&#x27;s wierd to comment on, but I like that it&#x27;s easy to close and of great quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I look forward to more products from this company...</li>
            <li> When I opened the box, I thought , Oh No it&#x27;s such a small bottle, am I going to use this up in a week.  Then I put a little on my skin ( I have psoriasis ) and was absolutely amazed at how little I had to use to go such a long way.  I had just a dab on the end of my finger and it went all down my leg. WOW!  I&#x27;ve used the product for 4 days now, twice a day and have hardly broke the surface of the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a great product!  I also thought at first the smell was overpowering ( I&#x27;m only use to unscented products), but when I got it on my skin, it sunk in and became a natural soothing peppermint scent, very subtle and quite cool to the feel.  Amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is very dry and it keeps it moist and free from cracking, so that it doesn&#x27;t itch or hurt.  I put it on after my morning shower and it lasts all day.  Then I put it on before I sleep and it is sooo soothing and keeps my skin from itching and painfully cracking all throughout the night and I sleep like a rock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so happy I found this product.  I will buy much more!  THANKS!</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great and it feels great going on. I had never used shea butter before and so I wasn&#x27;t certain of what to expect. I have really dry hands and it seems to get worse during the winter. This helped a lot! Did I mention that it smells great?!? (If you like peppermint, of course.) :)</li>
            <li> I like this product. It works well on skin, fragrance is nice (not too minty) but not overpowering. No issues with shipping. However, I think this is either a new product for this company or one that they are testing so there have been a couple of times when I wanted to order but the product was not available. Hopefully these inventory issues will be resolved, but the product is good.</li>
            <li> Like the creamy texture and the way it makes my skin feel-very soft. I don&#x27;t like the overall smell of peppermint on my skin. Would prefer another scent like citrus (orange, lemon) or some other nice smelling scent.</li>
            <li> Silky smooth, love the light peppermint scent!</li>
            <li> Ultra moisturizing. not greasy. Quick Absorbing.  Refreshing peppermint scent.&lt;br /&gt;Has a nice whipped souffl√© texture. Will buy again. I use it on my knees, feet.</li>
            <li> I love it.  Smells minty-fresh and leaves your skin wonderfully tingly all over.  Feels so good right after a shower!  Soaks in well, leaves skin super-soft but doesn&#x27;t leave a thick oily coat like so many deep moisturizers do (which I hate).</li>
            <li> Nice product but too expensive for the size of the jar.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my order.  I love how this makes my skin feel!  It&#x27;s not greasy, and smells wonderful!  Definitely will be purchasing more.  Glad I found this.</li>
            <li> loved the peppermint shea body butter.  Fells wonderful on my dry winter skin and the peppermint  is wonderful.</li>
            <li> Unusual texture but goes on nicely, good moisturizing properties, nice smell. I will order again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to describe how I feel about this stuff. I love the smell! Soo good! It goes on smooth and not greasy but I feel like it doesn&#x27;t moisturize that well. I used it all over my body after a shower and I still had my dry prickly skin. Usually even when I use a standard lotion that goes away so I was surprised when this didn&#x27;t help. It helped but didn&#x27;t take it away completely. Even after using it a couple days in a row. I will finish the jar and see how it goes.</li>
            <li> The Peppermint Infused Body Butter is amazing. Not greasy but keeps skin moisturized all day. The fragrance is there but not too strong to be worn with a perfume.</li>
            <li> not bad i wish they could put it in bigger container</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I found this! Creamy and smooth and great scent! I&#x27;m ready to buy more! I recommend it for everyone!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally take the time to write reviews.....but this is impressive.  I even took the jar to my daughter&#x27;s for Father&#x27;s day for everyone to try and everyone loved it.  It has a slight scent of peppermint, no greasy feel, and leaves your skin feeling soft and smooth.  I&#x27;m using it on my legs and feet, and will definitely buy more when this is gone!  From Gail in Candler, NC</li>
            <li> Absolutely the BEST! Great whipped consistency and lovely luscious pepperment scent.</li>
            <li> Prouduct is very nice. Would like more lavender scent.</li>
            <li> I like this shea body butter.</li>
            <li> I love this body butter! I usually usu it at nights. And love the peppermint smell. Love all your products</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer with out all the junk! My daughter and I have a ton of allergies and both of us can use this with no problems!  Can&#x27;t wait for more of their products!!! I&#x27;ve been using for over a year and I&#x27;m definitely hooked.  My only complaint is that it is made in small batches so it becomes unavailable for purchase a couple times a year!</li>
            <li> This is one of the best body butters I have tried. I&#x27;m all into organic and watch what I put on my body. This product is the bomb!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this Shea butter lotion! It has a cool peppermint feel and smells wonderful. It&#x27;s thicker, and creamy. Took a while to receive, but it was worth the wait. I&#x27;m on my second one.</li>
            <li> I do love this stuff.  It&#x27;s light, it lasts, and it works.  The only drawback is the container.  I wish they offered something a little more portable, or something with a pump, and maybe something purse sized, while I&#x27;m suggesting. I&#x27;m just lazy and that bulky jar with the screw off top can be a deterrent to using this as much as I&#x27;d really like to.</li>
            <li> product not the same as previous orders, something has changed</li>
            <li> Love this lotion! I have suffered from dry skin for as long as I can remember. This is the first lotion that has had lasting impact and created soft skin in just a few uses! Love the peppermint scent, it reminds me of a girl scout cookie but is not too overpowering after it is absorbed.</li>
