    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>It&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
            <li>I used this product for almost 10 years with perfect results.</li>
            <li>An excellent product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a perfect product to use with my Clarisonic.  </li>
            <li>Excellent foaming cleanser - I use it to take off my make up</li>
            <li>found that it works perfectly with my Olay cleansing brush, which is the cheaper version of Clairsonic.</li>
            <li>Happy I made this purchase.</li>
            <li>great  </li>
            <li>great  </li>
            <li>great ¡</li>
            <li>Great cleanser.</li>
            <li>Great stuff</li>
            <li>and it keeps my girlfriend happy.</li>
            <li>I know many people swear by the Clinique 3-step systems, but this cleanser and the Moisture Surge Extended Thirst Relief moisturizer have been my perfect combo, evening out the inconsistent oily/dryness.</li>
            <li>This has been the best and most effective cleanser I have ever used.</li>
            <li>This was a good makeup remover, but that&#x27;s all it is- a makeup remover.</li>
            <li>Clinique always has good quality products for your skin.</li>
            <li>It rinses surprisingly well for being a silky cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do love Clinique!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love this face wash!  </li>
            <li>LOVE this for make up remover!</li>
            <li>The product was foaming and nice smelling when bought from Clinique, did not leave a residue on face as this batch.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m thrilled with this product and so glad I tried it.</li>
            <li>Dermatologist isn&#x27;t sure if this is the best product for my oily, mature skin.  </li>
            <li>I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li>I just turned 30 and most people think I&#x27;m closer to 20  </li>
            <li>Just love this product.</li>
            <li>I keep it in the shower and have used it for many years now.  </li>
            <li>but my face needs exfoliate more, and I guess this doesn&#x27;t do it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for removing makeup before a deeper cleansing or as a gentle cleanser on</li>
            <li>Love Clinque products and</li>
            <li>My favorite face wash for about 5 years running</li>
            <li>I love the foam this cleanser makes.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li>I have been on the search for the perfect cleanser for a long time.  </li>
            <li>This cleanser does as good a job with more foam, which I really like.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had incredibly oily skin my entire life.</li>
            <li>I love the way it feels, so smooth.....</li>
            <li>This has been the best $20 I have spent to solve a problem that has been ongoing for 3 years.</li>
            <li>I am using it and it seems to work fine, but</li>
            <li>Within a week of using this product I noticed a HUGE difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>¡¡  its terrific  its  great</li>
            <li>Otherwise, this stuff is fabulous by itself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It also feels free of skin.</li>
            <li>Love this facial wash definitely good for the oily T-zone</li>
            <li>Liked the sample so much, that I purchased a full size.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend this product fulfilled all my expectations in terms of quality and price is a great product I highly recommend  </li>
            <li>My skin feels so clean after.</li>
            <li>It is great for removing makeup and getting your face completely clean, and it won&#x27;t dry you out.</li>
            <li>I feel that it is worth the money to have such great results, and I will reach for this whenever my wallet allows me to.</li>
            <li>Afterwards, your face feels clean of grime.  </li>
            <li>Would reccommend to every one that needs a clean face without drying.</li>
            <li>Goes on creamy but rinces off to a squeaky clean face</li>
            <li>and I still have a good amount left in the original bottle.  </li>
            <li>I have been a long time purchaser of Clinque products, and I have to say this is by far one of their best cleansers.  </li>
            <li>love it and fast delivery</li>
            <li>I had a trial size that I found in my makeup drawer and after using it up decided to purchase the full size.  </li>
            <li>If I am ever able to afford this again, I will most definitely buy it in the store.</li>
            <li>I also have the most sensitive skin of anybody I know.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li>I love this product, but I should have ordered direct.</li>
            <li>I have a fresh feel after use</li>
            <li>I you really want your skin to feel squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>It is very gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li>Leaves my face soft and smooth</li>
            <li>While I love the entire line of face cleansing products, I believe that this cleanser does everything you want and more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>little really does go a long way, and the lather is silky and enjoyable - the longer you massage, the more it lathers, so shut off the tap and enjoy the experience!</li>
            <li>While it&#x27;s nice that a little bit goes a long way, the smell isn&#x27;t overpowering, and it gets nice and foamy</li>
            <li>Just a dab does it, and it makes my face clean without the drying action of soap.  </li>
            <li>This is the first face wash I&#x27;ve found that leaves my skin feeling satisfactorily clean, and not dry or oily.</li>
            <li>I have found that some people find the treatment harsh for sensitive skin, but for my skin type, it has just the right amount of chemicals needed to make my skin feel fresh and clean, and free of dirt, oil, and grime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I do recommend a gentle exfoliating scrub 2 times a week.</li>
            <li>I really like Clinique&#x27;s Foaming Cleanser.  </li>
            <li>Amazon is one very convenient way to keep a supply on hand.  </li>
            <li>and then I follow up with a gentle scrub exfoliator.</li>
            <li>You could possibly spend $50 at your mall&#x27;s counter and get this cleanser for free, if there is a promotion.)&lt;br</li>
            <li>I REALLY LIKE IT</li>
            <li>I really feel like my skin is cleansed of all traces of makeup.  </li>
            <li>I really like this wash.  </li>
            <li>I used other products for years and completely forgot that I really liked this one.  </li>
            <li>As another reviewer mentioned, some people may find that their skin isn&#x27;t squeaky clean if this is the ONLY product they use.</li>
            <li>would completely recommend this product, and suggest that a follow-up with their treatment plan works just as good, if not better that the Pro-Active alternative.</li>
            <li>You only need a small amount and after using, your face feels AMAZING CLEAN.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t take a star off for this because this wash treated me fabulously for so long.</li>
            <li>Its all I use and recommend highly.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for anyone struggling with acne.</li>
            <li>It only takes a small amount to work up a good lather.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s more than enough to cover my entire face, neck, and upper chest.  </li>
            <li>I test the leftover makeup and dirt with the Clinique toner, and I have noticed a significant difference between washing my face with other cleansers to removed my makeup vs. this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>There was a definate difference when product was purchased in the department stores or from Clinique directly.  </li>
            <li>Cosmetics do get old and lose their qualities.</li>
            <li>It cleans your face and leaves your skin soft.</li>
            <li>I think the product is old.</li>
            <li>There is a considerable amount of product in the tube so it lasts quite a while.  </li>
            <li>also like how I can use this cleanser without my face brush and know that my face will get significantly cleaner than when I use other facial soaps.</li>
            <li>My mom received a small 5oz of this cleanser in one of the kits given to her for free after spending a minimum amount at the Clinique counter, and she let me keep this cleanser.</li>
            <li>Your face is left soft with a non greasy feeling too!</li>
            <li>I had two of the identical foam washes sent from seller and both had same, old smelling quality.  </li>
            <li>My sensitive skin is finally tamed!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve outgrown Clinique, which is really designed for younger women, but they make terrific, simple skin care.  </li>
            <li>this stuff makes your face feel squeaky clean with a very small amount.</li>

            <li> My sensitive skin is finally tamed!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve outgrown Clinique, which is really designed for younger women, but they make terrific, simple skin care.  </li>
            <li> this stuff makes your face feel squeaky clean with a very small amount.</li>
            <li> As in, it dries my skin out SO much that I had horizontal wrinkles across my cheeks after washing from the skin pulling so tight!</li>
            <li> normally buy the Clinique face cleansing gel in the tall green bottles that come with their 3-step facial care kits, but this foaming cleanser has gone above and beyond the already-high bar I set for the brand&#x27;s gel</li>
            <li> AND IT LAST A REALLY LONG TIME</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes and washes off completely with a few splashes of water.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully I can make this last for another month, along with some of the other soaps I have.</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin, this is NOT for you.</li>
            <li> I use an oil based eye makeup remover and this takes away all the oily residue in a single lather.  </li>
            <li> AND the freakiest part, if I opened my mouth my skin was so dry it would actually pull my bottom eyelids down.</li>
            <li> I also have very sensitive skin, so it is really hard to find a product that won&#x27;t break me out.</li>
            <li> , YOU ONLY NEED A LITTLE BIT FOR YOUR FACE.</li>
            <li> It is just a tiny bit harsh.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Cuts through oil and dirt like none other.</li>
            <li> The face wash foams up well and a small amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> have had the small travel-sized cleanser for a long time, and yet it has lasted for a while.</li>
            <li> That, and the soap residue, mean that I will definitely not buy it again.</li>
            <li> Before you try any other product, give this one a try!!!</li>
            <li> I have been struggling with acne for the past 3 years.</li>

            <li> Happy I made this purchase. I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> The product sent to me was expired and had an rancid smell.  I had two of the identical foam washes sent from seller and both had same, old smelling quality.  There was a definate difference when product was purchased in the department stores or from Clinique directly.  The product was foaming and nice smelling when bought from Clinique, did not leave a residue on face as this batch.  Cosmetics do get old and lose their qualities. Please be advise when purchasing online...</li>
            <li> I have been on the search for the perfect cleanser for a long time.  This is definitely not it.  While it&#x27;s nice that a little bit goes a long way, the smell isn&#x27;t overpowering, and it gets nice and foamy, it leaves a soap residue on my face that I absolutely hate.  I am in my twenties and have oily combination skin.  The cleanser has never made me break out.  However, it totally dries out my skin in the winter.  That, and the soap residue, mean that I will definitely not buy it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had incredibly oily skin my entire life. I had problems with acne until I started using this face wash. It&#x27;s wonderful. I also have the most sensitive skin of anybody I know. No scents, no \\&quot;essential oils\\&quot;, no nothing.    I used this product for almost 10 years with perfect results. I just turned 30 and most people think I&#x27;m closer to 20  *****BUT*** If you have dry skin, this is NOT for you. I know because, unfortunately I now have dry skin :(((((  I started using a medication that dries my skin out and can NOT use this wash any longer. As in, it dries my skin out SO much that I had horizontal wrinkles across my cheeks after washing from the skin pulling so tight! AND the freakiest part, if I opened my mouth my skin was so dry it would actually pull my bottom eyelids down. Creeeeeeepy. Don&#x27;t have this problem with cream cleansers   I didn&#x27;t take a star off for this because this wash treated me fabulously for so long. I&#x27;m sad, but now having to use moisturizing cream cleansers. I thought oily skin was a pain but i want it back!!!!</li>
            <li> Love this facial wash definitely good for the oily T-zone</li>
            <li> This was a good makeup remover, but that&#x27;s all it is- a makeup remover. If you have the money then go for it, but you can get the same effect with a generic brand makeup remover cloth. I do love Clinique!</li>
            <li> I you really want your skin to feel squeaky clean. this is the only cleanser on the market that will do it. Cuts through oil and dirt like none other. My skin feels so clean after. Its all I use and recommend highly.</li>
            <li> Clinique always has good quality products for your skin. The face wash foams up well and a small amount goes a long way. Your face is left soft with a non greasy feeling too!</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product fulfilled all my expectations in terms of quality and price is a great product I highly recommend  great  great  great ¡¡¡  its terrific  its  great</li>
            <li> This is the first face wash I&#x27;ve found that leaves my skin feeling satisfactorily clean, and not dry or oily. As another reviewer mentioned, some people may find that their skin isn&#x27;t squeaky clean if this is the ONLY product they use. I do recommend a gentle exfoliating scrub 2 times a week. Otherwise, this stuff is fabulous by itself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little really does go a long way, and the lather is silky and enjoyable - the longer you massage, the more it lathers, so shut off the tap and enjoy the experience! It rinses surprisingly well for being a silky cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m thrilled with this product and so glad I tried it. I know many people swear by the Clinique 3-step systems, but this cleanser and the Moisture Surge Extended Thirst Relief moisturizer have been my perfect combo, evening out the inconsistent oily/dryness. My sensitive skin is finally tamed!</li>
            <li> Just love this product. Don&#x27;t understand why Clinique is discontinuing it.</li>
            <li> I really like Clinique&#x27;s Foaming Cleanser.  Just a dab does it, and it makes my face clean without the drying action of soap.  I think it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li> Amazon is one very convenient way to keep a supply on hand.  I keep it in the shower and have used it for many years now.  It cleans your face and leaves your skin soft.</li>
            <li> Purchased some Clinque at the department store and received a sample of this as a bonus gift.  Liked the sample so much, that I purchased a full size.  You only need a small amount and after using, your face feels AMAZING CLEAN.</li>
            <li> An excellent product.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for years. Love it!</li>
            <li> I have been using this face wash for over ten years. It is great for removing makeup and getting your face completely clean, and it won&#x27;t dry you out. I also have very sensitive skin, so it is really hard to find a product that won&#x27;t break me out.</li>
            <li> Great cleanser. Leaves my face soft and smooth</li>
            <li> Great stuff and it keeps my girlfriend happy.</li>
            <li> I love this face wash!  I have had the same bottle for almost nine months.  I use it probably twice a week and I still have a good amount left in the original bottle.  A little goes a long way.  I only need a dime size amount and it&#x27;s more than enough to cover my entire face, neck, and upper chest.  It&#x27;s a perfect product to use with my Clarisonic.  I will continue to buy this product.</li>
            <li> Excellent foaming cleanser - I use it to take off my make up and then I follow up with a gentle scrub exfoliator.</li>
            <li> Dermatologist isn&#x27;t sure if this is the best product for my oily, mature skin.  I love the way it feels, so smooth.....but my face needs exfoliate more, and I guess this doesn&#x27;t do it.</li>
            <li> My mom received a small 5oz of this cleanser in one of the kits given to her for free after spending a minimum amount at the Clinique counter, and she let me keep this cleanser. (Please check your local counter before spending $25 on the travel-sized cleanser here on Amazon! You could possibly spend $50 at your mall&#x27;s counter and get this cleanser for free, if there is a promotion.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I normally buy the Clinique face cleansing gel in the tall green bottles that come with their 3-step facial care kits, but this foaming cleanser has gone above and beyond the already-high bar I set for the brand&#x27;s gel cleansers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that it works perfectly with my Olay cleansing brush, which is the cheaper version of Clairsonic. If you have any of the electronic facial brushes, this foaming cleanser is a match made in Heaven. You only need a tiny bit of cleanser, and you can go over your face a couple times, and your face is makeup free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like how I can use this cleanser without my face brush and know that my face will get significantly cleaner than when I use other facial soaps. I test the leftover makeup and dirt with the Clinique toner, and I have noticed a significant difference between washing my face with other cleansers to removed my makeup vs. this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had the small travel-sized cleanser for a long time, and yet it has lasted for a while. I use a pea-sized drop on my face brush, and that is enough. Hopefully I can make this last for another month, along with some of the other soaps I have. If I am ever able to afford this again, I will most definitely buy it in the store. I feel that it is worth the money to have such great results, and I will reach for this whenever my wallet allows me to.</li>
            <li> I use this every evening when I get home to take off my color for the day and then follow up with my 3 step cleansing.  It is very gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li> This is not particularly good as a face cleanser, though I might use it to scour rust off metal.  It is just a tiny bit harsh.  Afterwards, your face feels clean of grime.  It also feels free of skin.</li>
            <li> I have been struggling with acne for the past 3 years. I have used about every over the counter face wash and have used prescription creams and medicines from the dermatologist. This has been the best and most effective cleanser I have ever used. It cleans your skin without over drying. Within a week of using this product I noticed a HUGE difference in my skin. No more break outs and break outs I had were healing and fading. I use this twice a day, once when I wake up and once before I go to bed. This has been the best $20 I have spent to solve a problem that has been ongoing for 3 years. I highly recommend this product for anyone struggling with acne. Before you try any other product, give this one a try!!!</li>
            <li> love it and fast delivery</li>
            <li> I have been a long time purchaser of Clinque products, and I have to say this is by far one of their best cleansers.  While I love the entire line of face cleansing products, I believe that this cleanser does everything you want and more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only does the cleanser work wonders for clearing up skin, it makes your pores look smaller by removing all blackheads for a deep cleansing shine.  I have found that some people find the treatment harsh for sensitive skin, but for my skin type, it has just the right amount of chemicals needed to make my skin feel fresh and clean, and free of dirt, oil, and grime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would completely recommend this product, and suggest that a follow-up with their treatment plan works just as good, if not better that the Pro-Active alternative.</li>
            <li> I love this product, but I should have ordered direct. I am still waiting for it to arrive 3 weeks after ordering. Five stars for Clinique, but 1 for this company.</li>
            <li> I think the product is old. The color didn&#x27;t look like what I usually buy from the department store. I am using it and it seems to work fine, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy this again and I will order from Macy&#x27;s online instead.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years. It&#x27;s great for removing makeup before a deeper cleansing or as a gentle cleanser on it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li> this stuff makes your face feel squeaky clean with a very small amount. Would reccommend to every one that needs a clean face without drying.</li>
            <li> Goes on creamy but rinces off to a squeaky clean face</li>
            <li> Love Clinque products and this is as good&lt;br /&gt;as all the Clinque products I have purchsed in the past&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> My favorite face wash for about 5 years running</li>
            <li> I USE THIS CLEANSER ALL THE TIME.  I REALLY LIKE IT AND IT LAST A REALLY LONG TIME, YOU ONLY NEED A LITTLE BIT FOR YOUR FACE.</li>
            <li> LOVE this for make up remover!</li>
            <li> I love the foam this cleanser makes.  I really feel like my skin is cleansed of all traces of makeup.  I used the hard Clinque soap for years but it&#x27;s difficult to store at my bathroom sink.  This cleanser does as good a job with more foam, which I really like.  It only takes a small amount to work up a good lather.  It doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes and washes off completely with a few splashes of water.  I have oily skin but don&#x27;t like a stronger cleanser because they leave my skin feeling parched.  This removes makeup and the oil without stripping my skin.  There is a considerable amount of product in the tube so it lasts quite a while.  I use an oil based eye makeup remover and this takes away all the oily residue in a single lather.  I used other products for years and completely forgot that I really liked this one.  I had a trial size that I found in my makeup drawer and after using it up decided to purchase the full size.  I&#x27;m glad I did.  I&#x27;ve outgrown Clinique, which is really designed for younger women, but they make terrific, simple skin care.  I need to reacquaint myself with the brand.  I give this cleanser my highest recommendation.</li>
            <li> I really like this wash.  I have a fresh feel after use &amp; I don&#x27;t need eye-makeup remover - this alone works well</li>
