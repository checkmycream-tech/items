            <li>I have purchased many so i am never without!</li>
            <li>A good fine tooth comb.</li>
            <li>Great comb, does exactly was it supposed to do.</li>
            <li>So, if you have to purchase a box  (because just about all school kids get nits/lice at one point or another), be sure to keep the comb.</li>
            <li>Comb ok, but overpriced with shipping and handling charges.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t find anything better</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure a finer grit would work just as well.</li>
            <li>Suited me better.</li>
            <li>love it would recommend</li>
            <li>I am delighted with the results, so the product is exactly what I was expecting, and I would buy the combs again.</li>
            <li>needed for my cats fine hair to remove the pet dander</li>
            <li>Just what I needed for fine details.</li>
            <li>FINE.</li>
            <li>It makes a huge difference in the way his hair looks because it lifts and grabs all his hair.</li>
            <li>so I lightly stroked the teeth across a sheet of sandpaper a few times and it worked perfectly.  </li>
            <li>Great for removing dry flakes from the scalp</li>
            <li>it wasnt as good as i thought it would be, kind of pulls hard on the hair</li>
            <li>They are good conair combs but not what I expected, and not suited for my need.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is my 2nd fine tooth comb, and all I can say is that this one is very flimsy and nowhere near as good as my original Conair comb.</li>
            <li>A COMB FINE ENOUGH TO CLEAN MY PAINT BRUSHES, AND USED IT</li>
            <li>Thanks Conair!</li>
            <li>Exactly what you&#x27;d expect.  </li>
            <li>exactly what was wanted</li>
            <li>Product is exactly what I was looking for to help alleviate the dandruff (psoriasis) from my scalp.  </li>
            <li>Works very well for dandruff for me, very reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>BECAUSE IT WASN&#x27;T QUITE STRONG ENOUGH FOR MY USE.</li>
            <li>This comb is such a hair must for my sons fine hair.</li>
            <li>Really works.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After much searching</li>
            <li>I was happy to find this as the only other place you can generally find this type of comb is in a nit/lice box.</li>
            <li>I highly praise Amazon for giving me a refund.</li>
            <li>I used to have dandruff problems once in a while, and did have it when I started the new regime.</li>
            <li>The extra fine tooth Conair groming comb I found at Family Dollar had very fine teeth on one side (dandruff  and possibly lice removal) and tines that were a little wider apart on the opposite side.</li>
            <li>I ordered this comb to  remove built up hair spray residue which collects on my hair in little tiny clumps and doesn&#x27;t wash out very easily.  </li>
            <li>Teeth are not close enough together to make much of a difference.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve completely stopped washing my hair with shampoo, or even baking soda-apple cider vinegar combo.</li>
            <li>I found on the back at the very bottom center of the card an extended product number that is not even shown in the UPC symbol.</li>
            <li>So far Family Dollar is the only place I have found that carries the alternate product.</li>
            <li>Apparently Conare has two different thumbs cardid with the same order number.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I got this for my husband because he has dandruff. He &#x27;scrapes&#x27; his scalp before shampooing periodically to loosen up dandruff and scaling. Really works. I was happy to find this as the only other place you can generally find this type of comb is in a nit/lice box. So, if you have to purchase a box  (because just about all school kids get nits/lice at one point or another), be sure to keep the comb.</li>
            <li> Comb ok, but overpriced with shipping and handling charges.</li>
            <li> just what i needed, could not find local</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd fine tooth comb, and all I can say is that this one is very flimsy and nowhere near as good as my original Conair comb.</li>
            <li> This comb is great for managing your mustache and beard, and fits nicely in my wallet!  I had been looking for one of these for years in stores.  Never thought until now to look for it online.  Thanks Conair!</li>
            <li> it wasnt as good as i thought it would be, kind of pulls hard on the hair</li>
            <li> Exactly what you&#x27;d expect.  Works very well for dandruff for me, very reasonable price.  Durable as well.</li>
            <li> Perfect for flaky spots on scalp.</li>
            <li> This comb is such a hair must for my sons fine hair. It makes a huge difference in the way his hair looks because it lifts and grabs all his hair.I have purchased many so i am never without!</li>
            <li> Thank you...Happy with purchase</li>
            <li> Does a great job for lifting dandruff.</li>
            <li> Used on my grandkids hair. Teeth are not close enough together to make much of a difference.  Gets some but leaves a lot of nits behind.</li>
            <li> just what i needed but could not find in any store. needed for my cats fine hair to remove the pet dander</li>
            <li> This comb is incredible for getting rid of dandruff and greasy hair. I&#x27;ve completely stopped washing my hair with shampoo, or even baking soda-apple cider vinegar combo. I just rinse with water and comb thoroughly with this comb. That removes a lot of grease and also spreads the oil evenly along the length of the hair. I&#x27;m a man with long hair, and my hair hasn&#x27;t been livelier ever before. I have been doing this for 3 months now, and will make this the norm. I used to have dandruff problems once in a while, and did have it when I started the new regime. But the last 3 months, I&#x27;ve not once have dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;One tip - after combing your hair, drop the comb in shampoo water. Let it sit for an hour and then scrub the residues off with a toothbrush. That prevents removed grease from getting back on to your hair.</li>
            <li> I found the teeth were too sharp and uncomfortably scratchy on the scalp.  Couldn&#x27;t find anything better so I lightly stroked the teeth across a sheet of sandpaper a few times and it worked perfectly.  What I had on hand was 120 grit but I&#x27;m sure a finer grit would work just as well.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed for fine details.</li>
            <li> Great for removing dry flakes from the scalp</li>
            <li> COULD NOT FINE A COMB FINE ENOUGH TO CLEAN MY PAINT BRUSHES, AND USED IT AND IT WORKS FINE. I GAVE IT A 4 ONLY BECAUSE IT WASN&#x27;T QUITE STRONG ENOUGH FOR MY USE.</li>
            <li> Did not get the product I expected. The extra fine tooth Conair groming comb I found at Family Dollar had very fine teeth on one side (dandruff  and possibly lice removal) and tines that were a little wider apart on the opposite side. Conair uses  the same nomenclature for both combs  . Suited me better. The comb I got from Amazon had the same type of teeth on both sides, and the body was narrower. They are good conair combs but not what I expected, and not suited for my need.&lt;br /&gt;After much searching I did find the answer to this mix-up. It is neither my fault or Amazon&#x27;s fault. Apparently Conare has two different thumbs cardid with the same order number. Number 93593. I found on the back at the very bottom center of the card an extended product number that is not even shown in the UPC symbol. That number is 93593- 320A or 93593- 320 B. So far Family Dollar is the only place I have found that carries the alternate product. I highly praise Amazon for giving me a refund. I did not specifically aske for a refund, and if you look at the beginning of this paragraph you&#x27;ll see that I said that the product was a perfectly good comb. Thank you Amazon. I will continue to purchase from you you guys are great.</li>
            <li> I ordered this comb to  remove built up hair spray residue which collects on my hair in little tiny clumps and doesn&#x27;t wash out very easily.  Does the trick!!</li>
            <li> A good fine tooth comb.</li>
            <li> Great comb, does exactly was it supposed to do. Good for remove danduff  flakes from the scalp when hair is wet.</li>
            <li> exactly what was wanted</li>
            <li> Product is exactly what I was looking for to help alleviate the dandruff (psoriasis) from my scalp.  I am delighted with the results, so the product is exactly what I was expecting, and I would buy the combs again.</li>
