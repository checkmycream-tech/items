    <ol>
            <li>Best wax out there.</li>
            <li>It did an excellent job.</li>
            <li>Perfect</li>
            <li>This is the best leg wax on the market, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>These wax strips are excellent.  </li>
            <li>but as I said will still have to do follow-up as it is not going to work perfectly.  </li>
            <li>That is why I love them so!!!!!  </li>
            <li>and it is brilliant)</li>
            <li>/&gt;The structure  of these strips isn&#x27;t  ideal either.</li>
            <li>After shaving my legs this oil works great and has no smell/harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li>This is great, good price and shows up at my front door when needed.</li>
            <li>Waxing your own legs hurts like a mo fo and the results weren&#x27;t that great.</li>
            <li>Good</li>
            <li>Use a hair dryer to warm the wax and you are good to go.  </li>
            <li>They work amazingly well.</li>
            <li>I am giving 3 stars because the product is effective but I am not buying it again.</li>
            <li>Was effective in removing hairs from leg.</li>
            <li>Parissa is the best and works very well.</li>
            <li>Undoubtedly, I warm them up</li>
            <li>/&gt;These have not been as effective on my underarm hair, however.  </li>
            <li>This was not that effective on my lower, shin leg hair either.  </li>
            <li>For me the best method for my legs is to use a jarred wax for the main hair</li>
            <li>These strips are very easy to use.</li>
            <li>I have been using them for years, and I get better results on my own than I would at the salon.  </li>
            <li>It also is not the most effective self-waxer I have used, the warm wax was better.</li>
            <li>I have tried many wax strips and home waxes and these are the best strips by far (also the easiest to use).  </li>
            <li>Love em, tried others, but there are my favorites.</li>
            <li>I love these strips.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not so sure about this product.  </li>
            <li>I then tried it on my face, and it seemed to work better on my face.  </li>
            <li>I think you would be better off with sugaring than with this</li>
            <li>They hurt a LOT to pull off and leave a sticky resin on your skin without pulling off most of the hair.</li>
            <li>Love this brand and couldn&#x27;t find it in NC when I moved here.  </li>
            <li>and I pull the strips off leaving both wax and hair on my legs.  :-)  </li>
            <li>I love not having to make an appointment etc at the salon- that I can do the wax job anytime in the privacy of my bathroom.  </li>
            <li>They were ok, got some hair, not all.  </li>
            <li>and they did the job like magic.  </li>
            <li>Overall I was very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li>These are my favorite strips for waxing my legs and eye brows.</li>
            <li>They got most of the hair off</li>
            <li>LOVE these.  </li>
            <li>Quick easy and good.</li>
            <li>I liked the idea someone mentioned of using dryer to heat up the wax - super useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are of a good size, and an overall good quality.</li>
            <li>I was very surprised at how great the results were.  </li>
            <li>Very good product overall.  </li>
            <li>Fresh and effective.</li>
            <li>really aren&#x27;t quite as good as a quality melted wax.</li>
            <li>However, it is very easy to use and quick as well.</li>
            <li>Make sure you warm them up good by rubbing between your hands and smooth them on with the direction of hair growth, then just pull off the opposite way and you can see all your hairs on the strip-GONE!  </li>
            <li>These strips are great for areas that you can&#x27;t access very well with the jarred wax - for instance, I find I can&#x27;t get the back of my legs or my underarms very well using jarred wax, but these are perfect for hitting those areas.  </li>
            <li>got these strips, hoping it would be easy.</li>
            <li>They seem easy, but not for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to use, clean job, my favorite brand</li>
            <li>I find it to be really effective and fast!    </li>
            <li>I have been getting my bikini area waxed professionally for 25 years and am thrilled to find a product that rivals salon results!  </li>
            <li>I have tried many different hair removal products and waxes, this is by far the best</li>
            <li>, this and moom was are the only 2 waxes I will endorse because they are great at removing hair.  </li>
            <li>I am still smooth and hair free almost a month</li>
            <li>I have used similar products successfully.</li>
            <li>quick, easy, effective and not messy</li>
            <li>Still nothing better than true hot wax.</li>
            <li>This box had more large strips, but they did not remove the hair...at all.</li>
            <li>Still not as good as the Nair strips were at removing short hairs.</li>
            <li>This product worked great, with the help of two close friends, i used 2 boxes to effectively remove hair from my entire back.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I think this is a good product.</li>
            <li>Since I had such a good experience on my arms</li>
            <li>It never gets everything, but it gets more than other brands have, and as I&#x27;ve gotten more practiced at using them I get better results.</li>
            <li>I started using the Parissa strips for the face a few months ago (loved them!)</li>
            <li>It is quick to use</li>
            <li>/&gt;the wax in these strips is very strong so if you have fine hair, or not a lot, you will feel your skin being pulled, but the strip will be left free of hair, which is why we put ourselves through this torture in the first place...</li>
            <li>This product really works!!</li>
            <li>I love these strips, although I find them less effective than using the jarred wax.</li>
            <li>had the results been worth it</li>
            <li>These wax strips not nearly as messy as the Parissa warm wax, however, it is still very sticky and requires the oil to remove it.  </li>
            <li>wax does not wipe clean, but it does include a vial of the oil which will help remove left over wax :)</li>
            <li>I wanted more large strips than what was included in the Sally Hensen wax strips that were available at my local CVS.</li>
            <li>But they are a hundred times more convenient, especially for quick touch-ups.</li>
            <li>I used it on my legs, and it did not get very much hair removed.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Overall, satisfied.</li>
            <li>(I received my order within a reasonable amount of time) from this vendor!</li>
            <li>First it works.</li>
            <li>These were the first wax strips I have ever tried.</li>
            <li>I should also mention this is the first time I have waxed all together.</li>
            <li>I tried the strips first on my arms, and everything went really well!</li>
            <li>Remember to read and Follow the directions exactly for best results: warm up the strip, press down in the direction of hair growth, pull back in the opposite direction while keeping the strip parallel to your leg (or other area) and try to hold the skin taught so that the strip pulls out the hair effectively.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used several of these pre-waxed things, and this is my favorite because there isn&#x27;t too much wax on the strips</li>
            <li>That said, THESE ARE AWESOME - at least on hair above the knees.  </li>
            <li>but it would be more pricey in the long run and strips</li>
            <li>Very quick with oil included for that pesky wax left on your skin and saves time and money going to a salon.</li>
            <li>These are much like the Sally Hansen strips, pre-waxed on plastic sheets.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d been left with completely smooth skin.  </li>
            <li>(Veet uses much thicker wax).</li>
            <li>just after I applied it to my skin (but before I pulled it off) works very well.  </li>
            <li>Although I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the &amp;#34;disposable&amp;#34; aspect of these, if you&#x27;re not waxing too many times during the year these are totally worth it.</li>
            <li>These work better than any other product I have used.</li>
            <li>Took two full boxes to completely remove the hair, and some pieces were reused on \\&quot;fade-in\\&quot; areas near my butt and arms, etc</li>
            <li>Used other brands in the past and these are by far the best.  </li>
            <li>and I prefer the sturdier plastic liner to the less durable, more wrinkle prone paper ones.</li>
            <li>I did get better at using them on my 2nd and 3rd try.</li>
            <li>My theory, for what it&#x27;s worth, is that these work really well on &amp;#34;virgin&amp;#34; hair - that which is not shaved daily.  </li>
            <li>I find them less effective than using jarred wax and strips, as the jarred wax tends to take off more hair in less strips, and sometimes I have to go back a day later to clean up stray hairs that these strips miss.</li>
            <li>I have a high pain tolerance.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>The strips are easy to use (warm them between your palms for a few seconds) , mess-free, work really well and hurt far less than the professional job.  </li>
            <li>I only know that they did absolutely work as advertised.      </li>
            <li>Much neater and quicker than traditional waxing.</li>
            <li>I think as far as pre-waxed strips go these work well.</li>
            <li>also, found out, for my personal use that using sugar water saluable  is much easier.</li>
            <li>The pieces are sort of small, so it really does not cover very much on your legs.  </li>
            <li>These didn&#x27;t work that well for my leg hair, I had to repeatedly go over the same spot to get all of the hair which left my skin really irritated.</li>
            <li>Parissa has the only home waxing products that both work and are not messy.  </li>
            <li>Still, I will definitely buy these strips until I can afford getting professionally waxed on a regular basis.</li>
            <li>The strips in this product are also large enough to do the job unlike other brands.</li>

            <li> The strips are easy to use (warm them between your palms for a few seconds) , mess-free, work really well and hurt far less than the professional job.  </li>
            <li> I only know that they did absolutely work as advertised.      </li>
            <li> Much neater and quicker than traditional waxing.</li>
            <li> I think as far as pre-waxed strips go these work well.</li>
            <li> also, found out, for my personal use that using sugar water saluable  is much easier.</li>
            <li> The pieces are sort of small, so it really does not cover very much on your legs.  </li>
            <li> These didn&#x27;t work that well for my leg hair, I had to repeatedly go over the same spot to get all of the hair which left my skin really irritated.</li>
            <li> Parissa has the only home waxing products that both work and are not messy.  </li>
            <li> Still, I will definitely buy these strips until I can afford getting professionally waxed on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> The strips in this product are also large enough to do the job unlike other brands.</li>
            <li> Instead, there were still some stubble left, even after following the direction to wait until my hair was long enough and to pull the skin taught before ripping off the wax strip.  </li>
            <li> This product is much better than the SH, though - doesn&#x27;t leave such a sticky mess behind.</li>
            <li> so there was not to be an abrupt line where hair suddenly meets bare skin.      </li>
            <li> This is probably a great product, its the only product of this nature I have ever used, but i hated it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried waiting a few days and re-waxing several times, but the results have not improved thus far.  </li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this product (although you can get it cheaper on other websites).  </li>
            <li> Having it on plastic, rather a cloth makes it a little more difficult to rub effectly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> They are easy to use and because of the thin layer of wax hurt less than other wax I have used.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure why I had such a different experience with my legs</li>
            <li> but there were still a lot of little ones left.</li>
            <li> Ordered online in the past and got older box that had dried up.</li>
            <li> Have used these all over the body with no real issues.</li>
            <li> I tried them in a few different areas on my legs and warmed them by friction with my hands, and even used the blow dryer as well.</li>
            <li> I have tried several others and was very frustrated because they did not remove the hair effectively.</li>
            <li> removal(I use a professional salon brand called Green Pine with a salon wax warmer) and then, when the inevitable missed or broken hairs pop through a week later, I zip them off with a few of these wax strips.  </li>
            <li> Sticks less where it shouldn&#x27;t than other strips.    </li>
            <li> So it was definitely not worth the pain.</li>
            <li> I put it in the microwave for 20 seconds, as rubbing it between your hands does not warm it up enough.  </li>
            <li> completely not worth the money ...not to mention the lying</li>
            <li> I cut them down to the sizes I needed depending on the area.  </li>
            <li> Very little wax was left behind on my skin; for the little that was left, I purchased a separate wax remover at the drug store.</li>
            <li> it is less messy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It hurts, never gets all the hair, and leaves you a goopy mess.  </li>
            <li> So sad that my longtime favorite Nair cold wax strips were discontinued.</li>
            <li> The wax was far too thin to remove any noticeable amounts of hair, basically useless and a total waste of my money.</li>
            <li> It is a waste of money because it did not remove all the hair, and i will also have to shave.</li>
            <li> Left a few hairs behind but nothing I couldn&#x27;t tweeze</li>
            <li> Little aftermath to deal with!</li>
            <li> I dont usually mind getting my legs waxed... by SOMEONE ELSE.</li>
            <li> They removed hardly anything and gave me a rash even after using the oil provided.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t remove hardly any of my shin leg hair with these.</li>
            <li> I have had really bad luck with wax strips in the past, and waxing in general.  </li>
            <li> These strips leave very little wax on your skin!  </li>
            <li> I tried purchasing less expensive competitive products in the store that did not work.</li>
            <li> The wax layer is so thin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to waxing, and a lot of the time, frequency is what makes it less painful.</li>
            <li> It has become increasingly difficult to find in the stores</li>
            <li> Might just be me but using those waxing stripes are difficult and no hair removal happens.</li>
            <li> I forgot how painful it is.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s that painful.  </li>
            <li> but these strips were painful</li>
            <li> All the hair came off and it wasn&#x27;t painful at all.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not buying it again as they are painful!</li>
            <li> It was also excruciatingly painful.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> So sad that my longtime favorite Nair cold wax strips were discontinued. They were sold pre-waxed on fabric-like strips. These are much like the Sally Hansen strips, pre-waxed on plastic sheets. This product is much better than the SH, though - doesn&#x27;t leave such a sticky mess behind. Still not as good as the Nair strips were at removing short hairs. Have used these all over the body with no real issues.</li>
            <li> I chose this brand because no heating is required and a bottle of azulene oil is included that&#x27;s supposed to soothe irritated skin.  It&#x27;s been awhile since I last waxed, so I forgot how painful it is.  I had to psyche myself out each time I ripped the wax strip off my skin.  It&#x27;s that painful.  The azulene oil didn&#x27;t help either.  It just moisturized, but didn&#x27;t help with the stinging at all.    I would&#x27;ve endured the pain had the results been worth it and I&#x27;d been left with completely smooth skin.  Instead, there were still some stubble left, even after following the direction to wait until my hair was long enough and to pull the skin taught before ripping off the wax strip.  So it was definitely not worth the pain.</li>
            <li> These wax strips are terrific, I cut them smaller to use on my chin/lip/brows and they work terrific.  Make sure you warm them up good by rubbing between your hands and smooth them on with the direction of hair growth, then just pull off the opposite way and you can see all your hairs on the strip-GONE!  Love em, tried others, but there are my favorites.</li>
            <li> I love these strips, although I find them less effective than using the jarred wax. These strips are great for areas that you can&#x27;t access very well with the jarred wax - for instance, I find I can&#x27;t get the back of my legs or my underarms very well using jarred wax, but these are perfect for hitting those areas.  I find them less effective than using jarred wax and strips, as the jarred wax tends to take off more hair in less strips, and sometimes I have to go back a day later to clean up stray hairs that these strips miss. Still, I will definitely buy these strips until I can afford getting professionally waxed on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> I have course leg hair and this product did nothing to eliminate it. I am a quality auditor so I know how to follow directions to a T. The wax layer is so thin. I even took the advice of another user and warmed the strips with a hair dryer. I will give it one star for the Azulene oil sample included. After shaving my legs this oil works great and has no smell/harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> This is probably a great product, its the only product of this nature I have ever used, but i hated it. I have a high pain tolerance. I dont usually mind getting my legs waxed... by SOMEONE ELSE. Waxing your own legs hurts like a mo fo and the results weren&#x27;t that great. Probably do to user error. Try it though. see for yourself.</li>
            <li> Best wax out there. Ordered online in the past and got older box that had dried up. Not the case here. Fresh and effective. Thanks!</li>
            <li> The wax was far too thin to remove any noticeable amounts of hair, basically useless and a total waste of my money. I only ordered this brand because I couldn&#x27;t find the Veet brand I had always used (Veet uses much thicker wax). I&#x27;ve now found Veet on Amazon and will be using that instead.</li>
            <li> Parissa has the only home waxing products that both work and are not messy.  I have been using them for years, and I get better results on my own than I would at the salon.  I do my legs and bikini area.</li>
            <li> This product worked great, with the help of two close friends, i used 2 boxes to effectively remove hair from my entire back.  My back was not TOO hairy for a guy, but had moderate hair coverage overall.  Took two full boxes to completely remove the hair, and some pieces were reused on \\&quot;fade-in\\&quot; areas near my butt and arms, etc so there was not to be an abrupt line where hair suddenly meets bare skin.      I have seen similar products for around 6 bucks/box of 30 at the local grocery store, and I&#x27;ll be trying them next time.  I&#x27;ve never used wax strips before so i have no basis of comparison.  I only know that they did absolutely work as advertised.      Overall, satisfied.</li>
            <li> I have tried many wax strips and home waxes and these are the best strips by far (also the easiest to use).  For me the best method for my legs is to use a jarred wax for the main hair removal(I use a professional salon brand called Green Pine with a salon wax warmer) and then, when the inevitable missed or broken hairs pop through a week later, I zip them off with a few of these wax strips.  You could use the strips for everything but it would be more pricey in the long run and strips really aren&#x27;t quite as good as a quality melted wax. But they are a hundred times more convenient, especially for quick touch-ups.</li>
            <li> This product really works!! I&#x27;ve been using it for years.  It has become increasingly difficult to find in the stores so I recommend that you order it (I received my order within a reasonable amount of time) from this vendor!</li>
            <li> I love these strips. They work amazingly well. Although I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the &amp;#34;disposable&amp;#34; aspect of these, if you&#x27;re not waxing too many times during the year these are totally worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not so sure about this product.  I used it on my legs, and it did not get very much hair removed.  I then tried it on my face, and it seemed to work better on my face.  The pieces are sort of small, so it really does not cover very much on your legs.  I also tried it on my underarms, and it did not work at all.  I think I would use this again only on my face, but not on my legs, and definitely not on my underarms.  I put it in the microwave for 20 seconds, as rubbing it between your hands does not warm it up enough.  It is not a product that I would fully endorse anyone to use.</li>
            <li> Very good product overall.  Sticks less where it shouldn&#x27;t than other strips.    One recommendation that works well for me.  Instead of warming the strip in your hand, use a hairdryer.  I find it to be really effective and fast!    Not a lot of pain while using the strips, but I&#x27;m used to waxing, and a lot of the time, frequency is what makes it less painful.</li>
            <li> It did an excellent job. Left a few hairs behind but nothing I couldn&#x27;t tweeze I would highly recommend.  Perfect</li>
            <li> I am giving 3 stars because the product is effective but I am not buying it again. First it works. Was effective in removing hairs from leg. I liked the idea someone mentioned of using dryer to heat up the wax - super useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not buying it again as they are painful! I have been waxing for years now so I am used to pain &amp; know how to use this (I have a wax warmer and it is brilliant) but these strips were painful so I am giving it a 3 star. I personally prefer muslin cloth so that could be the reason.</li>
            <li> This is the best leg wax on the market, in my opinion. I have tried several others and was very frustrated because they did not remove the hair effectively. I had to keep going over the same spot repeatedly. The strips in this product are also large enough to do the job unlike other brands.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different hair removal products and waxes, this is by far the best</li>
            <li> These didn&#x27;t work that well for my leg hair, I had to repeatedly go over the same spot to get all of the hair which left my skin really irritated. If you&#x27;re looking to wax at home I think you would be better off with sugaring than with this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several of these pre-waxed things, and this is my favorite because there isn&#x27;t too much wax on the strips and I prefer the sturdier plastic liner to the less durable, more wrinkle prone paper ones. It never gets everything, but it gets more than other brands have, and as I&#x27;ve gotten more practiced at using them I get better results.</li>
            <li> I tried purchasing less expensive competitive products in the store that did not work. Parissa is the best and works very well. Much neater and quicker than traditional waxing.</li>
            <li> These DO NOT WORK. They hurt a LOT to pull off and leave a sticky resin on your skin without pulling off most of the hair. DO NOT BUY!</li>
            <li> These wax strips are excellent.  They are easy to use and because of the thin layer of wax hurt less than other wax I have used.  Try them!</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this product (although you can get it cheaper on other websites).  I have been using parissa strips for a while now, this and moom was are the only 2 waxes I will endorse because they are great at removing hair.  **and I&#x27;ve got a lot of it to remove&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;anyway, if you want to remove hair efficiently this is what you want, the strips are pre-made so it is less messy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the wax in these strips is very strong so if you have fine hair, or not a lot, you will feel your skin being pulled, but the strip will be left free of hair, which is why we put ourselves through this torture in the first place...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this wax does not wipe clean, but it does include a vial of the oil which will help remove left over wax :)</li>
            <li> Love this brand and couldn&#x27;t find it in NC when I moved here.  This is great, good price and shows up at my front door when needed.</li>
            <li> These wax strips not nearly as messy as the Parissa warm wax, however, it is still very sticky and requires the oil to remove it.  It also is not the most effective self-waxer I have used, the warm wax was better. However, it is very easy to use and quick as well.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work...left sticky residue and only pulled some hair out.</li>
            <li> Overall, I think this is a good product. But for me they are tricky to use. Undoubtedly, I warm them up and I pull the strips off leaving both wax and hair on my legs.  :-)  I did get better at using them on my 2nd and 3rd try. I think as far as pre-waxed strips go these work well. However, be prepared to practice a bit if you&#x27;ve never done this and be patient. One reviewer recommended using a hair dryer (thank you!) and I&#x27;m going to give that a try versus warming up with your hands.</li>
            <li> If you like stripes, get it. I found these wax stripes to be efficient. They are of a good size, and an overall good quality.</li>
            <li> These work better than any other product I have used. Quick easy and good.</li>
            <li> I started using the Parissa strips for the face a few months ago (loved them!) and just recently tried them for legs and bikini areas.  I have been getting my bikini area waxed professionally for 25 years and am thrilled to find a product that rivals salon results!  The strips are easy to use (warm them between your palms for a few seconds) , mess-free, work really well and hurt far less than the professional job.  I love not having to make an appointment etc at the salon- that I can do the wax job anytime in the privacy of my bathroom.  I was very surprised at how great the results were.  Remember to read and Follow the directions exactly for best results: warm up the strip, press down in the direction of hair growth, pull back in the opposite direction while keeping the strip parallel to your leg (or other area) and try to hold the skin taught so that the strip pulls out the hair effectively.  I also found that &#x27;re-warming&#x27; the strip just after I applied it to my skin (but before I pulled it off) works very well.  Very little wax was left behind on my skin; for the little that was left, I purchased a separate wax remover at the drug store.</li>
            <li> Good but does not remove hair in  one application.</li>
            <li> quick, easy, effective and not messy</li>
            <li> Does not matter what I do, i still have to use rasor after all. No, I do not like this product.</li>
            <li> They were ok, got some hair, not all.  It is quick to use but as I said will still have to do follow-up as it is not going to work perfectly.  Still nothing better than true hot wax.</li>
            <li> I was dissatisfied with these. They removed hardly anything and gave me a rash even after using the oil provided. I tried them in a few different areas on my legs and warmed them by friction with my hands, and even used the blow dryer as well. These are not for me.</li>
            <li> Might just be me but using those waxing stripes are difficult and no hair removal happens. Would not recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> I wanted more large strips than what was included in the Sally Hensen wax strips that were available at my local CVS. This box had more large strips, but they did not remove the hair...at all. The hair in my underarms and on my legs didn&#x27;t budge. I have used similar products successfully.</li>
            <li> I have had really bad luck with wax strips in the past, and waxing in general.  It hurts, never gets all the hair, and leaves you a goopy mess.  That said, THESE ARE AWESOME - at least on hair above the knees.  I used this size for my bikini line and upper legs and they did the job like magic.  Now you see the hair; now you don&#x27;t!  I cut them down to the sizes I needed depending on the area.  I am still smooth and hair free almost a month later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These have not been as effective on my underarm hair, however.  I grew the hair out to the recommended length, followed all directions again, but this only removed about 50% of the hair.  I&#x27;ve tried waiting a few days and re-waxing several times, but the results have not improved thus far.  This was not that effective on my lower, shin leg hair either.  My theory, for what it&#x27;s worth, is that these work really well on &amp;#34;virgin&amp;#34; hair - that which is not shaved daily.  On tougher hair follicles/skin that is shaved daily or nearly daily, it just can&#x27;t grab onto that hair as well and/or doesn&#x27;t have the strength to pull the follicle out.  I couldn&#x27;t remove hardly any of my shin leg hair with these.</li>
            <li> I am using my brothers account.&lt;br /&gt;I got these strips, hoping it would be easy. They seem easy, but not for me.&lt;br /&gt;The structure  of these strips isn&#x27;t  ideal either. Having it on plastic, rather a cloth makes it a little more difficult to rub effectly.&lt;br /&gt;I also, found out, for my personal use that using sugar water saluable  is much easier. These strips are not water saluable and you get everything sticky.</li>
            <li> These were the first wax strips I have ever tried. I should also mention this is the first time I have waxed all together. I tried the strips first on my arms, and everything went really well! All the hair came off and it wasn&#x27;t painful at all. Since I had such a good experience on my arms I thought I would try my legs. It did not work as well on my leg hair. I am guessing because it is coarser than my arm hair. It was also excruciatingly painful. I am not sure why I had such a different experience with my legs but I will not be using this product again for my legs. I would, however, recommend it for lighter hair - such as arm hair. Overall I was very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> These are my favorite strips for waxing my legs and eye brows. Been using them for years.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, clean job, my favorite brand</li>
            <li> These strips are very easy to use. I use them for the upper lip. Very quick with oil included for that pesky wax left on your skin and saves time and money going to a salon.</li>
            <li> this packet say &amp;#34;16 strips&amp;#34; and also&amp;#34; bonus pack with 25% more&amp;#34;, while inside it only had 10 strips. It is a waste of money because it did not remove all the hair, and i will also have to shave. completely not worth the money ...not to mention the lying, i don&#x27;t know what to do about.</li>
            <li> They sort of worked. They got most of the hair off but there were still a lot of little ones left. I bought two boxes but I actually needed three or four to fully wax both of my legs. At that point it is cheaper and easier just to shave.</li>
            <li> LOVE these.  Used other brands in the past and these are by far the best.  Use a hair dryer to warm the wax and you are good to go.  These strips leave very little wax on your skin!  That is why I love them so!!!!!  Little aftermath to deal with!</li>
