            <li>/&gt;The scent isn&#x27;t great (it smells like rubber--like the name)</li>
            <li>lol</li>
            <li>This is great.</li>
            <li>but once it is on your hair, it works great and holds all day.  </li>
            <li>I have used everything from clay, pomades, and waxes, but nothing comes close to this great product.</li>
            <li>A great product for all the spiky haired guys out there.  </li>

            <li>This stuff is great.</li>
            <li>Great for spiking up short/medium hair.</li>
            <li>It is incredible how good these products are if you use them</li>
            <li>This is actually a great hair product.  </li>
            <li>smell is great.</li>
            <li>Great hold</li>
            <li>This spiky edge hair wax is great for those people have shorter hair and looking for maximum hold.</li>

            <li>Also a great price,</li>
            <li>I bought it because of the great reviews but it did not wowed me as others have described.</li>
            <li>Great buy.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Mandom Gatsby Moving Rubber Spiky Edge is a great product.</li>
            <li>Been using it for 2 years, works great.</li>
            <li>This is  a great product.</li>
            <li>Works great and smell great.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s a great hold without it making it feel like glue.</li>
            <li>love every drop of these moving rubber!!</li>
            <li>This is also a very popular product in Japan.</li>
            <li>DID IT WORK AMAZINGLY!</li>

            <li>Magically, my hair looks great!</li>
            <li>Best stuff to use for my hair, holds for most of the day</li>
            <li>your hair will just have a mind of its own, plus because of the thickness of the hair the wax can&#x27;t hold on and will just separate and look like you&#x27;ve never applied any at all!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Axe hair wax, Got2b wax, and many more, but nothing compared to this one!!!!</li>
            <li>It still works but it wasn&#x27;t pleasant.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried about a half-dozen products before this one, and this stuff is easily the best.</li>
            <li>I have used all the clays (best for fine hair) and nothing has this hold power and its not a clay.</li>
            <li>Oh, and it smells good - like apples or something.</li>
            <li>They also smell good.</li>
            <li>And good service.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll be good to go :</li>
            <li>The Good</li>
            <li>Smells good.</li>
            <li>Malleable/Pliable is a good way to explain it.   </li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>It smells good and maintains your look all day</li>
            <li>l. Gatsby spiky edge gives a good hold but ni sticky feeling I can put my hands through it.</li>
            <li>This product is really good.</li>
            <li>Dissolves homogeneously, good quality and hold.</li>
            <li>I always loved the moving rubber series.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does not have good hold at all.&lt;br /&gt;Gave</li>
            <li>The packaging is nice and it smells great too.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for something to give your hair a nice hold, this is a great</li>
            <li>If you style your hair  up then this is a good product for you.</li>
            <li>worked good for the look i wanted...</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m good.</li>
            <li>This product is good</li>
            <li>Product is a good choice.</li>
            <li>Good product and hold my hair well.</li>
            <li>Ita a prett good product</li>
            <li>It has a really good hold</li>
            <li>it smells so good</li>
            <li>it smells so good and looks like lotion until you put it on your hands and than it because</li>
            <li>When I use this with the right amount, my hair looks product-free (which is great) but it doesn&#x27;t hold perfectly.</li>
            <li>The price point is excellent because most of the products that I have used are 2 to 3 times more.  </li>
            <li>The hold is great better than got2b glued, why although got2b glued gives mw the desired look it gets sticky after a while</li>
            <li>very pleased thank you</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I am very pleased with the product</li>
            <li>I used one more application and it spikes my hair up great.  </li>
            <li>I love this wax, it works great on my hair.</li>
            <li>Smells great by the way, not too strong but the smell lingers in a good way.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve tried so many products before!</li>
            <li>I love this!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>The best thing is to use condtioner first then shampoo to lubricate the hair to get it out</li>
            <li>, that&#x27;s how you can improve your chances of getting the most out of this nice product!&lt;br /&gt;great job!</li>
            <li>Definitely glad I bought it!</li>
            <li>That is pretty impressive technology in my book.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>make sure you close the container!</li>
            <li>and i absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>This product is strong, matte, lasts all day, and smells great (like apples).</li>
            <li>Without a doubt, this has strong hold and rlly great for short-medium hair.</li>
            <li>Very unique product!</li>
            <li>Great product, light not &#x27;tacky&#x27; so it is not stuck on your fingers.  </li>
            <li>Now that is another AMAZING thing.</li>
            <li>and it holds amazingly throughout the day.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>I use &#x27;ECO Styler&#x27; Great gel,at  $4 for a huge jar that lasts me like 1 to 2 yrs.</li>
            <li>The hold it amazing.</li>
            <li>this product is amazing.  </li>
            <li>For three years, I&#x27;ve been using this amazing wax to style my hair.  </li>
            <li>so if your hair is like mine where it seems to want to do its own thing, then grab this color and take a pass on the purple one..  </li>
            <li>good smell and ok to use it</li>
            <li>/&gt;It smells really nice</li>
            <li>Honestly I was wondering whether or not to buy this item.</li>
            <li>I was expecting it to be better since it has many great reviews.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair nice and in place</li>
            <li>It smells nice.</li>
            <li>Really nice.</li>
            <li>kind of helps it be wasted/used faster.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li>I thought I liked this product until I started noticing it flaking after a bit of manipulation.</li>
            <li>This product does have nice hold, but the flaking is a turn off to the product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Holds for a while and leaves  nice glossy finish.</li>
            <li>best part is there is so much in there that you can use this for months without having to worry about it running out.  </li>
            <li>This is great for my short wavy hair, it keeps it in place wonderfully.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like a good trainer for your hair :)</li>
            <li>Works great on short hair, excellent hold, no flaking.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not that effective</li>
            <li>It holds up your hair nicely.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does smell nice, though.</li>
            <li>It is as nice as looks on the picture.</li>
            <li>Good hold through out the day and a very cool</li>
            <li>This product is great if you need super hold.</li>
            <li>It smells good and easy to wash out.</li>
            <li>Good hold, easily refreshed not too greasy.</li>
            <li>This product has a good texture which makes it easy for me to shape my hair.</li>
            <li>This is very strong stuff.</li>
            <li>This product makes styling my hair very easy.  </li>
            <li>Very easy.  </li>
            <li>This wax made it very easy to mold to the style you want.</li>
            <li>Very strong, but flexible.  </li>
            <li>It is also very easy to wash off your hands compared to Claymation.</li>
            <li>It smells pretty good too!</li>
            <li>Best hair wax I have ever used by far!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I&#x27;m able to purchase Gatsby on Amazon!</li>
            <li>This is the best hair product I&#x27;ve used so far!</li>
            <li>good at molding your hair (if you have fine</li>
            <li>It is by far the best and my top favorite hair product I had ever used!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s been the best gel I found so far..</li>
            <li>The best stuff I&#x27;ve used by far and</li>
            <li>this is by far the best line up of hair products i have ever come across</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;it is by far the best for my hair</li>
            <li>It smells amazing and it washes off in the shower quite well unlike most greasy waxes that you get at the store.</li>
            <li>It does sticks to itself to an incredible degree (which is I guess where the whole pliable descriptor comes into play).</li>
            <li>It smells like lightly scented fruit shampoo, but once its on my hair the smell dissipates so it doesn&#x27;t leave a lingering odor, which I loved.  </li>
            <li>excelent product my hair enjoy it great comfort and easy aplication of the product</li>
            <li>but once it&#x27;s on your hair it is so easy to style because it can be moved!</li>
            <li>but it is very fine</li>
            <li>Really, really, really strong all-day hold!</li>
            <li>This is perfect for short spiky hair styles, and the scent is amazing.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve never had a product with such good hold while leaving my hair flexible, and good price!</li>
            <li>First off, it smells great.</li>
            <li>Everything went very smooth.  </li>
            <li>This is definitely the best stuff I have found so far, but it isn&#x27;t perfect for sure.</li>
            <li>Tried it the first time in Tokyo, and I&#x27;ve loved it since then.&lt;br /&gt;People often will also compliment me on its nice smell.</li>
            <li>The shipping was nice n&#x27; easy.</li>
            <li>but it is the strong hold kind, so</li>
            <li>I didnt like this product at first, but i now think it is a good product in its own way.</li>
            <li>A year ago, I got sort of a pomp-undercut (my hair is about four inches on top).</li>
            <li>I much prefer this over Bed Head for Men &amp;#34;Matte Separation Workable Wax&amp;#34; This is a great product.  </li>
            <li>love the product...</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I love how I can always add more product to touch up my hair throughout the day.</li>
            <li>I also love the matte look.</li>
            <li>It is without a doubt, the best hair product for short or even medium length spiky hair.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know why more people in the US don&#x27;t know about it.</li>
            <li>Will be buying more.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not being racist, it just works better.</li>
            <li>Ordered this as gift for my brother and he keeps asking for more.</li>
            <li>I love the Gatsby line of hair products.</li>
            <li>it should be noted that you need to thoroughly wash it out as it seems to cling to your hair a bit better than gel.</li>
            <li>Have been using this for many times.</li>
            <li>This is the best product I have ever used; especially as my hair grows out.  </li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite styling products out there.</li>
            <li>It lasts all day! :]</li>
            <li>will buy it again when I finish this one :)</li>
            <li>I wanted to buy more when it ran out but found out Redken stopped making it.  </li>
            <li>Gatsby, my love, my life, my savior.</li>
            <li>This is actually my favorite.  </li>
            <li>but Gatsby is much better</li>
            <li>And I can rework it throughout the day and it looks better and better.  </li>
            <li>I am a converted product user for sure. &#x3D;-)</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Moving Rubber, mostly Spiky Edge, for about eight years now, ever since discovering it as a Mormon missionary in Japan.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen many reviewers comment on it being \\&quot;too oily,\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I was going to go for the Gatsby \\&quot;Grunge Mat\\&quot; since many people said Spiky Edge was a bit oily, but it isn&#x27;t oily at all.   </li>
            <li>I also use hair spray along with it to assure my hair is perfect the entire day.</li>
            <li>let me more time to another things</li>
            <li>This product is okay.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I switched to suavecito and its much better.</li>
            <li>more words 1</li>
            <li>sure to check on their website because they have a style guide on how to use each type of their product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve got all of my stylists to use them and they love them as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Glad I discovered it.</li>
            <li>You will notice that the hold weakens throughout the day but you can counter by applying more product.  </li>
            <li>given I wouldn&#x27;t call the \\&quot;hold factor\\&quot; a 9/10 (more like a 7/10), I&#x27;m docking by one star.</li>
            <li>but i love the way it works.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll probably be able to find one that fits your hair and hair style.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff as you can refresh your style just by rubbing your hands through your hair.  </li>
            <li>Non-greasy, it won&#x27;t melt in 100-degree heat and most important of all IT HOLDS!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried AXE hair putties and whatnot but Moving Rubber works great on my straight hair.</li>
            <li>I love this &amp;#34;moving rubber&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>hold is ok.</li>
            <li>I had to wash my hair 3 times before it felt like it was mostly out...not all the way out but mostly out.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love the product and love the strawberry yogurt smell</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll for sure be buying this again.</li>
            <li>, I can keep touching it up...</li>
            <li>This product is more matte.</li>
            <li>My husband husband loves it and it doesn&#x27;t look greasy. :)</li>
            <li>It works great on both real and the synthetic hair.  </li>
            <li>My favorite hair product ever is no longer made, but this one is my favorite that I can still get.</li>
            <li>It leaves a bit of a residue , you may have to shampoo more than once.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll use Gatsby more sparingly for occasions.</li>
            <li>Love the hold I get from this product.</li>
            <li>Love it~</li>
            <li>However, like many reviews have mentioned..</li>
            <li>I try to go for the textured/tassled look up top, and try to keep the sides closer to my head...</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>one was just okay.</li>
            <li>but I found that it worked the best when left out overnight to harden.</li>
            <li>Best for Asian hair?</li>
            <li>So, if you&#x27;re more of a cubicle type of guy</li>
            <li>better value</li>
            <li>I really enjoy this brand!  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Love this wax.</li>
            <li>glad that I got</li>
            <li>American Crew Fiber, Hanz de fuko, would work best for thicker hair but not mine.</li>
            <li>The best product prior to Gatsby&#x27;s was [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>LOVE the consistency of the product itself...</li>
            <li>I have a buddy who lives in Osaka Japan and swears by this brand (as well as most Japanese-based hair products).</li>
            <li>Its better than gel</li>
            <li>but I have had better.</li>
            <li>I think a putty would&#x27;ve been a more appropriate moniker.</li>
            <li>When you rub the moving rubber in your fingers and palms it becomes more like tooth paste</li>
            <li>use sparingly might give you better</li>
            <li>But, otherwise I love the product.</li>
            <li>Keep that in mind I should have researched that part a bit more before committing to buy.</li>
            <li>Better than gel, moose, hair spray etc.</li>
            <li>If I needed to I could just add more dabs to my hair to make it spikier.  </li>
            <li>I love Gatsby and I have many colors.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li>He says it&#x27;s so easy to work with, it rinses CLEAN without residue, and it smells good.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m sure that doesn&#x27;t help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the spikes magically stands up.  </li>
            <li>Ron, if you will try Spiky Edge, you&#x27;d have to add one more product to that list.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than Snake Juice.</li>
            <li>Gatsby Moving Rubber Spiky Edge is my favorite wax to use for my hair.</li>
            <li>this product is amazing&lt;br /&gt;i might buy more for my friends as gift</li>
            <li>Edge\\&quot; wax has been my favorite wax for awhile</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely buy again! :D</li>
            <li>I think this is something I get better with the more time I use it.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Most of the reviews and I am assuming purchasers, are men.  </li>
            <li>i have a fo-hawk and i love this stuff.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t a strong odor to it, and it washes out very easily.  </li>
            <li>also this hair wax does not make your hair look oily or greasy and you dont need much to style your hair because this wax is very effective.</li>
            <li>Very unique texture, unlike anything I have ever tried before</li>
            <li>Perfect for men who are looking for stylish hair, but don&#x27;t put it too much ;)</li>
            <li>: I haven&#x27;t tried the grey one, yet, but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s just as awesome as the rest.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Holds great and keeps hair looking good all day long.  </li>
            <li>To sum this product up I would say its a great purchase if you like that more natural look, but if you can&#x27;t take some time out to put a bit more effort into washing your hair</li>
            <li>It also smells pretty good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty good product.</li>
            <li>Probably the best product I&#x27;ve used in a long time.</li>
            <li>Really good product for those who make their hair style very day!</li>
            <li>Loved it at first</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a clean cut look, use this!</li>
            <li>Best of the bunch, I bought most of the Gatsby products but I like my hair pretty short, Asian hair, this stuff is the best of the lot for me.  </li>
            <li>itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: affordable, super strong but pliable hold, don&#x27;t need a lot for effective hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>It does leave your hair feeling sticky but overall it is a very good product.</li>
            <li>Provided very good texture for short hair.</li>
            <li>for short to short-medium hair is very very good, just apply it like the instructions say, just a little bit, if u noticed that need or want more strong strenght to ur hairsatyle, aply a bit more trougn all the hair moving ur fingers into it, and u will have excellent results.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a product that felt light in my hair, but was able to manage my shorter hairs, which can be quite stubborn.  </li>
            <li>Works better than that cheap Axe hair wax stuff.</li>
            <li>WoW Excellent~~ Thank You so much!</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a nice fresh scent.</li>
            <li>I honestly didn&#x27;t even need 2 finger worth of it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good if you want that really really spiky effect.</li>
            <li>Fantastic and very unique.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a pretty good amount inside, and shouldn&#x27;t need more than a couple finger scoops worth.</li>
            <li>Likewise, if your hair is easily tamed then go for the weaker of the two (the purple).    </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to wash off both from your hands and your hair.</li>
            <li>, do it well, are easy to work with, don&#x27;t leave flakes and wash out relatively easily.</li>
            <li>Came packaged great, same as most companies.</li>
            <li>and then when it dries (very quickly) I have fab</li>
            <li>The ordering and buying was easy.  </li>
            <li>.. stays on all day and easy to come off in shampoo</li>
            <li>easy is it to work into the hair?  </li>
            <li>it wash out easily?  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a hair product that holds strong and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>However, it does not flake, and can easily be adjusted throughout the day without loss of holding power.</li>
            <li>It does not wash off that easily like he said...</li>
            <li>Easily applied  </li>
            <li>/&gt; - easy to style&lt;</li>
            <li>has proven to have as strong of a hold.  </li>
            <li>holds strong.</li>
            <li>The main thing that bothers me is if you use a good amount in your hair you&#x27;ll have to shampoo twice and condition</li>
            <li>Stuff is strong.</li>
            <li>strong hold and flexible on the hair</li>
            <li>cause it so strong of a hold.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s strong, yet doesn&#x27;t make your hair look greasy or feel crunchy.</li>
            <li>Strong hold as advertised.</li>
            <li>Purple is strong with shine.  </li>
            <li>now, I&#x27;m going to stick with Paul Mitchell Men Reformer Strong Hold/Matte Finish Texturizer for Men.  </li>
            <li>A great hair wax, gives a long hold, doesn&#x27;t shine, and smells pretty good.</li>
            <li>Non greasy but strong and smells fine.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s very mild and light, so</li>
            <li>It washes out just fine for me.</li>
            <li>If you follow exactly what he&#x27;s doing, it works perfectly and only takes a minute or two.  </li>
            <li>then it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>Use less that you think, and rub in palms until its gone basically, and it works great!</li>
            <li>Cheap and work super well!</li>
            <li>Overall, I am very pleased with the product!</li>
            <li>I mix a little with the grunge Gatsby wax, seems to be the best combo for me.  </li>
            <li>this is most definitely worth a try.  </li>
            <li>Both products worked great for my hair, but I found that the Gatsby lasted a bit longer even though it is a smaller size, 2.8oz vs 3.3oz for the Goldwell.  </li>
            <li>Works out great, Spyky Edge is for upper medium strength tug on hair.</li>
            <li>This choice is great for short to medium length hair.</li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s a great product</li>
            <li>I enjoy this product, I don&#x27;t even need to use hairspray.</li>
            <li>i enjoy this product</li>
            <li>It has a pliable, flexible, matte looking hold perfect for creating pieced, spiked, messy hairstyles.</li>
            <li>Great lasting holding power</li>
            <li>Overall, this is a great product.  </li>
            <li>Gatsby is just great  for asian hair.  </li>
            <li>Works great on my short hair.</li>
            <li>Over all, I enjoy the product.</li>
            <li>may also have mentioned that this product has a light scent.</li>
            <li>It works with great with short/medium length asian hair.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;and find this one is available in Amazon&lt;br /&gt;Get</li>
            <li>I heard this was a great product for asian hair, but it works well in mine as well.  </li>
            <li>Such great Quality...!&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>Overall this is great</li>
            <li>It is neither too heavy nor too light, which is just perfect for my short-medium length hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>product is good, it makes your hair look like it has natural volume</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not quite sure why it gets such good ratings.</li>
            <li>Washes out clean however, best to use deep clean shampoos or dove Fresh Clean 2 in 1 to rid of any build ups.  </li>
            <li>It drys pretty quickly and holds amazingly well.  </li>
            <li>When I started sending pics home to my girlfriend, she noticed right away that my hair looked much better.  </li>
            <li>Very good stuff, holds extremely well even with curly hair.</li>
            <li>And fast shipping!!!</li>
            <li>it is exactly the same as the one from China.&lt;br /&gt;I am really happy and satisfied with it, thank you</li>
            <li>Great product but unfortunately not made for people with natural curly hair.</li>
            <li>If you have anime hair or a major hawk or liberty spike situation, this would be a good product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went from a short messy hairdo to the now more popular undercut, and Gatsby Moving Rubber has held both hairstyles the best.  </li>
            <li>I was using this with medium longer hair and while does not have a strong stiff hold, it is still a very good flexible product for creating texture and form without shine or gloss.</li>
            <li>Bonus, it smells like fresh apples!</li>
            <li>Always worth the buy!</li>
            <li>I wash my hair first with bar soap, which works better than shampoo at getting the wax out, then follow up with shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Provides great hold and does what it was meant to do and keeps doing it long after the day has ended.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but totally worth it!</li>
            <li>but each have a unique set of pros and cons.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for long hair.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m still using the original container)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Superior to Axe products (not hard to believe) and the price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best product I have used for my short spiky hair.</li>
            <li>Overall I liked them all, but Moving Rubber is my favorite by far.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it wasn&#x27;t strong strong enought to hold certain spots of my hair</li>
            <li>It works best for that fine asian hair, and it has pretty good hold for short hair, and the hold is good for something little longer length.</li>
            <li>Good product for the price, unique smell,it is different, but I like it.</li>
            <li>This product is very good at defining hair spikes and because of that hair spray should not be used with this product it’ll would be redundant to do so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really good product, helps give me a messy look very easily.</li>
            <li>works good but wont last for all day</li>
            <li>I use this + the blue one to keep a good sheen and hold for my hair.</li>
            <li>After a full day of work its still holding.</li>
            <li>In this case it&#x27;s cool, since it IS meant for men after all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I like it, it get the job done, the only complain is that you HAVE to wash your hair, with a good shampoo</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to create waves with my straight hair by just applying this product and twisting .</li>
            <li>This was is good for making your short hair stand up without looking greasy or hardened.</li>
            <li>I have every colour of Moving Rubber there is and can&#x27;t say enough good things about them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t say enough good things about these products.</li>
            <li>It has a sweet scent.  </li>
            <li>I just absolutely love how fast the item gets to me.</li>
            <li>Really good for asian hair.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s true.  </li>
            <li>One more thing this products dries relatively fast so when you’re taking the wax you need</li>
            <li>Does not leave flakes and has no bad smell.</li>
            <li>Not bad though.</li>
            <li>It;s easy to apply and not too shiny, perfect for straight, course, unbelievably damaged hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many many many other hair gels and waxes.</li>
            <li>This holds insanely strong and if I apply a bit too much, my hair begins to hold and clump like glue!</li>
            <li>It is pretty easy to tell when this product is used however.</li>
            <li>First and foremost I Don&#x27;t give out five stars easily, If I could I&#x27;d give this product a 4.5 out of 5.   </li>
            <li>Washing out the wax is pretty easy.</li>
            <li>Perfect for spiking hair and it stays soft enough at first to style then dries and holds.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Gatsby for many years and there are some minor flaws but can be fix to enjoy this product even more.</li>
            <li>Very great product :) holds my hair up keeps it smelling like green apple and overall a really great product to give you that anime or asian look;)</li>
            <li>Also, it dries quickly which helps to create volume.</li>
            <li>i have thick,and coarse Asian hair and this product is perfect for me.</li>
            <li>but it goes away quickly after putting it in your hair.</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;m lucky, I know  ppl that has that problem  though.</li>
            <li>2nd, I LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>OK so first thing&#x27;s first, im</li>
            <li>It is super sticky.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy the fact that you don&#x27;t need to use very much product to get your hair to do what you want.</li>
            <li>For years I used Alterna Hair Concrete which did a really good job of holding my short Chinese hair, lol.  </li>
            <li>Generally I have trouble finding a good gel, but Gatsby is AMAZING!</li>
            <li>gift item for guys and girls who want to look fabulous ;)</li>
            <li>That works great too, but I definitely prefer Gatsby over got2b mainly because of the texture it gives your hair.</li>
            <li>This is especially good for controlling shorter asian hair that seems to grow straight out and not down.</li>
            <li>Good, reliable product which will hold your hair all day long !</li>
            <li>But it is a slight inconvenience to an otherwise great product.</li>
            <li>Great for sculpting a variety of styles and when your hair starts to lose it&#x27;s style, just slightly we hands and rework into hair to reactivate the product.  </li>
            <li>I would say if you have strong sturdy hair this product would really work well for you</li>
            <li>The two problems I have with it is although this is a strong point for some it makes your hair real matte to the point where it seems like your hair might be dyed</li>
            <li>Pretty good for my asian hair.</li>
            <li>If my hair is too dry, the wax doesn&#x27;t give me as good of a hold.</li>
            <li>It is by far hands down the best hair styling product I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Works exactly as promised!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using these for years and at my mid 40&#x27;s, I still love it!  </li>
            <li>A little bit sticky but does a great job on my faux hawk hair style.</li>
            <li>Still, give it a shot if you have short hair, it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>It did feel relatively light in my hair without too much residue or gunkiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>its very creamy &amp; smooth.</li>
            <li>Looks like no product, and my hair is so calm and behaved you</li>
            <li>This Mandom Moving Rubber does the job, is economically priced, and is made without parabens.</li>
            <li>its nothing near what gel or hair spray does.&lt;br /&gt;Gatsby products are fantastic!</li>
            <li>be too powerful of a product for you</li>
            <li>wanna try got2b if it is in fact that powerful</li>
            <li>This stuff keeps your hair looking freshly done.</li>
            <li>It was worth a try but oily and not my type of wax</li>
            <li>I ordered this not only for my own hair but to style the wigs I use for cosplay.  </li>
            <li>Best hair product for straight thick hair.</li>
            <li>My hair looks awesome and my friends are always curious how it stays up for the entire day</li>
            <li>Its styling power will not diminish as the day goes on, leaving you with a freshly styled look all day.</li>
            <li>B000V2ACHI GATSBY MOVING RUBBER WILD SHAKE Hair Wax, 80g/2.8oz]] and Spiky Edge for the shorter hairs to give out a more define look.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I love it so far.</li>
            <li>Have some fun with your hair.</li>
            <li>Overall great hold with the natural look.</li>
            <li>So far I really love it.  </li>
            <li>Would prefer a more masculine smell.</li>
            <li>a dime size on the palm, and smooth into the hair.&lt;br /&gt;Sides, back, top, front.</li>
            <li>Usually I love opening a new container and using it for the first time.  </li>
            <li>Which is great in my book since I can&#x27;t stand hair care products that make my hair as stiff as a rock.   </li>
            <li>: Great styling ability - even with my stiff hair, it can sculpt and hold its shape.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than anything I&#x27;ve tried at retail stores, and about equal to Aveda Control Paste without the high price, and you get more per ounce.  </li>
            <li>If you watch the video on the desktop site (doesn&#x27;t show up on the mobile site for some reason) to the right of all the pictures, it shows a guy applying it to his hair.  </li>
            <li>use this product right after a haircut then switch to the purple one when my hair gets longer.</li>
            <li>So then, this product seemed like it was right up my alley.</li>
            <li>I have tried many other hair spiking product agents, and no other has even come close to how good this one is.</li>
            <li>This product is only slightly less strong than that, but it is still strong enough to get my hair to spike up and stay that way and best of all</li>
            <li>Gatsby isn&#x27;t a solid like the hair stick, which makes application very easy.  </li>
            <li>I think Wild Shake is better if you need a bit more pliable action or not quite so much hold.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best hair product I&#x27;ve ever tried - you get amazing hold with only a tiny amount so the little tub goes a really long way, and it even smells nice!</li>
            <li>Though even my hair is so fine it still kind of falls a little bit</li>
            <li>It is harder to wash out and not quite as soft, but the best I have tried so far.</li>
            <li>In my attempt to use more natural, non-cancer-causing products, I found the whole line of Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soaps, and this Mandom Gatsby Moving Rubber.</li>
            <li>But, for hold, texture, non greasy/shiny, and doesn&#x27;t wear off at the end of the day, this is great, especially for my asian hair.</li>
            <li>This is really a great product, especially if you wear your hair short and just use your hands to shape your hair and style it.  </li>
            <li>This makes your hair easy to form and forget, it naturally get imbedded into the hair and you shape it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m Asian and my hair sticks out and this does a great job of taming my hair especially on the sides.</li>
            <li>Short hair really doesn&#x27;t flatter a man when he puts on a suit or even a nice dress shirt.  </li>
            <li>and super fast shipping.</li>
            <li>It is very light yet where it does not bring the hair down yet holds hair strong.  </li>
            <li>It still keeps hair looking great after sleeping on it all night long - just style it again or add a little more.  </li>
            <li>I wasted money on many, many, many products trying to duplicate the same results.</li>
            <li>They mold the hair fine but take away the natural shine and make hair look like it needs washing.</li>
            <li>I got this to pack in with other stuff I needed more to get the over $25 free ship.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair (not thin, but fine) that ranges from wavy to curly on different parts of my head.</li>
            <li>It also comes in a cool little case and smells nice.</li>
            <li>Great hold without making your hair hard.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t want to put too much you&#x27;ll lose texture and definition to your hair, it&#x27;s better to work with a little amount and add more if needed too.</li>
            <li>Good spikes easy to be made and presumably slicked back hair or other styles</li>
            <li>I first bought this product when I was in Hong Kong a year ago.</li>
            <li>I guess it&#x27;s different for most ppl.</li>
            <li>Work better on Asian hair</li>
            <li>The PINK Rubber Spiky Edge Hair Wax is definitely nice.</li>
            <li>and I wasn&#x27;t aware of the line for women.</li>
            <li>I have been using tigi wax stick, crew wax and various forms of powders (Sexy Hair Big Sexy Hair Powder Play, Osis + Dust</li>
            <li>Can wear wet if you like that look.&lt;br /&gt;Con: kind of bulky to put into travel bag.</li>
            <li>The wax is a lot different from most wax products on the market and it does have a rubbery feel to it once your hair is styled.  </li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve had it, I have only had to use the product that gets stuck to the top cover of the container.</li>
            <li>I plan on trying more Gatsby products in the future.</li>
            <li>ive tried MANY different hair products but this product went beyond my expectations.</li>
            <li>This is a great product to try at least once.</li>
            <li>also makes your hair feel pretty</li>
            <li>Holds my hair pretty well.</li>
            <li>This does exactly that.</li>
            <li>; moniker is never truer than it is with this product because that&#x27;s exactly how it felt like: covering my hair in rubber.</li>
            <li>but I used mine to do a side part hair style and it worked pretty great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the hold consistent?</li>
            <li>I have used Crew Fiber (blue top) for years.</li>
            <li>This isnt quite the same as it is more creamy</li>
            <li>Great for my thick hair.</li>
            <li>Once I came back to the States I was pleased to find out that Amazon sells Gatsby products.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This stuff is exactly what the doctor ordered.</li>
            <li>but the real killer is trying to get it out!</li>
            <li>This is my first time buying any wax products for my hair</li>
            <li>I am actually going to experiment with more of them since they can be inter used and serve specialized purposes</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many different hair wax products.</li>
            <li>I love it, and will definitely buy it again!</li>
            <li>To wash it out I first shampoo my hair, condition it and run a comb through it as I&#x27;m conditioning it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much better than American Brands.</li>
            <li>Like many others, I have tried lots of different hair gels and waxes but none like the Gatsby spyky edge.</li>
            <li>And if I add more, it just feels gross and looks like I rubbed vaseline on my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>No need of hairspray since Spiky Edge holds up pretty well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You should always make sure to close the lid properly after use.</li>
            <li>It manages my short hairs better and is equally non-gunky most of the time.  </li>
            <li>Glued Spiking Glue is water resistant (sweat resistant) and provides all day hold even in this hot and humid weather.</li>
            <li>Yes, I&#x27;m a spiky haired asian fella. :)</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is my first experience with Gatsby</li>
            <li>Hair stays up the whole day!</li>
            <li>So one of the techniques that I’ve learned to deal with this problem is to either comb it while washing your hair or wash it first then</li>
            <li>I recognize that many of the people who like the Moving Rubber have different hair than mine, so I&#x27;m just sharing my experience, not disagreeing with theirs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works great for my thick hair.  </li>
            <li>My first try</li>
            <li>I first found out about this product while I was in Japan.  </li>
            <li>I was hesitant at first as there were so many different types that I was overwhelmed.  </li>
            <li>A+ Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Mandoms Gatsby wax and UNO Wax by Shiseido are the only brands of wax I have used in my life that I truly love and works how I want it too.  </li>
            <li>It is the first wax I came across that reliably held my hair</li>
            <li>Overall, I love this stuff</li>
            <li>... while it worked good, there was a few drawbacks.</li>
            <li>: Really good stiff hold yet flexible.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Gatsby products are all-around good for styling without the mess and the \\&quot;greasy\\&quot; look.</li>
            <li>First of all the pink gatsby has very strong hold</li>
            <li>For the past couple of years I was using crew creams and they did a perfect job, but I didn&#x27;t really like the fact that it left your hair a bit shiny, even the ones that advertised making your hair look &amp;#34;matte&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Distributes nice and evenly due to consistency.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m Asian and have been having a hard time finding the perfect hair styling product.  </li>
            <li>, it smells great like green apple and no shine with natural looks.</li>
            <li>That has a much stronger hold than that of the pink kind.</li>
            <li>The product is cheap and you are definitely getting your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>In turn, you will get a lot of crunchiness and the \\&quot;wet look\\&quot; - effectively defeating the whole matte theme of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have thick asian hair and it is perfect.</li>
            <li>I tried a more expensive version of Gatsby and loved it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many, many different types of hair wax and gels, and this tops every single one of them.</li>
            <li>, very straight, like my side burns grows out straight type.</li>
            <li>I stumbled upon this when my previous hair wax ran out during a trip to Japan, and the first use was an AMAZING revelation.</li>
            <li>At first I made the mistake of applying too much at once</li>
            <li>I have tried out pretty much every gatsby product out there</li>
            <li>Even after 2 days I could just fluff up my hair, retouch with a flat iron and it looked great.  </li>
            <li>Pretty much what everyone says about this....</li>
            <li>My hair is about 5-6 inches long up top</li>
            <li>The best product for my asian, thick, straight hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;- technique sensitive (which is true for any hair styling products)</li>
            <li>I have tried many types of gel and even mousse, but this is the best.&lt;br /&gt;Strong hold, no flaking, no discoloration, lasts for a decent amount of time, and you only need a little.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Works very well, I&#x27;ve been jumping around different hair gels, pomades, and creams trying to find the right fit.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyways, I will buy a fresh new one and update this review.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and doesn&#x27;t make your hair feel gross or gunky.</li>
            <li>I prefer the Gatsby Wild Shake to this for my hair, but that&#x27;s because I am not looking for the super hold that this product provides.</li>
            <li>I believe the hold is slightly better if you apply it on hair that is dry.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, this is a fantastic hair product and I&#x27;m willing to only order this to style my hair.</li>
            <li>but they where sold out, none the less I liked this product</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s strong, so expect it to feel sticky, especially after you apply it</li>
            <li>Strong hold, low shine.</li>
            <li>It has a strong hold, gives your hair that extra point.  </li>
            <li>I chose this because others described it as having strong, lasting hold that isn&#x27;t oily or flaky.</li>
            <li>It is strong enough hold my hair for 8+ hrs and does not make my hair look shiny like some products.</li>
            <li>look and this stuff certainly did the trick.</li>
            <li>The pink one is best for short hair while I used the purple when I have medium to long hair.</li>
            <li>but when you rub it between  your hands it turns sticky and slightly pink/white, but surprisingly goes on clear once you work it into your hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also pretty strong and can hold your hair in desirable position for a long time.</li>
            <li>Amazing how little of this product i needed to keep my hair in place!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and you can even mess with  your hair and still be able to style it back to the way it was without applying more of the product.</li>
            <li>and you can get that clean cut asian style hair or a pretty gnarly grungy look.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m from Sweden and it has been really hard to find a good hair wax product that doesn&#x27;t feel too unnatural when applied.</li>
            <li>Product in good order, came a little late but overall great</li>
            <li>However, it did add that classic Asian pop idol texture to my hair, which was new and interesting.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s apparently a huge different between the 9 to 10 on this</li>
            <li>I got this for my boyfriend and he really likes it.</li>
            <li>price isn&#x27;t too shabby although it used to be much cheaper</li>
            <li>The pink one is my favorite.</li>
            <li>Dries fast, residue fades away, is a bit sticky.</li>
            <li>Using a quarter-sized dollop of this stuff in my hair after showering and towel drying my hair keeps my hair in check and allows me to spike, gently tousle, or give my hair some texture.</li>
            <li>Without any product in my hair, I have Brillo Pad hair - it&#x27;s really poofy.</li>
            <li>Hold - Not so much.  </li>
            <li>The price is much steeper for the Goldwell as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Edge/Red(looks more Pink) ---</li>
            <li>Works really well</li>
            <li>It holds very well and shapes my hair really well.  </li>
            <li>The hair wax works really well.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really do anything for my hair.</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t really style it a lot with this wax.</li>
            <li>I need my hair product to set fast or</li>
            <li>I appreciate it because i have so much control in the application and disbursement</li>
            <li>real well it gets my hair to go directions</li>
            <li>me using a bit too much product.</li>
            <li>so a need to be fast while styling helped me.</li>
            <li>look no further try this.the smell is great like green apples very fruity .</li>
            <li>The delievery is really fast.</li>
            <li>you dont need much, about a fingertip spread over your palm will do.</li>
            <li>It does not take a lot to do what it is suppose to do, and it does it very well.  </li>
            <li>This dries to wax somewhat and gives it more strength (although it is slightly harder to work through your hair).</li>
            <li>The product is very matted with no shine at all.</li>
            <li>In a world of having to use too much of something</li>
            <li>I DON&#x27;T USE MUCH AND HAVE THIS STOCKED UP.  </li>
            <li>It does make your hair sticky (of course), but it doesn&#x27;t really make it look greasy anything.</li>
            <li>Very unnatural.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s hold much faster when you&#x27;re exposed to moisture.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Spiky Edge does not provide that much shine, unless you apply a ton of it (which you don&#x27;t need at all).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This stuff helps my hair so much.</li>
            <li>I really like this stuff.</li>
            <li>Works very well on medium (4-5in) hair.</li>
            <li>Definitely reasonable for its &amp;#60;$10 price tag.</li>
            <li>applying it is straight forward...</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t really look like you have any product in your hair.</li>
            <li>keep the shape for my hair throughout the whole day&lt;br</li>
            <li>really well</li>
            <li>It even seems to work well in all of our humidity (south Louisiana - really sticky).  </li>
            <li>So I don&#x27;t really need it specifically for that.</li>
            <li>It really helps control my hair, and give it texture.</li>
            <li>This REALLY holds your hair.</li>
            <li>My hair sticks straight out from my head even at 3-4 inches in length.  </li>
            <li>I look like a punk rocker that used a whole can of hair spray even without any hair product.  </li>
            <li>It really is like using &#x27;moving rubber&#x27;.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t work very well on my hair.</li>
            <li>it gives it a much nicer look while maintaining the hair style you want without the greasy look</li>
            <li>sometimes use it as well and really like the smell of it.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s available at your local CVS and</li>
            <li>I can even wet my hands and style it even more.</li>
            <li>Have straight hair.</li>
            <li>So thinning and straightening your hair can really give you that look you&#x27;ve always wanted.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this stuff.</li>
            <li>being said, I found the whole experience of wearing the product to be akin to slathering my head with an air and moisture-tight helmet of semi-liquid latex.</li>
            <li>so I really know how this product works.</li>
            <li>It really makes my style work.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much.  </li>
            <li>Really like this stuff.  </li>
            <li>It doesnt really leave my hair feeling greasy and almost feels as if there is nothing in my hair and</li>
            <li>Holds very well without looking to shiny.  </li>
            <li>I am very displeased with this.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper on Amazon than anywhere else.</li>
            <li>Shipped fast too.</li>
            <li>For some reason, our hair structure is just really think.</li>
            <li>Does not flake unless you put too much on.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>it holds really  </li>
            <li>really well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably keep using my old gel more on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>If you are looking to get a wax that can be applied easily and with moderate proportions than I would highly recommend this wax.</li>
            <li>I wish it was bigger because he goes through these pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Based on a quick estimate with this, my first tub, I&#x27;d say this should last me around three months or so.</li>
            <li>i had tried quite a few other hair styling products before discovering GMR but this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>I have normal Asian hair and it works fine</li>
            <li>This has better hold and control than any other product in the US.  </li>
            <li>It washed off better than other waxes and it has an apple smell.</li>
            <li>day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other products like Got2Be and many other gels that I use just make me spikes look clumpy and make me look like im thinning.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many other hair styling products.</li>
            <li>While other products might harden when set, this stuff kinda sets your hair, but then you&#x27;re still able to move it and reposition at will.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not disappointed, and I definitely got a bargain; but seeing this product called &amp;#34;hair wax&amp;#34</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a bit pricey, (2) it has a whole bunch of parabens, which is my main reason for moving away from Crew products.</li>
            <li>much do you need to get a decent hold?  </li>
            <li>I had really high hopes with this product, but it didn&#x27;t really meet my expectations.  </li>
            <li>It has somewhat of a shine if you put too much, but a little is good enough to make your hair stick.</li>
            <li>Tried both of them and this hands down beats Murray&#x27;s due to the fact that it&#x27;s much easier to clean out and it smells rather nice</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s strange to see it for this price, but it is fantastic stuff.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make your hair rigid, but has enough to control the shape, true to its &amp;#34;moving rubber&amp;#34; name.  </li>
            <li>Most days, my hair was hit-or-miss depending on how much product I used, whether my hair was a bit wet, how far Jupiter was from Mars...</li>
            <li>This helps you to get a cool asian hair styled look.</li>
            <li>This stuff works and it works without making your hair feel gross to the ladies (wife in my case, full disclosure).</li>
            <li>and it has to be my favorite hair product hands down.</li>
            <li>probably the best i&#x27;ve had, i&#x27;ve used American Crew Fiber, Got2be Glued and a few other waxes.</li>
            <li>While it&#x27;s not exactly sticky per se, it is...tacky and heavy are probably the best words I can think of to describe the consistency of it on my hair (even using only a dab).</li>
            <li>If you like this manufacturer and need more hold (for slightly longer hair), check out Grunge Mat.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not very stick and easy to wash off from your hands after you are done.</li>
            <li>Works great for my thick spikey Asian hair!</li>
            <li>Fantastic product for Messy Hairstyles, Up Spiky and just generally fun moving styles.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t even dipped my fingers into the main portion of the jar container.</li>
            <li>I did notice that this particular product seems to lose</li>
            <li>I mainly use HdF Claymation and while it worked, I had to use quite a bit and then douse it in hairspray to keep my hair locked in place.</li>
            <li>usually wash my hair out with a cheaper shampoo first, then wash it again with better shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>( this particular one has lasted over a month)</li>
            <li>It acts it&#x27;s name and is highly malleable.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this hair wax to my friends.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>High quality</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend to my friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I decided to check this product out because of its popularity and consistently high rating.</li>
            <li>If you want more of a wavy, natural look try the other moving rubbers out.</li>
            <li>holds well, and i&#x27;ve left the container open a few times for a day, but if i close it, it&#x27;s back to normal, and works again like new :D</li>
            <li>had very very short hair when i started using this product, but to my comfort it was really good, nice smell, but don&#x27;t abuse it, don&#x27;t put too much because you are going to have an undesired result, so as long as you go little by little testing how it works for you</li>
            <li>the internet for hundreds of tutorials on how to use the product, not only you will find useful tips, but also a chuckle and</li>
            <li>It worked pretty well but left my hair frizzy but held really well.  </li>
            <li>Only thing I didn&#x27;t love was this product took a long time to ship.</li>
            <li>smell is sweet (not masculine) and overbearing for me being a guy</li>
            <li>I took two finger worth of the product and thought it wouldn&#x27;t be enough but started rubbing it in my hand and ran it through my hair.</li>
            <li>It literally turned rock solid in the jar and pretty much glued itself to the container.</li>
            <li>My hair length ranges from very short on the sides to 2-3 inches long on top.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely not just for men even though I rarely see reviews by females and there are no females on the Gatsby site.</li>
            <li>Spiky Edge has a pretty strong hold when applying to your palms it tends to pull your hair especially if it&#x27;s medium short hair o_O!</li>
            <li>This is available at the local Japanese supermarket, but it&#x27;s more convenient for me to have it delivered to my house by Amazon, and it&#x27;s slightly cheaper to boot.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t as greasy as many of the typical ones and it looks quite natural.</li>
            <li>If the hold isn&#x27;t strong enough for you, I recommend leaving the container open for a day or two.</li>
            <li>Strong enough to hold for an entire day.</li>
            <li>A strong, dry, and &amp;quot;rubbery&amp;quot; hold that lasts all day while retaining much of its initial pliability.</li>
            <li>Only issue is taht on hot days i do tend to notice it being a little more oily.</li>
            <li>So in short, Gatsby Pink for short (mega short) OR longer hair (up to 3\\&quot;)works wonders and is great for hold and flexibility.</li>
            <li>What also great is that you can reshape your hair anytime of the day by just a little water, moist your palms and rub it on your hair, a few brush strokes and your set.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The pink version is normally for people with shorter hair and is the one most widely used, there are many other versions also</li>
            <li>I live in japan, and I can buy this product for a slim 210...</li>
            <li>new cause</li>
            <li>This stuff lets you take your hair to new heights, which is what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>My husband cannot live without this product.</li>
            <li>even earlier, I&#x27;ve yet to find a product that can work with my unruly Asian coarse hair that could easily be made into a paint brush!</li>
            <li>The subtle apple scent is a nice touch.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a white guy with thin brown hair and this stuff works great for my hair style</li>
            <li>I tried most of the options from the pink, to purple, and even the blue gel.</li>
            <li>The wax is pretty water resistant/sweat resistant once it dries, but when first applying it, do not get it wet</li>
            <li>Has a really subtle scent and looks nice.</li>
            <li>It works very well with my straight asian hair.</li>
            <li>Definitely will hold your hair the whole day, maybe hairspray will help to keep hairstyle in place the whole day but its an option.</li>
            <li>I sometimes steal a little from him to tame flyaways, and it works great.</li>
            <li>This product was made for Asian hair (very straight hair).</li>
            <li>reason I like their products is that they doesn&#x27;t feel stiff like glue or sticky as pomades, yet able to shape your hair looking natural; it is no wonder it is called \\&quot;moving rubber\\</li>
            <li>I only need to use a little and it leaves my hair nice and soft, but styled all day.  </li>
            <li>I also prefer this over American Crew Fiber, which was the first product I started off with before moving on to Bed Head and</li>
            <li>Packaging - exactly the same as shown.  </li>
            <li>No weird next day product feel to your hair, no need to wash your hair twice to get it out.  </li>
            <li>I know its meant for men but the first time I heard about this was back in 2010</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought my first container (Spiky Edge) back in 2010 and still use Gatsby products to day.</li>
            <li>As you can see on most of the videos or tutorials: ALL YOU NEED IS A SMALL AMOUNT</li>
            <li>Excited to try their other products as well.</li>
            <li>It actually looks very matte!</li>
            <li>been using this product for almost a year now, been always trying out other products, to see if i like it better, but ive been always coming back to this product!!.</li>
            <li>If you do have very short hair, most of the above criteria will not matter in which case it actually is a solid contender.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>case is like heatproof (like i put it in my apron while pushing carts as a bagger in about 90 degrees), my bed hair looks better than what I usually try to style my hair for.</li>
            <li>up&amp;#34; look, go for the Wild Shake!</li>
            <li>I am looking for exactly the same product I bring from China</li>
            <li>Like right after applying it theres tiny white flakes everywhere for the whole</li>
            <li>Hair stays in place except in unusually harsh conditions with a more natural, matte appearance and is relatively soft, not stiff and sticky.</li>
            <li>and I recommend it for anyone who have very fine hair but grows in really thick.</li>
            <li>My problem then was that American products with great hold left my hair stiff and flaky, and stuff that was softer left my hair slimy and</li>
            <li>This is pretty much what I expected.</li>
            <li>The product itself has a pleasant, but faint apple smell.</li>
            <li>I have relatively fine hair as well, and this helps give it a little volume.</li>
            <li>With a little more than average shampoo than you normally use will do the trick.e the lid!!!</li>
            <li>I was previously using American Crew Fiber but wasn&#x27;t totally satisfied.</li>
            <li>Less is more in this case as if you apply too much it gets harder to style your hair.  </li>
            <li>I love the fact that I can mess with my hair and reshape it well after initially putting it in my hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also seen many reviewers talking about how hard it is to wash out.</li>
            <li>product holds well but easily catches lint and other white stuff in your hair.  </li>
            <li>It has the same hold as Bed Head, but it is MUCH softer, and it also lasts all day.</li>
            <li>its a real deal and makes my short hair stand out</li>
            <li>Wild and spiky</li>
            <li>rise/Green --- Soft and volume/ Medium to medium long&lt;</li>
            <li>Motion/Yellow --- Natural &amp; nuance / Medium</li>
            <li>, the real test is the next day when you wake up and this product passed the test with flying colors.  </li>
            <li>It keeps my hair looking natural as well and its still touchable.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t naturally go</li>
            <li>Ive had this product for a couple of months now, I dont like using products that make my hair looks greasy or too incredibly wild for I work in customer service in a professional</li>
            <li>He only had one of these and stated he was testing it out to see if he wants to carry it in his salon.</li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S JUST A NATURAL HAIRSTYLE.  </li>
            <li>I initially opened the package and after seeing the stuff, didn&#x27;t think it would really hold my hair well.</li>
            <li>My hair did look matte and it made my hair look natural as if I wasn&#x27;t wearing any products.</li>
            <li>Works so well for straighter Asian hair compared to the products you would normally available in your local drugstore, supermarket, or big box store.</li>
            <li>This stuff leaves hair soft.</li>
            <li>In contrast, Grunge Mat is far, far stronger than this product (which Moving Rubber ranks as a 10/10).  </li>
            <li>natural does the hair feel throughout the day?  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s real life use, however, this product should only be for people with the shortest of hair (&lt;1 inch).  </li>
            <li>and it will stay that way for the rest of the day in a natural way.</li>
            <li>All I can say is wow.</li>
            <li>old girls.</li>
            <li>, it looks natural, no gelly smell,</li>
            <li>My hair sticks straight out when its short and somewhat flattens out as it grows out.</li>
            <li>Natural look</li>
            <li>and it is an all natural matte look.</li>
            <li>One application of this product will last you the whole day.  </li>
            <li>My second purchase of this product and highly recommend!</li>
            <li>think I had straight Japanese hair instead of the Filipino Brillo</li>
            <li>As far as i know.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a natural look.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used countless amounts of hair products (I have asian hair) and honestly thank god everyday for introducing me to this product.</li>
            <li>Styling wise for me was difficult.</li>
            <li>They like to roll around and play constantly and it was a chore trying to keep their edges laid down and stop them from becoming fuzzy.</li>
            <li>The spiky edge wax is very lightweight so it won&#x27;t weigh your hair down, yet allows you to mold you hair exactly how you want.</li>
            <li>Maybe if you used a lot of product it might be more difficult to remove, but I found it washes right out.</li>
            <li>Compared to other wax or similar products such as those of Axe, Mandom Gatsby gives you flexibility while maintaining hold much better.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a hair product that would not feel stiff or overly oily and this Moving Rubber product fit.  </li>
            <li>I have a pixie cut with short, short sides and long in front (5-6 inches), and shorter on the upper top (3-4 inches) of my hair</li>
            <li>Without any product in my hair, I just look flat out lame and a good 10 years older for some reason.</li>
            <li>I usually wear my hair short but as it grows longer I like a product that can handle the weight and length better.  </li>
            <li>This product is mainly for people with short to medium hair as the gatsby chart proclaims, which be seen here.</li>
            <li>The texture is fine, I just personally prefer something less goopy.</li>
            <li>This product has a thin, creamy texture that is very easy to spread into the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li>I barely have to use any Moving Rubber to get the desired result, with other products, it seems I have to use huge globs to get my hair to do the same thing.</li>
            <li>This is a great value, and i found myself using a whole lot less product than my other Gatsby products (preferably the pink and green jars), it just gets a little tough to wash out because of the extra texture, but all good it still washes out easy overall.</li>
            <li>I have been using Gatsby Moving Rubber since high school and have not turned back from it!  </li>
            <li>use a little and work into hair, then i will take a tiny bit more and lather in my hands to form the final look of my hair.</li>
            <li>With a little more than average shampoo than you normally use will do the trick.</li>
            <li>My hair is an inch or two long over my whole head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I usually order with free shipping</li>
            <li>My hair is not long so I only need as much as the tip of my finger.</li>
            <li>That said, I&#x27;ve found this to be true of every other hair product I&#x27;ve used (except those that rigidly lock hair in place, such as Got 2B</li>
            <li>(probably about 5 - 6 inches long on the top) and other products just weighed it down too much.  </li>
            <li>The downside to this product is that it makes your hair feel very dry after using it, and it kind of hard to wash out.</li>
            <li>I use Short Sexy&#x27;s Hard Up gel, nothing else</li>
            <li>For my short hair days and any other time I want a super hold I use this product.  </li>
            <li>This stuff doesn&#x27;t require as much product to achieve the same result, but much lighter feeling and locks in place extremely well.</li>
            <li>concern is that this product get dried too fast and very</li>
            <li>i use this everyday and pretend i am Goku going from super saiyan level 1 to 3</li>
            <li>The product is not a wax, nor &amp;#34;rubbery&amp;#34; - the texture is more like a really thick greek yogurt.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s major selling point.  </li>
            <li>Glad that the green apple smell does not last too long.</li>
            <li>Now, I use it as sort of a complement to the other gatsby product to tame the more stubborn parts.</li>
            <li>It gives a much more cleaner and natural look compared to the hard and wet look you get from gel.</li>
            <li>I love that you can still run your fingers through your hair to play with it, and add more product and it won&#x27;t make your head feel heavy or dirty.  </li>
            <li>The top is not that long either, usually between 1&amp;#34; and 2&amp;#34;, so I use this product for only the top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for some time now</li>
            <li>everytime you want to get it out to get your hair back to it&#x27;s natural softness.</li>
            <li>Any young Asian man should give this a try.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried using Crew Pomades, both styling and grooming, but they&#x27;re just far too oily and do not offer enough strength.</li>
            <li>, being out in direct sunlight, you can actually feel it melt and collapse within minutes.</li>
            <li>Along with most everyone else is saying, it helps to thin out your hair.  </li>
            <li>I have had long hair my entire adult life and had no clue what types of product to use for the new style.  </li>
            <li>It will probably be used everyday for the next month too and still have enough for a few more days!</li>
            <li>I have fine short hair thats hard to style, but this stuff does the trick.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried only a few different brands of hair gel/wax products and was fortunate to stumble onto this early in my search for a go-to product and have since stuck with this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap ($10 on Amazon as of my purchase, $13 at local stores) and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>, I think that this particular product is not meant for such long hair.</li>
            <li>It has a hint of apple smell, but like other said, not SO much that you smell fruity or like a girl</li>
            <li>This is a great gel if you&#x27;re looking for a little casual look but still have that hold.</li>
            <li>Its a lot more hold than American Crew, but I find the side effect is it makes my hair rock hard dry.</li>
            <li>For Asian individuals, it&#x27;s really hard to find a hair product that is strong enough to style our hair texture.</li>
            <li>It looks like white cream, but it goes on clear, leaving no white flakes or residuals</li>
            <li>(I have tried 4 different Gatsby waxes and the Pink seems to offer the strongest hold and is very versatile).  </li>
            <li>Works really well for styling thick asian hair, and I only need a fingertip&#x27;s worth so it should last awhile.</li>
            <li>&quot; ingredients does not dry my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>; I expected something a bit more thick and waxy, like a clay.</li>
            <li>I can lay down on it without it crunching or getting goo or flakes on the furniture and when I sit back up, if it&#x27;s flat, I can simply mold it back into the original position.</li>
            <li>After reading all of the hype about the Gatsby Pink, I suppose my hopes were too high.  </li>
            <li>It is not stiff and lasts all day long.  </li>
            <li>Just purchased the green one recently and will probably use it right before a haircut as it is a lighter feeling</li>
            <li>The only missing star, that they should have this item for a better price because its a little over priced if you ask me.</li>
            <li>I bought it after being disappointed with two Axe Pomades that used to be great and now they can&#x27;t hold any hair of mine.</li>
            <li>I like the product so much I purchased 2 other Gatsby hair wax products for different looks and hair lengths.  </li>
            <li>Only con would be how hard it is to clean out of hair.</li>
            <li>and it gives my hair the proper support without having helmet hair due to too much hairspray.</li>
            <li>Pulled a few strands out applying it the first time.</li>
            <li>I prefer the grey one (for a more matte finish) but the pink one is usually cheaper.</li>
            <li>(at least that is true when it is used sparingly - I have not tried globs of it).</li>
            <li>While my hair IS starting to thin, I still have more than enough to style it.</li>
            <li>and I mean into the night, but I am a special case.</li>
            <li>I was curious about this product because reviews were highly rated for asian hair.</li>
            <li>Recommend this for anybody, but especially those with straight hair and want a different look other than the uniformed look gel gives you.</li>
            <li>I mean cool people and by pajamas</li>
            <li>at least quick to get rid of all the products.</li>
            <li>Immediately I fell in love with the product because not only get my hair up in a very small amount but it just looked fantastic and made my hair look casual.</li>
            <li>Seriously, that whole \\&quot;moving rubber\\&quot; thing is NOT just a clever name here.&lt;br /&gt;Some</li>
            <li>This stuff really, really holds the shape, and a little goes</li>
            <li>me, it was a little too much.</li>
            <li>Scent is a little much for me.  </li>
            <li>but if you have fine thin hair I wouldn&#x27;t expect the same results.  </li>
            <li>This thing has massive hold, a little too much for my tastes.  </li>
            <li>This product holds really well for Asian hair, but my scalp would feel a little bit itchy after I apply this.</li>
            <li>It doesnt flake like other putties, at least not as easily.</li>
            <li>this becomes a huge challenge as my hair grows out even 1 week after getting a hair cut, if you have hair like mine, you know how frustrating it is.  </li>

            <li> Edge is perfect for spikes and those rock star hair types.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Gatsby Moving Rubber seems to work best with hair that is on the drier side of damp.</li>

            <li> Superb quality.</li>

            <li> /&gt;The scent isn&#x27;t great (it smells like rubber--like the name)</li>
            <li> lol</li>
            <li> This is great.</li>
            <li> but once it is on your hair, it works great and holds all day.  </li>
            <li> I have used everything from clay, pomades, and waxes, but nothing comes close to this great product.</li>
            <li> A great product for all the spiky haired guys out there.  </li>
            <li> This is a great balance between holding power and stiffness.  </li>

            <li> It is incredible how good these products are if you use them</li>
            <li> This is actually a great hair product.  </li>
            <li> smell is great.</li>
            <li> Great hold</li>
            <li> This spiky edge hair wax is great for those people have shorter hair and looking for maximum hold.</li>

            <li> I bought it because of the great reviews but it did not wowed me as others have described.</li>
            <li> Great buy.</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> Mandom Gatsby Moving Rubber Spiky Edge is a great product.</li>
            <li> Been using it for 2 years, works great.</li>
            <li> This is  a great product.</li>
            <li> Works great and smell great.</li>

            <li> Magically, my hair looks great!</li>
            <li> Best stuff to use for my hair, holds for most of the day</li>
            <li> your hair will just have a mind of its own, plus because of the thickness of the hair the wax can&#x27;t hold on and will just separate and look like you&#x27;ve never applied any at all!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Axe hair wax, Got2b wax, and many more, but nothing compared to this one!!!!</li>
            <li> It still works but it wasn&#x27;t pleasant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried about a half-dozen products before this one, and this stuff is easily the best.</li>
            <li> I have used all the clays (best for fine hair) and nothing has this hold power and its not a clay.</li>
            <li> Oh, and it smells good - like apples or something.</li>
            <li> They also smell good.</li>
            <li> And good service.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll be good to go :</li>
            <li> The Good</li>
            <li> Smells good.</li>
            <li> Malleable/Pliable is a good way to explain it.   </li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> It smells good and maintains your look all day</li>
            <li> l. Gatsby spiky edge gives a good hold but ni sticky feeling I can put my hands through it.</li>
            <li> This product is really good.</li>
            <li> Dissolves homogeneously, good quality and hold.</li>
            <li> I always loved the moving rubber series.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does not have good hold at all.&lt;br /&gt;Gave</li>
            <li> The packaging is nice and it smells great too.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for something to give your hair a nice hold, this is a great</li>

            <li> worked good for the look i wanted...</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m good.</li>
            <li> This product is good</li>
            <li> Product is a good choice.</li>
            <li> Good product and hold my hair well.</li>
            <li> Ita a prett good product</li>
            <li> It has a really good hold</li>
            <li> it smells so good</li>
            <li> it smells so good and looks like lotion until you put it on your hands and than it because</li>
            <li> When I use this with the right amount, my hair looks product-free (which is great) but it doesn&#x27;t hold perfectly.</li>
            <li> The price point is excellent because most of the products that I have used are 2 to 3 times more.  </li>
            <li> The hold is great better than got2b glued, why although got2b glued gives mw the desired look it gets sticky after a while</li>
            <li> very pleased thank you</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I am very pleased with the product</li>

            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried so many products before!</li>
            <li> I love this!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  </li>
            <li> The best thing is to use condtioner first then shampoo to lubricate the hair to get it out</li>
            <li> , that&#x27;s how you can improve your chances of getting the most out of this nice product!&lt;br /&gt;great job!</li>
            <li> Definitely glad I bought it!</li>
            <li> That is pretty impressive technology in my book.</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> make sure you close the container!</li>
            <li> and i absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> This product is strong, matte, lasts all day, and smells great (like apples).</li>
            <li> Without a doubt, this has strong hold and rlly great for short-medium hair.</li>
            <li> Very unique product!</li>
            <li> Great product, light not &#x27;tacky&#x27; so it is not stuck on your fingers.  </li>
            <li> Now that is another AMAZING thing.</li>
            <li> and it holds amazingly throughout the day.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.</li>
            <li> I use &#x27;ECO Styler&#x27; Great gel,at  $4 for a huge jar that lasts me like 1 to 2 yrs.</li>
            <li> The hold it amazing.</li>
            <li> this product is amazing.  </li>
            <li> For three years, I&#x27;ve been using this amazing wax to style my hair.  </li>
            <li> so if your hair is like mine where it seems to want to do its own thing, then grab this color and take a pass on the purple one..  </li>
            <li> good smell and ok to use it</li>
            <li> /&gt;It smells really nice</li>
            <li> Honestly I was wondering whether or not to buy this item.</li>
            <li> I was expecting it to be better since it has many great reviews.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair nice and in place</li>
            <li> It smells nice.</li>
            <li> Really nice.</li>
            <li> kind of helps it be wasted/used faster.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li> I thought I liked this product until I started noticing it flaking after a bit of manipulation.</li>
            <li> This product does have nice hold, but the flaking is a turn off to the product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Holds for a while and leaves  nice glossy finish.</li>
            <li> best part is there is so much in there that you can use this for months without having to worry about it running out.  </li>
            <li> This is great for my short wavy hair, it keeps it in place wonderfully.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a good trainer for your hair :)</li>
            <li> Works great on short hair, excellent hold, no flaking.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not that effective</li>
            <li> It holds up your hair nicely.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does smell nice, though.</li>
            <li> It is as nice as looks on the picture.</li>
            <li> Good hold through out the day and a very cool</li>
            <li> This product is great if you need super hold.</li>
            <li> It smells good and easy to wash out.</li>
            <li> Good hold, easily refreshed not too greasy.</li>
            <li> This product has a good texture which makes it easy for me to shape my hair.</li>
            <li> This is very strong stuff.</li>
            <li> This product makes styling my hair very easy.  </li>
            <li> Very easy.  </li>
            <li> This wax made it very easy to mold to the style you want.</li>
            <li> Very strong, but flexible.  </li>
            <li> It is also very easy to wash off your hands compared to Claymation.</li>
            <li> It smells pretty good too!</li>
            <li> Best hair wax I have ever used by far!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I&#x27;m able to purchase Gatsby on Amazon!</li>
            <li> This is the best hair product I&#x27;ve used so far!</li>
            <li> good at molding your hair (if you have fine</li>
            <li> It is by far the best and my top favorite hair product I had ever used!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s been the best gel I found so far..</li>
            <li> The best stuff I&#x27;ve used by far and</li>
            <li> this is by far the best line up of hair products i have ever come across</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;it is by far the best for my hair</li>
            <li> It smells amazing and it washes off in the shower quite well unlike most greasy waxes that you get at the store.</li>
            <li> It does sticks to itself to an incredible degree (which is I guess where the whole pliable descriptor comes into play).</li>
            <li> It smells like lightly scented fruit shampoo, but once its on my hair the smell dissipates so it doesn&#x27;t leave a lingering odor, which I loved.  </li>
            <li> excelent product my hair enjoy it great comfort and easy aplication of the product</li>
            <li> but once it&#x27;s on your hair it is so easy to style because it can be moved!</li>
            <li> but it is very fine</li>
            <li> Really, really, really strong all-day hold!</li>
            <li> This is perfect for short spiky hair styles, and the scent is amazing.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve never had a product with such good hold while leaving my hair flexible, and good price!</li>
            <li> First off, it smells great.</li>
            <li> Everything went very smooth.  </li>
            <li> This is definitely the best stuff I have found so far, but it isn&#x27;t perfect for sure.</li>
            <li> Tried it the first time in Tokyo, and I&#x27;ve loved it since then.&lt;br /&gt;People often will also compliment me on its nice smell.</li>
            <li> The shipping was nice n&#x27; easy.</li>
            <li> but it is the strong hold kind, so</li>
            <li> I didnt like this product at first, but i now think it is a good product in its own way.</li>
            <li> A year ago, I got sort of a pomp-undercut (my hair is about four inches on top).</li>
            <li> I much prefer this over Bed Head for Men &amp;#34;Matte Separation Workable Wax&amp;#34; This is a great product.  </li>
            <li> love the product...</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I love how I can always add more product to touch up my hair throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I also love the matte look.</li>
            <li> It is without a doubt, the best hair product for short or even medium length spiky hair.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know why more people in the US don&#x27;t know about it.</li>
            <li> Will be buying more.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not being racist, it just works better.</li>
            <li> Ordered this as gift for my brother and he keeps asking for more.</li>
            <li> I love the Gatsby line of hair products.</li>
            <li> it should be noted that you need to thoroughly wash it out as it seems to cling to your hair a bit better than gel.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for many times.</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have ever used; especially as my hair grows out.  </li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite styling products out there.</li>
            <li> It lasts all day! :]</li>
            <li> will buy it again when I finish this one :)</li>
            <li> I wanted to buy more when it ran out but found out Redken stopped making it.  </li>
            <li> Gatsby, my love, my life, my savior.</li>
            <li> This is actually my favorite.  </li>
            <li> but Gatsby is much better</li>
            <li> And I can rework it throughout the day and it looks better and better.  </li>
            <li> I am a converted product user for sure. &#x3D;-)</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Moving Rubber, mostly Spiky Edge, for about eight years now, ever since discovering it as a Mormon missionary in Japan.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen many reviewers comment on it being \\&quot;too oily,\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I was going to go for the Gatsby \\&quot;Grunge Mat\\&quot; since many people said Spiky Edge was a bit oily, but it isn&#x27;t oily at all.   </li>
            <li> I also use hair spray along with it to assure my hair is perfect the entire day.</li>
            <li> let me more time to another things</li>
            <li> This product is okay.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I switched to suavecito and its much better.</li>
            <li> more words 1</li>
            <li> sure to check on their website because they have a style guide on how to use each type of their product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve got all of my stylists to use them and they love them as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Glad I discovered it.</li>
            <li> You will notice that the hold weakens throughout the day but you can counter by applying more product.  </li>
            <li> given I wouldn&#x27;t call the \\&quot;hold factor\\&quot; a 9/10 (more like a 7/10), I&#x27;m docking by one star.</li>
            <li> but i love the way it works.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll probably be able to find one that fits your hair and hair style.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff as you can refresh your style just by rubbing your hands through your hair.  </li>
            <li> Non-greasy, it won&#x27;t melt in 100-degree heat and most important of all IT HOLDS!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried AXE hair putties and whatnot but Moving Rubber works great on my straight hair.</li>
            <li> I love this &amp;#34;moving rubber&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> hold is ok.</li>
            <li> I had to wash my hair 3 times before it felt like it was mostly out...not all the way out but mostly out.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love the product and love the strawberry yogurt smell</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll for sure be buying this again.</li>
            <li> , I can keep touching it up...</li>
            <li> This product is more matte.</li>
            <li> My husband husband loves it and it doesn&#x27;t look greasy. :)</li>
            <li> It works great on both real and the synthetic hair.  </li>
            <li> My favorite hair product ever is no longer made, but this one is my favorite that I can still get.</li>
            <li> It leaves a bit of a residue , you may have to shampoo more than once.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll use Gatsby more sparingly for occasions.</li>
            <li> Love the hold I get from this product.</li>
            <li> Love it~</li>
            <li> However, like many reviews have mentioned..</li>
            <li> I try to go for the textured/tassled look up top, and try to keep the sides closer to my head...</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> one was just okay.</li>
            <li> but I found that it worked the best when left out overnight to harden.</li>
            <li> Best for Asian hair?</li>
            <li> So, if you&#x27;re more of a cubicle type of guy</li>
            <li> better value</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this brand!  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Love this wax.</li>
            <li> glad that I got</li>
            <li> American Crew Fiber, Hanz de fuko, would work best for thicker hair but not mine.</li>
            <li> The best product prior to Gatsby&#x27;s was [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> LOVE the consistency of the product itself...</li>
            <li> I have a buddy who lives in Osaka Japan and swears by this brand (as well as most Japanese-based hair products).</li>
            <li> Its better than gel</li>
            <li> but I have had better.</li>
            <li> I think a putty would&#x27;ve been a more appropriate moniker.</li>
            <li> When you rub the moving rubber in your fingers and palms it becomes more like tooth paste</li>
            <li> use sparingly might give you better</li>
            <li> But, otherwise I love the product.</li>
            <li> Keep that in mind I should have researched that part a bit more before committing to buy.</li>
            <li> Better than gel, moose, hair spray etc.</li>
            <li> If I needed to I could just add more dabs to my hair to make it spikier.  </li>
            <li> I love Gatsby and I have many colors.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li> He says it&#x27;s so easy to work with, it rinses CLEAN without residue, and it smells good.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m sure that doesn&#x27;t help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the spikes magically stands up.  </li>
            <li> Ron, if you will try Spiky Edge, you&#x27;d have to add one more product to that list.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than Snake Juice.</li>
            <li> Gatsby Moving Rubber Spiky Edge is my favorite wax to use for my hair.</li>
            <li> this product is amazing&lt;br /&gt;i might buy more for my friends as gift</li>
            <li> Edge\\&quot; wax has been my favorite wax for awhile</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely buy again! :D</li>
            <li> I think this is something I get better with the more time I use it.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Most of the reviews and I am assuming purchasers, are men.  </li>
            <li> i have a fo-hawk and i love this stuff.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t a strong odor to it, and it washes out very easily.  </li>
            <li> also this hair wax does not make your hair look oily or greasy and you dont need much to style your hair because this wax is very effective.</li>
            <li> Very unique texture, unlike anything I have ever tried before</li>
            <li> Perfect for men who are looking for stylish hair, but don&#x27;t put it too much ;)</li>
            <li> : I haven&#x27;t tried the grey one, yet, but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s just as awesome as the rest.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Holds great and keeps hair looking good all day long.  </li>
            <li> To sum this product up I would say its a great purchase if you like that more natural look, but if you can&#x27;t take some time out to put a bit more effort into washing your hair</li>
            <li> It also smells pretty good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty good product.</li>
            <li> Probably the best product I&#x27;ve used in a long time.</li>
            <li> Really good product for those who make their hair style very day!</li>
            <li> Loved it at first</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a clean cut look, use this!</li>
            <li> Best of the bunch, I bought most of the Gatsby products but I like my hair pretty short, Asian hair, this stuff is the best of the lot for me.  </li>
            <li> itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: affordable, super strong but pliable hold, don&#x27;t need a lot for effective hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> It does leave your hair feeling sticky but overall it is a very good product.</li>
            <li> Provided very good texture for short hair.</li>
            <li> for short to short-medium hair is very very good, just apply it like the instructions say, just a little bit, if u noticed that need or want more strong strenght to ur hairsatyle, aply a bit more trougn all the hair moving ur fingers into it, and u will have excellent results.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a product that felt light in my hair, but was able to manage my shorter hairs, which can be quite stubborn.  </li>
            <li> Works better than that cheap Axe hair wax stuff.</li>
            <li> WoW Excellent~~ Thank You so much!</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a nice fresh scent.</li>
            <li> I honestly didn&#x27;t even need 2 finger worth of it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good if you want that really really spiky effect.</li>
            <li> Fantastic and very unique.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a pretty good amount inside, and shouldn&#x27;t need more than a couple finger scoops worth.</li>
            <li> Likewise, if your hair is easily tamed then go for the weaker of the two (the purple).    </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s easy to wash off both from your hands and your hair.</li>
            <li> , do it well, are easy to work with, don&#x27;t leave flakes and wash out relatively easily.</li>
            <li> Came packaged great, same as most companies.</li>
            <li> and then when it dries (very quickly) I have fab</li>
            <li> The ordering and buying was easy.  </li>
            <li> .. stays on all day and easy to come off in shampoo</li>
            <li> easy is it to work into the hair?  </li>
            <li> it wash out easily?  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a hair product that holds strong and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> However, it does not flake, and can easily be adjusted throughout the day without loss of holding power.</li>
            <li> It does not wash off that easily like he said...</li>
            <li> Easily applied  </li>
            <li> /&gt; - easy to style&lt;</li>
            <li> has proven to have as strong of a hold.  </li>
            <li> holds strong.</li>
            <li> The main thing that bothers me is if you use a good amount in your hair you&#x27;ll have to shampoo twice and condition</li>
            <li> Stuff is strong.</li>
            <li> strong hold and flexible on the hair</li>
            <li> cause it so strong of a hold.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s strong, yet doesn&#x27;t make your hair look greasy or feel crunchy.</li>
            <li> Strong hold as advertised.</li>
            <li> Purple is strong with shine.  </li>
            <li> now, I&#x27;m going to stick with Paul Mitchell Men Reformer Strong Hold/Matte Finish Texturizer for Men.  </li>
            <li> A great hair wax, gives a long hold, doesn&#x27;t shine, and smells pretty good.</li>
            <li> Non greasy but strong and smells fine.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s very mild and light, so</li>
            <li> It washes out just fine for me.</li>
            <li> If you follow exactly what he&#x27;s doing, it works perfectly and only takes a minute or two.  </li>
            <li> then it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> Use less that you think, and rub in palms until its gone basically, and it works great!</li>
            <li> Cheap and work super well!</li>
            <li> Overall, I am very pleased with the product!</li>
            <li> I mix a little with the grunge Gatsby wax, seems to be the best combo for me.  </li>
            <li> this is most definitely worth a try.  </li>
            <li> Both products worked great for my hair, but I found that the Gatsby lasted a bit longer even though it is a smaller size, 2.8oz vs 3.3oz for the Goldwell.  </li>
            <li> Works out great, Spyky Edge is for upper medium strength tug on hair.</li>
            <li> This choice is great for short to medium length hair.</li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s a great product</li>
            <li> I enjoy this product, I don&#x27;t even need to use hairspray.</li>
            <li> i enjoy this product</li>
            <li> It has a pliable, flexible, matte looking hold perfect for creating pieced, spiked, messy hairstyles.</li>
            <li> Great lasting holding power</li>
            <li> Overall, this is a great product.  </li>
            <li> Gatsby is just great  for asian hair.  </li>
            <li> Works great on my short hair.</li>
            <li> Over all, I enjoy the product.</li>
            <li> may also have mentioned that this product has a light scent.</li>
            <li> It works with great with short/medium length asian hair.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;and find this one is available in Amazon&lt;br /&gt;Get</li>
            <li> I heard this was a great product for asian hair, but it works well in mine as well.  </li>
            <li> Such great Quality...!&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> Overall this is great</li>
            <li> It is neither too heavy nor too light, which is just perfect for my short-medium length hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> product is good, it makes your hair look like it has natural volume</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not quite sure why it gets such good ratings.</li>
            <li> Washes out clean however, best to use deep clean shampoos or dove Fresh Clean 2 in 1 to rid of any build ups.  </li>
            <li> It drys pretty quickly and holds amazingly well.  </li>
            <li> When I started sending pics home to my girlfriend, she noticed right away that my hair looked much better.  </li>
            <li> Very good stuff, holds extremely well even with curly hair.</li>
            <li> And fast shipping!!!</li>
            <li> it is exactly the same as the one from China.&lt;br /&gt;I am really happy and satisfied with it, thank you</li>
            <li> Great product but unfortunately not made for people with natural curly hair.</li>
            <li> If you have anime hair or a major hawk or liberty spike situation, this would be a good product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went from a short messy hairdo to the now more popular undercut, and Gatsby Moving Rubber has held both hairstyles the best.  </li>
            <li> I was using this with medium longer hair and while does not have a strong stiff hold, it is still a very good flexible product for creating texture and form without shine or gloss.</li>
            <li> Bonus, it smells like fresh apples!</li>
            <li> Always worth the buy!</li>
            <li> I wash my hair first with bar soap, which works better than shampoo at getting the wax out, then follow up with shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Provides great hold and does what it was meant to do and keeps doing it long after the day has ended.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but totally worth it!</li>
            <li> but each have a unique set of pros and cons.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for long hair.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m still using the original container)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Superior to Axe products (not hard to believe) and the price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best product I have used for my short spiky hair.</li>
            <li> Overall I liked them all, but Moving Rubber is my favorite by far.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t strong strong enought to hold certain spots of my hair</li>
            <li> It works best for that fine asian hair, and it has pretty good hold for short hair, and the hold is good for something little longer length.</li>
            <li> Good product for the price, unique smell,it is different, but I like it.</li>
            <li> This product is very good at defining hair spikes and because of that hair spray should not be used with this product it’ll would be redundant to do so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Really good product, helps give me a messy look very easily.</li>
            <li> works good but wont last for all day</li>
            <li> I use this + the blue one to keep a good sheen and hold for my hair.</li>
            <li> After a full day of work its still holding.</li>
            <li> In this case it&#x27;s cool, since it IS meant for men after all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I like it, it get the job done, the only complain is that you HAVE to wash your hair, with a good shampoo</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m able to create waves with my straight hair by just applying this product and twisting .</li>
            <li> This was is good for making your short hair stand up without looking greasy or hardened.</li>
            <li> I have every colour of Moving Rubber there is and can&#x27;t say enough good things about them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t say enough good things about these products.</li>
            <li> It has a sweet scent.  </li>
            <li> I just absolutely love how fast the item gets to me.</li>
            <li> Really good for asian hair.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s true.  </li>
            <li> One more thing this products dries relatively fast so when you’re taking the wax you need</li>
            <li> Does not leave flakes and has no bad smell.</li>
            <li> Not bad though.</li>
            <li> It;s easy to apply and not too shiny, perfect for straight, course, unbelievably damaged hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many many many other hair gels and waxes.</li>
            <li> This holds insanely strong and if I apply a bit too much, my hair begins to hold and clump like glue!</li>
            <li> It is pretty easy to tell when this product is used however.</li>
            <li> First and foremost I Don&#x27;t give out five stars easily, If I could I&#x27;d give this product a 4.5 out of 5.   </li>
            <li> Washing out the wax is pretty easy.</li>
            <li> Perfect for spiking hair and it stays soft enough at first to style then dries and holds.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Gatsby for many years and there are some minor flaws but can be fix to enjoy this product even more.</li>
            <li> Very great product :) holds my hair up keeps it smelling like green apple and overall a really great product to give you that anime or asian look;)</li>
            <li> Also, it dries quickly which helps to create volume.</li>
            <li> i have thick,and coarse Asian hair and this product is perfect for me.</li>
            <li> but it goes away quickly after putting it in your hair.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m lucky, I know  ppl that has that problem  though.</li>
            <li> 2nd, I LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> OK so first thing&#x27;s first, im</li>
            <li> It is super sticky.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the fact that you don&#x27;t need to use very much product to get your hair to do what you want.</li>
            <li> For years I used Alterna Hair Concrete which did a really good job of holding my short Chinese hair, lol.  </li>
            <li> Generally I have trouble finding a good gel, but Gatsby is AMAZING!</li>
            <li> gift item for guys and girls who want to look fabulous ;)</li>
            <li> That works great too, but I definitely prefer Gatsby over got2b mainly because of the texture it gives your hair.</li>
            <li> This is especially good for controlling shorter asian hair that seems to grow straight out and not down.</li>
            <li> Good, reliable product which will hold your hair all day long !</li>
            <li> But it is a slight inconvenience to an otherwise great product.</li>
            <li> Great for sculpting a variety of styles and when your hair starts to lose it&#x27;s style, just slightly we hands and rework into hair to reactivate the product.  </li>
            <li> I would say if you have strong sturdy hair this product would really work well for you</li>
            <li> The two problems I have with it is although this is a strong point for some it makes your hair real matte to the point where it seems like your hair might be dyed</li>
            <li> Pretty good for my asian hair.</li>
            <li> If my hair is too dry, the wax doesn&#x27;t give me as good of a hold.</li>
            <li> It is by far hands down the best hair styling product I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Works exactly as promised!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for years and at my mid 40&#x27;s, I still love it!  </li>
            <li> A little bit sticky but does a great job on my faux hawk hair style.</li>
            <li> Still, give it a shot if you have short hair, it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> It did feel relatively light in my hair without too much residue or gunkiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> its very creamy &amp; smooth.</li>
            <li> Looks like no product, and my hair is so calm and behaved you</li>
            <li> This Mandom Moving Rubber does the job, is economically priced, and is made without parabens.</li>
            <li> its nothing near what gel or hair spray does.&lt;br /&gt;Gatsby products are fantastic!</li>
            <li> be too powerful of a product for you</li>
            <li> wanna try got2b if it is in fact that powerful</li>
            <li> This stuff keeps your hair looking freshly done.</li>
            <li> It was worth a try but oily and not my type of wax</li>
            <li> I ordered this not only for my own hair but to style the wigs I use for cosplay.  </li>
            <li> Best hair product for straight thick hair.</li>
            <li> My hair looks awesome and my friends are always curious how it stays up for the entire day</li>
            <li> Its styling power will not diminish as the day goes on, leaving you with a freshly styled look all day.</li>
            <li> B000V2ACHI GATSBY MOVING RUBBER WILD SHAKE Hair Wax, 80g/2.8oz]] and Spiky Edge for the shorter hairs to give out a more define look.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I love it so far.</li>
            <li> Have some fun with your hair.</li>
            <li> Overall great hold with the natural look.</li>
            <li> So far I really love it.  </li>
            <li> Would prefer a more masculine smell.</li>
            <li> a dime size on the palm, and smooth into the hair.&lt;br /&gt;Sides, back, top, front.</li>
            <li> Usually I love opening a new container and using it for the first time.  </li>
            <li> Which is great in my book since I can&#x27;t stand hair care products that make my hair as stiff as a rock.   </li>
            <li> : Great styling ability - even with my stiff hair, it can sculpt and hold its shape.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than anything I&#x27;ve tried at retail stores, and about equal to Aveda Control Paste without the high price, and you get more per ounce.  </li>
            <li> If you watch the video on the desktop site (doesn&#x27;t show up on the mobile site for some reason) to the right of all the pictures, it shows a guy applying it to his hair.  </li>
            <li> use this product right after a haircut then switch to the purple one when my hair gets longer.</li>
            <li> So then, this product seemed like it was right up my alley.</li>
            <li> I have tried many other hair spiking product agents, and no other has even come close to how good this one is.</li>
            <li> This product is only slightly less strong than that, but it is still strong enough to get my hair to spike up and stay that way and best of all</li>
            <li> Gatsby isn&#x27;t a solid like the hair stick, which makes application very easy.  </li>
            <li> I think Wild Shake is better if you need a bit more pliable action or not quite so much hold.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best hair product I&#x27;ve ever tried - you get amazing hold with only a tiny amount so the little tub goes a really long way, and it even smells nice!</li>
            <li> Though even my hair is so fine it still kind of falls a little bit</li>
            <li> It is harder to wash out and not quite as soft, but the best I have tried so far.</li>
            <li> In my attempt to use more natural, non-cancer-causing products, I found the whole line of Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soaps, and this Mandom Gatsby Moving Rubber.</li>
            <li> But, for hold, texture, non greasy/shiny, and doesn&#x27;t wear off at the end of the day, this is great, especially for my asian hair.</li>
            <li> This is really a great product, especially if you wear your hair short and just use your hands to shape your hair and style it.  </li>
            <li> This makes your hair easy to form and forget, it naturally get imbedded into the hair and you shape it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Asian and my hair sticks out and this does a great job of taming my hair especially on the sides.</li>
            <li> Short hair really doesn&#x27;t flatter a man when he puts on a suit or even a nice dress shirt.  </li>
            <li> and super fast shipping.</li>
            <li> It is very light yet where it does not bring the hair down yet holds hair strong.  </li>
            <li> It still keeps hair looking great after sleeping on it all night long - just style it again or add a little more.  </li>
            <li> I wasted money on many, many, many products trying to duplicate the same results.</li>
            <li> They mold the hair fine but take away the natural shine and make hair look like it needs washing.</li>
            <li> I got this to pack in with other stuff I needed more to get the over $25 free ship.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair (not thin, but fine) that ranges from wavy to curly on different parts of my head.</li>
            <li> It also comes in a cool little case and smells nice.</li>
            <li> Great hold without making your hair hard.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t want to put too much you&#x27;ll lose texture and definition to your hair, it&#x27;s better to work with a little amount and add more if needed too.</li>
            <li> Good spikes easy to be made and presumably slicked back hair or other styles</li>
            <li> I first bought this product when I was in Hong Kong a year ago.</li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s different for most ppl.</li>
            <li> Work better on Asian hair</li>
            <li> The PINK Rubber Spiky Edge Hair Wax is definitely nice.</li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t aware of the line for women.</li>
            <li> I have been using tigi wax stick, crew wax and various forms of powders (Sexy Hair Big Sexy Hair Powder Play, Osis + Dust</li>
            <li> Can wear wet if you like that look.&lt;br /&gt;Con: kind of bulky to put into travel bag.</li>
            <li> The wax is a lot different from most wax products on the market and it does have a rubbery feel to it once your hair is styled.  </li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve had it, I have only had to use the product that gets stuck to the top cover of the container.</li>
            <li> I plan on trying more Gatsby products in the future.</li>
            <li> ive tried MANY different hair products but this product went beyond my expectations.</li>
            <li> This is a great product to try at least once.</li>
            <li> also makes your hair feel pretty</li>
            <li> Holds my hair pretty well.</li>
            <li> This does exactly that.</li>
            <li> ; moniker is never truer than it is with this product because that&#x27;s exactly how it felt like: covering my hair in rubber.</li>
            <li> but I used mine to do a side part hair style and it worked pretty great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the hold consistent?</li>
            <li> I have used Crew Fiber (blue top) for years.</li>
            <li> This isnt quite the same as it is more creamy</li>
            <li> Great for my thick hair.</li>
            <li> Once I came back to the States I was pleased to find out that Amazon sells Gatsby products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This stuff is exactly what the doctor ordered.</li>
            <li> but the real killer is trying to get it out!</li>
            <li> This is my first time buying any wax products for my hair</li>
            <li> I am actually going to experiment with more of them since they can be inter used and serve specialized purposes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many different hair wax products.</li>
            <li> I love it, and will definitely buy it again!</li>
            <li> To wash it out I first shampoo my hair, condition it and run a comb through it as I&#x27;m conditioning it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much better than American Brands.</li>
            <li> Like many others, I have tried lots of different hair gels and waxes but none like the Gatsby spyky edge.</li>
            <li> And if I add more, it just feels gross and looks like I rubbed vaseline on my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No need of hairspray since Spiky Edge holds up pretty well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You should always make sure to close the lid properly after use.</li>
            <li> It manages my short hairs better and is equally non-gunky most of the time.  </li>
            <li> Glued Spiking Glue is water resistant (sweat resistant) and provides all day hold even in this hot and humid weather.</li>
            <li> Yes, I&#x27;m a spiky haired asian fella. :)</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is my first experience with Gatsby</li>
            <li> Hair stays up the whole day!</li>
            <li> So one of the techniques that I’ve learned to deal with this problem is to either comb it while washing your hair or wash it first then</li>
            <li> I recognize that many of the people who like the Moving Rubber have different hair than mine, so I&#x27;m just sharing my experience, not disagreeing with theirs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works great for my thick hair.  </li>
            <li> My first try</li>
            <li> I first found out about this product while I was in Japan.  </li>
            <li> I was hesitant at first as there were so many different types that I was overwhelmed.  </li>
            <li> A+ Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Mandoms Gatsby wax and UNO Wax by Shiseido are the only brands of wax I have used in my life that I truly love and works how I want it too.  </li>
            <li> It is the first wax I came across that reliably held my hair</li>
            <li> Overall, I love this stuff</li>
            <li> ... while it worked good, there was a few drawbacks.</li>
            <li> : Really good stiff hold yet flexible.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Gatsby products are all-around good for styling without the mess and the \\&quot;greasy\\&quot; look.</li>
            <li> First of all the pink gatsby has very strong hold</li>
            <li> For the past couple of years I was using crew creams and they did a perfect job, but I didn&#x27;t really like the fact that it left your hair a bit shiny, even the ones that advertised making your hair look &amp;#34;matte&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Distributes nice and evenly due to consistency.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Asian and have been having a hard time finding the perfect hair styling product.  </li>
            <li> , it smells great like green apple and no shine with natural looks.</li>
            <li> That has a much stronger hold than that of the pink kind.</li>
            <li> The product is cheap and you are definitely getting your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> In turn, you will get a lot of crunchiness and the \\&quot;wet look\\&quot; - effectively defeating the whole matte theme of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have thick asian hair and it is perfect.</li>
            <li> I tried a more expensive version of Gatsby and loved it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many, many different types of hair wax and gels, and this tops every single one of them.</li>
            <li> , very straight, like my side burns grows out straight type.</li>
            <li> I stumbled upon this when my previous hair wax ran out during a trip to Japan, and the first use was an AMAZING revelation.</li>
            <li> At first I made the mistake of applying too much at once</li>
            <li> I have tried out pretty much every gatsby product out there</li>
            <li> Even after 2 days I could just fluff up my hair, retouch with a flat iron and it looked great.  </li>
            <li> Pretty much what everyone says about this....</li>
            <li> My hair is about 5-6 inches long up top</li>
            <li> The best product for my asian, thick, straight hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- technique sensitive (which is true for any hair styling products)</li>
            <li> I have tried many types of gel and even mousse, but this is the best.&lt;br /&gt;Strong hold, no flaking, no discoloration, lasts for a decent amount of time, and you only need a little.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Works very well, I&#x27;ve been jumping around different hair gels, pomades, and creams trying to find the right fit.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyways, I will buy a fresh new one and update this review.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and doesn&#x27;t make your hair feel gross or gunky.</li>
            <li> I prefer the Gatsby Wild Shake to this for my hair, but that&#x27;s because I am not looking for the super hold that this product provides.</li>
            <li> I believe the hold is slightly better if you apply it on hair that is dry.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, this is a fantastic hair product and I&#x27;m willing to only order this to style my hair.</li>
            <li> but they where sold out, none the less I liked this product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s strong, so expect it to feel sticky, especially after you apply it</li>
            <li> Strong hold, low shine.</li>
            <li> It has a strong hold, gives your hair that extra point.  </li>
            <li> I chose this because others described it as having strong, lasting hold that isn&#x27;t oily or flaky.</li>
            <li> It is strong enough hold my hair for 8+ hrs and does not make my hair look shiny like some products.</li>
            <li> look and this stuff certainly did the trick.</li>
            <li> The pink one is best for short hair while I used the purple when I have medium to long hair.</li>
            <li> but when you rub it between  your hands it turns sticky and slightly pink/white, but surprisingly goes on clear once you work it into your hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also pretty strong and can hold your hair in desirable position for a long time.</li>
            <li> Amazing how little of this product i needed to keep my hair in place!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and you can even mess with  your hair and still be able to style it back to the way it was without applying more of the product.</li>
            <li> and you can get that clean cut asian style hair or a pretty gnarly grungy look.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m from Sweden and it has been really hard to find a good hair wax product that doesn&#x27;t feel too unnatural when applied.</li>
            <li> Product in good order, came a little late but overall great</li>
            <li> However, it did add that classic Asian pop idol texture to my hair, which was new and interesting.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s apparently a huge different between the 9 to 10 on this</li>
            <li> I got this for my boyfriend and he really likes it.</li>
            <li> price isn&#x27;t too shabby although it used to be much cheaper</li>
            <li> The pink one is my favorite.</li>
            <li> Dries fast, residue fades away, is a bit sticky.</li>
            <li> Using a quarter-sized dollop of this stuff in my hair after showering and towel drying my hair keeps my hair in check and allows me to spike, gently tousle, or give my hair some texture.</li>
            <li> Without any product in my hair, I have Brillo Pad hair - it&#x27;s really poofy.</li>
            <li> Hold - Not so much.  </li>
            <li> The price is much steeper for the Goldwell as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Edge/Red(looks more Pink) ---</li>
            <li> Works really well</li>
            <li> It holds very well and shapes my hair really well.  </li>
            <li> The hair wax works really well.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really do anything for my hair.</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t really style it a lot with this wax.</li>
            <li> I need my hair product to set fast or</li>
            <li> I appreciate it because i have so much control in the application and disbursement</li>
            <li> real well it gets my hair to go directions</li>
            <li> me using a bit too much product.</li>
            <li> so a need to be fast while styling helped me.</li>
            <li> look no further try this.the smell is great like green apples very fruity .</li>
            <li> The delievery is really fast.</li>
            <li> you dont need much, about a fingertip spread over your palm will do.</li>
            <li> It does not take a lot to do what it is suppose to do, and it does it very well.  </li>
            <li> This dries to wax somewhat and gives it more strength (although it is slightly harder to work through your hair).</li>
            <li> The product is very matted with no shine at all.</li>
            <li> In a world of having to use too much of something</li>
            <li> I DON&#x27;T USE MUCH AND HAVE THIS STOCKED UP.  </li>
            <li> It does make your hair sticky (of course), but it doesn&#x27;t really make it look greasy anything.</li>
            <li> Very unnatural.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hold much faster when you&#x27;re exposed to moisture.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Spiky Edge does not provide that much shine, unless you apply a ton of it (which you don&#x27;t need at all).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This stuff helps my hair so much.</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff.</li>
            <li> Works very well on medium (4-5in) hair.</li>
            <li> Definitely reasonable for its &amp;#60;$10 price tag.</li>
            <li> applying it is straight forward...</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t really look like you have any product in your hair.</li>
            <li> keep the shape for my hair throughout the whole day&lt;br</li>
            <li> really well</li>
            <li> It even seems to work well in all of our humidity (south Louisiana - really sticky).  </li>
            <li> So I don&#x27;t really need it specifically for that.</li>
            <li> It really helps control my hair, and give it texture.</li>
            <li> This REALLY holds your hair.</li>
            <li> My hair sticks straight out from my head even at 3-4 inches in length.  </li>
            <li> I look like a punk rocker that used a whole can of hair spray even without any hair product.  </li>
            <li> It really is like using &#x27;moving rubber&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work very well on my hair.</li>
            <li> it gives it a much nicer look while maintaining the hair style you want without the greasy look</li>
            <li> sometimes use it as well and really like the smell of it.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s available at your local CVS and</li>
            <li> I can even wet my hands and style it even more.</li>
            <li> Have straight hair.</li>
            <li> So thinning and straightening your hair can really give you that look you&#x27;ve always wanted.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this stuff.</li>
            <li> being said, I found the whole experience of wearing the product to be akin to slathering my head with an air and moisture-tight helmet of semi-liquid latex.</li>
            <li> so I really know how this product works.</li>
            <li> It really makes my style work.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much.  </li>
            <li> Really like this stuff.  </li>
            <li> It doesnt really leave my hair feeling greasy and almost feels as if there is nothing in my hair and</li>
            <li> Holds very well without looking to shiny.  </li>
            <li> I am very displeased with this.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper on Amazon than anywhere else.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast too.</li>
            <li> For some reason, our hair structure is just really think.</li>
            <li> Does not flake unless you put too much on.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> it holds really  </li>
            <li> really well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably keep using my old gel more on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> If you are looking to get a wax that can be applied easily and with moderate proportions than I would highly recommend this wax.</li>
            <li> I wish it was bigger because he goes through these pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Based on a quick estimate with this, my first tub, I&#x27;d say this should last me around three months or so.</li>
            <li> i had tried quite a few other hair styling products before discovering GMR but this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> I have normal Asian hair and it works fine</li>
            <li> This has better hold and control than any other product in the US.  </li>
            <li> It washed off better than other waxes and it has an apple smell.</li>
            <li> day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other products like Got2Be and many other gels that I use just make me spikes look clumpy and make me look like im thinning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many other hair styling products.</li>
            <li> While other products might harden when set, this stuff kinda sets your hair, but then you&#x27;re still able to move it and reposition at will.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not disappointed, and I definitely got a bargain; but seeing this product called &amp;#34;hair wax&amp;#34</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a bit pricey, (2) it has a whole bunch of parabens, which is my main reason for moving away from Crew products.</li>
            <li> much do you need to get a decent hold?  </li>
            <li> I had really high hopes with this product, but it didn&#x27;t really meet my expectations.  </li>
            <li> It has somewhat of a shine if you put too much, but a little is good enough to make your hair stick.</li>
            <li> Tried both of them and this hands down beats Murray&#x27;s due to the fact that it&#x27;s much easier to clean out and it smells rather nice</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s strange to see it for this price, but it is fantastic stuff.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make your hair rigid, but has enough to control the shape, true to its &amp;#34;moving rubber&amp;#34; name.  </li>
            <li> Most days, my hair was hit-or-miss depending on how much product I used, whether my hair was a bit wet, how far Jupiter was from Mars...</li>
            <li> This helps you to get a cool asian hair styled look.</li>
            <li> This stuff works and it works without making your hair feel gross to the ladies (wife in my case, full disclosure).</li>
            <li> and it has to be my favorite hair product hands down.</li>
            <li> probably the best i&#x27;ve had, i&#x27;ve used American Crew Fiber, Got2be Glued and a few other waxes.</li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s not exactly sticky per se, it is...tacky and heavy are probably the best words I can think of to describe the consistency of it on my hair (even using only a dab).</li>
            <li> If you like this manufacturer and need more hold (for slightly longer hair), check out Grunge Mat.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very stick and easy to wash off from your hands after you are done.</li>
            <li> Works great for my thick spikey Asian hair!</li>
            <li> Fantastic product for Messy Hairstyles, Up Spiky and just generally fun moving styles.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t even dipped my fingers into the main portion of the jar container.</li>
            <li> I did notice that this particular product seems to lose</li>
            <li> I mainly use HdF Claymation and while it worked, I had to use quite a bit and then douse it in hairspray to keep my hair locked in place.</li>
            <li> usually wash my hair out with a cheaper shampoo first, then wash it again with better shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> ( this particular one has lasted over a month)</li>
            <li> It acts it&#x27;s name and is highly malleable.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this hair wax to my friends.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> High quality</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend to my friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I decided to check this product out because of its popularity and consistently high rating.</li>
            <li> If you want more of a wavy, natural look try the other moving rubbers out.</li>
            <li> holds well, and i&#x27;ve left the container open a few times for a day, but if i close it, it&#x27;s back to normal, and works again like new :D</li>
            <li> had very very short hair when i started using this product, but to my comfort it was really good, nice smell, but don&#x27;t abuse it, don&#x27;t put too much because you are going to have an undesired result, so as long as you go little by little testing how it works for you</li>
            <li> the internet for hundreds of tutorials on how to use the product, not only you will find useful tips, but also a chuckle and</li>
            <li> It worked pretty well but left my hair frizzy but held really well.  </li>
            <li> Only thing I didn&#x27;t love was this product took a long time to ship.</li>
            <li> smell is sweet (not masculine) and overbearing for me being a guy</li>
            <li> I took two finger worth of the product and thought it wouldn&#x27;t be enough but started rubbing it in my hand and ran it through my hair.</li>
            <li> It literally turned rock solid in the jar and pretty much glued itself to the container.</li>
            <li> My hair length ranges from very short on the sides to 2-3 inches long on top.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely not just for men even though I rarely see reviews by females and there are no females on the Gatsby site.</li>
            <li> Spiky Edge has a pretty strong hold when applying to your palms it tends to pull your hair especially if it&#x27;s medium short hair o_O!</li>
            <li> This is available at the local Japanese supermarket, but it&#x27;s more convenient for me to have it delivered to my house by Amazon, and it&#x27;s slightly cheaper to boot.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t as greasy as many of the typical ones and it looks quite natural.</li>
            <li> If the hold isn&#x27;t strong enough for you, I recommend leaving the container open for a day or two.</li>
            <li> Strong enough to hold for an entire day.</li>
            <li> A strong, dry, and &amp;quot;rubbery&amp;quot; hold that lasts all day while retaining much of its initial pliability.</li>
            <li> Only issue is taht on hot days i do tend to notice it being a little more oily.</li>
            <li> So in short, Gatsby Pink for short (mega short) OR longer hair (up to 3\\&quot;)works wonders and is great for hold and flexibility.</li>
            <li> What also great is that you can reshape your hair anytime of the day by just a little water, moist your palms and rub it on your hair, a few brush strokes and your set.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The pink version is normally for people with shorter hair and is the one most widely used, there are many other versions also</li>
            <li> I live in japan, and I can buy this product for a slim 210...</li>
            <li> new cause</li>
            <li> This stuff lets you take your hair to new heights, which is what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> My husband cannot live without this product.</li>
            <li> even earlier, I&#x27;ve yet to find a product that can work with my unruly Asian coarse hair that could easily be made into a paint brush!</li>
            <li> The subtle apple scent is a nice touch.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a white guy with thin brown hair and this stuff works great for my hair style</li>
            <li> I tried most of the options from the pink, to purple, and even the blue gel.</li>
            <li> The wax is pretty water resistant/sweat resistant once it dries, but when first applying it, do not get it wet</li>
            <li> Has a really subtle scent and looks nice.</li>
            <li> It works very well with my straight asian hair.</li>
            <li> Definitely will hold your hair the whole day, maybe hairspray will help to keep hairstyle in place the whole day but its an option.</li>
            <li> I sometimes steal a little from him to tame flyaways, and it works great.</li>
            <li> This product was made for Asian hair (very straight hair).</li>
            <li> reason I like their products is that they doesn&#x27;t feel stiff like glue or sticky as pomades, yet able to shape your hair looking natural; it is no wonder it is called \\&quot;moving rubber\\</li>
            <li> I only need to use a little and it leaves my hair nice and soft, but styled all day.  </li>
            <li> I also prefer this over American Crew Fiber, which was the first product I started off with before moving on to Bed Head and</li>
            <li> Packaging - exactly the same as shown.  </li>
            <li> No weird next day product feel to your hair, no need to wash your hair twice to get it out.  </li>
            <li> I know its meant for men but the first time I heard about this was back in 2010</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought my first container (Spiky Edge) back in 2010 and still use Gatsby products to day.</li>
            <li> As you can see on most of the videos or tutorials: ALL YOU NEED IS A SMALL AMOUNT</li>
            <li> Excited to try their other products as well.</li>
            <li> It actually looks very matte!</li>
            <li> been using this product for almost a year now, been always trying out other products, to see if i like it better, but ive been always coming back to this product!!.</li>
            <li> If you do have very short hair, most of the above criteria will not matter in which case it actually is a solid contender.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> case is like heatproof (like i put it in my apron while pushing carts as a bagger in about 90 degrees), my bed hair looks better than what I usually try to style my hair for.</li>
            <li> up&amp;#34; look, go for the Wild Shake!</li>
            <li> I am looking for exactly the same product I bring from China</li>
            <li> Like right after applying it theres tiny white flakes everywhere for the whole</li>
            <li> Hair stays in place except in unusually harsh conditions with a more natural, matte appearance and is relatively soft, not stiff and sticky.</li>
            <li> and I recommend it for anyone who have very fine hair but grows in really thick.</li>
            <li> My problem then was that American products with great hold left my hair stiff and flaky, and stuff that was softer left my hair slimy and</li>
            <li> This is pretty much what I expected.</li>
            <li> The product itself has a pleasant, but faint apple smell.</li>
            <li> I have relatively fine hair as well, and this helps give it a little volume.</li>
            <li> With a little more than average shampoo than you normally use will do the trick.e the lid!!!</li>
            <li> I was previously using American Crew Fiber but wasn&#x27;t totally satisfied.</li>
            <li> Less is more in this case as if you apply too much it gets harder to style your hair.  </li>
            <li> I love the fact that I can mess with my hair and reshape it well after initially putting it in my hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also seen many reviewers talking about how hard it is to wash out.</li>
            <li> product holds well but easily catches lint and other white stuff in your hair.  </li>
            <li> It has the same hold as Bed Head, but it is MUCH softer, and it also lasts all day.</li>
            <li> its a real deal and makes my short hair stand out</li>
            <li> Wild and spiky</li>
            <li> rise/Green --- Soft and volume/ Medium to medium long&lt;</li>
            <li> Motion/Yellow --- Natural &amp; nuance / Medium</li>
            <li> , the real test is the next day when you wake up and this product passed the test with flying colors.  </li>
            <li> It keeps my hair looking natural as well and its still touchable.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t naturally go</li>
            <li> Ive had this product for a couple of months now, I dont like using products that make my hair looks greasy or too incredibly wild for I work in customer service in a professional</li>
            <li> He only had one of these and stated he was testing it out to see if he wants to carry it in his salon.</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S JUST A NATURAL HAIRSTYLE.  </li>
            <li> I initially opened the package and after seeing the stuff, didn&#x27;t think it would really hold my hair well.</li>
            <li> My hair did look matte and it made my hair look natural as if I wasn&#x27;t wearing any products.</li>
            <li> Works so well for straighter Asian hair compared to the products you would normally available in your local drugstore, supermarket, or big box store.</li>
            <li> This stuff leaves hair soft.</li>
            <li> In contrast, Grunge Mat is far, far stronger than this product (which Moving Rubber ranks as a 10/10).  </li>
            <li> natural does the hair feel throughout the day?  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s real life use, however, this product should only be for people with the shortest of hair (&lt;1 inch).  </li>
            <li> and it will stay that way for the rest of the day in a natural way.</li>
            <li> All I can say is wow.</li>
            <li> old girls.</li>
            <li> , it looks natural, no gelly smell,</li>
            <li> My hair sticks straight out when its short and somewhat flattens out as it grows out.</li>
            <li> Natural look</li>
            <li> and it is an all natural matte look.</li>
            <li> One application of this product will last you the whole day.  </li>
            <li> My second purchase of this product and highly recommend!</li>
            <li> think I had straight Japanese hair instead of the Filipino Brillo</li>
            <li> As far as i know.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a natural look.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used countless amounts of hair products (I have asian hair) and honestly thank god everyday for introducing me to this product.</li>
            <li> Styling wise for me was difficult.</li>
            <li> They like to roll around and play constantly and it was a chore trying to keep their edges laid down and stop them from becoming fuzzy.</li>
            <li> The spiky edge wax is very lightweight so it won&#x27;t weigh your hair down, yet allows you to mold you hair exactly how you want.</li>
            <li> Maybe if you used a lot of product it might be more difficult to remove, but I found it washes right out.</li>
            <li> Compared to other wax or similar products such as those of Axe, Mandom Gatsby gives you flexibility while maintaining hold much better.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a hair product that would not feel stiff or overly oily and this Moving Rubber product fit.  </li>
            <li> I have a pixie cut with short, short sides and long in front (5-6 inches), and shorter on the upper top (3-4 inches) of my hair</li>
            <li> Without any product in my hair, I just look flat out lame and a good 10 years older for some reason.</li>
            <li> I usually wear my hair short but as it grows longer I like a product that can handle the weight and length better.  </li>
            <li> This product is mainly for people with short to medium hair as the gatsby chart proclaims, which be seen here.</li>
            <li> The texture is fine, I just personally prefer something less goopy.</li>
            <li> This product has a thin, creamy texture that is very easy to spread into the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li> I barely have to use any Moving Rubber to get the desired result, with other products, it seems I have to use huge globs to get my hair to do the same thing.</li>
            <li> This is a great value, and i found myself using a whole lot less product than my other Gatsby products (preferably the pink and green jars), it just gets a little tough to wash out because of the extra texture, but all good it still washes out easy overall.</li>
            <li> I have been using Gatsby Moving Rubber since high school and have not turned back from it!  </li>
            <li> use a little and work into hair, then i will take a tiny bit more and lather in my hands to form the final look of my hair.</li>
            <li> With a little more than average shampoo than you normally use will do the trick.</li>
            <li> My hair is an inch or two long over my whole head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually order with free shipping</li>
            <li> My hair is not long so I only need as much as the tip of my finger.</li>
            <li> That said, I&#x27;ve found this to be true of every other hair product I&#x27;ve used (except those that rigidly lock hair in place, such as Got 2B</li>
            <li> (probably about 5 - 6 inches long on the top) and other products just weighed it down too much.  </li>
            <li> The downside to this product is that it makes your hair feel very dry after using it, and it kind of hard to wash out.</li>
            <li> I use Short Sexy&#x27;s Hard Up gel, nothing else</li>
            <li> For my short hair days and any other time I want a super hold I use this product.  </li>
            <li> This stuff doesn&#x27;t require as much product to achieve the same result, but much lighter feeling and locks in place extremely well.</li>
            <li> concern is that this product get dried too fast and very</li>
            <li> i use this everyday and pretend i am Goku going from super saiyan level 1 to 3</li>
            <li> The product is not a wax, nor &amp;#34;rubbery&amp;#34; - the texture is more like a really thick greek yogurt.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s major selling point.  </li>
            <li> Glad that the green apple smell does not last too long.</li>
            <li> Now, I use it as sort of a complement to the other gatsby product to tame the more stubborn parts.</li>
            <li> It gives a much more cleaner and natural look compared to the hard and wet look you get from gel.</li>
            <li> I love that you can still run your fingers through your hair to play with it, and add more product and it won&#x27;t make your head feel heavy or dirty.  </li>
            <li> The top is not that long either, usually between 1&amp;#34; and 2&amp;#34;, so I use this product for only the top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for some time now</li>
            <li> everytime you want to get it out to get your hair back to it&#x27;s natural softness.</li>
            <li> Any young Asian man should give this a try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried using Crew Pomades, both styling and grooming, but they&#x27;re just far too oily and do not offer enough strength.</li>
            <li> , being out in direct sunlight, you can actually feel it melt and collapse within minutes.</li>
            <li> Along with most everyone else is saying, it helps to thin out your hair.  </li>
            <li> I have had long hair my entire adult life and had no clue what types of product to use for the new style.  </li>
            <li> It will probably be used everyday for the next month too and still have enough for a few more days!</li>
            <li> I have fine short hair thats hard to style, but this stuff does the trick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried only a few different brands of hair gel/wax products and was fortunate to stumble onto this early in my search for a go-to product and have since stuck with this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap ($10 on Amazon as of my purchase, $13 at local stores) and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> , I think that this particular product is not meant for such long hair.</li>
            <li> It has a hint of apple smell, but like other said, not SO much that you smell fruity or like a girl</li>
            <li> This is a great gel if you&#x27;re looking for a little casual look but still have that hold.</li>
            <li> Its a lot more hold than American Crew, but I find the side effect is it makes my hair rock hard dry.</li>
            <li> For Asian individuals, it&#x27;s really hard to find a hair product that is strong enough to style our hair texture.</li>
            <li> It looks like white cream, but it goes on clear, leaving no white flakes or residuals</li>
            <li> (I have tried 4 different Gatsby waxes and the Pink seems to offer the strongest hold and is very versatile).  </li>
            <li> Works really well for styling thick asian hair, and I only need a fingertip&#x27;s worth so it should last awhile.</li>
            <li> &quot; ingredients does not dry my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> ; I expected something a bit more thick and waxy, like a clay.</li>
            <li> I can lay down on it without it crunching or getting goo or flakes on the furniture and when I sit back up, if it&#x27;s flat, I can simply mold it back into the original position.</li>
            <li> After reading all of the hype about the Gatsby Pink, I suppose my hopes were too high.  </li>
            <li> It is not stiff and lasts all day long.  </li>
            <li> Just purchased the green one recently and will probably use it right before a haircut as it is a lighter feeling</li>
            <li> The only missing star, that they should have this item for a better price because its a little over priced if you ask me.</li>
            <li> I bought it after being disappointed with two Axe Pomades that used to be great and now they can&#x27;t hold any hair of mine.</li>
            <li> I like the product so much I purchased 2 other Gatsby hair wax products for different looks and hair lengths.  </li>
            <li> Only con would be how hard it is to clean out of hair.</li>
            <li> and it gives my hair the proper support without having helmet hair due to too much hairspray.</li>
            <li> Pulled a few strands out applying it the first time.</li>
            <li> I prefer the grey one (for a more matte finish) but the pink one is usually cheaper.</li>
            <li> (at least that is true when it is used sparingly - I have not tried globs of it).</li>
            <li> While my hair IS starting to thin, I still have more than enough to style it.</li>
            <li> and I mean into the night, but I am a special case.</li>
            <li> I was curious about this product because reviews were highly rated for asian hair.</li>
            <li> Recommend this for anybody, but especially those with straight hair and want a different look other than the uniformed look gel gives you.</li>
            <li> I mean cool people and by pajamas</li>
            <li> at least quick to get rid of all the products.</li>
            <li> Immediately I fell in love with the product because not only get my hair up in a very small amount but it just looked fantastic and made my hair look casual.</li>
            <li> Seriously, that whole \\&quot;moving rubber\\&quot; thing is NOT just a clever name here.&lt;br /&gt;Some</li>
            <li> This stuff really, really holds the shape, and a little goes</li>
            <li> me, it was a little too much.</li>
            <li> Scent is a little much for me.  </li>
            <li> but if you have fine thin hair I wouldn&#x27;t expect the same results.  </li>
            <li> This thing has massive hold, a little too much for my tastes.  </li>
            <li> This product holds really well for Asian hair, but my scalp would feel a little bit itchy after I apply this.</li>
            <li> It doesnt flake like other putties, at least not as easily.</li>
            <li> this becomes a huge challenge as my hair grows out even 1 week after getting a hair cut, if you have hair like mine, you know how frustrating it is.  </li>
            <li> I have to use more to get it to hold firm, and when I do, my hair gets that thick,</li>
            <li> Most product I have tested have either been too hard or too sticky, and not easy to apply evenly.</li>
            <li> product.&lt;br /&gt;But, I&#x27;ll tell you right now that you&#x27;re going to have a hard time</li>
            <li> These are decent, but it looses its hold throughout the day and restyling will only last a few minutes before the hair falls back</li>
            <li> So wearing this product during even a slightly warm-ish day, eventually I always ended up feeling like someone had replaced my hair with a sweaty, candy-stinking, plastic sculpture of its normal</li>
            <li> I use a small bit of wax almost every day and this container lasted about an year (a bit less because I had used other products too like most people).</li>
            <li> A little bit rough when you first apply it.</li>
            <li> I am not sure why so many have said that it hard to remove from the hair, because I haven&#x27;t had one issue with this.  </li>
            <li> I have long, thick asian type hair and they stuff holds it right</li>
            <li> However, I usually see it for much lower prices in nearby Asian grocery stores, so if you have any of those nearby you can save some bucks.</li>
            <li> Got short hair and work/ be outside long for hours?</li>
            <li> First off, I have thick asian hair.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable hold (yet not stiff at all) for thick short hair, allowing for cool styles and textures  </li>
            <li> Hard to get out of hair, but can&#x27;t complain because it does exactly what I need it too.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and other gels either weigh the hair down too much in order to keep its shape or are too light and my hair just flops down by noon.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent product, just don&#x27;t use too much as a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> else my hairstyle just falls flat.  </li>
            <li> Since my hair is flat I always put the wax on my hair to volume it up, and hairspray.</li>
            <li> It works well with short hair and long air</li>
            <li> The wax last on my hair all day long.</li>
            <li> My hair is pretty thick</li>
            <li> When the package came in I was very sure that I wasted my money because I&#x27;m pakistani and I have short thick hair which makes it hard to styler.  </li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t be stiff, your hair will feel just as normal, just that it won&#x27;t be completely flat.</li>
            <li> and this has completely replaced my previous hair cream product, Goldwell Style Sign 4 Roughman Matte Cream Paste.  </li>
            <li> I left it over a month and it became extremely dry and absorb a lot of dust in the air.</li>
            <li> Just stop reading and buy this if you&#x27;ve got thick straight short asian/hispanic hair, and do yourself a favor and buy it now.  </li>
            <li> It gave me a matte dry that didn&#x27;t look like i was trying to hard, and that&#x27;s the first rule to being cool.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Grey has a bit less hold than purple but is completely matte.</li>
            <li> I also never used this or any other Japanese hair product while living in the country (in fact, I always used American hair products).  </li>
            <li> One time I accidentally left the lid open before going to work and by the time I arrive home, it gotten dry!!!</li>
            <li> Said that this crap starts drying as soon as you put it on your hands, you gotta be super quick</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to describe the texture as there isn&#x27;t really anything like it.  </li>
            <li> a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The pink one is definitely stronger..</li>
            <li> long to long&lt;br /&gt;Nuance</li>
            <li> long to long&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Grunge Matte / Grey ---</li>
            <li> and I would buy again even with the minor problems.</li>
            <li> When you wash your hair it does feel like it does not all come out, but that is only when it is wet.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;this is it, this is for keep, and for a long time to come people</li>
            <li> It holds my hair all day long</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this product in a long time.</li>
            <li> The only problem I have is that if I wet my hands to try and re-style it, it doesn&#x27;t work well.</li>
            <li> so it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> its pink, its the actual thing.</li>
            <li> This stuff seems a bit different than the harder wax products, but still works like a charm.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using bedhead wax for quite a long time.</li>
            <li> smell&lt;br /&gt;Lasts a long time&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> but it comes like a day or two earlier than expected arrival date (Maybe because of the area I&#x27;m in...).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also not near to any Japan Town</li>
            <li> long lasting&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> And if you want the wet look buy the blue.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 100% Chinese, and I&#x27;ve never really had a problem with this.</li>
            <li> Not for long term use.</li>
            <li> hold my style for long.</li>
            <li> but I have about 6inch long hair</li>
            <li> Sounds strange to say that about a hair product, but it does have a process to using it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got thick curly hair and this stuff has worked really well for spiking my hair.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, asian hair, but my hair is normally wavy</li>
            <li> I ran out of hair products on my business trip and ran down to the local corner store to pick up anything to hold me off until I got back to the States.  </li>
            <li> found that it works very well when the air is dry, but when it&#x27;s humid, or whenever I&#x27;m sweaty, it loses its hold and the hair is not reworkable.</li>
            <li> I am Asian and typically get a haircut that is a #1.5 or #2 on the sides and back.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way and the container has enough to last a long time.</li>
            <li> wet / Blue --- Wet / Medium long to long&lt;br /&gt;Comment Permalink</li>
            <li> /&gt;Please see my other reviews to compare against all of the above products.  </li>
            <li> The other thing I didn&#x27;t like is that it kinda left my hair kinda</li>
            <li> He loves it and one container lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li> Once your hair is dry it does not feel like it has any wax in it.  </li>
            <li> When rubbing it onto your hands it&#x27;s almsot dry by the time you run it into your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I often have to switch out to a non-Gatsby product for a day or two when my hair gets too dry.  </li>
            <li> This product is not \\&quot;natural\\&quot; in any way which I imagine contributes to the tendency to dry my hair as a pomade with \\&quot;natural\\</li>
            <li> product doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out in and of itself.  </li>
            <li> Rather, it acts as an accelerator with the sun&#x27;s rays to dry my hair (and bleach the color as well).</li>
            <li> So towel dry your hair and then do something else for a couple minutes.</li>
            <li> Can go in hair either dry or damp.</li>
            <li> , it will tend to dry out the product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just not sure I can justify the price/amount/performance ratio when compared to my old gel.</li>
            <li> pink, purple, and grey.  </li>
            <li> AC fiber is dry wax that you have to melt in your palms and fingers and when styling your hair it feels very dry and tacky.  </li>
            <li> br /&gt;Loose Shuffle/Orange --- Loose and disheveled / Medium</li>
            <li> It has super hold for people with very thick hair like myself and it does not leave the hair shiny!</li>
            <li> It only took a couple of hours before my hair started falling down.</li>
            <li> He said it helps hold down Asian men&#x27;s hair from sticking out from the side.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried at least a dozen different high-end products for my half-asian/half-hispanic head of thick, straight, brown hair, and I&#x27;ve finally found the mecca.  </li>
            <li> Smell - reminiscent of all of the previous reviewers; like an apple.  </li>
            <li> fi extreme hold styling cream, which provides an extreme hold with a low shine.</li>
            <li> Now, all I need is less than a dime size amount of this stuff to do the same job.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ll just stick to my previous hair wax American Crew Fiber.</li>
            <li> Every single time with minimal effort.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this just wasn&#x27;t thick enough to keep my hair in the same shape for as long as I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> My hair is straight and very hard to keep it in the direction</li>
            <li> It feels like there is a little bit of residue left after washing it away, but</li>
            <li> I only need to use a little bit</li>
            <li> One little container will last over 2 months if used conservatively.</li>
            <li> It must be a little damp, or you can&#x27;t distribute the product properly.</li>
            <li> All of these brands are not nearly as strong enough to give mold my air and still give it a dry look.</li>
            <li> too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A note about myself: my hair is grows straight out and is very thick.</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> it holds your style without the hard gel texture, makes your hair look like it naturally grows in the style you make it.</li>
            <li> The pink Gatsby is the Goldilocks of  all the Gatsby products.</li>
            <li> I then decided to try Redken Rough Clay which my gf had.  </li>
            <li> I apply the wax when my hairs is sort of wet</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think one is needed because even with the hair sort of wet, not dripping wet, you can style your hair and it drys just like you styled it.  </li>
            <li> If you need something stronger than this with minimal shine, I recommend d:</li>
            <li> Bought this for my boyfriend who has &#x27;asian&#x27; hair and was having trouble finding a product that would work but still remain pliable.</li>
            <li> Same firm hold but washes out no problem</li>
            <li> I wanted something that wouldn&#x27;t run when wet.</li>
            <li> I went to the beach and got wet.</li>
            <li> Used a few products from their line and not a big fan of this one.</li>
            <li> Partially.  </li>
            <li> I ordered the pink one and got the purple one.</li>
            <li> Came as expected from Gatsby.</li>
            <li> Pink is the strongest with matte.  </li>

            <li> A year ago, an empty box fell on my head and flattened my hairdo during work</li>
            <li> ; effect of Gatsby pink is probably</li>
            <li> You need to wet your hair or wet your hand when putting the wax on your hair.  </li>

            <li> like I stated, I have really coarse, thick Asian hair.</li>
            <li> I have coarse, thick asian hair</li>
            <li> I have bushy, thick , coarse asian hair.</li>
            <li> The one con isn&#x27;t too bad beacuse it has to be fairly hot (I live in cali) for that to happen.</li>
            <li> Very bad, which is surprising given that Moving Rubber marks this at a 9/10 hold.  </li>
            <li> It should be noted that I am Asian and my dark black hair works well with it.  </li>
            <li> Am a white guy with thickish, dark blond, slightly wavy hair who likes a bit of style in his locks and who lived and worked in Japan for 15 years and</li>
            <li> Not strong enough for my hair</li>
            <li> /&gt;After using this product you might notice this product is very hard to wash off and sometimes you might even notice hair starts falling off this is probably one of the worse things about gatsby pink because its so good hold its very hard to was off</li>
            <li> The problem with that is, it would go flat after a few hours.</li>
            <li> I have thick (naturally) blonde hair almost 4 inches long.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for people with stiff, unforgiving, thick hair.</li>
            <li> Molds your hair without looking like product in your hair, a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Oh and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> : A little product goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way with this rubber wax</li>
            <li> It holds all day long with just a little help with hairspray.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way-</li>
            <li> /&gt; - a little does go a long way&lt;br</li>
            <li> And he only had to use very little of it to style my hair, that is an added bonus. &#x3D;</li>
            <li> and I wash my hair at least 1 per day and generally 2 per day.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, I bought this and 2 other ones..</li>
            <li> but you only need to use a small amount each time.    </li>
            <li> I did want to mention that just like any other hair product you can wash it off in the shower but</li>
            <li> tried other products like axe wax.</li>
            <li> I have used other Gatsby hair wax and like it.  </li>
            <li> then other hair products I have used.</li>
            <li> but other than that i recommend this product to everyone</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever use any another styling product than this and other gatsby products.</li>
            <li> I use it to style my fohawk and it stays up all day with only a small amount of product (about the size of a quarter).</li>
            <li> I also bought some of the other Gasby&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Creamy compared to the other products.</li>
            <li> This stuff makes your hair stiffer than the other waxes.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product and will try the one in the green container also!</li>
            <li> d-fi extreme  </li>
            <li> Unlike other products, my hair won&#x27;t look greasy, it will hold my hair</li>
            <li> i used other products and for my type of hair</li>
            <li> You can literally pull the hair apart and stick it to other hair allowing you to move and sculpt the style of your hair - at will.&lt;br /&gt;That</li>
            <li> Would look forward to other product that does not have this problem.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it can dry out and clump in the container, which can result in white chunks in your hair if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li> When you try to fix your hair just a little bit after putting it on, it will be painful to do it, which is what I love about this</li>
            <li> A little hard to remove from hair at first, took me two shampoos, so a small pea sized amount works for me, an amount taking half of your index finger might work for you.</li>
            <li> I only use a fingertip of the stuff, even a little bit less, rub on my hands and spread over my hair and mess it around.</li>
            <li> It has a slightly sticky feels on wet hair.  </li>
            <li> However, if you&#x27;re the active type, like me, and have towel around the neck to wipe off the stinging sweat, this product isn&#x27;t for us.</li>
            <li> It is flexible and can provide solid structure if you do not have heavy limp hair or longer than 2.5 inches.</li>
            <li> any which way I choose, rearrange my hair multiple times a day, and all of this without making my hair look greasy, which is a problem for me with my slick black</li>
            <li> My hair did feel different compared to other gels and wax, as this did not leave a hard, crusty feel to it.</li>
            <li> I find it helps to wet my fingertips with a little bit of water before spreading the product on my hands as it makes it easier to work with.</li>
            <li> If you put it on wet hair it will leave it a little crunchy.  </li>
            <li> Additionally, this wax product is less greasier than other products that gatsby offer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The hold last all day and the hair does not feel like rock hard spikes even though you can shape it spiky.  </li>
            <li> the only reason i gave this product 4 out of 5 stars because it is hard to wash this stuff out of your hair.</li>
            <li> I have very stiff east Asian hair that I keep no longer than an inch and a half or so, and have struggled to find a hair product that would do anything to my hair that it did not already feel like doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Average average average.</li>
            <li> It last at least 2 months for me</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll definitely be using this brand going forward, at least, while I still have some hair on my head.</li>
            <li> Other products I&#x27;ve used include Sumotech from Bumble and Bumble, Alterna Hemp modeling clay, Alterna hair cement, Sebastian Crude Clay (original), and others.</li>
            <li> I have used the pink, purple and green.  </li>
            <li> I have thick Asian hair.</li>
            <li> Just be careful as it could leave dandruff-like residue if applied too heavily.</li>
            <li> My thick hair stays where it should, and can be re-styled even hours after the initial application.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a caucasian male with thick, semi-coarse hair.</li>
            <li> It smells like sour apple and rubber.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t clump, surprisingly enough with how thick it is.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, asian hair.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve been using the wax for 3 months on thick un-straightened hair only to realize the wax didn&#x27;t work the way i thought since my hair was uncontrollable.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT KEEPS THE SIDES OF MY HEAD DOWN.</li>
            <li> Down.</li>
            <li> I researched and have used tons of other stuff and nothing has lived up to the hype until now!  </li>
            <li> Also, washing your hair can be a little frustrating because it&#x27;s hard to take off at first.</li>
            <li> Also, washing your hair can be a little frustrating because it&#x27;s hard to take off at first.</li>
            <li> Because this product is not very strong, you will need a lot of product to achieve a hold.  </li>
            <li> and they shipped it to India in less than 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> previously I&#x27;ve been using \\&quot;La</li>
            <li> It holds hair about half a day.</li>
            <li> There is a slightly shine</li>
            <li> where i want it while allowing it to be slightly molded.</li>
            <li> It feels slightly rubbery, which should be no surprise given the name.</li>
            <li> /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;-&amp;#34;melts&amp;#34; or softens and turns slightly greasy in the sun or heat</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve paid $18 to $23 and this is like half that, no way it works as well.</li>
            <li> ( about less than 2 inches).</li>
            <li> After a minute or two of a slight strawberry smell, it&#x27;s odorless.  </li>
            <li> I usually love Gatsby products and have had this one before, but the one I ordered recently was awful.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t manage to tame my short hairs on the back of my head.  </li>
            <li> Exactly the worst for modern, Princeton-ish haircuts.  </li>
            <li> Only small complaint is the smell.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t matter how much or little</li>
            <li> /&gt;Putting a little bit on and spreading it on your palms</li>
            <li> Little amount goes a looooong way  </li>
            <li> If your hair is 1-3&amp;#34; this will work well either using a lot to get a spiky look or just a little to feather it to the side.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t leave your hair hard and crusty or wet.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that this stuff is hard to wash off, hence the 4 star rating.</li>
            <li> Glued (#4? comes in yellow container) and that was worse, I thought.    </li>
            <li> After a few hours, my son does need to refresh the look by using his fingers.</li>
            <li> The stuff worked well but took a few showers to fully wash out.  </li>
            <li> It smells like green apple for a bit until it drys up, but I like this</li>
            <li> Smells of green apples, but the fragrance fades rather quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wont be using this stuff again as it is obviously to harsh on my hair if i need to wash 4-5 times to get it all out.</li>
            <li> usually do a messy spike.</li>
            <li> The product itself is a staple to me everyday.</li>
            <li> I cut my hair into a pixie style a few months ago.  </li>
            <li> I used to use another product that is not available any longer.</li>
            <li> stickier than the green one.</li>
            <li> I was going for the d trix hair with this and with the green gatsby and spikes after with this product</li>
            <li> use it everyday and can not go without it.  </li>
            <li> and ive been using Gatsby moving rubber spiky edge every day for a few years now</li>
            <li> It works like it should... keeps the hair firm as advertised.</li>
            <li> : Smells like green apple.</li>
            <li> I was a bit surprised since it was really expensive stuff</li>
            <li> but after a few hours It  becomes flaky looking in your hair.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t over-apply or it will feel heavy and oily.</li>
            <li> Not a huge difference.</li>
            <li> I use the Spiky Edge to keep my hair designed for casual and professional settings.  </li>
            <li> so it will make your hair feel a little stiff but</li>
            <li> Stays pliable throughout the day - my previous very thick gel would work for the first couple hours of the day, but then be useless for the rest.</li>
            <li> The one negative is that if the hair does fall on your skin, it leaves a slight residue that could lead to clogged pores down the line.</li>
            <li> I usually take half and put water in it so that its not so sticky.  </li>
            <li> He says that it isn&#x27;t as sticky or dries as hard as other hair wax.</li>
            <li> Other than that it holds up all day and doesn&#x27;t give your hair that hard crusty feeling.</li>
            <li> I would rebut that gross understatement by saying that it reeks of that artificial sour-apple scent that is usually reserve for stuff like jolly rancher candies and possibly children&#x27;s bath products.</li>
            <li> People think my hair would be stiff but are amazed when they touch it.</li>
            <li> Since my hair is so stiff</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make your hair stiff or crunchy like gel.  </li>
            <li> It holds the style without looking too stiff and also isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday for my hair and it usually does well.</li>
            <li> you find this product difficult to wash out simply work in a little baking soda after lathering with shampoo</li>
            <li> It also gave my hair a dusty dry look, but fade after an hour or two.</li>
            <li> A little dab will do you!</li>
            <li> I live in the midwest (US) and we have wet springs, cold winters and humid summers, so I will add an update to see how this product holds up to those tough conditions.  </li>
            <li> It seems like you get very little amount for your money</li>
            <li> It feels a bit greasy but has VERY little shine.</li>
            <li> I used very little of this stuff.</li>
            <li> I have really thick hair and just a little dab of this stuff keeps my hair under control.</li>
            <li> Takes very little and doesn&#x27;t flake or turn to grease.  </li>
            <li> A small amount i sufficient.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually don&#x27;t write reviews for products but felt like sharing my experience for Mandom Gatsby</li>
            <li> I usually stick to a product once I find something I like that works.  </li>
            <li> Over the past year, I have been in search of the \\&quot;perfect\\&quot; hair creme/wax which provides the highest hold and a matte look.  </li>
            <li> Note that Spiky Edge is usually for shorter hair.  </li>
            <li> But the price and the seemingly small amount made me hesitant.</li>
            <li> If you usually style your hair in a spiky fashion or a faux hawk</li>
            <li> Apply a small pea-size to your palm with Spiky Edge.</li>
            <li> and I usually prefer pomades, gels, waxes and stying glues with words like \\&quot;extreme\\&quot;, \\&quot;super\\&quot;, or \\&quot;insane\\&quot; contained somewhere in the description of the product&#x27;s intended effect.</li>
            <li> To alleviate, try adding a small amount of water and replacing lid.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, this paid off in a big way when I got home, wink</li>
            <li> The product is usually like a semi-liquid, but this one is hardened and is like clay.  </li>
            <li> I have very thin blonde hair and</li>
            <li> I did not honestly expect it to be so small...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too bad, because I don&#x27;t need to buy it so often, and when I do buy it, it&#x27;s usually not an emergency.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a product that doesn&#x27;t leave your hair clumpy, shiny, hard, or stinky from all the product...</li>
            <li> Not that hard for styling</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make your hair rock hard, and it gives you a lot of flexibility with your hair.</li>
            <li> The wax sets in hard though</li>
            <li> , this stuff is hard to wash off.</li>
            <li> Over all you should use spiky edge if you have hard to control hair and just need something that works.</li>
            <li> Too hard to wash off.</li>
            <li> It was hard to find one that would hold his hair all day</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t make it hard or greasy to the touch.</li>
            <li> In addition, its not shiny nor rock hard once its set.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s so hard to wash out</li>
            <li> /&gt;80g is not much; I guess it is a bit expensive</li>
            <li> Will form white flake makes your hair look dirty.  </li>
            <li> complaint I do have is that it is now an add-on item.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my son, he complained that his hair was too &amp;#34;coarse&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;rough&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> But the hair is too wet, my hair becomes floppy and difficult to style.</li>
            <li> At least to me.  </li>
            <li> I never liked the shiny gel or the hairspray.  </li>
            <li> My one complaint is that it takes about three washings to remove the pomade from your hair.</li>
            <li> ARE YOU ASIAN WITH CRAZY POOFY BRISTLY HAIR?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> One dime size is all I need to style my thick mop of hair and keep it in place all day.</li>
            <li> This stuff works wonders on my thick hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is 1-2 inches, extremely thick</li>
            <li> For one it was SO thick</li>
            <li> and thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have wavy-curly, thick hair.  </li>
            <li> I mean jam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- fairly expensive compared to other hair wax products&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually like using wax over gel and this product got the job done!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got quite thick hair that is very hard to manage, to the extent that I had to use hard wax in order to get a style to hold.</li>
            <li> I then came across Mandom which I was skeptical about since it was thin liquid cream compared to the other products I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> A little difficult to wash out</li>
            <li> /&gt;Though before buying this you must know that this hair will not work well with very thick hair if you apply this to thick hair</li>
            <li> It gets fluffy and weird if you move it after it dries.</li>
            <li> I randomly picked a few.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not going for a faux hawk, combover, or any other crazy hairstyle</li>
            <li> It hold well but is VERY hard to wash out.    </li>
            <li> /&gt; - smell, an artificial strawberry starburst type smell that dissipates after a half hour or so</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really tough to wash out though.   </li>
            <li> It is a bit tough to get out during a washing</li>
            <li> My hair is very thick</li>
            <li> I have thin hair and wax</li>
            <li> Have thin hair.</li>
            <li> IT NOW, it will change the game.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used gel&#x27;s in the past, but hate how they seem to goop up my hair and also make it hard as a rock, at least the brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Trust me, your dead wrong!</li>
            <li> but I believe you aren&#x27;t suppose to condition every day there is a plus though because it doesn&#x27;t feel bad to sleep in for those late nights when you&#x27;re too lazy to wash it out.</li>
            <li> The wax has a slight smell to it, but nothing bad.</li>
            <li> A little annoying to wash off though.</li>
            <li> The Bad: Hard to wash out.</li>
            <li> but I was WRONG.  </li>
            <li> It is also expensive for the amount they give you.</li>
            <li> Am I doing something wrong?</li>
            <li> 9mdf sad , cd cw q</li>
            <li> You can never go wrong with Gatsby hair care products.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with both.</li>
            <li> I hated that gel wet look</li>
            <li> Has a weird apple smell</li>
            <li> The hold and body is unstoppable but doesn&#x27;t feel weird to the touch.</li>
            <li> this product is definitely difficult to wash out compared to gel.</li>
            <li> yeah, needless to say</li>
            <li> a bit expensive but this stuff sticks and molds your hair</li>
            <li> VERY TOUGH wax.</li>
            <li> where I wanted it (needed some readjustment throughout the day because it has a pliable hold) and also didn&#x27;t have a grotesque texture or do horrible things to my hair i.e: drying out, or being impossible to wash out or creating white flakes.  </li>
            <li> makes your hair look a bit dirty.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have pockets of crazy poufy</li>
            <li> I DON&#x27;T HAVE A CRAZY KOREAN HAIRSTYLE</li>
            <li> nothing to be afraid of.</li>
            <li> I tried all of the horrible thick gel they sell here in the US and it&lt;</li>
            <li> It is very difficult to deal with and and shape/manipulate and give volume.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nothing bad to say about this brand.</li>
            <li> and I get frustrated when a hair product doesn&#x27;t hold up my hair like I want it to.</li>
            <li> I tried it on my 6&amp;8 yr olds :(</li>
            <li> But this time I opened it and was disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I hate using hairspray because of the smell and the way it feels the day after.  </li>
            <li> I hate when hair product makes my head shiny.</li>
            <li> Smells a bit fruity and like hair product, but it isn&#x27;t too bad!</li>
            <li> Quite disappointed in this product!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s awful!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Product is great! Reached on time</li>
            <li> I got this for my boyfriend and he really likes it. I wish it was bigger because he goes through these pretty quickly. He says that it isn&#x27;t as sticky or dries as hard as other hair wax.</li>
            <li> A year ago, I got sort of a pomp-undercut (my hair is about four inches on top). I&#x27;ve tried about a half-dozen products before this one, and this stuff is easily the best. This stuff really, really holds the shape, and a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent isn&#x27;t great (it smells like rubber--like the name) but it&#x27;s very mild and light, so you won&#x27;t notice it except when you smell the container itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: affordable, super strong but pliable hold, don&#x27;t need a lot for effective hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: scent.</li>
            <li> I much prefer this over Bed Head for Men &amp;#34;Matte Separation Workable Wax&amp;#34; This is a great product.  I took a chance, having no idea what I would get, and it paid off. It has the same hold as Bed Head, but it is MUCH softer, and it also lasts all day. I also prefer this over American Crew Fiber, which was the first product I started off with before moving on to Bed Head and now this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s my preference ranking of men&#x27;s hair product from best to worst:&lt;br /&gt;1) This (Gatsby Moving Rubber)&lt;br /&gt;2) Bed Head Matte Separation Workable Wax&lt;br /&gt;3) American Crew &amp;#34;Classic Fiber&amp;#34; (the blue one)</li>
            <li> Best hair wax on the market I believe</li>
            <li> Styling with this takes like 30 seconds!  Easy to use and doesn&#x27;t make your hair feel gross or gunky.</li>
            <li> I am immensely thankful for Amazon Global shipping. I first bought this product when I was in Hong Kong a year ago. Now that it was getting over I wondered how to refill it back on my shelf and voila thr was a seller I found on Amazon USA and they shipped it to India in less than 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;I love the product...its a real deal and makes my short hair stand out 😆😍😎</li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s different for most ppl. Hold wise this wax is great. Styling wise for me was difficult. Maybe bc I have thin hair and wax doesn&#x27;t work that well with thin hair, but if you&#x27;re looking for a wax product that&#x27;s cheap and holds well I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
            <li> been using this for years&lt;br /&gt;smells good&lt;br /&gt;strong&lt;br /&gt;and price isn&#x27;t too shabby although it used to be much cheaper lol</li>
            <li> Molds your hair without looking like product in your hair, a little bit goes a long way. This is great.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a hair product that would not feel stiff or overly oily and this Moving Rubber product fit.  It seemed like it wouldn&#x27;t hold well when I put it on my fingers but once it is on your hair, it works great and holds all day.  The product also smells very pleasant, almost apple-like.  It does leave your hair feeling sticky but overall it is a very good product.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  I have used the pink, purple and green.  The pink one is my favorite.</li>
            <li> I have used everything from clay, pomades, and waxes, but nothing comes close to this great product. I have fine short hair thats hard to style, but this stuff does the trick. I love how I can always add more product to touch up my hair throughout the day. I also love the matte look. My only complaint is that this stuff is hard to wash off, hence the 4 star rating.</li>
            <li> Some background: .. previously I&#x27;ve been using \\&quot;La Bella\\&quot; (found @ walmart) and it&#x27;s been the best gel I found so far.. I &#x27;ve tried Got2B Glued (#4? comes in yellow container) and that was worse, I thought.    Anyway, I bought this and 2 other ones.. all says they are 80g but are in different colors:  pink, purple, and grey.  SO far I&#x27;ve tried the pink one and the purple one.  The pink one is definitely stronger.. so if your hair is like mine where it seems to want to do its own thing, then grab this color and take a pass on the purple one..  Likewise, if your hair is easily tamed then go for the weaker of the two (the purple).    Very happy with Gatsby product.    PS: I haven&#x27;t tried the grey one, yet, but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s just as awesome as the rest.</li>
            <li> The title says it all! For my African American females or males, looking for defined looks including twist - outs/ braid - outs GET this product. Miracle in a bottle! Dries fast, residue fades away, is a bit sticky. It was \\&quot;bad\\&quot; ingredients, (look for another site for this information.) Although it has wack ingredients, it packs a perfect style punch! Get wit it, and try this..</li>
            <li> Hey, y&#x27;all. I have thick Asian hair. I used to use Crew Fiber, which worked awesome. Problems with the Crew Fiber (1) it&#x27;s a bit pricey, (2) it has a whole bunch of parabens, which is my main reason for moving away from Crew products. In my attempt to use more natural, non-cancer-causing products, I found the whole line of Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soaps, and this Mandom Gatsby Moving Rubber. Here&#x27;s the deal: like I stated, I have really coarse, thick Asian hair. Using a quarter-sized dollop of this stuff in my hair after showering and towel drying my hair keeps my hair in check and allows me to spike, gently tousle, or give my hair some texture. Without any product in my hair, I have Brillo Pad hair - it&#x27;s really poofy. This Mandom Moving Rubber does the job, is economically priced, and is made without parabens. Oh, and it smells good - like apples or something. It gets my seal of approval.</li>
            <li> Along with most everyone else is saying, it helps to thin out your hair.  My hair is very thick and I like to keep it very short, so I need the strongest hold possible.  I use Short Sexy&#x27;s Hard Up gel, nothing else has proven to have as strong of a hold.  I gave the remaining portions of this wax to my friend and he said it works perfect.</li>
            <li> After reading all of the hype about the Gatsby Pink, I suppose my hopes were too high.  I&#x27;m concerned though that I may have received a knock off version.  Packaging - exactly the same as shown.  Smell - reminiscent of all of the previous reviewers; like an apple.  Hold - Not so much.  At the moment my hair doesn&#x27;t even look like I used product this morning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this since I lived in Japan from 2006-2009.  It is without a doubt, the best hair product for short or even medium length spiky hair.  It doesn&#x27;t harden after putting it on, so your hair stays pliable throughout the day.  There isn&#x27;t a strong odor to it, and it washes out very easily.  I really enjoy the fact that you don&#x27;t need to use very much product to get your hair to do what you want. So an 80g container of this will usually last me up to three months.  If you&#x27;re looking for a product that doesn&#x27;t leave your hair clumpy, shiny, hard, or stinky from all the product... this is most definitely worth a try.  No joke, it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve ever used (and I&#x27;m in my 30&#x27;s, so I&#x27;ve tried a lot of hair giz).</li>
            <li> Very good stuff, holds extremely well even with curly hair. Shipped in on time with no complaints</li>
            <li> I am Asian and typically get a haircut that is a #1.5 or #2 on the sides and back. The top is not that long either, usually between 1&amp;#34; and 2&amp;#34;, so I use this product for only the top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for some time now and this has completely replaced my previous hair cream product, Goldwell Style Sign 4 Roughman Matte Cream Paste.  Both products worked great for my hair, but I found that the Gatsby lasted a bit longer even though it is a smaller size, 2.8oz vs 3.3oz for the Goldwell.  The price is much steeper for the Goldwell as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are Asian with short hair, you won&#x27;t be disapointed.  Plus, it smells great!</li>
            <li> Probably my fourth or fifth bottle. It lasts a long time and a little goes a long way. It doesnt flake like other putties, at least not as easily. I have to wear a hat sometimes for work and when i take it off, the putty doesnt flake. You have to try to make it flake. Recommend it fa sho.</li>
            <li> This is the king of all waxes...  Don&#x27;t know why more people in the US don&#x27;t know about it.</li>
            <li> This has better hold and control than any other product in the US.  My husband will not use anything else!  This is also a very popular product in Japan.</li>
            <li> Tried it the first time in Tokyo, and I&#x27;ve loved it since then.&lt;br /&gt;People often will also compliment me on its nice smell.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best product I have used for my short spiky hair. Does not leave my hair or scalp feeling gross, washes out with regular shampoo. I can lay down on it without it crunching or getting goo or flakes on the furniture and when I sit back up, if it&#x27;s flat, I can simply mold it back into the original position.</li>
            <li> works perfect for my hair!</li>
            <li> Works great for my thick spikey Asian hair! Will be buying more.</li>
            <li> Got short hair and work/ be outside long for hours? It&#x27;s the perfect product for your hair. Work better on Asian hair and I&#x27;m not being racist, it just works better. Still, give it a shot if you have short hair, it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> good smell and ok to use it</li>
            <li> Best product for my hair!</li>
            <li> Fantastic product for Messy Hairstyles, Up Spiky and just generally fun moving styles. It&#x27;s sticky but it holds well although you might still need some hairspray if you want to keep your hair spiked Up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells really nice and it&#x27;s easy to wash off both from your hands and your hair.</li>
            <li> A great product for all the spiky haired guys out there.  Ordered this as gift for my brother and he keeps asking for more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years.  This is available at the local Japanese supermarket, but it&#x27;s more convenient for me to have it delivered to my house by Amazon, and it&#x27;s slightly cheaper to boot.  This is a great balance between holding power and stiffness.  It doesn&#x27;t make your hair rigid, but has enough to control the shape, true to its &amp;#34;moving rubber&amp;#34; name.  The only problem is washing it off, it requires a lot of shampoo.</li>
            <li> I love the Gatsby line of hair products. I think they do what they say they will do, do it well, are easy to work with, don&#x27;t leave flakes and wash out relatively easily. They also smell good. This product is great if you need super hold. I prefer the Gatsby Wild Shake to this for my hair, but that&#x27;s because I am not looking for the super hold that this product provides. If you have anime hair or a major hawk or liberty spike situation, this would be a good product. I think Wild Shake is better if you need a bit more pliable action or not quite so much hold. The Great Gatsby.</li>
            <li> product holds well but easily catches lint and other white stuff in your hair.  makes your hair look a bit dirty.</li>
            <li> works good but wont last for all day</li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim, because I wanted to replace the teenager style Axe hair product I have been using for a decade. This one works great and smells great too. This is basically the functional equivalent to the &amp;#34;spiked&amp;#34; Axe product, the red label. Superior to Axe products (not hard to believe) and the price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> The pink Gatsby is the Goldilocks of  all the Gatsby products. It is neither too heavy nor too light, which is just perfect for my short-medium length hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try the internet for hundreds of tutorials on how to use the product, not only you will find useful tips, but also a chuckle and some laughs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I like their products is that they doesn&#x27;t feel stiff like glue or sticky as pomades, yet able to shape your hair looking natural; it is no wonder it is called \\&quot;moving rubber\\&quot;. My hair is not long so I only need as much as the tip of my finger. What also great is that you can reshape your hair anytime of the day by just a little water, moist your palms and rub it on your hair, a few brush strokes and your set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;80g is not much; I guess it is a bit expensive considering it is imported from Japan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product / Color --- Style / Hair length&lt;br /&gt;-----------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;Spiky Edge/Red(looks more Pink) --- Spiky and stirring / Very short to short hair&lt;br /&gt;Wild shake/Purple --- Wild and spiky / short to medium short&lt;br /&gt;Air rise/Green --- Soft and volume/ Medium to medium long&lt;br /&gt;Loose Shuffle/Orange --- Loose and disheveled / Medium long to long&lt;br /&gt;Nuance Motion/Yellow --- Natural &amp; nuance / Medium long to long&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grunge Matte / Grey --- Matte / Short to medium short&lt;br /&gt;Cool wet / Blue --- Wet / Medium long to long&lt;br /&gt;Comment Permalink</li>
            <li> Great product, light not &#x27;tacky&#x27; so it is not stuck on your fingers.  Works really well, the real test is the next day when you wake up and this product passed the test with flying colors.  Still spiky yet flexible.  No weird next day product feel to your hair, no need to wash your hair twice to get it out.  Smells great too.light scent of Granny Smith apples.</li>
            <li> This is the best hair product I&#x27;ve ever used.  It holds very well and shapes my hair really well.  I love the fact that I can mess with my hair and reshape it well after initially putting it in my hair.  It seems like you get very little amount for your money but you only need to use a small amount each time.    It should be noted that I am Asian and my dark black hair works well with it.  I would say if you have strong sturdy hair this product would really work well for you but if you have fine thin hair I wouldn&#x27;t expect the same results.  I did want to mention that just like any other hair product you can wash it off in the shower but it should be noted that you need to thoroughly wash it out as it seems to cling to your hair a bit better than gel.</li>
            <li> The hair wax works really well. It molds and holds. After a few hours, my son does need to refresh the look by using his fingers. The one negative is that if the hair does fall on your skin, it leaves a slight residue that could lead to clogged pores down the line.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for many times. Very good product. And good service.</li>
            <li> Honestly I was wondering whether or not to buy this item. The PINK Rubber Spiky Edge Hair Wax is definitely nice. It does hold well but the one that I was looking for was the purple case wax. That has a much stronger hold than that of the pink kind. I am Korean with moderately short hair (2&amp;#34; at its longest point). Hope this helped. If you are looking to get a wax that can be applied easily and with moderate proportions than I would highly recommend this wax. One of the best things about getting this wax is that it doesn&#x27;t make your hair appear oily or have any sheen.</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have ever used; especially as my hair grows out.  Controlled chaos is the best way to describe what it does for my hair.  It is not stiff and lasts all day long.  I have received lots of compliments since using this product.</li>
            <li> Will form white flake makes your hair look dirty.  It holds hair about half a day. I was expecting it to be better since it has many great reviews.</li>
            <li> Really good product, helps give me a messy look very easily. I only use a fingertip of the stuff, even a little bit less, rub on my hands and spread over my hair and mess it around. It keeps my hair looking natural as well and its still touchable. Doesn&#x27;t only work on Asian hair, it also works on my Dominican wavy hair. It also comes in a cool little case and smells nice.</li>
            <li> Came packaged great, same as most companies. Wrapped in newspaper and in a box, no damage. Works out great, Spyky Edge is for upper medium strength tug on hair. Fits me well</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really do anything for my hair. I have wavy hair and I couldn&#x27;t really style it a lot with this wax.</li>
            <li> Great for keeping hair where it should be.  A small amount i sufficient.</li>
            <li> Its a lot more hold than American Crew, but I find the side effect is it makes my hair rock hard dry. To the point where you could shower and scrub your hair and still feel that its got a bit of this wax afterwards. But, for hold, texture, non greasy/shiny, and doesn&#x27;t wear off at the end of the day, this is great, especially for my asian hair.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite styling products out there. Great hold without making your hair hard. People think my hair would be stiff but are amazed when they touch it. This choice is great for short to medium length hair. Oh and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Compared to other wax or similar products such as those of Axe, Mandom Gatsby gives you flexibility while maintaining hold much better. Also, it dries quickly which helps to create volume. I will definitely buy this product again.</li>
            <li> The Best Product I Have Ever Used..</li>
            <li> I use this + the blue one to keep a good sheen and hold for my hair. It lasts all day! :]</li>
            <li> Over all great product, just took a while for the shipping. Using the spyky edge takes time and you gotta play with your hair to get the look you want.</li>
            <li> Good, reliable product which will hold your hair all day long !&lt;br /&gt;I will buy it again when I finish this one :)</li>
            <li> Best hair wax ever and I&#x27;ve tried so many products before!</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair nice and in place</li>
            <li> holds strong. tried other products like axe wax. this one trumps</li>
            <li> This thing has massive hold, a little too much for my tastes.  It smells nice.</li>
            <li> A little bit sticky but does a great job on my faux hawk hair style. Moreover, I like the smell</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually don&#x27;t write reviews for products but felt like sharing my experience for Mandom Gatsby Moving Spyky Edge.  I usually stick to a product once I find something I like that works.  For years I used Alterna Hair Concrete which did a really good job of holding my short Chinese hair, lol.  The stuff worked well but took a few showers to fully wash out.  I then decided to try Redken Rough Clay which my gf had.  It worked pretty well but left my hair frizzy but held really well.  I wanted to buy more when it ran out but found out Redken stopped making it.  I then came across Mandom which I was skeptical about since it was thin liquid cream compared to the other products I&#x27;ve used.  Since my hair is so stiff I need my hair product to set fast or else my hairstyle just falls flat.  So I used some Mandom this morning and didn&#x27;t think it would work well but I was WRONG.  It drys pretty quickly and holds amazingly well.  It doesn&#x27;t make your hair stiff or crunchy like gel.  After a full day of work its still holding. I can still style it and have it hold.  The best stuff I&#x27;ve used by far and you can&#x27;t beat the price.  I used to pay $20 - $30 for hair products but for that amount I get double/triple the amount of Mandom!  If you&#x27;re on the fence about trying definitely give it a try.</li>
            <li> I love this! I know its meant for men but the first time I heard about this was back in 2010 and I wasn&#x27;t aware of the line for women. Now, Gatsby has a female line which I might try once my current container runs out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought my first container (Spiky Edge) back in 2010 and still use Gatsby products to day. My &#x27;Spiky edge&#x27; wax gets stolen by my boyfriend whenever he gets his hair cut short, hehe: I never thought I would share my hair products with my man. In this case it&#x27;s cool, since it IS meant for men after all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the &#x27;Spiky Edge&#x27; when I had short hair and then switched to &#x27;Air Rise&#x27; the longer my hair became. Just be careful as it could leave dandruff-like residue if applied too heavily. As you can see on most of the videos or tutorials: ALL YOU NEED IS A SMALL AMOUNT and you&#x27;ll be good to go :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gatsby products are all-around good for styling without the mess and the \\&quot;greasy\\&quot; look.</li>
            <li> I have been using tigi wax stick, crew wax and various forms of powders (Sexy Hair Big Sexy Hair Powder Play, Osis + Dust It Matifying Powder and Kevin Murphy Powder Puff).  This goes on like a wax and turns into the powder type hold I&#x27;m used to.  I appreciate it because i have so much control in the application and disbursement and then when it dries (very quickly) I have fab hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t look like a grease-ball now and I don&#x27;t have pockets of crazy poufy hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Gatsby, my love, my life, my savior.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything you can get at the store and found this stuff online.  It has the name moving rubber for a reason.  It acts it&#x27;s name and is highly malleable.  It smells like green apple for a bit until it drys up, but I like this, it&#x27;s a nice fresh scent.</li>
            <li> Works incredibly well. A little bit goes a long way and the container has enough to last a long time.</li>
            <li> I did not honestly expect it to be so small... one star.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the cat&#x27;s pajamas and by cat I mean cool people and by pajamas I mean jam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro: Really good stiff hold yet flexible. Can wear wet if you like that look.&lt;br /&gt;Con: kind of bulky to put into travel bag.</li>
            <li> Smells a bit fruity and like hair product, but it isn&#x27;t too bad! This holds insanely strong and if I apply a bit too much, my hair begins to hold and clump like glue! I would definitely use this conservatively and work with the hair rather than the product. I am going to buy this again. I use a small bit of wax almost every day and this container lasted about an year (a bit less because I had used other products too like most people). Highly recommend for people with stiff, unforgiving, thick hair. There is a slightly shine but I would still consider it matte. It is pretty easy to tell when this product is used however.</li>
            <li> Stuff works great!  Keeps hair pliable.</li>
            <li> Not that hard for styling</li>
            <li> One of the best styling products that I&#x27;ve found.  It doesn&#x27;t make your hair rock hard, and it gives you a lot of flexibility with your hair.</li>
            <li> First and foremost I Don&#x27;t give out five stars easily, If I could I&#x27;d give this product a 4.5 out of 5.   The Good: A little product goes a long way. Smells good. My thick hair stays where it should, and can be re-styled even hours after the initial application. Malleable/Pliable is a good way to explain it.   The Bad: Hard to wash out.</li>
            <li> Always have been using this one. Average average average.</li>
            <li> I have used other Gatsby hair wax and like it.  This is actually my favorite.  It is very light yet where it does not bring the hair down yet holds hair strong.  Will purchase again</li>
            <li> Product works great and probably the best i&#x27;ve had, i&#x27;ve used American Crew Fiber, Got2be Glued and a few other waxes. This one works real well it gets my hair to go directions it doesn&#x27;t naturally go so that&#x27;s good. The two problems I have with it is although this is a strong point for some it makes your hair real matte to the point where it seems like your hair might be dyed but maybe it&#x27;s just me using a bit too much product. The main thing that bothers me is if you use a good amount in your hair you&#x27;ll have to shampoo twice and condition everytime you want to get it out to get your hair back to it&#x27;s natural softness. I&#x27;m no hair expert but I believe you aren&#x27;t suppose to condition every day there is a plus though because it doesn&#x27;t feel bad to sleep in for those late nights when you&#x27;re too lazy to wash it out. Overall it&#x27;s a great product and I would buy again even with the minor problems.</li>
            <li> Really nice. The wax sets in hard though so a need to be fast while styling helped me. A little hard to remove from hair at first, took me two shampoos, so a small pea sized amount works for me, an amount taking half of your index finger might work for you. Good spikes easy to be made and presumably slicked back hair or other styles might work too, will try with this.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome it holds your style without the hard gel texture, makes your hair look like it naturally grows in the style you make it. It smells good and maintains your look all day and you can even mess with  your hair and still be able to style it back to the way it was without applying more of the product. The only missing star, that they should have this item for a better price because its a little over priced if you ask me. Still recommend it though.</li>
            <li> Great product! The hold is great better than got2b glued, why although got2b glued gives mw the desired look it gets sticky after a while l. Gatsby spiky edge gives a good hold but ni sticky feeling I can put my hands through it.PERFECT.if you have short hair short enough for a faux hawk look no further try this.the smell is great like green apples very fruity .</li>
            <li> This product is really good. The delievery is really fast. I would highly recommend this hair wax to my friends.</li>
            <li> This is the best hair stuff ive ever used. It lasts about 3 months depending on how you use it, i use it every day.</li>
            <li> Everything went very smooth.  The ordering and buying was easy.  I received the package when it was promised.  I will order from this place again</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave any white pieces on your hair. Dissolves homogeneously, good quality and hold. It also smells pretty good. Definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Works well but leaves hair feeling sticky all day</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used lots of different hair product over the years, and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever bought the same product twice. Most days, my hair was hit-or-miss depending on how much product I used, whether my hair was a bit wet, how far Jupiter was from Mars... I thought it was just me.  Then I stumbled upon this Gatsby hair cream. Oh, how things have changed. My hair is thick and other gels either weigh the hair down too much in order to keep its shape or are too light and my hair just flops down by noon.  Enter Spyky Edge. It doesn&#x27;t matter how much or little I think I need, I just rub it between my palms and shove it into my hair. Magically, my hair looks great! Every single time with minimal effort.  Bonus, it smells like fresh apples! Only downside is that the packaging make it look like a woman&#x27;s face cream. Whatever.</li>
            <li> Been ordering Gatsby for years now; probably over 6. I will say, through those years and even earlier, I&#x27;ve yet to find a product that can work with my unruly Asian coarse hair that could easily be made into a paint brush!</li>
            <li> I like it, it get the job done, the only complain is that you HAVE to wash your hair, with a good shampoo, this stuff is hard to wash off.</li>
            <li> Ive had this product for a couple of months now, I dont like using products that make my hair looks greasy or too incredibly wild for I work in customer service in a professional setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is good, it makes your hair look like it has natural volume and you can get that clean cut asian style hair or a pretty gnarly grungy look. you dont need much, about a fingertip spread over your palm will do. I work it from the back of my hair towards the front so my bangs dont look stiff.&lt;br /&gt;It takes some experimenting but Gatsby is much better then other hair products I have used. Good hold through out the day and a very cool look.&lt;br /&gt;This is hair wax so it will make your hair feel a little stiff but its nothing near what gel or hair spray does.&lt;br /&gt;Gatsby products are fantastic! Always worth the buy!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  I have short hair and it gives it style and hold all day. And I can rework it throughout the day and it looks better and better.  I&#x27;m on my 5th container and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is my go to hair wax.  I like the product so much I purchased 2 other Gatsby hair wax products for different looks and hair lengths.  I usually wear my hair short but as it grows longer I like a product that can handle the weight and length better.  For my short hair days and any other time I want a super hold I use this product.  It does not take a lot to do what it is suppose to do, and it does it very well.  It last at least 2 months for me and I wash my hair at least 1 per day and generally 2 per day.  The wax is a lot different from most wax products on the market and it does have a rubbery feel to it once your hair is styled.  The hold last all day and the hair does not feel like rock hard spikes even though you can shape it spiky.  When you wash your hair it does feel like it does not all come out, but that is only when it is wet.  Once your hair is dry it does not feel like it has any wax in it.  I apply the wax when my hairs is sort of wet and it looks and feels great.  I believe the hold is slightly better if you apply it on hair that is dry.  I do not use a hair dryer so I have no idea how that works with the wax.  I don&#x27;t think one is needed because even with the hair sort of wet, not dripping wet, you can style your hair and it drys just like you styled it.  This is really a great product, especially if you wear your hair short and just use your hands to shape your hair and style it.  It is the ultimate man hair wax!</li>
            <li> This is very strong stuff. It holds well and does what it is supposed to do. This is especially good for controlling shorter asian hair that seems to grow straight out and not down. The downside to this product is that it makes your hair feel very dry after using it, and it kind of hard to wash out. If the hold isn&#x27;t strong enough for you, I recommend leaving the container open for a day or two. This dries to wax somewhat and gives it more strength (although it is slightly harder to work through your hair). The product is very matted with no shine at all. If you need something stronger than this with minimal shine, I recommend d:fi extreme hold styling cream, which provides an extreme hold with a low shine. However, the shine is not as low as gatsby moving rubber spiky edge. Over all you should use spiky edge if you have hard to control hair and just need something that works. The product is cheap and you are definitely getting your money&#x27;s worth. Only thing I didn&#x27;t love was this product took a long time to ship.</li>
            <li> love every drop of these moving rubber!!</li>
            <li> Great product! great hold, I&#x27;ve never had a product with such good hold while leaving my hair flexible, and good price!</li>
            <li> Stuff is strong. I have long, thick asian type hair and they stuff holds it right where i want it while allowing it to be slightly molded.</li>
            <li> I have thick (naturally) blonde hair almost 4 inches long. This is definitely the best stuff I have found so far, but it isn&#x27;t perfect for sure. When I use this with the right amount, my hair looks product-free (which is great) but it doesn&#x27;t hold perfectly. I have to use more to get it to hold firm, and when I do, my hair gets that thick, clumped up look that I&#x27;m trying to avoid. I would recommend this, but I am going to keep looking once I finish this.</li>
            <li> I enjoy this product, I don&#x27;t even need to use hairspray. My stylist of 8 year turned me on to this product. He only had one of these and stated he was testing it out to see if he wants to carry it in his salon. I had the privilege of him testing it out on my hair. BOY DID IT WORK AMAZINGLY! And he only had to use very little of it to style my hair, that is an added bonus. &#x3D;-) In a world of having to use too much of something kind of helps it be wasted/used faster. Oh and I found it online for an inexpensive price. Since I&#x27;ve had it, I have only had to use the product that gets stuck to the top cover of the container. I haven&#x27;t even dipped my fingers into the main portion of the jar container. And I style my hair daily. Now that is another AMAZING thing. I am a converted product user for sure. &#x3D;-)</li>
            <li> I brought this product because this is an Asian product and claims it works well with  Asian hair. It didn&#x27;t hold up my hair as the day went on. It only took a couple of hours before my hair started falling down. It is also expensive for the amount they give you. It washed off better than other waxes and it has an apple smell. If you want hold, I would go with hair glue instead.</li>
            <li> Too hard to wash off.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. One dime size is all I need to style my thick mop of hair and keep it in place all day. I&#x27;m able to create waves with my straight hair by just applying this product and twisting .</li>
            <li> this is by far the best line up of hair products i have ever come across&lt;br /&gt;if you want the hair of the gods and angels singing when you look into the mirror&lt;br /&gt;with a dozen doves releasing this is the product for you&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;warning: your hair must be godly&lt;br /&gt;may be too powerful of a product for you&lt;br /&gt;might wanna try got2b if it is in fact that powerful</li>
            <li> Perfect for men who are looking for stylish hair, but don&#x27;t put it too much ;)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Moving Rubber, mostly Spiky Edge, for about eight years now, ever since discovering it as a Mormon missionary in Japan. A strong, dry, and &amp;quot;rubbery&amp;quot; hold that lasts all day while retaining much of its initial pliability. The subtle apple scent is a nice touch.</li>
            <li> My son loves this product for his hair.</li>
            <li> i enjoy this product&lt;br /&gt;it is by far the best for my hair&lt;br /&gt;i used lots of hair gel. moose, or hair fiber, but none work the way i want them to&lt;br /&gt;this is it, this is for keep, and for a long time to come people</li>
            <li> I have tried many other hair spiking product agents, and no other has even come close to how good this one is. I have very thin blonde hair and this product just works. I rock a faux hawk and it holds all day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other products like Got2Be and many other gels that I use just make me spikes look clumpy and make me look like im thinning. This product actually volumes my hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best wax. Excited to try their other products as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a white guy with thin brown hair and this stuff works great for my hair style, perhaps I&#x27;ll attach a photo of what my hair looks like before and after I use this stuff. Maybe later.  Smells great by the way, not too strong but the smell lingers in a good way. Not a girly smell either, i&#x27;d describe it as a unisex smell i guess?  It&#x27;s really tough to wash out though.   Very unique texture, unlike anything I have ever tried before and it seems like i&#x27;ve tried it all.  Give it a shot! I plan on trying more Gatsby products in the future.</li>
            <li> this is the BEST hair styling product i have ever used. ive tried MANY different hair products but this product went beyond my expectations. it has very good hold and your hair will stay up all day and you dont even need hairspray. i went to sleep with this product still in my hair and my hair looked the same when i woke up. also this hair wax does not make your hair look oily or greasy and you dont need much to style your hair because this wax is very effective. i have thick,and coarse Asian hair and this product is perfect for me. the only reason i gave this product 4 out of 5 stars because it is hard to wash this stuff out of your hair. but other than that i recommend this product to everyone</li>
            <li> The shipping was nice n&#x27; easy. No problems whatsoever.   The product itself has a pleasant, but faint apple smell. The hold is solid, yet flexible. Which is great in my book since I can&#x27;t stand hair care products that make my hair as stiff as a rock.   I&#x27;ve seen many reviewers comment on it being \\&quot;too oily,\\&quot; but this product has actually had the OPPOSITE effect on my hair. It actually looks very matte! I was going to go for the Gatsby \\&quot;Grunge Mat\\&quot; since many people said Spiky Edge was a bit oily, but it isn&#x27;t oily at all.   I&#x27;ve also seen many reviewers talking about how hard it is to wash out. It washes out just fine for me. Maybe those people don&#x27;t use shampoo? No clue.  Overall, this is a solid product for it&#x27;s price. It&#x27;s great for shorter hairstyles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been working my way through numerous brands of waxes, mouse, gel, until I found this product. I&#x27;ve been using Gatsby for 5 years now, and I haven&#x27;t needed anything else. This product is strong, matte, lasts all day, and smells great (like apples). It lets me style any which way I choose, rearrange my hair multiple times a day, and all of this without making my hair look greasy, which is a problem for me with my slick black hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One complaint I do have is that it is now an add-on item. It never used to be an add-on item, but now I cannot buy it on it&#x27;s own. It&#x27;s not too bad, because I don&#x27;t need to buy it so often, and when I do buy it, it&#x27;s usually not an emergency. But it is a slight inconvenience to an otherwise great product.</li>
            <li> Its okay.thought it would be  diffrent from the stuff i used before,it has like a cream consistency that i dont like</li>
            <li> been using this product for almost a year now, been always trying out other products, to see if i like it better, but ive been always coming back to this product!!. strong hold and flexible on the hair.. stays on all day and easy to come off in shampoo</li>
            <li> I thought I liked this product until I started noticing it flaking after a bit of manipulation. Am I doing something wrong? How come no one else has noticed this? This product does have nice hold, but the flaking is a turn off to the product. Looks like it&#x27;s back to american crew fiber for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using gatsby moving rubber spyky edge for 4 years now and it has to be my favorite hair product hands down. I feel like this has a stronger and longer lasting hold than the gatsby wax and prefer this over the wax. I&#x27;ve tried many many many other hair gels and waxes. This doesn&#x27;t leave your hair hard and crusty or wet. This helps you to get a cool asian hair styled look. I also use hair spray along with it to assure my hair is perfect the entire day. This is a must buy in my book. Don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever use any another styling product than this and other gatsby products.</li>
            <li> One of the best hair gels I have ever bought. It holds my hair all day long however I want it. Generally I have trouble finding a good gel, but Gatsby is AMAZING!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this product in a long time. Probably 5 years ago. I always loved the moving rubber series. I tried most of the options from the pink, to purple, and even the blue gel. The pink one is best for short hair while I used the purple when I have medium to long hair. This is a great product to try at least once.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. Before this I was having to use hairspray and gel to get my hair the way I wanted. I had also tried the products by axe with no avail.Now, all I need is less than a dime size amount of this stuff to do the same job. The only problem I have is that if I wet my hands to try and re-style it, it doesn&#x27;t work well. Other than that it holds up all day and doesn&#x27;t give your hair that hard crusty feeling. The container lasts me well over 3 months of every day use.</li>
            <li> This was is good for making your short hair stand up without looking greasy or hardened. It feels slightly rubbery, which should be no surprise given the name. I will constantly restock this product. However, I usually see it for much lower prices in nearby Asian grocery stores, so if you have any of those nearby you can save some bucks.</li>
            <li> THE ONLY PRODUCT I USE FOR MY KOREAN HAIR.  I DON&#x27;T USE MUCH AND HAVE THIS STOCKED UP.  I DON&#x27;T HAVE A CRAZY KOREAN HAIRSTYLE RATHER IT&#x27;S JUST A NATURAL HAIRSTYLE.  THIS PRODUCT KEEPS THE SIDES OF MY HEAD DOWN.</li>
            <li> I have short hair.&lt;br /&gt;It does not have good hold at all.&lt;br /&gt;Gave my hair an oily feeling especially at the end of the day, pain in the butt to wash out.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is sweet (not masculine) and overbearing for me being a guy its all I smell during the day not what I want.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my boyfriend who has &#x27;asian&#x27; hair and was having trouble finding a product that would work but still remain pliable. He loves it and one container lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li> They mold the hair fine but take away the natural shine and make hair look like it needs washing. I like the fact that it&#x27;s not too greasy but it definitely stays in the hands when you touch your hair.</li>
            <li> Great for spiking up short/medium hair. I use it to style my fohawk and it stays up all day with only a small amount of product (about the size of a quarter). Less is more in this case as if you apply too much it gets harder to style your hair.  The wax is pretty water resistant/sweat resistant once it dries, but when first applying it, do not get it wet or it won&#x27;t hold as well. I find it helps to wet my fingertips with a little bit of water before spreading the product on my hands as it makes it easier to work with. Helps me spread the wax out thinner and work it into my hair. The wax has a slight smell to it, but nothing bad. You get used to it. Washing out the wax is pretty easy. I wash my hair first with bar soap, which works better than shampoo at getting the wax out, then follow up with shampoo.  I&#x27;ve tried only a few different brands of hair gel/wax products and was fortunate to stumble onto this early in my search for a go-to product and have since stuck with this. It&#x27;s cheap ($10 on Amazon as of my purchase, $13 at local stores) and a little goes a long way. Provides great hold and does what it was meant to do and keeps doing it long after the day has ended.</li>
            <li> I bought this stuff to use when I do french twists. I initially opened the package and after seeing the stuff, didn&#x27;t think it would really hold my hair well. But when I put it in my hair, it worked wonderfully! It does make your hair sticky (of course), but it doesn&#x27;t really make it look greasy anything. The packaging is nice and it smells great too. Overall, I am very pleased with the product!</li>
            <li> My husband uses this gel daily. It was hard to find one that would hold his hair all day but this does the job. A little goes a long way with this rubber wax so it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best hair product I&#x27;ve ever tried - you get amazing hold with only a tiny amount so the little tub goes a really long way, and it even smells nice! I&#x27;ve got quite thick hair that is very hard to manage, to the extent that I had to use hard wax in order to get a style to hold. This product is only slightly less strong than that, but it is still strong enough to get my hair to spike up and stay that way and best of all it doesn&#x27;t make it hard or greasy to the touch.</li>
            <li> The best hair styling wax for me! This Japan-made product surpassed all american hair product I know. superb!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for something to give your hair a nice hold, this is a great product.&lt;br /&gt;But, I&#x27;ll tell you right now that you&#x27;re going to have a hard time getting it out. It works so well, that 2-3 washes later&lt;br /&gt;you can still feel it in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;It also makes your hair feel pretty gross.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, it was a little too much.</li>
            <li> For the past couple of years I was using crew creams and they did a perfect job, but I didn&#x27;t really like the fact that it left your hair a bit shiny, even the ones that advertised making your hair look &amp;#34;matte&amp;#34;. I discovered this hair wax while watching youtube videos and decided to give it a try. If you style your hair  up then this is a good product for you. It looks like lotion but when you rub it between  your hands it turns sticky and slightly pink/white, but surprisingly goes on clear once you work it into your hair. It feels a bit greasy but has VERY little shine. My hair did look matte and it made my hair look natural as if I wasn&#x27;t wearing any products. I would definitely recommend you guys try it!</li>
            <li> excelent product my hair enjoy it great comfort and easy aplication of the product let me more time to another things</li>
            <li> Pretty good for my asian hair.</li>
            <li> I also bought some of the other Gasby&#x27;s and they all do nothing. I&#x27;m not quite sure why it gets such good ratings. The product is just like any american crew or bed head. All of these brands are not nearly as strong enough to give mold my air and still give it a dry look.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! It has a pliable, flexible, matte looking hold perfect for creating pieced, spiked, messy hairstyles. Works so well for straighter Asian hair compared to the products you would normally available in your local drugstore, supermarket, or big box store.</li>
            <li> This product is okay. When rubbing it onto your hands it&#x27;s almsot dry by the time you run it into your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also a pain in the butt and builds up and doesn&#x27;t wash out. The best thing is to use condtioner first then shampoo to lubricate the hair to get it out better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I switched to suavecito and its much better. Same firm hold but washes out no problem</li>
            <li> This wax holds up well for my Asian hair. It&#x27;s strong, so expect it to feel sticky, especially after you apply it and you haven&#x27;t gotten used to the feeling yet. It holds up for the entire day without losing its hold or style. It is a bit sticky, which some people may not like. It feels like there is a little bit of residue left after washing it away, but nothing to be afraid of. I think if that concerned you, you could wash your hair twice. Me, after I use my conditioner, I don&#x27;t notice it anymore.</li>
            <li> Holds my hair pretty well. Definitely feels rubbery though... Don&#x27;t know if I like that, but I suppose it&#x27;s a matter of Look, but don&#x27;t Touch!</li>
            <li> At first I made the mistake of applying too much at once but now I know: USE ONLY TINY PINCHES AT A TIME.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, this is a fantastic hair product and I&#x27;m willing to only order this to style my hair. I tend to use this during my morning grooming ritual and it keeps my hair in place just the way I like it all day. When choosing my next permanent hair product, it was between this and Murray&#x27;s. Tried both of them and this hands down beats Murray&#x27;s due to the fact that it&#x27;s much easier to clean out and it smells rather nice too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A note about myself: my hair is grows straight out and is very thick. I&#x27;ve tried many other hair styling products.</li>
            <li> gatsby hair wax. its pink, its the actual thing. 11 more words 1 32 9mdf sad , cd cw q</li>
            <li> I live in japan, and I can buy this product for a slim 210... so it&#x27;s strange to see it for this price, but it is fantastic stuff. 4 stars for the markup.  Edit: Woops I just noticed the size of the product.. much larger size than I buy... So the price is fair! Buy it people. Very unique product!</li>
            <li> The best product for my asian, thick, straight hair. I don&#x27;t spike my hair, but use it to keep my hair and part in place.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used countless amounts of hair products (I have asian hair) and honestly thank god everyday for introducing me to this product. It is nothing short of amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Holds for a while and leaves  nice glossy finish.</li>
            <li> You can never go wrong with Gatsby hair care products. I have every colour of Moving Rubber there is and can&#x27;t say enough good things about them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure to check on their website because they have a style guide on how to use each type of their product. It is incredible how good these products are if you use them correctly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve got all of my stylists to use them and they love them as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say enough good things about these products.</li>
            <li> Creamy compared to the other products.</li>
            <li> I wanted something that wouldn&#x27;t run when wet. This does exactly that. I went to the beach and got wet. When I came out of the water, my hair was still in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you apply it, it&#x27;s like a cream and when it dries it has a rubber feel to it.</li>
            <li> Used a few products from their line and not a big fan of this one. Applied it throughout and the damn thing is as stubborn as my hair. The &amp;#34;moving rubber&amp;#34; moniker is never truer than it is with this product because that&#x27;s exactly how it felt like: covering my hair in rubber. Pulled a few strands out applying it the first time. It also gave my hair a dusty dry look, but fade after an hour or two. Now, I use it as sort of a complement to the other gatsby product to tame the more stubborn parts.</li>
            <li> Great lasting holding power</li>
            <li> This stuff seems a bit different than the harder wax products, but still works like a charm. This stuff makes your hair stiffer than the other waxes. Glad I discovered it.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my son, he complained that his hair was too &amp;#34;coarse&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;rough&amp;#34;. The day we got it, he used it before going out to a party, apparently he got a lot of compliments, works for me so long as he stops complaining.</li>
            <li> This was perfect, I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 weeks days now and it holds amazingly throughout the day. It smells amazing and it washes off in the shower quite well unlike most greasy waxes that you get at the store. It gave me a matte dry that didn&#x27;t look like i was trying to hard, and that&#x27;s the first rule to being cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It will probably be used everyday for the next month too and still have enough for a few more days! This is a great value, and i found myself using a whole lot less product than my other Gatsby products (preferably the pink and green jars), it just gets a little tough to wash out because of the extra texture, but all good it still washes out easy overall.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty good product. I bought it after being disappointed with two Axe Pomades that used to be great and now they can&#x27;t hold any hair of mine. I know it says Spiky Edge but I used mine to do a side part hair style and it worked pretty great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Easy to style&lt;br /&gt;Long Lasting Hold&lt;br /&gt;Can still adjust hair without messing up the style and hold&lt;br /&gt;Not sticky to apply&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;I have to shampoo twice to get rid of it.</li>
            <li> I love this product!!!  It has a sweet scent.  This product makes styling my hair very easy.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This stuff works wonders on my thick hair. Strong enough to hold for an entire day. Probably the best product I&#x27;ve used in a long time. It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but totally worth it!</li>
            <li> The second time order and im very pleased thank you</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of gel and Gatsby is my next default. This is a great gel if you&#x27;re looking for a little casual look but still have that hold.</li>
            <li> this is the only product that keeps my baby hairs in place!</li>
            <li> Spiky hair?? This stuff leaves hair soft. It doesn&#x27;t spike up at all! I tried it on my 6&amp;8 yr olds :(</li>
            <li> My hair is 1-2 inches, extremely thick and I prefer the spiky look.  Over the past year, I have been in search of the \\&quot;perfect\\&quot; hair creme/wax which provides the highest hold and a matte look.  In short, there are lots of options that function very differently.  To date, I have tried American Crew Fiber, D:fi D:sculpt, TIGI matte separation, Moving Rubber Spiky Edge, Moving Rubber Grunge Mat, Jonathan Dirt, Sticky Rice, TRENDStarter matte finishing wax and Eufora Hero.  All of these options are priced in the same range (per oz) but each have a unique set of pros and cons.  I&#x27;m still searching for the silver bullet (for my hair type and style).  For Spiky Edge, here&#x27;s the breakdown:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s the \\&quot;actual\\&quot; hold like?  Very bad, which is surprising given that Moving Rubber marks this at a 9/10 hold.  In contrast, Grunge Mat is far, far stronger than this product (which Moving Rubber ranks as a 10/10).  There&#x27;s apparently a huge different between the 9 to 10 on this scale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How easy is it to work into the hair?  Very easy.  This product has a thin, creamy texture that is very easy to spread into the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How natural does the hair feel throughout the day?  Very unnatural.  Because this product is not very strong, you will need a lot of product to achieve a hold.  In turn, you will get a lot of crunchiness and the \\&quot;wet look\\&quot; - effectively defeating the whole matte theme of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is the hold consistent? Partially.  You will notice that the hold weakens throughout the day but you can counter by applying more product.  I did notice that this particular product seems to lose it&#x27;s hold much faster when you&#x27;re exposed to moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How much do you need to get a decent hold?  A lot.  This product should only be used for people with very short hair (&lt;1 inch).  If you do have very short hair, most of the above criteria will not matter in which case it actually is a solid contender.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it wash out easily?  Yes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How does it smell? Fantastic and very unique.  I would describe it as milky and floral.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please see my other reviews to compare against all of the above products.  Overall, this is a great product.  It&#x27;s real life use, however, this product should only be for people with the shortest of hair (&lt;1 inch).  If you like this manufacturer and need more hold (for slightly longer hair), check out Grunge Mat.  I would rate this 5 stars but, given I wouldn&#x27;t call the \\&quot;hold factor\\&quot; a 9/10 (more like a 7/10), I&#x27;m docking by one star.</li>
            <li> Amazing how little of this product i needed to keep my hair in place!&lt;br /&gt;I had very very short hair when i started using this product, but to my comfort it was really good, nice smell, but don&#x27;t abuse it, don&#x27;t put too much because you are going to have an undesired result, so as long as you go little by little testing how it works for you, that&#x27;s how you can improve your chances of getting the most out of this nice product!&lt;br /&gt;great job!</li>
            <li> Quite disappointed in this product! I have extremely short hair, and this does NOT provide the &amp;#34;maximum hold&amp;#34; as touted ( it also leaves the hair somewhat greasy-looking, even when using the smallest amount as is recommended on the jar) I cannot recommend this to anyone if a maximum hold is your goal as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using bedhead wax for quite a long time. The problem with that is, it would go flat after a few hours. This stuff keeps your hair looking freshly done. I have thick asian hair and it is perfect. I will be buying these strictly from now on.</li>
            <li> I have been using Gatsby Moving Rubber since high school and have not turned back from it!  I use the Spiky Edge to keep my hair designed for casual and professional settings.  Note that Spiky Edge is usually for shorter hair.  Gatsby also has products for longer hair and different effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Putting a little bit on and spreading it on your palms creates a hold that lasts all day.  Spiky Edge does not provide that much shine, unless you apply a ton of it (which you don&#x27;t need at all).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best part is there is so much in there that you can use this for months without having to worry about it running out.  I am very pleased with Gatsby&#x27;s Moving Rubber!</li>
            <li> This stuff helps my hair so much. Since my hair is flat I always put the wax on my hair to volume it up, and hairspray. It makes me look like a different person! Will buy again once I run out.</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff. I have used Crew Fiber (blue top) for years. This isnt quite the same as it is more creamy but i love the way it works. Has a really subtle scent and looks nice. I will say that you need a lot of shampoo to get it out of your hair though. Definitely not as greasy as a lot of products though.</li>
            <li> I recently shaved my head and it&#x27;s starting to grow back.  I&#x27;ve got thick curly hair and this stuff has worked really well for spiking my hair.  Definitely glad I bought it!</li>
            <li> I ordered the pink one and got the purple one. I do like the purple one, but I wanted to try something different.</li>
            <li> Came as expected from Gatsby. I&#x27;ve been using this product for a while now and it still tames my unruly hair.</li>
            <li> Great for my thick hair. Keeps it stuck in place. Though after is dries you don&#x27;t want to move it. It gets fluffy and weird if you move it after it dries. But say you wake up with beadhead now waxed into place. Just water it again, comb, and viola! Perfect hair! Don&#x27;t judge me, sometimes I have to be places soon.</li>
            <li> Awesome. High quality</li>
            <li> One of the best hair waxes I have used. Works very well on medium (4-5in) hair. Smells of green apples, but the fragrance fades rather quickly.&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;-good hold&lt;br /&gt;-nice smell&lt;br /&gt;-large size&lt;br /&gt;-not sticky&lt;br /&gt;-matte&lt;br /&gt;-easy to wash&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;-&amp;#34;melts&amp;#34; or softens and turns slightly greasy in the sun or heat&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall 4 stars. The one con isn&#x27;t too bad beacuse it has to be fairly hot (I live in cali) for that to happen.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m from Sweden and it has been really hard to find a good hair wax product that doesn&#x27;t feel too unnatural when applied. Most product I have tested have either been too hard or too sticky, and not easy to apply evenly. I stumbled upon this when my previous hair wax ran out during a trip to Japan, and the first use was an AMAZING revelation. This makes your hair easy to form and forget, it naturally get imbedded into the hair and you shape it they way you want and it will stay that way for the rest of the day in a natural way. It won&#x27;t be stiff, your hair will feel just as normal, just that it won&#x27;t be completely flat. The pink version is normally for people with shorter hair and is the one most widely used, there are many other versions also and you&#x27;ll probably be able to find one that fits your hair and hair style.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. I have very stiff east Asian hair that I keep no longer than an inch and a half or so, and have struggled to find a hair product that would do anything to my hair that it did not already feel like doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Great styling ability - even with my stiff hair, it can sculpt and hold its shape. Stays pliable throughout the day - my previous very thick gel would work for the first couple hours of the day, but then be useless for the rest. Goes on with a matte finish - no 50s slicked-back hair shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Waxy hair feel&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on a quick estimate with this, my first tub, I&#x27;d say this should last me around three months or so. Definitely reasonable for its &amp;#60;$10 price tag.</li>
            <li> Awesome Product !!&lt;br /&gt;Gives 24 hours of hold&lt;br /&gt;Increases volume of my hairs&lt;br /&gt;Good for short to medium hairs and also for curly hairs..</li>
            <li> Great product but unfortunately not made for people with natural curly hair.</li>
            <li> Best of the bunch, I bought most of the Gatsby products but I like my hair pretty short, Asian hair, this stuff is the best of the lot for me.  Distributes nice and evenly due to consistency.</li>
            <li> I discovered this product after living in Korea. I used to use American Crew forming cream. Once I came back to the States I was pleased to find out that Amazon sells Gatsby products.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the only hair product I use now. I prefer the grey one (for a more matte finish) but the pink one is usually cheaper. You can&#x27;t go wrong with both.</li>
            <li> Best, best, best hair wax I have ever used.  Have been ordering Gatsby for a couple of years and will continue to use.  Love this stuff as you can refresh your style just by rubbing your hands through your hair.  Awesome stuff!</li>
            <li> Best stuff to use for my hair, holds for most of the day</li>
            <li> good smell, keeps hair style longer, perfect hair wax.</li>
            <li> Just like it says. Strong hold, low shine. I was previously using American Crew Fiber but wasn&#x27;t totally satisfied. This stuff is exactly what the doctor ordered.</li>
            <li> This is actually a great hair product.  I usually take half and put water in it so that its not so sticky.  The only thing I did not like about this wax is that it made me break out when I sweat.</li>
            <li> Non-greasy, it won&#x27;t melt in 100-degree heat and most important of all IT HOLDS! I&#x27;ve tried AXE hair putties and whatnot but Moving Rubber works great on my straight hair. I have oily hair but that does not compound the problem at all. 5 out of 5 stars !</li>
            <li> I love this &amp;#34;moving rubber&amp;#34;. It will feel sticky but once it&#x27;s on your hair it is so easy to style because it can be moved! Does not leave flakes and has no bad smell. I have short hair and I use this product to spike my hair all the time!</li>
            <li> applying it is straight forward...use a little and work into hair, then i will take a tiny bit more and lather in my hands to form the final look of my hair. hold is ok. smell is great. feel of hair with it in is so so but the real killer is trying to get it out! I had to wash my hair 3 times before it felt like it was mostly out...not all the way out but mostly out. I used very little of this stuff. I wont be using this stuff again as it is obviously to harsh on my hair if i need to wash 4-5 times to get it all out. About me/my hair....caucasian male, coarse blonde hair. short. usually do a messy spike. worked good for the look i wanted...just a nightmare to get out.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. I have really thick hair and just a little dab of this stuff keeps my hair under control. I also like that it has a matte finish so it doesn&#x27;t really look like you have any product in your hair. It smells pretty good too!</li>
            <li> This is great for my short wavy hair, it keeps it in place wonderfully.</li>
            <li> Product in good order, came a little late but overall great</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s awful! it&#x27;s used and opened! it&#x27;s sticky! my God!</li>
            <li> This is my first time buying any wax products for my hair and I was using gel for the longest time. I needed something new cause I hated that gel wet look so I looked into this and bought it. When the package came in I was very sure that I wasted my money because I&#x27;m pakistani and I have short thick hair which makes it hard to styler.  I took two finger worth of the product and thought it wouldn&#x27;t be enough but started rubbing it in my hand and ran it through my hair. Immediately I fell in love with the product because not only get my hair up in a very small amount but it just looked fantastic and made my hair look casual. I honestly didn&#x27;t even need 2 finger worth of it cause it so strong of a hold. I love the product and love the strawberry yogurt smell and I&#x27;ll for sure be buying this again.</li>
            <li> It was worth a try but oily and not my type of wax</li>
            <li> All I can say is wow. I bought this product for my 3 and 4 yrs. old girls. They like to roll around and play constantly and it was a chore trying to keep their edges laid down and stop them from becoming fuzzy. I have been through EVERY edge control product made for curly and /or African American hair. None of them hold a candle to this stuff. Their hair looks incredible now. I also tried it on my 3a-3b hip length curly hair to give my hair height in the front and sides and it works beautifully. I want to try all the pomades now.</li>
            <li> Works exactly as promised! Smells great! Though even my hair is so fine it still kind of falls a little bit, I can keep touching it up... and I mean into the night, but I am a special case. However! I have used all the clays (best for fine hair) and nothing has this hold power and its not a clay. I am actually going to experiment with more of them since they can be inter used and serve specialized purposes and I think thats where my solution lies. I will likely not buy another brand ever again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I can see it in your face, your thinking... I&#x27;ve paid $18 to $23 and this is like half that, no way it works as well. Trust me, your dead wrong!</li>
            <li> If you watch the video on the desktop site (doesn&#x27;t show up on the mobile site for some reason) to the right of all the pictures, it shows a guy applying it to his hair.  If you follow exactly what he&#x27;s doing, it works perfectly and only takes a minute or two.  I&#x27;m impressed with this wax.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a caucasian male with thick, semi-coarse hair. My hair is an inch or two long over my whole head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice smell&lt;br /&gt;Lasts a long time&lt;br /&gt;Good price for the amount you get&lt;br /&gt;Fairly good at molding your hair (if you have fine hair)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t keep the shape for my hair throughout the whole day&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this just wasn&#x27;t thick enough to keep my hair in the same shape for as long as I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> I just absolutely love how fast the item gets to me. I usually order with free shipping but it comes like a day or two earlier than expected arrival date (Maybe because of the area I&#x27;m in...). The product itself is a staple to me everyday. Great hold, it looks natural, no gelly smell, case is like heatproof (like i put it in my apron while pushing carts as a bagger in about 90 degrees), my bed hair looks better than what I usually try to style my hair for.</li>
            <li> Really good for asian hair. Short - Med. length. This product is more matte.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Asian and my hair sticks out and this does a great job of taming my hair especially on the sides. I only need to use a little bit and I&#x27;m good. BUT... I don&#x27;t like the smell of this product. It smells like sour apple and rubber. It makes me sneeze and one time I had a headache. The smell does go away after an hour or so.</li>
            <li> I bought the spiky edge hair wax and it was an alright price for the product. My hair did feel different compared to other gels and wax, as this did not leave a hard, crusty feel to it. However, this sometimes would have that white leftover stuff when applied. It&#x27;s a decent product, just don&#x27;t use too much as a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> My hair sticks straight out when its short and somewhat flattens out as it grows out. This stuff does not work well with my straw like hay hair. I will go back to buzzing it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I will go back to hair gel again after using this hair wax.  It works very well with my straight asian hair.</li>
            <li> It has a strong hold, gives your hair that extra point.  It may be too oily depending on your taste - but not like gel or anything.</li>
            <li> Best Wax/Gel I have ever used.  Unlike gel, this dries without a blow dryer which saves me time in the morning.  One little container will last over 2 months if used conservatively.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for years and at my mid 40&#x27;s, I still love it!  Washes out clean however, best to use deep clean shampoos or dove Fresh Clean 2 in 1 to rid of any build ups.  Gatsby is just great  for asian hair.  It makes thinning hair look fuller for some reason! Somebody already mentioned that  in a review and it&#x27;s true.  I&#x27;m also not near to any Japan Town so amazon is the only place I go and get it.</li>
            <li> My husband husband loves it and it doesn&#x27;t look greasy. :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many different hair wax products. Gatsby comes with in variety of hair wax products. This spiky edge hair wax is great for those people have shorter hair and looking for maximum hold. Additionally, this wax product is less greasier than other products that gatsby offer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very pleased with the product and I highly recommend to my friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Holds hair really well&lt;br /&gt;- Natural look&lt;br /&gt;- long lasting&lt;br /&gt;- smells good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- fairly expensive compared to other hair wax products&lt;br /&gt;- technique sensitive (which is true for any hair styling products)</li>
            <li> Best hair product ever. The only state I&#x27;ve ever found this in in stores is Hawaii. The majority of hair products in the US are inferior to this. It&#x27;s strong, yet doesn&#x27;t make your hair look greasy or feel crunchy.</li>
            <li> Vera good! Perfect product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a hair product that holds strong and is easy to use. It holds all day long with just a little help with hairspray. It smells great, though it does leave a bit of a residual feel. However, it does not flake, and can easily be adjusted throughout the day without loss of holding power. I love it, and will definitely buy it again!</li>
            <li> I have tried many types of gel and even mousse, but this is the best.&lt;br /&gt;Strong hold, no flaking, no discoloration, lasts for a decent amount of time, and you only need a little.&lt;br /&gt;I use it every day and this tiny container can last me around 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great buy.</li>
            <li> Has a weird apple smell but it goes away quickly after putting it in your hair. Works really well for styling thick asian hair, and I only need a fingertip&#x27;s worth so it should last awhile.</li>
            <li> I ordered this not only for my own hair but to style the wigs I use for cosplay.  It works great on both real and the synthetic hair.  Doesn&#x27;t flake and isn&#x27;t too gooey.</li>
            <li> Strong hold as advertised. Doesn&#x27;t leave a shine.</li>
            <li> My favorite hair product ever is no longer made, but this one is my favorite that I can still get. It is harder to wash out and not quite as soft, but the best I have tried so far.</li>
            <li> I cut my hair into a pixie style a few months ago.  I have had long hair my entire adult life and had no clue what types of product to use for the new style.  I researched and have used tons of other stuff and nothing has lived up to the hype until now!  This stuff lets you take your hair to new heights, which is what I was looking for.  I have a lot of hair but it is very fine (probably about 5 - 6 inches long on the top) and other products just weighed it down too much.  It even seems to work well in all of our humidity (south Louisiana - really sticky).  You don&#x27;t have to use a lot either which means it will last.  I would definitely recommend this product and will try the one in the green container also!</li>
            <li> It feels like mousse after it goes on. It has a slightly sticky feels on wet hair.  It hold well but is VERY hard to wash out.    Pink is the strongest with matte.  Purple is strong with shine.  Grey has a bit less hold than purple but is completely matte. And if you want the wet look buy the blue.</li>
            <li> This is pretty much what I expected. I&#x27;ve heard about this product a lot and always wanted to try it. But the price and the seemingly small amount made me hesitant. I use &#x27;ECO Styler&#x27; Great gel,at  $4 for a huge jar that lasts me like 1 to 2 yrs. I got this to pack in with other stuff I needed more to get the over $25 free ship. I watched the video review by that guy..He said it helps hold down Asian men&#x27;s hair from sticking out from the side. I&#x27;m 100% Chinese, and I&#x27;ve never really had a problem with this. Maybe I&#x27;m lucky, I know  ppl that has that problem  though. So I don&#x27;t really need it specifically for that. It does not wash off that easily like he said...Gel washes off easier. It leaves a bit of a residue , you may have to shampoo more than once. This is the thing I don&#x27;t like about it. I&#x27;ll probably keep using my old gel more on a daily basis. I can achieve just about the same result with it. Not a huge difference. I&#x27;ll use Gatsby more sparingly for occasions.Nevertheless this is a great quality product. It really helps control my hair, and give it texture. I recommend it . I&#x27;m just not sure I can justify the price/amount/performance ratio when compared to my old gel.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this on his short textured hair. It holds the style without looking too stiff and also isn&#x27;t greasy. This is the second one he has ordered and he loves it.</li>
            <li> Am a white guy with thickish, dark blond, slightly wavy hair who likes a bit of style in his locks and who lived and worked in Japan for 15 years and so has no romantic notions about the country or care about Cosplay, Anime, Manga or J-anything. I also never used this or any other Japanese hair product while living in the country (in fact, I always used American hair products).  I give you this detail so you can determine if this is the review for you or not.  If you are Asian or simply want the J-look this review may not be for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this product right after a haircut then switch to the purple one when my hair gets longer. Just purchased the green one recently and will probably use it right before a haircut as it is a lighter feeling pomade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Holds great and keeps hair looking good all day long.  The hold and body is unstoppable but doesn&#x27;t feel weird to the touch. It still keeps hair looking great after sleeping on it all night long - just style it again or add a little more.  Doesn&#x27;t leave hair greasy or shiny-looking at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drying to my hair.  I often have to switch out to a non-Gatsby product for a day or two when my hair gets too dry.  This product is not \\&quot;natural\\&quot; in any way which I imagine contributes to the tendency to dry my hair as a pomade with \\&quot;natural\\&quot; ingredients does not dry my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIP&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you find this product difficult to wash out simply work in a little baking soda after lathering with shampoo but before you rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out in and of itself.  Rather, it acts as an accelerator with the sun&#x27;s rays to dry my hair (and bleach the color as well).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for long hair. This REALLY holds your hair. If you are looking for a clean cut look, use this! If you&#x27;re looking for the &amp;#34;I just woke up&amp;#34; look, go for the Wild Shake!</li>
            <li> I used to use another product that is not available any longer. I wasted money on many, many, many products trying to duplicate the same results. Unsuccessful until now!!! Love the hold I get from this product. Perfect for spiking hair and it stays soft enough at first to style then dries and holds. This is my 2nd order..</li>
            <li> VERY TOUGH wax. It&#x27;s good if you want that really really spiky effect. If you want more of a wavy, natural look try the other moving rubbers out.</li>
            <li> Best hair product for straight thick hair. Only con would be how hard it is to clean out of hair.</li>
            <li> Great product! Love it~</li>
            <li> Works great on my short hair. ( about less than 2 inches). It gives a much more cleaner and natural look compared to the hard and wet look you get from gel. Personally I used got2Bglued before this. That works great too, but I definitely prefer Gatsby over got2b mainly because of the texture it gives your hair. If you usually style your hair in a spiky fashion or a faux hawk then I would recommend this to you. However, like many reviews have mentioned..this product is definitely difficult to wash out compared to gel. To wash it out I first shampoo my hair, condition it and run a comb through it as I&#x27;m conditioning it. To sum this product up I would say its a great purchase if you like that more natural look, but if you can&#x27;t take some time out to put a bit more effort into washing your hair then I&#x27;d suggest not to buy this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many, many different types of hair wax and gels, and this tops every single one of them. It&#x27;s so much better than American Brands. I barely have to use any Moving Rubber to get the desired result, with other products, it seems I have to use huge globs to get my hair to do the same thing.</li>
            <li> Look no further.  I&#x27;ve tried at least a dozen different high-end products for my half-asian/half-hispanic head of thick, straight, brown hair, and I&#x27;ve finally found the mecca.  My hair sticks straight out from my head even at 3-4 inches in length.  I look like a punk rocker that used a whole can of hair spray even without any hair product.  I try to go for the textured/tassled look up top, and try to keep the sides closer to my head... this becomes a huge challenge as my hair grows out even 1 week after getting a hair cut, if you have hair like mine, you know how frustrating it is.  Just some of the products I&#x27;ve used/tried:  Bedhead Hair stick/wax  Bedhead manipulator  American Crew Pomade  American Crew Fiber  American Crew Firm Hold styling gel  d-fi dstruct  d-fi extreme  It&#x27;s been several years since I&#x27;ve used the bedhead hair stick, but that was probably the closest comparison to this product, however the usability is miles apart. Gatsby isn&#x27;t a solid like the hair stick, which makes application very easy.  It also doesn&#x27;t clump, surprisingly enough with how thick it is.  It&#x27;s hard to describe the texture as there isn&#x27;t really anything like it.  It is closest to d:fi d:struct in texture, but the way it hold and forms is that of the Bedhead wax.  A very small amount of this product goes a LONG way, more than any other product I&#x27;ve used.  Just stop reading and buy this if you&#x27;ve got thick straight short asian/hispanic hair, and do yourself a favor and buy it now.  Pros  Unbelievable hold (yet not stiff at all) for thick short hair, allowing for cool styles and textures  Easily applied  Doesn&#x27;t clump  Cheaper than the competition  Little amount goes a looooong way  Cons  I didn&#x27;t find it sooner  A little difficult to wash out</li>
            <li> Great product. It really is like using &#x27;moving rubber&#x27;. While other products might harden when set, this stuff kinda sets your hair, but then you&#x27;re still able to move it and reposition at will. It&#x27;s like a good trainer for your hair :) That is pretty impressive technology in my book.</li>
            <li> Said that this crap starts drying as soon as you put it on your hands, you gotta be super quick and if you don&#x27;t your hair if frozen in time forever.</li>
            <li> I have coarse, thick asian hair and I couldn&#x27;t find a product that would work until I found this. This product molds and holds your hair perfectly and it is an all natural matte look. Very low shine. I definetely recommend.</li>
            <li> Like many others, I have tried lots of different hair gels and waxes but none like the Gatsby spyky edge. This product not only does it hold your look in place; it also keeps your hair like that all day without grease feeling or flakes.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work very well on my hair. Doesn&#x27;t seem to add any &amp;#34;controlability.&amp;#34; My hair is a lot stiffer and &amp;#34;puffier&amp;#34; than others. Maybe that&#x27;s the issue. And if I add more, it just feels gross and looks like I rubbed vaseline on my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, if you get rained on (got caught in a freak hail storm), you get gloopy white crud all over you. I looked like I was attacked by a swarm of incontinent birds.</li>
            <li> ive been using this instead of using gel on my hair. it gives it a much nicer look while maintaining the hair style you want without the greasy look you get from hair gels.</li>
            <li> My hair looks awesome and my friends are always curious how it stays up for the entire day</li>
            <li> One application of this product will last you the whole day.  Its styling power will not diminish as the day goes on, leaving you with a freshly styled look all day.</li>
            <li> If you use gel and you don&#x27;t like how it shines and flakes, this is the stuff for you. If you tried wax and it wasn&#x27;t working for you, Gatsby Moving Rubber is easier to apply than wax.</li>
            <li> for short to short-medium hair is very very good, just apply it like the instructions say, just a little bit, if u noticed that need or want more strong strenght to ur hairsatyle, aply a bit more trougn all the hair moving ur fingers into it, and u will have excellent results.</li>
            <li> My brother is quite critical about his hair gels, and stocks up on these whenever he is traveling in Asia. After running out, he demanded ordering these off amazon and is hoarding them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sometimes use it as well and really like the smell of it. It is a bt putty-er than I&#x27;d like but it is the strong hold kind, so that&#x27;s okay. Over all, I enjoy the product. It isn&#x27;t as greasy as many of the typical ones and it looks quite natural.</li>
            <li> This hair wax is very good. It&#x27;s not very stick and easy to wash off from your hands after you are done. This wax made it very easy to mold to the style you want. However, don&#x27;t leave it on overnight, it gets flaky and make it looks like you have dandruff. It works well with short hair and long air</li>
            <li> My hair is pretty thick and I get frustrated when a hair product doesn&#x27;t hold up my hair like I want it to. I&#x27;ve tried many types of hair holding products and they all seem to fail on me until I discovered Gatsby Moving Rubber Hair Wax 4 years ago. It is by far the best and my top favorite hair product I had ever used! Unlike other products, my hair won&#x27;t look greasy, it will hold my hair however I style it, it smells great like green apple and no shine with natural looks. For it&#x27;s reason to be called Moving Rubber, you can shape or mold your hair on the go! A year ago, an empty box fell on my head and flattened my hairdo during work so I just reshaped it back with my hands and fingers! It&#x27;s pretty amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Gatsby for many years and there are some minor flaws but can be fix to enjoy this product even more. Spiky Edge has a pretty strong hold when applying to your palms it tends to pull your hair especially if it&#x27;s medium short hair o_O! With the proper technique, it&#x27;s not a problem. Apply a small pea-size to your palm with Spiky Edge. You don&#x27;t want to put too much you&#x27;ll lose texture and definition to your hair, it&#x27;s better to work with a little amount and add more if needed too. Spread evenly with both palms including and between fingers and start the back of your head with a grab n pull motion with your fingertips to prevent hair pulling. Working your way up to the front. Then start the sides using the fingertips to define the edges of your hair and fringes. No need of hairspray since Spiky Edge holds up pretty well. Occasionally when I have short to medium hair, I use [[ASIN:B000V2ACHI GATSBY MOVING RUBBER WILD SHAKE Hair Wax, 80g/2.8oz]] and Spiky Edge for the shorter hairs to give out a more define look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You should always make sure to close the lid properly after use. One time I accidentally left the lid open before going to work and by the time I arrive home, it gotten dry!!! It still works but it wasn&#x27;t pleasant. So close the lid!!! Also, washing your hair can be a little frustrating because it&#x27;s hard to take off at first. With a little more than average shampoo than you normally use will do the trick.e the lid!!!

            <li> Nothing bad to say about this brand. So I will try and fill up this space. Glove. Hammer. Sweater. Done</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Asian and have been having a hard time finding the perfect hair styling product.  I was looking for a product that felt light in my hair, but was able to manage my shorter hairs, which can be quite stubborn.  I had really high hopes with this product, but it didn&#x27;t really meet my expectations.  Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t manage to tame my short hairs on the back of my head.  However, it did add that classic Asian pop idol texture to my hair, which was new and interesting.  The &amp;#34;texturizing&amp;#34; effect of Gatsby pink is probably it&#x27;s major selling point.  It did feel relatively light in my hair without too much residue or gunkiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For now, I&#x27;m going to stick with Paul Mitchell Men Reformer Strong Hold/Matte Finish Texturizer for Men.  It manages my short hairs better and is equally non-gunky most of the time.  Unfortunately, it can dry out and clump in the container, which can result in white chunks in your hair if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li> A great hair wax, gives a long hold, doesn&#x27;t shine, and smells pretty good. Great value for what it costs.</li>
            <li> I tried a more expensive version of Gatsby and loved it. Then bought this one to try out. Definitely prefer the more expensive one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one was just okay. It did its job, but didn&#x27;t last all day and the smell was just alright. Not bad though.</li>
            <li> Without a doubt, this has strong hold and rlly great for short-medium hair. If you&#x27;re not going for a faux hawk, combover, or any other crazy hairstyle then this product is not for you. Once you apply throughout your hair, literally every hair on your head will stand up</li>
            <li> I recommend the technical design clay by Gatsby. This product is good but I found that it worked the best when left out overnight to harden.</li>
            <li> All I ever use after discovering this. Non greasy but strong and smells fine.</li>
            <li> Best for Asian hair? Well, it does seem to hold until you break a sweat. So, if you&#x27;re more of a cubicle type of guy then it&#x27;s fine. However, if you&#x27;re the active type, like me, and have towel around the neck to wipe off the stinging sweat, this product isn&#x27;t for us. Got2B Glued Spiking Glue is water resistant (sweat resistant) and provides all day hold even in this hot and humid weather. Yes, I&#x27;m a spiky haired asian fella. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much better value and it&#x27;s available at your local CVS and supermarket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Glued-Spiking-Glue-6-Ounce-Tubes/dp/B00QR0BOCA/ref&#x3D;pd_sim_194_5?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;refRID&#x3D;1C44JRXYAZNEPDC3ECNE</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this brand!  It doesn&#x27;t give my hair a shine but it gives it a lot of volume and strength.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I like the Japanese writing on the can so people know this was imported. You don&#x27;t just go to CVS and buy it.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I use it every morning and have all the different style types. Cheap and work super well!</li>
            <li> Not strong enough for my hair</li>
            <li> Love this wax. It is non-sticky and greasy.</li>
            <li> This is a great wax. It smells really nice, doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky residue on your hands, and works great!</li>
            <li> This item does the job holds hair in place. It smells good and easy to wash out. Buy it and try it.</li>
            <li> It is flexible and can provide solid structure if you do not have heavy limp hair or longer than 2.5 inches. I was using this with medium longer hair and while does not have a strong stiff hold, it is still a very good flexible product for creating texture and form without shine or gloss. It looks like white cream, but it goes on clear, leaving no white flakes or residuals (at least that is true when it is used sparingly - I have not tried globs of it). Glad that the green apple smell does not last too long. A little goes a long way- glad that I got Gatsby Moving Rubber Spiky Edge hair wax.</li>
            <li> The hold it amazing. It&#x27;s a must buy wax product!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is my third purchase of the Gatsby Spyky edge. It works best for that fine asian hair, and it has pretty good hold for short hair, and the hold is good for something little longer length. always use some hairspray to lock that style in place. i used other products and for my type of hair it just did not hold it up. American Crew Fiber, Hanz de fuko, would work best for thicker hair but not mine.</li>
            <li> While my hair IS starting to thin, I still have more than enough to style it. Without any product in my hair, I just look flat out lame and a good 10 years older for some reason. I&#x27;ve used gel&#x27;s in the past, but hate how they seem to goop up my hair and also make it hard as a rock, at least the brands I&#x27;ve tried. The best product prior to Gatsby&#x27;s was [[ASIN:B006ZUH2XM Exclusive By Billy Jealousy Headlock Hair Molding Cream 57g/2oz]] ... while it worked good, there was a few drawbacks. For one it was SO thick (the cream/wax itself) that I had to put some in my palm and then add some water to make it manageable enough to spread through my entire head/hair. In addition, I think I accidently got some water in the container because after that, it was no longer usable. It literally turned rock solid in the jar and pretty much glued itself to the container. The other thing I didn&#x27;t like is that it kinda left my hair kinda greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first experience with Gatsby and I love it so far. First off, it smells great. It has a hint of apple smell, but like other said, not SO much that you smell fruity or like a girl lol. 2nd, I LOVE LOVE LOVE the consistency of the product itself... its very creamy &amp; smooth. I also like how I didnt need a ton to spread all over my head. In addition, its not shiny nor rock hard once its set. I can move &amp; style my hair throughout the day. I can even wet my hands and style it even more. I have a buddy who lives in Osaka Japan and swears by this brand (as well as most Japanese-based hair products). I can&#x27;t say I blame him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll definitely be using this brand going forward, at least, while I still have some hair on my head.</li>
            <li> I didnt like this product at first, but i now think it is a good product in its own way. It has the ability to make your hair feel like you put wax in your hair three days ago without washing since; Which is awesome.</li>
            <li> I have thick, asian hair. This stuff will let you style it anyway you want, but hopefully nobody will touch your hair. If anybody runs their fingers through your hair, they will pull their hand away thinking &amp;#34;ewwww.&amp;#34; It leaves your hair a sticky, gooey, gross-feeling mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sticking with american crew products for now.</li>
            <li> Good product for the price, unique smell,it is different, but I like it. Product is a good choice. Also a great price,</li>
            <li> Its better than gel but it wasn&#x27;t strong strong enought to hold certain spots of my hair (my hair is stick) but I could still style it close to what I wanted it to look like. I wanted to try Grunge Mat as it is supposed to be stronger for holding your hair but they where sold out, none the less I liked this product and it was excelent as my firts try from this line of products.</li>
            <li> this stuff is the best, and at a price you can&#x27;t beat. I definitely recommend it to anyone with short spiky hairs</li>
            <li> Good product and hold my hair well.</li>
            <li> Not for long term use. I left it over a month and it became extremely dry and absorb a lot of dust in the air.</li>
            <li> I usually like using wax over gel and this product got the job done! Hair stays up the whole day!</li>
            <li> Use less that you think, and rub in palms until its gone basically, and it works great!</li>
            <li> I wish I could of known of this stuff earlier! Well I&#x27;ve never stumbled upon it here in the states...&lt;br /&gt;Spky Edge is perfect for spikes and those rock star hair types.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though before buying this you must know that this hair will not work well with very thick hair if you apply this to thick hair your hair will just have a mind of its own, plus because of the thickness of the hair the wax can&#x27;t hold on and will just separate and look like you&#x27;ve never applied any at all! So therefore you must either:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Have thin hair. (Thinning can be done with thinning shears)&lt;br /&gt;2. Have straight hair. (Using a straightener)&lt;br /&gt;3. Both. (I&#x27;ve been using the wax for 3 months on thick un-straightened hair only to realize the wax didn&#x27;t work the way i thought since my hair was uncontrollable. So thinning and straightening your hair can really give you that look you&#x27;ve always wanted.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this stuff. I have a tall spiky faux-hawk that stands up about 5-6 inches in the front and I usually prefer pomades, gels, waxes and stying glues with words like \\&quot;extreme\\&quot;, \\&quot;super\\&quot;, or \\&quot;insane\\&quot; contained somewhere in the description of the product&#x27;s intended effect. So then, this product seemed like it was right up my alley. No dice though. Maybe it&#x27;s because I don&#x27;t have Asian hair (Can styling products be racist btw?) Meh. While it&#x27;s not exactly sticky per se, it is...tacky and heavy are probably the best words I can think of to describe the consistency of it on my hair (even using only a dab). It does sticks to itself to an incredible degree (which is I guess where the whole pliable descriptor comes into play). You can literally pull the hair apart and stick it to other hair allowing you to move and sculpt the style of your hair - at will.&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I found the whole experience of wearing the product to be akin to slathering my head with an air and moisture-tight helmet of semi-liquid latex. Seriously, that whole \\&quot;moving rubber\\&quot; thing is NOT just a clever name here.&lt;br /&gt;Some may also have mentioned that this product has a light scent. I would rebut that gross understatement by saying that it reeks of that artificial sour-apple scent that is usually reserve for stuff like jolly rancher candies and possibly children&#x27;s bath products. And that scent Never. Dies. Down. So wearing this product during even a slightly warm-ish day, eventually I always ended up feeling like someone had replaced my hair with a sweaty, candy-stinking, plastic sculpture of its normal self.&lt;br /&gt;So yeah, needless to say; I wasn&#x27;t a fan.</li>
            <li> I’ve been using this product for atleast 3-4 years now so I really know how this product works. First of all the pink gatsby has very strong hold so when applying it tends to pull your hair a lot, if your spreading it with your palms so I suggest the majority of you with medium hair to use the finger tip technique to spread by “pulling” like how you pull flowers to spread the wax. This product is mainly for people with short to medium hair as the gatsby chart proclaims, which be seen here. This product is very good at defining hair spikes and because of that hair spray should not be used with this product it’ll would be redundant to do so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this product you might notice this product is very hard to wash off and sometimes you might even notice hair starts falling off this is probably one of the worse things about gatsby pink because its so good hold its very hard to was off you might have to wash your hair at least quick to get rid of all the products. So one of the techniques that I’ve learned to deal with this problem is to either comb it while washing your hair or wash it first then use the hair straightener heat weakens this product to a point where it no longer provides hold. One more thing this products dries relatively fast so when you’re taking the wax you need make sure you close the container!</li>
            <li> Just like the one from Japan. Good hold, easily refreshed not too greasy.</li>
            <li> Best hair wax I have ever used by far!  Works great on short hair, excellent hold, no flaking. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I bought it because of the great reviews but it did not wowed me as others have described. I have normal Asian hair and it works fine but I have had better.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Smells nice&lt;br /&gt;Easy to style&lt;br /&gt;Comes with plenty of product&lt;br /&gt;Washes out easily&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t hold my style for long. I still need a freezing spray.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair (not thin, but fine) that ranges from wavy to curly on different parts of my head. My hair length ranges from very short on the sides to 2-3 inches long on top. Other products I&#x27;ve used include Sumotech from Bumble and Bumble, Alterna Hemp modeling clay, Alterna hair cement, Sebastian Crude Clay (original), and others. I chose this because others described it as having strong, lasting hold that isn&#x27;t oily or flaky. I recognize that many of the people who like the Moving Rubber have different hair than mine, so I&#x27;m just sharing my experience, not disagreeing with theirs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that it works very well when the air is dry, but when it&#x27;s humid, or whenever I&#x27;m sweaty, it loses its hold and the hair is not reworkable. That said, I&#x27;ve found this to be true of every other hair product I&#x27;ve used (except those that rigidly lock hair in place, such as Got 2B Glue).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One tip: Gatsby Moving Rubber seems to work best with hair that is on the drier side of damp. It must be a little damp, or you can&#x27;t distribute the product properly. But the hair is too wet, my hair becomes floppy and difficult to style. So towel dry your hair and then do something else for a couple minutes. Then use the Moving Rubber.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Asian. This s*** works. If it doesn&#x27;t work for you then... you must be bald.  Plus it smells like apples.  At least to me.  cheers</li>
            <li> It works with great with short/medium length asian hair. It helps maintain your style and control stubborn asian hair. Great buy.</li>
            <li> So, I needed to replace my American Crew Fiber after running out, so I decided to check out Amazon&#x27;s styling product selection. I decided to check this product out because of its popularity and consistently high rating. I&#x27;m not disappointed, and I definitely got a bargain; but seeing this product called &amp;#34;hair wax&amp;#34; I expected something a bit more thick and waxy, like a clay. The texture is fine, I just personally prefer something less goopy. I think a putty would&#x27;ve been a more appropriate moniker. That being said, for a putty and for the price, I&#x27;m quite impressed. Can go in hair either dry or damp. Hair stays in place except in unusually harsh conditions with a more natural, matte appearance and is relatively soft, not stiff and sticky. Great product. Now, does anyone happen to know if Gatsby makes a clay or fiber type product?</li>
            <li> stickier than the green one. great for longer hair!</li>
            <li> I have been using American Crew Fiber.  And I thought I would give this a try.  AC fiber is dry wax that you have to melt in your palms and fingers and when styling your hair it feels very dry and tacky.  However, Moving rubber spiky edge is like pudding.  When you rub the moving rubber in your fingers and palms it becomes more like tooth paste and it is not watery at all.  But it is 2 to 3 times easier to style the hair than AC fiber.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is medium length Asian hair.  I used to keep my hair short because I could not style it because of its coarseness.  I never liked the shiny gel or the hairspray.  But when I found out about the hair wax products I started growing out my hair.  Short hair really doesn&#x27;t flatter a man when he puts on a suit or even a nice dress shirt.  You have to grow it out and part it or do some styling to make yourself look gentlemanly.  So grow it out Asian men.  Have some fun with your hair.</li>
            <li> only things i use now. use sparingly might give you better results.&lt;br /&gt;hair length 2&#x27;&#x27;-5&#x27;&#x27;, very straight, like my side burns grows out straight type. and thick hair.</li>
            <li> Works great for my thick hair.  Great for sculpting a variety of styles and when your hair starts to lose it&#x27;s style, just slightly we hands and rework into hair to reactivate the product.  Very strong, but flexible.  Don&#x27;t leave the lid off though, it will tend to dry out the product.  To alleviate, try adding a small amount of water and replacing lid.</li>
            <li> Definitely will hold your hair the whole day, maybe hairspray will help to keep hairstyle in place the whole day but its an option. Overall great hold with the natural look.</li>
            <li> i use this everyday and pretend i am Goku going from super saiyan level 1 to 3</li>
            <li> This is perfect for my hair. I can shape my hair the way i want and it gives my hair the proper support without having helmet hair due to too much hairspray. Any young Asian man should give this a try. I can&#x27;t believe i didnt find this sooner. Thank you Amazon! Thank you Japan!</li>
            <li> Mandom Gatsby Moving Rubber Spiky Edge is a great product. It really makes my style work. My one complaint is that it takes about three washings to remove the pomade from your hair. But, otherwise I love the product.</li>
            <li> Very good at taming hair. Isn&#x27;t greasy and doesn&#x27;t get stuck in fingers. It&#x27;s also pretty strong and can hold your hair in desirable position for a long time.</li>
            <li> Ita a prett good product but I have about 6inch long hair and it&#x27;s not that effective, I think that this particular product is not meant for such long hair. Keep that in mind I should have researched that part a bit more before committing to buy.</li>
            <li> a bit expensive but this stuff sticks and molds your hair anyway you want it for DAYS. Tried different products and this one is the strongest ever! A little annoying to wash off though.</li>
            <li> Been using it for 2 years, works great. Better than gel, moose, hair spray etc. Positions your hair perfectly without that shiny thinning effect that gel has. I have relatively fine hair as well, and this helps give it a little volume.</li>
            <li> I was going for the d trix hair with this and with the green gatsby and spikes after with this product i got my shine :D</li>
            <li> First off, I have thick asian hair. I have tried out pretty much every gatsby product out there and this is the best one I have used thus far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the beginning, it held my hair in place perfectly. However...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about 6 months of using this product I have noticed that it doesn&#x27;t hold my hair as well. (I&#x27;m still using the original container)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Possible reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) I have grown my hair longer, and perhaps its too thick/heavy now for this product&lt;br /&gt;2) The product degrades/weakens after a period of time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, I will buy a fresh new one and update this review.</li>
            <li> I have wavy-curly, thick hair.  Exactly the worst for modern, Princeton-ish haircuts.  This stuff works and it works without making your hair feel gross to the ladies (wife in my case, full disclosure). It doesn&#x27;t take much.  After a minute or two of a slight strawberry smell, it&#x27;s odorless.  Lasts all day even if you sweat.</li>
            <li> I had tried countless waxes and pomades, but Gatsby is definitely the one to beat. It;s easy to apply and not too shiny, perfect for straight, course, unbelievably damaged hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt; - relatively inexpensive (compared to crew products)&lt;br /&gt; - a little does go a long way&lt;br /&gt; - easy to style&lt;br /&gt; - holds all day&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt; - clumps&lt;br /&gt; - a white paste, so if you miss rubbing in any spots, it will show&lt;br /&gt; - smell, an artificial strawberry starburst type smell that dissipates after a half hour or so</li>
            <li> I have a pixie cut with short, short sides and long in front (5-6 inches), and shorter on the upper top (3-4 inches) of my hair so I can spike it up.  The product is not a wax, nor &amp;#34;rubbery&amp;#34; - the texture is more like a really thick greek yogurt.  It smells like lightly scented fruit shampoo, but once its on my hair the smell dissipates so it doesn&#x27;t leave a lingering odor, which I loved.  My first try I used 2 medium finger dabs starting from the roots to tips.  I used one more application and it spikes my hair up great.  I don&#x27;t wash my hair everyday and really didn&#x27;t need to with this product in my hair.  It didn&#x27;t flake off or leave any residues. It didn&#x27;t feel sticky the day after like hairspray residue. Even after 2 days I could just fluff up my hair, retouch with a flat iron and it looked great.  If I needed to I could just add more dabs to my hair to make it spikier.  I hate using hairspray because of the smell and the way it feels the day after.  I always wash my hair the day after using hairspray, but don&#x27;t need to with Gatsby Moving Rubber.  I was curious about this product because reviews were highly rated for asian hair. I have thick, asian hair, but my hair is normally wavy the longer it gets.  I love that you can still run your fingers through your hair to play with it, and add more product and it won&#x27;t make your head feel heavy or dirty.  I live in the midwest (US) and we have wet springs, cold winters and humid summers, so I will add an update to see how this product holds up to those tough conditions.  So far I really love it.  It&#x27;s better than anything I&#x27;ve tried at retail stores, and about equal to Aveda Control Paste without the high price, and you get more per ounce.  Aveda would leave flakey residues, especially on portions where on the side of my hair is about 1&amp;#34; or shorter.  Gatsby Moving Rubber didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> use it everyday and can not go without it.  Keep three or four in stock at all times in both bathrooms</li>
            <li> Works very well, I&#x27;ve been jumping around different hair gels, pomades, and creams trying to find the right fit. My hair is straight and very hard to keep it in the direction I&#x27;ve wanted it to. There&#x27;s a pretty good amount inside, and shouldn&#x27;t need more than a couple finger scoops worth. You&#x27;re best off with drying your hair with your towel or dryer, and work the cream all around your hair. I&#x27;ve tried using Crew Pomades, both styling and grooming, but they&#x27;re just far too oily and do not offer enough strength.</li>
            <li> This is  a great product.</li>
            <li> My second purchase of this product and highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I use it everyday for my hair and it usually does well. I love Gatsby and I have many colors.</li>
            <li> I like that I can style my hair perfectly with this and still move and restyle it throughout the day. Superb quality.</li>
            <li> Best styling wax/gel/glue I&#x27;ve ever used, however, I&#x27;ve had my best results when my hair was still damp after towel drying it.  If my hair is too dry, the wax doesn&#x27;t give me as good of a hold.</li>
            <li> Works great and smell great. Can&#x27;t ask for more. Works better than that cheap Axe hair wax stuff. This is the way to go.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for short spiky hair styles, and the scent is amazing. It&#x27;s definitely not just for men even though I rarely see reviews by females and there are no females on the Gatsby site.</li>
            <li> holds well, and i&#x27;ve left the container open a few times for a day, but if i close it, it&#x27;s back to normal, and works again like new :D</li>
            <li> Really like this stuff.  Holds well.  Scent is a little much for me.  Would prefer a more masculine smell.</li>
            <li> This is a great product that keeps your hair design in place no matter what! It is a bit tough to get out during a washing but it comes out. A little dab will do you!</li>
            <li> OK so first thing&#x27;s first, im a white guy with white guy hair, and ive been using Gatsby moving rubber spiky edge every day for a few years now and i absolutely love it! i had tried quite a few other hair styling products before discovering GMR but this is by far the best. im a big fan of anime/manga so i wanted to go for the spiky hair look and this stuff certainly did the trick.</li>
            <li> This thing is sticky.  Maybe all hair wax are sticky, never used one before.  You need to wet your hair or wet your hand when putting the wax on your hair.  It holds up your hair nicely.</li>
            <li> My husband cannot live without this product. He says it&#x27;s so easy to work with, it rinses CLEAN without residue, and it smells good. I sometimes steal a little from him to tame flyaways, and it works great.</li>
            <li> I first found out about this product while I was in Japan.  I ran out of hair products on my business trip and ran down to the local corner store to pick up anything to hold me off until I got back to the States.  I was hesitant at first as there were so many different types that I was overwhelmed.  I randomly picked a few.  Overall I liked them all, but Moving Rubber is my favorite by far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went from a short messy hairdo to the now more popular undercut, and Gatsby Moving Rubber has held both hairstyles the best.  I&#x27;m so glad I&#x27;m able to purchase Gatsby on Amazon!</li>
            <li> These are decent, but it looses its hold throughout the day and restyling will only last a few minutes before the hair falls back down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, being out in direct sunlight, you can actually feel it melt and collapse within minutes. I do have heavier hair so I&#x27;m sure that doesn&#x27;t help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does smell nice, though.</li>
            <li> Pretty much what everyone says about this.... this product is amazing.  It doesnt really leave my hair feeling greasy and almost feels as if there is nothing in my hair and the spikes magically stands up.  Recommend this for anybody, but especially those with straight hair and want a different look other than the uniformed look gel gives you.</li>
            <li> A+ Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Holds very well without looking to shiny.  Best product for my hair!</li>
            <li> It is super sticky. When you try to fix your hair just a little bit after putting it on, it will be painful to do it, which is what I love about this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember to not leave the lid open, though.</li>
            <li> It works. A little bit rough when you first apply it. But holds throughout the day.</li>
            <li> It is as nice as looks on the picture. It works like it should... keeps the hair firm as advertised.</li>
            <li> I have bushy, thick , coarse asian hair. I tried all of the horrible thick gel they sell here in the US and it&lt;br /&gt;works well, but I look like my head is dipped in glue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff. THIS STUFF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AMAZING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dab a dime size on the palm, and smooth into the hair.&lt;br /&gt;Sides, back, top, front. ( in that order)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is amazing now! Looks like no product, and my hair is so calm and behaved you&lt;br /&gt;would think I had straight Japanese hair instead of the Filipino Brillo I was given at birth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. ARE YOU ASIAN WITH CRAZY POOFY BRISTLY HAIR?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUY IT NOW, it will change the game. CHANGE THE GAME.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: Smells like green apple. Girls like it, men are puzzled by it. Meh.</li>
            <li> I am looking for exactly the same product I bring from China&lt;br /&gt;and find this one is available in Amazon&lt;br /&gt;Get it and it is exactly the same as the one from China.&lt;br /&gt;I am really happy and satisfied with it, thank you</li>
            <li> I went to Japan in 2006 for study.  Immediately my Japanese friends told me that the product I was using at the time was garbage.  I was a bit surprised since it was really expensive stuff I had gotten from a salon (which took some pride swallowing to actually buy).  My problem then was that American products with great hold left my hair stiff and flaky, and stuff that was softer left my hair slimy and matted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I borrowed some Spiky Edge from one of my friends there and haven&#x27;t looked back.  When I started sending pics home to my girlfriend, she noticed right away that my hair looked much better.  Needless to say, this paid off in a big way when I got home, wink wink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To quote Ron Swanson \\&quot;I won&#x27;t publicly endorse a product unless I use it exclusively. My only official recommendations are U.S. Army issued mustache trimmers, Morton&#x27;s salt, and the C.R. Lawrence Fein two inch axe-style scraper oscillating knife blade.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well Ron, if you will try Spiky Edge, you&#x27;d have to add one more product to that list.  It&#x27;s better than Snake Juice.</li>
            <li> My favorite!!! And fast shipping!!!</li>
            <li> My cousin had this. It does stick your hair up but it&#x27;s so hard to wash out</li>
            <li> Gatsby Moving Rubber Spiky Edge is my favorite wax to use for my hair. The wax last on my hair all day long. It has somewhat of a shine if you put too much, but a little is good enough to make your hair stick. I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 years and am continuing to buy it when i run out. Also, it smells like apple so it makes your hair smell good!</li>
            <li> On time and no problems.</li>
            <li> 200% recommend! Really good product for those who make their hair style very day!</li>
            <li> this product is amazing&lt;br /&gt;i might buy more for my friends as gift&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;perfect gift item for guys and girls who want to look fabulous ;)</li>
            <li> I usually love Gatsby products and have had this one before, but the one I ordered recently was awful.  Usually I love opening a new container and using it for the first time.  But this time I opened it and was disappointed.  The product is usually like a semi-liquid, but this one is hardened and is like clay.  the product seems to have denatured and doesn&#x27;t work as well as it should.  I am very displeased with this.</li>
            <li> Mandoms Gatsby wax and UNO Wax by Shiseido are the only brands of wax I have used in my life that I truly love and works how I want it too.  I am Caucasian with straight and fairly limp hair.  It is very difficult to deal with and and shape/manipulate and give volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Pink Gatsby \\&quot;Spiky Edge\\&quot; wax has been my favorite wax for awhile (I have tried 4 different Gatsby waxes and the Pink seems to offer the strongest hold and is very versatile).  It is the first wax I came across that reliably held my hair where I wanted it (needed some readjustment throughout the day because it has a pliable hold) and also didn&#x27;t have a grotesque texture or do horrible things to my hair i.e: drying out, or being impossible to wash out or creating white flakes.  So in short, Gatsby Pink for short (mega short) OR longer hair (up to 3\\&quot;)works wonders and is great for hold and flexibility.</li>
            <li> Very great product :) holds my hair up keeps it smelling like green apple and overall a really great product to give you that anime or asian look;)</li>
            <li> it works great! best wax ever I&#x27;ve used~! and super fast shipping. I&#x27;ll definitely buy again! :D</li>
            <li> Much cheaper on Amazon than anywhere else. Provided very good texture for short hair.</li>
            <li> Great hold but it makes me look like I have dandruff. Like right after applying it theres tiny white flakes everywhere for the whole day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Am I using this product incorrectly or something?</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.  I mix a little with the grunge Gatsby wax, seems to be the best combo for me.  I think this is something I get better with the more time I use it.  Sounds strange to say that about a hair product, but it does have a process to using it.  Shipped fast too.</li>
            <li> Great stuff! Hard to get out of hair, but can&#x27;t complain because it does exactly what I need it too.</li>
            <li> WoW Excellent~~ Thank You so much! A++++-+</li>
            <li> Loved it at first but after a few hours It  becomes flaky looking in your hair.  It has a really good hold but I&#x27;ll just stick to my previous hair wax American Crew Fiber.</li>
            <li> This is the best hair product I&#x27;ve used so far! I&#x27;ve used Axe hair wax, Got2b wax, and many more, but nothing compared to this one!!!! I will buy it again!!!!</li>
            <li> For Asian individuals, it&#x27;s really hard to find a hair product that is strong enough to style our hair texture. For some reason, our hair structure is just really think. Gatsby was the solution. For three years, I&#x27;ve been using this amazing wax to style my hair.  I get compliments all the time, and people always ask what I&#x27;m using.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  Most of the reviews and I am assuming purchasers, are men.  I am a woman with a short spiky hair style and this works wonders.  I only need to use a little and it leaves my hair nice and soft, but styled all day.  If you put it on wet hair it will leave it a little crunchy.  I am not sure why so many have said that it hard to remove from the hair, because I haven&#x27;t had one issue with this.  Maybe if you used a lot of product it might be more difficult to remove, but I found it washes right out. The price point is excellent because most of the products that I have used are 2 to 3 times more.  I will be purchasing again!</li>
            <li> This works well for my short/medium thin-ish blonde hair.  I heard this was a great product for asian hair, but it works well in mine as well.  If your hair is 1-3&amp;#34; this will work well either using a lot to get a spiky look or just a little to feather it to the side.</li>
            <li> I have been using this hair wax for over 4 years now, and this thing is great. It is strong enough hold my hair for 8+ hrs and does not make my hair look shiny like some products.</li>
            <li> Yup! I found the one. I&#x27;ve tried 3 of Hanz de Fuko products and none of them hold my hair as well as this stuff! The spiky edge wax is very lightweight so it won&#x27;t weigh your hair down, yet allows you to mold you hair exactly how you want. I mainly use HdF Claymation and while it worked, I had to use quite a bit and then douse it in hairspray to keep my hair locked in place. This stuff doesn&#x27;t require as much product to achieve the same result, but much lighter feeling and locks in place extremely well. It is also very easy to wash off your hands compared to Claymation. Overall, I love this stuff and I recommend it for anyone who have very fine hair but grows in really thick. My hair is about 5-6 inches long up top and I can style it perfectly with this stuff!</li>
            <li> I bought this stuff while living in Japan. It is by far hands down the best hair styling product I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Awesome Hold, smells like a fruit bowl.</li>
            <li> Really, really, really strong all-day hold! Does not flake unless you put too much on.&lt;br /&gt;I usually wash my hair out with a cheaper shampoo first, then wash it again with better shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> Such great Quality...!&lt;br /&gt;Very impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only concern is that this product get dried too fast and very stiff.&lt;br /&gt;I tried Purple and it is too soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope they had something in between.</li>
            <li> Incredible, smells great, has great hold and you can just use the product in your hair already to stand your hair back up if it falls. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> This Wax is truly amazing! It has super hold for people with very thick hair like myself and it does not leave the hair shiny!</li>
            <li> it smells so good&lt;br /&gt;And it holds really  really well.&lt;br /&gt;I use it for my hair and my cosplay wigs&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s amazing!&lt;br /&gt;When you open it it smells so good and looks like lotion until you put it on your hands and than it because sticky&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s wonderful!</li>
            <li> This product has a good texture which makes it easy for me to shape my hair.</li>
            <li> This product holds really well for Asian hair, but my scalp would feel a little bit itchy after I apply this. Would look forward to other product that does not have this problem.</li>
            <li> Does the job perfectly. As far as i know. It&#x27;s the best hair style wax there is.</li>
            <li> I love this wax, it works great on my hair.</li>
            <li> i have a fo-hawk and i love this stuff. This allows my hair to stay in form and shape all day without being rock solid. Only issue is taht on hot days i do tend to notice it being a little more oily. Overall this is great ( this particular one has lasted over a month) this has become my replacement for Crew fiber.</li>
            <li> This is all I use anymore for my hair.  Takes very little and doesn&#x27;t flake or turn to grease.  Don&#x27;t over-apply or it will feel heavy and oily.</li>
            <li> This product was made for Asian hair (very straight hair). It&#x27;s a great hold without it making it feel like glue. NO SHINY LOOK. I hate when hair product makes my head shiny. It&#x27;s a natural look. Only small complaint is the smell. It&#x27;s not the best smelly hair product but it&#x27;s ok.</li>
