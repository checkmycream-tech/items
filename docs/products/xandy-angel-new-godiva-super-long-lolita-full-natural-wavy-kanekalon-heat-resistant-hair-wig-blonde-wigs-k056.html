            <li>♥</li>
            <li>Awesome length and good quality.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is definitely a great wig for cosplay.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love!!</li>
            <li>This product is simply amazing!</li>
            <li>Looks so good,  even to wear out.</li>
            <li>I have a couple of comments about this purchase, good and fair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not quite the color in the picture as you can tell, but over all it&#x27;s sorta a good wig.</li>
            <li>beautiful wig...feels real and looks great!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so In love with this beautiful wig.  </li>
            <li>I am 5&#x27;6 and the wig ends passed my belly button, so I am very pleased eith length.</li>
            <li>This is the best wig ive ever purchased, people think its my real hair, and its super adorable!!!</li>
            <li>I love this wig!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied with this purchase and will be returning to X&amp;Y ANGEL to buy more &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll admit the wig is much thinner than I imagined, but it&#x27;s very fair for the price it is.</li>
            <li>And when it came in it was really curly and beautiful and....</li>
            <li>but otherwise love it</li>
            <li>I love the softness and realness of it.  </li>
            <li>so the fibres are an okay quality.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had better</li>
            <li>Adorable curls and length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The wig ended up being a bit darker than I had wanted, but that could easily be a mistake on my part and my computer.</li>
            <li>and I could easily comb them out.</li>
            <li>so I was expecting another disappointment but very happy to this wig in great condition.  </li>
            <li>cheap cheap wig.</li>
            <li>Once I opened the package and saw the wig, it was like love at first sight.</li>
            <li>nothing significant to freak out about now or in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:</li>
            <li>Good quality for the price and the color on this was platinum blonde, not quite as gold toned as the picture.</li>
            <li>As for the quality, it&#x27;s fair for the price it is, probably can get just enough wears out of it.</li>
            <li>I brushed it a good 15 minutes and it still seem to keep tangling and it lost some hair.</li>
            <li>The wig has perfect long curls, the color was exact, quality was outstanding, very soft, and it fits snugly on my rather large head which is a huge plus.</li>
            <li>It is very long and beautiful and the color is just as pictured but it tangles very easily, that&#x27;s the only issue I found with it.</li>
            <li>This wig came in the mail yesterday when the expected date for it was about early February which was surprising, and the packaging was nice.</li>
            <li>Its a beautiful, comfortable wig nonetheless, but is an absolute mess when it comes to styling.</li>
            <li>, it arrived in half of the time it said it would, which was great.</li>
            <li>I got my wig about five days earlier than the estimated delivery date, so that&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li>wasn&#x27;t even the right wig.</li>
            <li>Just needs a gentle brush-out after each use!</li>
            <li>It is exactly what I was looking for for my upcoming cosplay.</li>
            <li>So, even though I love this wig enough to give it five stars, here are some pros and cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so it looks pretty realistic.</li>
            <li>But after waiting a whole month for this wig, I was determined to style it.</li>
            <li>Everything from the curliness to the thickness is so much better than I expected.  </li>
            <li>Really, before anything, I always read reviews and decide on a purchase by summarizing the pros and cons reported in them.</li>
            <li>cute for a costume but not good enough for wearing out unless with a had or hair band or something to make the fit more natural.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super long, and super soft!</li>
            <li>Not as thick as I was hoping, but it is very smooth!</li>
            <li>I ordered this with a WHOLE bunch of other things, and it came in last, but I wasn&#x27;t in any kind of rush.</li>
            <li>I love it so much, and it even came much earlier than expected!</li>
            <li>Color is great but the picture is false advertising the wig wasn&#x27;t as long as said</li>
            <li>So far there&#x27;s no cons I can say about this wig.</li>
            <li>Of course, the shine can be fixed using baby powder, but the netting is clearly visible no matter how I style the wig.</li>
            <li>It fits amazingly, it&#x27;s not itchy, and I love it.</li>
            <li>The bangs were pretty long!</li>
            <li>Once you brush it with a wig brush, the hair falls out quickly and looks fluffy.</li>
            <li>I an 5&#x27;10&amp;#34; and it just barely touches my butt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li>The ends of the wig were super tangled but the wig over all was relatively soft but when it came to put it on, I was drowning in hair and my gosh was it hard to bush.</li>
            <li>This wig is an absolute mess when it comes to styling.</li>

            <li> I waited a month for such crappy material, I waited a month for blonde yarn.</li>
            <li> Bangs way to long</li>
            <li> That was the only thing I was not aware of as no one took a pic from the front.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It only took a few brushes before the ends started to fray and become a complete mess.</li>
            <li> Quite closer to ash blonde, not golden.</li>
            <li> Very thin and can see right through wig!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend it at all, unless you like wearing yarn.</li>
            <li> I received it in the mail way before its expected arrival time and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  </li>
            <li> but there was absolutely no warmth to this.</li>
            <li> A few strands fell out, but that&#x27;s bound to happen with any wig when you open it no matter</li>
            <li> I have yet to successfully comb through the nasty tangles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought several wigs before on Amazon, and even from this seller, but for once I am not pleased at all.</li>
            <li> I think I may have been sent the entirely wrong one but also didn&#x27;t feel as if it was worth the few dollars to dye it, to go through the process of returns.</li>
            <li> This wig is not very full at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s disappointingly bland in color, but it&#x27;s also EXTREMELY shiny.</li>
            <li> im adding dark roots to mine and dying it teal</li>
            <li> but when I opened it the wig was half of out it.</li>
            <li> At first, I thought it was too small, but then I found the adjusting pieces and figured out that I am definitely a numb to the wig universe.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only up side is the price, but this has even worse quality than buying a Halloween wig.</li>
            <li> I wish I could get a refund because this was a waste of money!</li>
            <li> Nothing like picture, buy directly from X&amp;Y Angel like says above the other companies send u crap!</li>
            <li> I will warn, the back is very thin, so</li>
            <li> the wig is a little thin</li>
            <li> This should be common sense.</li>
            <li> By styling, I mean braiding it.</li>
            <li> Before the wig was even on, the hair was tangled and as I used my wig brush on it, it started shedding even worse than before.</li>
            <li> defiantly looks fake.</li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> You really can&#x27;t go wrong with buying this.  </li>
            <li> its so thick you could put it up in twin tails and not have any wefts showing!!!</li>
            <li> totally worthless if you want to not look like you are wearing a wig.</li>
            <li> and I was very disappointed in that.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> cheap cheap wig. defiantly looks fake. the bangs and part look horrid. that is why she has a headband on in the photos. totally worthless if you want to not look like you are wearing a wig. it is a costume wig.</li>
            <li> I wish I had the money to return this hair!! I waited a month for such crappy material, I waited a month for blonde yarn. I wish I could get a refund because this was a waste of money! I don&#x27;t recommend it at all, unless you like wearing yarn. That&#x27;s just how the quality of the hair appears to me.</li>
            <li> the wig is a little thin and it&#x27;s quite a chore to de-tangle but argan oil helps substancially.  I will warn, the back is very thin, so if you have your wig styled in the manner the model photographed is styled, you will see track marks for days in the back.</li>
            <li> Color is great but the picture is false advertising the wig wasn&#x27;t as long as said and I was very disappointed in that.</li>
            <li> Nothing like picture, buy directly from X&amp;Y Angel like says above the other companies send u crap! Very thin and can see right through wig!</li>
            <li> Bangs way to long but otherwise love it</li>
            <li> Not as thick as I was hoping, but it is very smooth! Just needs a gentle brush-out after each use!</li>
            <li> beautiful wig...feels real and looks great!</li>
            <li> I received the wig about a week ago. It took about a month to arrive. The wig ended up being a bit darker than I had wanted, but that could easily be a mistake on my part and my computer. I ordered this for a costume. My costume required me to do some styling. By styling, I mean braiding it. When I opened the package, I found some tangles, which I figured would not be an issue and I could easily comb them out. I was wrong. This wig is an absolute mess when it comes to styling. It only took a few brushes before the ends started to fray and become a complete mess. I started trying to comb the wig through about a week ago. But after waiting a whole month for this wig, I was determined to style it. I have yet to successfully comb through the nasty tangles. Its a beautiful, comfortable wig nonetheless, but is an absolute mess when it comes to styling. If anyone plans to purchase the wig, do not even think about styling or brushing the hair. Total train wreck!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so In love with this beautiful wig.  Shipping box was a bit beat up so I was expecting another disappointment but very happy to this wig in great condition.  I love the softness and realness of it.  Looks so good,  even to wear out.</li>
            <li> Ohhhhh...hunty....this was the best Daisy Duke wig I could come up with.  Awesome length and good quality.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super long, and super soft! And when it came in it was really curly and beautiful and.... unf... I am so happy! I have no issue with the amount of time it came in. I ordered this with a WHOLE bunch of other things, and it came in last, but I wasn&#x27;t in any kind of rush. It fits amazingly, it&#x27;s not itchy, and I love it.♥</li>
            <li> This product is simply amazing! I received it in the mail way before its expected arrival time and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  The quality for the price can&#x27;t be beat. Everything from the curliness to the thickness is so much better than I expected.  You really can&#x27;t go wrong with buying this.  I&#x27;m in love!!</li>
            <li> Once you brush it with a wig brush, the hair falls out quickly and looks fluffy.</li>
            <li> This wig looks gray not blonde</li>
            <li> This wig came in the mail yesterday when the expected date for it was about early February which was surprising, and the packaging was nice. Once I opened the package and saw the wig, it was like love at first sight. The wig has perfect long curls, the color was exact, quality was outstanding, very soft, and it fits snugly on my rather large head which is a huge plus. So far there&#x27;s no cons I can say about this wig. I&#x27;m very satisfied with this purchase and will be returning to X&amp;Y ANGEL to buy more &amp;#60;3 (p.s. I might post up a picture)</li>
            <li> cute for a costume but not good enough for wearing out unless with a had or hair band or something to make the fit more natural. Good quality for the price and the color on this was platinum blonde, not quite as gold toned as the picture.</li>
            <li> It was practically silver/white. I dyed it the correct color but there was absolutely no warmth to this. Two stars because it matches the length and style specified, it also took well to the dye and heat so the fibres are an okay quality. I think I may have been sent the entirely wrong one but also didn&#x27;t feel as if it was worth the few dollars to dye it, to go through the process of returns.</li>
            <li> This is the best wig ive ever purchased, people think its my real hair, and its super adorable!!! I love it so much, and it even came much earlier than expected! Love it</li>
            <li> It is very long and beautiful and the color is just as pictured but it tangles very easily, that&#x27;s the only issue I found with it.</li>
            <li> This wig is not very full at all. The color is off, as everyone&#x27;s been saying. It&#x27;s disappointingly bland in color, but it&#x27;s also EXTREMELY shiny. Of course, the shine can be fixed using baby powder, but the netting is clearly visible no matter how I style the wig. I bought this for a cosplay which needed pigtails, and was hoping that I could mask it in some way, but that wasn&#x27;t going to happen. This wig also sheds quite a bit. Hair had fallen out when I took it out of the package, and as I wore it. Before the wig was even on, the hair was tangled and as I used my wig brush on it, it started shedding even worse than before. I&#x27;ve bought several wigs before on Amazon, and even from this seller, but for once I am not pleased at all. The only up side is the price, but this has even worse quality than buying a Halloween wig.</li>
            <li> its so thick you could put it up in twin tails and not have any wefts showing!!! im adding dark roots to mine and dying it teal</li>
            <li> I have a couple of comments about this purchase, good and fair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One, it arrived in half of the time it said it would, which was great. It was here within about 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another is that when I took it out of the packaging, I didn&#x27;t experience any tangles like some reviews said. I brushed through it starting from the ends and worked my way up. A few strands fell out, but that&#x27;s bound to happen with any wig when you open it no matter quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m using this wig for a cosplay and I&#x27;ll admit the wig is much thinner than I imagined, but it&#x27;s very fair for the price it is. I am 5&#x27;6 and the wig ends passed my belly button, so I am very pleased eith length. As for the quality, it&#x27;s fair for the price it is, probably can get just enough wears out of it.</li>
            <li> I bought this wig around valentines day and it just got to me today, it came in a bag but when I opened it the wig was half of out it. The ends of the wig were super tangled but the wig over all was relatively soft but when it came to put it on, I was drowning in hair and my gosh was it hard to bush. I brushed it a good 15 minutes and it still seem to keep tangling and it lost some hair. It&#x27;s not quite the color in the picture as you can tell, but over all it&#x27;s sorta a good wig. I&#x27;ve had better but this is still manageable. Doesn&#x27;t have a shine to it so it looks pretty realistic.</li>
            <li> I got my wig about five days earlier than the estimated delivery date, so that&#x27;s nice. Really, before anything, I always read reviews and decide on a purchase by summarizing the pros and cons reported in them. I love this wig! It is exactly what I was looking for for my upcoming cosplay. So, even though I love this wig enough to give it five stars, here are some pros and cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. Adjustable. At first, I thought it was too small, but then I found the adjusting pieces and figured out that I am definitely a numb to the wig universe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Adorable curls and length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Hair net included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Brushed it with no problems. Just like my regular hair, some strands came out but nothing significant to freak out about now or in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: (This only applies as a contrast to the pic. This does not reflect my views on the wig but rather if I think of it outside of my preferences)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Not the color depicted. Quite closer to ash blonde, not golden. I was aware of this due to other reviews and bought it for that reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. If you&#x27;re tall, this will be short on you. This should be common sense. I an 5&#x27;10&amp;#34; and it just barely touches my butt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. The bangs were pretty long! I had to cut them an inch shorter to get them the way they are in the pic. Please keep that in mind. That was the only thing I was not aware of as no one took a pic from the front.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely a great wig for cosplay. I will be recommending it to my friends.</li>
