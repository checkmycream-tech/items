            <li>I think it is the best product of this type out there.</li>

            <li>The shape of the head is not the greatest for some curvatures under the chin</li>
            <li>Works great!</li>

            <li>I don&#x27;t know how it would work for body grooming but with the kind of power it has, I doubt it will be good and also broadness of the blade might be an issue.</li>

            <li>It can handle very light trimming fairly well, but anything beyond that</li>
            <li>Still isn&#x27;t extremely powerful, but it is very good for the price.</li>
            <li>Bought this trimmer to use primarily as a beard trimmer and it works great.</li>
            <li>I see is it doesn&#x27;t work as well with body hair as others I&#x27;ve had, but does a great job for its primary purpose</li>
            <li>Works amazing...</li>
            <li>The difference is truly amazing.</li>
            <li>This product does a great and comfortable job doing that.</li>
            <li>The fact that it is waterproof and can be run under the faucet for cleaning is another amazing perk.&lt;br</li>

            <li>Nice product.</li>
            <li>so Dad could have his own.</li>
            <li>Rather than wasting 20 bucks and waiting in line for an hour twice a month at a barbershop, I decided to try doing my own buzzes.  </li>
            <li>Nice beard trimmer.</li>
            <li>I liked it</li>
            <li>That means no car charging... which is nice to have that option.</li>
            <li>Excellent beard trimmer and very reliable.  </li>
            <li>Adjustable trim length is nice.  </li>
            <li>and I bought one for my husband because he liked it so well.  </li>
            <li>Nice shave and a multitude of length options.</li>
            <li>Turned the dial to the longest adjustment and found a nice bit of hair.</li>
            <li>Handy stand,</li>
            <li>It struggles to effectively trim the hair below my nose on my mustache.  </li>
            <li>My husband liked it.</li>
            <li>nice</li>
            <li>Update 11/2016 - While it worked, I liked this trimmer.  </li>
            <li>It is a nice produce.</li>
            <li>Also comes with a nice charging stand.</li>
            <li>This does a nice job keeping it trim.  </li>
            <li>so I need something that can work quickly, effectively and efficiently.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;He said that he liked it based on the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The product is nice and neat.  </li>
            <li>Nice rubberized grip won&#x27;t slip.</li>
            <li>Fits nice to the head......</li>
            <li>I used to have an old body trimmer which I considered it was good after years of usage, but after using this one you feel the difference, and the best of all is that this device is quieter.</li>
            <li>Nice product, I like the wet/dry ability.</li>
            <li>If you intend to use this in the shower, your warm water will run out before you finish and the trimming will be spotty.</li>
            <li>excellent incremental adjustments and easy to clean</li>
            <li>Really nice length adjustment.</li>
            <li>According to Men&#x27;s Health this is the best trimmer in the market and really is.&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li>but all in all is a nice product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does have a couple of nice features.</li>
            <li>The charger is nice and the clipper is well designed.</li>
            <li>excellent trimmer, works very well,</li>
            <li>I have used it both on my hair and my beard and it dose a nice job on both.</li>
            <li>It is nice that it is an all-in-one unit.</li>
            <li>Just my own preference.  </li>
            <li>Liked the shape and adjustability.</li>
            <li>I really just wanted a single-piece adjustable trimmer, and this has been the best one in this price range</li>
            <li>Nice product for beard trimming.  </li>
            <li>Cuts nicely.  </li>
            <li>Does everything it promised, effectively.  </li>
            <li>The features are nice.</li>
            <li>Cuts whiskers effectively.</li>
            <li>Unusually nice recharging recharging stand and height adjustment dial.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First I&#x27;ll start with the good: I love that it is cordless and has an integrated adjustable head.</li>
            <li>It cuts nice and even, no pulling of hairs.</li>
            <li>--they performed their job effectively, however--</li>
            <li>Cordless and a nice price.</li>
            <li>This is one nice tool.</li>
            <li>, nice charger set up</li>
            <li>but an all around nice product.</li>
            <li>Nice charger.</li>
            <li>The product is really nice.</li>
            <li>It is nice that the blades snap out for cleaning and oiling.</li>
            <li>All in all I am very happy with the trimmer and would highly recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li>My husband liked some features and not others.  </li>
            <li>The Comb is twist adjustable in mm measurements, which is handy</li>
            <li>And the price is more than fair.</li>
            <li>Really nice unit.&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li>My husband liked it from the word go.</li>
            <li>also would have liked the motor to be just a bit stronger and/or</li>
            <li>Nice wet/dry use feature.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t speak to how effective it is at shaving.</li>
            <li>Honestly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy, but my wife still wants me to shave ALL of my beard off.  </li>
            <li>The portability and shower use are nice.  </li>
            <li>Nice too that the shaver is waterproof.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice trimmer for the beard.</li>
            <li>tried it yet, in the shower, but a nice option indeed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gave</li>
            <li>Not the cheapest one, but the best one.&lt;br /&gt;The 19 position adjustable ring is precise and smooth.  </li>
            <li>The attachment is great, the trimmer is easy to clean and feels very nice.</li>
            <li>Works great and trims really cleanly.  </li>
            <li>so happy i choose this one, he loves being clean shaven.</li>

            <li>Very easy to use on my head to keep my hair trim (think peach fuzz), and keeping my goatee looking nice.  </li>
            <li>Wonderful product that I highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>, i got it for mostly body hair, so great for shure, lots of adjustment in the head, easy to use</li>
            <li>When I had just my goatee, I used some scissors to keep it trimmed, but now that I decided to grow a full beard, I needed something to help me not look all duck dynasty, LOL.  </li>
            <li>Very good precision blades, and easy to clean and maintain.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m super happy with the performance of this trimmer.</li>
            <li>I really thought this one was going to be great, and it&#x27;s barely good.</li>
            <li>You have to go over an area more than once to make sure you get good coverage.  </li>
            <li>Is a good item my husband love it he used it all the time my husband  love.</li>
            <li>Good power and easily adjustable.  </li>
            <li>and the length options are great without having to switch out clips, but if it can&#x27;t cut through the hair, none of the good stuff really matters.</li>
            <li>The ease of use with the quick length adjustment is great when going from trimming my eyebrows to 5 oclock shadow to chest hair.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use..</li>
            <li>Cleans very easily, the lowest setting is just a shade longer than what I would call stubble, and holds up under water without malfunctioning.</li>

            <li>So far this is the best trimmer I have purchased.  </li>
            <li>I bought this to repalce a 10 year old Norelco trimmer and it is truly awesome.</li>
            <li>and this one is the best so far....</li>
            <li>I gave this a try and feel is the best so far.</li>

            <li>Best beard trimmer I have ever owned, by far.</li>
            <li>found any cons so far and the best trimmer I have used up to date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far, though, I have been impressed with this Panasonic trimmer.  </li>
            <li>Nice settings easy to clean and great battery life.</li>
            <li>However, I didn&#x27;t own this thing for more than a couple weeks and the plastic height adjustment piece broke.</li>

            <li>Very easy to use, easy to clean, cuts great.  </li>

            <li>The length adjustment is great, and the head pulls off easily for close shave and to clean.  </li>
            <li>Let me say that I currently own a Panasonic plasma TV and have enjoyed many Panasonic products over the years.</li>
            <li>Overall this is a great upgrade and a great product.</li>
            <li>This offers the best value (performance/cost) of all the many models I have used over the years.</li>
            <li>Works great for trimming my facial hair, great deal in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, works great in the shower, easy to clean and oil.</li>
            <li>Works great and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s OK at best, but feel a plug in is more accurate and consistent for thicker beards.</li>

            <li>and he&#x27;s been pretty happy with it.</li>

            <li>Love the fact that you can use it in the shower.  </li>
            <li>After many others these trimmers are the bomb .</li>
            <li>Love this razor.</li>
            <li>Better than panasonic&#x27;s cheaper black-silver thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this trimmer.  </li>
            <li>Best of all, it&#x27;s quiet and doesn&#x27;t remind you of the Dentist drilling away.</li>
            <li>Love this shaver.  </li>
            <li>Great quality and I really like the fact there are no attachments.  </li>
            <li>Glad I found this one.</li>
            <li>Love the dial, you don&#x27;t need a bunch of attachments.</li>
            <li>It was actually better than I thought based on the performance.</li>
            <li>100x better than the wahl lithium I have been using.</li>
            <li>More than met all of my expectations and I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>Have used several body trimmers over the years but this one is the best of the bunch.</li>
            <li>This item didnt disappoint me. :)</li>
            <li>MANY MANY PASSES to cut all the hair.  </li>
            <li>and it is definitely the best one I have ever owned.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I read the reviews on many trimmers.</li>
            <li>I am pleased</li>
            <li>You have the sales and cancelation history, so if you choose to look into it, okay,</li>
            <li>and shower &#x3D; lovely</li>
            <li>love it kids use it to trim there hair also</li>
            <li>I use it to trim sides and top of</li>
            <li>Outstanding device.</li>
            <li>I like being able to rinse it under the faucet.  </li>
            <li>great trimmer very well made&lt;br /&gt;versatile</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Like most Panasonic products it came with a range of care goods.</li>
            <li>ok this thing i love.</li>
            <li>, i have been using this thing and only this for 6 months now and it works perfectly</li>
            <li>Phillips, which is still able to cut better then this thing.  </li>
            <li>This trimmer is excellent for not only your face, but manscaping as well!  </li>
            <li>So glad I bought this.</li>
            <li>Great item, fast shipping thank you</li>
            <li>if you have questions on specifics shoot me a email... top notch</li>
            <li>Love that it is waterproof.</li>
            <li>Since I used it about once a week, it&#x27;s more work than I want in a beard trimmer.  </li>
            <li>Love that it has a dock.  </li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>Many settings for beard and hair length.</li>
            <li>I give it a 4 star just because the trimmer takes a bit more time in getting my beard trimmed ( but that might me just me though ).&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied</li>
            <li>Not only is it the best</li>
            <li>Except for oiling l&#x27;m enjoying the performance of the razor.</li>
            <li>Glad I got it.</li>
            <li>My favorite shaver yet.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>After reading many reviews I decided to purchase the Panasonic Milano Series ER-GB40-S Hair &amp; Body Trimmer</li>
            <li>What he loves mostly, he can use it in the shower.</li>
            <li>This trimmer is top notch.  </li>
            <li>I love Panasonic products</li>
            <li>Manscapers will love this one.</li>
            <li>at the same time to pick the best one, but wound up returning that as well.  </li>
            <li>Overall the best body trimmer I have found.</li>
            <li>but it seems to be better than all of the ones that I have tried before.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned many brands.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>Powerful and stays charged a good while.  </li>
            <li>But this one is better and it&#x27;s water proof.</li>
            <li>and that makes it just okay.</li>
            <li>It is a better beard trimmer than a mustache trimmer.  </li>
            <li>Love this...  take it in the shower, or shave at sink.  </li>
            <li>It has not succeeded in convincing my wife that uniform longer is okay, but winning arguments wasn&#x27;t advertised as a feature.</li>
            <li>It looks more like 10 days of growth.</li>
            <li>This product is definitely more geared for face and head, not body.</li>
            <li>I love the adjustable dial and not having to switch guards in and out.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is safe, no chance to cut your skin even if you are in a rush to trim your beard or genital hair</li>
            <li>Short of its longer than some blade it is an awesome tool to keep my beard in check.</li>
            <li>just make sure you keep oiling the blades as required by the owners manual.</li>
            <li>it is I always feel it needs to have more power.</li>
            <li>price watched before purchasing because it cost more than I wanted to spend.</li>
            <li>There might be something better or there, but you won&#x27;t regret this if ease of cleaning is a priority.</li>
            <li>I really love these.</li>
            <li>Much better then</li>
            <li>We just need more time to determine how it will hold up.</li>
            <li>The trimmer works ok.  </li>
            <li>I love it, and it hold a charge well.</li>
            <li>So glad I got it.  </li>
            <li>This is now one of my favorite possessions.</li>
            <li>The best male groomer on the market for sure.</li>
            <li>I have had it for more than year now.</li>
            <li>Love it...</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this trimmer.  </li>
            <li>I love that you can just dial a length and not have to change attachments and that it is cordless.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok but needs more power</li>
            <li>Ordered 4 for all the men in my life and they all love it.</li>
            <li>like i have because of the many length steps that can be configured.</li>
            <li>Love the incremental adjustments.</li>
            <li>BUT overall looks like a perfect answer for my needs and a highest quality product...</li>
            <li>Best facial product I have ever invested in!</li>
            <li>Works ok.</li>
            <li>They did a great job with this product.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was fast</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more like 3 day stubble.</li>
            <li>I can go 10 or more trims without charging it.</li>
            <li>It does ok as a body trimmer.</li>
            <li>This trimmer is okay</li>
            <li>and I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li>I believe that he was well pleased with the trimmer.</li>
            <li>Love it.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>any rate, it was the smoothest, most painless trim I have ever had.  </li>
            <li>Much better than the cheaper Norelco he&#x27;s been using.  </li>
            <li>Its ok.</li>
            <li>More on that</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t have made a better purchase.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>love the stand --except for one detail-- as it allows for one-handed stowage and removal.  </li>
            <li>I use it to trim neck hair mostly.</li>
            <li>Love the Panasonic wet/dry shavers.</li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t find a better one at this price.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>love the rechargable aspect.</li>
            <li>Had a $15 Whal that was better.</li>
            <li>I wish it had more power to cut through my beard faster.</li>
            <li>Love that all you have to do is turn to increase or decrease the height.</li>
            <li>Most people think of Remington when they think of electric shavers and trimmers, but I have to say this Panasonic was quite pleasing!&lt;br</li>
            <li>The trimmer is quieter than many I&#x27;ve used, but still makes quite a bit of noise.</li>
            <li>CUT ANY BETTER THAT</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and looks good too sitting on the sink.</li>
            <li>, may have a lot more power then this.  </li>
            <li>This shouldn&#x27;t be price more then Philips 4050 at $49.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has some nice benefits, but also some huge negatives.  </li>
            <li>However, I do have a problem with the comb on top of the trimmer.  </li>
            <li>and it hasn&#x27;t got any better.</li>
            <li>As beard and sideburn trimmers they are outstanding.  </li>
            <li>&quot; so we were thinking that he would be able to trim his head with this.</li>
            <li>I love that it is able to be used in the shower.</li>
            <li>Glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>When the battery starts to age, I won&#x27;t be able to stretch the use of the device by using it while it is plugged in.</li>
            <li>, hopefully it holds up, love the adjustment setting without having to change the spacer.</li>
            <li>Love the size setting dial.</li>
            <li>Still much better than a Remington it  </li>
            <li>I love the rotating selection wheel.</li>
            <li>The adjustable length works great and is very convenient.</li>
            <li>dial to adjust the height of the shaving guard is leagues better than that on the ER224S.  </li>
            <li>Outside of that the trimmer works great!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even use the unit more than 2 times a week.</li>
            <li>It is better than the cheapie I used to have.</li>
            <li>Better than the clip on attachments.</li>
            <li>It does not work better around the chin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Charging: The stand is much better than most trimmers I have owned to date.</li>
            <li>Much better length control.</li>
            <li>I just got this today and just used it, stop searching and wasting your time, this is the trimmer, my beard hair grows every different way and it cut everything evenly and perfectly.  </li>
            <li>Love mine.</li>
            <li>Also love that it is waterproof and has the adjustable trim guard built in.</li>
            <li>It takes a bit longer with these because I have to go over my head more than usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After several months still work perfectly, I will buy again.</li>
            <li>I bought a Wahl about 3 months ago and it cut sort of ok for a while</li>
            <li>I love this thing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s also shaped sort of neutrally; many times I&#x27;d find I was trying to use it backwards because of its ergonomics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The map pointing to where you are to oil the razor isn&#x27;t perfectly diagrammed but you get the idea upon further examination.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it seems like I shouldn&#x27;t have so many problematic hairs.  </li>
            <li>Y&#x27;all are gonna love this product in every way.....</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love the ability and way this trimmer adjusts.</li>
            <li>Love the comb</li>
            <li>Love the wet/dry capability.  </li>
            <li>but what I will say so much better razors out there.</li>
            <li>I love it, it might not be the cheapest</li>
            <li>I really love this product.</li>
            <li>then you will have trimming everywhere, which is why I love Philips Norelco&#x27;s trimmer.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li>(did not yank the hairs) and I was able to rinse it off in the sink.  </li>
            <li>This a well made product that I thought I would get more use out of, but the cons outweigh the pros for me and my family.</li>
            <li>Even so, I&#x27;ve never found a trimmer that I was truly satisfied with...</li>
            <li>Changing the lengths is super easy, it cuts great, easy cleaning.</li>
            <li>Originally gifted this to my husband in 2013 after his Philips Norelco T980 died (it couldn&#x27;t hold a charge after about two years).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned many beard trimmers over the years.</li>
            <li>product I ended up getting which could do everything this Panasonic could do and more, was the Philips Norelco QG3364/42 Multigroom Beard Trimmer.  </li>
            <li>Battery life is great, charges fast, no complaints whatsoever.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m over it :)</li>
            <li>satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>The trimmer is light which is good for convenience but to the point of being so lightweight that it felt cheap and plastic.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Rechargeable&lt;br /&gt;Lithium-Ion Battery lasts many uses before recharging&lt;br</li>
            <li>The top pops off to provide a precision trimmer for closer cuts.</li>
            <li>I also love that I can rinse it off under running water.</li>
            <li>and I am extremely satisfied with the results.  </li>
            <li>It would be OK if you want to keep a stubble look.</li>
            <li>I am quite pleased with this item.</li>
            <li>I love this razor.</li>
            <li>more like fumbling around to get it seated correctly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Would be better if had some indicator as to charge level.</li>
            <li>One would think more companies would capitalize on this, but of course not.</li>
            <li>Which takes more time.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really work that great for me...</li>
            <li>okay...  </li>
            <li>I think they&#x27;d be better off with a more rounded head to help with this.  </li>
            <li>It even looks better.  </li>
            <li>I was additionally pleased as an email from Amazon Prime</li>
            <li>In use, the Panasonic&#x27;s adjustments seem to be more for show than use.</li>
            <li>Perhaps it works better as a hair trimmer  </li>
            <li>- it sure looks like many people like it.</li>
            <li>The directions say it&#x27;s okay to keep it on the charger.</li>
            <li>Love this shaver.</li>
            <li>Already owned one when I picked up this Panasonic, but wasn&#x27;t terribly satisfied with what I was using and thought maybe an upgrade would be worthwhile.</li>
            <li>All in all, really pleased.</li>
            <li>Works ok.</li>
            <li>Hoping in time they will have one with more</li>
            <li>I have been impressed with this trimmer and will buy another when this one finally wears out.</li>
            <li>Have really enjoyed this.  </li>
            <li>thing that I can think to make it better would be ION battery.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent product, I totally recommend this beard trimmer, for the price I paid</li>
            <li>I downgraded it one star because it could use better instructions.</li>
            <li>So many I lose count.  </li>
            <li>pleased with this trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;**Am now using the Panasonic ER-BG60-K (Oct 2015) - which is even better than the ER-BG40.</li>
            <li>He was able to trim it up and will be able to maintain the length he prefers.</li>
            <li>Love it, bought one for my son &amp; he loves it.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how many of these thing I have had over the years.</li>
            <li>With the Panasonic Milano ER-GB40-S, it takes two passes at the most.  </li>
            <li>You just have to make sure you go against the grain</li>
            <li>Perhaps I should wonder that more often.  </li>
            <li>This clipper is just okay.  </li>
            <li>but if it had a vacuum that collected the hairs as you trimmed them it would be the best trimmer!</li>
            <li>It is, however, handy to be able to use running water to clean the trimmer.</li>
            <li>Nice design; like the charging cradle; seem well built; but just not as good as some of my older trimmers</li>
            <li>So far, so good!  </li>
            <li>Works great so far, pretty happy with it.</li>
            <li>my  new #1! and  great value as well</li>
            <li>In a time when more and more trimmers are becoming Maintenance-free, this trimmer requires you to oil</li>
            <li>Great product, replaced older Norelco.  </li>
            <li>to clean, just run warm water over it.</li>
            <li>Its been extremely handy having a trimmer that can be washed with water to clean.</li>
            <li>its always nice and clean.</li>
            <li>But the easy use and the way to cut on different  lengths they are awesome.</li>
            <li>Relatively quiet, easily adjusted, works perfectly.  </li>
            <li>Being able to quick rinse is nice as well&lt;</li>
            <li>Very cool feature for sure.</li>
            <li>Cuts very precisely and easy to care for.</li>
            <li>As a &amp;#34;foliclely challenged&amp;#34; male, it just makes more sense to trim my own hair and beard extra-short, and this trimmer works great.  </li>
            <li>This did a really good job when I first got it.</li>
            <li>pretty good.  </li>
            <li>First, I do not feel the quality of the trim is good when removing the guard and using it to do detail cleanup along the edge of my beard.  </li>
            <li>ts and charges and lasts long to trim everything and is the best razo arpund that works</li>
            <li>This works pretty good</li>
            <li>The adjustable head works pretty good.</li>
            <li>maybe once or twice but not bad, and honestly,.</li>
            <li>The battery started getting weaker and shaver isn&#x27;t as good as when i first got it...</li>
            <li>in all, this has been the best trimmer I have had in a long time.</li>
            <li>The Close shave doesn&#x27;t do a good job and the trimmers don&#x27;t give you a consistent length.&lt;br</li>
            <li>And the blade is cheap and easily replaceable!&lt;br /&gt;Thankyou Panasonic!</li>
            <li>I had to return this, not at all worth the money!!</li>
            <li>The one cordless shaver he had broke and he spend a great deal of time trying to find a new one.</li>
            <li>Great trimmer, light and very quite.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, not as strong of a motor as I would like.</li>
            <li>Best to use dry.</li>
            <li>I just let the shower run over it to get the hair clippings off of it, but it also has a water hole for letting water push through it and force hair out of the clipping end which is super nice for when it gets clogged.  </li>
            <li>I Love the easy to adjust height control.</li>
            <li>I also love that it&#x27;s water proof and can be rinsed out easily from beard trimmings.&lt;br</li>
            <li>You can quickly dial-in what you want which is nice.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure I could easily go 2 weeks without a problem... maybe longer.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and stores nicely.</li>
            <li>trims very well and very good control on the length (prevent from making holes if not at the right angle)</li>

            <li>it is very light and fits comfortably in your hand.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very precise and smooth to use.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Otherwise, this is pretty good all around; you&#x27;ll probably be just fine at the price point.</li>
            <li>This timmer is very easy to use and adjust, also easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>Other wise very nice adjustment feature.</li>
            <li>I am kind of a Panasonic fan boy - I have many of their products (plasma TV, audio equipment, kitchen appliances) and generally, they are all at the very top of their categories.</li>
            <li>I have had these for about a week, and so far, they work great.  </li>
            <li>This trimmer is way better than the cheap one I used for years.</li>
            <li>Glad I didn&#x27;t go for the cheap trimmer again.</li>
            <li>I like the charging station and the many adjustments available.  </li>
            <li>So far works great</li>
            <li>I decided on this shaver based on the reviews and it has work great so far.</li>
            <li>I also am pleased with the LED light that shows that the shaver is being charged ...</li>
            <li>Very durable and feels good in the hand.</li>
            <li>This is a real shame, because it&#x27;s an otherwise good product: wet/dry, rinsable, guide works well when working.</li>
            <li>thanks for good quality</li>
            <li>Works very well and has a good battery life</li>
            <li>He said the attachments make it very versatile, and it is a good quality trimmer.</li>
            <li>This thing is worth every penny,  the adjustment dial is really nice,  </li>
            <li>a good job on my very curly beard.&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li>Easy to use although I have to remind myself which way to use hold it to make sure I trim accurately.  </li>
            <li>I love the numbered dial, it gives me easy and accurate repeatability as I do the sides of my beard shorter than my chin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quite a bit smaller and sleeker than what I&#x27;m used to, but am so impressed with HOW it works, you get over that quickly.  </li>
            <li>Works great, solid product, nice clean cut.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m not sure the wet/dry feature of this shaver is very meaningful; those are best for a clean shave and easy cleanup.  </li>
            <li>Very nice upgrade from 10 yr old Wahl I was using.</li>
            <li>He has a full beard and uses it for that and also his chest!</li>

            <li>Easy to use, easy to clean, easy to love.</li>
            <li>Trims great, makes you want to grow more facial hair.</li>
            <li>This shaver is ok, the shaver doesn&#x27;t give a smooth shave so another one might need to be used to smooth shave.</li>
            <li>and I believe the attached comb prongs will not so easily brake as what happened with my Phillips trimmer.  </li>
            <li>It also has an easy to use adjustment wheel with changes every .5 mm.  </li>
            <li>They have all been quality products and I am very loyal to them.</li>

            <li>Cleaning is easy with the included brush.</li>

            <li>It misses a lot of hairs but charges well and is incredibly easy to use.</li>

            <li>And, it&#x27;s wet-dry, ergonomic, cleans easy, and can even (somewhat) trim the hair on your head.</li>
            <li>Well made, easily adjustable and does not &amp;#34;catch&amp;#34; my face, even in a close trim, which I use often.</li>
            <li>In that regard, the Panasonic easily beats the Remington.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More</li>
            <li>But for a precise and reliable trim, with a battery that won&#x27;t die unexpectedly, this has been a great trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The blade is narrow, and the settings are great for a beard, not so good for stubble.</li>
            <li>The amazon return experience was easy though.</li>

            <li>Motor didn&#x27;t seem too strong.</li>
            <li>I use it mainly as a beard trimmer and it does a fairly good job.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still going strong and hasn&#x27;t lost its charge during periods of non use.</li>
            <li>The better application for the waterproof attribute is that you can just rinse the whole thing off after you use it which is nice because hair sticks to it, esp.</li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S OK, NOTHING SPECIAL.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean, adjust and cuts very cleanly.</li>
            <li>Pretty amazing quality of battery.  </li>

            <li>The comb can easily be removed to allow for the blades to be cleaned or to allow for fine trimming,</li>
            <li>First, its shortest setting will not give a beard or mustache that three day growth look which is currently popular.</li>
            <li>15 hour full charge doesn&#x27;t bother me because I&#x27;ve never had occasion to use it more than once a day.  </li>
            <li>The guard is pretty handy, even though I wish it had adjustments for longer hair.</li>
            <li>Beard is coming along nicely ;)</li>
            <li>It would have been pretty easy &amp; cheap to include some kind of indicator on it, but Panasonic must have figured it would be even easier &amp; cheaper not to...</li>
            <li>He said it was easy to use, very comfortable and super easy to clean.</li>
            <li>The guard is easy to adjust, stays put, and seems accurate.  </li>
            <li>Works fine in or out of shower.</li>
            <li>I got it with black friday discount and its the best beard trimmer I have ever seen .</li>
            <li>A fine waterproof unit for all of your trimming needs.</li>
            <li>Adjustable head allows any length you want and runs smooth and cleans easily</li>
            <li>I then just throw it up a half MM to blend it in with the sideburns and it is perfect.</li>
            <li>then I think this is a fine choice.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Since this is pretty much meant for beards and nether regions, I can vouch that it works great for both of those things.    </li>
            <li>and it was fine.</li>
            <li>It does pull on my beard at times, but works fine for shaving my head.</li>
            <li>but I think for beard trimming its fine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worked fine as a shaver.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, easy to clean and nice crisp trim.</li>
            <li>Comfortable and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>They are easy to use, easy to adjust, and easy to clean.  </li>

            <li>Is very adjustable from bald to a good full beard setting.</li>
            <li>The comb/guide comes off and on easily, and is comfortable on my face.&lt;br /&gt;Clean up:</li>
            <li>The issue is taking the adjuster off to do the fine lines.  </li>
            <li>While I don&#x27;t use it &amp;#34;wet,&amp;#34; I do rather enjoy the easy cleaning</li>
            <li>It is light and easy to use.</li>
            <li>It is still running just fine.  </li>
            <li>The charging stand looks nice and the trimmer sits securely in it, overall very pleased with this</li>
            <li>It worked fine for trimming body hair in the shower.  </li>
            <li>But the biggest problem is, when you take the head off to do some fine detail trimming or trim around your mouth, it pulls your hair out.  </li>
            <li>Light, easy to use, and gets the job done.</li>
            <li>I love it for a quick trim of the beard.</li>
            <li>Smart, easy, effective.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Quick and easy to shave&lt;br /&gt;Quick and easy to clean and adjust&lt;br /&gt;Small, light and easy to hold</li>

            <li>Makes trimming his beard so much easier and it looks way better!</li>
            <li>Good ergonomics, easy recharging, and not hard to keep clean.</li>
            <li>simple to use and easy  great charger.  </li>
            <li>Nice touch making the ends of the prongs rounded so an accidental poke doesn&#x27;t smart.  </li>
            <li>This has a smooth, comfortable plastic guard that does a fine job of protecting you from nicks and electric razor burns.</li>
            <li>While you may be able to get a better one, this unit certainly gives you a huge bang for your buck.</li>
            <li>just as described ...but better!&lt;br /&gt;price is fair, holds charge for long time, nice clean cut, great settings would definitely recommend!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>

            <li>It has a light</li>
            <li>Panasonic trimmer is easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li>Light but feels solid.&lt;br</li>
            <li>charging I place it in the drawer, but if looks are important, this trimmer gets a 5 in</li>
            <li>The light on the stand will either be on, meaning the trimmer is on the stand, or the light will be off.  </li>
            <li>Easy to clean</li>
            <li>The adjustable comb broke on me, one of the teeth that securely fastens the comb to the blade did anyway, and trying to use it after that was just a fumble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>My beard is just gonna be grateful for this smooth, trimming experience.</li>
            <li>I was looking for two things in a trimmer: 1) a precise hair depth cut adjustment and 2) not noisy to wake my wife in the morning.</li>
            <li>: The trimmer is comfortable to hold while trimming.</li>
            <li>It fits nicely in the hand and has a reasonable amount of adjustability.</li>
            <li>and I think I may be use to its&#x27; more powerful feel in your hand when you turn it</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is well-made apart from the fact that the battery and blade are really cheap</li>
            <li>Wish it had attachments but is a precise trimmer for beards.</li>
            <li>Great product, the only problem I find is the need to lubricate it after each use.</li>
            <li>easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean hair from it.</li>
            <li>Bizarre...</li>
            <li>I bought this primarily to use as hair clippers.  </li>
            <li>it does everything, it has a very solid build quality too, feels great in hand.</li>
            <li>The engineering on this product makes it easy to use, clean, and charge whenever and wherever.</li>
            <li>easy to clean and meets all that is advertised</li>
            <li>Lightweight, but bordering on feeling too light</li>
            <li>(mostly light trimming).  </li>
            <li>cheap hair trimmer (you know...</li>
            <li>Overall great item</li>
            <li>So easy to clean and holds a charge for a sufficient amount of time.</li>
            <li>But having tested many trimmers over my many bearded years, the Panasonic is nowhere near the top.</li>
            <li>adjusting knob is really precise</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and maintain.  </li>
            <li>charging stand is solid and attractive on the counter.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>It does not feel comfortable when trying to get a 3.5 trim.</li>
            <li>It is good so far.</li>
            <li>it is still old school for a good clipper.</li>
            <li>Good so far.  </li>
            <li>This is far superior to that one.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>This is far superior.  </li>
            <li>By far the easiest and most effective trimmer I have every used.  </li>
            <li>This product is working good so far.</li>
            <li>So far it has done a good job.</li>
            <li>So Far So Good.</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>I love the charging stand and has a good solid feel in my hand.</li>
            <li>Lightweight, holds charge for a while, fabulous in the shower or sink, and the height adjustability is very useful.  </li>
            <li>i am totally hair free....!!!</li>
            <li>Really!?!?!  </li>
            <li>Very powerful and reliable.</li>
            <li>However, it is very effective at what it does and simple to make hair length adjustments.</li>
            <li>Very nice, simple to use trimmer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is so so easy to clean, and it is water proof of course so that i can use it in the shower and clean it in the sink etc.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to adjust and I really like that it is chargeable so there are no annoying cords to deal with.</li>
            <li>Lots of battery, sharp blades, easy to clean, stand looks good on the counter!</li>
            <li>The head guard is easy to remove and clean and the precise height adjustment makes it easy to get the right length of cut.  </li>
            <li>Charges up quickly and trims easily.  </li>
            <li>I recommend it for those who want a quick, easy trim.</li>
            <li>Changing trim length is super easy with the dial.</li>
            <li>Because I&#x27;ve never used a different beard trimmer I can&#x27;t speak to whether another trimmer might be just as good for less money, but I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li>The blades cut through hair easily, and the length is quick to dial in.</li>
            <li>The fact that I can dial the length setting makes adjusting the setting quick and easy.  </li>
            <li>Cleans easily, charges quick, and you can use it in the shower.</li>
            <li>It is so easy to change the length by twisting the dial to quickly chose any look.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very well-engineered product that&#x27;s very very easy to maintain and clean.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s amazing and high quality.</li>
            <li>High quality construction and nicely styled.</li>
            <li>It was replaced quickly and the second unit has been great- until today (June of 2017).  </li>
            <li>He said it works great, better than his previous unit</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is also super easy to clean.</li>
            <li>This is a wet/dry unit, so clean up is quick and easy.</li>
            <li>I was concerned with the range in beard height (up to 10mm), but after using it for the past month, i have found 6.5mm to be perfect for me.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money!</li>
            <li>I get a more consistent trim on my beard, works get on body hair as well.</li>
            <li>Works Great, Holds Charge for a long time</li>
            <li>Good for general manscaping</li>
            <li>overall nice!</li>
            <li>I use it primarily to trim my beard, this is the third trimmer that I have owned and this one is the best by far.</li>
            <li>It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, you just need to but more time into it than I am willing to put in I guess.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the money too!</li>
            <li>The waterproof aspect is why I took a chance on it originally.</li>
            <li>In short it&#x27;s an awesome trimmer, but you better remember to slap it back on the charger when you&#x27;re done.</li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t be using this in close quarters while someone else is sleeping if you want to maintain a friendly relationship.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works great and the charge lasts a long time for my use.</li>
            <li>Works great, goes a long time without having to recharge.</li>
            <li>Well worth every penny!</li>
            <li>my first orders charger braked and that changed it and its working fantastic, I recommend this product for everyone, its beautiful, silent and works great.&lt;br /&gt;its</li>
            <li>It has not disappointed.</li>
            <li>But, I gifted this to him firstly because its all in one product.</li>
            <li>worth every penny!</li>
            <li>So when I opened this package, I was really excited.</li>
            <li>I was hoping by spending more money on a beard trimmer it would be of higher quality.  </li>
            <li>Very comfortable to hold and looks nice enough to keep in its charger on the bathroom counter - sort of.</li>
            <li>I previously bought the panasonic wet/dry shaver and the quality very good.</li>
            <li>Does a good job on my beard, and I am informed (ahem) that it also works very well for a certain woman to trim around her bikini line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Does a very nice job...much better than my previous trimmer.  </li>
            <li>You can really get your stubble to a very fine length with this puppy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>is perfect for getting those tough areas at the top of your ears.  </li>
            <li>great clippers,  ultra sharp, and the adjustable length settings are a neat feature that makes your trimming really easy and even</li>
            <li>Has great power and long battery life!</li>
            <li>I was excited to try out this shaver, since I&#x27;ve tried many and found only one that I liked: the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>i have used many other brands and this is by far the best.  </li>
            <li>We got this because my boyfriend cuts his own hair and he needed a new hair shaver.</li>
            <li>Want to clean the head?</li>
            <li>I tried a popular department store brand before I tried this, and this is much better quality even though almost the same price.</li>
            <li>The clipper guard itself seems to be precariously connected to the system and pulling it out to clean it almost feels like you are going to break it.</li>
            <li>I have tried several electric shavers, and this is by far the best!  </li>
            <li>you can clean it up with water, but would not buy another.</li>
            <li>Makes clean up a breeze.  </li>
            <li>I used to be able to hold my old trimmer away from my face and still cut which allowed for a better view while trimming.</li>
            <li>He loves the fact that you can rinse it under water to clean.</li>
            <li>Also, you can use it in the shower and clean it with water, so that&#x27;s convenient.</li>
            <li>This is a very to use product and it is able to do a smooth job without pulling the hair out by the roots.</li>
            <li>It gave me a clean shave.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve only been using it for about a month, but so far we are VERY happy with the product.</li>
            <li>Would recommend for anyone who likes to keep trim and clean.</li>
            <li>fully charged this has an incredible battery life, however the trimmer does not have any indicator to let you know when the battery is dying or how much life you have left.  </li>
            <li>biggest benefit of this trimmer is probably the fact that you can use it in the shower, and clean it by running water through it.  </li>
            <li>With that said, I still find it faster to wash this under water and apply 3 drops of oil, then have to clean the trimmer with a brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>clean is defiantly a plus,</li>
            <li>Shorten up my beard to an accurate length quickly (</li>
            <li>And the clean up is a snap too.</li>
            <li>After using it the 5th time when I pulled the guide off to clean the blade area, the tip of of the two pieces in the handle that hold the guard in place snapped off.</li>
            <li>pros: you can clean with water</li>
            <li>because it didnt give me a clean shave(leaves you with a 5&#x27;oclock</li>
            <li>water proof makes cleaning a breeze just wish it had the ability to remove the guard to clean up the edges.</li>
            <li>, I use this in the shower and keep my vanity clean.</li>
            <li>Like clean out feature.</li>
            <li>This simple addition is mind-blowingly effective in making sure that the comb keeps the hair at the selected level without interfering with it&#x27;s contact with the blades.  </li>
            <li>The unit has a pleasant low level hum when working.</li>
            <li>Without the length adjuster on top it seems good and sharper than expected for precision trimming.</li>
            <li>It works great in and out of the shower and the single adjustable guide is genius.</li>
            <li>the overwhelming number of positive reviews would make you think so too, but that WAS NOT the case.</li>
            <li>I bought this one for my son, and I liked it so much I am ordering one for myself right now.</li>
            <li>work very good for trimming my tee... takes a little practice</li>
            <li>Highly adjustable, super easy to clean, charge stays strong, easy to grip even in soapy shower.  </li>
            <li>In his words, it shaves very smooth and doesnt vibrate much.</li>
            <li>It does not make much noise and is very smooth on the skin</li>
            <li>Super user friendly and a cinch to clean and lube.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m really in love with this, I appreciate the stand, that&#x27;s purely aesthetically-pleasing though.  </li>
            <li>It could use a bit more power, as it pulls the hair when using it in certain directions, like when making the beard outline.  </li>
            <li>I was right!</li>
            <li>It trims my goatee just right !</li>
            <li>Quiet, holds a good charge,easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li>The stand is kinda&#x27; big and clunky and not as good when you are trying to keep the bathroom counter cleared off and looking neat and clean.  </li>
            <li>Constant oiling of the device is required for good clean cuts.</li>
            <li>The control over trimming length and ability to rinse/get wet is great.</li>
            <li>I have used many trimmers in the past and the Remington brand worked great.</li>
            <li>Worked as expected, great battery life.</li>
            <li>It provides an even, consistent, and fully adjustable trim and is so easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>This thing is small but excellent, worth the money.</li>
            <li>Accurately and quickly tidy up my neckline and trim stubble below it with the bare trimmer blade</li>
            <li>I have been using it just for a few days, but first impression is AWESOME!</li>
            <li>Nice product, exactly as advertised, fast shipping.</li>
            <li>It is amazing the difference between this and my old beard trimmer.</li>
            <li>They devote two full pages to \\&quot;how to trim your beard\\&quot;, with lavish illustrations.</li>
            <li>He uses it all the time but for those really close shaves you do need a razor for smooth skin!</li>
            <li>I was very hesitant to purchase this, but I am glad i did.  </li>
            <li>a MUCH more precise instrument that simply does a better job than any Wahl trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Thats cool).</li>
            <li>I think it will take a full explanation of why the cancelations before I consider ordering anything from Amazon again.  </li>
            <li>does good for short hair&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>Just take care of it by following the directions specified by the manufacturer, and it should be a good device.</li>
            <li>The shaver lasted for 4 full trims without charging.</li>
            <li>It has a good trimmer-guard which delivers evenly-cut facial hair.</li>
            <li>Works very well and love the adjustable head unit.</li>
            <li>Also, there is no indicator of how full the battery is or even if it&#x27;s fully charged.</li>
            <li>I keep a full beard and use for trimming and shaping.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had 1 of these for about a year and decided it would make a good B-day present for my Twin bro...</li>
            <li>Clippers that are designed to be doing full haircuts have longer comb attachments than this one.</li>
            <li>They give me the full refund when I has a issue with the trimmer.</li>
            <li>This product helps you keep your beard trimmed so you can avoid ingrown hairs and has a lot of cool features.  </li>
            <li>I just love that part and it is very convenient to use.</li>
            <li>i returned  this because unit sent to did allow full cleaning of cutter blade.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s good for hitting some spots but adds to the time needed to trim larger areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>good for short beard</li>
            <li>the full spectrum of graduated settings and the ease of</li>
            <li>it has just a NiMH battery instead of a more modern lithium battery.</li>
            <li>Waterproof is good, if only for ease in cleaning.</li>
            <li>I love the adjustable head, so much easier than my Wahl</li>
            <li>It has so many setting which makes it very versatile.</li>
            <li>I have only good things to say about it.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s really just better to go find a barber who&#x27;ll do it well and inexpensively.</li>
            <li>Looks cool and holds a charge for weeks.</li>
            <li>The ease was even misleading to the point that we gave them a try in a full haircut.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know that there were such superior trimmers out there.  </li>
            <li>can&#x27;t imagine going to another beard trimmer now, without equal or superior performance.  </li>
            <li>can&#x27;t imagine going to another beard trimmer now, without equal or superior performance.  </li>
            <li>I love the charging dock that comes with it, very convenient.</li>
            <li>It feels good in hand, and has several length settings in .5 increments.  </li>
            <li>On a good note-its quiet.</li>
            <li>The waterproof design and .5 increments are greatly appreciated. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>Works ok but for me this and every beard trimmer i&#x27;ve owned just doesn&#x27;t cut very evenly.  </li>
            <li>Will last 10+ years with good care.</li>
            <li>My goatee is the only thing the trimmer is good for.</li>
            <li>The charging cradle is nice and so far the battery works well.</li>
            <li>You have to go against the grain, or hair angle to get good results and then go over and over it multiple times.</li>
            <li>The final result is good.</li>
            <li>Needed and loved for daily maintenance.</li>
            <li>Many usable settings (unusual among trimmers - this has some really good settings for short beards)&lt;br</li>
            <li>Used for my balding head, works fairly well; waterproof a big plus as can use in shower with no clean-up to speak of.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true.  </li>
            <li>But I though, surely there&#x27;s room for improvement, and the Panasonic, with it&#x27;s built-in adjusting wheel seemed promising.</li>
            <li>This is basically a $10 trimmer with a bunch of really cool options.</li>
            <li>Works as expected battery life good and easy to clean and maintain.</li>
            <li>I found the teeth of the comb/guide too far apart to effectively lift my beard for trimming.</li>
            <li>But for regular use, it&#x27;s a fair trade off to not have a cord dangling in my way.  </li>
            <li>This Panasonic machine is not bad</li>
            <li>This is never a bad thing in regards to a -- \\&quot;man groomer\\&quot; tool.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been a little over a week, and it still seems fully charged, which is good news for taking it on trips!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Now, on the positive side, this is great for men who have facial hair.</li>
            <li>The battery life is incredible on this, i can shave for weeks at a time without ever having to charge this thing, and it doesn&#x27;t start degrading the performance of the trimmer as the battery drains, its a very consistent experience until the battery is almost completely dead.  </li>
            <li>So easy to set he length of my beard, and be consistent with it.</li>
            <li>This trimmer is easy to adjust and it works pretty well.</li>
            <li>Not long after buying it, the non-replaceable battery was no longer able to hold its charge for more than a day or so.  </li>
            <li>Have that&#x27;s used the dry mode thus far, but it&#x27;s an excellent and very exact trimmer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The most important things that I wanted in a beard trimmer was something that would be quiet, work quickly and evenly, and clean up easily.  </li>
            <li>I use this to shave my scalp/head every other day and it works great.</li>
            <li>My other shaver I rearly oiled and it cut great.</li>
            <li>Best cordless shaver I&#x27;ve bought in awhile and has lasted long time without charging that&#x27;s a major plus</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s easy to clean and maintain (comes with ample oil to treat blades between use) and is built very well with the consumer in mind.  </li>
            <li>I also love the ability to adjust so many different lengths.</li>
            <li>I take a quick look to see if there is any excess build up I thought that might have ben the problem</li>
            <li>I used to have a forfex which was recommended by a professional hair stylist, and although the motor and blades were top notch, the attachments were cheap, brittle plastic from china and kept breaking.  </li>
            <li>when I switched to the Panasonic I found that it worked better and had decent batteries and charging system..</li>
            <li>Quick adjust dial.  </li>
            <li>it was the same one that lasted for many many years</li>
            <li>Battery life and power are adequate don&#x27;t be convinced that lithium ion is where it&#x27;s at..</li>
            <li>The Philips felt more powerful, but the way the trimmer guard attached to it was very flimsy and one fall would probably break</li>
            <li>Although it undoubtedly will be reliable and durable, this trimmer is merely adequate and nothing</li>
            <li>dropped it from my hand 2-3 times but luckily there wasn&#x27;t any damage</li>
            <li>Thanks for making such a great product Panasonic.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to trim my beard and shape it exactly how I want at the exact length that I want it.</li>
            <li>and you can read far more detailed reviews from others.  </li>
            <li>I have to pass it over the same spots many, many times.</li>
            <li>it is quick and doesn&#x27;t irritate his skin.</li>
            <li>And forget any type of close shave, I was better off with the generic CVS brand one to get more options for closer shave.  </li>
            <li>It has a very ergonomic design which fits great in your hand and the blue part has a rubbery texture to it.</li>
            <li>Having so many different settings makes it more versatile than most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can quickly change lengths.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Could be more utilitarian for short hair if there were more settings-</li>
            <li>since soap dries quickly when you aren&#x27;t under the water.  </li>
            <li>The best thing of this device is that opening and cleaning the device is a matter of pulling various parts off, blowing air, then plugging it back together.</li>
            <li>It just doesn&#x27;t grab and cut the hair quickly</li>
            <li>bought this after reading so many reviews of trimmers on here and this seemed to get quite a few good reviews.</li>
            <li>On me, it will shorten it so that appears like a mild &amp;#34;5 O&#x27;clock shadow&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>is tremendous machine.</li>
            <li>Battery dies too quickly for manly men.</li>
            <li>Yes: frequent oiling is important for extending the life of most trimmers.  </li>
            <li>Really cuts my beard well and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Received quickly and comes with everything you need.</li>
            <li>It just doesn&#x27;t seem like the motor is moving as quickly, like</li>
            <li>Very easy to clear stubble and never looses its charge.</li>
            <li>I have seen high ratings for this product from many sources including &amp;quot;Men&#x27;s Journal&amp;quot;</li>
            <li>Outstanding product - adjustable settings gets the look you are going for - highly recommend this trimmer.</li>
            <li>Has a much better range of settings for a super close neat 5 o&#x27;clock shadow look then the 4 other trimers i own.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use, light, doesn&#x27;t vibrate your hand off, quiet, holds a charge, and trims my beard perfectly in just a few passes.</li>
            <li>The very first time I used this trimmer (was on 7.5mm setting)</li>
            <li>and I cannot say how very pleased I am overall.</li>
            <li>my husband is very pleased with all the different settings he can trim his beard with.</li>
            <li>Never in my history of doing business with Amazon have I experienced so many notifications of an item being purchased and shipped only to find the next day</li>
            <li>I use it primarily for removing body hair and found it to be pretty efficient.</li>
            <li>I tried two other options before this Panasonic, this is by far the best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>the cheap 20$ walmart junk I bought first.</li>
            <li>The instructions make it sound pretty high-maintenance, we&#x27;ll see how it goes.</li>
            <li>Great idea, and it works OK, but I have to go over the same area multiple times to get the hairs clipped.</li>
            <li>Keeps a good charge for a long time.</li>
            <li>I can confidently state that I will always own this trimmer or the closest version Panasonic has to offer well into the future, because my beard has never looked this good before with so little effort.</li>
            <li>So this beard trimmer is great at getting your hairs down to 10mm or shorter.</li>
            <li>A great trimmer for the shower, where all the hair goes down the drain instead of over the bathroom floor.  </li>
            <li>Shaves better than expected, very easy to set for correct beard length.</li>
            <li>It holds a charge for a long time, and the best thing is that it is super quiet.</li>
            <li>love this trimmer and use it much more often than I do my other shaver that gives you a smooth shave (I use both, depending on the look I want for the day).  </li>
            <li>Does tremendous work and very compact and comfortable , overall very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>Very well made, easy to use.</li>
            <li>It does a nice job with the facial follicles and has plenty of adjustments from sandpaper skin to full on hobo.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and is very versatile.  </li>
            <li>Cleans up easily without much effort, like that I can use in shower.</li>
            <li>Overall pretty good trimmer.</li>
            <li>, you could easily make the mistake the shaver is set to 10mm when it is really at 3mm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall</li>
            <li>I use it pretty much everywhere except for the top of my head.</li>
            <li>The Panasonic looks good, but does not live up to  </li>
            <li>beast mowed down a 4 week old &amp;#34;I-don&#x27;t-want-to-shave-because-owwies-will-happen-beard&amp;#34;, with the greatest of ease.  </li>
            <li>The shaver itself is perfect, but it only came with a full cradle for charging which is not very convenient for travelling</li>
            <li>Hope it will last many years!</li>
            <li>I wish he would use this, he is hot with scruff!</li>
            <li>He was so happy with this model that we simply stuck with it rather than trying out something new</li>
            <li>I chose this one and have enjoyed the variety of settings, it is quiet and cleans easily.  </li>
            <li>Love it easy to use and quiet.</li>
            <li>This is so easy to use, so many length choices and works well, a must have for anyone with a moderate beard.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s solidly built and very easy to clean, and the guard is built in</li>
            <li>/&gt;Trimming the weeks worth of growth was okay, it seemed to get pretty close, however it required multiple passes to make sure that an area was clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lot more convenient than my old, cheaper one, and I really like how easy it is to change the trimming length.</li>
            <li>Works well, just need to clean consistently</li>
            <li>quiet, powerful, durable, very easy to clean</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this is a great little trimmer.</li>
            <li>Great little bush wacker</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quiet and feels good in my rather large hands.</li>
            <li>The height adjustments are great and it is a powerful little unit.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice product, could use a little more power</li>
            <li>I feel pretty special.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very nice to use in the shower and not create a mess all over your counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>will up it to 5 if it is still working great after a few months.</li>
            <li>It is light weight and feels very sturdy.  </li>
            <li>Great trim, even in a heavy beard.</li>
            <li>Had used a much cheaper Remington trimmer before that needed a cheap repair.  </li>
            <li>The dial is legible, the movements are smooth, it is quiet, easy to clean and the parts and pieces fit together well.  </li>
            <li>The wet/dry design makes them safe to use on wet hair and make them easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Cuts smooth and fast without snagging.  </li>
            <li>it will result in a very close and precise buzz.</li>
            <li>It has plenty of length options, it&#x27;s comfortable in the hand, and it does a great job with my thick beard.</li>
            <li>The extension is very sturdy and accurate to 0.5mm</li>
            <li>Trimmer works fantastic is quiet and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>without the guard isn&#x27;t as smooth as some on the face, but that is what razors are for..best trimmer I have ever used.it lives on the charger, and it is made to not &#x27;over&#x27;-charge which is very convenient</li>
            <li>The clipper seems underpowered for doing sideburns, the attachment for adjusting how much to cut is cheap plastic.  </li>
            <li>Going back to a Norelco for a more comfortable groom.</li>
            <li>liked the design &amp; that it was quiet.</li>
            <li>It is very quiet compared to his old one and does a great job at shaving.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>This is a nice trimmer, so far I really like it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>Powerful trimmer.</li>
            <li>I was able to extend it to 5mm and still get into the areas that I wanted to trim without any unexpected effort.</li>
            <li>It stays nice and short while still having it look like 5 o&#x27;clock shadow.</li>
            <li>Totally worth the money.  </li>
            <li>as expected, good value</li>
            <li>The design is awesome, but poorly executed.</li>
            <li>i had so much fun with this</li>
            <li>Worth the cost, and then some.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>product is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I do use this shaver to pre-shave my head and facial whiskers before hand shaving with a Gillette mechanical shaver to get the shine that I most enjoy.</li>
            <li>Worth the price and then some.  </li>
            <li>But worth the money.</li>
            <li>it is surely worth</li>
            <li>I own three different trimmers.</li>
            <li>I thought twice about paying the price, but this trimmer is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Given that Panasonic is one of the top two manufacturers of Nickel-metal hydride batteries in the world, I shouldn&#x27;t have been surprised.</li>
            <li>My old Panasonic trimmer was much better.</li>
            <li>My husband has issues with his skin that making shaving not so fun.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Hey, they tell me to be as honest as possible on these Vine reviews, so there it is.</li>
            <li>Does a nice job overall.</li>
            <li>The water-flow maintenance hole is pretty cool.</li>
            <li>handy-- Especially for a wet/dry trimmer!</li>
            <li>/&gt;As far as the charging stand goes, if you are someone that likes to keep things on top of your counter</li>
            <li>I would not buy this for regular price, and honestly if I had to replace it, I wouldn&#x27;t spend $59 on again either.  </li>
            <li>I tried 4 different trimmers before this one,  also has a nice weight on it.</li>
            <li>I had to replace a trimmer that must be 15 or more years old.</li>
            <li>So far I have enjoyed this item as I have almost everything I have ever purchased from Panasonic.</li>
            <li>This razor is the softest, quietest I&#x27;ve ever heard and it clearly does chop hair but if the manufacturer gave it MORE TORQUE</li>
            <li>Additionally, you can only charge it using the included charging dock, which is a nice touch and looks really nice, but it&#x27;s definitely a pain to pack when traveling.</li>
            <li>I was recommended this from a friend and is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Nice and quiet.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as powerful as is claimed and takes a while to trim your beard with the guard on&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>best face/body hair trimmer i&#x27;ve found, but still desperately needs a more powerful motor.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>For the price it is worth it if you are on the market for  a body trimmer.</li>
            <li>Even after charging razor did not seem powerful and did not cut beard even.  </li>
            <li>Not even a case useful for travel.</li>
            <li>We actually returned one cause he loved this soo much</li>
            <li>It runs very quiet and trims nicely.</li>
            <li>The soft grip handle has a great feel and the trimmer itself is a quiet hum.</li>
            <li>have to admit, I&#x27;m not crazy about the recharging stand.  </li>
            <li>I hope that feature proves to be durable, but I like not having removable attachments.  </li>
            <li>Much better term than my old Phillips, which is saying a lot.</li>
            <li>i have tried a few brands before but this is the best so far.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t seem all too powerful.</li>
            <li>So many reviews out there list this as the best cordless beard trimmer, and it is so blatantly obvious that none of these reviewers have ever used it or ever used it on an actual beard grown from human hair.</li>
            <li>I would probably oil more frequently if I washed it with water each time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Although the construction of the item is solid and would have been nice</li>
            <li>And most importantly, it does cut quite well and is relatively silent.  </li>
            <li>None were worth the time.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>The charging station is pretty cool.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and high quality.</li>
            <li>however if you are looking to keep yourself looking like a nice European model, then you have found the right trimmer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad that I went with my gut on this one, some of the other reviews weren&#x27;t the best, there were a few complains about the charging.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll notice the trimmer itself is a bit narrower that most other trimmers, and while that means it may take more time to buzz</li>
            <li>He was SUPER impressed with all the settings and that it&#x27;s a Wet &amp; Dry trimmer &amp; shaver</li>
            <li>They are the best in the industry in my opinion, and this is due to several reasons: fast and relatively silent electric motor, capability of using them in both dry and wet mode, close shave, nicely engineered head and good to excellent overall quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I realized the settings on this razor vs the ones at my barbershop differ tremendously.  </li>
            <li>the end, like I mentioned at the top, this is a decent trimmer, but is nothing to write home about, and it is very overpriced.  </li>
            <li>No sound, nice grip, small so you can get best results.</li>
            <li>Good quality product, sharp &amp; well designed.</li>
            <li>It works good on beard and other areas, also.</li>
            <li>so I decided to add in my own two cents about how great this wet dry razor really is.</li>
            <li>I love the way it works and how easy it is to break down and clean under the faucet</li>
            <li>Hopefully the manual is right about it not overcharging.</li>
            <li>Something about it doesn&#x27;t seem quite right.  </li>
            <li>Right out of the box, the shaver was damaged and had to be returned for a replacement.</li>
            <li>If that sounds right to you</li>
            <li>The people at Panasonic got it right</li>
            <li>Used to fight with my shaver to get the right setting and or to keep it on the right setting.</li>
            <li>And all are right here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t feel right in my hand.  </li>
            <li>So as of right now I’m waiting for the oil to arrive before I can use the product.</li>
            <li>Just had to getting my beard trimming setting right.  </li>
            <li>I got the Panasonic after work today and  gave it a try right away.  </li>
            <li>The ez to use dial depth gauge makes finding the right hair length a breeze.</li>
            <li>but it does pop right off.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just going to trust that they&#x27;re right.</li>
            <li>right?</li>
            <li>For the face it does the job right.</li>
            <li>The micro adjustment on the height of the cut is especially well done and easy to fine tune.</li>
            <li>This trimmer is a huge upgrade from my older Remington trimmer.</li>
            <li>Power was minimal at best and it took a long time to trim my beard.</li>
            <li>Very adjustable and cuts cleanly.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so much easier to clean with the way water can flow through it.</li>
            <li>Cleanup can be a real chore with some trimmers, but this one washes off clean in seconds.</li>
            <li>Love the .5mm adjustments, I use it to trim my beard and have pretty sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I really would not want to clean this thing out with brushes and compressed air.</li>
            <li>I have had many trimmers in the past, but this one is really nice.</li>
            <li>This shaver still feels like higher quality and still far better than the Norelco BodyGroom and Panasonic ER224s.  </li>
            <li>The first thing you notice on this trimmer is that its considerable longer than most devices like it.</li>
            <li>This easy clean-up was the most compelling reason I was attracted to the idea of \\&quot;wet shaving\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>I think they had to take this approach to make it safe for use in the shower, but I much prefer the normal charging method of plugging something into the body of the shaver itself.  </li>
            <li>but of course when you go to use it, it trims like a beast, very easy, numerous guard settings.....................</li>
            <li>Great for daily beard trimming to just that right tight trim level for the slightly more than stubble</li>
            <li>Otherwise, its fantastic and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>the cutter head pops off and re-inserts easily, with no small parts to break or weaken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Apparently, technology should run on fairy dust and magical rainbow farts or something.</li>
            <li>Apparently, technology should run on fairy dust and magical rainbow farts or something.</li>
            <li>This machines blade is small and it really isn&#x27;t great...</li>
            <li>However, we have had great service from Panasonic products in the past</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had several shavers by various manufacturers, and this has been the best so far.</li>
            <li>first thing I used it for was to trim the 2 weeks worth of growth that I had, and then to get my goatee even.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it a couple of times, but it is so far the best facial trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>&gt;  Simple &amp; ergonomic design makes it easy to operate!</li>
            <li>The adjustability is quite fine tuned, in increments of .5mm (wow!).  </li>
            <li>The adjustability is quite fine tuned, in increments of .5mm (wow!).  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s dirt simple and cleans easily!  </li>
            <li>Even the first two years and a half was awesome, time to change it on the third anniversary.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t</li>
            <li>This is easy to use, easy to clean, and allows me to trim down the spots that need trimming.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and works well so far</li>
            <li>Very solidly constructed and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>You can easily change the length (I always use the shortest length) and they are completely water resistant.</li>
            <li>Simple to operate and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>The dial allows you to easily and clearly select the comb length.  </li>
            <li>The Panasonic is easy to clean and oil for proper preventative maintenance.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really easy to clean, and it feels relatively solid, but the fact that the instructions tell you to oil the blades before each &amp; every use makes me wonder just how durable this</li>
            <li>The good is that the trimmer settings work well and don&#x27;t slip from one setting to another as has happened with a previous trimmer.</li>
            <li>and I love it will wear everyday and show off to everyone that asks, plan on ordering more...</li>
            <li>Fairly quiet, great range of thickness, and all in all just a terrific product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to remove the comb and expose the blade directly.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used it much yet, but so far am extremely pleased with it.</li>
            <li>The charge is a bit flimsy, but the trimmer fits nicely in it&#x27;s place and the charger doesn&#x27;t take any real abuse, so it may last for years.</li>
            <li>I own mine over a year &amp; just bought this one for my teenage son because I like mine so much (&amp; he keeps taking mine).</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, my previous experience was with the \\&quot;Remington Titanium\\&quot; trimmer, and I loved it, but the battery stopped charging</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does tend to get whiskers lodged in the guard, but it&#x27;s easy enough to pop off and clean.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the quick mail out.</li>
            <li>Pretty simple on this; it fits the hand nicely, the head isn&#x27;t overly large so you can pop off the attachment and do detail work, and the motor provides ample power to clip hair</li>
            <li>The trimmer cuts my goatee fine, but requires more maintenance than any other razor I have had.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a special water port specifically designed for rinsing - so far, not helping tremendously.</li>
            <li>I got it pretty quick, very light weight and holds a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is maybe a good product for a man who wants to maintain a two-day stubble of a chin or has a goatee, but it&#x27;s not good for anything more than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This reduces the opportunity for pinched hair for folks with particularly coarse facial hair, although I don&#x27;t know many people with fine facial hair--so this might be a completely negligible consideration for most but the final point is that this trimmer will be less-likely to pinch hair and more apt to provide an even trim with fewer passes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>very light weight and stays charged for several uses</li>
            <li>Yes I like it very much.</li>
            <li>Would very much recommend for trim and travel.&lt;br /&gt;Get</li>
            <li>The guard is also very comfortable to run across your face unlike my last trimmer.</li>
            <li>The length adjuster (how close of a shave you want) is very precise from 1 mm up to 10mm, although I actually take the adjuster off and trim it to...</li>
            <li>It is Rechargable, quiet, lightweight and very comfortable to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t</li>
            <li>10mm is not very long, so look elsewhere if you want more like 1/4in</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom Line - this is a really good beard trimmer that feels nice in the hand, and offers excellent precision and cutting ability for regularly maintained beards.for regularly maintained beards.</li>
            <li>This is a good little rechargeable trimmer.</li>
            <li>You can use it in water, but my charger broke after the first charging.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re constantly running it through water, would you need to reapply oil more?</li>
            <li>It has a fast, powerful motor.</li>
            <li>The trimmer is much better quality than the body trimmer I had prior</li>
            <li>I tried it on my arm first</li>
            <li>Did exactly what it said it would and priced well</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE:  The first one I bought broke within a week-</li>
            <li>density)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am willing to accept it may be me and not the trimmer</li>
            <li>It was exactly what he was looking for.  </li>
            <li>after getting married I started trimming my beard in the shower to keep from getting hair all over the sink.  </li>
            <li>hours for first charge.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My one dislike is that the recharging light stays on constantly and you are never quite sure when the battery is completely charge.  </li>
            <li>Exceeded expectations up to this point if it doesn&#x27;t tear up and will last :)</li>
            <li>but then perhaps I had higher expectations.</li>
            <li>Charged it abroad the first time w/o noticing it</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time after I got it yesterday.</li>
            <li>Overall its okay</li>
            <li>Quote: Before returning to the seller, contact Panasonic first).</li>
            <li>Fantastic shave; quiet, precise and very well made.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this item!!</li>
            <li>Pretty inconsistent machine.</li>
            <li>I ordered a second pair for my brother and we both love it.</li>
            <li>I can only use it one time and then it needs to be recharged, I wish it had acted up during the first 30 days, for sure</li>
            <li>Been through so many similar types of trimmers and this thing is just designed well.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space and it&#x27;s pretty user-friendly.</li>
            <li>This is my fourth Panasonic shaver, and I love all of them....</li>
            <li>Better luck next year</li>
            <li>Love that you can leave trimmer on recharger and not have to worry about it only being plugged in for 90 minutes or it will ruin trimmer.  </li>
            <li>If I had a full thick beard I&#x27;d have no doubt that when it seems to drop in power it would struggle more to give a quick and clean cut.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what I want it for.  </li>
            <li>Consistent performance.</li>
            <li>I believe this is the first time I have ever written a product review.</li>
            <li>Seems to do exactly what advertised.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have the ability to collect hair within the body like my prior shaver had, but I still like this more.</li>
            <li>I had charged the trimmer about 18 hours overnight before first use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say this beard trimmer does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what I want it to do and does it well.</li>
            <li>I had higher expectations for this product.  </li>
            <li>Holds charge pretty well</li>
            <li>This is a very well made trimmer!  </li>
            <li>I only wish that it could have more than a 10mm range.</li>
            <li>I do wish the head was a bit smaller for more even strokes, as sometimes going perpendicular to the jawline can lead to a shorter cut just under the jaw.</li>
            <li>it is the first time I charged and do not work.....</li>
            <li>Works pretty well.</li>
            <li>Does it&#x27;s job exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>0,5mm steps helps getting better control over the short length.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Found myself with a beard for the first time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been almost a year and no complaints, he really likes it, thank goodness for both of us!</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t vouch for how it works in the shower, or trims while wet as I have not used it in that capacity yet, but I can say that my beard always looks nicely groomed.</li>
            <li>When charged it works, but battery is worth a whole heck of a lot.</li>
            <li>The adjustable comb works exactly as it should: it determines how close to the skin the clipper will clip.</li>
            <li>Lots of settings, works well, easy to clean, long battery life.</li>
            <li>I love the color personally and would buy this for my brother if he didn&#x27;t already have one!</li>
            <li>My first beard trimmer.</li>
            <li>Higher quality than the price would suggest.</li>
            <li>First of all, while you don&#x27;t have to worry about sharpening the blade, the instructions say you should oil it before and after each use.  </li>
            <li>This beard trimmer works exactly as it should and</li>
            <li>and I am not sorry I bought it.</li>
            <li>And mostly I&#x27;d like my money back.</li>
            <li>First is I wish it had a display with the battery percentage remaining.</li>
            <li>and I wasn&#x27;t the first person that happened to.  </li>
            <li>you would a stylus (and it&#x27;d be self-oiling ;) )&lt;</li>
            <li>so my beard ended up shorter than in tended, and the intervals were higher as well.</li>
            <li>The head blocks hairs more than it picks them up and a shave requires multiple passes to get all the</li>
            <li>funny thing is that even the Panasonic website doesn&#x27;t market this device as a \\&quot;body groomer\\&quot; but Amazon&#x27;s website does.  </li>
            <li>my first trial in the shower I tried shaving \\&quot;wet\\&quot; WITHOUT any liquid body wash.  </li>
            <li>Same results on the hair on top of my head.</li>
            <li>only thing is it needs more accessories</li>
            <li>I actually really like this!  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe the first time it did that as I&#x27;ve NEVER had</li>
            <li>first.</li>
            <li>He absolutely loves it!  </li>
            <li>Very convenient!</li>
            <li>I used this trimmer for the first time today.  </li>
            <li>Love the fact that it can be used in the shower and you don&#x27;t have to fumble with exchanging or storing a bunch of different sized trim head pieces.  </li>
            <li>The mini foil attachment on this unit is EXACTLY what I needed.  </li>
            <li>The depth adjustment is convenient and calibrated to allow a consistent trim.</li>
            <li>also love the fact that it has 19 settings, allowing me to keep my facial hair trimmed the exact length I want it to be.</li>
            <li>pretty and waterproof!&lt;br /&gt;from</li>
            <li>Now I can shave him in a very short time &amp; he is more relaxed.</li>
            <li>There are so many settings, so you know you will definitely find the length you need, no matter what</li>
            <li>I love the way I can adjust the shaver head for various depths of shave.</li>
            <li>It does cut okay, but it feels like it doesn&#x27;t always have enough</li>
            <li>love that you don&#x27;t need to replace plastic parts if you want a different level trim, you just turn the adjustable dial.  </li>
            <li>Works great, just not able to get a very close shave.</li>
            <li>important to me, though, is the level of precision this Panasonic Trimmer offers.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s exactly what the instructions suggest.  </li>
            <li>If you dig around in the instructions for most trimmers, they will say the same thing.  </li>
            <li>It is nice that it can be used wet.</li>
            <li>This is my first beard trimmer</li>
            <li>first thing I noticed about the Panasonic was that, when fully charged, it sounded just like my Remington did when the battery was about to die.</li>
            <li>This is the first product I&#x27;ve been burned on and the first Panasonic product I&#x27;ve ever bought.</li>
            <li>I have tried several over the years and this one is at the top of my list.  </li>
            <li>I only got this for my precious coin sack, it didn&#x27;t work there..</li>
            <li>Ergonomically designed and much more quiet than the Remington.  </li>
            <li>can&#x27;t comment on the battery life because I have not had the need to recharge it since the first 24hr charge.&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li>Not a bunch of clip on depth attachments.&lt;br /&gt;You can use in it the shower and wash it with hot water after using it so</li>
            <li>Even on the first shave it snags and pulls.</li>
            <li>First, the adjustable comb that has 19 length settings.  </li>
            <li>Good power when doing heavy trimming too.</li>
            <li>Requires a few repetition to get a good shave.</li>
            <li>So far so good, just have to see how long it holds up.</li>
            <li>Basically, if I want to trim my beard I have to set aside a weekend day to give it a few passes until it looks good.</li>
            <li>It is easy to clean and oil, and easy to adjust, though I have to say that I&#x27;ve done very little in the way of maintenance.</li>
            <li>Great for keeping the facial hair tight and clean.</li>
            <li>With this item i feel like you get all the utility of a super high end tool in the palm of your hand.</li>
            <li>, I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased, this was a flat out terrific buy as well ... !&lt;</li>
            <li>The fact that it is so easy to do and easy to clean makes it only a mild annoyance and since I&#x27;m not aware of clippers of this style that don&#x27;t need oil, I&#x27;m not going to take any stars away.  </li>
            <li>in all, I think this is a very good product for BODY GROOMING with the only real recommendation being that a little more TORQUE to the motor may help cut those pesky hairs on the first go-around versus having to hit them from multiple angles.  </li>
            <li>other than that it is a nice trimmer</li>
            <li>The dial adjust feature is particularly nice and easier than some other trimmers that have to be pushed either direction to adjust.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy so far, if it makes it past 4 months it&#x27;ll be worth the cost.</li>
            <li>Or I could choose one of the other 17 settings to get my own custom</li>
            <li>So of all the trimmers out there that claim to work in water, I would say this is by FAR the best - between the incredibly specific lengths you can adjust to and the fact that its clearly built for wet use, I&#x27;d say its 100% worth the money.  </li>
            <li>Plus it&#x27;s easy to clean as it can get wet.</li>
            <li>I bought this trimmer after my old Norelco quit because of the reviews and the ability to clean it under the faucet.  </li>
            <li>The hairs seem to clog the grooves in the comb over the blades, preventing the blades from reaching the beard, so you have to clean it frequently.</li>
            <li>I have thick facial hair and the trimmer works great!</li>
            <li>The battery life is really good and the trimmer has several different length settings.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Adjusts many increments up to 19mm or about 3/4 inch, which means even &amp;#62;1&amp;#34; thick beards may be OK because of the way the comb works.</li>
            <li>All the multiple setting suggest it is more versatile than it really is.</li>
            <li>I really hope there is something better out there with similar features</li>
            <li>The Good part is my beard was all the same length and all of the whiskers were the same length.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Be sure to use it above the 1.5mm setting unless you really want your trim &amp;#34;tight.&amp;#34</li>
            <li>This is a really good rechargeable beard trimmer intended for regularly maintained beard or facial hair.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, this is a good trimmer, for little money, and it gets the job done!</li>
            <li>Was pretty let down to be honest.</li>
            <li>My old trimmer had three settings and this one has many more, so it was a little trial and error on that, but no problem at all.</li>
            <li>Easy to adjust the settings and pretty quiet.</li>
            <li>For every positive this razor has a negative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I read the reviews and the positive ones were spot on.  </li>
            <li>The unit worked very well the first year.</li>
            <li>Took too much off the first time but works well</li>
            <li>Consistent trimming is so much easier with its dial adjustment.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really cut my beard consistently.</li>
            <li>The Wahl trimmer never seemed to hold a charge very well, though it cut pretty well.</li>
            <li>Have been pleased with the product so far.  much quieter than the 5 year old trimmer it&#x27;s replacing.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The razor didn&#x27;t seem extremely powerful but maybe that is because it is very quiet and doesn&#x27;t vibrate significantly.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d replace the whole item first.</li>
            <li>trimmer does exactly what it&#x27;s suppose to do and does it very well.</li>
            <li>and you can pretty much shave with it</li>
            <li>Loved the product, but after the first charge ran out (it lasted a long time, because I only used it about once a week to trim up my beard)</li>
            <li>Usually they don&#x27;t impress me as good or bad--just a tool.</li>
            <li>not bad so far.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the ease of cleaning, though never really a chore--Panasonic made it even simpler to clean.  </li>
            <li>It worked fine for a brief time when first purchased but is unserviceable now.</li>
            <li>my husband who is its main user and long-time beard grower:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have owned several hair and beard trimmers over the years and this is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>I will buy a different one next time but this one was the right price and had a lot of adjustment notches which is nice.</li>
            <li>The trimmer is very easy to use, very ergonomic like their shavers which I have been partial to for years.</li>
            <li>This works great, trims as expected, however be careful if you set the trim dial too low, you can trim more than you expect.  </li>
            <li>I originally purchased this item from a different company that guaranteed it for life and charged more than double the Amazon price plus shipping charges.</li>
            <li>It is very versatile, but if you&#x27;re one to keep some very detailed lines you need to be pretty careful with this.</li>
            <li>Quiet and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and has multiple adjustment settings (1 to 10 w/.5 incr.) to choose from.</li>
            <li>I took a chance buying this for my husband, since he&#x27;s very particular about how he shaves.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t remove guard, will not cut short hairs easily.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s an actual funnel where you run running water to get under the blade for easy cleaning, then you disassemble for sufficient aerating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s an actual funnel where you run running water to get under the blade for easy cleaning, then you disassemble for sufficient aerating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah</li>
            <li>Very quick and quiet.</li>
            <li>The clean-up with the Panasonic is easy as you simply hold it under a stream from your shower head.  </li>
            <li>The dial up length setting is easy to use and built to last.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Based on other reviews, I was excited to get the Panasonic as it looked like it would fit the bill and meet  </li>
            <li>You could easily go from beard to hair in just a second by rotating the rolling wheel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Super loud.  </li>
            <li>It looks cool, works great, can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li>Silent, strong, quality product.</li>
            <li>My beard might look a little short for the first couple of days, but I&#x27;m a happy guy.</li>
            <li>The adjustable guard will not let you trim defined lines which I feel is a large part of trimming.</li>
            <li>The large number of settings allows for any desired height.</li>
            <li>That is certainly an annoyance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>I always used one certain norelco trimmer, and then they stopped selling them.</li>
            <li>This model is certainly tuned toward a close trimmed beard.</li>
            <li>Wet dry feature makes it easy to use in shower and also easy to clean.</li>
            <li>They should have spent more time and money on functionality and REAL power versus making it look pretty.</li>
            <li>you want a well built, smooth running machine, go buy one right away; the strange design will either grow on you, or you will not care about it after you see how well the machine runs.</li>
            <li>you better oil it or it will loose rpm and will not cut as well.</li>
            <li>Works great wet or dry and never had it run out of power.  </li>
            <li>The adjustments are great and works well dry and wet.</li>
            <li>Works great wet or dry.</li>
            <li>Any shaver that can be used in water is a great shaver &amp; all mine are wet dry.</li>
            <li>Works well, cleans easy and is very ergonomic and quiet.  </li>
            <li>Adjusting the depth of cut is easy and cleaning is fast and simple.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend and the price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li>With the last trimmer I bought, it came with a whole bag full of different trimming head attachments, most of which were just used to change the length of hair it trimmed.</li>
            <li>so you can leave it on its dock full time other than that it&#x27;s fantastic</li>
            <li>actually like the comb, it feels fine against my face and doesn&#x27;t scratch.  </li>
            <li>And I just can&#x27;t describe what it&#x27;s like going from the retrospectively coarse trimming of the Wahl&#x27;s to this fine trimming machine.  </li>
            <li>And I just can&#x27;t describe what it&#x27;s like going from the retrospectively coarse trimming of the Wahl&#x27;s to this fine trimming machine.  </li>
            <li>First off, the build quality is better than any other trimmer I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li>So if you&#x27;re really particular about the exact length of your beard, then this one should give all the control</li>
            <li>The unit is waterproof so I can use it in the shower (a must for me) and is made of very high quality.  </li>
            <li>This is a very high quality razor.</li>
            <li>This little guy is amazing.</li>
            <li>I think the power is a little lacking and that could be a cause of catching hair as well.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used it I just set it high and worked my way to the setting that worked for me.  </li>
            <li>and it was a little more powerful for a faster haircut.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d expect any rechargeable device to tell me how much charge remains; either graphically or with a simple warning light, but this trimmer does not.</li>
            <li>and simple adjustments for a huge range of lengths.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quiet, fast and accurate.</li>
            <li>the dial to adjust the cut length&lt;br /&gt;No tug or pull&lt;br /&gt;Not to light that it feels cheap, but not to heavy that it is clunky</li>
            <li>Panasonic has a huge range of simple settings, to trim stubble or beards to any desired length.</li>
            <li>Really wanted to like this trimmer.  </li>
            <li>cuz it&#x27;s fast and cuts well.</li>
            <li>VERY SATISFIED.DOES</li>
            <li>However, the mechanism for attaching the clipper guard isn&#x27;t really durable.  </li>
            <li>Built in adjust ability is very convenient.</li>
            <li>[Pros] Only 1 Attachment for 19 adjustable settings (!!!), waterproof (!!!), ergonomic, powerful enough to not require too many swipes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But 95% of these complaints I&#x27;m seeing really aren&#x27;t legitimate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really?</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s able to be used WET.</li>
            <li>Too much work for you?</li>
            <li>So... let me get this straight</li>
            <li>So... let me get this straight</li>
            <li>I purchased this item for my husband and he absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li>No signs of rust, so it really is a stainless steel blade.</li>
            <li>It trims well and holds a charge very well.</li>
            <li>but no so much for hair.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this unit!</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>My husband has a mustache and beard that he keeps groomed very well.  </li>
            <li>Bought this for my husband and he really loves it.  </li>
            <li>Works really well.</li>
            <li>This does the job really well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve left it plugged in for hours and the light doesn&#x27;t come on, and</li>
            <li>the 1mm setting really works for my beard.  </li>
            <li>Very sturdy trimmer with lots of levels to choose from.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Wahl trimmers over the years because they simply were the ones that were available.</li>
            <li>Which at that point, the red light in front goes out and you are supposed to unplug the power cord from the wall.</li>
            <li>Well here I am, a week and a day after plugging it in and its still charging (red light is still on).</li>
            <li>I am really trying to like this razor; it will do the job, but I use this in conjunction with my Braun</li>
            <li>Really doesn&#x27;t trim hair all the well.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t line very well at all</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>WOW powerful tool</li>
            <li>Really fast shipping</li>
            <li>Hubby loves it and very versatile.</li>
            <li>The red light battery indicator is no longer on.</li>
            <li>PRO&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;- Stainless blades, just rinse off in the water, no rust&lt;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had a beard trimmer that hurts so much, haha.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Who makes a wet/dry shaver that requires that much oiling?  </li>
            <li>It really is a one pass trim.</li>
            <li>Light is just always on and same color when charging.</li>
            <li>This did not have much power and did not do the job.  </li>
            <li>I is hand and it has a quiet sound when it works, and the.</li>
            <li>The unit has a short trimming area (about an inch) which allows for precise trimming.  </li>
            <li>It is also very quiet and smooth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The comb/guard detaches if you want to trim something really close.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking to do haircuts, its also mighty enough to do that, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend doing yourself.</li>
            <li>and it died so we needed it replaced, he absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very well made.</li>
            <li>Works Very well.</li>
            <li>He really likes this one, and when (or if) it does die...</li>
            <li>I highly suggest this trimmer for anyone looking!</li>
            <li>It does a much faster job than this.</li>
            <li>works really well in water or out.  </li>
            <li>As a homosexual man it&#x27;s important to stay groomed, but this product is a definite no.</li>
            <li>It makes trimming by beard and mustache much easier</li>
            <li>I have used it twice and it cuts very well.</li>
            <li>It works really well.</li>
            <li>Body grooming performs as expected, but I&#x27;ve worked with better wired versions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My husband really likes this.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s lightweight and works very well in or out of the shower.</li>
            <li>If there this cheap with a $3 plastic part, I can only imagine what&#x27;s it like with a tv.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t really complain.</li>
            <li>This is a very well designed piece of equipment.  </li>
            <li>Really like the adjust-ability in the shave.</li>
            <li>My only disappointment with this product is that the charger light does not extinguish once charging is completed otherwise it is a wonderful product.</li>
            <li>Maybe I am expecting too much from a beard trimmer, but I feel like this product&#x27;s performance is sub-par.</li>
            <li>paid 1/2 as much as the price that I saw in a fancy shaving store</li>
            <li>this is ok but not really fast</li>
            <li>No matter how much oil I put on the blade,it seems to pinch a hair or two.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a bit worried about continued use, as I&#x27;m not too thorough with the whole oiling thing, but it hasn&#x27;t fallen apart on me yet.</li>
            <li>I really like this trimmer.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;There is no way to tell how much charge is in the battery of the clipper.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t trim very evenly and takes way longer than my Oster ever did.</li>
            <li>If they would update this product with a modern Li cell, would be 5 stars.</li>
            <li>This beard trimmer is even better than I expected.</li>
            <li>I really like the simplicity of the trim height selector.</li>
            <li>My only quibble is its somewhat cheap feel.</li>
            <li>The one thing I did not like about the stand is that is has this red light that comes on to indicate it is charging.  </li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>I EXPECTED MORE FOR THE PRICE.</li>
            <li>motor on this is very quite.  </li>
            <li>Cleaning it up couldn&#x27;t be easier, just run the whole thing under water.  </li>
            <li>This will not give you a completely smooth shave, but it will keep your facial hair neat and trimmed.</li>
            <li>Isn&#x27;t that all you really need to know?  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my husband for Christmas and he absolutely LOVES this.</li>
            <li>Does the trick (at 5mm) at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Love the fact it can get wet.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t expect to get much help.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Very unimpressed.</li>
            <li>all shavers, this one really, really needs a carrying case.  </li>
            <li>This trimmer works very well.</li>
            <li>He really likes it.</li>
            <li>I replaced a Wahl trimmer with this Panasonic and I am much happier with it.</li>
            <li>Real problem is the battery life.</li>
            <li>If you want to keep a very close beard/body hair this will work for you.</li>
            <li>If you are considering a trimmer this one works very well.</li>
            <li>Works really well.</li>
            <li>This is too much of a pain.</li>
            <li>Works really well.  </li>
            <li>This thing has a really low-quality blade that crushes hairs and splits them.</li>
            <li>but it was no worse for the wear.  </li>
            <li>By the end you really do just want it OVER as 45 minutes under the water makes you feel like a water mammal.</li>
            <li>He says that it shaves very close.  </li>
            <li>It is really a one-pass trimmer, thus saving time.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend, husband loves it!</li>
            <li>Finally a trimmer that doesn&#x27;t feel cheap...</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unfortunately, it does neither very well.  </li>
            <li>thing I really don&#x27;t like is the &amp;#34;stand&amp;#34; it doesn&#x27;t just plug in you need to get a stand out and charge it in a stand.</li>
            <li>For the reputation of the manufacturer and the cost of the device, I expected more.</li>
            <li>I really have no intention of using it in the shower</li>
            <li>He tells me repeatedly that  he really likes the trim settings and the control he has with the unit.  </li>
            <li>Now I really like this trimmer.  </li>
            <li>Very high-maintenance</li>
            <li>, way too much oiling</li>
            <li>It is really designed for closer cuts.  </li>
            <li>actually shaven smooth</li>
            <li>I also had to put oil on it very often.</li>
            <li>Really likt it.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to worry much about changing the blades all the time, also you can use it in the shower.</li>
            <li>Really.</li>
            <li>that would be a con except that I think it&#x27;s pretty normal for this style of cutter to need that.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>This trimmer works really well.</li>
            <li>The wet/dry feature is also very convenient and lets me wash the product easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s water proof and charges fast.</li>
            <li>I wish one can charge the trimmer while using it; otherwise, it&#x27;s very functional.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using it for a couple of weeks, but have found it to be quite comfortable in my hand.  </li>
            <li>This was really disappointing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Panasonic just confirmed that the battery life is only two years.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it for shaving (I use a razor blade for the areas I want to straight shave)</li>
            <li>I really like the adjustable comb, and the capability to use it in the shower.</li>
            <li>Also, it is very substantial with a sturdy grip.</li>
            <li>Having said that, it&#x27;s really up to you.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to have much power, and you are supposed to take it apart to oil it after every use.</li>
            <li>Seems very well made.</li>
            <li>so I really can&#x27;t compare it to anything else.  </li>
            <li>Really?)</li>
            <li>So don&#x27;t expect a fast job.</li>
            <li>Does the job very well.</li>
            <li>Although it has a lot of plastic parts it seams very reliable.</li>
            <li>Not helpful when you&#x27;re trying to get ready for work in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>I cannot comment on all the settings because I do not use them, but I am very heppy with it for how I use it.</li>
            <li>It really gets the job done.  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t found that it really has any impact on the performance of the shaver when this happens.</li>
            <li>Product is better than I expected.</li>
            <li>I really like the water port for cleaning.  </li>
            <li>I bought it not expecting to much</li>
            <li>Guess depends how much you use it.</li>
            <li>It takes too much space in the sink.</li>
            <li>Very well made..</li>
            <li>This shaver does have several shaving levels which is nice, especially for beard/sideburn trimming.</li>
            <li>My only critism is that it takes 24 hours to charge this thing when you first get it and 15 hours each full recharge afterward.</li>
            <li>trimmer completely solves that with its ingenious &#x27;dial a length&#x27; (my fancy technical term) built in guard.  </li>
            <li>The adjustable wheel is cool but takes some getting used to, I trimmed my beard way too short the first time.</li>
            <li>The best I could manage was to go really slowly and carefully - any speedy movements an</li>
            <li>partner has a plug in trimmer that doesn&#x27;t have any kind of guard or length attachments on it at all, and I&#x27;ve actually hurt myself on it multiple times.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, I would recommend a clipper like the Remington Titanium Precision Pro instead because it offers greater flexibility for different lengths of hair.  </li>
            <li>love the different levels this offers.</li>
            <li>Expect to spend quite a bit of time hitting the same spot over and over again until it actually gives you a nice even trim.</li>
            <li>So far, so good after using for a few months.</li>
            <li>Its portable, fits cofortably in your hand and is very accurate &amp; sharp.  </li>
            <li>Very precise adjustments and sharp blades.</li>
            <li>Very Well-made and very useful on all kinds of  trimming, especially beards and mustaches!</li>
            <li>is that it is not a smart battery system and chargerit could be so much better if it would turn itself off when charging was finished</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve now used this about 4 times and my wife says WOW!!!</li>
            <li>Surprised Panasonic did not slip a mini-radio in the handle???!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve paid a lot more for trimmers that were not nearly as good or as easy to use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a bit disappointed, but I guess I had overarching ideas of how quickly I could get a perfect &amp;#34;#6&amp;#34; throughout my face.</li>
            <li>I was fortunate enough to be able to purchase this during one of Amazon&#x27;s deal of the day and based on other reviews, I jumped in on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>which isn&#x27;t a major deal as I clean up with a normal razor w/ cream.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The trimmer charges quickly and the little charging station is easy to use and doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s always going to tip over like some brands</li>
            <li>I guess the old sayings right.</li>
            <li>Threw out my old one right away.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t speak to any other trimmers, but my son, whose beard can get very bushy but looks much better when it&#x27;s neatly trimmed, loves this trimmer.  </li>
            <li>Good enough to overlook the other two issues.</li>
            <li>This shaver is easily adjustable to varying lengths, but it&#x27;s not so easy that you&#x27;d accidentally adjust the length and lop off that hard earned beard.</li>
            <li>They cut cleanly, and don&#x27;t pull the hair out, and the dial is very cool, so you can make small adjustments.  </li>
            <li>First one was a very old panasonic one which used to always get stuck</li>
            <li>Worked fine for a week, now whirs around loudly and barely trims hair.</li>
            <li>I had to buy another buzzer I wouldn&#x27;t buy this one, but I&#x27;m not disappointed enough to go through the process of returning it.</li>
            <li>-- You do not have to oil this any more than any other trimmer, unless of course you are washing away the oil</li>
            <li>-- You do not have to oil this any more than any other trimmer, unless of course you are washing away the oil</li>
            <li>Most other body trimmers come with schlocky snap on plastic caps to adjust the closeness of the trim.  </li>
            <li>Pretty sure I&#x27;m going to lose that little brush in a week</li>
            <li>i also love the fact that the trimmer adjusts in 0.5 mm increments whereas other trimmers jump by 1.5 mm at some increments.</li>
            <li>I doubt other ones are much better.</li>
            <li>it costs a lil more than the other trimmers, bt</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and battery last a long time.</li>
            <li>Prefer the adjustment on this shaver over the yucky attachments that seemingly gets lost with most other shavers.</li>
            <li>I tried so many other ones with no luck.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know, because it shaves OK, as does every other product I try.</li>
            <li>Neither worked much better than the other.  </li>
            <li>But it works well every other time, and I am glad I got it.</li>
            <li>Panasonic has done the comb design much better than some other brands.  </li>
            <li>Great trimmer, not sure how much you &#x27;actually&#x27;  have to oil it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only had it for about a week, and I&#x27;ll update if anything significant happens.</li>
            <li>Upon receipt I observed that it is very lightweight, very modern, sleek and masculine looking.  </li>
            <li>It shaves decently, but I didn&#x27;t expect much to begin with.</li>
            <li>The only CON is that you have to take apart the blade assembly to clean and oil it.  </li>
            <li>the kind they sell on tv for getting the little hairs off your neck), actually does a better job at trimming my facial hairs.  </li>
            <li>Its light, powerful, quiet and does a great job cutting hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only had this for a few weeks but the trimmer works very well so far and the variable length settings are great.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product highly and it is reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>This is a very versatile, high quality trimmer that I have no problem giving the highest recommendation.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, does a good job of cutting the hairs uniformly, and the selector gives you a lot of options by the 1/2 mm.</li>
            <li>His facial hair grows SUPER FAST</li>
            <li>I really like the fact that this trimmer is quickly adjustable in 0.5mm steps without having to fool with different attachments.  </li>
            <li>The hair frees itself from the comb area pretty easily and washes down the drain.  </li>
            <li>to say though, the trimmer arrived pre charged and held that charge for a mighty long time...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Probably the only thing that really annoys me is that the indicator light on the charger doesn&#x27;t change when charging is complete.</li>
            <li>This wacko design is the only reason for which they are not getting the full 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Other than that, its a solid product and stands true to whatever it says on the description.</li>
            <li>I gave this to my 18 year old son to use for his first year in college during his \\&quot;No Shave</li>
            <li>The small blow out port or rinse out port is a nice feature.  </li>
            <li>It also works well doing a full pass from the back of my neck to my cheek and chin area.</li>
            <li>It holds a charge good for body not really good for face or precision.</li>
            <li>Cuts very well head hair but have not used it on facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;Charge is more than enough for a trim.</li>
            <li>I didnt care for this at 1st, but, after a few tries it grew on me and it actually does an excellent job</li>
            <li>None of my old ones would do that after the first month of use...</li>
            <li>So far this trimmer is pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s not really a complaint since it cuts really well.  </li>
            <li>It is quiet, solidly built and runs very smoothly.</li>
            <li>The only thing I miss from my old one is a pop up blade for fine trimming of sideburns, etc.</li>
            <li>So, most of the year, I &amp;#34;shave&amp;#34; from my jawline down with a trimmer.</li>
            <li>I have to make too many passes to cut my beard down to get an even look.</li>
            <li>This is much better than previous trimmers I&#x27;ve used because I would lose some of the trimmer heads.</li>
            <li>The trimmer was OK while it lasted, which was about half a year.&lt;br /&gt;Products may break, it happens, and this one supposedly has warranty.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>The fact that it can get wet assures cleaning is easy</li>
            <li>Works much better than the Wahl trimmer I had previously.</li>
            <li>This is just more of a slight inconvenience than anything.  </li>
            <li>This trimmer works much better for tidying up between haircuts on my son and husband that the previous trimmer I owned, which required changing attachments for each length.  </li>
            <li>Way better then my previous trimmer.</li>
            <li>His older groomer was wearing out and I found this on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Most trimmers require going over the same spots multiple times, but not this one.</li>
            <li>How many clippers can you take in the shower and use on a daily basis that last like this?</li>
            <li>I thought that I did not want to go above 3 MM&#x27;s , but luckily I tried it at 3 MM&#x27;s just to try it</li>
            <li>I had the older version of this for years.  </li>
            <li>actually i have tried many different razor shavers</li>
            <li>Holds a decent charge.</li>
            <li>I used a different brand of shaver for several years... that worked, but the Panasonic Milano shaver is much better.  </li>
            <li>(i have 4mm shaved sides) and it works great for my thick asian hair.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li>I love that this shaver has multiple settings such as 2.0, 2.5 length for those days</li>
            <li>--I have a fairly coarse beard and mustache and it takes many passes to even out my beard, and I still touch up with scissors after spending a solid 10-15 minutes using the trimmer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve traveled with it for up to a week without the charger, using it for a very short time every day, so it seems to hold an adequate charge for my needs.</li>
            <li>Dont get a razor straight line when trimming  my moustache,my old Norelco was much better,wish they still made it.</li>
            <li>This trimmer can be used in the shower, which might be a plus for some, but the main plus for me is that it does what it is supposed to.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many different brands of low cost trimmers.  </li>
            <li>Feels like it was made with care, using decent parts.</li>
            <li>The 3rd time I opened it for cleaning and oiling, 2 tiny metal pieces that somehow hold the top  razor plate in place, popped out and fell on the counter.  </li>
            <li>I replaced an older Norelco that did EVERTHING</li>
            <li>I have moderately thick/stiff facial hair and even without the guard the trimmer often struggles and takes way too many passes to cut everything</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re trying to trim a specific pattern in your facial hair, a cordless model like this one would give you a lot more</li>
            <li>* Decent price&lt;br /</li>
            <li>For the most part, all the extra features (comb attachments, easy to clean with water, etc.) are irrelevant to me, and I&#x27;ve yet to really test them out.  </li>
            <li>I use this trimmer mainly for my moustache and goatee.  </li>
            <li>i think it would have been pretty easy to make a little slot on the charging station to store the brush.</li>
            <li>Extremely well made, the trimming level set by mm ensures that I can quickly trim my &#x27;stache and &#x27;burns at the right level every day in a jiff.</li>
            <li>I use it several times each week and get a very consistent result.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to spend this much money on an electric shaver,  I figured they were all pretty much the same</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is very easy to use, fast to adjust, and easy to clean (just rinse the cutting blades in the sink for 10 seconds, wipe off, and put a drop of oil back on the blades).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li>Like a couple of other reviewers I also believe the motor could be a little more powerful too, but it cuts through my dry beard just fine, so maybe the motor is just right.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for trimming body hair.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>The price point is high; I&#x27;m no mustache expert</li>
            <li>After doing a lot of research I saw this one to be highly recommended.  </li>
            <li>I highly recomend</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommend it.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It can be precisely dialed to your chosen length, doesn&#x27;t need to pass over the face 200 times to get all the hairs (though multiple passes are necessary if you&#x27;re in the very low settings), and it navigates smoothly around my mustache.  </li>
            <li>Thus I had high hopes for this trimmer.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li>But all that said, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>highly recommend it</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend if your in the market for an electric trimmer.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>This product has a very nice design but if you have a thick beard, look elsewhere such as the discontinued Panasonic ER224S All-in-One Hair Clipper &amp; Beard Wet/Dry Trimmer.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>If I were still single and needed a quick groom before regular dates with hotties this would be a significant downside of</li>
            <li>If it was a friends trimmer, cool, but one that I expected to be brand new (unused) is pretty nasty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Available in reasonable price compared to other product.</li>
            <li>It does not function smoothly and it is hard to disassemble to clean.  </li>
            <li>It is relatively quiet and cuts fast, and with the adjustable head height it is easy to trim body hair in different areas.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The shaver feels very well made and the wet / dry feature is nice.  </li>
            <li>not user friendly;  beard trimming occurs in a direction opposite to the direction of hairs in beard; does not feet a natural way of trimming.</li>
            <li>very sharp and easy on the face, not irritating.</li>
            <li>I wound up with little more than 5 o&#x27;clock shadow.</li>
            <li>All it needs is a little rinse afterwards and most all of the beard trimmings are gone.</li>
            <li>If you are trimming mostly beard and a little mustache</li>
            <li>but I prefer something a little more substantial.  </li>
            <li>I found the 4050 to have a little more power, which means the 4070 which is also cheaper then this</li>
            <li>I love everything about this razor, but I wish it was a little wider.</li>
            <li>I was trying to pull off the guard to use the bare clippers to do some fine trimming and the 2 white plastic arms that hold it in place broke.</li>
            <li>On the other hand, now the comb slides off easily but still stays put while I&#x27;m trimming, so this hasn&#x27;t been an issue</li>
            <li>For a product that has such a good design and fine adjustment features, this completely fails in three ways.</li>
            <li>easy to use, no clogging and still sharp.  </li>
            <li>The ergonomic design makes it easy to hold for maximum control.&lt;br /&gt;The trim control comb is rounded so as not to gouge or grab the skin like some of the other ones I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m so delighted with this trimmer, because while it doesn&#x27;t come with any accessories, it has a little wheel you can spin that sets the trim length anywhere from 1 to 10 mm long, so it&#x27;s not a fussy process to adjust the hair length.</li>
            <li>It gives a decent shave &amp; trim, and it with 19 individual settings, it&#x27;s just a matter of finding the right one for your needs.</li>
            <li>I would buy again without hesitation, battery life is reasonable and so far product has performed well after some use.</li>
            <li>Works great for the price, however it is bit difficult when cleaning.</li>
            <li>Wow is the trimmer well built and works very well.  </li>
            <li>Yes I&#x27;m cheap &amp; haven&#x27;t spent a lot on trimmers</li>
            <li>She remarked, \\&quot;wow, this thing doesn&#x27;t cut very well does it?\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>You can use this for normal haircuts and also as a beard trimmer.  </li>
            <li>Star rated device.as you normally would.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s not a complaint).  </li>
            <li>He doesn&#x27;t usually remark on products but stopped me just to say how much he loved it, especially the built in levels.</li>
            <li>/&gt;only drawback is that it&#x27;s not quite powerful enough...</li>
            <li>This is much better than my Norelco whose plastic groves broke after a few months of use.</li>
            <li>Need a few more words.</li>
            <li>Considering most electric razors and trimmers adapt to various currents around the world this is indeed a strange situation to find myself in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li>My old Phillips 20 dollar model was finally on its last legs, so I decided to upgrade to a better model.  </li>
            <li>It has a normal charge hold/cycle.  </li>
            <li>A dial to select how short you want to trim and an on/off button, and that&#x27;s pretty much it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used it in conjunction with a normal hair comb on my buddy and it worked well.</li>
            <li>The look of it is so modern on the bathroom counter that it is consistent with a 21st century life upgrade.</li>
            <li>I dont know if panasonic is paying this magazine because the trimmer isnt much better than an inexpensive one i bought at k mart a few years ago.  </li>
            <li>Because of my success with this I have now ordered the big brother (Panasonic ER-GS60-S Self-Hair Clipper Wet/Dry).</li>
            <li>One swipe is all it takes to trim correctly, no more raking the trimmer back and forth to get a good trim.</li>
            <li>Tried taping it and supergluing it and got a few more uses</li>
            <li>Quiet powerful wet/dry clippers.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased so many over the years and this one falls somewhere in mediocrity.</li>
            <li>Walked around with a bare strip on my beard after using it the first time.  </li>
            <li>The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because the trimmer isn&#x27;t as powerful as I would prefer (I would attribute this to the fact that it&#x27;s waterproof - some power is sacrificed for that flexibility).</li>
            <li>Plenty powerful enough for trimming my goatee.</li>
            <li>Has many different lengths, hard to find the right one at first.</li>
            <li>moreover, i don&#x27;t have to shave with as many passes, which cuts down my shaving time considerably.</li>
            <li>just make sure its dry before recharging it obviously.</li>
            <li>I especially appreciate being able to do this task in the shower as it literally washes the trimmings away, no pesky dry cleanup around the bathroom sink.</li>
            <li>The motor is strong enough to where it actually cuts the hair and not just pull it out etc.</li>
            <li>but if you raise the guard high enough you&#x27;re likely fine if you can pull the skin tawt.  </li>
            <li>Zero complaints with this trimmer, keeps my facial hair (goatee) trimmed just right.</li>
            <li>, looks like a solid product, and performs right on target.</li>
            <li>You need to pull it off in order to do close clipping and then get it into the right slots to put it back in.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth the higher price compared to other brands.</li>
            <li>Charging is quick and it holds a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li>Not as sharp and powerful as I would like, but the settings allow me to get the exact look I want.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not very travel friendly.  </li>
            <li>Also wish that the light changed from red to green (or something) to indicate that it has reached a full charge.</li>
            <li>Fortunately for me, this is the length I typically trim my beard, but does not allow for me to keep my beard neat if I want to go a little more mountain</li>
            <li>and they&#x27;re sending me a new one for $10.00 (includes shipping).  </li>
            <li>so now i am looking for a new trimmer.</li>
            <li>It still works like new and is my go to travel clippers.</li>
            <li>I made a mistake with the Panasonic and am ordering a new Wahl Groomsman.</li>
            <li>about as they live in N.C.,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to be looking for a new trimmer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s under-powered and doesn&#x27;t even live up to the trimmer (brand)</li>
            <li>I had been thinking about getting a new trimmer to replace an ancient one of mine and</li>
            <li>I bought this shaver brand new for $49.</li>
            <li>I will put a new review after having the product a couple of months.</li>
            <li>I found new jobs for it after I started using it.</li>
            <li>I found new jobs for it after I started using it.</li>
            <li>even when it was new when compared to this one.</li>
            <li>- I&#x27;ll live with that.  </li>
            <li>I live in Toronto, Canada.  </li>
            <li>and maybe get a new one.</li>
            <li>new rating for this shaver is:  *</li>
            <li>I checked the price of a new set of blades to have a spare set and found them to be $20.</li>
            <li>I get a new trimmer every couple of years.</li>
            <li>The clippers cut like they were new again.  </li>
            <li>Oiling and cleaning are very easy and hardly takes any time.</li>
            <li>though never really a chore--Panasonic made it even simpler to clean.  </li>
            <li>He used it immediately and loves how accurate and especially how quiet it is.</li>
            <li>I needed a trimmer than can get wet when need be and remain rust-free and clean.</li>
            <li>My beard was pretty long (much longer than 10mm), and it took a couple passes to get rid of all the stragglers.  </li>
            <li>Cuts hair so fast you definitely don&#x27;t want to trim too fast around the neckline with this monster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Holds a charge for a long time, but takes to long to charge up if needed quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Seems to be built well and hope it holds up for many years.</li>
            <li>The light on the stand only indicates that charger is actually on the stand correctly.  </li>
            <li>The light is only red, it will not change colors when it is done charging, nor will it turn</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know of its a power issue or if the head design is just not as effective, but the performance is seriously sub par.</li>
            <li>The narrow clipper now gets into tighter areas around the mouth and sideburns, and really trims the mustache precisely.</li>
            <li>Glad I spent the extra money to buy this.</li>
            <li>Unless you are trying to cultivate some serious beard artistry on your face this trimmer will do the trick nicely.</li>
            <li>spent OVER 45 minutes in the shower doing \\&quot;body grooming\\&quot; (no goose neck or eggs) and even with MANY passes in all different directions</li>
            <li>Just hold it an extra second and it stays on all by itself allowing for free maneuverability.</li>
            <li>The multiple settings are fantastic for beard and facial hair trimming</li>
            <li>The Remington comes with a collection of combs which allows for a much greater range of cutting heights, has better ergonomics and does not require oiling after each use.</li>
            <li>The removable head is now broken because of the cheap plastic tabs that secure it to the shaver head.  </li>
            <li>Its a few years old but does a better job than this one.</li>
            <li>Turned out to be pretty much exactly what I expected after reading the description and reviews.  </li>
            <li>very quiet, although I don&#x27;t oil it as much as it wants, and it holds the charge very good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The unit has a turn dial for how long you want the hair, which is nice, you can also remove it to trim it down to nothing.  </li>
            <li>I am plagued/gifted with very fast growing facial hair, so I wonder why I never went this route before.  </li>
            <li>Remember to oil it very frequently or</li>
            <li>Husband has very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended and the seller was by far cheaper than any retail store.</li>
            <li>I prefer beard trimmers to cut my hair (I cut it short) and this one has a fine blade that cuts closer than my Norelco did, is quiet to use, and the ergonomic design pleasantly surprised me.  </li>
            <li>Love this - works well, I mean really well.</li>
            <li>Thought it was great until a small black plastic piece came off and now it hurts to use.  </li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Well this is my first adventure into a shaver that actually allows you to keep your  beard.  </li>
            <li>Have purchased many beard trimmers in the past.  </li>
            <li>The angle of the cutter is such that you have to hold it more parallel to your face to get a short cut.</li>
            <li>Finally found a real trimmer!</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>(I normally shave my head completely).</li>
            <li>but I tolerated it... until the battery completely died on me 6 months after buying it!</li>
            <li>These are pretty basic flaws.</li>
            <li>is a pretty solid 4-star shaver for hair/beard/</li>
            <li>I think this is pretty standard for body shaving.  </li>
            <li>It takes many passes on my stubble to get it short enough, and it&#x27;s the same on my beard when using the trimmer guard.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s pretty solid.</li>
            <li>I needed a trimmer that could do a consistent job, and let me figure out the initial length.</li>
            <li>Also a comb attachment which can be dialed up to 10mm.&lt;br /&gt;+My favourite quality about this product is that it is much more quiet than other trimmers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money!</li>
            <li>For some reason it doesn&#x27;t get all the hairs the first, nor second time.</li>
            <li>But for facial hair maintenance, the wet/dry thing is pretty much a meaningless gimmick; you&#x27;ll pluck as many hairs as you trim if trying to touch-up a wet beard, and rinsing longer stubble off the blades wont be as effective as just brushing them off.  </li>
            <li>Sure, other facial trimmers have adjustable combs, but they&#x27;re often flimsy and interfere with the hair making contact with the blades.  </li>
            <li>Its cool to use wet</li>
            <li>I kept it plugged in for the first few days, but then I decided to see how long the battery will last on its own.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Ergonomics is good though I do have to press the small button a couple of times to turn it on, only because that button is too dang small to fit my fingertip into.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I still prefer using a guard, because it looks absolutely ridiculous if you scalp one portion of your beard, and I&#x27;d rather take a little more time over the process and know that it&#x27;s going to look okay</li>
            <li>This is a new version of my husbands old trimmer</li>
            <li>These trimmers are well constructed, works wet or dry and provides very precise grooming.</li>
            <li>Comes with long lasting battery, has comfortable settings, and a close trim.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I had previously used a Wahl professional-style corded hair trimmer to trim my beard, so I freely admit this could be coloring my expectations.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Seems blades could be available for less.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical at first, but this really is a nice hair and beard trimmer.  </li>
            <li>I trimmed my beard far to short the first time...</li>
            <li>Look cool and works great!.&lt;br /&gt;Hoping it will last as lone as the last one?.</li>
            <li>I was a little tentative at first when I took it into the shower with me, but it works even better than I expected.  </li>
            <li>This trimmer, while lacking things such as a nose trimmer and &amp;#34;shaver&amp;#34;, is a much better tool and takes my beard length down to a millimeter or so without the spacer blade.  </li>
            <li>I love the adjustability of it down to 1/2 millimeters by the simple use of a spinning wheel.</li>
            <li>I think it might work ok for trimming longer beards down to short lengths, but if your goal is to maintain a 1-2mm &amp;#34;haven&#x27;t shaved in 4 days&amp;#34; length, look elsewhere.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just be ready to go over the same area a few times, and keep those blades clean!</li>
            <li>On this second attempt I used Dove Body Wash on a section of my body at a time (i.e. chest, left arm, right arm, left leg, right leg etc.)</li>
            <li>This was my second purchase of same product from amazon, i was really amazed by the first one, but this time Blades of the trimmer hurts.</li>
            <li>It works pretty well, takes a few minutes and a few passes and does a nice job.</li>
            <li>its so weak because the rest of the design is nice.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, you still need a second trimmer that gives a very close shave for neatening up the edges of the hairline, it would be absolutely fantastic if it could dial down to \\&quot;zero\\&quot; rather than 1mm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I love the ability to use it wet... or dry.  </li>
            <li>Gotta love the wet or dry cleaning too.</li>
            <li>Often left with a much more ragged shave than my previous shaver.</li>
            <li>As a result, I had to do dry shaving outside of the shower and even that didn&#x27;t go smoothly (so-to-speak).  </li>
            <li>, I like the charging station, but when it comes to functionality, falls short, can&#x27;t really leave nice, uniform, short beard, can&#x27;t use it to set the beard line, also it is not as smooth as other brands when trimming parts with thick hair..</li>
            <li>And his ability to put it back in the original packaging without having the courtesy to at least clean it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I couldn&#x27;t find an adjustable comb replacement, no information about any particular part number or the like (which Panasonic intuitively addresses this by providing replacement part numbers for nearly all the major components of the Milano trimmer in their documentation).  </li>
            <li>This has worked fantastic years later, I have yet to have a single issue.</li>
            <li>Lots of people have posted about the battery issues and while I know there are lots of positive reviews, I strongly rec that everyone take the battery issues seriously.</li>
            <li>The 19 Setting Single Attachment: Anyone who really maintains facial hair understands how crucial fine length-settings are.</li>
            <li>so he uses it pretty much every day or every other day.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, to charge it, it&#x27;s not a simple, plug in this cord and lay it on the counter, it&#x27;s this large plastic contraption that grips the shaver at the sides to charge it.  </li>
            <li>The BLADE isn&#x27;t sharp and thus barely cuts hairs and misses many so you have to hit them 12 times in all different directions</li>
            <li>I do wish it went a little higher than 10 mm, though that is pretty long.&lt;br</li>
            <li>great product for cutting unwanted hair.</li>
            <li>Does a great job at cutting hair on head and on neck.  </li>
            <li>It States Clearly In The Instructions...</li>
            <li>and I assume there use to be a clear plastic sticker or something on the bottom seal</li>
            <li>Otherwise a great trimmer, solid build and has survived quite a few falls and heavy use.</li>
            <li>These do not cut nearly as well as they are touted.</li>
            <li>This trimmer is nowhere near as efficient as those in a barbershop.</li>
            <li>Got this for my boyfriend for his birthday just as his old trimmer died.</li>
            <li>Decided to try this one when the battery died on my old one.</li>
            <li>: It&#x27;s too much to ask that this hand-held, waterproof, compact beard-cutting machine be charged for a day once a week. ... ... ... ...</li>
            <li>: It&#x27;s too much to ask that this hand-held, waterproof, compact beard-cutting machine be charged for a day once a week. ... ... ... ...</li>
            <li>I use it in the shower and rise it directly under water and so far not problems.</li>
            <li>I purchased this as a gift and so far my husband has no complaints.</li>
            <li>Much easier to use than his last brand.</li>
            <li>My old Panasonic gave up and died</li>
            <li>This was a Christmas gift for my adult son.  </li>
            <li>Very well put together totally quality.</li>
            <li>really wanted to like this unit, but life is too short.</li>
            <li>I had an old battery operated Norelco for a decade, this this blows it out of the water.</li>
            <li>, as is the case with my old Wahl model.  </li>
            <li>Now the instructions say it will take 15 to 20 hours to charge up completely.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it 3 times now and each time I have had to completely buzz off my beard since this machine did</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t really notice anything off until I started looking at the dial where you can turn for a different length.</li>
            <li>stars for the fact that I am probably the only people for being graced with a gently used trimmer.</li>
            <li>I have 5 o&#x27;clock shadow and it doens&#x27;t work very well for my short haired beard.</li>
            <li>I bought this shaver for my 25 year old son for Christmas.</li>
            <li>I have never received a complete explanation for this yo yo series of transactions.  </li>
            <li>It is completely waterproof so you can do this in the shower, rinse it under your faucet in your sink etc.</li>
            <li>I know some people have a complaint about this machine but as a man who is VERY picky about keeping his beard short and blended, I love it.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t perform as well as my old trimmer.  </li>
            <li>The reciprocating blade doesn&#x27;t align with the fixed cutter head.</li>
            <li>The settings are clearly marked.  </li>
            <li>and the product is not even 30 days old.</li>
            <li>The battery requires 18 hours for complete charge.</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace my husband&#x27;s old trimmer.</li>
            <li>Works really well and would definitely buy again!</li>
            <li>So far I like this product.</li>
            <li>I gave up, I got out my 10 year old, busted Remington hair trimmer and finished the job in 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>over the years, i have purchased various trimmers from different brands and for the most part it has been different product, same result.</li>
            <li>i prefer my old Norelco Acuvac over this one.</li>
            <li>so far may never try others again?</li>
            <li>no worries so far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone over a week without charging even though I use it nearly every day.</li>
            <li>This Panasonic doesn&#x27;t have near the power.</li>
            <li>I like my 8 year old remmington.</li>
            <li>Decided to &amp;#34;splurge&amp;#34; on this instead of fixing the old one.  </li>
            <li>with the grain for smoothing and wild hair removal.</li>
            <li>I like my old one</li>
            <li>I can take the guard off completely for trimming my head hair if I don&#x27;t feel like using a razor on it</li>
            <li>It holds a charge for a long time and cuts consistently.  </li>
            <li>Completely unsatisfactory.</li>
            <li>However I nearly dislocated my thumb trying to slide this off</li>
            <li>This lets me do my head and face to a Number#1 all over in five minutes - even if I have let things get a bit wild.  </li>
            <li>would give it 5 stars if it were not for the frequent lubrication requirement.</li>
            <li>I recommend it for anyone who has to shave their head frequently.</li>
            <li>but they performed similarly although the Wahls did outperform those, not by much though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It taught me that 6 mm is not #4 length on an old fashioned shaver/hair cutter.</li>
            <li>I use it weekly and have had no problems with it so far.</li>
            <li>but the performance of the item so far is</li>
            <li>I went with the lowest setting and that achieved a nearly \\&quot;hairless look\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>hello, i was surprised when it&#x27;sburned out  after one week.</li>
            <li>Many complained about having to oil it after each use.</li>
            <li>; I thought I had it set at 10mm (when in fact it was set at 1mm) and inadvertently chopped off a big chunk of whiskers I had really planned to keep.  </li>
            <li>it replaces a 14 year old Remington that the battery pack died on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>after using this trimmer for several months now, I&#x27;ve really grown attached to it.  </li>
            <li>far as the trimming is concerned, the Panasonic trimmer works well</li>
            <li>This results in the trimmer yanking out hair and, eventually, completely dying.</li>
            <li>the light would turn green when it was done charging</li>
            <li>Used for 3 weeks so far.</li>
            <li>We tried to use it to cut my 3 year old sons hair and it didn&#x27;t make a dent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned lots of beard trimmers, and they just really aren&#x27;t built to last.</li>
            <li>It offers me the added convenience of being used without the cumbersome electrical cord.  </li>
            <li>Purchased this trimmer because my old trimmer would not hold a charge.</li>
            <li>Comfortable to hold and not too heavy.  </li>
            <li>I bought this as a gift for my 20 year old son who loves his beard.</li>
            <li>The trouble only increases when that beard is more like a 7 o&#x27;clock shadow.  </li>
            <li>guess it&#x27;s worth the roughly $45</li>
            <li>battery doesn&#x27;t run long enough to trim a full beard on one charge, either.</li>
            <li>One of the more expensive beard trimmers but well worth the investment.</li>
            <li>The trimmer has 19 different settings which means I can have 1 mm worth of beard that gives me that stubble look or I can grow my beard out and then trim it back to 10 mm which gives me the  Ulysses S. Grant look.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t quite have a sense for how long the full charge takes, but I&#x27;ve had no issues getting plenty of juice for my extensive trimming job when I need it.</li>
            <li>I rarely use this to trim wet hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It might work for someone who just has the occasional couple of days worth of stubble to trim, or someone who likes to keep their goatee really short.</li>
            <li>Due to the tiredness and exhaustion of being a relatively new father; coinciding with the &amp;#34;lumbersexual&amp;#34; look in vogue right now; I&#x27;ve grown a beard.</li>
            <li>But that does not deduct from its rating, as most trimmers are not wide enough in less you buy professional barber shears.</li>
            <li>with any trimmer, the downside is keeping the device clean.&lt;br /&gt;Charging the device as been easy with a long battery life lasting 5 days of daily, once a day use for head and beard trimming.</li>
            <li>I made the mistake of starting at the lowest comb setting and plowing right up the middle of my chin.</li>
            <li>I have used several other cheaper beard trimmers and the guard would give an uneven cut, this one is smooth and accurate</li>
            <li>The one downside to it is that any trimmer with a guard trims just a little bit less quickly and accurately than one without.</li>
            <li>Those usually don&#x27;t work well and are easy to lose over time.  </li>
            <li>In particular I really like the &amp;#34;Dial a length&amp;#34; adjustment that no longer needs mounting and installing different combs for different areas of my beard.</li>
            <li>body is small and lightweight and easy to hold.  </li>
            <li>I have gone through a few other trimmers with a kind of &amp;#34;meh&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I fried the charger overseas and the price for a new shaver and charger was about the same as a new charger.</li>
            <li>Need a new charger already, only charged it twice, and now after the 30 day warranty, have to get a new one, for $32...</li>
            <li>/&gt;It comes with a little brush to clean it - but no place to put the brush.</li>
            <li>Powerful and sharp.  </li>
            <li>so it has to be cleaned after every other pass, and even then, it&#x27;s not cutting</li>
            <li>I have another Panasonic razor and it felt the same new last year and now has battery issues and seems ready to fall apart, so</li>
            <li>Hahahaha more expensive than buying brand new.  </li>
            <li>Being able to use it wet or dry is a big plus.</li>
            <li>I have had this product for about 2 years and every so ofter I have to clean it out and lube a few part as directed in the owners manual.  </li>
            <li>The trimmer is not well balanced and this coupled with the lightweight feel led to the feeling that it is more of a toy than a serious trimmer.</li>
            <li>I clean and oil them every few uses</li>
            <li>The depth adjustment is clever, but doesn&#x27;t cut as evenly as the Wahl, which has several guides to attach separately.</li>
            <li>After about an hour of going over the same small spots 20 times or more, I gave up.</li>
            <li>Barely cuts my beard, requires multiple passes, clogs in one pass even though it missed so much.</li>
            <li>Small, Quiet, Light, ergonomic and packs a punch!</li>
            <li>Would be better with a wider cutting area, but overall a strong shaver.</li>
            <li>My trimming time has been cut in half, as this trimmer is actually able to cut the hairs in a single pass (Imagine That!).  </li>
            <li>This was a major upgrade over my old trimmer.</li>
            <li>The cheap ones will cut and snag painfully, but this is smooth, quiet, powerful, and does not snag and cut.  </li>
            <li>On the plus side, this trimmer appears to be very solidly built and of high quality.  </li>
            <li>had really high hopes for this thing, but it just couldn&#x27;t compete with the last trimmer I had.</li>
            <li>the charge last a long time, simple to clean...</li>
            <li>main problem, though, is that the battery didn&#x27;t even last a year before it got to the point where the trimmer would go from a full charge to completely dead in about 45 seconds.</li>
            <li>Feels solid and makes little noise&lt;br /&gt;Built in dial to adjust trimming length is much better than multiple replaceable guards</li>
            <li>No down side.</li>
            <li>Wet Dry feature is fantastic and I have purchased 3 of them for gifts for my friends.</li>
            <li>If there are durability issues, I will re-post, but for now, there are no down sides to this trimmer.</li>
            <li>After a few weeks, using it once or twice a week, the initial charge is still going strong.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend it to others, I do not have a super thick beard but it handles the hair I have very well, both trim and edging</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d expect that red light to either shut off or turn green when the charge is complete, but it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>It holds a charge for a long time, and the stand is really convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone through about four in the past two years that were cheap and among them were Remington in the norelco entry level trimmers</li>
            <li>But, with the exception of a few trimmers, which I felt were of lesser quality, most of them were of similar design.  </li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t use it in the shower with the guard on to do your normal trimming of your entire beard.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got a thick, coarse beard, and I enjoy how this trimmer really lets me customize how close I want my hair.</li>
            <li>Using the trimmer in wet conditions is exactly as desirable as mowing your lawn in the rain.</li>
            <li>Very quiet, the charging cradle doesn&#x27;t take up too much room in my small bathroom, and the submersible and washable design is just way too cool.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected</li>
            <li>Perhaps they&#x27;re useful for someone with an extremely dense beards, but it barely worked for me.</li>
            <li>It died in the middle of me trimming my beard before work after vacation- hilarious but it really is just a piss poor shaver.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice that it can handle being wet and the base is nice for automatic recharging.  </li>
            <li>Nothing to swap out between lengths, and a quick change if I want it a little shorter.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an amount which will likely only by noticed by your female friend but given how much time I spent I expected better</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since this is made to work wet or dry though, I&#x27;m not really surprised that it can&#x27;t be plugged in since I doubt they want someone doing something foolish like stepping into the shower holding something plugged into an outlet :)</li>
            <li>The fact that this is both wet and dry is unique.</li>
            <li>But it may have just been hard to tell because the charge indicator light quit working completely after a couple of months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And instead of experimenting with different adjustable combs that might fit--I just decided to get a new beard trimmer, but not before doing a bit of research.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Their default advice is to buy a new one which with shipping is more expensive than buying a new machine from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I lost it and it cost me the same as a new trimmer to replace it.</li>
            <li>is more powerful and has a dial setting that comes off for close cutting.</li>
            <li>Surprised at how quiet it is compared to my old Norelco trimmer.</li>
            <li>Even on a beard that&#x27;s less than fun.</li>
            <li>The only downside about this product is the long charge time (first time charge is 36 hours).</li>
            <li>The length adjustment is simple and straight forward despite not having a truly short setting.</li>
            <li>Really like the adjustment configuration, wont slip to different length in the middle of trimming your beard.  </li>
            <li>The motor isn&#x27;t nearly as powerful as on the Wahl 9854-600 trimmer that I previously used until its battery died.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Definitely would recommend this product to anyone that consistently keeps their beard groomed - long or short.</li>
            <li>I am learning to use this daily as my only shaveng tool and its working, this is the real deal</li>
            <li>I know that things aren&#x27;t built to last any more, but you figure it&#x27;ll work for at least two years,</li>
            <li>I saw so much blood in the last several months</li>
            <li>would like it if the charging light could switch from red to green when it&#x27;s fully charged, but mine just doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Which means if the battery goes dead and you want to use it really quickly, you have to wait for it to charge up a bit before you can use</li>
            <li>I keep a consistent beard and my hair gets pretty thick.  </li>
            <li>I imagine someone with very coarse thick hair may have more issues than I&#x27;ve had given the not-so-powerful motor on this unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Being able to use it in the shower means no sink full of hair and the charging base is smartly designed.  </li>
            <li>Spend just a little more and get something that will last a long time and work well during that time.</li>
            <li>Even after charging for a whole day, the charge does not hold even for a single shave.</li>
            <li>This trimmer cuts like no other trimmer I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li>Sharp blades cut hair the first time, no need to keep going over an area again.</li>
            <li>It has been a major headache.  </li>
            <li>like all other clippers of this variety that I am aware of, it requires you to oil it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
            <li>Major downside is having to charge this for 24h to get 1h of usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use them to trim facial hair and even to get a close shave on my head and by simply applying a little bit of the oil that came with them, they continue to go strong.</li>
            <li>Overall good trimmer, but very poor description.</li>
            <li>This item is selling for $69 right now on Amazon, but you can get it for $20 less both online and in stores.</li>
            <li>My old Panasonic trimmer finally died on me, which by the way served me well for years and years, so I decided to go with their new facial</li>
            <li>Not really feeling this clipper,it works better when my goatee is wet then dry.</li>
            <li>Love the adjustable dial,  Works in the shower, wish the cutting teeth were wider takes more passes to shave my head with this trimmer than with my previous trimmer.</li>
            <li>Once the hair gets wet (and we&#x27;re only talking about a half inch of hair at the most)</li>
            <li>It must be the large and wide comb head that lets it get closer in the contours of your face.</li>
            <li>was at first concerned that the rolling length selector would change while holding the trimmer in an awkward or offhand position, but I can say that the selection has a very secure click to lock into each length.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The wet feature and easy clean makes it pretty versitile, but alas where this trimmer falls short (along with every trimmer minus Philips Norelco) is the vacuum feature.</li>
            <li>While they may work, it just takes too long compared to a high powered corded model.</li>
            <li>Sure, one can do that in the shower and have virtually no clean up...as long as one is prepared to take an hour long shower to trim any beard that is longer than the shortest settings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice, because I&#x27;m always getting to try the \\&quot;latest and greatest\\&quot;, bad because I have to invest another $50 every few years.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is one of the poorer shavers I have used, does not cut evenly, takes  a really long time to trim my beard, doesn&#x27;t really work that well on coarse</li>
            <li>Beard trimmings sticking to the rubber handle and can&#x27;t be brushed off (an old pet-peeve of mine).</li>
            <li>I had and old panasonic trimmer that finally died.</li>
            <li>has the power to trim even the wildest beards yet has NEVER even grabbed a hair and yanked it out, especially when you&#x27;re trimming up &#x27;sensitive&#x27; areas - you know, like your neck and Adam&#x27;s apple areas.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m back to my 18 year old beard trimmer.</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;Not really what I expected.  </li>
            <li>Only had it for about a months, but so far no issues.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend&#x27;s old trimmer finally died, and he insisted that he was just going to start shaving.</li>
            <li>Pulled hairs and actually nicked sensitive areas when using the shaver with no attachments.</li>
            <li>Only drawback is prior to first use you need to charge it for a LONG time.  </li>
            <li>My old Philips Norelco beard trimmer finally died after years of use</li>
            <li>the once mighty Braun now makes stuff that feels like this, so I guess real solid build quality just doesn&#x27;t provide the repeat business of products designed to last a few years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A #6 setting on my old Norelco is not the same as a #6 on the Panasonic.</li>
            <li>I have noticed however that the charger light indicator stays red and does not turn to Green at any point which I can only assume</li>
            <li>Overall I would still recommend this to anyone  as far as Beard/hair trimmers go.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It gets two stars because it does work, but barely.</li>
            <li>While both have a built-in length adjustment, this Panasonic trimmer seems to be much safer, allowing a much faster shave at the same length setting along uneven terrain.</li>
            <li>I can barely trim my face before it peters out each morning.</li>
            <li>I use the waterproof feature frequently and rinse it daily.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went back to my old Conair iStubble.</li>
            <li>so I can keep up with my buzz cut on a semi-daily basis but for larger jobs I&#x27;ll look into getting a professional Oster.</li>
            <li>I like to keep my stubble short, 1MM, and after a week of screwing around with this trimmer, I dug my old one -- a Philips -- out of the cupboard.</li>
            <li>It was actually delivered early.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never left a review on a product I&#x27;ve bought before because they have always directly reflected their review</li>
            <li>I prefer the prior Panasonic wet/dry beard trimmer to this one by far.  </li>
            <li>matter how careful or how much shaving cream I use or don&#x27;t use</li>
            <li>a trimmer it works OK, not great.</li>
            <li>This is sad because the item looks nice and was performing well otherwise.</li>
            <li>Of all the units I&#x27;ve tested and personally used, the Panasonic Milano wins hands down.</li>
            <li>Seriously, not one single illustration of how to take it apart.</li>
            <li>In order to trim down longer hair consistently you have to start at a much higher height and work your way down</li>
            <li>Caution...start out on the higher settings and work down to find the length you want.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is not as effective in cutting hair (on top of your head, I mean) as a dedicated barber&#x27;s clipper.</li>
            <li>Unlike a lot of other trimmers which can plug straight into the device, this one has a charging stand, and no other way to charge the device.  </li>
            <li>Read the reviews that complained about the dial being visible from front and back and, while that is true, it doesn&#x27;t take a genius to figure out which side you should read!  </li>
            <li>The attached comb can be precisely and quickly adjusted or removed for adjusting cutting height.</li>
            <li>agree with other reviewers that comment on the lack of a charge meter to let you know how much battery is left or when it is completely charged.&lt;br</li>
            <li>No mess left for me!</li>
            <li>I started out too long and quickly dial it down until I hit the length that I wanted.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Use it as a dry razor and oil it as you normally would.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Norelco in the past, and they were pretty decent, but I had to make several passes over my beard to get all the hair even.  </li>
            <li>I was tired of having all my hair trimmings cover the bathroom sink and my wife going crazy with the mess.&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer is powerful enough to use on my head as a close crop device and works brilliantly in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li>only other issues were that it takes a long time to charge up and the charge seems to die off quickly, but that could have been because of it struggling to cut through the coarser</li>
            <li>He usually groans at the thought of having to clean up his beard (he keeps it short) but not with this tool.</li>
            <li>The locking height setting cures a pet peeve with other trimmers that can change if to much pressure is applied.</li>
            <li>Other than that it works very well.</li>
            <li>I find that it&#x27;s hard to get an even, clean shave</li>
            <li>Hard to clean.</li>
            <li>hard to clean.</li>
            <li>The charge has lasted a long time so far!</li>
            <li>A little slow but cuts nice.</li>
            <li>This is a huge negative, since this trimmer can only be used as a cordless.  </li>
            <li>duh, I have to clean out and oil all my electric razors.</li>
            <li>You can really see the difference between a 9 mm long and a 10 mm long</li>
            <li>I will likely be purchasing another shaver for my beard in the near future.  </li>
            <li>He just went back to college and took this with him, and left his old electric razor here.  </li>
            <li>I have a feeling this one is going to last a while, so I&#x27;m glad I am not spending that while with a poorly designed, dysfunctional piece of shi...  Er, equipment.</li>
            <li>I wish the settings went a little higher so I could rock a thicker beard.</li>
            <li>Sometimes pulls hair - blades not sharp enough?  </li>
            <li>It took me a little bit to figure out exactly how to do that, because the instructions were unclear.  </li>
            <li>It sounds really underpowered, and the battery doesn&#x27;t last as long as I would prefer, but overall really solid feel, build, and</li>
            <li>This is the second time I&#x27;ve purchased this trimmer only because I dropped my previous one right on the head and bent the blades.</li>
            <li>the whole hour, here was my routine: I&#x27;d trim over about a 2 inch strip of beard, turn the thing off, take it apart, clear out every little hair, put it back together, turn it on, and repeat.</li>
            <li>The other ones that we have had have different shields that are easily lost and misplaced.  </li>
            <li>The base is a perfect cradle for this shaver; it doesn&#x27;t needlessly cling to the shaver, so it can easily be removed and placed back with one hand.  </li>
            <li>I use the Panasonic not only as a beard trimmer but also a general purpose body trimmer.</li>
            <li>The Braun, on the other hand, works extremely well, providing very consistent, even trimming on all parts of my beard.</li>
            <li>Seems there had been some conversation about the need to neaten up that beard and now there is no excuse.</li>
            <li>in fact the increments are so tiny that you can barely notice the difference between them)&lt;br</li>
            <li>No slipping of shaving guide head where you have different depths of trimming; here you just set and go!</li>
            <li>I like how quiet this trimmer is, it is barely noticeable.........</li>
            <li>The adjustable comb would be quite difficult to break without some considerable mishandling or a lofty drop (unless stored with the comb in its most extended length--not recommended obviously).  </li>
            <li>The adjustable comb would be quite difficult to break without some considerable mishandling or a lofty drop (unless stored with the comb in its most extended length--not recommended obviously).  </li>
            <li>First it trims my beard unevenly.</li>
            <li>Worth the purchase over others I&#x27;ve had in the past.</li>
            <li>I also use it on my head, and I&#x27;ve got a thick full head of hair.  </li>
            <li>Full beard, or thick beard (5-6ish mm)?</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it if you have a thick, full beard.  </li>
            <li>The guard pushes down the hair too much</li>
            <li>A little quieter than expected and almost sounds like it&#x27;s not going full bore,</li>
            <li>Other than that the unit has a decent quality feel to it</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is very unfortunate because I loved it enough to bare the cleaning and oiling and actually considered to give it 4 stars instead of 5.  </li>
            <li>guess other people just supplement with there regular shaver or straight razor...or simply don&#x27;t shave there neck or trim around your mustache or below your bottom lip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Before the Panasonic, I had a Wahl 9918-6171 Groomsman Beard and Mustache Trimmer for several years that I liked, but thought that I would get something with a little more power when the battery finally failed and I was forced to replace it.  </li>
            <li>is too large for tight spaces</li>
            <li>No more digging for the right attachment.  </li>
            <li>quite as high as other models.  </li>
            <li>I have had bad luck with attachments in the past, but this machine is awesome.</li>
            <li>The Guard is much shorter than my previous Remington trimmer.</li>
            <li>I guess 50 minutes run time goes a long way when it takes only a minute or so to trim up the old beard.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Had double trouble with Item ,needed to return twice, first trimmer would not snap-in ,than charger would not charge, would not recommend this shaver</li>
            <li>Also, it has a red light on the ugly dock which never turns to any other colors after many hour in charge.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Starting at the top of one sideburn down to my jaw line I slowly trim in the direction of hair growth after the row</li>
            <li>The new trimmer takes a long time to charge, but holds the charge for a long time.</li>
            <li>Have not used it wet, but dry trimming works very well.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;While it is water resistant the low-quality blade doesn&#x27;t really trim longer wet beard hairs, and even on a dry beard the longest setting (1cm) is quite short.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Cuts a little shorter than he wants</li>
            <li>It is also surprisingly small and light - much smaller and lighter than any other clippers I have used.  </li>
            <li>All those little hairs that insist on going straight outward get chopped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My husband needed a new trimmer for his beard, and since I had no first hand experience...</li>
            <li>Honestly, I would be willing to pay $200+ for a serious durable beard trimmer that is &#x27;truly&#x27; one-pass, but until then Ill stick with this one.</li>
            <li>Second, the advertisement of being able to use it in the shower is a little misleading, or at least it was to me.  </li>
            <li>For what you get, the price is very attractive.my clipper frequently, so I expect the oilable part of the clipper to get dull or fall apart eventually.</li>

            <li> Awesome shaver.  </li>
            <li> The best.</li>
            <li> Waterproof and in the shower is awesome</li>
            <li> though I have not yet encountered a design that would perfectly achieve this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works awesome except after 6 months the wings of the clipper height adjust have cracked and it no longer holds itself in the device.</li>
            <li> This thing is awesome!  </li>
            <li> I am genuinely impressed with this trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The best trimmer out there.</li>
            <li> Best electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> For what you get, the price is very attractive.</li>
            <li> It has very great precision while trimming...</li>
            <li> Another great product from Panasonic!</li>
            <li> great for use in the shower too!</li>
            <li> so I knew the size of this would be perfect.</li>
            <li> I think it is the best product of this type out there.</li>
            <li> Units that are manufactured for U.S.A, works best with U.S.A power supply.</li>
            <li> The best trimmer I have ever owned and looks like I will not have to replace it anytime soon</li>
            <li> It works wonderfully and gets the job done with efficiency and style.</li>
            <li> This is the best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> Excellent product!</li>

            <li> so Dad could have his own.</li>
            <li> Rather than wasting 20 bucks and waiting in line for an hour twice a month at a barbershop, I decided to try doing my own buzzes.  </li>
            <li> Nice beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> I liked it</li>
            <li> That means no car charging... which is nice to have that option.</li>
            <li> Excellent beard trimmer and very reliable.  </li>
            <li> Adjustable trim length is nice.  </li>
            <li> and I bought one for my husband because he liked it so well.  </li>
            <li> Nice shave and a multitude of length options.</li>
            <li> Turned the dial to the longest adjustment and found a nice bit of hair.</li>
            <li> Handy stand,</li>
            <li> It struggles to effectively trim the hair below my nose on my mustache.  </li>
            <li> My husband liked it.</li>
            <li> nice</li>
            <li> Update 11/2016 - While it worked, I liked this trimmer.  </li>
            <li> It is a nice produce.</li>
            <li> Also comes with a nice charging stand.</li>
            <li> This does a nice job keeping it trim.  </li>
            <li> so I need something that can work quickly, effectively and efficiently.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;He said that he liked it based on the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The product is nice and neat.  </li>
            <li> Nice rubberized grip won&#x27;t slip.</li>
            <li> Fits nice to the head......</li>
            <li> I used to have an old body trimmer which I considered it was good after years of usage, but after using this one you feel the difference, and the best of all is that this device is quieter.</li>
            <li> Nice product, I like the wet/dry ability.</li>
            <li> If you intend to use this in the shower, your warm water will run out before you finish and the trimming will be spotty.</li>
            <li> excellent incremental adjustments and easy to clean</li>
            <li> Really nice length adjustment.</li>
            <li> According to Men&#x27;s Health this is the best trimmer in the market and really is.&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li> but all in all is a nice product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does have a couple of nice features.</li>
            <li> The charger is nice and the clipper is well designed.</li>

            <li> It is nice that it is an all-in-one unit.</li>
            <li> Just my own preference.  </li>
            <li> Liked the shape and adjustability.</li>
            <li> I really just wanted a single-piece adjustable trimmer, and this has been the best one in this price range</li>

            <li> It cuts nice and even, no pulling of hairs.</li>
            <li> --they performed their job effectively, however--</li>

            <li> All in all I am very happy with the trimmer and would highly recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> My husband liked some features and not others.  </li>
            <li> The Comb is twist adjustable in mm measurements, which is handy</li>
            <li> And the price is more than fair.</li>
            <li> Really nice unit.&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li> My husband liked it from the word go.</li>
            <li> also would have liked the motor to be just a bit stronger and/or</li>
            <li> Nice wet/dry use feature.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t speak to how effective it is at shaving.</li>
            <li> Honestly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy, but my wife still wants me to shave ALL of my beard off.  </li>
            <li> The portability and shower use are nice.  </li>
            <li> Nice too that the shaver is waterproof.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nice trimmer for the beard.</li>
            <li> tried it yet, in the shower, but a nice option indeed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gave</li>

            <li> So far, though, I have been impressed with this Panasonic trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Nice settings easy to clean and great battery life.</li>
            <li> However, I didn&#x27;t own this thing for more than a couple weeks and the plastic height adjustment piece broke.</li>

            <li> Overall this is a great upgrade and a great product.</li>
            <li> This offers the best value (performance/cost) of all the many models I have used over the years.</li>
            <li> Works great for trimming my facial hair, great deal in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, works great in the shower, easy to clean and oil.</li>
            <li> Works great and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s OK at best, but feel a plug in is more accurate and consistent for thicker beards.</li>

            <li> It was actually better than I thought based on the performance.</li>

            <li> More than met all of my expectations and I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Have used several body trimmers over the years but this one is the best of the bunch.</li>

            <li> Love that it is waterproof.</li>
            <li> Since I used it about once a week, it&#x27;s more work than I want in a beard trimmer.  </li>

            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> Many settings for beard and hair length.</li>
            <li> I give it a 4 star just because the trimmer takes a bit more time in getting my beard trimmed ( but that might me just me though ).&lt;br</li>

            <li> Not only is it the best</li>

            <li> Glad I got it.</li>
            <li> My favorite shaver yet.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> After reading many reviews I decided to purchase the Panasonic Milano Series ER-GB40-S Hair &amp; Body Trimmer</li>
            <li> What he loves mostly, he can use it in the shower.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is top notch.  </li>
            <li> I love Panasonic products</li>
            <li> Manscapers will love this one.</li>
            <li> at the same time to pick the best one, but wound up returning that as well.  </li>
            <li> Overall the best body trimmer I have found.</li>
            <li> but it seems to be better than all of the ones that I have tried before.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned many brands.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> Powerful and stays charged a good while.  </li>
            <li> But this one is better and it&#x27;s water proof.</li>
            <li> and that makes it just okay.</li>
            <li> It is a better beard trimmer than a mustache trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Love this...  take it in the shower, or shave at sink.  </li>
            <li> It has not succeeded in convincing my wife that uniform longer is okay, but winning arguments wasn&#x27;t advertised as a feature.</li>
            <li> It looks more like 10 days of growth.</li>
            <li> This product is definitely more geared for face and head, not body.</li>
            <li> I love the adjustable dial and not having to switch guards in and out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is safe, no chance to cut your skin even if you are in a rush to trim your beard or genital hair</li>
            <li> Short of its longer than some blade it is an awesome tool to keep my beard in check.</li>
            <li> just make sure you keep oiling the blades as required by the owners manual.</li>
            <li> it is I always feel it needs to have more power.</li>
            <li> price watched before purchasing because it cost more than I wanted to spend.</li>
            <li> There might be something better or there, but you won&#x27;t regret this if ease of cleaning is a priority.</li>
            <li> I really love these.</li>
            <li> Much better then</li>
            <li> We just need more time to determine how it will hold up.</li>
            <li> The trimmer works ok.  </li>
            <li> I love it, and it hold a charge well.</li>
            <li> So glad I got it.  </li>
            <li> This is now one of my favorite possessions.</li>
            <li> The best male groomer on the market for sure.</li>
            <li> I have had it for more than year now.</li>
            <li> Love it...</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this trimmer.  </li>
            <li> I love that you can just dial a length and not have to change attachments and that it is cordless.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok but needs more power</li>
            <li> Ordered 4 for all the men in my life and they all love it.</li>
            <li> like i have because of the many length steps that can be configured.</li>
            <li> Love the incremental adjustments.</li>
            <li> BUT overall looks like a perfect answer for my needs and a highest quality product...</li>
            <li> Best facial product I have ever invested in!</li>
            <li> Works ok.</li>
            <li> They did a great job with this product.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was fast</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more like 3 day stubble.</li>
            <li> I can go 10 or more trims without charging it.</li>
            <li> It does ok as a body trimmer.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is okay</li>
            <li> and I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li> I believe that he was well pleased with the trimmer.</li>
            <li> Love it.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> any rate, it was the smoothest, most painless trim I have ever had.  </li>
            <li> Much better than the cheaper Norelco he&#x27;s been using.  </li>
            <li> Its ok.</li>
            <li> More on that</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t have made a better purchase.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my favorite</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> love the stand --except for one detail-- as it allows for one-handed stowage and removal.  </li>
            <li> I use it to trim neck hair mostly.</li>
            <li> Love the Panasonic wet/dry shavers.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t find a better one at this price.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> love the rechargable aspect.</li>
            <li> Had a $15 Whal that was better.</li>
            <li> I wish it had more power to cut through my beard faster.</li>
            <li> Love that all you have to do is turn to increase or decrease the height.</li>
            <li> Most people think of Remington when they think of electric shavers and trimmers, but I have to say this Panasonic was quite pleasing!&lt;br</li>
            <li> The trimmer is quieter than many I&#x27;ve used, but still makes quite a bit of noise.</li>
            <li> CUT ANY BETTER THAT</li>
            <li> Easy to clean and looks good too sitting on the sink.</li>
            <li> , may have a lot more power then this.  </li>
            <li> This shouldn&#x27;t be price more then Philips 4050 at $49.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has some nice benefits, but also some huge negatives.  </li>
            <li> However, I do have a problem with the comb on top of the trimmer.  </li>
            <li> and it hasn&#x27;t got any better.</li>
            <li> As beard and sideburn trimmers they are outstanding.  </li>
            <li> &quot; so we were thinking that he would be able to trim his head with this.</li>
            <li> I love that it is able to be used in the shower.</li>
            <li> Glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> When the battery starts to age, I won&#x27;t be able to stretch the use of the device by using it while it is plugged in.</li>
            <li> , hopefully it holds up, love the adjustment setting without having to change the spacer.</li>
            <li> Love the size setting dial.</li>
            <li> Still much better than a Remington it  </li>
            <li> I love the rotating selection wheel.</li>
            <li> The adjustable length works great and is very convenient.</li>
            <li> dial to adjust the height of the shaving guard is leagues better than that on the ER224S.  </li>
            <li> Outside of that the trimmer works great!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even use the unit more than 2 times a week.</li>
            <li> It is better than the cheapie I used to have.</li>
            <li> Better than the clip on attachments.</li>
            <li> It does not work better around the chin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Charging: The stand is much better than most trimmers I have owned to date.</li>
            <li> Much better length control.</li>
            <li> I just got this today and just used it, stop searching and wasting your time, this is the trimmer, my beard hair grows every different way and it cut everything evenly and perfectly.  </li>
            <li> Love mine.</li>
            <li> Also love that it is waterproof and has the adjustable trim guard built in.</li>
            <li> It takes a bit longer with these because I have to go over my head more than usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After several months still work perfectly, I will buy again.</li>
            <li> I bought a Wahl about 3 months ago and it cut sort of ok for a while</li>
            <li> I love this thing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s also shaped sort of neutrally; many times I&#x27;d find I was trying to use it backwards because of its ergonomics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The map pointing to where you are to oil the razor isn&#x27;t perfectly diagrammed but you get the idea upon further examination.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it seems like I shouldn&#x27;t have so many problematic hairs.  </li>
            <li> Y&#x27;all are gonna love this product in every way.....</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love the ability and way this trimmer adjusts.</li>
            <li> Love the comb</li>
            <li> Love the wet/dry capability.  </li>
            <li> but what I will say so much better razors out there.</li>
            <li> I love it, it might not be the cheapest</li>
            <li> I really love this product.</li>
            <li> then you will have trimming everywhere, which is why I love Philips Norelco&#x27;s trimmer.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li> (did not yank the hairs) and I was able to rinse it off in the sink.  </li>
            <li> This a well made product that I thought I would get more use out of, but the cons outweigh the pros for me and my family.</li>
            <li> Even so, I&#x27;ve never found a trimmer that I was truly satisfied with...</li>
            <li> Changing the lengths is super easy, it cuts great, easy cleaning.</li>
            <li> Originally gifted this to my husband in 2013 after his Philips Norelco T980 died (it couldn&#x27;t hold a charge after about two years).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned many beard trimmers over the years.</li>
            <li> product I ended up getting which could do everything this Panasonic could do and more, was the Philips Norelco QG3364/42 Multigroom Beard Trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Battery life is great, charges fast, no complaints whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m over it :)</li>
            <li> satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is light which is good for convenience but to the point of being so lightweight that it felt cheap and plastic.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Rechargeable&lt;br /&gt;Lithium-Ion Battery lasts many uses before recharging&lt;br</li>
            <li> The top pops off to provide a precision trimmer for closer cuts.</li>
            <li> I also love that I can rinse it off under running water.</li>
            <li> and I am extremely satisfied with the results.  </li>
            <li> It would be OK if you want to keep a stubble look.</li>
            <li> I am quite pleased with this item.</li>
            <li> I love this razor.</li>
            <li> more like fumbling around to get it seated correctly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Would be better if had some indicator as to charge level.</li>
            <li> One would think more companies would capitalize on this, but of course not.</li>
            <li> Which takes more time.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really work that great for me...</li>
            <li> okay...  </li>
            <li> I think they&#x27;d be better off with a more rounded head to help with this.  </li>
            <li> It even looks better.  </li>
            <li> I was additionally pleased as an email from Amazon Prime</li>
            <li> In use, the Panasonic&#x27;s adjustments seem to be more for show than use.</li>
            <li> Perhaps it works better as a hair trimmer  </li>
            <li> - it sure looks like many people like it.</li>
            <li> The directions say it&#x27;s okay to keep it on the charger.</li>
            <li> Love this shaver.</li>
            <li> Already owned one when I picked up this Panasonic, but wasn&#x27;t terribly satisfied with what I was using and thought maybe an upgrade would be worthwhile.</li>
            <li> All in all, really pleased.</li>
            <li> Works ok.</li>
            <li> Hoping in time they will have one with more</li>
            <li> I have been impressed with this trimmer and will buy another when this one finally wears out.</li>
            <li> Have really enjoyed this.  </li>
            <li> thing that I can think to make it better would be ION battery.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product, I totally recommend this beard trimmer, for the price I paid</li>
            <li> I downgraded it one star because it could use better instructions.</li>
            <li> So many I lose count.  </li>
            <li> pleased with this trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;**Am now using the Panasonic ER-BG60-K (Oct 2015) - which is even better than the ER-BG40.</li>
            <li> He was able to trim it up and will be able to maintain the length he prefers.</li>
            <li> Love it, bought one for my son &amp; he loves it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how many of these thing I have had over the years.</li>
            <li> With the Panasonic Milano ER-GB40-S, it takes two passes at the most.  </li>
            <li> You just have to make sure you go against the grain</li>
            <li> Perhaps I should wonder that more often.  </li>
            <li> This clipper is just okay.  </li>
            <li> but if it had a vacuum that collected the hairs as you trimmed them it would be the best trimmer!</li>
            <li> It is, however, handy to be able to use running water to clean the trimmer.</li>
            <li> Nice design; like the charging cradle; seem well built; but just not as good as some of my older trimmers</li>
            <li> So far, so good!  </li>
            <li> Works great so far, pretty happy with it.</li>
            <li> my  new #1! and  great value as well</li>
            <li> In a time when more and more trimmers are becoming Maintenance-free, this trimmer requires you to oil</li>
            <li> Great product, replaced older Norelco.  </li>
            <li> to clean, just run warm water over it.</li>
            <li> Its been extremely handy having a trimmer that can be washed with water to clean.</li>
            <li> its always nice and clean.</li>
            <li> But the easy use and the way to cut on different  lengths they are awesome.</li>
            <li> Relatively quiet, easily adjusted, works perfectly.  </li>
            <li> Being able to quick rinse is nice as well&lt;</li>
            <li> Very cool feature for sure.</li>
            <li> Cuts very precisely and easy to care for.</li>
            <li> As a &amp;#34;foliclely challenged&amp;#34; male, it just makes more sense to trim my own hair and beard extra-short, and this trimmer works great.  </li>
            <li> This did a really good job when I first got it.</li>
            <li> pretty good.  </li>
            <li> First, I do not feel the quality of the trim is good when removing the guard and using it to do detail cleanup along the edge of my beard.  </li>
            <li> ts and charges and lasts long to trim everything and is the best razo arpund that works</li>
            <li> This works pretty good</li>
            <li> The adjustable head works pretty good.</li>
            <li> maybe once or twice but not bad, and honestly,.</li>
            <li> The battery started getting weaker and shaver isn&#x27;t as good as when i first got it...</li>
            <li> in all, this has been the best trimmer I have had in a long time.</li>
            <li> The Close shave doesn&#x27;t do a good job and the trimmers don&#x27;t give you a consistent length.&lt;br</li>
            <li> And the blade is cheap and easily replaceable!&lt;br /&gt;Thankyou Panasonic!</li>
            <li> I had to return this, not at all worth the money!!</li>
            <li> The one cordless shaver he had broke and he spend a great deal of time trying to find a new one.</li>
            <li> Great trimmer, light and very quite.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, not as strong of a motor as I would like.</li>
            <li> Best to use dry.</li>
            <li> I just let the shower run over it to get the hair clippings off of it, but it also has a water hole for letting water push through it and force hair out of the clipping end which is super nice for when it gets clogged.  </li>
            <li> I Love the easy to adjust height control.</li>
            <li> I also love that it&#x27;s water proof and can be rinsed out easily from beard trimmings.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You can quickly dial-in what you want which is nice.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure I could easily go 2 weeks without a problem... maybe longer.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean and stores nicely.</li>
            <li> trims very well and very good control on the length (prevent from making holes if not at the right angle)</li>
            <li> This trimmer is can be used in the shower and is very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> It cuts face and body hair with no pulling an dthe clean up is very easy.</li>
            <li> It is a clean cut and very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Very easy to clean as well.</li>
            <li> very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> it is very light and fits comfortably in your hand.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very precise and smooth to use.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Otherwise, this is pretty good all around; you&#x27;ll probably be just fine at the price point.</li>
            <li> This timmer is very easy to use and adjust, also easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> Other wise very nice adjustment feature.</li>
            <li> I am kind of a Panasonic fan boy - I have many of their products (plasma TV, audio equipment, kitchen appliances) and generally, they are all at the very top of their categories.</li>
            <li> I have had these for about a week, and so far, they work great.  </li>
            <li> This trimmer is way better than the cheap one I used for years.</li>
            <li> Glad I didn&#x27;t go for the cheap trimmer again.</li>
            <li> I like the charging station and the many adjustments available.  </li>
            <li> So far works great</li>
            <li> I decided on this shaver based on the reviews and it has work great so far.</li>
            <li> I also am pleased with the LED light that shows that the shaver is being charged ...</li>
            <li> Very durable and feels good in the hand.</li>
            <li> This is a real shame, because it&#x27;s an otherwise good product: wet/dry, rinsable, guide works well when working.</li>
            <li> thanks for good quality</li>
            <li> Works very well and has a good battery life</li>
            <li> He said the attachments make it very versatile, and it is a good quality trimmer.</li>
            <li> This thing is worth every penny,  the adjustment dial is really nice,  </li>
            <li> a good job on my very curly beard.&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li> Easy to use although I have to remind myself which way to use hold it to make sure I trim accurately.  </li>
            <li> I love the numbered dial, it gives me easy and accurate repeatability as I do the sides of my beard shorter than my chin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite a bit smaller and sleeker than what I&#x27;m used to, but am so impressed with HOW it works, you get over that quickly.  </li>
            <li> Works great, solid product, nice clean cut.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure the wet/dry feature of this shaver is very meaningful; those are best for a clean shave and easy cleanup.  </li>
            <li> Very nice upgrade from 10 yr old Wahl I was using.</li>
            <li> He has a full beard and uses it for that and also his chest!</li>
            <li> Sweet!  </li>
            <li> Very good product take in the shower cuts fantastic, hell you can use it to shave with my only problem with it</li>
            <li> Easy to use, easy to clean, easy to love.</li>
            <li> Trims great, makes you want to grow more facial hair.</li>
            <li> This shaver is ok, the shaver doesn&#x27;t give a smooth shave so another one might need to be used to smooth shave.</li>
            <li> and I believe the attached comb prongs will not so easily brake as what happened with my Phillips trimmer.  </li>
            <li> It also has an easy to use adjustment wheel with changes every .5 mm.  </li>
            <li> They have all been quality products and I am very loyal to them.</li>
            <li> wow perfect and really go Under water</li>
            <li> /&gt;Seems to trim evenly, cleans up fairly easily, and fits well in your hand.</li>
            <li> The adjustable dial for length is easy to use, although if you don&#x27;t pay attention you can change it without noticing.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, rinse, and recharge.</li>
            <li> Cleaning is easy with the included brush.</li>
            <li> This one seems a lot more durable, easy to clean, and I don&#x27;t need to replace the batteries once a month.</li>
            <li> easy to use...</li>
            <li> Tends to grab once in a while, but it does make beard trims easy.</li>
            <li> Glides easily and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer is easy to adjust and leaves a even finish.  </li>
            <li> Washes easily and holds a charge.</li>
            <li> The dial makes it easy.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t make a mistake with the easy dial</li>
            <li> Easy to use</li>
            <li> , the blades themselves get clogged with hair incredibly easily.</li>
            <li> Care is easy and the charger is even easier.</li>
            <li> Met my expectations, easy use, good blades and a decent battery life</li>
            <li> Easy to use and the water hasn&#x27;t seemed to effect it at all.</li>
            <li> Easy to adjust.  </li>
            <li> Easy to adjust.</li>
            <li> Easy to charge.</li>
            <li> lightwieght and easy to hold as it has a rubber grip handle.</li>
            <li> Excellent design, very durable construction, soft and functional operation.</li>
            <li> Easy to maneuver and easy on the face.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use</li>
            <li> The guard comes on and off easily and stays where you put it.</li>
            <li> Easy to handle.</li>
            <li> Easy to change the cut length, and never nick myself again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it.</li>
            <li> Go aganst the grain at a longer setting for shortening.&lt;br /&gt;So easy to use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is easy to handle for cutting.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Lightweight and can be easily cleaned.</li>
            <li> The beard guard that comes with it comes off and on easily.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> The guard doesn&#x27;t come off easily.</li>
            <li> Good:&lt;br /&gt;Ergonomic feel, easy to use at varying angles and with either hand.&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li> shape makes it relatively easy to trim tricky areas of face (ie.</li>
            <li> The oilable part of the Panasonic clipper snaps out easily.</li>
            <li> It cuts hair easily and goes quite a while on one</li>
            <li> Cleans up easily so it doesn&#x27;t look like a smudged mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is easily the quickest one I&#x27;ve every owned.  </li>
            <li> Here is the bottom line on this trimmer for me - it works very quickly and leaves me with a trim and neat beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It misses a lot of hairs but charges well and is incredibly easy to use.</li>
            <li> The trimming blade unsnaps for easy cleaning and oiling.</li>
            <li> This can be easily lost.  </li>
            <li> The guard detaches easily for deeper cleaning.</li>
            <li> On this unit, I like that the comb is adjustable, and easily removed if you want to get closer.</li>
            <li> It holds a charge forever and cleans up easily.</li>
            <li> I thought the razor disassembled for cleaning quite easily.  </li>
            <li> it was not \\&quot;easy as pie\\&quot; to get the job done.  </li>
            <li> I can easily adjust the size i need for my cut.</li>
            <li> Easy to adjust, easy to hold and easy to charge.  </li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband for easy clean-up (no clean-up if used in the shower) and for ease of use.</li>
            <li> The comb comes off easily it</li>
            <li> Extremely easy to get a sculpted trim.</li>

            <li> easy to use and easy to maintain.  </li>
            <li> Easy non hassle trimmer.</li>
            <li> Plenty of settings and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> And, it&#x27;s wet-dry, ergonomic, cleans easy, and can even (somewhat) trim the hair on your head.</li>
            <li> Well made, easily adjustable and does not &amp;#34;catch&amp;#34; my face, even in a close trim, which I use often.</li>
            <li> In that regard, the Panasonic easily beats the Remington.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More</li>
            <li> But for a precise and reliable trim, with a battery that won&#x27;t die unexpectedly, this has been a great trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The blade is narrow, and the settings are great for a beard, not so good for stubble.</li>
            <li> The amazon return experience was easy though.</li>
            <li> stand&lt;br /&gt;-Water pass-through hole for easy cleaning&lt;</li>
            <li> Cuts well, holds a charge and is easy to hold.</li>
            <li> Being waterproof makes cleaning easy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any easy way of replacing those parts.  </li>
            <li> Multiple-settings are easy to adjust.&lt;br</li>
            <li> He likes to have a neatly trimmed beard and with this razor and all of the attachments it is easy to be well groomed all of the time.</li>
            <li> Strongly recommend.</li>
            <li> The twist adjustment allows any length choice and the gears are strong.</li>
            <li> Battery strong.</li>
            <li> Motor didn&#x27;t seem too strong.</li>
            <li> I use it mainly as a beard trimmer and it does a fairly good job.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still going strong and hasn&#x27;t lost its charge during periods of non use.</li>
            <li> The better application for the waterproof attribute is that you can just rinse the whole thing off after you use it which is nice because hair sticks to it, esp.</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S OK, NOTHING SPECIAL.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean, adjust and cuts very cleanly.</li>
            <li> Pretty amazing quality of battery.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;d prefer to use it without the guard, it slips off really easily and works just fine</li>
            <li> The comb can easily be removed to allow for the blades to be cleaned or to allow for fine trimming,</li>
            <li> First, its shortest setting will not give a beard or mustache that three day growth look which is currently popular.</li>
            <li> 15 hour full charge doesn&#x27;t bother me because I&#x27;ve never had occasion to use it more than once a day.  </li>
            <li> The guard is pretty handy, even though I wish it had adjustments for longer hair.</li>
            <li> Beard is coming along nicely ;)</li>
            <li> It would have been pretty easy &amp; cheap to include some kind of indicator on it, but Panasonic must have figured it would be even easier &amp; cheaper not to...</li>
            <li> He said it was easy to use, very comfortable and super easy to clean.</li>
            <li> The guard is easy to adjust, stays put, and seems accurate.  </li>
            <li> Works fine in or out of shower.</li>
            <li> I got it with black friday discount and its the best beard trimmer I have ever seen .</li>
            <li> A fine waterproof unit for all of your trimming needs.</li>
            <li> Adjustable head allows any length you want and runs smooth and cleans easily</li>
            <li> I then just throw it up a half MM to blend it in with the sideburns and it is perfect.</li>
            <li> then I think this is a fine choice.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Since this is pretty much meant for beards and nether regions, I can vouch that it works great for both of those things.    </li>
            <li> and it was fine.</li>
            <li> It does pull on my beard at times, but works fine for shaving my head.</li>
            <li> but I think for beard trimming its fine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worked fine as a shaver.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, easy to clean and nice crisp trim.</li>
            <li> Comfortable and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> They are easy to use, easy to adjust, and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> It could be easily corrected if the manual had detailed diagram that shows them and where they belong.</li>
            <li> Is very adjustable from bald to a good full beard setting.</li>
            <li> The comb/guide comes off and on easily, and is comfortable on my face.&lt;br /&gt;Clean up:</li>
            <li> The issue is taking the adjuster off to do the fine lines.  </li>
            <li> While I don&#x27;t use it &amp;#34;wet,&amp;#34; I do rather enjoy the easy cleaning</li>
            <li> It is light and easy to use.</li>
            <li> It is still running just fine.  </li>
            <li> The charging stand looks nice and the trimmer sits securely in it, overall very pleased with this</li>
            <li> It worked fine for trimming body hair in the shower.  </li>
            <li> But the biggest problem is, when you take the head off to do some fine detail trimming or trim around your mouth, it pulls your hair out.  </li>
            <li> Light, easy to use, and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I love it for a quick trim of the beard.</li>
            <li> Smart, easy, effective.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Quick and easy to shave&lt;br /&gt;Quick and easy to clean and adjust&lt;br /&gt;Small, light and easy to hold</li>

            <li> simple to use and easy  great charger.  </li>
            <li> Nice touch making the ends of the prongs rounded so an accidental poke doesn&#x27;t smart.  </li>
            <li> This has a smooth, comfortable plastic guard that does a fine job of protecting you from nicks and electric razor burns.</li>
            <li> While you may be able to get a better one, this unit certainly gives you a huge bang for your buck.</li>

            <li> Light but feels solid.&lt;br</li>

            <li> Easy to clean</li>
            <li> The adjustable comb broke on me, one of the teeth that securely fastens the comb to the blade did anyway, and trying to use it after that was just a fumble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> My beard is just gonna be grateful for this smooth, trimming experience.</li>
            <li> I was looking for two things in a trimmer: 1) a precise hair depth cut adjustment and 2) not noisy to wake my wife in the morning.</li>
            <li> : The trimmer is comfortable to hold while trimming.</li>
            <li> It fits nicely in the hand and has a reasonable amount of adjustability.</li>
            <li> and I think I may be use to its&#x27; more powerful feel in your hand when you turn it</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is well-made apart from the fact that the battery and blade are really cheap</li>
            <li> Wish it had attachments but is a precise trimmer for beards.</li>
            <li> Great product, the only problem I find is the need to lubricate it after each use.</li>
            <li> easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean hair from it.</li>
            <li> Bizarre...</li>
            <li> I bought this primarily to use as hair clippers.  </li>
            <li> it does everything, it has a very solid build quality too, feels great in hand.</li>
            <li> The engineering on this product makes it easy to use, clean, and charge whenever and wherever.</li>
            <li> easy to clean and meets all that is advertised</li>
            <li> Lightweight, but bordering on feeling too light</li>
            <li> (mostly light trimming).  </li>
            <li> cheap hair trimmer (you know...</li>
            <li> Overall great item</li>
            <li> So easy to clean and holds a charge for a sufficient amount of time.</li>
            <li> But having tested many trimmers over my many bearded years, the Panasonic is nowhere near the top.</li>
            <li> adjusting knob is really precise</li>
            <li> Easy to clean and maintain.  </li>
            <li> charging stand is solid and attractive on the counter.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> It does not feel comfortable when trying to get a 3.5 trim.</li>
            <li> It is good so far.</li>
            <li> it is still old school for a good clipper.</li>
            <li> Good so far.  </li>
            <li> This is far superior to that one.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>

            <li> So Far So Good.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> I love the charging stand and has a good solid feel in my hand.</li>
            <li> Lightweight, holds charge for a while, fabulous in the shower or sink, and the height adjustability is very useful.  </li>
            <li> i am totally hair free....!!!</li>
            <li> Really!?!?!  </li>
            <li> Very powerful and reliable.</li>
            <li> However, it is very effective at what it does and simple to make hair length adjustments.</li>
            <li> Very nice, simple to use trimmer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is so so easy to clean, and it is water proof of course so that i can use it in the shower and clean it in the sink etc.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to adjust and I really like that it is chargeable so there are no annoying cords to deal with.</li>

            <li> Charges up quickly and trims easily.  </li>
            <li> I recommend it for those who want a quick, easy trim.</li>
            <li> Changing trim length is super easy with the dial.</li>
            <li> Because I&#x27;ve never used a different beard trimmer I can&#x27;t speak to whether another trimmer might be just as good for less money, but I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> The blades cut through hair easily, and the length is quick to dial in.</li>
            <li> The fact that I can dial the length setting makes adjusting the setting quick and easy.  </li>
            <li> Cleans easily, charges quick, and you can use it in the shower.</li>
            <li> It is so easy to change the length by twisting the dial to quickly chose any look.</li>

            <li> High quality construction and nicely styled.</li>
            <li> It was replaced quickly and the second unit has been great- until today (June of 2017).  </li>
            <li> He said it works great, better than his previous unit</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is also super easy to clean.</li>
            <li> This is a wet/dry unit, so clean up is quick and easy.</li>
            <li> I was concerned with the range in beard height (up to 10mm), but after using it for the past month, i have found 6.5mm to be perfect for me.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> I get a more consistent trim on my beard, works get on body hair as well.</li>
            <li> Works Great, Holds Charge for a long time</li>
            <li> Good for general manscaping</li>
            <li> overall nice!</li>
            <li> I use it primarily to trim my beard, this is the third trimmer that I have owned and this one is the best by far.</li>
            <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, you just need to but more time into it than I am willing to put in I guess.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the money too!</li>
            <li> The waterproof aspect is why I took a chance on it originally.</li>
            <li> In short it&#x27;s an awesome trimmer, but you better remember to slap it back on the charger when you&#x27;re done.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be using this in close quarters while someone else is sleeping if you want to maintain a friendly relationship.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works great and the charge lasts a long time for my use.</li>
            <li> Works great, goes a long time without having to recharge.</li>
            <li> Well worth every penny!</li>
            <li> my first orders charger braked and that changed it and its working fantastic, I recommend this product for everyone, its beautiful, silent and works great.&lt;br /&gt;its</li>
            <li> It has not disappointed.</li>
            <li> But, I gifted this to him firstly because its all in one product.</li>
            <li> worth every penny!</li>
            <li> So when I opened this package, I was really excited.</li>
            <li> I was hoping by spending more money on a beard trimmer it would be of higher quality.  </li>
            <li> Very comfortable to hold and looks nice enough to keep in its charger on the bathroom counter - sort of.</li>
            <li> I previously bought the panasonic wet/dry shaver and the quality very good.</li>
            <li> Does a good job on my beard, and I am informed (ahem) that it also works very well for a certain woman to trim around her bikini line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Does a very nice job...much better than my previous trimmer.  </li>
            <li> You can really get your stubble to a very fine length with this puppy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> is perfect for getting those tough areas at the top of your ears.  </li>
            <li> great clippers,  ultra sharp, and the adjustable length settings are a neat feature that makes your trimming really easy and even</li>
            <li> Has great power and long battery life!</li>
            <li> I was excited to try out this shaver, since I&#x27;ve tried many and found only one that I liked: the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> i have used many other brands and this is by far the best.  </li>
            <li> We got this because my boyfriend cuts his own hair and he needed a new hair shaver.</li>
            <li> Want to clean the head?</li>
            <li> I tried a popular department store brand before I tried this, and this is much better quality even though almost the same price.</li>
            <li> The clipper guard itself seems to be precariously connected to the system and pulling it out to clean it almost feels like you are going to break it.</li>
            <li> I have tried several electric shavers, and this is by far the best!  </li>
            <li> you can clean it up with water, but would not buy another.</li>
            <li> Makes clean up a breeze.  </li>
            <li> I used to be able to hold my old trimmer away from my face and still cut which allowed for a better view while trimming.</li>
            <li> He loves the fact that you can rinse it under water to clean.</li>
            <li> Also, you can use it in the shower and clean it with water, so that&#x27;s convenient.</li>
            <li> This is a very to use product and it is able to do a smooth job without pulling the hair out by the roots.</li>
            <li> It gave me a clean shave.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve only been using it for about a month, but so far we are VERY happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Would recommend for anyone who likes to keep trim and clean.</li>
            <li> fully charged this has an incredible battery life, however the trimmer does not have any indicator to let you know when the battery is dying or how much life you have left.  </li>
            <li> biggest benefit of this trimmer is probably the fact that you can use it in the shower, and clean it by running water through it.  </li>
            <li> With that said, I still find it faster to wash this under water and apply 3 drops of oil, then have to clean the trimmer with a brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> clean is defiantly a plus,</li>
            <li> Shorten up my beard to an accurate length quickly (</li>
            <li> And the clean up is a snap too.</li>
            <li> After using it the 5th time when I pulled the guide off to clean the blade area, the tip of of the two pieces in the handle that hold the guard in place snapped off.</li>
            <li> pros: you can clean with water</li>
            <li> because it didnt give me a clean shave(leaves you with a 5&#x27;oclock</li>
            <li> water proof makes cleaning a breeze just wish it had the ability to remove the guard to clean up the edges.</li>
            <li> , I use this in the shower and keep my vanity clean.</li>
            <li> Like clean out feature.</li>
            <li> This simple addition is mind-blowingly effective in making sure that the comb keeps the hair at the selected level without interfering with it&#x27;s contact with the blades.  </li>
            <li> The unit has a pleasant low level hum when working.</li>
            <li> Without the length adjuster on top it seems good and sharper than expected for precision trimming.</li>
            <li> It works great in and out of the shower and the single adjustable guide is genius.</li>
            <li> the overwhelming number of positive reviews would make you think so too, but that WAS NOT the case.</li>
            <li> I bought this one for my son, and I liked it so much I am ordering one for myself right now.</li>
            <li> work very good for trimming my tee... takes a little practice</li>
            <li> Highly adjustable, super easy to clean, charge stays strong, easy to grip even in soapy shower.  </li>
            <li> In his words, it shaves very smooth and doesnt vibrate much.</li>
            <li> It does not make much noise and is very smooth on the skin</li>
            <li> Super user friendly and a cinch to clean and lube.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m really in love with this, I appreciate the stand, that&#x27;s purely aesthetically-pleasing though.  </li>
            <li> It could use a bit more power, as it pulls the hair when using it in certain directions, like when making the beard outline.  </li>
            <li> I was right!</li>
            <li> It trims my goatee just right !</li>
            <li> Quiet, holds a good charge,easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> The stand is kinda&#x27; big and clunky and not as good when you are trying to keep the bathroom counter cleared off and looking neat and clean.  </li>
            <li> Constant oiling of the device is required for good clean cuts.</li>
            <li> The control over trimming length and ability to rinse/get wet is great.</li>
            <li> I have used many trimmers in the past and the Remington brand worked great.</li>
            <li> Worked as expected, great battery life.</li>
            <li> It provides an even, consistent, and fully adjustable trim and is so easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> This thing is small but excellent, worth the money.</li>
            <li> Accurately and quickly tidy up my neckline and trim stubble below it with the bare trimmer blade</li>
            <li> I have been using it just for a few days, but first impression is AWESOME!</li>
            <li> Nice product, exactly as advertised, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> It is amazing the difference between this and my old beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> They devote two full pages to \\&quot;how to trim your beard\\&quot;, with lavish illustrations.</li>
            <li> He uses it all the time but for those really close shaves you do need a razor for smooth skin!</li>
            <li> I was very hesitant to purchase this, but I am glad i did.  </li>
            <li> a MUCH more precise instrument that simply does a better job than any Wahl trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Thats cool).</li>
            <li> I think it will take a full explanation of why the cancelations before I consider ordering anything from Amazon again.  </li>
            <li> does good for short hair&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> Just take care of it by following the directions specified by the manufacturer, and it should be a good device.</li>
            <li> The shaver lasted for 4 full trims without charging.</li>
            <li> It has a good trimmer-guard which delivers evenly-cut facial hair.</li>
            <li> Works very well and love the adjustable head unit.</li>
            <li> Also, there is no indicator of how full the battery is or even if it&#x27;s fully charged.</li>
            <li> I keep a full beard and use for trimming and shaping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had 1 of these for about a year and decided it would make a good B-day present for my Twin bro...</li>
            <li> Clippers that are designed to be doing full haircuts have longer comb attachments than this one.</li>
            <li> They give me the full refund when I has a issue with the trimmer.</li>
            <li> This product helps you keep your beard trimmed so you can avoid ingrown hairs and has a lot of cool features.  </li>
            <li> I just love that part and it is very convenient to use.</li>
            <li> i returned  this because unit sent to did allow full cleaning of cutter blade.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s good for hitting some spots but adds to the time needed to trim larger areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> good for short beard</li>
            <li> the full spectrum of graduated settings and the ease of</li>
            <li> it has just a NiMH battery instead of a more modern lithium battery.</li>
            <li> Waterproof is good, if only for ease in cleaning.</li>
            <li> I love the adjustable head, so much easier than my Wahl</li>
            <li> It has so many setting which makes it very versatile.</li>
            <li> I have only good things to say about it.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s really just better to go find a barber who&#x27;ll do it well and inexpensively.</li>
            <li> Looks cool and holds a charge for weeks.</li>
            <li> The ease was even misleading to the point that we gave them a try in a full haircut.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know that there were such superior trimmers out there.  </li>
            <li> can&#x27;t imagine going to another beard trimmer now, without equal or superior performance.  </li>
            <li> can&#x27;t imagine going to another beard trimmer now, without equal or superior performance.  </li>
            <li> I love the charging dock that comes with it, very convenient.</li>
            <li> It feels good in hand, and has several length settings in .5 increments.  </li>
            <li> On a good note-its quiet.</li>
            <li> The waterproof design and .5 increments are greatly appreciated. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Works ok but for me this and every beard trimmer i&#x27;ve owned just doesn&#x27;t cut very evenly.  </li>
            <li> Will last 10+ years with good care.</li>
            <li> My goatee is the only thing the trimmer is good for.</li>
            <li> The charging cradle is nice and so far the battery works well.</li>
            <li> You have to go against the grain, or hair angle to get good results and then go over and over it multiple times.</li>
            <li> The final result is good.</li>
            <li> Needed and loved for daily maintenance.</li>
            <li> Many usable settings (unusual among trimmers - this has some really good settings for short beards)&lt;br</li>
            <li> Used for my balding head, works fairly well; waterproof a big plus as can use in shower with no clean-up to speak of.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true.  </li>
            <li> But I though, surely there&#x27;s room for improvement, and the Panasonic, with it&#x27;s built-in adjusting wheel seemed promising.</li>
            <li> This is basically a $10 trimmer with a bunch of really cool options.</li>
            <li> Works as expected battery life good and easy to clean and maintain.</li>
            <li> I found the teeth of the comb/guide too far apart to effectively lift my beard for trimming.</li>
            <li> But for regular use, it&#x27;s a fair trade off to not have a cord dangling in my way.  </li>
            <li> This Panasonic machine is not bad</li>
            <li> This is never a bad thing in regards to a -- \\&quot;man groomer\\&quot; tool.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a little over a week, and it still seems fully charged, which is good news for taking it on trips!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Now, on the positive side, this is great for men who have facial hair.</li>
            <li> The battery life is incredible on this, i can shave for weeks at a time without ever having to charge this thing, and it doesn&#x27;t start degrading the performance of the trimmer as the battery drains, its a very consistent experience until the battery is almost completely dead.  </li>
            <li> So easy to set he length of my beard, and be consistent with it.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is easy to adjust and it works pretty well.</li>
            <li> Not long after buying it, the non-replaceable battery was no longer able to hold its charge for more than a day or so.  </li>
            <li> Have that&#x27;s used the dry mode thus far, but it&#x27;s an excellent and very exact trimmer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The most important things that I wanted in a beard trimmer was something that would be quiet, work quickly and evenly, and clean up easily.  </li>
            <li> I use this to shave my scalp/head every other day and it works great.</li>
            <li> My other shaver I rearly oiled and it cut great.</li>
            <li> Best cordless shaver I&#x27;ve bought in awhile and has lasted long time without charging that&#x27;s a major plus</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s easy to clean and maintain (comes with ample oil to treat blades between use) and is built very well with the consumer in mind.  </li>
            <li> I also love the ability to adjust so many different lengths.</li>
            <li> I take a quick look to see if there is any excess build up I thought that might have ben the problem</li>
            <li> I used to have a forfex which was recommended by a professional hair stylist, and although the motor and blades were top notch, the attachments were cheap, brittle plastic from china and kept breaking.  </li>
            <li> when I switched to the Panasonic I found that it worked better and had decent batteries and charging system..</li>
            <li> Quick adjust dial.  </li>
            <li> it was the same one that lasted for many many years</li>
            <li> Battery life and power are adequate don&#x27;t be convinced that lithium ion is where it&#x27;s at..</li>
            <li> The Philips felt more powerful, but the way the trimmer guard attached to it was very flimsy and one fall would probably break</li>
            <li> Although it undoubtedly will be reliable and durable, this trimmer is merely adequate and nothing</li>
            <li> dropped it from my hand 2-3 times but luckily there wasn&#x27;t any damage</li>
            <li> Thanks for making such a great product Panasonic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m able to trim my beard and shape it exactly how I want at the exact length that I want it.</li>
            <li> and you can read far more detailed reviews from others.  </li>
            <li> I have to pass it over the same spots many, many times.</li>
            <li> it is quick and doesn&#x27;t irritate his skin.</li>
            <li> And forget any type of close shave, I was better off with the generic CVS brand one to get more options for closer shave.  </li>
            <li> It has a very ergonomic design which fits great in your hand and the blue part has a rubbery texture to it.</li>
            <li> Having so many different settings makes it more versatile than most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can quickly change lengths.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Could be more utilitarian for short hair if there were more settings-</li>
            <li> since soap dries quickly when you aren&#x27;t under the water.  </li>
            <li> The best thing of this device is that opening and cleaning the device is a matter of pulling various parts off, blowing air, then plugging it back together.</li>
            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t grab and cut the hair quickly</li>
            <li> bought this after reading so many reviews of trimmers on here and this seemed to get quite a few good reviews.</li>
            <li> On me, it will shorten it so that appears like a mild &amp;#34;5 O&#x27;clock shadow&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> is tremendous machine.</li>
            <li> Battery dies too quickly for manly men.</li>
            <li> Yes: frequent oiling is important for extending the life of most trimmers.  </li>
            <li> Really cuts my beard well and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Received quickly and comes with everything you need.</li>
            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t seem like the motor is moving as quickly, like</li>
            <li> Very easy to clear stubble and never looses its charge.</li>
            <li> I have seen high ratings for this product from many sources including &amp;quot;Men&#x27;s Journal&amp;quot;</li>
            <li> Outstanding product - adjustable settings gets the look you are going for - highly recommend this trimmer.</li>
            <li> Has a much better range of settings for a super close neat 5 o&#x27;clock shadow look then the 4 other trimers i own.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use, light, doesn&#x27;t vibrate your hand off, quiet, holds a charge, and trims my beard perfectly in just a few passes.</li>
            <li> The very first time I used this trimmer (was on 7.5mm setting)</li>
            <li> and I cannot say how very pleased I am overall.</li>
            <li> my husband is very pleased with all the different settings he can trim his beard with.</li>
            <li> Never in my history of doing business with Amazon have I experienced so many notifications of an item being purchased and shipped only to find the next day</li>
            <li> I use it primarily for removing body hair and found it to be pretty efficient.</li>
            <li> I tried two other options before this Panasonic, this is by far the best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> the cheap 20$ walmart junk I bought first.</li>
            <li> The instructions make it sound pretty high-maintenance, we&#x27;ll see how it goes.</li>
            <li> Great idea, and it works OK, but I have to go over the same area multiple times to get the hairs clipped.</li>
            <li> Keeps a good charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> I can confidently state that I will always own this trimmer or the closest version Panasonic has to offer well into the future, because my beard has never looked this good before with so little effort.</li>
            <li> So this beard trimmer is great at getting your hairs down to 10mm or shorter.</li>
            <li> A great trimmer for the shower, where all the hair goes down the drain instead of over the bathroom floor.  </li>
            <li> Shaves better than expected, very easy to set for correct beard length.</li>
            <li> It holds a charge for a long time, and the best thing is that it is super quiet.</li>
            <li> love this trimmer and use it much more often than I do my other shaver that gives you a smooth shave (I use both, depending on the look I want for the day).  </li>
            <li> Does tremendous work and very compact and comfortable , overall very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> Very well made, easy to use.</li>
            <li> It does a nice job with the facial follicles and has plenty of adjustments from sandpaper skin to full on hobo.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and is very versatile.  </li>
            <li> Cleans up easily without much effort, like that I can use in shower.</li>
            <li> Overall pretty good trimmer.</li>
            <li> , you could easily make the mistake the shaver is set to 10mm when it is really at 3mm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall</li>
            <li> I use it pretty much everywhere except for the top of my head.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic looks good, but does not live up to  </li>
            <li> beast mowed down a 4 week old &amp;#34;I-don&#x27;t-want-to-shave-because-owwies-will-happen-beard&amp;#34;, with the greatest of ease.  </li>
            <li> The shaver itself is perfect, but it only came with a full cradle for charging which is not very convenient for travelling</li>
            <li> Hope it will last many years!</li>
            <li> I wish he would use this, he is hot with scruff!</li>
            <li> He was so happy with this model that we simply stuck with it rather than trying out something new</li>
            <li> I chose this one and have enjoyed the variety of settings, it is quiet and cleans easily.  </li>
            <li> Love it easy to use and quiet.</li>
            <li> This is so easy to use, so many length choices and works well, a must have for anyone with a moderate beard.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s solidly built and very easy to clean, and the guard is built in</li>
            <li> /&gt;Trimming the weeks worth of growth was okay, it seemed to get pretty close, however it required multiple passes to make sure that an area was clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lot more convenient than my old, cheaper one, and I really like how easy it is to change the trimming length.</li>
            <li> Works well, just need to clean consistently</li>
            <li> quiet, powerful, durable, very easy to clean</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this is a great little trimmer.</li>
            <li> Great little bush wacker</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quiet and feels good in my rather large hands.</li>
            <li> The height adjustments are great and it is a powerful little unit.  </li>
            <li> This is a nice product, could use a little more power</li>
            <li> I feel pretty special.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very nice to use in the shower and not create a mess all over your counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> will up it to 5 if it is still working great after a few months.</li>
            <li> It is light weight and feels very sturdy.  </li>
            <li> Great trim, even in a heavy beard.</li>
            <li> Had used a much cheaper Remington trimmer before that needed a cheap repair.  </li>
            <li> The dial is legible, the movements are smooth, it is quiet, easy to clean and the parts and pieces fit together well.  </li>
            <li> The wet/dry design makes them safe to use on wet hair and make them easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Cuts smooth and fast without snagging.  </li>
            <li> it will result in a very close and precise buzz.</li>
            <li> It has plenty of length options, it&#x27;s comfortable in the hand, and it does a great job with my thick beard.</li>
            <li> The extension is very sturdy and accurate to 0.5mm</li>
            <li> Trimmer works fantastic is quiet and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> without the guard isn&#x27;t as smooth as some on the face, but that is what razors are for..best trimmer I have ever used.it lives on the charger, and it is made to not &#x27;over&#x27;-charge which is very convenient</li>
            <li> The clipper seems underpowered for doing sideburns, the attachment for adjusting how much to cut is cheap plastic.  </li>
            <li> Going back to a Norelco for a more comfortable groom.</li>
            <li> liked the design &amp; that it was quiet.</li>
            <li> It is very quiet compared to his old one and does a great job at shaving.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> This is a nice trimmer, so far I really like it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Powerful trimmer.</li>
            <li> I was able to extend it to 5mm and still get into the areas that I wanted to trim without any unexpected effort.</li>
            <li> It stays nice and short while still having it look like 5 o&#x27;clock shadow.</li>
            <li> Totally worth the money.  </li>
            <li> as expected, good value</li>
            <li> The design is awesome, but poorly executed.</li>
            <li> i had so much fun with this</li>
            <li> Worth the cost, and then some.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> product is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I do use this shaver to pre-shave my head and facial whiskers before hand shaving with a Gillette mechanical shaver to get the shine that I most enjoy.</li>
            <li> Worth the price and then some.  </li>
            <li> But worth the money.</li>
            <li> it is surely worth</li>
            <li> I own three different trimmers.</li>
            <li> I thought twice about paying the price, but this trimmer is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Given that Panasonic is one of the top two manufacturers of Nickel-metal hydride batteries in the world, I shouldn&#x27;t have been surprised.</li>
            <li> My old Panasonic trimmer was much better.</li>
            <li> My husband has issues with his skin that making shaving not so fun.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Hey, they tell me to be as honest as possible on these Vine reviews, so there it is.</li>
            <li> Does a nice job overall.</li>
            <li> The water-flow maintenance hole is pretty cool.</li>
            <li> handy-- Especially for a wet/dry trimmer!</li>
            <li> /&gt;As far as the charging stand goes, if you are someone that likes to keep things on top of your counter</li>
            <li> I would not buy this for regular price, and honestly if I had to replace it, I wouldn&#x27;t spend $59 on again either.  </li>
            <li> I tried 4 different trimmers before this one,  also has a nice weight on it.</li>
            <li> I had to replace a trimmer that must be 15 or more years old.</li>
            <li> So far I have enjoyed this item as I have almost everything I have ever purchased from Panasonic.</li>
            <li> This razor is the softest, quietest I&#x27;ve ever heard and it clearly does chop hair but if the manufacturer gave it MORE TORQUE</li>
            <li> Additionally, you can only charge it using the included charging dock, which is a nice touch and looks really nice, but it&#x27;s definitely a pain to pack when traveling.</li>
            <li> I was recommended this from a friend and is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Nice and quiet.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as powerful as is claimed and takes a while to trim your beard with the guard on&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> best face/body hair trimmer i&#x27;ve found, but still desperately needs a more powerful motor.</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> For the price it is worth it if you are on the market for  a body trimmer.</li>
            <li> Even after charging razor did not seem powerful and did not cut beard even.  </li>
            <li> Not even a case useful for travel.</li>
            <li> We actually returned one cause he loved this soo much</li>
            <li> It runs very quiet and trims nicely.</li>
            <li> The soft grip handle has a great feel and the trimmer itself is a quiet hum.</li>
            <li> have to admit, I&#x27;m not crazy about the recharging stand.  </li>
            <li> I hope that feature proves to be durable, but I like not having removable attachments.  </li>
            <li> Much better term than my old Phillips, which is saying a lot.</li>
            <li> i have tried a few brands before but this is the best so far.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t seem all too powerful.</li>
            <li> So many reviews out there list this as the best cordless beard trimmer, and it is so blatantly obvious that none of these reviewers have ever used it or ever used it on an actual beard grown from human hair.</li>
            <li> I would probably oil more frequently if I washed it with water each time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Although the construction of the item is solid and would have been nice</li>
            <li> And most importantly, it does cut quite well and is relatively silent.  </li>
            <li> None were worth the time.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> The charging station is pretty cool.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and high quality.</li>
            <li> however if you are looking to keep yourself looking like a nice European model, then you have found the right trimmer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad that I went with my gut on this one, some of the other reviews weren&#x27;t the best, there were a few complains about the charging.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll notice the trimmer itself is a bit narrower that most other trimmers, and while that means it may take more time to buzz</li>
            <li> He was SUPER impressed with all the settings and that it&#x27;s a Wet &amp; Dry trimmer &amp; shaver</li>
            <li> They are the best in the industry in my opinion, and this is due to several reasons: fast and relatively silent electric motor, capability of using them in both dry and wet mode, close shave, nicely engineered head and good to excellent overall quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I realized the settings on this razor vs the ones at my barbershop differ tremendously.  </li>
            <li> the end, like I mentioned at the top, this is a decent trimmer, but is nothing to write home about, and it is very overpriced.  </li>
            <li> No sound, nice grip, small so you can get best results.</li>
            <li> Good quality product, sharp &amp; well designed.</li>
            <li> It works good on beard and other areas, also.</li>
            <li> so I decided to add in my own two cents about how great this wet dry razor really is.</li>
            <li> I love the way it works and how easy it is to break down and clean under the faucet</li>
            <li> Hopefully the manual is right about it not overcharging.</li>
            <li> Something about it doesn&#x27;t seem quite right.  </li>
            <li> Right out of the box, the shaver was damaged and had to be returned for a replacement.</li>
            <li> If that sounds right to you</li>
            <li> The people at Panasonic got it right</li>
            <li> Used to fight with my shaver to get the right setting and or to keep it on the right setting.</li>
            <li> And all are right here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t feel right in my hand.  </li>
            <li> So as of right now I’m waiting for the oil to arrive before I can use the product.</li>
            <li> Just had to getting my beard trimming setting right.  </li>
            <li> I got the Panasonic after work today and  gave it a try right away.  </li>
            <li> The ez to use dial depth gauge makes finding the right hair length a breeze.</li>
            <li> but it does pop right off.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just going to trust that they&#x27;re right.</li>
            <li> right?</li>
            <li> For the face it does the job right.</li>
            <li> The micro adjustment on the height of the cut is especially well done and easy to fine tune.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is a huge upgrade from my older Remington trimmer.</li>
            <li> Power was minimal at best and it took a long time to trim my beard.</li>
            <li> Very adjustable and cuts cleanly.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s so much easier to clean with the way water can flow through it.</li>
            <li> Cleanup can be a real chore with some trimmers, but this one washes off clean in seconds.</li>
            <li> Love the .5mm adjustments, I use it to trim my beard and have pretty sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I really would not want to clean this thing out with brushes and compressed air.</li>
            <li> I have had many trimmers in the past, but this one is really nice.</li>
            <li> This shaver still feels like higher quality and still far better than the Norelco BodyGroom and Panasonic ER224s.  </li>
            <li> The first thing you notice on this trimmer is that its considerable longer than most devices like it.</li>
            <li> This easy clean-up was the most compelling reason I was attracted to the idea of \\&quot;wet shaving\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I think they had to take this approach to make it safe for use in the shower, but I much prefer the normal charging method of plugging something into the body of the shaver itself.  </li>
            <li> but of course when you go to use it, it trims like a beast, very easy, numerous guard settings.....................</li>
            <li> Great for daily beard trimming to just that right tight trim level for the slightly more than stubble</li>
            <li> Otherwise, its fantastic and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> the cutter head pops off and re-inserts easily, with no small parts to break or weaken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Apparently, technology should run on fairy dust and magical rainbow farts or something.</li>
            <li> Apparently, technology should run on fairy dust and magical rainbow farts or something.</li>
            <li> This machines blade is small and it really isn&#x27;t great...</li>
            <li> However, we have had great service from Panasonic products in the past</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had several shavers by various manufacturers, and this has been the best so far.</li>
            <li> first thing I used it for was to trim the 2 weeks worth of growth that I had, and then to get my goatee even.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a couple of times, but it is so far the best facial trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> &gt;  Simple &amp; ergonomic design makes it easy to operate!</li>
            <li> The adjustability is quite fine tuned, in increments of .5mm (wow!).  </li>
            <li> The adjustability is quite fine tuned, in increments of .5mm (wow!).  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s dirt simple and cleans easily!  </li>
            <li> Even the first two years and a half was awesome, time to change it on the third anniversary.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> This is easy to use, easy to clean, and allows me to trim down the spots that need trimming.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and works well so far</li>
            <li> Very solidly constructed and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> You can easily change the length (I always use the shortest length) and they are completely water resistant.</li>
            <li> Simple to operate and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> The dial allows you to easily and clearly select the comb length.  </li>
            <li> The Panasonic is easy to clean and oil for proper preventative maintenance.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really easy to clean, and it feels relatively solid, but the fact that the instructions tell you to oil the blades before each &amp; every use makes me wonder just how durable this</li>
            <li> The good is that the trimmer settings work well and don&#x27;t slip from one setting to another as has happened with a previous trimmer.</li>
            <li> and I love it will wear everyday and show off to everyone that asks, plan on ordering more...</li>
            <li> Fairly quiet, great range of thickness, and all in all just a terrific product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to remove the comb and expose the blade directly.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it much yet, but so far am extremely pleased with it.</li>
            <li> The charge is a bit flimsy, but the trimmer fits nicely in it&#x27;s place and the charger doesn&#x27;t take any real abuse, so it may last for years.</li>
            <li> I own mine over a year &amp; just bought this one for my teenage son because I like mine so much (&amp; he keeps taking mine).</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, my previous experience was with the \\&quot;Remington Titanium\\&quot; trimmer, and I loved it, but the battery stopped charging</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does tend to get whiskers lodged in the guard, but it&#x27;s easy enough to pop off and clean.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the quick mail out.</li>
            <li> Pretty simple on this; it fits the hand nicely, the head isn&#x27;t overly large so you can pop off the attachment and do detail work, and the motor provides ample power to clip hair</li>
            <li> The trimmer cuts my goatee fine, but requires more maintenance than any other razor I have had.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a special water port specifically designed for rinsing - so far, not helping tremendously.</li>
            <li> I got it pretty quick, very light weight and holds a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is maybe a good product for a man who wants to maintain a two-day stubble of a chin or has a goatee, but it&#x27;s not good for anything more than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This reduces the opportunity for pinched hair for folks with particularly coarse facial hair, although I don&#x27;t know many people with fine facial hair--so this might be a completely negligible consideration for most but the final point is that this trimmer will be less-likely to pinch hair and more apt to provide an even trim with fewer passes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> very light weight and stays charged for several uses</li>
            <li> Yes I like it very much.</li>
            <li> Would very much recommend for trim and travel.&lt;br /&gt;Get</li>
            <li> The guard is also very comfortable to run across your face unlike my last trimmer.</li>
            <li> The length adjuster (how close of a shave you want) is very precise from 1 mm up to 10mm, although I actually take the adjuster off and trim it to...</li>
            <li> It is Rechargable, quiet, lightweight and very comfortable to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t</li>
            <li> 10mm is not very long, so look elsewhere if you want more like 1/4in</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom Line - this is a really good beard trimmer that feels nice in the hand, and offers excellent precision and cutting ability for regularly maintained beards.for regularly maintained beards.</li>
            <li> This is a good little rechargeable trimmer.</li>
            <li> You can use it in water, but my charger broke after the first charging.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re constantly running it through water, would you need to reapply oil more?</li>
            <li> It has a fast, powerful motor.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is much better quality than the body trimmer I had prior</li>
            <li> I tried it on my arm first</li>
            <li> Did exactly what it said it would and priced well</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE:  The first one I bought broke within a week-</li>
            <li> density)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am willing to accept it may be me and not the trimmer</li>
            <li> It was exactly what he was looking for.  </li>
            <li> after getting married I started trimming my beard in the shower to keep from getting hair all over the sink.  </li>
            <li> hours for first charge.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My one dislike is that the recharging light stays on constantly and you are never quite sure when the battery is completely charge.  </li>
            <li> Exceeded expectations up to this point if it doesn&#x27;t tear up and will last :)</li>
            <li> but then perhaps I had higher expectations.</li>
            <li> Charged it abroad the first time w/o noticing it</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time after I got it yesterday.</li>
            <li> Overall its okay</li>
            <li> Quote: Before returning to the seller, contact Panasonic first).</li>
            <li> Fantastic shave; quiet, precise and very well made.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this item!!</li>
            <li> Pretty inconsistent machine.</li>
            <li> I ordered a second pair for my brother and we both love it.</li>
            <li> I can only use it one time and then it needs to be recharged, I wish it had acted up during the first 30 days, for sure</li>
            <li> Been through so many similar types of trimmers and this thing is just designed well.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space and it&#x27;s pretty user-friendly.</li>
            <li> This is my fourth Panasonic shaver, and I love all of them....</li>
            <li> Better luck next year</li>
            <li> Love that you can leave trimmer on recharger and not have to worry about it only being plugged in for 90 minutes or it will ruin trimmer.  </li>
            <li> If I had a full thick beard I&#x27;d have no doubt that when it seems to drop in power it would struggle more to give a quick and clean cut.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what I want it for.  </li>
            <li> Consistent performance.</li>
            <li> I believe this is the first time I have ever written a product review.</li>
            <li> Seems to do exactly what advertised.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have the ability to collect hair within the body like my prior shaver had, but I still like this more.</li>
            <li> I had charged the trimmer about 18 hours overnight before first use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say this beard trimmer does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what I want it to do and does it well.</li>
            <li> I had higher expectations for this product.  </li>
            <li> Holds charge pretty well</li>
            <li> This is a very well made trimmer!  </li>
            <li> I only wish that it could have more than a 10mm range.</li>
            <li> I do wish the head was a bit smaller for more even strokes, as sometimes going perpendicular to the jawline can lead to a shorter cut just under the jaw.</li>
            <li> it is the first time I charged and do not work.....</li>
            <li> Works pretty well.</li>
            <li> Does it&#x27;s job exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li> 0,5mm steps helps getting better control over the short length.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Found myself with a beard for the first time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been almost a year and no complaints, he really likes it, thank goodness for both of us!</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t vouch for how it works in the shower, or trims while wet as I have not used it in that capacity yet, but I can say that my beard always looks nicely groomed.</li>
            <li> When charged it works, but battery is worth a whole heck of a lot.</li>
            <li> The adjustable comb works exactly as it should: it determines how close to the skin the clipper will clip.</li>
            <li> Lots of settings, works well, easy to clean, long battery life.</li>
            <li> I love the color personally and would buy this for my brother if he didn&#x27;t already have one!</li>
            <li> My first beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> Higher quality than the price would suggest.</li>
            <li> First of all, while you don&#x27;t have to worry about sharpening the blade, the instructions say you should oil it before and after each use.  </li>
            <li> This beard trimmer works exactly as it should and</li>
            <li> and I am not sorry I bought it.</li>
            <li> And mostly I&#x27;d like my money back.</li>
            <li> First is I wish it had a display with the battery percentage remaining.</li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t the first person that happened to.  </li>
            <li> you would a stylus (and it&#x27;d be self-oiling ;) )&lt;</li>
            <li> so my beard ended up shorter than in tended, and the intervals were higher as well.</li>
            <li> The head blocks hairs more than it picks them up and a shave requires multiple passes to get all the</li>
            <li> funny thing is that even the Panasonic website doesn&#x27;t market this device as a \\&quot;body groomer\\&quot; but Amazon&#x27;s website does.  </li>
            <li> my first trial in the shower I tried shaving \\&quot;wet\\&quot; WITHOUT any liquid body wash.  </li>
            <li> Same results on the hair on top of my head.</li>
            <li> only thing is it needs more accessories</li>
            <li> I actually really like this!  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe the first time it did that as I&#x27;ve NEVER had</li>
            <li> first.</li>
            <li> He absolutely loves it!  </li>
            <li> Very convenient!</li>
            <li> I used this trimmer for the first time today.  </li>
            <li> Love the fact that it can be used in the shower and you don&#x27;t have to fumble with exchanging or storing a bunch of different sized trim head pieces.  </li>
            <li> The mini foil attachment on this unit is EXACTLY what I needed.  </li>
            <li> The depth adjustment is convenient and calibrated to allow a consistent trim.</li>
            <li> also love the fact that it has 19 settings, allowing me to keep my facial hair trimmed the exact length I want it to be.</li>
            <li> pretty and waterproof!&lt;br /&gt;from</li>
            <li> Now I can shave him in a very short time &amp; he is more relaxed.</li>
            <li> There are so many settings, so you know you will definitely find the length you need, no matter what</li>
            <li> I love the way I can adjust the shaver head for various depths of shave.</li>
            <li> It does cut okay, but it feels like it doesn&#x27;t always have enough</li>
            <li> love that you don&#x27;t need to replace plastic parts if you want a different level trim, you just turn the adjustable dial.  </li>
            <li> Works great, just not able to get a very close shave.</li>
            <li> important to me, though, is the level of precision this Panasonic Trimmer offers.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s exactly what the instructions suggest.  </li>
            <li> If you dig around in the instructions for most trimmers, they will say the same thing.  </li>
            <li> It is nice that it can be used wet.</li>
            <li> This is my first beard trimmer</li>
            <li> first thing I noticed about the Panasonic was that, when fully charged, it sounded just like my Remington did when the battery was about to die.</li>
            <li> This is the first product I&#x27;ve been burned on and the first Panasonic product I&#x27;ve ever bought.</li>
            <li> I have tried several over the years and this one is at the top of my list.  </li>
            <li> I only got this for my precious coin sack, it didn&#x27;t work there..</li>
            <li> Ergonomically designed and much more quiet than the Remington.  </li>
            <li> can&#x27;t comment on the battery life because I have not had the need to recharge it since the first 24hr charge.&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li> Not a bunch of clip on depth attachments.&lt;br /&gt;You can use in it the shower and wash it with hot water after using it so</li>
            <li> Even on the first shave it snags and pulls.</li>
            <li> First, the adjustable comb that has 19 length settings.  </li>
            <li> Good power when doing heavy trimming too.</li>
            <li> Requires a few repetition to get a good shave.</li>
            <li> So far so good, just have to see how long it holds up.</li>
            <li> Basically, if I want to trim my beard I have to set aside a weekend day to give it a few passes until it looks good.</li>
            <li> It is easy to clean and oil, and easy to adjust, though I have to say that I&#x27;ve done very little in the way of maintenance.</li>
            <li> Great for keeping the facial hair tight and clean.</li>
            <li> With this item i feel like you get all the utility of a super high end tool in the palm of your hand.</li>
            <li> , I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased, this was a flat out terrific buy as well ... !&lt;</li>
            <li> The fact that it is so easy to do and easy to clean makes it only a mild annoyance and since I&#x27;m not aware of clippers of this style that don&#x27;t need oil, I&#x27;m not going to take any stars away.  </li>
            <li> in all, I think this is a very good product for BODY GROOMING with the only real recommendation being that a little more TORQUE to the motor may help cut those pesky hairs on the first go-around versus having to hit them from multiple angles.  </li>
            <li> other than that it is a nice trimmer</li>
            <li> The dial adjust feature is particularly nice and easier than some other trimmers that have to be pushed either direction to adjust.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy so far, if it makes it past 4 months it&#x27;ll be worth the cost.</li>
            <li> Or I could choose one of the other 17 settings to get my own custom</li>
            <li> So of all the trimmers out there that claim to work in water, I would say this is by FAR the best - between the incredibly specific lengths you can adjust to and the fact that its clearly built for wet use, I&#x27;d say its 100% worth the money.  </li>
            <li> Plus it&#x27;s easy to clean as it can get wet.</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer after my old Norelco quit because of the reviews and the ability to clean it under the faucet.  </li>
            <li> The hairs seem to clog the grooves in the comb over the blades, preventing the blades from reaching the beard, so you have to clean it frequently.</li>
            <li> I have thick facial hair and the trimmer works great!</li>
            <li> The battery life is really good and the trimmer has several different length settings.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Adjusts many increments up to 19mm or about 3/4 inch, which means even &amp;#62;1&amp;#34; thick beards may be OK because of the way the comb works.</li>
            <li> All the multiple setting suggest it is more versatile than it really is.</li>
            <li> I really hope there is something better out there with similar features</li>
            <li> The Good part is my beard was all the same length and all of the whiskers were the same length.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Be sure to use it above the 1.5mm setting unless you really want your trim &amp;#34;tight.&amp;#34</li>
            <li> This is a really good rechargeable beard trimmer intended for regularly maintained beard or facial hair.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, this is a good trimmer, for little money, and it gets the job done!</li>
            <li> Was pretty let down to be honest.</li>
            <li> My old trimmer had three settings and this one has many more, so it was a little trial and error on that, but no problem at all.</li>
            <li> Easy to adjust the settings and pretty quiet.</li>
            <li> For every positive this razor has a negative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and the positive ones were spot on.  </li>
            <li> The unit worked very well the first year.</li>
            <li> Took too much off the first time but works well</li>
            <li> Consistent trimming is so much easier with its dial adjustment.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really cut my beard consistently.</li>
            <li> The Wahl trimmer never seemed to hold a charge very well, though it cut pretty well.</li>
            <li> Have been pleased with the product so far.  much quieter than the 5 year old trimmer it&#x27;s replacing.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The razor didn&#x27;t seem extremely powerful but maybe that is because it is very quiet and doesn&#x27;t vibrate significantly.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d replace the whole item first.</li>
            <li> trimmer does exactly what it&#x27;s suppose to do and does it very well.</li>
            <li> and you can pretty much shave with it</li>
            <li> Loved the product, but after the first charge ran out (it lasted a long time, because I only used it about once a week to trim up my beard)</li>
            <li> Usually they don&#x27;t impress me as good or bad--just a tool.</li>
            <li> not bad so far.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the ease of cleaning, though never really a chore--Panasonic made it even simpler to clean.  </li>
            <li> It worked fine for a brief time when first purchased but is unserviceable now.</li>
            <li> my husband who is its main user and long-time beard grower:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have owned several hair and beard trimmers over the years and this is my favorite.  </li>
            <li> I will buy a different one next time but this one was the right price and had a lot of adjustment notches which is nice.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is very easy to use, very ergonomic like their shavers which I have been partial to for years.</li>
            <li> This works great, trims as expected, however be careful if you set the trim dial too low, you can trim more than you expect.  </li>
            <li> I originally purchased this item from a different company that guaranteed it for life and charged more than double the Amazon price plus shipping charges.</li>
            <li> It is very versatile, but if you&#x27;re one to keep some very detailed lines you need to be pretty careful with this.</li>
            <li> Quiet and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and has multiple adjustment settings (1 to 10 w/.5 incr.) to choose from.</li>
            <li> I took a chance buying this for my husband, since he&#x27;s very particular about how he shaves.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t remove guard, will not cut short hairs easily.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s an actual funnel where you run running water to get under the blade for easy cleaning, then you disassemble for sufficient aerating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s an actual funnel where you run running water to get under the blade for easy cleaning, then you disassemble for sufficient aerating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah</li>
            <li> Very quick and quiet.</li>
            <li> The clean-up with the Panasonic is easy as you simply hold it under a stream from your shower head.  </li>
            <li> The dial up length setting is easy to use and built to last.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Based on other reviews, I was excited to get the Panasonic as it looked like it would fit the bill and meet  </li>
            <li> You could easily go from beard to hair in just a second by rotating the rolling wheel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Super loud.  </li>
            <li> It looks cool, works great, can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> Silent, strong, quality product.</li>
            <li> My beard might look a little short for the first couple of days, but I&#x27;m a happy guy.</li>
            <li> The adjustable guard will not let you trim defined lines which I feel is a large part of trimming.</li>
            <li> The large number of settings allows for any desired height.</li>
            <li> That is certainly an annoyance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> I always used one certain norelco trimmer, and then they stopped selling them.</li>
            <li> This model is certainly tuned toward a close trimmed beard.</li>
            <li> Wet dry feature makes it easy to use in shower and also easy to clean.</li>
            <li> They should have spent more time and money on functionality and REAL power versus making it look pretty.</li>
            <li> you want a well built, smooth running machine, go buy one right away; the strange design will either grow on you, or you will not care about it after you see how well the machine runs.</li>
            <li> you better oil it or it will loose rpm and will not cut as well.</li>
            <li> Works great wet or dry and never had it run out of power.  </li>
            <li> The adjustments are great and works well dry and wet.</li>
            <li> Works great wet or dry.</li>
            <li> Any shaver that can be used in water is a great shaver &amp; all mine are wet dry.</li>
            <li> Works well, cleans easy and is very ergonomic and quiet.  </li>
            <li> Adjusting the depth of cut is easy and cleaning is fast and simple.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend and the price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> With the last trimmer I bought, it came with a whole bag full of different trimming head attachments, most of which were just used to change the length of hair it trimmed.</li>
            <li> so you can leave it on its dock full time other than that it&#x27;s fantastic</li>
            <li> actually like the comb, it feels fine against my face and doesn&#x27;t scratch.  </li>
            <li> And I just can&#x27;t describe what it&#x27;s like going from the retrospectively coarse trimming of the Wahl&#x27;s to this fine trimming machine.  </li>
            <li> And I just can&#x27;t describe what it&#x27;s like going from the retrospectively coarse trimming of the Wahl&#x27;s to this fine trimming machine.  </li>
            <li> First off, the build quality is better than any other trimmer I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> So if you&#x27;re really particular about the exact length of your beard, then this one should give all the control</li>
            <li> The unit is waterproof so I can use it in the shower (a must for me) and is made of very high quality.  </li>
            <li> This is a very high quality razor.</li>
            <li> This little guy is amazing.</li>
            <li> I think the power is a little lacking and that could be a cause of catching hair as well.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used it I just set it high and worked my way to the setting that worked for me.  </li>
            <li> and it was a little more powerful for a faster haircut.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d expect any rechargeable device to tell me how much charge remains; either graphically or with a simple warning light, but this trimmer does not.</li>
            <li> and simple adjustments for a huge range of lengths.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quiet, fast and accurate.</li>
            <li> the dial to adjust the cut length&lt;br /&gt;No tug or pull&lt;br /&gt;Not to light that it feels cheap, but not to heavy that it is clunky</li>
            <li> Panasonic has a huge range of simple settings, to trim stubble or beards to any desired length.</li>
            <li> Really wanted to like this trimmer.  </li>
            <li> cuz it&#x27;s fast and cuts well.</li>
            <li> VERY SATISFIED.DOES</li>
            <li> However, the mechanism for attaching the clipper guard isn&#x27;t really durable.  </li>
            <li> Built in adjust ability is very convenient.</li>
            <li> [Pros] Only 1 Attachment for 19 adjustable settings (!!!), waterproof (!!!), ergonomic, powerful enough to not require too many swipes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But 95% of these complaints I&#x27;m seeing really aren&#x27;t legitimate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Really?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s able to be used WET.</li>
            <li> Too much work for you?</li>
            <li> So... let me get this straight</li>
            <li> So... let me get this straight</li>
            <li> I purchased this item for my husband and he absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li> No signs of rust, so it really is a stainless steel blade.</li>
            <li> It trims well and holds a charge very well.</li>
            <li> but no so much for hair.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this unit!</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> My husband has a mustache and beard that he keeps groomed very well.  </li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband and he really loves it.  </li>
            <li> Works really well.</li>
            <li> This does the job really well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve left it plugged in for hours and the light doesn&#x27;t come on, and</li>
            <li> the 1mm setting really works for my beard.  </li>
            <li> Very sturdy trimmer with lots of levels to choose from.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Wahl trimmers over the years because they simply were the ones that were available.</li>
            <li> Which at that point, the red light in front goes out and you are supposed to unplug the power cord from the wall.</li>
            <li> Well here I am, a week and a day after plugging it in and its still charging (red light is still on).</li>
            <li> I am really trying to like this razor; it will do the job, but I use this in conjunction with my Braun</li>
            <li> Really doesn&#x27;t trim hair all the well.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t line very well at all</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> WOW powerful tool</li>
            <li> Really fast shipping</li>
            <li> Hubby loves it and very versatile.</li>
            <li> The red light battery indicator is no longer on.</li>
            <li> PRO&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;- Stainless blades, just rinse off in the water, no rust&lt;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a beard trimmer that hurts so much, haha.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Who makes a wet/dry shaver that requires that much oiling?  </li>
            <li> It really is a one pass trim.</li>
            <li> Light is just always on and same color when charging.</li>
            <li> This did not have much power and did not do the job.  </li>
            <li> I is hand and it has a quiet sound when it works, and the.</li>
            <li> The unit has a short trimming area (about an inch) which allows for precise trimming.  </li>
            <li> It is also very quiet and smooth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The comb/guard detaches if you want to trim something really close.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking to do haircuts, its also mighty enough to do that, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend doing yourself.</li>
            <li> and it died so we needed it replaced, he absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very well made.</li>
            <li> Works Very well.</li>
            <li> He really likes this one, and when (or if) it does die...</li>
            <li> I highly suggest this trimmer for anyone looking!</li>
            <li> It does a much faster job than this.</li>
            <li> works really well in water or out.  </li>
            <li> As a homosexual man it&#x27;s important to stay groomed, but this product is a definite no.</li>
            <li> It makes trimming by beard and mustache much easier</li>
            <li> I have used it twice and it cuts very well.</li>
            <li> It works really well.</li>
            <li> Body grooming performs as expected, but I&#x27;ve worked with better wired versions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My husband really likes this.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s lightweight and works very well in or out of the shower.</li>
            <li> If there this cheap with a $3 plastic part, I can only imagine what&#x27;s it like with a tv.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t really complain.</li>
            <li> This is a very well designed piece of equipment.  </li>
            <li> Really like the adjust-ability in the shave.</li>
            <li> My only disappointment with this product is that the charger light does not extinguish once charging is completed otherwise it is a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> Maybe I am expecting too much from a beard trimmer, but I feel like this product&#x27;s performance is sub-par.</li>
            <li> paid 1/2 as much as the price that I saw in a fancy shaving store</li>
            <li> this is ok but not really fast</li>
            <li> No matter how much oil I put on the blade,it seems to pinch a hair or two.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bit worried about continued use, as I&#x27;m not too thorough with the whole oiling thing, but it hasn&#x27;t fallen apart on me yet.</li>
            <li> I really like this trimmer.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There is no way to tell how much charge is in the battery of the clipper.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t trim very evenly and takes way longer than my Oster ever did.</li>
            <li> If they would update this product with a modern Li cell, would be 5 stars.</li>
            <li> This beard trimmer is even better than I expected.</li>
            <li> I really like the simplicity of the trim height selector.</li>
            <li> My only quibble is its somewhat cheap feel.</li>
            <li> The one thing I did not like about the stand is that is has this red light that comes on to indicate it is charging.  </li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> I EXPECTED MORE FOR THE PRICE.</li>
            <li> motor on this is very quite.  </li>
            <li> Cleaning it up couldn&#x27;t be easier, just run the whole thing under water.  </li>
            <li> This will not give you a completely smooth shave, but it will keep your facial hair neat and trimmed.</li>
            <li> Isn&#x27;t that all you really need to know?  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband for Christmas and he absolutely LOVES this.</li>
            <li> Does the trick (at 5mm) at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Love the fact it can get wet.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t expect to get much help.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Very unimpressed.</li>
            <li> all shavers, this one really, really needs a carrying case.  </li>
            <li> This trimmer works very well.</li>
            <li> He really likes it.</li>
            <li> I replaced a Wahl trimmer with this Panasonic and I am much happier with it.</li>
            <li> Real problem is the battery life.</li>
            <li> If you want to keep a very close beard/body hair this will work for you.</li>
            <li> If you are considering a trimmer this one works very well.</li>
            <li> Works really well.</li>
            <li> This is too much of a pain.</li>
            <li> Works really well.  </li>
            <li> This thing has a really low-quality blade that crushes hairs and splits them.</li>
            <li> but it was no worse for the wear.  </li>
            <li> By the end you really do just want it OVER as 45 minutes under the water makes you feel like a water mammal.</li>
            <li> He says that it shaves very close.  </li>
            <li> It is really a one-pass trimmer, thus saving time.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend, husband loves it!</li>
            <li> Finally a trimmer that doesn&#x27;t feel cheap...</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, it does neither very well.  </li>
            <li> thing I really don&#x27;t like is the &amp;#34;stand&amp;#34; it doesn&#x27;t just plug in you need to get a stand out and charge it in a stand.</li>
            <li> For the reputation of the manufacturer and the cost of the device, I expected more.</li>
            <li> I really have no intention of using it in the shower</li>
            <li> He tells me repeatedly that  he really likes the trim settings and the control he has with the unit.  </li>
            <li> Now I really like this trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Very high-maintenance</li>
            <li> , way too much oiling</li>
            <li> It is really designed for closer cuts.  </li>
            <li> actually shaven smooth</li>
            <li> I also had to put oil on it very often.</li>
            <li> Really likt it.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to worry much about changing the blades all the time, also you can use it in the shower.</li>
            <li> Really.</li>
            <li> that would be a con except that I think it&#x27;s pretty normal for this style of cutter to need that.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This trimmer works really well.</li>
            <li> The wet/dry feature is also very convenient and lets me wash the product easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s water proof and charges fast.</li>
            <li> I wish one can charge the trimmer while using it; otherwise, it&#x27;s very functional.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a couple of weeks, but have found it to be quite comfortable in my hand.  </li>
            <li> This was really disappointing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Panasonic just confirmed that the battery life is only two years.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it for shaving (I use a razor blade for the areas I want to straight shave)</li>
            <li> I really like the adjustable comb, and the capability to use it in the shower.</li>
            <li> Also, it is very substantial with a sturdy grip.</li>
            <li> Having said that, it&#x27;s really up to you.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to have much power, and you are supposed to take it apart to oil it after every use.</li>
            <li> Seems very well made.</li>
            <li> so I really can&#x27;t compare it to anything else.  </li>
            <li> Really?)</li>
            <li> So don&#x27;t expect a fast job.</li>
            <li> Does the job very well.</li>
            <li> Although it has a lot of plastic parts it seams very reliable.</li>
            <li> Not helpful when you&#x27;re trying to get ready for work in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> I cannot comment on all the settings because I do not use them, but I am very heppy with it for how I use it.</li>
            <li> It really gets the job done.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t found that it really has any impact on the performance of the shaver when this happens.</li>
            <li> Product is better than I expected.</li>
            <li> I really like the water port for cleaning.  </li>
            <li> I bought it not expecting to much</li>
            <li> Guess depends how much you use it.</li>
            <li> It takes too much space in the sink.</li>
            <li> Very well made..</li>
            <li> This shaver does have several shaving levels which is nice, especially for beard/sideburn trimming.</li>
            <li> My only critism is that it takes 24 hours to charge this thing when you first get it and 15 hours each full recharge afterward.</li>
            <li> trimmer completely solves that with its ingenious &#x27;dial a length&#x27; (my fancy technical term) built in guard.  </li>
            <li> The adjustable wheel is cool but takes some getting used to, I trimmed my beard way too short the first time.</li>
            <li> The best I could manage was to go really slowly and carefully - any speedy movements an</li>
            <li> partner has a plug in trimmer that doesn&#x27;t have any kind of guard or length attachments on it at all, and I&#x27;ve actually hurt myself on it multiple times.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, I would recommend a clipper like the Remington Titanium Precision Pro instead because it offers greater flexibility for different lengths of hair.  </li>
            <li> love the different levels this offers.</li>
            <li> Expect to spend quite a bit of time hitting the same spot over and over again until it actually gives you a nice even trim.</li>
            <li> So far, so good after using for a few months.</li>
            <li> Its portable, fits cofortably in your hand and is very accurate &amp; sharp.  </li>
            <li> Very precise adjustments and sharp blades.</li>
            <li> Very Well-made and very useful on all kinds of  trimming, especially beards and mustaches!</li>
            <li> is that it is not a smart battery system and chargerit could be so much better if it would turn itself off when charging was finished</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve now used this about 4 times and my wife says WOW!!!</li>
            <li> Surprised Panasonic did not slip a mini-radio in the handle???!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve paid a lot more for trimmers that were not nearly as good or as easy to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bit disappointed, but I guess I had overarching ideas of how quickly I could get a perfect &amp;#34;#6&amp;#34; throughout my face.</li>
            <li> I was fortunate enough to be able to purchase this during one of Amazon&#x27;s deal of the day and based on other reviews, I jumped in on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> which isn&#x27;t a major deal as I clean up with a normal razor w/ cream.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The trimmer charges quickly and the little charging station is easy to use and doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s always going to tip over like some brands</li>
            <li> I guess the old sayings right.</li>
            <li> Threw out my old one right away.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak to any other trimmers, but my son, whose beard can get very bushy but looks much better when it&#x27;s neatly trimmed, loves this trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Good enough to overlook the other two issues.</li>
            <li> This shaver is easily adjustable to varying lengths, but it&#x27;s not so easy that you&#x27;d accidentally adjust the length and lop off that hard earned beard.</li>
            <li> They cut cleanly, and don&#x27;t pull the hair out, and the dial is very cool, so you can make small adjustments.  </li>
            <li> First one was a very old panasonic one which used to always get stuck</li>
            <li> Worked fine for a week, now whirs around loudly and barely trims hair.</li>
            <li> I had to buy another buzzer I wouldn&#x27;t buy this one, but I&#x27;m not disappointed enough to go through the process of returning it.</li>
            <li> -- You do not have to oil this any more than any other trimmer, unless of course you are washing away the oil</li>
            <li> -- You do not have to oil this any more than any other trimmer, unless of course you are washing away the oil</li>
            <li> Most other body trimmers come with schlocky snap on plastic caps to adjust the closeness of the trim.  </li>
            <li> Pretty sure I&#x27;m going to lose that little brush in a week</li>
            <li> i also love the fact that the trimmer adjusts in 0.5 mm increments whereas other trimmers jump by 1.5 mm at some increments.</li>
            <li> I doubt other ones are much better.</li>
            <li> it costs a lil more than the other trimmers, bt</li>
            <li> Easy to clean and battery last a long time.</li>
            <li> Prefer the adjustment on this shaver over the yucky attachments that seemingly gets lost with most other shavers.</li>
            <li> I tried so many other ones with no luck.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know, because it shaves OK, as does every other product I try.</li>
            <li> Neither worked much better than the other.  </li>
            <li> But it works well every other time, and I am glad I got it.</li>
            <li> Panasonic has done the comb design much better than some other brands.  </li>
            <li> Great trimmer, not sure how much you &#x27;actually&#x27;  have to oil it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it for about a week, and I&#x27;ll update if anything significant happens.</li>
            <li> Upon receipt I observed that it is very lightweight, very modern, sleek and masculine looking.  </li>
            <li> It shaves decently, but I didn&#x27;t expect much to begin with.</li>
            <li> The only CON is that you have to take apart the blade assembly to clean and oil it.  </li>
            <li> the kind they sell on tv for getting the little hairs off your neck), actually does a better job at trimming my facial hairs.  </li>
            <li> Its light, powerful, quiet and does a great job cutting hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this for a few weeks but the trimmer works very well so far and the variable length settings are great.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product highly and it is reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> This is a very versatile, high quality trimmer that I have no problem giving the highest recommendation.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, does a good job of cutting the hairs uniformly, and the selector gives you a lot of options by the 1/2 mm.</li>
            <li> His facial hair grows SUPER FAST</li>
            <li> I really like the fact that this trimmer is quickly adjustable in 0.5mm steps without having to fool with different attachments.  </li>
            <li> The hair frees itself from the comb area pretty easily and washes down the drain.  </li>
            <li> to say though, the trimmer arrived pre charged and held that charge for a mighty long time...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Probably the only thing that really annoys me is that the indicator light on the charger doesn&#x27;t change when charging is complete.</li>
            <li> This wacko design is the only reason for which they are not getting the full 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Other than that, its a solid product and stands true to whatever it says on the description.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my 18 year old son to use for his first year in college during his \\&quot;No Shave</li>
            <li> The small blow out port or rinse out port is a nice feature.  </li>
            <li> It also works well doing a full pass from the back of my neck to my cheek and chin area.</li>
            <li> It holds a charge good for body not really good for face or precision.</li>
            <li> Cuts very well head hair but have not used it on facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;Charge is more than enough for a trim.</li>
            <li> I didnt care for this at 1st, but, after a few tries it grew on me and it actually does an excellent job</li>
            <li> None of my old ones would do that after the first month of use...</li>
            <li> So far this trimmer is pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s not really a complaint since it cuts really well.  </li>
            <li> It is quiet, solidly built and runs very smoothly.</li>
            <li> The only thing I miss from my old one is a pop up blade for fine trimming of sideburns, etc.</li>
            <li> So, most of the year, I &amp;#34;shave&amp;#34; from my jawline down with a trimmer.</li>
            <li> I have to make too many passes to cut my beard down to get an even look.</li>
            <li> This is much better than previous trimmers I&#x27;ve used because I would lose some of the trimmer heads.</li>
            <li> The trimmer was OK while it lasted, which was about half a year.&lt;br /&gt;Products may break, it happens, and this one supposedly has warranty.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> The fact that it can get wet assures cleaning is easy</li>
            <li> Works much better than the Wahl trimmer I had previously.</li>
            <li> This is just more of a slight inconvenience than anything.  </li>
            <li> This trimmer works much better for tidying up between haircuts on my son and husband that the previous trimmer I owned, which required changing attachments for each length.  </li>
            <li> Way better then my previous trimmer.</li>
            <li> His older groomer was wearing out and I found this on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Most trimmers require going over the same spots multiple times, but not this one.</li>
            <li> How many clippers can you take in the shower and use on a daily basis that last like this?</li>
            <li> I thought that I did not want to go above 3 MM&#x27;s , but luckily I tried it at 3 MM&#x27;s just to try it</li>
            <li> I had the older version of this for years.  </li>
            <li> actually i have tried many different razor shavers</li>
            <li> Holds a decent charge.</li>
            <li> I used a different brand of shaver for several years... that worked, but the Panasonic Milano shaver is much better.  </li>
            <li> (i have 4mm shaved sides) and it works great for my thick asian hair.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li> I love that this shaver has multiple settings such as 2.0, 2.5 length for those days</li>
            <li> --I have a fairly coarse beard and mustache and it takes many passes to even out my beard, and I still touch up with scissors after spending a solid 10-15 minutes using the trimmer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve traveled with it for up to a week without the charger, using it for a very short time every day, so it seems to hold an adequate charge for my needs.</li>
            <li> Dont get a razor straight line when trimming  my moustache,my old Norelco was much better,wish they still made it.</li>
            <li> This trimmer can be used in the shower, which might be a plus for some, but the main plus for me is that it does what it is supposed to.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many different brands of low cost trimmers.  </li>
            <li> Feels like it was made with care, using decent parts.</li>
            <li> The 3rd time I opened it for cleaning and oiling, 2 tiny metal pieces that somehow hold the top  razor plate in place, popped out and fell on the counter.  </li>
            <li> I replaced an older Norelco that did EVERTHING</li>
            <li> I have moderately thick/stiff facial hair and even without the guard the trimmer often struggles and takes way too many passes to cut everything</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re trying to trim a specific pattern in your facial hair, a cordless model like this one would give you a lot more</li>
            <li> * Decent price&lt;br /</li>
            <li> For the most part, all the extra features (comb attachments, easy to clean with water, etc.) are irrelevant to me, and I&#x27;ve yet to really test them out.  </li>
            <li> I use this trimmer mainly for my moustache and goatee.  </li>
            <li> i think it would have been pretty easy to make a little slot on the charging station to store the brush.</li>
            <li> Extremely well made, the trimming level set by mm ensures that I can quickly trim my &#x27;stache and &#x27;burns at the right level every day in a jiff.</li>
            <li> I use it several times each week and get a very consistent result.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to spend this much money on an electric shaver,  I figured they were all pretty much the same</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is very easy to use, fast to adjust, and easy to clean (just rinse the cutting blades in the sink for 10 seconds, wipe off, and put a drop of oil back on the blades).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li> Like a couple of other reviewers I also believe the motor could be a little more powerful too, but it cuts through my dry beard just fine, so maybe the motor is just right.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it for trimming body hair.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> The price point is high; I&#x27;m no mustache expert</li>
            <li> After doing a lot of research I saw this one to be highly recommended.  </li>
            <li> I highly recomend</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY recommend it.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It can be precisely dialed to your chosen length, doesn&#x27;t need to pass over the face 200 times to get all the hairs (though multiple passes are necessary if you&#x27;re in the very low settings), and it navigates smoothly around my mustache.  </li>
            <li> Thus I had high hopes for this trimmer.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li> But all that said, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> highly recommend it</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend if your in the market for an electric trimmer.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This product has a very nice design but if you have a thick beard, look elsewhere such as the discontinued Panasonic ER224S All-in-One Hair Clipper &amp; Beard Wet/Dry Trimmer.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> If I were still single and needed a quick groom before regular dates with hotties this would be a significant downside of</li>
            <li> If it was a friends trimmer, cool, but one that I expected to be brand new (unused) is pretty nasty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Available in reasonable price compared to other product.</li>
            <li> It does not function smoothly and it is hard to disassemble to clean.  </li>
            <li> It is relatively quiet and cuts fast, and with the adjustable head height it is easy to trim body hair in different areas.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The shaver feels very well made and the wet / dry feature is nice.  </li>
            <li> not user friendly;  beard trimming occurs in a direction opposite to the direction of hairs in beard; does not feet a natural way of trimming.</li>
            <li> very sharp and easy on the face, not irritating.</li>
            <li> I wound up with little more than 5 o&#x27;clock shadow.</li>
            <li> All it needs is a little rinse afterwards and most all of the beard trimmings are gone.</li>
            <li> If you are trimming mostly beard and a little mustache</li>
            <li> but I prefer something a little more substantial.  </li>
            <li> I found the 4050 to have a little more power, which means the 4070 which is also cheaper then this</li>
            <li> I love everything about this razor, but I wish it was a little wider.</li>
            <li> I was trying to pull off the guard to use the bare clippers to do some fine trimming and the 2 white plastic arms that hold it in place broke.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, now the comb slides off easily but still stays put while I&#x27;m trimming, so this hasn&#x27;t been an issue</li>
            <li> For a product that has such a good design and fine adjustment features, this completely fails in three ways.</li>
            <li> easy to use, no clogging and still sharp.  </li>
            <li> The ergonomic design makes it easy to hold for maximum control.&lt;br /&gt;The trim control comb is rounded so as not to gouge or grab the skin like some of the other ones I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m so delighted with this trimmer, because while it doesn&#x27;t come with any accessories, it has a little wheel you can spin that sets the trim length anywhere from 1 to 10 mm long, so it&#x27;s not a fussy process to adjust the hair length.</li>
            <li> It gives a decent shave &amp; trim, and it with 19 individual settings, it&#x27;s just a matter of finding the right one for your needs.</li>
            <li> I would buy again without hesitation, battery life is reasonable and so far product has performed well after some use.</li>
            <li> Works great for the price, however it is bit difficult when cleaning.</li>
            <li> Wow is the trimmer well built and works very well.  </li>
            <li> Yes I&#x27;m cheap &amp; haven&#x27;t spent a lot on trimmers</li>
            <li> She remarked, \\&quot;wow, this thing doesn&#x27;t cut very well does it?\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> You can use this for normal haircuts and also as a beard trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Star rated device.as you normally would.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not a complaint).  </li>
            <li> He doesn&#x27;t usually remark on products but stopped me just to say how much he loved it, especially the built in levels.</li>
            <li> /&gt;only drawback is that it&#x27;s not quite powerful enough...</li>
            <li> This is much better than my Norelco whose plastic groves broke after a few months of use.</li>
            <li> Need a few more words.</li>
            <li> Considering most electric razors and trimmers adapt to various currents around the world this is indeed a strange situation to find myself in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li> My old Phillips 20 dollar model was finally on its last legs, so I decided to upgrade to a better model.  </li>
            <li> It has a normal charge hold/cycle.  </li>
            <li> A dial to select how short you want to trim and an on/off button, and that&#x27;s pretty much it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used it in conjunction with a normal hair comb on my buddy and it worked well.</li>
            <li> The look of it is so modern on the bathroom counter that it is consistent with a 21st century life upgrade.</li>
            <li> I dont know if panasonic is paying this magazine because the trimmer isnt much better than an inexpensive one i bought at k mart a few years ago.  </li>
            <li> Because of my success with this I have now ordered the big brother (Panasonic ER-GS60-S Self-Hair Clipper Wet/Dry).</li>
            <li> One swipe is all it takes to trim correctly, no more raking the trimmer back and forth to get a good trim.</li>
            <li> Tried taping it and supergluing it and got a few more uses</li>
            <li> Quiet powerful wet/dry clippers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased so many over the years and this one falls somewhere in mediocrity.</li>
            <li> Walked around with a bare strip on my beard after using it the first time.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because the trimmer isn&#x27;t as powerful as I would prefer (I would attribute this to the fact that it&#x27;s waterproof - some power is sacrificed for that flexibility).</li>
            <li> Plenty powerful enough for trimming my goatee.</li>
            <li> Has many different lengths, hard to find the right one at first.</li>
            <li> moreover, i don&#x27;t have to shave with as many passes, which cuts down my shaving time considerably.</li>
            <li> just make sure its dry before recharging it obviously.</li>
            <li> I especially appreciate being able to do this task in the shower as it literally washes the trimmings away, no pesky dry cleanup around the bathroom sink.</li>
            <li> The motor is strong enough to where it actually cuts the hair and not just pull it out etc.</li>
            <li> but if you raise the guard high enough you&#x27;re likely fine if you can pull the skin tawt.  </li>
            <li> Zero complaints with this trimmer, keeps my facial hair (goatee) trimmed just right.</li>
            <li> , looks like a solid product, and performs right on target.</li>
            <li> You need to pull it off in order to do close clipping and then get it into the right slots to put it back in.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth the higher price compared to other brands.</li>
            <li> Charging is quick and it holds a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> Not as sharp and powerful as I would like, but the settings allow me to get the exact look I want.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very travel friendly.  </li>
            <li> Also wish that the light changed from red to green (or something) to indicate that it has reached a full charge.</li>
            <li> Fortunately for me, this is the length I typically trim my beard, but does not allow for me to keep my beard neat if I want to go a little more mountain</li>
            <li> and they&#x27;re sending me a new one for $10.00 (includes shipping).  </li>
            <li> so now i am looking for a new trimmer.</li>
            <li> It still works like new and is my go to travel clippers.</li>
            <li> I made a mistake with the Panasonic and am ordering a new Wahl Groomsman.</li>
            <li> about as they live in N.C.,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to be looking for a new trimmer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s under-powered and doesn&#x27;t even live up to the trimmer (brand)</li>
            <li> I had been thinking about getting a new trimmer to replace an ancient one of mine and</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver brand new for $49.</li>
            <li> I will put a new review after having the product a couple of months.</li>
            <li> I found new jobs for it after I started using it.</li>
            <li> I found new jobs for it after I started using it.</li>
            <li> even when it was new when compared to this one.</li>
            <li> - I&#x27;ll live with that.  </li>
            <li> I live in Toronto, Canada.  </li>
            <li> and maybe get a new one.</li>
            <li> new rating for this shaver is:  *</li>
            <li> I checked the price of a new set of blades to have a spare set and found them to be $20.</li>
            <li> I get a new trimmer every couple of years.</li>
            <li> The clippers cut like they were new again.  </li>
            <li> Oiling and cleaning are very easy and hardly takes any time.</li>
            <li> though never really a chore--Panasonic made it even simpler to clean.  </li>
            <li> He used it immediately and loves how accurate and especially how quiet it is.</li>
            <li> I needed a trimmer than can get wet when need be and remain rust-free and clean.</li>
            <li> My beard was pretty long (much longer than 10mm), and it took a couple passes to get rid of all the stragglers.  </li>
            <li> Cuts hair so fast you definitely don&#x27;t want to trim too fast around the neckline with this monster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Holds a charge for a long time, but takes to long to charge up if needed quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Seems to be built well and hope it holds up for many years.</li>
            <li> The light on the stand only indicates that charger is actually on the stand correctly.  </li>
            <li> The light is only red, it will not change colors when it is done charging, nor will it turn</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know of its a power issue or if the head design is just not as effective, but the performance is seriously sub par.</li>
            <li> The narrow clipper now gets into tighter areas around the mouth and sideburns, and really trims the mustache precisely.</li>
            <li> Glad I spent the extra money to buy this.</li>
            <li> Unless you are trying to cultivate some serious beard artistry on your face this trimmer will do the trick nicely.</li>
            <li> spent OVER 45 minutes in the shower doing \\&quot;body grooming\\&quot; (no goose neck or eggs) and even with MANY passes in all different directions</li>
            <li> Just hold it an extra second and it stays on all by itself allowing for free maneuverability.</li>
            <li> The multiple settings are fantastic for beard and facial hair trimming</li>
            <li> The Remington comes with a collection of combs which allows for a much greater range of cutting heights, has better ergonomics and does not require oiling after each use.</li>
            <li> The removable head is now broken because of the cheap plastic tabs that secure it to the shaver head.  </li>
            <li> Its a few years old but does a better job than this one.</li>
            <li> Turned out to be pretty much exactly what I expected after reading the description and reviews.  </li>
            <li> very quiet, although I don&#x27;t oil it as much as it wants, and it holds the charge very good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The unit has a turn dial for how long you want the hair, which is nice, you can also remove it to trim it down to nothing.  </li>
            <li> I am plagued/gifted with very fast growing facial hair, so I wonder why I never went this route before.  </li>
            <li> Remember to oil it very frequently or</li>
            <li> Husband has very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended and the seller was by far cheaper than any retail store.</li>
            <li> I prefer beard trimmers to cut my hair (I cut it short) and this one has a fine blade that cuts closer than my Norelco did, is quiet to use, and the ergonomic design pleasantly surprised me.  </li>
            <li> Love this - works well, I mean really well.</li>
            <li> Thought it was great until a small black plastic piece came off and now it hurts to use.  </li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> Well this is my first adventure into a shaver that actually allows you to keep your  beard.  </li>
            <li> Have purchased many beard trimmers in the past.  </li>
            <li> The angle of the cutter is such that you have to hold it more parallel to your face to get a short cut.</li>
            <li> Finally found a real trimmer!</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> (I normally shave my head completely).</li>
            <li> but I tolerated it... until the battery completely died on me 6 months after buying it!</li>
            <li> These are pretty basic flaws.</li>
            <li> is a pretty solid 4-star shaver for hair/beard/</li>
            <li> I think this is pretty standard for body shaving.  </li>
            <li> It takes many passes on my stubble to get it short enough, and it&#x27;s the same on my beard when using the trimmer guard.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s pretty solid.</li>
            <li> I needed a trimmer that could do a consistent job, and let me figure out the initial length.</li>
            <li> Also a comb attachment which can be dialed up to 10mm.&lt;br /&gt;+My favourite quality about this product is that it is much more quiet than other trimmers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money!</li>
            <li> For some reason it doesn&#x27;t get all the hairs the first, nor second time.</li>
            <li> But for facial hair maintenance, the wet/dry thing is pretty much a meaningless gimmick; you&#x27;ll pluck as many hairs as you trim if trying to touch-up a wet beard, and rinsing longer stubble off the blades wont be as effective as just brushing them off.  </li>
            <li> Sure, other facial trimmers have adjustable combs, but they&#x27;re often flimsy and interfere with the hair making contact with the blades.  </li>
            <li> Its cool to use wet</li>
            <li> I kept it plugged in for the first few days, but then I decided to see how long the battery will last on its own.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Ergonomics is good though I do have to press the small button a couple of times to turn it on, only because that button is too dang small to fit my fingertip into.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I still prefer using a guard, because it looks absolutely ridiculous if you scalp one portion of your beard, and I&#x27;d rather take a little more time over the process and know that it&#x27;s going to look okay</li>
            <li> This is a new version of my husbands old trimmer</li>
            <li> These trimmers are well constructed, works wet or dry and provides very precise grooming.</li>
            <li> Comes with long lasting battery, has comfortable settings, and a close trim.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I had previously used a Wahl professional-style corded hair trimmer to trim my beard, so I freely admit this could be coloring my expectations.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Seems blades could be available for less.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, but this really is a nice hair and beard trimmer.  </li>
            <li> I trimmed my beard far to short the first time...</li>
            <li> Look cool and works great!.&lt;br /&gt;Hoping it will last as lone as the last one?.</li>
            <li> I was a little tentative at first when I took it into the shower with me, but it works even better than I expected.  </li>
            <li> This trimmer, while lacking things such as a nose trimmer and &amp;#34;shaver&amp;#34;, is a much better tool and takes my beard length down to a millimeter or so without the spacer blade.  </li>
            <li> I love the adjustability of it down to 1/2 millimeters by the simple use of a spinning wheel.</li>
            <li> I think it might work ok for trimming longer beards down to short lengths, but if your goal is to maintain a 1-2mm &amp;#34;haven&#x27;t shaved in 4 days&amp;#34; length, look elsewhere.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just be ready to go over the same area a few times, and keep those blades clean!</li>
            <li> On this second attempt I used Dove Body Wash on a section of my body at a time (i.e. chest, left arm, right arm, left leg, right leg etc.)</li>
            <li> This was my second purchase of same product from amazon, i was really amazed by the first one, but this time Blades of the trimmer hurts.</li>
            <li> It works pretty well, takes a few minutes and a few passes and does a nice job.</li>
            <li> its so weak because the rest of the design is nice.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, you still need a second trimmer that gives a very close shave for neatening up the edges of the hairline, it would be absolutely fantastic if it could dial down to \\&quot;zero\\&quot; rather than 1mm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I love the ability to use it wet... or dry.  </li>
            <li> Gotta love the wet or dry cleaning too.</li>
            <li> Often left with a much more ragged shave than my previous shaver.</li>
            <li> As a result, I had to do dry shaving outside of the shower and even that didn&#x27;t go smoothly (so-to-speak).  </li>
            <li> , I like the charging station, but when it comes to functionality, falls short, can&#x27;t really leave nice, uniform, short beard, can&#x27;t use it to set the beard line, also it is not as smooth as other brands when trimming parts with thick hair..</li>
            <li> And his ability to put it back in the original packaging without having the courtesy to at least clean it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I couldn&#x27;t find an adjustable comb replacement, no information about any particular part number or the like (which Panasonic intuitively addresses this by providing replacement part numbers for nearly all the major components of the Milano trimmer in their documentation).  </li>
            <li> This has worked fantastic years later, I have yet to have a single issue.</li>
            <li> Lots of people have posted about the battery issues and while I know there are lots of positive reviews, I strongly rec that everyone take the battery issues seriously.</li>
            <li> The 19 Setting Single Attachment: Anyone who really maintains facial hair understands how crucial fine length-settings are.</li>
            <li> so he uses it pretty much every day or every other day.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, to charge it, it&#x27;s not a simple, plug in this cord and lay it on the counter, it&#x27;s this large plastic contraption that grips the shaver at the sides to charge it.  </li>
            <li> The BLADE isn&#x27;t sharp and thus barely cuts hairs and misses many so you have to hit them 12 times in all different directions</li>
            <li> I do wish it went a little higher than 10 mm, though that is pretty long.&lt;br</li>
            <li> great product for cutting unwanted hair.</li>
            <li> Does a great job at cutting hair on head and on neck.  </li>
            <li> It States Clearly In The Instructions...</li>
            <li> and I assume there use to be a clear plastic sticker or something on the bottom seal</li>
            <li> Otherwise a great trimmer, solid build and has survived quite a few falls and heavy use.</li>
            <li> These do not cut nearly as well as they are touted.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is nowhere near as efficient as those in a barbershop.</li>
            <li> Got this for my boyfriend for his birthday just as his old trimmer died.</li>
            <li> Decided to try this one when the battery died on my old one.</li>
            <li> : It&#x27;s too much to ask that this hand-held, waterproof, compact beard-cutting machine be charged for a day once a week. ... ... ... ...</li>
            <li> : It&#x27;s too much to ask that this hand-held, waterproof, compact beard-cutting machine be charged for a day once a week. ... ... ... ...</li>
            <li> I use it in the shower and rise it directly under water and so far not problems.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift and so far my husband has no complaints.</li>
            <li> Much easier to use than his last brand.</li>
            <li> My old Panasonic gave up and died</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas gift for my adult son.  </li>
            <li> Very well put together totally quality.</li>
            <li> really wanted to like this unit, but life is too short.</li>
            <li> I had an old battery operated Norelco for a decade, this this blows it out of the water.</li>
            <li> , as is the case with my old Wahl model.  </li>
            <li> Now the instructions say it will take 15 to 20 hours to charge up completely.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it 3 times now and each time I have had to completely buzz off my beard since this machine did</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t really notice anything off until I started looking at the dial where you can turn for a different length.</li>
            <li> stars for the fact that I am probably the only people for being graced with a gently used trimmer.</li>
            <li> I have 5 o&#x27;clock shadow and it doens&#x27;t work very well for my short haired beard.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver for my 25 year old son for Christmas.</li>
            <li> I have never received a complete explanation for this yo yo series of transactions.  </li>
            <li> It is completely waterproof so you can do this in the shower, rinse it under your faucet in your sink etc.</li>
            <li> I know some people have a complaint about this machine but as a man who is VERY picky about keeping his beard short and blended, I love it.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t perform as well as my old trimmer.  </li>
            <li> The reciprocating blade doesn&#x27;t align with the fixed cutter head.</li>
            <li> The settings are clearly marked.  </li>
            <li> and the product is not even 30 days old.</li>
            <li> The battery requires 18 hours for complete charge.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my husband&#x27;s old trimmer.</li>
            <li> Works really well and would definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> So far I like this product.</li>
            <li> I gave up, I got out my 10 year old, busted Remington hair trimmer and finished the job in 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> over the years, i have purchased various trimmers from different brands and for the most part it has been different product, same result.</li>
            <li> i prefer my old Norelco Acuvac over this one.</li>
            <li> so far may never try others again?</li>
            <li> no worries so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone over a week without charging even though I use it nearly every day.</li>
            <li> This Panasonic doesn&#x27;t have near the power.</li>
            <li> I like my 8 year old remmington.</li>
            <li> Decided to &amp;#34;splurge&amp;#34; on this instead of fixing the old one.  </li>
            <li> with the grain for smoothing and wild hair removal.</li>
            <li> I like my old one</li>
            <li> I can take the guard off completely for trimming my head hair if I don&#x27;t feel like using a razor on it</li>
            <li> It holds a charge for a long time and cuts consistently.  </li>
            <li> Completely unsatisfactory.</li>
            <li> However I nearly dislocated my thumb trying to slide this off</li>
            <li> This lets me do my head and face to a Number#1 all over in five minutes - even if I have let things get a bit wild.  </li>
            <li> would give it 5 stars if it were not for the frequent lubrication requirement.</li>
            <li> I recommend it for anyone who has to shave their head frequently.</li>
            <li> but they performed similarly although the Wahls did outperform those, not by much though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It taught me that 6 mm is not #4 length on an old fashioned shaver/hair cutter.</li>
            <li> I use it weekly and have had no problems with it so far.</li>
            <li> but the performance of the item so far is</li>
            <li> I went with the lowest setting and that achieved a nearly \\&quot;hairless look\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> hello, i was surprised when it&#x27;sburned out  after one week.</li>
            <li> Many complained about having to oil it after each use.</li>
            <li> ; I thought I had it set at 10mm (when in fact it was set at 1mm) and inadvertently chopped off a big chunk of whiskers I had really planned to keep.  </li>
            <li> it replaces a 14 year old Remington that the battery pack died on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> after using this trimmer for several months now, I&#x27;ve really grown attached to it.  </li>
            <li> far as the trimming is concerned, the Panasonic trimmer works well</li>
            <li> This results in the trimmer yanking out hair and, eventually, completely dying.</li>
            <li> the light would turn green when it was done charging</li>
            <li> Used for 3 weeks so far.</li>
            <li> We tried to use it to cut my 3 year old sons hair and it didn&#x27;t make a dent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned lots of beard trimmers, and they just really aren&#x27;t built to last.</li>
            <li> It offers me the added convenience of being used without the cumbersome electrical cord.  </li>
            <li> Purchased this trimmer because my old trimmer would not hold a charge.</li>
            <li> Comfortable to hold and not too heavy.  </li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my 20 year old son who loves his beard.</li>
            <li> The trouble only increases when that beard is more like a 7 o&#x27;clock shadow.  </li>
            <li> guess it&#x27;s worth the roughly $45</li>
            <li> battery doesn&#x27;t run long enough to trim a full beard on one charge, either.</li>
            <li> One of the more expensive beard trimmers but well worth the investment.</li>
            <li> The trimmer has 19 different settings which means I can have 1 mm worth of beard that gives me that stubble look or I can grow my beard out and then trim it back to 10 mm which gives me the  Ulysses S. Grant look.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t quite have a sense for how long the full charge takes, but I&#x27;ve had no issues getting plenty of juice for my extensive trimming job when I need it.</li>
            <li> I rarely use this to trim wet hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It might work for someone who just has the occasional couple of days worth of stubble to trim, or someone who likes to keep their goatee really short.</li>
            <li> Due to the tiredness and exhaustion of being a relatively new father; coinciding with the &amp;#34;lumbersexual&amp;#34; look in vogue right now; I&#x27;ve grown a beard.</li>
            <li> But that does not deduct from its rating, as most trimmers are not wide enough in less you buy professional barber shears.</li>
            <li> with any trimmer, the downside is keeping the device clean.&lt;br /&gt;Charging the device as been easy with a long battery life lasting 5 days of daily, once a day use for head and beard trimming.</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of starting at the lowest comb setting and plowing right up the middle of my chin.</li>
            <li> I have used several other cheaper beard trimmers and the guard would give an uneven cut, this one is smooth and accurate</li>
            <li> The one downside to it is that any trimmer with a guard trims just a little bit less quickly and accurately than one without.</li>
            <li> Those usually don&#x27;t work well and are easy to lose over time.  </li>
            <li> In particular I really like the &amp;#34;Dial a length&amp;#34; adjustment that no longer needs mounting and installing different combs for different areas of my beard.</li>
            <li> body is small and lightweight and easy to hold.  </li>
            <li> I have gone through a few other trimmers with a kind of &amp;#34;meh&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I fried the charger overseas and the price for a new shaver and charger was about the same as a new charger.</li>
            <li> Need a new charger already, only charged it twice, and now after the 30 day warranty, have to get a new one, for $32...</li>
            <li> /&gt;It comes with a little brush to clean it - but no place to put the brush.</li>
            <li> Powerful and sharp.  </li>
            <li> so it has to be cleaned after every other pass, and even then, it&#x27;s not cutting</li>
            <li> I have another Panasonic razor and it felt the same new last year and now has battery issues and seems ready to fall apart, so</li>
            <li> Hahahaha more expensive than buying brand new.  </li>
            <li> Being able to use it wet or dry is a big plus.</li>
            <li> I have had this product for about 2 years and every so ofter I have to clean it out and lube a few part as directed in the owners manual.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer is not well balanced and this coupled with the lightweight feel led to the feeling that it is more of a toy than a serious trimmer.</li>
            <li> I clean and oil them every few uses</li>
            <li> The depth adjustment is clever, but doesn&#x27;t cut as evenly as the Wahl, which has several guides to attach separately.</li>
            <li> After about an hour of going over the same small spots 20 times or more, I gave up.</li>
            <li> Barely cuts my beard, requires multiple passes, clogs in one pass even though it missed so much.</li>
            <li> Small, Quiet, Light, ergonomic and packs a punch!</li>
            <li> Would be better with a wider cutting area, but overall a strong shaver.</li>
            <li> My trimming time has been cut in half, as this trimmer is actually able to cut the hairs in a single pass (Imagine That!).  </li>
            <li> This was a major upgrade over my old trimmer.</li>
            <li> The cheap ones will cut and snag painfully, but this is smooth, quiet, powerful, and does not snag and cut.  </li>
            <li> On the plus side, this trimmer appears to be very solidly built and of high quality.  </li>
            <li> had really high hopes for this thing, but it just couldn&#x27;t compete with the last trimmer I had.</li>
            <li> the charge last a long time, simple to clean...</li>
            <li> main problem, though, is that the battery didn&#x27;t even last a year before it got to the point where the trimmer would go from a full charge to completely dead in about 45 seconds.</li>
            <li> Feels solid and makes little noise&lt;br /&gt;Built in dial to adjust trimming length is much better than multiple replaceable guards</li>
            <li> No down side.</li>
            <li> Wet Dry feature is fantastic and I have purchased 3 of them for gifts for my friends.</li>
            <li> If there are durability issues, I will re-post, but for now, there are no down sides to this trimmer.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks, using it once or twice a week, the initial charge is still going strong.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend it to others, I do not have a super thick beard but it handles the hair I have very well, both trim and edging</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d expect that red light to either shut off or turn green when the charge is complete, but it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> It holds a charge for a long time, and the stand is really convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through about four in the past two years that were cheap and among them were Remington in the norelco entry level trimmers</li>
            <li> But, with the exception of a few trimmers, which I felt were of lesser quality, most of them were of similar design.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t use it in the shower with the guard on to do your normal trimming of your entire beard.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got a thick, coarse beard, and I enjoy how this trimmer really lets me customize how close I want my hair.</li>
            <li> Using the trimmer in wet conditions is exactly as desirable as mowing your lawn in the rain.</li>
            <li> Very quiet, the charging cradle doesn&#x27;t take up too much room in my small bathroom, and the submersible and washable design is just way too cool.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected</li>
            <li> Perhaps they&#x27;re useful for someone with an extremely dense beards, but it barely worked for me.</li>
            <li> It died in the middle of me trimming my beard before work after vacation- hilarious but it really is just a piss poor shaver.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice that it can handle being wet and the base is nice for automatic recharging.  </li>
            <li> Nothing to swap out between lengths, and a quick change if I want it a little shorter.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an amount which will likely only by noticed by your female friend but given how much time I spent I expected better</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since this is made to work wet or dry though, I&#x27;m not really surprised that it can&#x27;t be plugged in since I doubt they want someone doing something foolish like stepping into the shower holding something plugged into an outlet :)</li>
            <li> The fact that this is both wet and dry is unique.</li>
            <li> But it may have just been hard to tell because the charge indicator light quit working completely after a couple of months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And instead of experimenting with different adjustable combs that might fit--I just decided to get a new beard trimmer, but not before doing a bit of research.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Their default advice is to buy a new one which with shipping is more expensive than buying a new machine from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I lost it and it cost me the same as a new trimmer to replace it.</li>
            <li> is more powerful and has a dial setting that comes off for close cutting.</li>
            <li> Surprised at how quiet it is compared to my old Norelco trimmer.</li>
            <li> Even on a beard that&#x27;s less than fun.</li>
            <li> The only downside about this product is the long charge time (first time charge is 36 hours).</li>
            <li> The length adjustment is simple and straight forward despite not having a truly short setting.</li>
            <li> Really like the adjustment configuration, wont slip to different length in the middle of trimming your beard.  </li>
            <li> The motor isn&#x27;t nearly as powerful as on the Wahl 9854-600 trimmer that I previously used until its battery died.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Definitely would recommend this product to anyone that consistently keeps their beard groomed - long or short.</li>
            <li> I am learning to use this daily as my only shaveng tool and its working, this is the real deal</li>
            <li> I know that things aren&#x27;t built to last any more, but you figure it&#x27;ll work for at least two years,</li>
            <li> I saw so much blood in the last several months</li>
            <li> would like it if the charging light could switch from red to green when it&#x27;s fully charged, but mine just doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Which means if the battery goes dead and you want to use it really quickly, you have to wait for it to charge up a bit before you can use</li>
            <li> I keep a consistent beard and my hair gets pretty thick.  </li>
            <li> I imagine someone with very coarse thick hair may have more issues than I&#x27;ve had given the not-so-powerful motor on this unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Being able to use it in the shower means no sink full of hair and the charging base is smartly designed.  </li>
            <li> Spend just a little more and get something that will last a long time and work well during that time.</li>
            <li> Even after charging for a whole day, the charge does not hold even for a single shave.</li>
            <li> This trimmer cuts like no other trimmer I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> Sharp blades cut hair the first time, no need to keep going over an area again.</li>
            <li> It has been a major headache.  </li>
            <li> like all other clippers of this variety that I am aware of, it requires you to oil it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
            <li> Major downside is having to charge this for 24h to get 1h of usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use them to trim facial hair and even to get a close shave on my head and by simply applying a little bit of the oil that came with them, they continue to go strong.</li>
            <li> Overall good trimmer, but very poor description.</li>
            <li> This item is selling for $69 right now on Amazon, but you can get it for $20 less both online and in stores.</li>
            <li> My old Panasonic trimmer finally died on me, which by the way served me well for years and years, so I decided to go with their new facial</li>
            <li> Not really feeling this clipper,it works better when my goatee is wet then dry.</li>
            <li> Love the adjustable dial,  Works in the shower, wish the cutting teeth were wider takes more passes to shave my head with this trimmer than with my previous trimmer.</li>
            <li> Once the hair gets wet (and we&#x27;re only talking about a half inch of hair at the most)</li>
            <li> It must be the large and wide comb head that lets it get closer in the contours of your face.</li>
            <li> was at first concerned that the rolling length selector would change while holding the trimmer in an awkward or offhand position, but I can say that the selection has a very secure click to lock into each length.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The wet feature and easy clean makes it pretty versitile, but alas where this trimmer falls short (along with every trimmer minus Philips Norelco) is the vacuum feature.</li>
            <li> While they may work, it just takes too long compared to a high powered corded model.</li>
            <li> Sure, one can do that in the shower and have virtually no clean up...as long as one is prepared to take an hour long shower to trim any beard that is longer than the shortest settings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice, because I&#x27;m always getting to try the \\&quot;latest and greatest\\&quot;, bad because I have to invest another $50 every few years.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is one of the poorer shavers I have used, does not cut evenly, takes  a really long time to trim my beard, doesn&#x27;t really work that well on coarse</li>
            <li> Beard trimmings sticking to the rubber handle and can&#x27;t be brushed off (an old pet-peeve of mine).</li>
            <li> I had and old panasonic trimmer that finally died.</li>
            <li> has the power to trim even the wildest beards yet has NEVER even grabbed a hair and yanked it out, especially when you&#x27;re trimming up &#x27;sensitive&#x27; areas - you know, like your neck and Adam&#x27;s apple areas.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m back to my 18 year old beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Not really what I expected.  </li>
            <li> Only had it for about a months, but so far no issues.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend&#x27;s old trimmer finally died, and he insisted that he was just going to start shaving.</li>
            <li> Pulled hairs and actually nicked sensitive areas when using the shaver with no attachments.</li>
            <li> Only drawback is prior to first use you need to charge it for a LONG time.  </li>
            <li> My old Philips Norelco beard trimmer finally died after years of use</li>
            <li> the once mighty Braun now makes stuff that feels like this, so I guess real solid build quality just doesn&#x27;t provide the repeat business of products designed to last a few years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A #6 setting on my old Norelco is not the same as a #6 on the Panasonic.</li>
            <li> I have noticed however that the charger light indicator stays red and does not turn to Green at any point which I can only assume</li>
            <li> Overall I would still recommend this to anyone  as far as Beard/hair trimmers go.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It gets two stars because it does work, but barely.</li>
            <li> While both have a built-in length adjustment, this Panasonic trimmer seems to be much safer, allowing a much faster shave at the same length setting along uneven terrain.</li>
            <li> I can barely trim my face before it peters out each morning.</li>
            <li> I use the waterproof feature frequently and rinse it daily.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went back to my old Conair iStubble.</li>
            <li> so I can keep up with my buzz cut on a semi-daily basis but for larger jobs I&#x27;ll look into getting a professional Oster.</li>
            <li> I like to keep my stubble short, 1MM, and after a week of screwing around with this trimmer, I dug my old one -- a Philips -- out of the cupboard.</li>
            <li> It was actually delivered early.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never left a review on a product I&#x27;ve bought before because they have always directly reflected their review</li>
            <li> I prefer the prior Panasonic wet/dry beard trimmer to this one by far.  </li>
            <li> matter how careful or how much shaving cream I use or don&#x27;t use</li>
            <li> a trimmer it works OK, not great.</li>
            <li> This is sad because the item looks nice and was performing well otherwise.</li>
            <li> Of all the units I&#x27;ve tested and personally used, the Panasonic Milano wins hands down.</li>
            <li> Seriously, not one single illustration of how to take it apart.</li>
            <li> In order to trim down longer hair consistently you have to start at a much higher height and work your way down</li>
            <li> Caution...start out on the higher settings and work down to find the length you want.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is not as effective in cutting hair (on top of your head, I mean) as a dedicated barber&#x27;s clipper.</li>
            <li> Unlike a lot of other trimmers which can plug straight into the device, this one has a charging stand, and no other way to charge the device.  </li>
            <li> Read the reviews that complained about the dial being visible from front and back and, while that is true, it doesn&#x27;t take a genius to figure out which side you should read!  </li>
            <li> The attached comb can be precisely and quickly adjusted or removed for adjusting cutting height.</li>
            <li> agree with other reviewers that comment on the lack of a charge meter to let you know how much battery is left or when it is completely charged.&lt;br</li>
            <li> No mess left for me!</li>
            <li> I started out too long and quickly dial it down until I hit the length that I wanted.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Use it as a dry razor and oil it as you normally would.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Norelco in the past, and they were pretty decent, but I had to make several passes over my beard to get all the hair even.  </li>
            <li> I was tired of having all my hair trimmings cover the bathroom sink and my wife going crazy with the mess.&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer is powerful enough to use on my head as a close crop device and works brilliantly in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li> only other issues were that it takes a long time to charge up and the charge seems to die off quickly, but that could have been because of it struggling to cut through the coarser</li>
            <li> He usually groans at the thought of having to clean up his beard (he keeps it short) but not with this tool.</li>
            <li> The locking height setting cures a pet peeve with other trimmers that can change if to much pressure is applied.</li>
            <li> Other than that it works very well.</li>
            <li> I find that it&#x27;s hard to get an even, clean shave</li>
            <li> Hard to clean.</li>
            <li> hard to clean.</li>
            <li> The charge has lasted a long time so far!</li>
            <li> A little slow but cuts nice.</li>
            <li> This is a huge negative, since this trimmer can only be used as a cordless.  </li>
            <li> duh, I have to clean out and oil all my electric razors.</li>
            <li> You can really see the difference between a 9 mm long and a 10 mm long</li>
            <li> I will likely be purchasing another shaver for my beard in the near future.  </li>
            <li> He just went back to college and took this with him, and left his old electric razor here.  </li>
            <li> I have a feeling this one is going to last a while, so I&#x27;m glad I am not spending that while with a poorly designed, dysfunctional piece of shi...  Er, equipment.</li>
            <li> I wish the settings went a little higher so I could rock a thicker beard.</li>
            <li> Sometimes pulls hair - blades not sharp enough?  </li>
            <li> It took me a little bit to figure out exactly how to do that, because the instructions were unclear.  </li>
            <li> It sounds really underpowered, and the battery doesn&#x27;t last as long as I would prefer, but overall really solid feel, build, and</li>
            <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve purchased this trimmer only because I dropped my previous one right on the head and bent the blades.</li>
            <li> the whole hour, here was my routine: I&#x27;d trim over about a 2 inch strip of beard, turn the thing off, take it apart, clear out every little hair, put it back together, turn it on, and repeat.</li>
            <li> The other ones that we have had have different shields that are easily lost and misplaced.  </li>
            <li> The base is a perfect cradle for this shaver; it doesn&#x27;t needlessly cling to the shaver, so it can easily be removed and placed back with one hand.  </li>
            <li> I use the Panasonic not only as a beard trimmer but also a general purpose body trimmer.</li>
            <li> The Braun, on the other hand, works extremely well, providing very consistent, even trimming on all parts of my beard.</li>
            <li> Seems there had been some conversation about the need to neaten up that beard and now there is no excuse.</li>
            <li> in fact the increments are so tiny that you can barely notice the difference between them)&lt;br</li>
            <li> No slipping of shaving guide head where you have different depths of trimming; here you just set and go!</li>
            <li> I like how quiet this trimmer is, it is barely noticeable.........</li>
            <li> The adjustable comb would be quite difficult to break without some considerable mishandling or a lofty drop (unless stored with the comb in its most extended length--not recommended obviously).  </li>
            <li> The adjustable comb would be quite difficult to break without some considerable mishandling or a lofty drop (unless stored with the comb in its most extended length--not recommended obviously).  </li>
            <li> First it trims my beard unevenly.</li>
            <li> Worth the purchase over others I&#x27;ve had in the past.</li>
            <li> I also use it on my head, and I&#x27;ve got a thick full head of hair.  </li>
            <li> Full beard, or thick beard (5-6ish mm)?</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it if you have a thick, full beard.  </li>
            <li> The guard pushes down the hair too much</li>
            <li> A little quieter than expected and almost sounds like it&#x27;s not going full bore,</li>
            <li> Other than that the unit has a decent quality feel to it</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is very unfortunate because I loved it enough to bare the cleaning and oiling and actually considered to give it 4 stars instead of 5.  </li>
            <li> guess other people just supplement with there regular shaver or straight razor...or simply don&#x27;t shave there neck or trim around your mustache or below your bottom lip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Before the Panasonic, I had a Wahl 9918-6171 Groomsman Beard and Mustache Trimmer for several years that I liked, but thought that I would get something with a little more power when the battery finally failed and I was forced to replace it.  </li>
            <li> is too large for tight spaces</li>
            <li> No more digging for the right attachment.  </li>
            <li> quite as high as other models.  </li>
            <li> I have had bad luck with attachments in the past, but this machine is awesome.</li>
            <li> The Guard is much shorter than my previous Remington trimmer.</li>
            <li> I guess 50 minutes run time goes a long way when it takes only a minute or so to trim up the old beard.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Had double trouble with Item ,needed to return twice, first trimmer would not snap-in ,than charger would not charge, would not recommend this shaver</li>
            <li> Also, it has a red light on the ugly dock which never turns to any other colors after many hour in charge.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Starting at the top of one sideburn down to my jaw line I slowly trim in the direction of hair growth after the row</li>
            <li> The new trimmer takes a long time to charge, but holds the charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> Have not used it wet, but dry trimming works very well.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;While it is water resistant the low-quality blade doesn&#x27;t really trim longer wet beard hairs, and even on a dry beard the longest setting (1cm) is quite short.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Cuts a little shorter than he wants</li>
            <li> It is also surprisingly small and light - much smaller and lighter than any other clippers I have used.  </li>
            <li> All those little hairs that insist on going straight outward get chopped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My husband needed a new trimmer for his beard, and since I had no first hand experience...</li>
            <li> Honestly, I would be willing to pay $200+ for a serious durable beard trimmer that is &#x27;truly&#x27; one-pass, but until then Ill stick with this one.</li>
            <li> Second, the advertisement of being able to use it in the shower is a little misleading, or at least it was to me.  </li>
            <li> For what you get, the price is very attractive.my clipper frequently, so I expect the oilable part of the clipper to get dull or fall apart eventually.</li>
            <li> only feature it doesn&#x27;t have is the built-in vacuum</li>
            <li> I did notice the blades don&#x27;t have quite the same, rock steady cutting power of a plugged in shaver, but that&#x27;s to be expected with most rechargeable battery shavers.  </li>
            <li> I would agree with some that the motor seems underpowered and it gets a bit bogged down when you move too quickly through hair.  </li>
            <li> I wish I would have stuck with vacuum Phillip Norelco that I had before.</li>
            <li> &quot; with the Oster barber clippers hairs have a way of \\&quot;flying away from you\\&quot; and making a hand vacuum mandatory.  </li>
            <li> Would give 5 stars if it had a vacuum, hair goes</li>
            <li> that)&lt;br /&gt;No vacuum</li>
            <li> (see the [[ASIN:B003U8ESI4 Philips Norelco Vacuum Trimmer Pro]].</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer to replace my Norelco Vacuum Turbo Trimmer.</li>
            <li> I can still use it with one of the sides broken off, but no idea many cleanings before the other side breaks as well and since it&#x27;s in the handle and not the guard piece itself this item will be junk.</li>
            <li> It is a little bit of a pain to oil it regularly, but normal upkeep should be standard</li>
            <li> The adjustable head was new to me but easy to use and no issues while cutting, take off the adjustable head</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say how many times I&amp;#34;ve cut myself with regular clippers because the protective combs were too long or useless.  </li>
            <li> The plastic guard does not easily pop off, you just have to finagle with it and pull on the outer tabs or push them in until you wrestle the guard off to clean it (with the tiny cleaning brush you&#x27;ll have trouble finding again) and to oil it.  </li>
            <li> The battery last long enough for me to trim my entire head and beard with no issues.  </li>
            <li> but I know I spent approximately 35-40 minutes in there to complete a FULL BODY SHAVE.  </li>
            <li> The ONLY down side is that I have to take the guard off to clear the clogged facial hair.</li>
            <li> I am going to buy a new Norelco and make trimming my beard easier and less work.</li>
            <li> A real shame, because the clipper is small enough to travel with you.</li>
            <li> &quot; but this left me doing a brief touch-up dry shave with this razor outside of the shower.  </li>
            <li> Leaves lots of stragglers behind, and I have to clean up with another trimmer.</li>
            <li> no last me long, only 50 minutes.</li>
            <li> no last me long, only 50 minutes.</li>
            <li> If used for only brief periods charge lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> When I first opened it, I saw this small grey plastic thing on the bathroom floor.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Depending on how long the lifespan is on this and future results I may consider a Norelco Body Groomer on my next go-around.  </li>
            <li> I went to Amazon and found this exact same item for sale for less than half the price and guaranteed to be shipped to arrive before Christmas with no charge for shipping.</li>
            <li> This wouldn&#x27;t be a major problem with other shavers, but since it&#x27;s a sealed device you can&#x27;t just plug it in and keep going if the battery gets low</li>
            <li> Charger is compact and a little confusing because the trimmer can fit in both ways but only charges one way.  </li>
            <li> I normally like the long stubble look and the lowest setting (#1) on this trimmer was actually a little too short for me</li>
            <li> I had been using much cheaper styles in the past.</li>
            <li> Usually they are well thought out, and have always been very reliable and durable.</li>
            <li> I really like this one because it goes in MM&#x27;s as apposed to your usual 1,2,3,4..ect settings.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for the sharpest clipper for a long time and finally found it Panasonic ER-GB40-S</li>
            <li> and it appears that this dial mechanism will continue to work properly for a long time.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had facial hair in a long time.</li>
            <li> long lasting charge too</li>
            <li> and you should have a razor that last for a long time.</li>
            <li> Long lasting battery life.</li>
            <li> My only caution is in regard to long term battery reliability...</li>
            <li> Long lasting battery.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that as long as you cut with the blades parallel to your skin (as opposed to perpendicular), my hair is almost never pulled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This trimmer allows me to keep it as long or short as I want it.</li>
            <li> My only reservation is how it holds up over the long haul.  </li>
            <li> A minor critique only.</li>
            <li> The multiple settings are useful, but the battery was surprisingly weak.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It gets worse though, and this is the real dealbreaker that is making me throw this out and get another Wahl: it grabs and pulls hair near the neckline when trimming it up!</li>
            <li> Weak enough that when I was trimming around my beard, it was pulling hairs out, not cutting them.</li>
            <li> Instead, I give it 2  if you have the money for a good but disposable trimmer:-[ .  </li>
            <li> Not bad but not great.</li>
            <li> This thing gets through all kinds of hair (and I mean all kinds of hair) very, very well.  </li>
            <li> I decided to revert to my old Panasonic personal groomer which actually only needed minor repair to its guard (nothing like a little superglue).</li>
            <li> but I marked it down</li>
            <li> Old one trimmed by stroking down</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it a few weeks and used it a handful of times,  but it seems to work very well and is extremely well made.</li>
            <li> /&gt;But, that&#x27;s not really a big deal, and probably no different from other, similar products.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately if you want a wet/dry beard trimmer, there is NO GOOD OPTION that can be bought right now.</li>
            <li> Shaves well, just didn&#x27;t last very long on my experience.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the guide is to big a part of a beard trimmer to be cheap and flimsy.</li>
            <li> I gave it one extra star because at least it really is water proof.</li>
            <li> I only wish it had more cutting options in between 1mm and 4mm.</li>
            <li> Cutting could be better as needs multiple passes, but I had no pulling as described by some others.  </li>
            <li> However, you could probably get away with less frequent oiling without causing any problems.  </li>
            <li> Lighter than my Wahl head trimmer, and the wet shave capability really sold me on this as an everyday device.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to know how long the batter lasts.</li>
            <li> He does say that you need to mess around with the settings first to really get a feel of the length of cut and to not press down too hard.</li>
            <li> I guess they figure you never travel, or if you do, it will last weeks on a single charge.  </li>
            <li> Had to make about 3-4 passes over a single area, at different angles, to get everything even in that one spot.</li>
            <li> only complaint would be the blade gaps are a little more narrow than my Remington</li>
            <li> I have never tried to use this trimmer while wet because it barely cuts dry hair.</li>
            <li> I only shave one a week and use this on the shortest setting to trim my face and head down short enough to shave with a blade.</li>
            <li> my bathroom to begin with and none of my other shavers require such a large contraption - they just have a small plug.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also it seems to last a long time on a single charge...</li>
            <li> the only thing I would alter if I could would be a wider blade -- other than that -- I&#x27;ll definitely buy another when needed</li>
            <li> Even still some hairs were missed due to having to \\&quot;back track\\&quot; and try and hit hairs from multiple angles.  </li>
            <li> However, since the numbers are on a continuous wheel from low to high, it was hard to know which side to read.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been disappointed by any Panasonic product from my fist little mono cassette deck to this great trimmer.</li>
            <li> Cuts well and the guard makes it safe for cutting below the waist.</li>
            <li> but the sound makes me feel uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Really love the dial for adjusting the cutting depth.</li>
            <li> Also, you might find the battery dying at the most inconvenient time.</li>
            <li> He likes it longer and was afraid this might not be able to keep it the length he wanted it.</li>
            <li> Shaves close, holds a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> takes tooo long to charge</li>
            <li> I expect it to have long life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If it lasts as long as I hope it does, then the price should be a non-issue.</li>
            <li> not for long hair.&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll see how long the battery stands up to charge/discharge cycles.  </li>
            <li> The battery stays charged for a long time and the adjustability of the trimmer can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> The only thing I dislike about it, which is not really much, is its proprietary charger.</li>
            <li> The downside is that takes long time to charge</li>
            <li> My only concern (which got it 4 instead of five stars) is it wasn&#x27;t as robust  as I expected</li>
            <li> It holds a charge for quite a long time too.</li>
            <li> Long battery life, lots of adjustments, does well on both beard and moustache</li>
            <li> Keeps a charge for a long time (took it on vacation for a week without the charger and had no problems).&lt;br /&gt;Keep</li>
            <li> Holds its charge for a long time - didn&#x27;t charge it for a month, went to use it again</li>
            <li> It holds a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> When you go to the barber they take a couple of passes on your head but not nearly like what this trimmer needs.  </li>
            <li> Should have bought it a long time ago.</li>
            <li> Holds charge for a long time.  </li>
            <li> One thing you have to be careful is to use the trimmer from one direction only which means the part of blade not facing the start button.</li>
            <li> If your beard gets long, you have to take it steps because it can&#x27;t trim a bunch at once.</li>
            <li> Not professional grade by any means.  </li>
            <li> COMPLETE waste of time.</li>
            <li> Stay&#x27;s charged for a long time.</li>
            <li> As well, there is often hair-pulling when detailing without the blade guard.&lt;br /&gt;Everyone mentions it, but long charge time (20 hrs).&lt;br /&gt;Poor</li>
            <li> The day long charge time is a bit out there.</li>
            <li> holds a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> Long charging life...</li>
            <li> It takes 3-4x as long to trim my beard than the Conair does.</li>
            <li> gripes are minor and livable.  </li>
            <li> Especially the precision dial and the fact that it can get wet in the shower.</li>
            <li> I need to charge it in-between a shave, and it takes a long time to recharge.</li>
            <li> The long charging time (30 hours I believe) is a minor inconvenience.  </li>
            <li> As long as you leave it on the charger it appears to be charging.  </li>
            <li> The battery holds a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> It holds a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> Long charge times&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I would recommend the Panasonic Milano Men&#x27;s All-in-one Hair and Beard Trimmer only to people who want to take advantage of the ability to use the trimmer in a wet environment.  </li>
            <li> Adjustable depth allows you to  start on the long side and reduce the length of the cut with a click or two.  </li>
            <li> Expect it to take as long as a crappy trimmer</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t pull, it stays charged a long time.</li>
            <li> It arrived when expected and was packaged properly.  </li>
            <li> Long battery life.</li>
            <li> Cuts crisp, though with my head does require a few passes (not precisely made for that,</li>
            <li> Works great&lt;br /&gt;Still not certain where to oil w daily use!</li>
            <li> The last one last less than 6 months.  </li>
            <li> Some things to be wary of: the measurements (mm) don&#x27;t correspond very well to other devices, so go for MUCH longer and work your way in.</li>
            <li> I have owned a Panasonic wet/dry shaver in the past and it was time for a new one.</li>
            <li> not very powerful, so I have to go over the same spots over and over again.  </li>
            <li> This was no exaggeration and the Wahls usually required a few passes and inevitably some hair would be pulled because of the large spaces between the stifled blade teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Runs a long time on a single charge.  </li>
            <li> This makes it effectively worthless unless I own a second piece of shaving equipment as I generally need to trim some parts of my beard close and others just cut down to size.</li>
            <li> Furthermore, it&#x27;s much smaller than any other trimmer I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> Also, unlike other trimmers I&#x27;ve owned, this one only cuts as I move it upwards, against the grain.</li>
            <li> It keeps a charge for a really long time!</li>
            <li> Other than that a solid product.</li>
            <li> It does it after sometimes only 30 seconds and other times after a minute or so.</li>
            <li> After reading online reviews, I chose this as a replacement as it was described &amp;#34;no-frills, no-nonsense, one-pass trimmer.&amp;#34; Compared to the other mass-produced commercial brands, I suppose agree.</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer because i read a review in a mens magazine that picked it above all other beard trimmers.  </li>
            <li> long battery life too!</li>
            <li> I will be looking for a replacement as I don&#x27;t like the scalped look on my chin when the other areas are a different length.</li>
            <li> Make sure you double check the settings, I used to have a beard, made my son cry, my dog bark, my wife says it will grow back:-(</li>
            <li> Hard to find adjustable trimmers at a decent price</li>
            <li> How hard is it to find a decent trimmer?</li>
            <li> It needs very long time to charge fully</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had it very long.  </li>
            <li> Very long battery life as well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Based on the hundreds of glowing reviews, it&#x27;s entirely possible that I just got a lemon, but even when it was new and actually worked long enough to trim my whole face, it did such a bad job that I usually had to go back and shave anyway to avoid looking like I had mange.</li>
            <li> Very hardcore users will take their blade maintenance seriously, I don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve used it dry.</li>
            <li> When you \\&quot;dry</li>
            <li> even with using it dry.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re gonna go with a dry buzz</li>
            <li> Trimmer works quite well dry.</li>
            <li> and I expect them to last for the next few years.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- extremely silent (I&#x27;ve had 2 Norelcos before only to learn that these trimmers can be silent after purchased the Panasonic)&lt;br /&gt;- stylish (actually the charging base slightly resembles a vagina to me...</li>
            <li> downsides are all related to the charging: there no useful battery indicator, the charge cycle is extraordinarily long, and it comes with an oddly-shaped, space-consuming charger.</li>
            <li> My daughter used it to give me a buzz cut and it left uneven patches and stragglers; same goes for using it on my beard.</li>
            <li> Gotta go over same area a few times to get all hair the same length</li>
            <li> Because the charge unit supplied is not suitable for our Australian electric current (220-240 Volts) and only has a input of 110-120 Volts.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for the this trimmer based on the review, but quickly realized it was a bad purchase.</li>
            <li> I have moderately course facial hair and every other trimmer I&#x27;ve used bogs down when trimming the smallest stubble.  </li>
            <li> Seriously, I have bought many of these, and am very hard to please.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this trimmer for about 2 months and haven&#x27;t had a single occasion where I felt this product didn&#x27;t meet or exceed my expectations.  </li>
            <li> Battery lasts for 2-3 months on a single charge.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- has to be oiled before and after use, every single time</li>
            <li> Well, to make a long story short, even though I have had this trimmer for less than two weeks and have never used it. . .</li>
            <li> Battery lasts for quite some time (I get a few weeks out of it at least), but recharge time is pretty long (overnight).  </li>
            <li> however when trimming wet long hair, some hair is missed.  </li>
            <li> These two minor details are nothing compared to when it arbitrarily decides to stab a hole in your face...</li>
            <li> problem is that it does not do well with thick, coarse (african american beard)hair at all.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic looks better on paper, and dosen&#x27;t have a very silly name</li>
            <li> It takes the place of having a bunch of loose guides.</li>
            <li> it takes the hair down to the total bald look.</li>
            <li> Being macho, I didn&#x27;t read the instructions and set the blade at 6 mm and cut my beard down too short.  </li>
            <li> Since I can dial it up or down in a second</li>
            <li> However, this hasn&#x27;t been a big issue since the battery lasts a very long time off a charge and it usually just gets left plugged in all the time.</li>
            <li> I had to quit in the middle, get out of the shower, dry my head thoroughly, and have my fiancée help fix the mess that I&#x27;d made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even though the motor sounds a little underpowered it never bogged down.</li>
            <li> Easy and adjustable; no need for separate cutting clips</li>
            <li> The adjustable dial makes setting the cutting length easy.  </li>
            <li> Previously owned several trimmers from Phillips/Norelco.</li>
            <li> The beard trimmer&#x27;s dial settings are difficult to understand at first, with the setting numbers viewable from both front and back.</li>
            <li> I have tried several different beard trimmers before the Panasonic and regardless of all height adjustment on this unit, I was not satisfied of the closeness of the cut.</li>
            <li> I owned previous Panasonic trimmer for five years, finally it broke in air travel...</li>
            <li> Shaving a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow takes multiple passes over the same small area.  </li>
            <li> Handles wet or dry without a hitch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Can be used wet or dry.</li>
            <li> Wet or Dry</li>
            <li> oh, and you can use this wet or dry.</li>
            <li> Of course, as the description suggests, it can be used wet or dry.  </li>
            <li> only way you should consider buying this is if you want to trim a beard slightly longer than stubble.</li>
            <li> used with the guard on, this is a very safe trimmer and it would be hard to hurt yourself on even when used in delicate spots like behind your ears.</li>
            <li> The only down fall to this item is it is a little big when using on your face.</li>
            <li> /&gt;\\&quot;Honey, why are there these long curly hairs in my beard trimmer?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;(muffled laughter from the other room)&lt;br</li>
            <li> My only note would be that it is difficult to get small precise cuts/trims even with blade guard removed.</li>
            <li> Skeptical at first as all my prior trimmers died after getting wet.</li>
            <li> The frustration really sets in when an already weak motor becomes even weaker with a run-down battery</li>
            <li> He tried it on his head and it died after shaving only 1/3 of his head leaving his hair a mess.</li>
            <li> Would not recommend and will be going to a different brand for my future purchases, the first of which will be replacing this disappointing trimmer.</li>
            <li> I bought this item because my kids always loose the little attachments that come with a regular hair trimmer and</li>
            <li> Still running on a single charge!  </li>
            <li> This product is really great for tasks such as: Trimming hair; cutting small amounts of thin hair; trimming whiskers; making bodyparts with hair, hairless; shortening hair.</li>
            <li> But if I ever decide to mow down to a goatee, or let my beard get a bit too long between touch-ups, then I&#x27;d probably reach for the full cutting power of my plug-in Wahl, since it can mow through anything with relative ease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The results are an uneven patchy mess that you will have to completely shave to even out.</li>
            <li> I really do believe that it is either a WET SHAVE ELECTRIC issue OR a WEAK ASS MOTOR issue.  </li>
            <li> Took a little time to figure out theright length settings for my beard, it shaves a little closer than my old one.</li>
            <li> I use it to trim what little hair I have left</li>
            <li> , one other very minor thing  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t plan to oil up my clipper frequently, so I expect the oilable part of the clipper to get dull or fall apart eventually.</li>
            <li> And it is really bad at fitting under the nose to get the mustache trimmed.</li>
            <li> They are cheaply made, the blades instead of cutting are ripping the hair.</li>
            <li> Precise adjustable cutting settings</li>
            <li> smooth cutting.</li>
            <li> It trims precisely, holds a charge and does not pull hairs when cutting.</li>
            <li> While he really likes the power of a plug-in unit, I find that the cord is difficult to manage and makes accurate trimming difficult.</li>
            <li> The only negative is I wish you could adjust it for something bigger than 10 mm.</li>
            <li> I think if the head was turned 180 degrees (facing the power button), it would feel better (silly complaint, I know).</li>
            <li> Yet, any man who has a thick or heavy beard might be very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not that there is anything wrong with that, but I can&#x27;t be the only person that wants to look like I have a beard intentionally, not out of laziness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I could possibly learn to use it better, but I&#x27;ve been using the trimmer for a few months and have yet to trim without pulling neck hairs painfully.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a lot quieter than I had expected.</li>
            <li> I will update after a few months, and that is the only reason for the 4 star rating,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easily jammed by hair.&lt;br /&gt;5.</li>
            <li> Use lather or shaving oil or on a Wet Face when not using the guard.</li>
            <li> Also, Oil the machine up every time you use it wet</li>
            <li> 50 MINUTES, roughly, of use-time before needing a recharge.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> Have not tried it wet yet.</li>
            <li> no real complaints  </li>
            <li> but if it lasts a few months I may come back and up it to a 5.</li>
            <li> It is not really a pleasure experience unlike Norelco where the length of the blade is tad longer than this one.</li>
            <li> so its longivity is unknown at this time.  </li>
            <li> the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;The cut is consistently uneven, with my chin being cut very short</li>
            <li> No real issues with it.</li>
            <li> I like its charging solution, as it prevents a wet device from shorting out.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It cuts quite well (it does pull sometimes, but not very often..</li>
            <li> He uses it everyday and loves the simple features.  </li>
            <li> It literally has broken teeth, and it did so much</li>
            <li> As a Sasquatch, the trimmer did not cut through the rough.....</li>
            <li> poor beard died so fast</li>
            <li> Can be used for wet shaving too</li>
            <li> This thing is a jewel in the rough.</li>
            <li> It required multiple passes and pulled a few hairs off my chin (no matter what direction i ran it).</li>
            <li> No more slips and bare patches in my beard.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 43 with a regular beard...not a heavy beard.</li>
            <li> and I have absolutely no complaints.</li>
            <li> My initial thoughts after a few uses.  </li>
            <li> I, unfortunately was not blessed with a golden ratio face.  </li>
            <li> The only problem is that I have to go over my beard a few times, it leaves hair.</li>
            <li> a minus.  </li>
            <li> a feature missing in my last couple of shavers.</li>
            <li> Over the last 6 months I bought 3 norelco trimmers and all of them would cut my beard uneven.</li>
            <li> I spent another 30 minutes cleaning up all the MISSED HAIRS and still ended up with 10 % of the hairs being missed.  </li>
            <li> not what I expected.</li>
            <li> The wet shaving feature also works to expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, since you can trim wet you can prevent beard flake snow time.</li>
            <li> Just be careful to watch what side of the dial you are on</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;cons: you have to go over the same spot few times to get it even.</li>
            <li> Not much power with this one.</li>
            <li> BEFORE YOU BUY: Remember that wet hair is longer and harder to trim.</li>
            <li> With just one or two passes, it leaves my facial hair neatly trimmed without any uneven spots.</li>
            <li> : Not really a con yet, but</li>
            <li> the rubber housing keeps the shaver from slipping in your wet hands...</li>
            <li> shaving my head, I decided to try the wet function, and use it in the shower.</li>
            <li> Nicer than expected.</li>
            <li> If your a hairy guy like me and is tired of using several different shavers for your entire body this is the way to go.</li>
            <li> .. it cuts the thin skin very easily.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> so no comment on performance as a wet trimmer.  </li>
            <li> I never got my beard to look even, and when I wasn&#x27;t careful enough I ended up with an uneven cut.</li>
            <li> But who really cares about all of that if it doesn&#x27;t work worth a crap.</li>
            <li> On Round 2 I spent about 45 minutes in the shower and had to hit some areas twice and had to hit the hair from ALL DIFFERENT ANGLES to shave it off.  </li>
            <li> charging base is nice -</li>
            <li> The guides are short and rounded which allows you to get into tight areas, without  poking or gouging, and the cutter does not load up with trimmings like the other trimmers I have used.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste time with a vacuum enabled trimmer to catch trimmings.</li>
            <li> I usually keep a trimmed beard - sometimes long while other times I like to keep it real short.</li>
            <li> My previous trimmer had an issue where occasionally the clip would snap down a length while using it</li>
            <li> I have been using this clipper on my face, head, back, and a few other places.</li>
            <li> What I mean is, as far as the other comments and You Tube Vids were concerned  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Can be used in the shower or under other wet conditions&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> However that was not very powerful.</li>
            <li> Very quiet and consistent cutting length.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have the time to go over the same area to be trimmed multiple times, this is not a good product.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for trimming my beard based on some decent reviews, after trying it a couple of times it simply is a poor product.</li>
            <li> but it loses major points if not all from me because the guard is not removable.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It gets sometimes annoying putting it in the charging base, but if you use it more often than me, I&#x27;m sure it will be a second nature</li>
            <li> Sadly, this new trimmer with sharp blades did the same thing.  </li>
            <li> The cutting dial allows for highly precise length adjustments, from 1mm to 10mm, in half millimeter intervals along the way.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer feels solid but a few things make I less than desirable to me.</li>
            <li> Other than that issue, this trimmer cuts evenly and efficiently, while making changes in a length a</li>
            <li> Maybe other color options for the rubber would be nice?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> could go on with some of the other comments I&#x27;ve seen about parts snapping off or something --</li>
            <li> could go on with some of the other comments I&#x27;ve seen about parts snapping off or something --</li>
            <li> To think of all the time I wasted, I should have bought this long ago.</li>
            <li> It is made to have a substance to make the facial hair/skin slick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d look at other options</li>
            <li> Other than</li>
            <li> But frankly, I have no more energy to put into explaining my situation further.  </li>
            <li> So why do you allow this item to be sold to Australia when rightfully, you block other products from being allowed to be sold to me?</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does need to be cleaned and oiled after every wet use.&lt;br /&gt; $10 cheaper than at walmart!</li>
            <li> would not recommend other to buy it .</li>
            <li> That said, these are extremely well made and sturdy (no jiggling parts)</li>
            <li> and I use it about every other day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed in Panasonic because most of my house hold electronics are Panasonic brand.</li>
            <li> I got these clippers the other day.</li>
            <li> It has remained sharp (keep the oil maintenance up) for the months that I have owned it.</li>
            <li> This is not really a problem for my beard, which is relatively average.</li>
            <li> BY chance you do use it from other side with the start button facing you,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had other beard trimmers/razors and they did not come close to this model.</li>
            <li> 15 hours is a pretty absurd amount of time to charge anything from a wall outlet.</li>
            <li> Because my face is not quite GQ material, I always end up getting a pretty uncomfortable trim from all of those I have tried.  </li>
            <li> a go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the things I could not stand with the other trimmers is keeping up with all of those dang hair guards.  </li>
            <li> Grab this one for this area and then remove it, put the other one for that...</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m not exactly a trimmer</li>
            <li> The only problem I have yet to encounter with this is the small shaving head.  </li>
            <li> The answering folks usually have no technical knowledge of the parts of products and  models.  </li>
            <li> My wife cut my hair in the fraction of the time it took with these other tools.  </li>
            <li> If I put pressure on an area it will cut it shorter than other areas.</li>
            <li> have had other</li>
            <li> Contrary to other Amazon reviewers opinions</li>
            <li> Razor sharp.</li>
            <li> it also doesn&#x27;t do sharp edges so you will need another tool for that</li>
            <li> I bought this for my grown son as a gift to replace his other one.</li>
            <li> I always feel like the batteries are almost dead even though it&#x27;s on the charger all the time and has been like that as long as I&#x27;ve had it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve purchased several trimmers by different makers before this, to a one, the motors in them were all rather weak seeming.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what regular use is to everyone else</li>
            <li> /&gt;To summarise; if you need a small, quiet trimmer to groom your bread with; this is a product that i can recommend to you.</li>
            <li> Quieter than other trimmers that I have used&lt;br</li>
            <li> and they cut extremely well.  </li>
            <li> Only small annoyance is oiling it before and after each use.</li>
            <li> I bought this product based on the other reviews I had read and let me say it did not disappoint.</li>
            <li> It cuts even and the blades are sharp.</li>
            <li> It takes easily 4x as long as using a corded Wahl trimmer, and it comes out uneven and botched with this trimmer anyway.</li>
            <li> The unit works well enough, but oiling it according to instructions seems excessive.</li>
            <li> I bought the Panasonic ER-GB40-S based on recommendations from other sites instead of sticking with what I know works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried 3 other trimmers and they were all junk compared to this one.</li>
            <li> Second, there&#x27;s a small groove in the comb in which the hair is not obstructed by the blade.  </li>
            <li> I have used it for extended periods of time and the battery never bogs down and it cuts thru the hair just as expected.</li>
            <li> The vacuum feature adds bulk but usually saves your sink and counter from man hair.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s too bad, because it won&#x27;t be easy to improvise one.</li>
            <li> Requires a decent bit of maintenance and attention, and makes some odd noises when it&#x27;s not happy with the way you&#x27;re using it.</li>
            <li> I thought the random long strand after a trim was normal.</li>
            <li> Pull of the adjustable head, rinse off the cutting head, put a couple drops of oil on it, drop it in the charger and I&#x27;m ready for next time.</li>
            <li> Cutting lengths adjust quickly.  </li>
            <li> When in the base it lights up a red light.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very good for lining, but overall I like it.  </li>
            <li> I recently cut it down to about 1/4&amp;#34; and I understood why a few other reviewers was saying it cut unevenly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although the product is also labeled as a &amp;#34;body&amp;#34; trimmer, it is really too small for that, and as mentioned above, it is difficult to get an even shave.</li>
            <li> Has trouble with cutting my hair, which is pretty short.</li>
            <li> , this I guess, is what it must have felt like to go from black &amp; white to color, nothing wrong with black &amp; white, it entertains just like its color counterpart but the presentation is a different beast altogether.  </li>
            <li> , this I guess, is what it must have felt like to go from black &amp; white to color, nothing wrong with black &amp; white, it entertains just like its color counterpart but the presentation is a different beast altogether.  </li>
            <li> No, really, with the guard removed it likes to take little nips here and there and will snag and pull hair.</li>
            <li> The trimmer seems to be made well and functions well, but the head is a little too wide and bulky to give me an even trim over all parts of my beard.  </li>
            <li> the correct length on the other half.</li>
            <li> This was a lot of bulk and not worthy of other trimmers out there.  </li>
            <li> It also bites hard occasionally.</li>
            <li> It just has a really hard time trimming all of the hairs, so it takes going back over and over trying to get the stragglers cut evenly.</li>
            <li> That has been a big help and cuts down on the mess that is left behind after shaving in the sink.</li>
            <li> Not powerful enough to trim my hair easily, hard to trim evenly.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t felt that typical low battery slow down that I associate with other cordless models.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this trimmer, is that its made of a rougher plastic (at least the guard is anyway)</li>
            <li> And I have no useful response and no idea how to get this</li>
            <li> My only real complaint is that even on the highest setting it trims too short.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is it doesn&#x27;t let you know when its fully charged.  </li>
            <li> Anyone who gave this trimmer 5 stars must be working with Beiber like scruff because this trimmer is useless for someone that actually wants to keep one even length.</li>
            <li> One complaint I have is it doesn&#x27;t get close to remove short stubble around my neck</li>
            <li> I have used at least once a week for several months now</li>
            <li> He is the one using it daily and hasn&#x27;t complained..</li>
            <li> Only negative is lack of a &amp;#34;charged/</li>
            <li> The only negative it you have to go over a couple of times to get an even cut.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the instructions say do not use the charger in the bathroom.  </li>
            <li> , It&#x27;s rather average.</li>
            <li> I run it all the way out on the longest setting... for an average beard length.  </li>
            <li> The product is good, the customer support is the worst.</li>
            <li> In fairness, it hasn&#x27;t broken yet, but I won&#x27;t be surprised when it does.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After a few months of minimal use (once or twice a week) it would no longer hold a charge.</li>
            <li> Those with a very long beard or one that is very thick and curly might have a different opinion, but for the rest of us</li>
            <li> Uneven cutting, small head, and guide clogs easily.  </li>
            <li> Another annoying thing is - for such a small unit, they could have easily made it for 110V to 230V range.</li>
            <li> Had a beard down to my lower chest, and took this to it with no issues whatsoever.</li>
            <li> moves up or down.  </li>
            <li> When going around ANY contour on your face the contours fall into this gap and it gets shaved down to the skin as if you were using no guard.</li>
            <li> I think I used it 3 or 4 times before it sounded like it was running down,</li>
            <li> But if I set down and my wife uses it to touch-up my dooo</li>
            <li> The deal for me is I have a Wahl for that, so this was just money down the drain for me.</li>
            <li> I now have to hold the guide down while shaving.</li>
            <li> bought this after my Philips QT4050 broke from fall down a flight of stairs.  </li>
            <li> why couldn&#x27;t they go down to 0mm</li>
            <li> Although I recommend you start with the thickest setting and work your way down.  </li>
            <li> It is that sharp!</li>
            <li> I mean like whisper quiet.</li>
            <li> Head and shoulders above what I used in the past!  </li>
            <li> Sadly, the trimmer in action falls far short of the less expensive Braun.</li>
            <li> unlike other beard trimmers, i get an even shave with few (if any) missed/ stray hairs.</li>
            <li> Blades seem to be made with quality and are very sharp.</li>
            <li> but I believe the ergonomics issue design of the shaver plus the human body (ex. difficultto shave lower leg due to bone or knee due to thin skin surrounding it etc.)</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not a huge deal as all of the other benefits make up for it by far.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, their quality steadily going down.</li>
            <li> Combine this with the fact that one who typically uses a trimmer instead of a close-shaver will have longer hair to trim, and you can wind up with a bit of a mess on the sink and down all over yourself.  </li>
            <li> and I looked up to see that it had literally trimmed to the skin on one half of my chin and</li>
            <li> It takes less than 30 seconds to do this.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t paying attention and shaved off half my bear in one stroke because I thought it was an 10</li>
            <li> Typical Panasonic quality shaving device.  </li>
            <li> Less than a year in</li>
            <li> That said, wish they&#x27;d go to a lithium ion battery and dump the nickel hydroxide for a longer/faster charge, less weight, and longer battery life.  </li>
            <li> no having to plug it in half war through your trimming.</li>
            <li> AT HALF THE PRICE .</li>
            <li> However taking it off does feel odd sometimes, and sometimes it does feel like you have to force it off</li>
            <li> My previous trimmer was a $15 Con Air corded trimmer that I used for about 6 years before deciding I wanted to go cordless.</li>
            <li> I previously tried a Remington do it yourself cutter that did the job but was time consuming.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d add half a star</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re half awake</li>
            <li> all the previous review lies..</li>
            <li> I bought this less than 2 months ago...</li>
            <li> I have this problem MUCH less with this trimmer than I do with the trimmer built into my shaver, but it still happens from time to time.  </li>
            <li> The shaver motor died after less than 18 months.</li>
            <li> One huge flaw that kills it and renders it useless: the guide is attached in such a cheap manner that it is terrible hard to remove or attach, and breaks after a few uses.</li>
            <li> My wife loves that I can use it in the shower instead of making a mess at the sink.</li>
            <li> The trimmer still works like new, but hubby shorted out the charger by plugging it into the wrong voltage whilst travelling.  </li>
            <li> Too small a cutting area to be useful.</li>
            <li> The clippers are alittle narrower than my previous trimmer, and it took a few times to get used to that.</li>
            <li> Really quiet with a weak motor.</li>
            <li> Have used other trimmers in the past.</li>
            <li> My beard was about 1.5 to 2 with a little longer goat.</li>
            <li> However I sometimes like my beard to be a little longer</li>
            <li> Box looked a little ruffed up.</li>
            <li> A little pricey&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The comb felt a little flimsy in my hand but holds up well when in use.</li>
            <li> It works as well as my other 10 cheapo trimmer, but not better than it.</li>
            <li> , it comes with a little bottle of oil and according to the instructions, it says you are supposed to oil it before AND after EVERY use.</li>
            <li> Also, you can take the little guard thing off and it rocks at doing fine-tune edge work.</li>
            <li> As soon as I got it out of the box and charged and turned on, it sounded a bit weak compared to my last trimmer.  </li>
            <li> It does seem a little underpowered.</li>
            <li> Little or no pulling.</li>
            <li> There is little to dislike in these trimmers.  </li>
            <li> The little manual does not show/mention them at all.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The plastic attachment is a little bit flimsy.</li>
            <li> I have little roomin</li>
            <li> My only reservation is what I perceive as possibly being a weak battery or weak motor</li>
            <li> These little attachments banged around in my bathroom getting lost and making a nuisance of themselves.</li>
            <li> After that little mishap, I paid closer attention to what I was doing, and have no complaints.  </li>
            <li> I did a little research before purchasing this trimmer.</li>
            <li> The combs do have a little give, but not a significant amount and the combs remain in place even if you apply a bit of force while pressing the trimmers against your face.  </li>
            <li> had I wanted a little bit of beard.</li>
            <li> I have used several beard trimmers over the years and this is easily the worst.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the precision when it comes to hair cut length (0.5mm increments) but it does a poor job cutting compared to a typical hair clipper.</li>
            <li> Very unfortunate, due to the fact that I really like Panasonic products.</li>
            <li> Very bad did not work with me, but only one day and tried to communicate with the seller, and so I could not Adhan abused as worthy assessment of the piece and may be faulty at the item and found I do not blame this model to read</li>
            <li> It was a little closer than I prefer it to be for a few days.</li>
            <li> for the ability to be used wet, I suppose that&#x27;s technically true, but the weak power makes cutting slick hair</li>
            <li> power cord cannot be separated from charging base (no way you can pack it for travel without taking a huge space in your bag)&lt;br /&gt;- no movable head</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Again, I&#x27;m not saying there has never been a defective product shipped, but I will say this thing is really heavy and sturdy and well...</li>
            <li> Again, I&#x27;m not saying there has never been a defective product shipped, but I will say this thing is really heavy and sturdy and well...</li>
            <li> yourself the trouble, time, and aggravation with dealing with sub-par trimmers.  </li>
            <li> All in all, I wouldn&#x27;t waste your time with this product.</li>
            <li> There are a couple of reasons I say it is not a great trimmer and therefore only gets 4 stars.  </li>
            <li> Used it on my legs and got zip for my trouble....</li>
            <li> It leaves uneven surface.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s width keeps it from getting into uneven parts of my face.  </li>
            <li> Leaves uneven patches all over the place.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s missing</li>
            <li> Works well with quite a few adjustments that meet my needs.</li>
            <li> I use that for a hair cut and found it is too narrow and result not smooth hair cut.</li>
            <li> I am still undecided on whether to return it,  I just doesn&#x27;t seem to have the power, it always sounds like it needs to be charged, like the battery is going dead, it continues to work</li>
            <li> Ive tried a few body shavers.  </li>
            <li> but the battery kept going dead</li>
            <li> but maybe I just don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m missing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s MESSY though.</li>
            <li> But it gets the job done everyday.</li>
            <li> though you killed my beard Panasonic, you still get a 5 star.</li>
            <li> The water proof part of this product is gimmicky.</li>
            <li> you are in trouble.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks</li>
            <li> which is a waste of time.</li>
            <li> (you have to guess the angle correct, otherwise you&#x27;ll end up with uneven beard sizes through your face.</li>
            <li> He uses it everyday..</li>
            <li> are a few things to consider about this clipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The guard cracked while trying to remove it after a few uses.</li>
            <li> Husband loves this replacement, bought to replace a dead unit.</li>
            <li> you must take care of the blade and the charger as they are not cheap to replace.</li>
            <li> Went a week without trimming and it had the power to cut without missing hairs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars because I think it&#x27;s lacking a few things.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned the Panasonic ER224S as well as the Norelco BodyGroom, both of which are broken in some way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Panasonic ER224S was finicky to adjust and the &#x27;plastic guard&#x27; (of which there is only one) broke at the corner and would not stay on.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of the few that was wet/dry</li>
            <li> What a waste of $45.</li>
            <li> /&gt;the trimmer has few settings to change how close of a shave u want.</li>
            <li> few passes)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;To sum up why you shouldn&#x27;t waste your money on this trimmer:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> To make matters worse, they provide no storage for the lubricating oil that you are supposed to use daily.</li>
            <li> This happens within just a few minutes of turning it on despite having fully charged the item.</li>
            <li> Bought for my son who has a heavy beard; he loves it.  </li>
            <li> B0009OMU0A Remington MB-200 Titanium Mustache and Beard Trimmer]], turned out to be a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> This trimmer cuts uneven and leaves straggler hairs.</li>
            <li> and I wouldn&#x27;t buy anything with a poor overall rating.</li>
            <li> The thin plastic holders for the head broke the third time I used this.  </li>
            <li> The cutter is quite narrow as well.  </li>
            <li> ; one day it was working, next time I tried to use it, it was broken.</li>
            <li> would recommend the ER-BG40-S but deducted one star to the narrow blade openings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like the water clean-up and solid charging base.</li>
            <li> to long to use and charge, instructions were vague and not clear.</li>
            <li> Not a huge deal, but the limiting factor on this device.</li>
            <li> FYI - the red LED does Not go out once fully charged, it just stays illuminated the whole time the shaver is in the base.)  </li>
            <li> the only  thing I can say is bad about it is kinda hard to clean behind the blades without taking the shaver head off.</li>
            <li> No matter how long it charges it seems to run slow!</li>
            <li> slow to trim compared to other trimmers, leaves a lot of hair untrimmed.</li>
            <li> However for lining and edging the motor is not strong at all.</li>
            <li> Is not strong as they promote in the commercials.</li>
            <li> I use it mainly to tame body hair and keep my beard trim.</li>
            <li> It has a very odd removal and reinstallation of the guard leading this to happen.</li>
            <li> tame the hairy animal.  </li>
            <li> Shave in the shower, avoid making a mess around your sink!</li>
            <li> When I can hear it run a little slower than usual, I oil it</li>
            <li> The fact that the Panasonic can be charged and doesn&#x27;t need batteries is of no value when you consider the weak motor, the very long  time needed to recharge the battery, and no indicator to tell you when it needs to be recharged.</li>
            <li> I tried it out and it seemed alright for the first week or so, but it eventually just pooped out and the already weak motor slowed down to the point where the blades were grabbing hairs instead of cutting them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the reason I have a beard in the first place--too painful to shave.  </li>
            <li> I had really hoped this product would perform as well as other Panasonic products I have owned, but was sadly disappointed.</li>
            <li> Not cheap or flimsy like others I&#x27;ve had in the past...  </li>
            <li> Despite the minute adjustment steps, the results, at least on my beard, are so uneven that it makes little difference.</li>
            <li> Tried using this for a few weeks, but at 1.5mm to 2.5mm, it has a *very* uneven trim and is basically unusable.</li>
            <li> But the maintenance instructions are one terse paragraph, and not a single illustration, not even a lousy line drawing.</li>
            <li> I was extremely disappointed right out of the box</li>
            <li> After using first day my charger got dead :(</li>
            <li> I was afraid this would not be able to do all the cutting I need it to do</li>
            <li> Leave it in the ugly charger dock for couple of hours and can&#x27;t even last a 20 minutes facial trim.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have little hairs all over my sink!  </li>
            <li> I usually just eat the cost of a personal care item like this if it doesn&#x27;t work, but this is so bad, I simply must return it out of principle.</li>
            <li> have thick, coarse facial hair, which makes shaving/trimming very difficult.  </li>
            <li> the guard on the razor just kept bouncing across the skin but cut very little.  </li>
            <li> It does clip well but very little power.</li>
            <li> The main complaint I have is the depth of the cutting blade is inconsistent.</li>
            <li> Only thing, it is a little narrow across the cutting area..</li>
            <li> and they were absolutely horrendously bad.</li>
            <li> After a handful of uses, the retractable head cracked rendering the entire thing useless.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a beard for the past five years, and have struggled to find a trimmer that i didn&#x27;t have to run over my face 4-5 times to trim all the hair.</li>
            <li> For that, I prefer my small Gillette trimmer that operates on a AA battery.  </li>
            <li> but I am not satisfied.</li>
            <li> And in between the guard I can see small hair trimmings</li>
            <li> I trust Panasonic as usual.</li>
            <li> The only issue I have is with the weird</li>
            <li> setting it in the charger is a must for lazy people like myself</li>
            <li> A small brush, oil for the blades, cleaning instructions.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is small and fits in the hand, so the sink space that it requires is minimal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Whoever designed this trimmer should be shaved in random spots and sent out into the public to apologize.</li>
            <li> do however have 2 small complaints about this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> no more settling for the closest setting.</li>
            <li> If you have thick hair it has some trouble.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable close hair cut.</li>
            <li> Pouring water into a small hole to remove tiny bits of hair gets tedious.</li>
            <li> If you find those few &amp;#34;wild&amp;#34; hairs that always come up, this will get them!</li>
            <li> I am not one to usually write a review</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not exactly sure you could call the trim at 5mm a beard.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, it is a convenient solution for the money, but I really do not love it.</li>
            <li> The Norelcos I had before had a small spring that automatically adjusted the &#x27;attack angle&#x27;)&lt;br</li>
            <li> A bit on the heavy side!</li>
            <li> The blades seem to run too slow, and it feels like an uneven trim when finished.  </li>
            <li> I was not able to drain the battery in my testing.</li>
            <li> The blade is too small for this application.</li>
            <li> I was not able to drain the battery in my testing.</li>
            <li> This is inconvenient, but barber&#x27;s clippers are supposed to be oiled up frequently as well.</li>
            <li> do have a couple of small complaints.  </li>
            <li> so was anxious to &amp;#34;upgrade&amp;#34; as it was time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have had terrible experience with most cordless trimmers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll have to figure out the MM adjustments as the combs I&#x27;ve used in the past</li>
            <li> instructions call for oiling it after every use (not sure why or how to do</li>
            <li> I usually use the shortest setting or the longest.  </li>
            <li> My needs are not many: keep my beard and mustache trimmed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten really lazy and seldom oil it.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend you get lazy too, but if you do, it&#x27;s not the end of the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The trimmer blades must be oiled after each use and a small container of oil is included.  </li>
            <li> One thing that I also love about it, is that it doesn&#x27;t pull or tug my hairs, which could be very annoying and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how the men&#x27;s health award was given to this razor.</li>
            <li> have used this twice a week for the past year...</li>
            <li> I usually charge it up once a week and trim 3 times per week</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled by this one&#x27;s streamlined looks, you have to go over and over your face numerous times to get even a mediocre trim.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it is a design fault or a one off.</li>
            <li> she was trying to use the trimmer, she asked me if the battery was dying, because the motor seemed so sluggish, I told her that it had been charging for the past 18 hours or so.</li>
            <li> (Yes, a small brush is included.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> * Adjustable, but not very powerful for tough jobs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Bought here, and was very exceited to receive it, but I will make an attempt to return as it left me very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also pretty certain that I have some affliction that causes, random, nasty in-grown</li>
            <li> but as I understand things very few trimmers do that anyway.</li>
            <li> I got sick of my old trimmers with the 10+ attachments, half of which I never used, and they just fell on the floor all the time.</li>
            <li> That seems a little ridiculous to me.</li>
            <li> Replaced an older trimmer and now realize how bad it was.....</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s terrible only works when it wants.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just tired of all the things I have to drag out just to charge something, at least make it so the cord just plugs in if I want.</li>
            <li> The motor is really weak and it takes almost three times longer to trim my beard than with my previous trimmer that was battery operated.</li>
            <li> By the time I quit, my beard looked like a bad joke from an \\&quot;as seen on TV\\&quot; commercial, showing how the other guy&#x27;s trimmer leaves you patchy.</li>
            <li> So far the shaver is holding up well, but it is very difficult to get an even shave on your face.  </li>
            <li> A little weak on power, but gets the job done otherwise.  </li>
            <li> This is easily the worst trimmer i have ever encountered.</li>
            <li> Only, minor grief:</li>
            <li> I was replacing a very old, inexpensive beard trimmer because the blades were dull and snagged on my beard which was painful.  </li>
            <li> I wish it comes with hard carrying</li>
            <li> Hard to beat rechargeable.</li>
            <li> Maybe when the blades begin to dull...</li>
            <li> it is hard to get under you nose and edges of lips</li>
            <li> So far I have not found anything bad about how the unit works.</li>
            <li> This bad boy, however, addresses every need my face has, and that it&#x27;s completely waterproof is the icing on the cake.  </li>
            <li> ;: Um... use some common sense here.</li>
            <li> people who complain about having to reapply oil after WASHING IT OFF probably also have clumsy hands and don&#x27;t pay attention to the way they are supposed to push/pull something and just break</li>
            <li> people who complain about having to reapply oil after WASHING IT OFF probably also have clumsy hands and don&#x27;t pay attention to the way they are supposed to push/pull something and just break</li>
            <li> works well, but my biggest complaint is that it should have a longer beard trim length</li>
            <li> Probably too late to get it replaced this time.  </li>
            <li> I found my self popping off the blades at least twice per trimming session to rinse all of the hair out.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> At least I can return it.</li>
            <li> I like it and use it at least 3 times a week.</li>
            <li> so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One negative-</li>
            <li> The charger died in late July 2014.</li>
            <li> Writing this at least a year after buying the trimmer.</li>
            <li> Product sucks.</li>
            <li> charging stand does have a negative.  </li>
            <li> I use it at least twice a week.</li>
            <li> -- It&#x27;s on-par with $10 trimmers and at least those you can get closer shaves with by removing the head.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Oh and it doesn&#x27;t pinch in delicate areas.</li>
            <li> The power button is located on the bottom which means that it is awkward to turn on the trimmer from the same position as you would hold it while using</li>
            <li> Double disappointment from Panasonic.</li>
            <li> do get at least 3 shaves head &amp; beard before recharging.</li>
            <li> You do have to make multiple passes while cutting hair.</li>
            <li> Works well, stays charged, at least at about months.</li>
            <li> used it at least 6 time and it is still going strong.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Takes 1 pass to trim even thick beards.</li>
            <li> My beard hairs are thick and wiry.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a thick moustache or goatee</li>
            <li> But compared to my corded Wahl unit it cuts less efficiently and the cutting width is about half what the Wahl&#x27;s is.  </li>
            <li> the motor will begin to slow down and the cutting action suffers.</li>
            <li> Not many!</li>
            <li> holding it with the flat part of the comb against my face is awkward.</li>
            <li> which would mean you&#x27;d have to remove two screws to gain access to the inside of the head.</li>
            <li> No more combs to break!</li>
            <li> Was a little disappointed when I read the manual and found that it&#x27;s recommended to oil the blade after each use and before the next use.  </li>
            <li> And I don&#x27;t even mean beaver pelt man-face covering kinds of beards.&lt;br</li>
            <li> did buy some oil for the trimmer even though it comes with a very small bottle.</li>
            <li> and you have to remove to very small screws to get to one of the places to oil.</li>
            <li> Who out there is seriously using their beard trimmer for 50 minutes in one use???</li>
            <li> Who out there is seriously using their beard trimmer for 50 minutes in one use???</li>
            <li> The trimmer is too expensive for the charger to stop working in less than a year.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t consider any of these complaints to be serious.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t consider any of these complaints to be serious.</li>
            <li> After only 10 months it never held a charge and Panasonic was the worst to deal with, they just would not back up the product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too weak, I need at least five minutes just to cut the bear of 3 days.</li>
            <li> I have a thick beard and it is just too weak for my liking.</li>
            <li> Not really impressed with its tight trimming capability because you still need a razor to finish off</li>
            <li> Alas, the blade width is frustratingly small and the motor is weak.  </li>
            <li> As a haircutting tool it was a little tedious</li>
            <li> such a bad job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s bad, especially considering I use it just once per week.</li>
            <li> Not a good product....</li>
            <li> I have never purchased anything on amazon that was not a good product</li>
            <li> Not good as a beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> Comb design is not good.</li>
            <li> It is really difficult to get off, and in just two weeks I think that I&#x27;ve already broken the pieces that hold the comb down.  </li>
            <li> really weak machine ..shaving surface is really narrow  was not impressed .</li>
            <li> Hard to believe I&#x27;ve had this for 1 1/2 years!</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that there is no place on the base to hold the brush.</li>
            <li> As long as Panasonic will sell replacements, the situation is not too bad.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Now to address the common criticisms, which don&#x27;t make a lot of sense to me honestly:&lt;br /&gt;~ &amp;#34;I have to oil it after every use!</li>
            <li> I like the all in one guide, I like the docking station, however motor is weak.</li>
            <li> Pros: quite, ergonomic shape, water-proof&lt;br /&gt;Cons: weak, underpowered motor.</li>
            <li> Pretty disgusted and amazed.</li>
            <li> The MOTOR is a weak pile</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had two other different non-Panasonic models that were awful.  </li>
            <li> I bought this to trim body hair and it&#x27;s really weak.  </li>
            <li> The motor is WEAK.</li>
            <li> It is a bit annoying for everyday or every other day use, but it does make a convenient traveller.</li>
            <li> A bit disappointed that it only lasted a year.</li>
            <li> The recommended oil (included) makes it very hard to get all the hair out</li>
            <li> the blood makes you look tough.</li>
            <li> The dial allows for all, I mean all, lengths and styles!  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!!!</li>
            <li> documentation is poor.</li>
            <li> Even worse: When the guide is removed for trimming, it pulls my hair.</li>
            <li> Not happy.</li>
            <li> not great...</li>
            <li> so long in fact that by the time I discovered the charger dilemma the time frame in which I could return the product had expired. :(</li>
            <li> This is not adjustable, so the trimmer cuts poorly.</li>
            <li> Had a broken trimmer head blade after a couple weeks of use.</li>
            <li> decided to keep this Panasonic because I was tired of shopping around, and had already returned a [[ASIN:B00ARF428O Philips Norelco Multigroom]] which had the flimsiest attachments one could imagine.</li>
            <li> I was extremely annoyed about it.</li>
            <li> It is thin and lightweight</li>
            <li> That was frustrating</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not great.</li>
            <li> No warranty, poor form.</li>
            <li> Even the charging base is solid...</li>
            <li> Not a great buzzer to use on your chest.</li>
            <li> Not happy at all</li>
            <li> You know, not just leave behind stubble&#x27;s but</li>
            <li> Poor battery life on a product that is used once a week forces me to downgrade this to one star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another annoying thing about this trimmer is that when the base is plugged in &amp; the trimmer is placed in the base, a red light turns on.</li>
            <li> There is very little power or cutting ability with this model.</li>
            <li> again a disappointment in a past shaver.</li>
            <li> No more dirty sink</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well made but the cutting blades are extremely small.  </li>
            <li> To me, that would indicate that the trimmer&#x27;s contact points are properly aligned in the base, and the base is plugged in, and the trimmer is actively charging.</li>
            <li> The one real complaint is the removable head.  </li>
            <li> And it cuts without the annoying tugging and pulling of other shavers.  </li>
            <li> Not your usual boring black device.</li>
            <li> power button is not easy to switch on and off.&lt;br /&gt;The shaver can only install into the base one way, and it is a bit awkward to insert into the base...</li>
            <li> It also can handle a tough beard with no problem!</li>
            <li> Cutting power are also weak ..</li>
            <li> After 12 months ownership the charger no longer works, so unit is useless.</li>
            <li> The length dial for trimming is useless, thank god</li>
            <li> if I am using it wrong please share you wisdom&lt;</li>
            <li> Am sorry.</li>
            <li> Yeah, what the heck was wrong with these guys?</li>
            <li> than everything being set back-side-forward, there is nothing wrong with the performance with the unit.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s difficult for me to compare to any others.</li>
            <li> so why buy an expensive one.  </li>
            <li> It is a grooming game changer!</li>
            <li> LAME.</li>
            <li> He is unable to do so because the surface that trims the hair is too small.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Within 5 minutes your charger will become useless.</li>
            <li> Another is that it&#x27;s a bit difficult getting all the mustache hairs even</li>
            <li> /&gt;It comes with a charging stand, but unfortunately there&#x27;s no way of knowing when it&#x27;s fully charged.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m so sad and angry</li>
            <li> WTF??</li>
            <li> He is difficult to please and raves about this brand and model.</li>
            <li> Not perfect,</li>
            <li> and Ill get another when this one breaks.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to get on and off.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> BTW, the Panasonic nose trimmer I bought at around the same time is similarly terrible.</li>
            <li> Sorry, I&#x27;m not a speed</li>
            <li> problem could be with the charging stand, though, since it seemed difficult to seat the trimmer in it correctly to make contact with the charging posts.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re drunk.</li>
            <li> Proved to be nearly useless.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This was false on their part and they charged me a 15% restocking fee!</li>
            <li> Very poor at mustache trimming.  </li>
            <li> Attached by two very thin pieces of plastic that snap into unit, and I am just waiting for them to break.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li> Worst $50 ever spent.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;drag factor\\&quot; with the razor on skin was unbelievably terrible...</li>
            <li> That pointless experiment failed miserably.  </li>
            <li> but the 15 hours charge cycle is a disappointment.  </li>
            <li> its cutting edge is  too narrow.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> Because of this, figuring out how to disassemble the trimmer was a nervous process; I was afraid I was going to break it.</li>
            <li> A really disappointing flaw.</li>
            <li> Then, what I was afraid of happening...happened.</li>
            <li> I bought a Lithium-Ion based unit, instead -- which requires no oil or crazy charge times, and can be used while charging.</li>
            <li> I have a Wahl hair cutting system and it&#x27;s 15 years and still going.  </li>
            <li> So I did not have to go crazy looking for a shorter length.</li>
            <li> It also will adjust the cutting length automatically.  </li>
            <li> the cutting blades were sharper and faster without the guard for nose and ear hair trimming.</li>
            <li> After yet another extended and disappointing experience with my Braun CruZer (think I owned a 5, so I can&#x27;t comment on the 6)</li>
            <li> My lord, does this thing suck at cutting.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t take multi voltage disappointing product.</li>
            <li> This has a charging stand, so you can&#x27;t keep it plugged in while cutting.</li>
            <li> then it stopped cutting well.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to go crazy on this review</li>
            <li> You have to push the cutting blade with your thumb which seems counter intuitive</li>
            <li> My husband stopped shaving for No Beard November 2013, and by January I was desperate for him to have something to trim up with.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;-The power button is flimsy and awkward to press.&lt;br /&gt;-Although</li>
            <li> The on / off button is inconveniently located&lt;br</li>
            <li> One reviewer was unhappy about having to oil the blades so often.  </li>
            <li> than what I have mentioned, the body and the cutting head seems to be well made and</li>
            <li> Unpleasant surprises after purchase.</li>
            <li> This provides about 30 minutes of very mediocre shave time.</li>
            <li> and this razor is almost impossible to get an even trim on your head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s a testament to how bad this is I returned it to Amazon.</li>
            <li> Is that painfully bad or what?</li>
            <li> I understand that some people might give a bad review because they got a defective product; sometimes that just happens.</li>
            <li> bad irritation to the face.  </li>
            <li> BAD PURCHASED................................................</li>
            <li> one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s too bad</li>
            <li> (poor batteries and awful charging system)  </li>
            <li> It was a painful experience as it caught my hairs and pulled them out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Charging base is a bit awkward</li>
            <li> then I encountered the worst customer service - terrible waste of time.</li>
            <li> I am really disappointed in this product because of the amount of upkeep &amp; maintenance that it requires to keep it functioning.  </li>
            <li> Buy this product and you won&#x27;t be disappointed</li>
            <li> If you buy it you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> it was pressent for my husbend :(((</li>
            <li> I purchased this based on the user reviews and I was extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> i am really disappointed</li>
            <li> I tried this on my chest hair and got disappointed.</li>
            <li> I recommend to anyone trust me you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> how is it suppose to sit in that ugly base..</li>
            <li> Also the charging base is well designed.</li>
            <li> This piece of crap pulls my hair.</li>
            <li> Also, continually oiling it is annoying but what can you do...</li>
            <li> This is a bit crap.</li>
            <li> Additionally, I hate these trimmer units that require some sort of a charging base to charge the thing.  </li>
            <li> Problem solved, although I irrationally find it annoying to take fifteen seconds to oil it after every use.  </li>
            <li> It comes with a separate stand which holds the trimmer upright and has a charger in the base.</li>
            <li> The fingers hit your nose and the blades can&#x27;t get to the hairs close to the base of your nose.</li>
            <li> There must have been a change in manufacturing because as it functions now it&#x27;s worthless.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll hate yourself with this.</li>
            <li> This product, however, is worthless.</li>
            <li> It gives an awful cut and is worthless.</li>
            <li> very disappointed.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s plenty of horrible trimmers out there with a couple of set attachments; with this one you can adjust in 0.5mm increments with JUST ONE attachment to keep up with (and clean!!!)&lt;br /&gt;~</li>
            <li> This is the worst buzzer I have every purchased.  </li>
            <li> Fairly disgusting.</li>
            <li> Truly a terrible razor.</li>
            <li> How stupid is that!!</li>
            <li> Truly a terrible razor, don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> awful rips your hair out and doesn&#x27;t shave close at all</li>
            <li> Battery is horrible.</li>
            <li> This is the worst investment I have ever made in shavers/trimmers.  </li>
            <li> This is a terrible product that pulls your hair.</li>
            <li> but this was the worst item i ever bought.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s terrible with the guard off, grabbing and pulling hair as you&#x27;re trimming stubble</li>
            <li> This was one of the worst purchases on amazon.</li>
            <li> it is absolutely horrible at power.</li>
            <li> motor is just pathetic.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Do NOT buy this product. After a handful of uses, the retractable head cracked rendering the entire thing useless. AVOID AT ALL COST</li>
            <li> Not powerful enough to trim my hair easily, hard to trim evenly.</li>
            <li> I love how I can change between lengths at any time. This is much better than previous trimmers I&#x27;ve used because I would lose some of the trimmer heads. It&#x27;s also a lot quieter than I had expected.</li>
            <li> Uneven cutting, small head, and guide clogs easily.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> This product looks like it would be a really nice trimmer and the overwhelming number of positive reviews would make you think so too, but that WAS NOT the case. The very first time I used this trimmer (was on 7.5mm setting) I was trimming my chin and I looked up to see that it had literally trimmed to the skin on one half of my chin and the correct length on the other half. Giving me a halloween-worthy shave......Worthless product</li>
            <li> Nice trimmer. I use it on my head and beard. Works fine in or out of shower. Included oil keeps it working well.</li>
            <li> This moustache and beard trimmer is woefully under powered. Furthermore, it&#x27;s much smaller than any other trimmer I&#x27;ve owned. If it&#x27;s a testament to how bad this is I returned it to Amazon.</li>
            <li> Really wanted to like this trimmer.  It&#x27;s wet/dry combo is convenient but is severely underpowered for shaving my bald head.  Even body hair takes a few passes and really isn&#x27;t time consuming.  It&#x27;s well built though but the 15 hours charge cycle is a disappointment.  I still go back to my Remington beard trimmer cuz it&#x27;s fast and cuts well.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, glides over the skin very easily, comfortable to hold, charges easily, looks great.</li>
            <li> The best I have had. Even the first two years and a half was awesome, time to change it on the third anniversary.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t do a perfect shave (on zero) not as a razor. But the easy use and the way to cut on different  lengths they are awesome. Never had this neat beard before using this trimmer.</li>
            <li> These do not cut nearly as well as they are touted.</li>
            <li> Keeps my beard nice and trim and easy to use.  Works great wet or dry and never had it run out of power.  For some reason I always want to charge it backwards and put the guard back on after cleaning backwards.  Maybe its me or the design.  It does a great job and is easy to use</li>
            <li> This is an OK buzzer. I use it on the lowest setting without the plastic cover and it take many, many passes to even out my beard. This trimmer is nowhere near as efficient as those in a barbershop. But given the price for this buzzer, the quality is acceptable. The oiling after every use is not as cumbersome as people claim. I only oil it every time if I use it in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had to buy another buzzer I wouldn&#x27;t buy this one, but I&#x27;m not disappointed enough to go through the process of returning it.</li>
            <li> simple to use and easy  great charger.  best buy for the money.</li>
            <li> Got this for my boyfriend for his birthday just as his old trimmer died. He was SUPER impressed with all the settings and that it&#x27;s a Wet &amp; Dry trimmer &amp; shaver all in one. It looks cool, works great, can&#x27;t go wrong. I would definitely recommend!!!</li>
            <li> Really quiet with a weak motor. Gets caught on hairs often. But the settings for hair length is great! More trimmers should use this!</li>
            <li> Not a good product....It yanks my husbands beard while trimming.</li>
            <li> Wow! Best trimmer I have ever had......and I have had many!&lt;br /&gt;One pass....and done. It is that sharp! I love built in adjustable lengths. No attachments! Huge!!!!</li>
            <li> A quality piece of equipment.  My only regret is that it doesn&#x27;t provide guides for timming even longer beards than this.  But, with the exception of a few trimmers, which I felt were of lesser quality, most of them were of similar design.  I like the timmer and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> VERY SATISFIED.DOES A GOOD JOB</li>
            <li> I found the cordless ER-GBRO-S to be great for trimming my beard,mustache and hair. More powerful and smoother than the others mustache and beard trimmers i have owned.The attached comb can be precisely and quickly adjusted or removed for adjusting cutting height.Also did a good job of replacing my hair clippers with the cord,bye bye clippers!</li>
            <li> So the shaver is good for keeping my face the way I like it. But now I can&#x27;t do that because the charger broke just after one month. I don&#x27;t know why or how, but it just doesn&#x27;t charge anymore.</li>
            <li> I have had these for about a week, and so far, they work great.  They cut cleanly, and don&#x27;t pull the hair out, and the dial is very cool, so you can make small adjustments.  When I had just my goatee, I used some scissors to keep it trimmed, but now that I decided to grow a full beard, I needed something to help me not look all duck dynasty, LOL.  I will update after a few months, and that is the only reason for the 4 star rating, will up it to 5 if it is still working great after a few months.</li>
            <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do well. Have used other trimmers in the past. This one is the best so far. No complaints.</li>
            <li> The trimmer itself works well and I never had a problem with the battery.  However, the mechanism for attaching the clipper guard isn&#x27;t really durable.  After a month or two of using the trimmer, the clipper guard doesn&#x27;t clip on anymore.  I called customer support and they&#x27;re sending me a new one for $10.00 (includes shipping).  We&#x27;ll see if it works.</li>
            <li> This is one of the poorer shavers I have used, does not cut evenly, takes  a really long time to trim my beard, doesn&#x27;t really work that well on coarse hair.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely would not recommend this.</li>
            <li> You can use it in water, but my charger broke after the first charging.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Took it out of the package, charged it for the recommended time period and tried to use it. Power was minimal at best and it took a long time to trim my beard. Next day I packaged it up and sent it back.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, but this really is a nice hair and beard trimmer.  Its light, powerful, quiet and does a great job cutting hair.  You can use this for normal haircuts and also as a beard trimmer.  It comes with a dock for charging and the shaver sits in the dock vertically.  The head guard is easy to remove and clean and the precise height adjustment makes it easy to get the right length of cut.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this trimmer, is that its made of a rougher plastic (at least the guard is anyway) and it feels a bit rougher to me when doing hair cuts.  Something about the way the plastic feels as you glide it over your scalp.  Otherwise, its fantastic and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> 1. It&#x27;s designed for left-handed.&lt;br /&gt;2. It doesn&#x27;t work well for shorter length settings.&lt;br /&gt;3. its cutting edge is  too narrow.&lt;br /&gt;4. It&#x27;s easily jammed by hair.&lt;br /&gt;5. Its blade teeth are too dense.</li>
            <li> The best i had, great price, comfortable and excellent construction.&lt;br /&gt;Modern looks, solid, feels comfortable in the hand, great shave.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, not as strong of a motor as I would like.</li>
            <li> Great beard trimmer.  Built in adjust ability is very convenient.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for both your scruff on the face as well as body hair trimming.</li>
            <li> 20 years bearded. Previously owned several trimmers from Phillips/Norelco. Decided to try this one when the battery died on my old one. When close trimming (without the adjustable cap), this unit pulls my hair EVERY time. I&#x27;ve owned it for about 6 months and am abandoning it. Going back to a Norelco for a more comfortable groom. I cannot recommend this unit.</li>
            <li> The adjustable guard will not let you trim defined lines which I feel is a large part of trimming. other than that it is a nice trimmer but it loses major points if not all from me because the guard is not removable.</li>
            <li> This timmer is very easy to use and adjust, also easy to clean.  I highly recommend it for trimming body hair.</li>
            <li> Does a good job on my beard, and I am informed (ahem) that it also works very well for a certain woman to trim around her bikini line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Honey, why are there these long curly hairs in my beard trimmer?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;(muffled laughter from the other room)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do make a point of charging it overnight before you use it, and start at the max setting of 10mm. I made the mistake of starting at the lowest comb setting and plowing right up the middle of my chin. I wound up with little more than 5 o&#x27;clock shadow. Now I use a setting of 6mm for my beard and 10mm for Mr Moustache, but your mileage may vary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The documentation is poor. They devote two full pages to \\&quot;how to trim your beard\\&quot;, with lavish illustrations. But the maintenance instructions are one terse paragraph, and not a single illustration, not even a lousy line drawing. Because of this, figuring out how to disassemble the trimmer was a nervous process; I was afraid I was going to break it. Seriously, not one single illustration of how to take it apart. Is that painfully bad or what?</li>
            <li> Great razor. My husbands chest hair looks so nice and groomed! Yay!Yay! :) I would recommend this to others !</li>
            <li> Nice product. Being able to use it wet or dry is a big plus.</li>
            <li> This is the best cordless beard trimmer I have found.  It cuts great and the built in height adjustment works well, is sturdy, and reduces the need to have a bunch of different attachments.</li>
            <li> Too small a cutting area to be useful. Even worse: When the guide is removed for trimming, it pulls my hair. Ouch! If I could send it back, I would&#x27;ve. It doesn&#x27;t matter that I can use it in the shower, because I just don&#x27;t use it at all. Don&#x27;t make the same mistake I did. Find another model.</li>
            <li> When trying to use the trimmer with no guard it tends to get too close to the skin and bites. Other than that issue, this trimmer cuts evenly and efficiently, while making changes in a length a breeze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was at first concerned that the rolling length selector would change while holding the trimmer in an awkward or offhand position, but I can say that the selection has a very secure click to lock into each length.</li>
            <li> The men in my house love it had to buy another one so Dad could have his own.</li>
            <li> [Pros] Only 1 Attachment for 19 adjustable settings (!!!), waterproof (!!!), ergonomic, powerful enough to not require too many swipes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Cons] None that I&#x27;ve found. Maybe other color options for the rubber would be nice?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the perfect beard trimmer, especially at this price range (was purchased holiday season 2014 for $35). I understand that some people might give a bad review because they got a defective product; sometimes that just happens. That&#x27;s one reason we shop Amazon, it&#x27;s no hassle to get a replacement. -- But 95% of these complaints I&#x27;m seeing really aren&#x27;t legitimate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Allow me to note the strengths of this trimmer, before debunking some of the cons:&lt;br /&gt;~ The 19 Setting Single Attachment: Anyone who really maintains facial hair understands how crucial fine length-settings are. 1 millimeter&#x27;s difference in length of hair on a face is noticeable. There&#x27;s plenty of horrible trimmers out there with a couple of set attachments; with this one you can adjust in 0.5mm increments with JUST ONE attachment to keep up with (and clean!!!)&lt;br /&gt;~ Waterproof: ... ... It&#x27;s waterproof. Want to use it in the shower? It&#x27;s waterproof. Want to clean the head? It&#x27;s waterproof. Beard trimmings sticking to the rubber handle and can&#x27;t be brushed off (an old pet-peeve of mine). IT&#x27;S WATERPROOF.&lt;br /&gt;~ Ergonomics and Power: Pretty simple on this; it fits the hand nicely, the head isn&#x27;t overly large so you can pop off the attachment and do detail work, and the motor provides ample power to clip hair cleanly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now to address the common criticisms, which don&#x27;t make a lot of sense to me honestly:&lt;br /&gt;~ &amp;#34;I have to oil it after every use! Wah wah!&amp;#34;: Um... use some common sense here. The instructions do say to oil it after every use, but... come on guys. Really? It&#x27;s able to be used WET. If you&#x27;re constantly running it through water, would you need to reapply oil more? Sure. Too much work for you? Use it as a dry razor and oil it as you normally would. -- You do not have to oil this any more than any other trimmer, unless of course you are washing away the oil all the time.&lt;br /&gt;~ &amp;#34;Battery no last me long, only 50 minutes. Wah wah!&amp;#34;: ... Ok, I&#x27;m noticing a trend here. Apparently, technology should run on fairy dust and magical rainbow farts or something. Who out there is seriously using their beard trimmer for 50 minutes in one use??? Or even a week??? So... let me get this straight: It&#x27;s too much to ask that this hand-held, waterproof, compact beard-cutting machine be charged for a day once a week. ... ... ... ... Ok Justin Beiber, let&#x27;s go to Spoiled Prince Land.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could go on with some of the other comments I&#x27;ve seen about parts snapping off or something -- Again, I&#x27;m not saying there has never been a defective product shipped, but I will say this thing is really heavy and sturdy and well... people who complain about having to reapply oil after WASHING IT OFF probably also have clumsy hands and don&#x27;t pay attention to the way they are supposed to push/pull something and just break it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: Best beard trimmer 35 bucks could buy. This should be a 4.5+ Star rated device.as you normally would. -- You do not have to oil this any more than any other trimmer, unless of course you are washing away the oil all the time.&lt;br /&gt;~ &amp;#34;Battery no last me long, only 50 minutes.

            <li> Shaves close, holds a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> I have thick facial hair and the trimmer works great! The battery life is really good and the trimmer has several different length settings. I use it in the shower and rise it directly under water and so far not problems.</li>
            <li> Fabulous trimmer, the best I have ever used and worth every penney.</li>
            <li> I got it with black friday discount and its the best beard trimmer I have ever seen . I love it !</li>
            <li> Great trimmer, especially that it clears with running water. I like all the adjustable settings.</li>
            <li> •:*¨¨*:•.♥♥BRILLIANT.•:*¨¨*:•.5 STAR •:*¨¨*:•.THANK YOU!!♥♥.•:*¨¨*:</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re in the market to look for a beard &amp; moustache trimmer, look no further.  I was fortunate enough to be able to purchase this during one of Amazon&#x27;s deal of the day and based on other reviews, I jumped in on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thick, coarse facial hair, which makes shaving/trimming very difficult.  But not with this Panasonic!!  It has a ton of settings (19), it&#x27;s easy to clean and maintain (comes with ample oil to treat blades between use) and is built very well with the consumer in mind.  Come on, you can, and I HAVE used mine in the shower!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save yourself the trouble, time, and aggravation with dealing with sub-par trimmers.  Get this one!  You&#x27;ll thank me later.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had many Panasonic beard trimmers over the years. Unfortunately, their quality steadily going down. They are cheaply made, the blades instead of cutting are ripping the hair. ER-GB40-S is no exception. The trimmer is returned.</li>
            <li> Excellent trimmer. I was using phillips norelco body groomer before thus. However that was not very powerful. I had to move it over the same area 3-4 times to trim all the hair. Panasonic has to be moved only once and all the hair get trimmed. I also love the ability to adjust so many different lengths. I prefer different lengths depending on the body part.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product. The height/depth adjustment is very precise on the blade guard. My only note would be that it is difficult to get small precise cuts/trims even with blade guard removed. It&#x27;s the best lawn mower, but not the best weed whacker. Very durable and feels good in the hand. I feel that the water proof design and rechargeable stand make this the best product facial hair product that I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Easy to use powerful great shave</li>
            <li> Had a beard down to my lower chest, and took this to it with no issues whatsoever. It sounds really underpowered, and the battery doesn&#x27;t last as long as I would prefer, but overall really solid feel, build, and I shaved off my &#x27;no shave 2014&#x27; beard no problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I kinda wish they gave you a bit longer options for trimming, but then i suppose it would be a larger trimmer which i wouldn&#x27;t want.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be more powerful.</li>
            <li> One huge flaw that kills it and renders it useless: the guide is attached in such a cheap manner that it is terrible hard to remove or attach, and breaks after a few uses. This is a real shame, because it&#x27;s an otherwise good product: wet/dry, rinsable, guide works well when working. Unfortunately, the guide is to big a part of a beard trimmer to be cheap and flimsy. A really disappointing flaw.</li>
            <li> not designed to trim a mustache.</li>
            <li> a really great trimmer. Very precise adjustments and sharp blades.</li>
            <li> Looks amazing n trims very smooth but takes hell lot of time. I always end up with unfinished trim after trimming for 10-15 mins 😡</li>
            <li> Awesome trimmer. It&#x27;s nice to have so many settings.</li>
            <li> Very nice, Glad I have it !</li>
            <li> Trims great, makes you want to grow more facial hair.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is way better than the cheap one I used for years. To think of all the time I wasted, I should have bought this long ago. Exceeds expectations.</li>
            <li> head broke after a short while of using</li>
            <li> Without the guard – i.e. for close trimming – it cuts the skin repeatedly. This makes it effectively worthless unless I own a second piece of shaving equipment as I generally need to trim some parts of my beard close and others just cut down to size.</li>
            <li> Perfect shave anytime</li>
            <li> I like the all in one guide, I like the docking station, however motor is weak. So can only use it for touchups</li>
            <li> great price and really fast delivery</li>
            <li> Lots of battery, sharp blades, easy to clean, stand looks good on the counter!</li>
            <li> works well, but my biggest complaint is that it should have a longer beard trim length</li>
            <li> Had double trouble with Item ,needed to return twice, first trimmer would not snap-in ,than charger would not charge, would not recommend this shaver</li>
            <li> undoubtably the best trimmer I have owned. I have used both wahl and philips trimmers and this timmer has given me the closest trim for my sensative skin.</li>
            <li> Works great!! Great price</li>
            <li> Wow! This thing will plow through anything.  I have moderately course facial hair and every other trimmer I&#x27;ve used bogs down when trimming the smallest stubble.  I&#x27;ve been using this trimmer for about 2 months and haven&#x27;t had a single occasion where I felt this product didn&#x27;t meet or exceed my expectations.  I&#x27;m thinking about ordering another as a backup.</li>
            <li> I bought this item. when i got it everything was great. but in a 4 days this trimmer stop working at all. so now i am looking for a new trimmer.</li>
            <li> Cuts well, but made of cheap plastic that&#x27;s very fragile.  Don&#x27;t drop it.</li>
            <li> Great all-around trimmer. I use it several times each week and get a very consistent result. Easy to use and high quality. Plus it&#x27;s water proof, can be used in the shower and cleaned with a simple rinse. At $45 it was a steal, but I would have bought it at it&#x27;s regular $70 price. I don&#x27;t buy Braun, Norelco, or Remington anymore - only Panasonic shavers &amp; trimmers.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic shaver model lived up to it&#x27;s lofty reviews, I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased, this was a flat out terrific buy as well ... !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lee L.  Naples, FL</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift and so far my husband has no complaints. Much easier to use than his last brand.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item for my husband and he absolutely loves it.  He uses it all the time but for those really close shaves you do need a razor for smooth skin!</li>
            <li> After having issues with Wahl trimmers, I decided to go with a different brand. So, I researched and found this trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;I liked the design &amp; that it was quiet. That&#x27;s about all I liked.&lt;br /&gt;The hair stuck to the handle &amp; it ripped my hair out no matter which direction I tried to shave with it.&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say it was returned &amp; I won&#x27;t be buying that brand again.</li>
            <li> So easy to set he length of my beard, and be consistent with it.</li>
            <li> This shaver is ok, the shaver doesn&#x27;t give a smooth shave so another one might need to be used to smooth shave.</li>
            <li> A great gift for the man in your life!</li>
            <li> Met expectations, very nice.</li>
            <li> Christmas gift for father.  He was pleased.</li>
            <li> After 12 months ownership the charger no longer works, so unit is useless.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m mostly bald. I buzz what&#x27;s left. Rather than wasting 20 bucks and waiting in line for an hour twice a month at a barbershop, I decided to try doing my own buzzes.  I tried a popular department store brand before I tried this, and this is much better quality even though almost the same price. This works perfectly. This has a smooth, comfortable plastic guard that does a fine job of protecting you from nicks and electric razor burns. It has a fast, powerful motor. It&#x27;s important to pop the blade off and lubricate it. I wash the blade in alcohol. No signs of rust, so it really is a stainless steel blade.</li>
            <li> The package was delivered in the time period stated.  The trimmer is much better quality than the body trimmer I had prior and I believe the attached comb prongs will not so easily brake as what happened with my Phillips trimmer.  It also has an easy to use adjustment wheel with changes every .5 mm.  The only negative is I wish you could adjust it for something bigger than 10 mm.</li>
            <li> To those who are claiming it pulls hair when you don&#x27;t use the guard... It States Clearly In The Instructions... Use lather or shaving oil or on a Wet Face when not using the guard. It is made to have a substance to make the facial hair/skin slick. No problems. Also, Oil the machine up every time you use it wet so it stays in the best operating condition possible. It takes less than 30 seconds to do this. I love it. My one thing to note... make sure you know which side is showing the Number Level for length. I wasn&#x27;t paying attention and shaved off half my bear in one stroke because I thought it was an 10 and it was at a 1. I was holding it backwards. So that is my fault for not noting it shows the numbers on both sides.</li>
            <li> A fine waterproof unit for all of your trimming needs. All it needs is a little rinse afterwards and most all of the beard trimmings are gone. Because of this the instructions do recommend oiling regularly. I try to do so once every week or two. Think of all the money on razors and shaving cream you&#x27;ll save as a result.</li>
            <li> The best trimmer and great close shave, super soft, silky smooth skin. A+++++++++ Blue Ribbon Winner</li>
            <li> Nice beard trimmer. My old Panasonic gave up and died and I had to get another one. This won is different in how it looks and works, and with some adjustment, I have found it to work well. I love Panasonic electronic items; trimmers, radios, TV&#x27;s, etc. They have all been quality products and I am very loyal to them.</li>
            <li> Great Product..  Very easy to use..</li>
            <li> Bought this trimmer to use primarily as a beard trimmer and it works great. Adjustable head allows any length you want and runs smooth and cleans easily</li>
            <li> It trims well and holds a charge very well. I&#x27;ve gone days without charging it and it still has power.</li>
            <li> My son loves it. After having to throw away too many cheaper models from Target. He&#x27;s very happy with it and says he has no complaints.</li>
            <li> I bought this for trimming my beard based on some decent reviews, after trying it a couple of times it simply is a poor product. It does not cut close at all, so trying to use it in order to line up your beard will simply not work. Also, there is a lot of tug and pull when using this. The length dial for trimming is useless, thank god I tried it on my arm first or else it would have ended in a beard shaving...</li>
            <li> The beard trimmer&#x27;s dial settings are difficult to understand at first, with the setting numbers viewable from both front and back. However, since the numbers are on a continuous wheel from low to high, it was hard to know which side to read.  I trimmed my beard far to short the first time...now I know.  Also, unlike other trimmers I&#x27;ve owned, this one only cuts as I move it upwards, against the grain. This takes some getting used to also...I&#x27;d prefer if it worked in both directions, as did my Braun.</li>
            <li> the only thing I would alter if I could would be a wider blade -- other than that -- I&#x27;ll definitely buy another when needed</li>
            <li> Bought it for my husband. He loves the fact that he can use it in the shower. Great buy!</li>
            <li> Finally found a razor that could do it all, very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Works good on my beard &amp; mustache, I&#x27;ve never run out of juice. lots of adjustment, works great</li>
            <li> Great trimmer.  Best I have used.</li>
            <li> Its a great product. Really comfortable while using.</li>
            <li> I ordered this trimmer for my husband for Christmas. This is a great trimmer for beards but no so much for hair. In his words, it shaves very smooth and doesnt vibrate much. Would reccomend this product for men who like grooming their beards.</li>
            <li> Feels solid and makes little noise&lt;br /&gt;Built in dial to adjust trimming length is much better than multiple replaceable guards&lt;br /&gt;Lasts for days on a charge&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only con I see is it doesn&#x27;t work as well with body hair as others I&#x27;ve had, but does a great job for its primary purpose</li>
            <li> This work great.  I bought it for my husband and I use it to cut his hair and he uses it to trim his beard.  I knew I couldn&#x27;t lose with a Panasonic.</li>
            <li> My husband is very pleased with trimmer. He said it was just what he wanted.</li>
            <li> Did exactly what it said it would and priced well</li>
            <li> The unit worked very well the first year. The battery almost died the second year. Panasonic Customer Service said that I would have to pay for the shipping and servicing (if the warranty has run out) and I would need to send the proof of purchase. Not happy. Now I have to buy another unit.</li>
            <li> wow perfect and really go Under water&lt;br /&gt;pay attention and read the manual :)</li>
            <li> This is the worst buzzer I have every purchased.  Blade feel off after 1 use on sideburns.  Would never buy another panasonic buzzer.</li>
            <li> Surprised at how quiet it is compared to my old Norelco trimmer.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my fiance for Christmas and he loves it! He has a full beard and uses it for that and also his chest! Great buy and price!</li>
            <li> Works well but charge doesn&#x27;t seem to hold well !!!</li>
            <li> Have used this dozens of times now and it works great for &#x27;trimming&#x27;.  Does not work well for shaving off a lot of beard or head hair- hair gets stuck in guard- but it&#x27;s not made for that.  Highly adjustable, super easy to clean, charge stays strong, easy to grip even in soapy shower.  I have seen high ratings for this product from many sources including &amp;quot;Men&#x27;s Journal&amp;quot; (best of).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  The first one I bought broke within a week- the adjustable trimmer head would not &#x27;click&#x27; into and stay on the unit.  It was replaced quickly and the second unit has been great- until today (June of 2017).  The same thing happened again.  Probably too late to get it replaced this time.  I will be trying another brand unless Panasonic will step up.</li>
            <li> This did a really good job when I first got it. However, I noticed the guard was feeling a bit chintzy. Then, what I was afraid of happening...happened. I was trying to pull off the guard to use the bare clippers to do some fine trimming and the 2 white plastic arms that hold it in place broke. There is now nothing to hold the guard in place and I don&#x27;t believe Panasonic will replace such an obscure part as the 2 plastic arms (which you would need to open the unit up to access). I now have a $40 paperweight. I decided to revert to my old Panasonic personal groomer which actually only needed minor repair to its guard (nothing like a little superglue). All in all, I wouldn&#x27;t waste your time with this product. You&#x27;ll be OK until you try to use it.</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas gift for my adult son.  He said it works great, better than his previous unit</li>
            <li> My husband is so happy with it we bought 2</li>
            <li> It is good so far. I liked it</li>
            <li> The trimmer is nice and comfortable. Fits in your hand well and has a beard trimmer it&#x27;s great. However for lining and edging the motor is not strong at all. It doesn&#x27;t cut close well. So if you want it simply for trimming it&#x27;s great otherwise no.</li>
            <li> this is AC only. No DC adapter available. That means no car charging... which is nice to have that option. Otherwise it&#x27;s a great device.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a beard for the past five years, and have struggled to find a trimmer that i didn&#x27;t have to run over my face 4-5 times to trim all the hair. I think I may have found my trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seems to trim evenly, cleans up fairly easily, and fits well in your hand. The adjustable dial for length is easy to use, although if you don&#x27;t pay attention you can change it without noticing.</li>
            <li> I was very hesitant to purchase this, but I am glad i did.  It has worked flawlessly, quiet operation, and waterproof as mentioned.  However, for those who regularly like to grow out there beard to great lengths, i would not recommend.  My beard was pretty long (much longer than 10mm), and it took a couple passes to get rid of all the stragglers.  It works great for those who like to keep their builds neat and trimmed.  It has yet to cut me (even with the guard removed), and has not pulled like my last shavers used to.  I was concerned with the range in beard height (up to 10mm), but after using it for the past month, i have found 6.5mm to be perfect for me. I have had no issues with battery life.  I just trim my beard and back on the charger it goes.  I highly recommend this unit!</li>
            <li> When I purchased this I really liked it perfect size for me. My beard was about 1.5 to 2 with a little longer goat. I recently cut it down to about 1/4&amp;#34; and I understood why a few other reviewers was saying it cut unevenly. I had patches all over (and it was not because of follicle density)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am willing to accept it may be me and not the trimmer so I will explain how I used it and if I am using it wrong please share you wisdom&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Starting at the top of one sideburn down to my jaw line I slowly trim in the direction of hair growth after the row I take a quick look to see if there is any excess build up I thought that might have ben the problem but it was not&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if anyone has any ideas let me know and I will update my review.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this trimmer and uses it all the time. It keeps a charge for a really long time!</li>
            <li> This worked great on my beard. My beard is great now. Thanks. Go beards!</li>
            <li> Very well put together totally quality. Fits well in your hand and is very quiet. I guess I just don&#x27;t like having to oil it after uses.  Take it form me you better oil it or it will loose rpm and will not cut as well. I gurss it is still old school for a good clipper. Cuts well and the guard makes it safe for cutting below the waist.</li>
            <li> The only issue is that the settings end at 10mm, which is too short for trimming my beard. Other than that a solid product.</li>
            <li> nice item and good seller nice to work with them</li>
            <li> My husband has a mustache and beard that he keeps groomed very well.  His older groomer was wearing out and I found this on Amazon.  It was exactly what he was looking for.  He loves it!</li>
            <li> Hubby loves this trimmer.</li>
            <li> Best Beard trimmer I have ever had!</li>
            <li> Works great for me.  Love the fact that you can use it in the shower.  Also the charging base is well designed.</li>
            <li> Does not charge. Never operated correctly out of the box.</li>
            <li> After using first day my charger got dead :(</li>
            <li> Background: I have owned and researched dozens of beard trimmers for use in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So after getting married I started trimming my beard in the shower to keep from getting hair all over the sink.  Happy wife / happy wife, right?  So of all the trimmers out there that claim to work in water, I would say this is by FAR the best - between the incredibly specific lengths you can adjust to and the fact that its clearly built for wet use, I&#x27;d say its 100% worth the money.  I&#x27;ll never buy another brand/model than this one.</li>
            <li> No sound, nice grip, small so you can get best results. Very precise. You can really see the difference between a 9 mm long and a 10 mm long</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband and he really loves it.  It is very quiet compared to his old one and does a great job at shaving.</li>
            <li> The Things They Don&#x27;t Tell You are...&lt;br /&gt;THIRTY hours for first charge.&lt;br /&gt;TWENTY hours for subsequent charges.&lt;br /&gt;Only 50 MINUTES, roughly, of use-time before needing a recharge.&lt;br /&gt;You must OIL at three locations BEFORE and AFTER each use.&lt;br /&gt;Power indicator gives NO CLUE as to its Charge Status.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gorgeous design. Fits well in the hand.&lt;br /&gt;Ridiculous charge times and maintenance hassles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really wanted to like this unit, but life is too short. I bought a Lithium-Ion based unit, instead -- which requires no oil or crazy charge times, and can be used while charging.</li>
            <li> work very good for trimming my tee... takes a little practice but I think they all do?</li>
            <li> No matter how long it charges it seems to run slow!</li>
            <li> Excellent beard trimmer and very reliable.  Wet/dry for safety and convenience.  LIke it a lot, or I did until I shaved my beard.</li>
            <li> i have had this product for 11 months and the charger is no longer working...</li>
            <li> Fantastic product. Doesn&#x27;t pull my hair.</li>
            <li> Excellent product ! After many others these trimmers are the bomb .</li>
            <li> Pros: quite, ergonomic shape, water-proof&lt;br /&gt;Cons: weak, underpowered motor.</li>
            <li> This trimmer cuts like no other trimmer I&#x27;ve owned. It&#x27;s quiet, and the wet/dry option is great. Some reviews say battery must charge for 24hrs before each use but... c&#x27;mon, who&#x27;s trimming multiple times a day. Most trimmers require going over the same spots multiple times, but not this one. *Update: its been two years since my purchase. The motor runs a bit slower until I put it under water. It also bites hard occasionally.*</li>
            <li> This is a well made Panasonic product that works well.  The height adjustments are great and it is a powerful little unit.  My one dislike is that the recharging light stays on constantly and you are never quite sure when the battery is completely charge.  I simply leave it on overnight and that seems to work.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste time with a vacuum enabled trimmer to catch trimmings. Just use this in the shower and you have no cleanup issues. Works really well.</li>
            <li> Trims very well, but does get warm. Have not tried it wet yet. The cordless is awesome!</li>
            <li> Use it to trim my hairline at the back of my neck. variable trimmer blade lengths are one of its best features. Easy to use, rinse, and recharge.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is can be used in the shower and is very easy to clean. Glad I didn&#x27;t go for the cheap trimmer again.</li>
            <li> I wanted a trimmer that I could use to trim my beard and shave my head with in the shower. This does the job really well.</li>
            <li> pretty good.  no real complaints  but will it last?</li>
            <li> Quiet and easy to use. Fits nicely in the hand and is very well designed. Very adjustable and cuts cleanly. Cleaning is easy with the included brush. It came charged.</li>
            <li> Comes with long lasting battery, has comfortable settings, and a close trim.&lt;br /&gt;I really enjoy this product.  Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> It needs very long time to charge fully</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very good , it&#x27;s let the man handsome . :)</li>
            <li> Love this razor. Don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t buy one years ago. I had an old battery operated Norelco for a decade, this this blows it out of the water. Use it in the shower with no issues</li>
            <li> Better than panasonic&#x27;s cheaper black-silver thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this guy to buzz my hair and my beard. It works great, no problems.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I like this trimmer and am glad I purchased it.  It is a very good trimmer. There are a couple of reasons I say it is not a great trimmer and therefore only gets 4 stars.  First, I do not feel the quality of the trim is good when removing the guard and using it to do detail cleanup along the edge of my beard.  For that, I prefer my small Gillette trimmer that operates on a AA battery.  Second, the advertisement of being able to use it in the shower is a little misleading, or at least it was to me.  You can&#x27;t use it in the shower with the guard on to do your normal trimming of your entire beard.  In order to use it in the shower, you must remove the guard which means just using it to do the cleanup work that I just mentioned as being inferior. Like a couple of other reviewers I also believe the motor could be a little more powerful too, but it cuts through my dry beard just fine, so maybe the motor is just right. On the plus side, this trimmer appears to be very solidly built and of high quality.  It feels good in my hand and is easy to hold onto and maneuver.  The charging stand works well and securely holds the trimmer.  I do wish the light that glows while charging would indicate when it has completed the charging cycle.  However, the instruction manual indicates it can not be overcharged, so maybe this is not a big deal. Hopefully the manual is right about it not overcharging. The ultimate review is that I would buy this again, so I definitely recommend this beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do the job!  Very poor at mustache trimming.  Do not recommend.</li>
            <li> The product is good, though you need to oil it after everytime u use it</li>
            <li> Loved the product, but after the first charge ran out (it lasted a long time, because I only used it about once a week to trim up my beard) it never charged again. I&#x27;ve left it plugged in for hours and the light doesn&#x27;t come on, and nothing happens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried Panasonic&#x27;s online chat, the telephone support, and the repair webpage--which will not allow me to create the required account, to try and get them to tell me how to get it repaired or replaced. And I have no useful response and no idea how to get this resolved whatsoever. I&#x27;ll never buy anything from panasonic again. Product breaks and they throw smoke and mirrors to keep me from getting any help resolving the issue.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and works well so far</li>
            <li> I had and old panasonic trimmer that finally died. This one seems a lot more durable, easy to clean, and I don&#x27;t need to replace the batteries once a month. The adjustments are great and works well dry and wet.</li>
            <li> Nicest trimmer I have ever owners.... Exceeded expectations up to this point if it doesn&#x27;t tear up and will last :)</li>
            <li> Trimmer is awesome! I&#x27;m stoked that it&#x27;s waterproof as well!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m starting with a 4 but if it lasts a few months I may come back and up it to a 5. Ten months later and I&#x27;m dropping a star. This thing bites. No, really, with the guard removed it likes to take little nips here and there and will snag and pull hair. Even on a beard that&#x27;s less than fun. Skip ahead to Sept 2016 and I&#x27;m giving it a star back. Still not a 5 star but it still works - and still bites.</li>
            <li> I love this trimmer.  Works great and trims really cleanly.  I love the adjustment options that is perfect for my needs.</li>
            <li> the 1mm setting really works for my beard.  Good power when doing heavy trimming too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for nine months.  I use it not only for my beard but for my head as well.  Cuts crisp, though with my head does require a few passes (not precisely made for that, so it&#x27;s not a complaint).  Battery lasts for quite some time (I get a few weeks out of it at least), but recharge time is pretty long (overnight).  Cleans very easily, the lowest setting is just a shade longer than what I would call stubble, and holds up under water without malfunctioning.</li>
            <li> This clipper is fantastic.  My husband loves it.  He has used it for 2 years without any issue and we just purchased another one.  Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> All I can say is that it works well, has the power to trim even the wildest beards yet has NEVER even grabbed a hair and yanked it out, especially when you&#x27;re trimming up &#x27;sensitive&#x27; areas - you know, like your neck and Adam&#x27;s apple areas.  It&#x27;s quite a bit smaller and sleeker than what I&#x27;m used to, but am so impressed with HOW it works, you get over that quickly.  Best of all, it&#x27;s quiet and doesn&#x27;t remind you of the Dentist drilling away.</li>
            <li> Works like a pro...easy to use...waterproof too!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Simple &amp; ergonomic design makes it easy to operate! A very good product for sure!</li>
            <li> Works great and feels like a solid well made device. Being able to pull the guard off and use the trimmer to trim the mustache and beard line is awesome.</li>
            <li> this trimmer is good but if it had a vacuum that collected the hairs as you trimmed them it would be the best trimmer!</li>
            <li> Love this shaver.  Panasonic products are awesome to use and to own.  This was a replacement for another model I broke and I cannot say how very pleased I am overall.</li>
            <li> Great quality and I really like the fact there are no attachments.  Adjustable trim length is nice.  Best trimmer I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> takes tooo long to charge</li>
            <li> My dad sent me the link to purchase for his birthday. He doesn&#x27;t usually remark on products but stopped me just to say how much he loved it, especially the built in levels.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy trimmer with lots of levels to choose from. Great design with a great charging stand. Couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> Works amazing...my husband loves it! The dial up length is so much better than having a box of attachments! It doesn&#x27;t tug or pull the hair when shaving either.</li>
            <li> I was afraid this would not be able to do all the cutting I need it to do but it did all that and then some on one charge! Very satisfied for the price!</li>
            <li> With years of beard experience I can honestly say this is the best trimmer I have ever owned. The locking height setting cures a pet peeve with other trimmers that can change if to much pressure is applied. The guides are short and rounded which allows you to get into tight areas, without  poking or gouging, and the cutter does not load up with trimmings like the other trimmers I have used. The large number of settings allows for any desired height. And the minimum setting works great for trimming up close to the border of ones beard. Quality of the product is good, and the handle is comfortably shaped.&lt;br /&gt;My beard is medium length and a bit curly. Those with a very long beard or one that is very thick and curly might have a different opinion, but for the rest of us I think the Panasonic ER-GB40-S would be a very good choice.</li>
            <li> This product is really great for tasks such as: Trimming hair; cutting small amounts of thin hair; trimming whiskers; making bodyparts with hair, hairless; shortening hair.</li>
            <li> Took too much off the first time but works well</li>
            <li> This product is easy to use and does a great job. The head is very easy to adjust and makes for a even cut.</li>
            <li> This is the best.  My son got one for graduation and I bought one for my husband because he liked it so well.  You can adjust it for different lengths, and it has a charger.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too weak, I need at least five minutes just to cut the bear of 3 days. I regret this purchase</li>
            <li> I use it to trim what little hair I have left</li>
            <li> not great... but then perhaps I had higher expectations. This machines blade is small and it really isn&#x27;t great... also won&#x27;t work abroad without a transformer. Charged it abroad the first time w/o noticing it and i might have ruined it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Wahl trimmers over the years because they simply were the ones that were available. I read something about this one and thought that I&#x27;d give it a try. The difference is truly amazing. a MUCH more precise instrument that simply does a better job than any Wahl trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time after I got it yesterday. I was using Phillips Norelco since 4 years now. This Panasonic machine is not bad but when I am trimming, it is sticking or holding, sometimes. It is not really a pleasure experience unlike Norelco where the length of the blade is tad longer than this one. Overall its okay but I am not satisfied. I wish Amazon takes it back from me as am unsatisfied customer. Am sorry.</li>
            <li> pulls hair when shaving to close.</li>
            <li> So far, so good!  Great for trimming a beard without having to use different gadgets, heads, etc., as is the case with my old Wahl model.  I wish it was dual voltage for travel, which it surprisingly isn&#x27;t, especially from an international company!</li>
            <li> I only shave one a week and use this on the shortest setting to trim my face and head down short enough to shave with a blade. This product does a great and comfortable job doing that. I also use it to trim my goatee - it excels at that as well. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> great product for cutting unwanted hair. Head or body; doesn&#x27;t matter.  Easy and adjustable; no need for separate cutting clips</li>
            <li> I have a Remington trimmer for 18 years now. Never oiled it, Never needed another battery, never pulled my hair. It actually still works. This piece of crap pulls my hair. I read a lot of the reviews on this and all these men must be shaving peach fuzz. I&#x27;m back to my 18 year old beard trimmer. I guess the old sayings right. If it ain&#x27;t broke , don&#x27;t fix it.</li>
            <li> Gave as as Christmas gift.</li>
            <li> Went through a number of Walmart &amp;#34;cheapies&amp;#34;. Glad I found this one. Use it occasionally in the shower and oil it every 4-5 shaves. Seems to hold an edge well after extended use.</li>
            <li> Precise and convenient</li>
            <li> Very well made, easy to use. Love the dial, you don&#x27;t need a bunch of attachments. Thoroughly happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> It was actually better than I thought based on the performance. What I don&#x27;t like about this product is that the user can not recharge it while shaving.</li>
            <li> 100x better than the wahl lithium I have been using. It cuts so much more effectively and gets 95% of the hair in one pass.  Hard to believe I&#x27;ve had this for 1 1/2 years! It still works like new and is my go to travel clippers. If/when it dies I will replace it with the identical item if possible. How many clippers can you take in the shower and use on a daily basis that last like this? Not many! And not at this price!</li>
            <li> Product performs as dtated</li>
            <li> Panasonic always is very good and comfortable</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what to say about this. I bought this item on Aug.3 and recieved it on Aug.10. I read the instructions and plugged it in as per the instructions. Now the instructions say it will take 15 to 20 hours to charge up completely. Which at that point, the red light in front goes out and you are supposed to unplug the power cord from the wall. Well here I am, a week and a day after plugging it in and its still charging (red light is still on). So I finally called Panasonic as per their pamphlet instructions (Quote: Before returning to the seller, contact Panasonic first). Well, to make a long story short, even though I have had this trimmer for less than two weeks and have never used it. . . Panasonic basicly told me Its not their problem and that I should contact Amazon and return it to them. They told me they would &amp;#34;only honor the warranty if I bought it from them directly&amp;#34;. Not through Amazon, Target, Walmart, etc. From them &amp;#34;Directly&amp;#34;. So to that I am returning it back to Amazon and saying F**K YOU to all Panasonic products for good. I suggest you all do the same.  (All this has taken place between August 03, 2015 to August 18, 2015)</li>
            <li> Well this is my first adventure into a shaver that actually allows you to keep your  beard.  So I compared this to my Braun electric razor.  The motor on the Braun is just much more powerful.  The Panasonic looks good, but does not live up to  its looks.  And why do we have to oil it every time we use it?  That is certainly an annoyance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well I am really trying to like this razor; it will do the job, but I use this in conjunction with my Braun</li>
            <li> Nice shave and a multitude of length options.</li>
            <li> Really doesn&#x27;t trim hair all the well. Used it on my legs and got zip for my trouble....probably why it was so inexpensive.</li>
            <li> An all around great trimmer. Very powerful and reliable. More than met all of my expectations and I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> THe trimmer works great! I am very pleased with it. I just wish the blade with was wider. All in all a quality product.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research on trimmers as I buzz my head and have a closely trimmed goatee.  Chose this and am very happy with it. Very easy to use on my head to keep my hair trim (think peach fuzz), and keeping my goatee looking nice.  Easy to clean and durable.  I used to have a forfex which was recommended by a professional hair stylist, and although the motor and blades were top notch, the attachments were cheap, brittle plastic from china and kept breaking.  The Panasonic has a great design, easy to adjust the blades while never removing the attachment, but even removing it is easy.  Very satisfied with my purchase!</li>
            <li> Have used several body trimmers over the years but this one is the best of the bunch. It is obviously well built.  Most other body trimmers come with schlocky snap on plastic caps to adjust the closeness of the trim.  Those usually don&#x27;t work well and are easy to lose over time.  This Panasonic trimmer has a built-in adjustment and it works wonderfully.  I have had this trimmer only a couple of months so its longivity is unknown at this time.  However, we have had great service from Panasonic products in the past so  I expect it to have long life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have retired my Norelco, not because it no longer works but because this Panasonci is a superior product.</li>
            <li> It does not create an uniform stubble. It leaves uneven surface. bad irritation to the face.  Will not recommend. I don&#x27;t use this product.</li>
            <li> I have tried several different beard trimmers before the Panasonic and regardless of all height adjustment on this unit, I was not satisfied of the closeness of the cut.</li>
            <li> Fantastic shave; quiet, precise and very well made.  I highly recommend this item!!</li>
            <li> Great product that lasts!  I have had this over 13 months now and it still functions perfectly.  I have been trimming my beard 2-3 times a week with this trimmer and it works like day one.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I bought this Panasonic trimmer recently and I regret buying it.  The trimmer seems to be made well and functions well, but the head is a little too wide and bulky to give me an even trim over all parts of my beard.  It&#x27;s width keeps it from getting into uneven parts of my face.  I keep my beard trimmed close to my face.  The depth adjustment is clever, but doesn&#x27;t cut as evenly as the Wahl, which has several guides to attach separately. The Panasonic does a great job with sideburns.  Before the Panasonic, I had a Wahl 9918-6171 Groomsman Beard and Mustache Trimmer for several years that I liked, but thought that I would get something with a little more power when the battery finally failed and I was forced to replace it.  Not that the power on the Wahl was not sufficient, I just wanted to try something different.  The Wahl&#x27;s battery lasted for several years and the value is great, given that the Wahl is just $15.  I made a mistake with the Panasonic and am ordering a new Wahl Groomsman.</li>
            <li> This is a nice trimmer, so far I really like it. Easy to hold and trims great. Sharp blades cut hair the first time, no need to keep going over an area again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great, easy to wash off after a nice clean shave. However I sometimes like my beard to be a little longer then the shaver allows, if Panasonic just made and attachment to switch out with the one it came with, I would buy it and rate this 5 stars.  I have searched but have not had any luck.</li>
            <li> Pretty inconsistent machine. Leaves uneven patches all over the place. I&#x27;ve used it 3 times now and each time I have had to completely buzz off my beard since this machine did such a bad job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only reason I give it two stars is because of the battery life. I&#x27;d look at other options</li>
            <li> Really good all around hair trimmer.</li>
            <li> Tends to grab once in a while, but it does make beard trims easy.</li>
            <li> Great for keeping everything even but it doesn&#x27;t line very well at all</li>
            <li> Pretty disgusted and amazed. Box looked a little ruffed up. Just looked at it again and I assume there use to be a clear plastic sticker or something on the bottom seal (all I can see is the mark of where it use to be) didn&#x27;t really notice anything off until I started looking at the dial where you can turn for a different length. And in between the guard I can see small hair trimmings (Alrighty...  Thats cool). Turned the dial to the longest adjustment and found a nice bit of hair. Fairly disgusting. If it was a friends trimmer, cool, but one that I expected to be brand new (unused) is pretty nasty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 star for quality control through entire assembly to distribution to consumer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 stars for the guy who shaved whatever part of his body with it. And his ability to put it back in the original packaging without having the courtesy to at least clean it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 stars for the fact that I am probably the only people for being graced with a gently used trimmer. I feel pretty special.</li>
            <li> I trust Panasonic as usual. This item didnt disappoint me. :)</li>
            <li> Easy to use and has multiple adjustment settings (1 to 10 w/.5 incr.) to choose from. The best cordless trimmer I have had.</li>
            <li> After my last trimmer died, did some research and saw this one at a store for 70 bucks, got it here cheaper and haven&#x27;t had any problems with this product.</li>
            <li> I wish the settings went a little higher so I could rock a thicker beard. The clipper guard itself seems to be precariously connected to the system and pulling it out to clean it almost feels like you are going to break it.</li>
            <li> These trimmers are well constructed, works wet or dry and provides very precise grooming. I ordered a second pair for my brother and we both love it.</li>
            <li> Works great.  Only thing it&#x27;s missing is a battery level indicator.  I dislike devices that do not allow me to monitor overcharging status.</li>
            <li> To trim a beard this is a necessity! Great price and does a really good job trimming my beard.</li>
            <li> good buy, got for c-day and my bf loved it.  so happy i choose this one, he loves being clean shaven.</li>
            <li> Love it ! Works great ... Looks great ... Happy with purchase</li>
            <li> Great design and performance!! I made a good choice! Highly recommended! This trimmer has a great feel to it and has lots of adjustments!</li>
            <li> The micro adjustment on the height of the cut is especially well done and easy to fine tune. I&#x27;d buy again.</li>
            <li> The shaver itself is perfect, but it only came with a full cradle for charging which is not very convenient for travelling</li>
            <li> I love it for a quick trim of the beard. Saves a lot of time compared to using a comb and scissors.</li>
            <li> I have tried several electric shavers, and this is by far the best!  The length adjustment is great, and the head pulls off easily for close shave and to clean.  Plenty of power and battery life for my use!</li>
            <li> Feels cheap. If you use without the guard, you get pinched a lot.</li>
            <li> best trimmer i&#x27;ve owned to date for the price</li>
            <li> WOW powerful tool my Hubby loves it, all over body shave in just minutes</li>
            <li> Trims well bit you have to give the same area MANY MANY PASSES to cut all the hair.  Next time going back to Norelco QT series.</li>
            <li> I have used several beard trimmers over the years and this is easily the worst. I have to run it over an area 5 times for it to trim all the hair. Truly a terrible razor. dont but it.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband for Christmas and he loves it.  Reported that it works great without any tugging or pulling of the skin.  Glides easily and easy to use.  Works great wet or dry.</li>
            <li> Still running on a single charge!  Bought in September 2014 and it&#x27;s now Mar 30, 2014.  Easy to use and a nice grip.</li>
            <li> Best trimmer I have bought. Really fast shipping</li>
            <li> Hubby loves it and very versatile.</li>
            <li> This trimmer stopped working after 3 months of use. The red light battery indicator is no longer on. I don&#x27;t know what to do? Hope I could a replacement or my money back!</li>
            <li> great clipper.  Best I&#x27;ve owned.  Very easy to use, easy to clean, cuts great.  I especially love that I don&#x27;t have to change guards in order to change the length, all I have to do is turn a dial.</li>
            <li> PRO&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;- Stainless blades, just rinse off in the water, no rust&lt;br /&gt;- Rechargeable, no cords&lt;br /&gt;- Handy stand, always ready&lt;br /&gt;- Precise adjustable cutting settings&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CON&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;- A little pricey&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have owned this trimmer for months now and it is definitely the best one I have ever owned.  If it lasts as long as I hope it does, then the price should be a non-issue.</li>
            <li> So far I have used this trimmer for 2 months and am impressed.  The trimmer is easy to adjust and leaves a even finish.  The only downside about this product is the long charge time (first time charge is 36 hours).</li>
            <li> Requires a few repetition to get a good shave. Other than that is great.</li>
            <li> This is a good trimmer.  I&#x27;m still getting used to it but it cuts well and is relatively quiet.  Something about it doesn&#x27;t seem quite right.  I think if the head was turned 180 degrees (facing the power button), it would feel better (silly complaint, I know).</li>
            <li> Awsome experince,great product,light weight,easy to handle and maintain.&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is it dosent come with a case.&lt;br /&gt;Happy customer</li>
            <li> trims very well and very good control on the length (prevent from making holes if not at the right angle)</li>
            <li> Works great. No complaints.</li>
            <li> Everything about the product is great except the Battery life. I can only use it one time and then it needs to be recharged, I wish it had acted up during the first 30 days, for sure I would have sent it back.</li>
            <li> Great transaction and value.</li>
            <li> thanks for good quality</li>
            <li> So far the shaver is holding up well, but it is very difficult to get an even shave on your face.  The head design does not respond well to the curves of my face and neck.  It struggles to effectively trim the hair below my nose on my mustache.  I will likely be purchasing another shaver for my beard in the near future.  I have 5 o&#x27;clock shadow and it doens&#x27;t work very well for my short haired beard.</li>
            <li> Does a real good job on my face and my son thinks it is good too. Hope it will last many years!</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver for my 25 year old son for Christmas. He is quite impressed with it. Having multiple settings is a great advantage for this product.</li>
            <li> I love it. Been through so many similar types of trimmers and this thing is just designed well. Don&#x27;t have to bother with different plastic heads and it&#x27;s so much easier to clean with the way water can flow through it. Get this it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I researched and read all kinds of reviews on trimmers and this one seemed to get great reviews...my husband is very pleased with all the different settings he can trim his beard with. Works great haven&#x27;t had any problems...very pleased</li>
            <li> I read the reviews on many trimmers. Each one had pros and cons.  I chose this one and have enjoyed the variety of settings, it is quiet and cleans easily.  I am pleased</li>
            <li> Christmas present for my boyfriend. He wanted a very nice quality trimmer. He was very pleased. Works perfectly. Thank you</li>
            <li> Excellent Product!!!!!</li>
            <li> Never in my history of doing business with Amazon have I experienced so many notifications of an item being purchased and shipped only to find the next day the order has been declined and not shipped.  I have never received a complete explanation for this yo yo series of transactions.  But I must say, I&#x27;m finished trying to fix this, especially for something as simple as a beard trimmer.  I think it will take a full explanation of why the cancelations before I consider ordering anything from Amazon again.  It has been a major headache.  If this notice does by chance reach someone who can give me some kind of explanation for this on again, off again way of doing business a response would be appreciated.  But frankly, I have no more energy to put into explaining my situation further.  You have the sales and cancelation history, so if you choose to look into it, okay, if not then I&#x27;m going else where to do business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Robert Gutleben</li>
            <li> does good for short hair&lt;br /&gt;But not for long hair.&lt;br /&gt;Does great for beard.&lt;br /&gt;wireless and shower &#x3D; lovely</li>
            <li> Works very well and has a good battery life</li>
            <li> Nòclips automatic razor height nothing to break..ts and charges and lasts long to trim everything and is the best razo arpund that works</li>
            <li> My son-in-law recently grew a beard, of which I did not know  about as they live in N.C., and when we gave him this trimmer there was laughter abound.  Seems there had been some conversation about the need to neaten up that beard and now there is no excuse.</li>
            <li> This is a great shaver for a great price. Washes easily and holds a charge. Smooth cut. I would recommend.</li>
            <li> Never worked correctly. Not enough power to shave or trim. Pulled hairs but didn&#x27;t cut.</li>
            <li> Great product! Easy to clean and keep maintained.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a couple months and I really enjoy using this shaver. It does great precision beard trimming and stubble. The dial makes it easy. It&#x27;s great that I can use it in the shower. Feels solid.</li>
            <li> I loved the product and it solves my purpose. I use it primarily for removing body hair and found it to be pretty efficient.</li>
            <li> Very Well-made and very useful on all kinds of  trimming, especially beards and mustaches! It is completely waterproof so you can do this in the shower, rinse it under your faucet in your sink etc. i&#x27;m very happy with this product</li>
            <li> This trimmer works great.  As advertised.  No complaints.  This is one of the best ones I&#x27;ve used over the years.</li>
            <li> So far I have not found anything bad about how the unit works. It is quiet, solidly built and runs very smoothly. The only issue I have is with the weird design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is what I mean:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.- The handle is ergonomically shaped, but the On/Off button is installed on the back side, meaning the part that fits in your palm. There is no access to it with your thumb or fingers.&lt;br /&gt;2.- The dial use to determine the length of the hair follicles (you can cut as low as 1mm for the rugged look) gets set from the back of the unit.... Yeah, what the heck was wrong with these guys? Why do I have to turn the machine facing away from me just to dial or check the setting?&lt;br /&gt;3.- The charging cradle only accepts the unit if you install it facing backwards, meaning, away from you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than everything being set back-side-forward, there is nothing wrong with the performance with the unit. This wacko design is the only reason for which they are not getting the full 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a well built, smooth running machine, go buy one right away; the strange design will either grow on you, or you will not care about it after you see how well the machine runs.</li>
            <li> Great for keeping a tidy stubble.  A little weak on power, but gets the job done otherwise.  Also good for manscaping for those who care.</li>
            <li> Perfect for use in the shower!</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s nice about this is that there are so many settings. My husband liked it. It doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space and it&#x27;s pretty user-friendly.</li>
            <li> Great product...makes it very simple to operate...no guessing....Can&#x27;t make a mistake with the easy dial</li>
            <li> nothing for travellers, has no 240 V charging!</li>
            <li> love it kids use it to trim there hair also</li>
            <li> I have been searching for the sharpest clipper for a long time and finally found it Panasonic ER-GB40-S</li>
            <li> Powerful trimmer. Takes 1 pass to trim even thick beards. Cuts close to the skin with no beard attachment, but is very finely adjustable with it.</li>
            <li> Works well with quite a few adjustments that meet my needs.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Not really what I expected.  The height adjustment for the &amp;#34;beard&amp;#34; does not work for my beard.  It leaves patches on my face.  When you take of the guide and use just the blade, it sometimes pulls.  It seems as though the motor just doesn&#x27;t have enough HP.&lt;br /&gt;Its nice you can clean it up with water, but would not buy another.</li>
            <li> Update 11/2016 - While it worked, I liked this trimmer.  This trimmer worked well for about 2 1/2 years.  After that, it just pulls and doesn&#x27;t cut.  I would think the lifespan should be longer than 2.5 years.  I have a Wahl hair cutting system and it&#x27;s 15 years and still going.  I&#x27;ll try a different model (not panasonic) with my next purchase.</li>
            <li> Requires a decent bit of maintenance and attention, and makes some odd noises when it&#x27;s not happy with the way you&#x27;re using it. Just take care of it by following the directions specified by the manufacturer, and it should be a good device. It shaves decently, but I didn&#x27;t expect much to begin with.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and my father loves it!  Easy to clean and stores nicely. Would buy another one if needed.</li>
            <li> This trimmer works great. I get a more consistent trim on my beard, works get on body hair as well.</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd one I purchased. I fried the charger overseas and the price for a new shaver and charger was about the same as a new charger. The shaver lasted for 4 full trims without charging. It is a nice produce. My son also has one and is very happy with it. No down side. Jim</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a beard trimmer that hurts so much, haha.  You must oil this thing constantly...  I&#x27;m going to be looking for a new trimmer.</li>
            <li> Relatively quiet, easily adjusted, works perfectly.  Typical Panasonic quality shaving device.  This is my fourth Panasonic shaver, and I love all of them....</li>
            <li> I love the way it works and how easy it is to break down and clean under the faucet&lt;br /&gt;only drawback is that it&#x27;s not quite powerful enough...I use it to trim sides and top of&lt;br /&gt;my head before shaving in shower and it takes longer than it should because the rpms&lt;br /&gt;aren&#x27;t quite as high as other models.  Have to go over the same spot twice to get the&lt;br /&gt;trim close enough.  Still I do like it....very light weight and stays charged for several uses&lt;br /&gt;before having to set in charge cradle.</li>
            <li> The vibration  gives a pleasing tickle when shaving your pubes but I marked it down because, try as I might, I can&#x27;t get it to fit in my ear hole.</li>
            <li> I was lookng for an inexpensive trimmer but saw this at a great price.  Instead of additional attachments this trimmer is all in one. The length of the trim can be adjusted in the unit itself.  The trimmer is well made and feels good.  Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Charger died after I took it overseas. The trimmer is too expensive for the charger to stop working in less than a year. I will not be buying another Panasonic trimmer.</li>
            <li> Love it does a great job !!</li>
            <li> This is much better than my Norelco whose plastic groves broke after a few months of use.</li>
            <li> I am quite happy with this trimmer. It has a good trimmer-guard which delivers evenly-cut facial hair. Need a few more words.</li>
            <li> gets the job done but hubby prefers razors. Better luck next year I guess! I wish he would use this, he is hot with scruff!</li>
            <li> The recommended oil (included) makes it very hard to get all the hair out but otherwise it works well. I picked this trimmer because of the way the comb is adjustable (dial vs. slide) because I didn&#x27;t want it to slip while in use and it appears that this dial mechanism will continue to work properly for a long time. The comb felt a little flimsy in my hand but holds up well when in use. I was able to extend it to 5mm and still get into the areas that I wanted to trim without any unexpected effort.</li>
            <li> Best beard trimmer I&#x27;ve found. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Have purchased many beard trimmers in the past.  Had problems with each one.  So far this is the best trimmer I have purchased.  Love that you can leave trimmer on recharger and not have to worry about it only being plugged in for 90 minutes or it will ruin trimmer.  Love that you can use this in shower and can rinse it off!  Excellent trimmer and reasonable cost!  Get it!!</li>
            <li> It does just what it says it wil do. Outstanding device. It cuts face and body hair with no pulling an dthe clean up is very easy.</li>
            <li> I know some people have a complaint about this machine but as a man who is VERY picky about keeping his beard short and blended, I love it. I thought that I did not want to go above 3 MM&#x27;s , but luckily I tried it at 3 MM&#x27;s just to try it and it is the perfect length for me. So I did not have to go crazy looking for a shorter length. It stays nice and short while still having it look like 5 o&#x27;clock shadow. I then just throw it up a half MM to blend it in with the sideburns and it is perfect. Very happy I picked this machine up.</li>
            <li> This product would be great if you did not have to oil it inside and out every time you use it, wash it, pick it up!  Who makes a wet/dry shaver that requires that much oiling?  No Panasonic shaver that I have ever seen before.  I am really disappointed in this product because of the amount of upkeep &amp; maintenance that it requires to keep it functioning.  Other than that it works very well.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t perform as well as my old trimmer.  it tends to grab my hairs instead of cut them when trimming a bottom line for my beard on my neck.  very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Works very well and love the adjustable head unit. Simple twist and done.</li>
            <li> Excellent product!!  Totally worth the money.  Panasonic cordless/rechargeable devices last forever!!!&lt;br /&gt;Just setting it in the charger is a must for lazy people like myself</li>
            <li> I pulls alot without the guide on but works well. My only real complaint is that even on the highest setting it trims too short.</li>
            <li> A great trimmer. I bought this model to replace my last Panasonic product that went to trimmer heaven. But why one star? Because the charge unit supplied is not suitable for our Australian electric current (220-240 Volts) and only has a input of 110-120 Volts. So why do you allow this item to be sold to Australia when rightfully, you block other products from being allowed to be sold to me? Considering most electric razors and trimmers adapt to various currents around the world this is indeed a strange situation to find myself in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have to say though, the trimmer arrived pre charged and held that charge for a mighty long time...so long in fact that by the time I discovered the charger dilemma the time frame in which I could return the product had expired. :(</li>
            <li> Less than a year in and the engine is making noises, as if the battery is dying or just some how is loosing power. It does it after sometimes only 30 seconds and other times after a minute or so. If I had a full thick beard I&#x27;d have no doubt that when it seems to drop in power it would struggle more to give a quick and clean cut.</li>
            <li> I use that for a hair cut and found it is too narrow and result not smooth hair cut. It also will adjust the cutting length automatically.  Cutting power are also weak .. I stop using it after a couple of times</li>
            <li> Good so far.  Haven&#x27;t had it very long.  It trims well with the comb removed.  I like being able to rinse it under the faucet.  We&#x27;ll see how long the battery stands up to charge/discharge cycles.  That&#x27;s always been the downfall of this type of trimmer for me.</li>
            <li> Very good quality.  Gives precision trim on your beard.  Very solidly constructed and easy to clean.  Only had it for about a months, but so far no issues.</li>
            <li> great clippers,  ultra sharp, and the adjustable length settings are a neat feature that makes your trimming really easy and even</li>
            <li> Performs as advertised.  Appears to be good quality.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product that I highly recommend.  Blows everything else out of the water. I use it for my face and for my hair and it does great.</li>
            <li> great trimmer very well made&lt;br /&gt;versatile with good adjustable setting and got a for a really good price</li>
            <li> as expected, good value</li>
            <li> Good beard and moustache trimmer. Huge leap in quality from the $20 trimmers. No complaints. Battery life is also good. Reccomend</li>
            <li> It does its job.  Its cool to use wet however when trimming wet long hair, some hair is missed.  Best to use dry.</li>
            <li> Love it. Shave in the shower, avoid making a mess around your sink! &amp;#34;Click&amp;#34; adjustable comb up to 10mm.&lt;br /&gt;It does need to be cleaned and oiled after every wet use.&lt;br /&gt; $10 cheaper than at walmart!</li>
            <li> I bought this to repalce a 10 year old Norelco trimmer and it is truly awesome. It cuts through the hair without jamming. Cleaning is simple just rinse it with water. And it cuts without the annoying tugging and pulling of other shavers.  Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> really weak machine ..shaving surface is really narrow  was not impressed . would not recommend other to buy it .</li>
            <li> I bought these as I wanted to maintain a two-three day stubble beard. These Panasonics are a very easy to use trimmer. You can easily change the length (I always use the shortest length) and they are completely water resistant. Battery life is good. Like most Panasonic products it came with a range of care goods. A small brush, oil for the blades, cleaning instructions. Very hardcore users will take their blade maintenance seriously, I don&#x27;t but it&#x27;s a very nice touch. The price point is high; I&#x27;m no mustache expert but I imagine you can find comparable trimmers as a lower price. That said, these are extremely well made and sturdy (no jiggling parts) and I expect them to last for the next few years.</li>
            <li> Excellent beard trimmer exactly what you expect</li>
            <li> Does exactly what I want it for.  I don&#x27;t have a beard but a mustache and eyebrows that need trimming.  Just dial the setting and the guard  moves up or down.  The first time I used it I just set it high and worked my way to the setting that worked for me.  You can remove the guard and do precise trimming around your mouth and sideburns.  It is light weight and feels very sturdy.  Also comes with a nice charging stand.</li>
            <li> It seems like it&#x27;s underpowered and pulls the hairs on my neck. Also, there is no indicator of how full the battery is or even if it&#x27;s fully charged. Was pretty let down to be honest.</li>
            <li> Best beard trimmer I&#x27;ve owned,  especially nice to be able to groom beard in the shower. Makes clean up a breeze.  That said, wish they&#x27;d go to a lithium ion battery and dump the nickel hydroxide for a longer/faster charge, less weight, and longer battery life.  This is my second one of these.</li>
            <li> Works Great, Holds Charge for a long time</li>
            <li> The reciprocating blade doesn&#x27;t align with the fixed cutter head. This is not adjustable, so the trimmer cuts poorly. The design is awesome, but poorly executed.</li>
            <li> ok this thing i love. it is water resistant, does just what it says it does. and ofcourse i can trim my beard the size i want, i have been using this thing and only this for 6 months now and it works perfectly</li>
            <li> I bought this from the Future Shop in Calgary on sale! It works pretty well, takes a few minutes and a few passes and does a nice job. No complaints, it works as I thought it would. Use it a couple of times a week.</li>
            <li> My old Phillips 20 dollar model was finally on its last legs, so I decided to upgrade to a better model.  After doing a lot of research I saw this one to be highly recommended.  However, once I got it, I almost immediately regretted the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;The cut is consistently uneven, with my chin being cut very short but my cheeks left long.&lt;br /&gt;Its not very powerful, so I have to go over the same spots over and over again.  This leads to skin irritation.&lt;br /&gt;As for the ability to be used wet, I suppose that&#x27;s technically true, but the weak power makes cutting slick hair almost impossible.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the blades themselves get clogged with hair incredibly easily. I found my self popping off the blades at least twice per trimming session to rinse all of the hair out.&lt;br /&gt;When the hair doesn&#x27;t get clogged in the blades, it flies everywhere else.&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, the instructions advise you to oil it before and after each usage,which makes me wonder about it&#x27;s longevity.&lt;br /&gt;At this point, I&#x27;ve gone back to my falling apart Phillips, which is still able to cut better then this thing.  Definitely do not buy.</li>
            <li> I had the older version of this for years.  It eventually fell spat. I retuned this because the construction was too flimsy.</li>
            <li> This works in the shower.  That is great, but it does not give an even cut, so who cares that it works in the shower.  It gives an awful cut and is worthless.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is excellent for not only your face, but manscaping as well!  Very pleased and so is my honey!</li>
            <li> So glad I bought this. Best electric razor yet. Owned it for 8 mos and it still works greatly.</li>
            <li> This trimmer works as advertised. I&#x27;m very pleased with it. The battery stays charged for a long time and the adjustability of the trimmer can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> Another quality product from Panasonic.</li>
            <li> After reading several reviews on this shaver, I decided to purchase it. Right out of the box, the shaver was damaged and had to be returned for a replacement. This shaver does have several shaving levels which is nice, especially for beard/sideburn trimming. I find that it&#x27;s hard to get an even, clean shave though simply because of the way the detachable head is made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are instructions on how to oil the mechanism, but I find the instructions unclear, especially in regard to removing the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the product is also labeled as a &amp;#34;body&amp;#34; trimmer, it is really too small for that, and as mentioned above, it is difficult to get an even shave.</li>
            <li> I owned previous Panasonic trimmer for five years, finally it broke in air travel... So I brought this one ... this one is sleek, it has lot of settings at 0.5 mm length interval. I wish it comes with hard carrying case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before buying this I searched lot of trimmers online, Target, Walmart...etc...Believe me if you don&#x27;t want to take chance, this is the only one.&lt;br /&gt;I Strongly recommend.</li>
            <li> Great item, fast shipping thank you</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband for Christmas, he loves it, only thing he wished it had was a nose trimmer. Otherwise, very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I am still undecided on whether to return it,  I just doesn&#x27;t seem to have the power, it always sounds like it needs to be charged, like the battery is going dead, it continues to work but the sound makes me feel uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Best cordless shaver I&#x27;ve bought in awhile and has lasted long time without charging that&#x27;s a major plus</li>
            <li> I bought a cheap trimmer in a drugstore before, and it gave me nothing but disappointments. I never got my beard to look even, and when I wasn&#x27;t careful enough I ended up with an uneven cut. Well, no longer. This Panasonic trimmer lives to my expectations. The fact that it works on rechargeable batteries makes it a lot easier to use, even in the shower. There is no need to change clippers anymore, just adjust the dial to the length you wish to trim your hair or beard and let the trimmer do the rest for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are into manly products and like keeping your hair or beard in neat condition, then this product is a must!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a beard/mustache for 30+ years. My beard hairs are thick and wiry. It&#x27;s the reason I have a beard in the first place--too painful to shave.  Lots of trimmers have come and gone in three decades. Usually they don&#x27;t impress me as good or bad--just a tool. Not so, this trimmer. It really is a one pass trim. I thought the random long strand after a trim was normal. I suppose it is when you&#x27;re using another trimmer.</li>
            <li> i had so much fun with this i now look like an albino... i am totally hair free....!!! I probably should have stopped at my beard.... actually i have tried many different razor shavers etc... and this one is the best so far.... I would definitely recommend...if you have questions on specifics shoot me a email... top notch</li>
            <li> Charges up quickly and trims easily.  The settings are clearly marked.  Runs a long time on a single charge.  No real issues with it.</li>
            <li> I have trimmed my goatee a dozen times with this and it&#x27;s not required a charge yet. There is one thing I don&#x27;t like about it. The angle of the cutter is such that you have to hold it more parallel to your face to get a short cut. I used to be able to hold my old trimmer away from my face and still cut which allowed for a better view while trimming. I cut with the grain, not against, so holding it with the flat part of the comb against my face is awkward.</li>
            <li> Ive tried a few body shavers.  The quality in this one is the best.  Not gonna get that close shave but if you are looking for a specific lenth this is your shaver.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is it doesn&#x27;t let you know when its fully charged.  Light is just always on and same color when charging.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s solidly-bult, looks great, and has a nice feel to it when held.  I like its charging solution, as it prevents a wet device from shorting out.  It&#x27;s a very well-engineered product that&#x27;s very very easy to maintain and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It cuts quite well (it does pull sometimes, but not very often.. just oil up the thing when it does it).</li>
            <li> Works well. Love that it is waterproof. Consistent performance. Wiah the cutting blades were sharper and faster without the guard for nose and ear hair trimming. Best value.</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer after my old Norelco quit because of the reviews and the ability to clean it under the faucet.  The trimmer cuts my goatee fine, but requires more maintenance than any other razor I have had.  Since I used it about once a week, it&#x27;s more work than I want in a beard trimmer.  I am going to buy a new Norelco and make trimming my beard easier and less work.</li>
            <li> With more power, would be great. Other wise very nice adjustment feature. Need Tim the tool man to work on the horsepower!</li>
            <li> Works smoothly. Can hold it perfectly in your hand while you use it. Does the job perfectly. My husband loves it already.</li>
            <li> when attempting to shave with this razor it felt as if i were plucking hear from my face. Got a peanut razor - I was skeptical, but it works way better (its plug in mind you)</li>
            <li> Had a Remington before and it worked well but the battery kept going dead (poor batteries and awful charging system)  when I switched to the Panasonic I found that it worked better and had decent batteries and charging system..&lt;br /&gt;It does a great job trimming my beard. I highly recomend</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had facial hair in a long time. This does a nice job keeping it trim.  Good for general manscaping</li>
            <li> Its a trimmer, what can be said about that? It works as well as my other 10 cheapo trimmer, but not better than it.</li>
            <li> The product is good, the customer support is the worst. Had a broken trimmer head blade after a couple weeks of use. Instead of sending me the $5 trimmer head blade, they want me to send the entire body and blade assembly back to Texas and the product is not even 30 days old. This is going back to Amazon. I will stick with Norelco or Wahl.</li>
            <li> This did not have much power and did not do the job.  I am an esthetician so I need something that can work quickly, effectively and efficiently.  This was a lot of bulk and not worthy of other trimmers out there.  I chose the Phillips brand over this one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s under-powered and doesn&#x27;t even live up to the trimmer (brand) I was hoping to replace, forever.</li>
            <li> Works great.  Love that it has a dock.  And the removable guard.  Can use it for the the face and head.  Love it</li>
            <li> Simple to operate and easy to clean. The setting-adjustment dial is precise and an excellent feature.  It&#x27;s not very good for lining, but overall I like it.  I recommend it for those who want a quick, easy trim.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super happy with the performance of this trimmer. Plenty of length settings and has a good battery life. Zero complaints with this trimmer, keeps my facial hair (goatee) trimmed just right. I tried two other options before this Panasonic, this is by far the best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Works great as my facial hair trimmer, I use it to maintain my goatee. However it snags and hurts quite a bit if I try to use it without the guard to trim my stubble, so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for that. Otherwise a great trimmer, solid build and has survived quite a few falls and heavy use.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised. Worth the cost, and then some. I wear a beard and trimming is no problem. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because I thought it came with 2 additional attachments. Maybe I read the details incorrectly but I thought it said three attachments were included?</li>
            <li> Lightweight, holds charge for a while, fabulous in the shower or sink, and the height adjustability is very useful.  I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> Works great has plenty of sizes to choose from and looks good. Highly recommended. Care is easy and the charger is even easier. Buy this product and you won&#x27;t be disappointed</li>
            <li> I like how this trimmer is designed. I is hand and it has a quiet sound when it works, and the. The only thing I dislike about it, which is not really much, is its proprietary charger.</li>
            <li> My Amazon account says I have been a customer since 2005. I believe this is the first time I have ever written a product review. Let me say that I currently own a Panasonic plasma TV and have enjoyed many Panasonic products over the years. This trimmer is not one of them. There is very little power or cutting ability with this model. The battery requires 18 hours for complete charge. This provides about 30 minutes of very mediocre shave time. The design is excellent. The dial to adjust the closeness of trim is great, as is the overall ergonomics. I have never tried to use this trimmer while wet because it barely cuts dry hair. I had really hoped this product would perform as well as other Panasonic products I have owned, but was sadly disappointed. Save your money.</li>
            <li> Does a great job at cutting hair on head and on neck.  nice and smooth. would buy again if needed to.</li>
            <li> It works great. I thought it would be bigger from the picture but that&#x27;s alright. Holds a decent charge. Bababooey.</li>
            <li> Cuts a little shorter than he wants</li>
            <li> I love this trimmer! Can buzz my head in the shower and not worry about hair in the sink. Many settings for beard and hair length. My beard is outgrowing them but they work good for trimming and sculpting also.</li>
            <li> Really great piece of equipment and the price was perfect.  I like the charging station and the many adjustments available.  I bought this as a gift for my husband last Christmas and he loves it.  He was looking for a trimmer that was cordless and had different settings without having additional pieces to attach.  This product works great!  He uses it everyday and loves the simple features.  We&#x27;ve gone through a couple cheaper electric trimmers every year for the last couple years.  Although those trimmers cost only $20 they never held up and broke without warning.  Overall this is a great upgrade and a great product.</li>
            <li> I give it a 4 star just because the trimmer takes a bit more time in getting my beard trimmed ( but that might me just me though ).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, its a solid product and stands true to whatever it says on the description.</li>
            <li> After yet another extended and disappointing experience with my Braun CruZer (think I owned a 5, so I can&#x27;t comment on the 6) I gave this a try and feel is the best so far. I keep a full beard and use for trimming and shaping. After reading online reviews, I chose this as a replacement as it was described &amp;#34;no-frills, no-nonsense, one-pass trimmer.&amp;#34; Compared to the other mass-produced commercial brands, I suppose agree. Honestly, I would be willing to pay $200+ for a serious durable beard trimmer that is &#x27;truly&#x27; one-pass, but until then Ill stick with this one.</li>
            <li> Great shaver especially for under $50. With 19 settings it takes a couple trys to figure out the one your looking for. Also, continually oiling it is annoying but what can you do...</li>
            <li> i like it overall...that you can just wash it off and that you can&#x27;t lose the different heads. overall nice!</li>
            <li> Seems to do exactly what advertised. I&#x27;ve only had this for a few weeks but the trimmer works very well so far and the variable length settings are great.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have the ability to collect hair within the body like my prior shaver had, but I still like this more. The control over trimming length and ability to rinse/get wet is great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had 1 of these for about a year and decided it would make a good B-day present for my Twin bro...it works great and the charge last a long time, simple to clean...</li>
            <li> A little slow but cuts nice. I would have given it four stars but you must oil after every use. I never oiled my titanium shaver that I used for eight years before the battery crapped out.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money. Very very easy to change the depth setting. smooth cutting. No snags. Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Met my expectations, easy use, good blades and a decent battery life</li>
            <li> The trimmer was OK while it lasted, which was about half a year.&lt;br /&gt;Products may break, it happens, and this one supposedly has warranty.&lt;br /&gt;But then I encountered the worst customer service - terrible waste of time.</li>
            <li> I have bought some razors that don&#x27;t necessarily do a good job of trimming hair, but this one does the trick perfectly. If you want a razor that won&#x27;t cost you a fortune, go for this one.</li>
            <li> So far works great but  no charge level indicator.</li>
            <li> I use it all the time really great for trimming. The downside is that takes long time to charge but you do not use it a lot so it does last for awhile.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my 18 year old son to use for his first year in college during his \\&quot;No Shave November\\&quot; participation.  I guess the rules to that are that you can&#x27;t shave anything or trim anything, but when he came home for Thanksgiving, I had him try this out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He said that he liked it based on the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  Quick adjust dial.  The other ones that we have had have different shields that are easily lost and misplaced.  This one has it all built in.  For a 1 shave, it&#x27;s there, for a 1/2 shave, just click and it&#x27;s there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  The product is nice and neat.  It comes with a charger that is sleek and fits on the corner of a sink or vanity.  The trimmer is small and fits in the hand, so the sink space that it requires is minimal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  Clean up is easy.  It is water proof. And as of today, three weeks after getting it, he has not had an issue with using it and cleaning it with water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When he finally decided to get rid of the No Shave November beard, he used this trimmer at the lowest level to bring it within shaving length.  It didn&#x27;t cause irritation and did a good job for what it was asked to do.</li>
            <li> I have used a litany of corded and cordless shavers.  This one beats them all.  The dial allows you to easily and clearly select the comb length.  I use it to shave my head at the 1.5mm setting.  It has great battery life and the comb is perfect for getting those tough areas at the top of your ears.  It is also surprisingly small and light - much smaller and lighter than any other clippers I have used.  The fact that it is waterproof makes clean up really easy.</li>
            <li> Whoever designed this trimmer should be shaved in random spots and sent out into the public to apologize. The design leaves a gap between the blades and and the guard. When going around ANY contour on your face the contours fall into this gap and it gets shaved down to the skin as if you were using no guard. The results are an uneven patchy mess that you will have to completely shave to even out. Anyone who gave this trimmer 5 stars must be working with Beiber like scruff because this trimmer is useless for someone that actually wants to keep one even length.</li>
            <li> I got this for a Christmas gift and am very happy with it.  The unit is waterproof so I can use it in the shower (a must for me) and is made of very high quality.  The unit has a short trimming area (about an inch) which allows for precise trimming.  The unit has a turn dial for how long you want the hair, which is nice, you can also remove it to trim it down to nothing.  I use this for my face and mustache so I can have a stubble look and it works great.  I just let the shower run over it to get the hair clippings off of it, but it also has a water hole for letting water push through it and force hair out of the clipping end which is super nice for when it gets clogged.  It has a normal charge hold/cycle.  It seems to hold the charge for a good time (have yet to have to recharge it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with this and it works great on my beard, it offers precise control and just works great.  It is also very quiet and smooth.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s ideal to use this trimmer in the shower, but I also think the shower is the ideal place to trim a beard. If that sounds right to you then I think this is a fine choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hair kinda piles up from time to time while trimming, but if you can just turn around and rinse it into the tub it&#x27;s not that big of a deal. I think I used it 3 or 4 times before it sounded like it was running down, though it still worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Probably the only thing that really annoys me is that the indicator light on the charger doesn&#x27;t change when charging is complete.</li>
            <li> works great and have had no problem with it. My only concern (which got it 4 instead of five stars) is it wasn&#x27;t as robust  as I expected and I hope it lasts awhile...only time will tell.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my husband&#x27;s old trimmer. He loves the fact that you can rinse it under water to clean. Works really well and would definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> So far I like this product. Very simple to use. A dial to select how short you want to trim and an on/off button, and that&#x27;s pretty much it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The comb/guard detaches if you want to trim something really close. It sits in the charging cradle - you don&#x27;t have to actually plug it into anything. Just drop it in and it&#x27;s charging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do however have 2 small complaints about this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a little brush to clean it - but no place to put the brush. i think it would have been pretty easy to make a little slot on the charging station to store the brush. Pretty sure I&#x27;m going to lose that little brush in a week - assuming I didn&#x27;t already lose it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it comes with a little bottle of oil and according to the instructions, it says you are supposed to oil it before AND after EVERY use. That seems a little ridiculous to me. Not only that, but from the image shown in the instructions, it looks like you have to oil the INSIDE of the shaver head which would mean you&#x27;d have to remove two screws to gain access to the inside of the head. They have lost their minds if they think I&#x27;m going to take something apart TWICE every time I use it to oil it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m hoping it&#x27;s a typo in the instructions where it says you&#x27;re supposed to do this before and after every use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, one other very minor thing  - you can not use this while charging. Since there&#x27;s nothing to actually plug into the shaver, you have to leave it in the charging cradle for it to charge. Which means if the battery goes dead and you want to use it really quickly, you have to wait for it to charge up a bit before you can use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since this is made to work wet or dry though, I&#x27;m not really surprised that it can&#x27;t be plugged in since I doubt they want someone doing something foolish like stepping into the shower holding something plugged into an outlet :)</li>
            <li> No exaggeration. After about an hour of going over the same small spots 20 times or more, I gave up. IT DOES NOT CUT EVENLY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the whole hour, here was my routine: I&#x27;d trim over about a 2 inch strip of beard, turn the thing off, take it apart, clear out every little hair, put it back together, turn it on, and repeat. OVER AND OVER ON THE SAME SPOTS. By the time I quit, my beard looked like a bad joke from an \\&quot;as seen on TV\\&quot; commercial, showing how the other guy&#x27;s trimmer leaves you patchy. I couldn&#x27;t believe it. I had charged the trimmer about 18 hours overnight before first use. I also oiled it before, and twice during (just in case). I had it set to 6mm. My beard was at about 10mm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I gave up, I got out my 10 year old, busted Remington hair trimmer and finished the job in 5 minutes. It literally has broken teeth, and it did so much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a piece of junk. At least I can return it.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend&#x27;s old trimmer finally died, and he insisted that he was just going to start shaving. I didn&#x27;t like it at all, so I searched around and found this trimmer. He uses it in the shower (one of his must-haves) and it&#x27;s great. Easy to use and the water hasn&#x27;t seemed to effect it at all. He&#x27;s been using it for about a year now and he&#x27;s been pretty happy with it. It holds a charge for quite a long time too.</li>
            <li> I found this trimmer in a segment of Men&#x27;s Health. I had been thinking about getting a new trimmer to replace an ancient one of mine and the article I saw sparked my interest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read a lot of the reviews before I purchased. I&#x27;ve had my trimmer for over a month now and I use it about every other day. Never once had it pulled or snagged on my hair (face or chest). I&#x27;ve got a thick, coarse beard, and I enjoy how this trimmer really lets me customize how close I want my hair. I&#x27;ve also used my trimmer in the shower and I&#x27;ve used it dry. The people at Panasonic got it right - it truly is a wet/dry trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charging cradle is a nice piece of this package, but I wish it had a charging timer or a battery bar to show how much power still remains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did buy some oil for the trimmer even though it comes with a very small bottle. I envision keeping this product around for awhile, so why not take care of it? I haven&#x27;t used the oil after every use (as some people have suggested). My plan is to use the oil once a month, and go from there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is well worth the money. It works well, looks like a solid product, and performs right on target. Get yourself one! It&#x27;ll simply your grooming routine.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after reading the reviews. I wish I would have stuck with vacuum Phillip Norelco that I had before. This product head broke after only 5 uses. It&#x27;s now a $50 piece of junk. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone. Stay with the products you know. I&#x27;m disappointed in Panasonic because most of my house hold electronics are Panasonic brand.</li>
            <li> over the years, i have purchased various trimmers from different brands and for the most part it has been different product, same result. well, with this trimmer it&#x27;s different product and different result. unlike other beard trimmers, i get an even shave with few (if any) missed/ stray hairs. moreover, i don&#x27;t have to shave with as many passes, which cuts down my shaving time considerably. i also love the fact that the trimmer adjusts in 0.5 mm increments whereas other trimmers jump by 1.5 mm at some increments. no more settling for the closest setting. i get the length i want without having to keep my beard just a bit shorter or longer than i&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> No the best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever had, but not the worst either. Pulled hairs and actually nicked sensitive areas when using the shaver with no attachments.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say this beard trimmer does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to. Also, you can use it in the shower and clean it with water, so that&#x27;s convenient. That being said, it&#x27;s the only beard trimmer I&#x27;ve used so it&#x27;s difficult for me to compare to any others. I&#x27;m satisfied but maybe I just don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m missing.</li>
            <li> works well......owned for a bunch of months......long lasting charge too</li>
            <li> So this beard trimmer is great at getting your hairs down to 10mm or shorter. Also, you can take the little guard thing off and it rocks at doing fine-tune edge work. If you&#x27;re looking to do haircuts, its also mighty enough to do that, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend doing yourself. I used it in conjunction with a normal hair comb on my buddy and it worked well. Clippers that are designed to be doing full haircuts have longer comb attachments than this one. Since this is pretty much meant for beards and nether regions, I can vouch that it works great for both of those things.    One problem is that there&#x27;s no indicator to tell you its done charging. You just kinda scratch your head and remember if you plugged it in 15 to 20 hours ago and say I guess its good.    Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> Best bears trimmer I&#x27;ve ever purchased.</li>
            <li> Very bad did not work with me, but only one day and tried to communicate with the seller, and so I could not Adhan abused as worthy assessment of the piece and may be faulty at the item and found I do not blame this model to read</li>
            <li> You have to oil before and after each use....Really!?!?!  Not quite the convenience I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> Awesome! Finally found a real trimmer! Not only is it the best but you can bring it into the shower!</li>
            <li> I have zero complaints about this trimmer. It does exactly what I want it to do and does it well. Easy to use, easy to clean, easy to love.</li>
            <li> Item was awesome  Best trimmers i have ever had</li>
            <li> Shipping was on time. Trimmer is working great for me. I like using the trimmer in the shower the best for my beard.</li>
            <li> What I mean is, as far as the other comments and You Tube Vids were concerned  I had higher expectations for this product.  I was hoping I could just jump in the shower every two or three days and touch up mu #3 buzz cut, didn&#x27;t work for me. But if I set down and my wife uses it to touch-up my dooo the results are acceptable. The deal for me is I have a Wahl for that, so this was just money down the drain for me.</li>
            <li> This is a new version of my husbands old trimmer it was the same one that lasted for many many years and it died so we needed it replaced, he absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> As you can guess this thing can cut hair. If you have thick hair it has some trouble. As a Sasquatch, the trimmer did not cut through the rough.....however if you are looking to keep yourself looking like a nice European model, then you have found the right trimmer. It does a nice job with the facial follicles and has plenty of adjustments from sandpaper skin to full on hobo. Goodnight and Good luck Folks....We will see you next fall.</li>
            <li> Long battery life, lots of adjustments, does well on both beard and moustache</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very well made. Nice rubberized grip won&#x27;t slip. The adjustable blade guide is great instead of having to deal with multiple attachments. Waterproof. Easy to clean and care for. Keeps a charge for a long time (took it on vacation for a week without the charger and had no problems).&lt;br /&gt;Keep the blade attachment oiled per the manufacturers instructions and you should have a razor that last for a long time.</li>
            <li> Great quality feel, very smooth.</li>
            <li> Except for oiling l&#x27;m enjoying the performance of the razor.</li>
            <li> Gives a great range of choice for body and beard trimming.  Great for daily beard trimming to just that right tight trim level for the slightly more than stubble look.  Lighter than my Wahl head trimmer, and the wet shave capability really sold me on this as an everyday device.  Even cleaned up my eyebrows.  Have not used the Panasonic without the trimmer head (1MM) but it does a good job with it on, so why bother.  I highly recommend and the price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> This thing gets through all kinds of hair (and I mean all kinds of hair) very, very well.  Plus you can rinse it, which makes cleaning a breeze.  Holds its charge for a long time - didn&#x27;t charge it for a month, went to use it again and it was fine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for about a month now. It&#x27;s easy to use, does a good job of cutting the hairs uniformly, and the selector gives you a lot of options by the 1/2 mm. I haven&#x27;t been real successful one-handing the trimmer and changing the selector at the same time; however, not a real big issue. It&#x27;s MESSY though. Hairs go all over whatever is below your face as well as the trimmer. I don&#x27;t necessarily blame the manufacturers for that (thus the 5 star rating), but just a heads up. There&#x27;s a special water port specifically designed for rinsing - so far, not helping tremendously. Glad I got it.</li>
            <li> I got these clippers the other day. They are awesome. I used them to trim my hair. Unbelievable close hair cut. Fits nice to the head......you have to buy to experience how great they are....I will definitely be buying these again.</li>
            <li> I bought it a month ago and I&#x27;m very pleased by its performance. I used to have an old body trimmer which I considered it was good after years of usage, but after using this one you feel the difference, and the best of all is that this device is quieter.</li>
            <li> My favorite shaver yet. You can do it in the shower! And it&#x27;s easy to clean. Easy to adjust.  Get it.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my son. He researched and compared different products and chose this one.  He is happy with it.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised. If used for only brief periods charge lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is quiet and works well. It holds a charge for a long time. The only down fall to this item is it is a little big when using on your face.</li>
            <li> I bought this item because my kids always loose the little attachments that come with a regular hair trimmer and this one has it built in I did my hair with it with great results and i would recommend it to anyone thinking of buying a hair trimmer</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s okay. i prefer my old Norelco Acuvac over this one. Nice design; like the charging cradle; seem well built; but just not as good as some of my older trimmers</li>
            <li> Great cordless trimmer with adjustable settings so there is no adapters to lose.</li>
            <li> Very Good Trimmer. Works Very well. Panasonic was fantastic. They give me the full refund when I has a issue with the trimmer.</li>
            <li> After reading many reviews I decided to purchase the Panasonic Milano Series ER-GB40-S Hair &amp; Body Trimmer and I&#x27;m very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Works great for beard trimming.  I also use it on my head, and I&#x27;ve got a thick full head of hair.  I&#x27;d give it five stars if the head were wider than 1in and it was a little more powerful for a faster haircut.  But it gets the job done everyday.</li>
            <li> Nice product, I like the wet/dry ability. It does pull on my beard at times, but works fine for shaving my head.</li>
            <li> This product helps you keep your beard trimmed so you can avoid ingrown hairs and has a lot of cool features.  Water resistant.  Only drawback is prior to first use you need to charge it for a LONG time.  Otherwise perfect thus far.</li>
            <li> Even after charging for a whole day, the charge does not hold even for a single shave. There  are no indications for battery level as well.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my grandson as a gift and he loves it.  Says it not only &amp;#34;shapes&amp;#34; his beard but also works well when he is shaving his neck.  What he loves mostly, he can use it in the shower.</li>
            <li> I never use this in the shower, but it works beautifully.  It is relatively quiet and cuts fast, and with the adjustable head height it is easy to trim body hair in different areas.  The fact that it can get wet assures cleaning is easy and I probably only oil it once a month.  I use it primarily to trim my beard, this is the third trimmer that I have owned and this one is the best by far.</li>
            <li> if you are hairy and you are gonna use it for your body let me tell you that it&#x27;s not gonna work. I dont know why it&#x27;s advertised as bread and body trimmer. The product and Panasonic website say it&#x27;s a beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> My husband needed a new trimmer for his beard, and since I had no first hand experience...I read review after review. He really likes this one, and when (or if) it does die...we will buy another one just like it. He said the attachments make it very versatile, and it is a good quality trimmer.</li>
            <li> Good quality product, sharp &amp; well designed. I would buy again without hesitation, battery life is reasonable and so far product has performed well after some use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely happy with the performance of this trimmer.  I&#x27;ve gone about 6 years with something bought for about $15-20, and needed an upgrade.  My trimming time has been cut in half, as this trimmer is actually able to cut the hairs in a single pass (Imagine That!).  The fact that it is waterproof and can be run under the faucet for cleaning is another amazing perk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downfall is the maximum length is only 10mm.  My beard might look a little short for the first couple of days, but I&#x27;m a happy guy.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is top notch.  The adjustability on the length of your beard is spot on.  Its extremely quiet and stays charged up for weeks without being placed back on the charger.  I highly suggest this trimmer for anyone looking!</li>
            <li> Cuts hair so fast you definitely don&#x27;t want to trim too fast around the neckline with this monster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My poor beard died so fast I didn&#x27;t even notice untill it was too late.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though you killed my beard Panasonic, you still get a 5 star.</li>
            <li> I bought a $20 dollar trimmer from sears, you plug it in, and its not waterproof. It does a much faster job than this. The water proof part of this product is gimmicky. If you intend to use this in the shower, your warm water will run out before you finish and the trimming will be spotty. Out of the shower the same power issues exist. The same problem with quality. I gave it one extra star because at least it really is water proof.</li>
            <li> Great trim, even in a heavy beard. Battery lasts for 2-3 months on a single charge.</li>
            <li> Great shaver.  My wife loves that I can use it in the shower instead of making a mess at the sink.</li>
            <li> I guess if you don&#x27;t mind going across the same spot 100x&#x27;s it awesome! I love Panasonic products so I figured I would give it a shot. It&#x27;s waterproof and it&#x27;s a quality product. I doubt other ones are much better. So if this is what you are looking for look no further. I just think it&#x27;s inherent to the design of these products that they work like they do which is well.. crappy. It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, you just need to but more time into it than I am willing to put in I guess. Battery life and power are adequate don&#x27;t be convinced that lithium ion is where it&#x27;s at..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This replaced a Phillips Norelco that the interchangeable guard &amp; head w/ various attachments that kept falling off. This is far superior to that one.</li>
            <li> great reviews on the internet for this one, kinda why i got it, for what i was looking for this fit the bill, i got it for mostly body hair, so great for shure, lots of adjustment in the head, easy to use</li>
            <li> Manscapers will love this one. I know I do. It holds a charge for a long time, and the best thing is that it is super quiet. I mean like whisper quiet. The twist adjustment allows any length choice and the gears are strong. The look of it is so modern on the bathroom counter that it is consistent with a 21st century life upgrade.</li>
            <li> Works underwater...aquaman approved</li>
            <li> excellent incremental adjustments and easy to clean</li>
            <li> works really well in water or out.  Holds charge pretty well</li>
            <li> Great trimmer.  Use it daily and it does a great job.</li>
            <li> As soon as I got it out of the box and charged and turned on, it sounded a bit weak compared to my last trimmer.  I tried it out and it seemed alright for the first week or so, but it eventually just pooped out and the already weak motor slowed down to the point where the blades were grabbing hairs instead of cutting them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually bought this and the &amp;#34;Philips Norelco QG3360/42 Multigroom Plus&amp;#34; at the same time to pick the best one, but wound up returning that as well.  The Philips felt more powerful, but the way the trimmer guard attached to it was very flimsy and one fall would probably break it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still looking for a good trimmer...</li>
            <li> Overall the best body trimmer I have found. Holds a charge well, doesn&#x27;t snag skin, and works as advertised.</li>
            <li> this one is mid range in price but it seems to be better than all of the ones that I have tried before.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want a star trek phaser</li>
            <li> Works great. Really nice length adjustment.</li>
            <li> Keeps a great charge and definitely works in or out of the shower.</li>
            <li> Best beard and mustache trimmer I have ever had</li>
            <li> I thought the shaving length was in line with standard clippers, but it is not.  The #2 on this is in MM, so 2 is very very short versus a #2 clipper guard.</li>
            <li> Outstanding product - adjustable settings gets the look you are going for - highly recommend this trimmer.</li>
            <li> Durable. Easy to adjust. Easy to charge. Battery strong. Feels good in hand.  Well done, Panasonic.</li>
            <li> Still Working After Three Months</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my husband and he loves it.  He decided to grow a beard and mustache and this trimmer and shaver works terrific!  It is easy to use and is very versatile.  It&#x27;s worth the money too!</li>
            <li> I thought this would be an excellent product for my needs, boy was I mistaken.  Do not use this trimmer for your downstairs body hair.  I had to go to the E.R. because my pubes got tangled in the cutter head and caused a razor burn on my gooch.  My junk is now bruised, scarred, and I now have a rash from the razor burn.  As a homosexual man it&#x27;s important to stay groomed, but this product is a definite no.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to spend this much money on an electric shaver,  I figured they were all pretty much the same so why buy an expensive one.  This thing is worth every penny,  the adjustment dial is really nice,  it is very light and fits comfortably in your hand.  The small blow out port or rinse out port is a nice feature.  If you buy it you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very good product take in the shower cuts fantastic, hell you can use it to shave with my only problem with it is that it is not a smart battery system and chargerit could be so much better if it would turn itself off when charging was finished so you can leave it on its dock full time other than that it&#x27;s fantastic all I do is turn it around so it&#x27;s not charging any more!</li>
            <li> Best trimmer I&#x27;ve bought. I&#x27;ve owned many brands. Smart, easy, effective. The one I&#x27;ve been waiting for. Buy this trimmer.</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer because i read a review in a mens magazine that picked it above all other beard trimmers.  I dont know if panasonic is paying this magazine because the trimmer isnt much better than an inexpensive one i bought at k mart a few years ago.  I DO LIKE the adjustment for the length, but it still takes multiple, (like 5!) passes until my beard doesnt look patchy.  When you go to the barber they take a couple of passes on your head but not nearly like what this trimmer needs.  This is my third trimmer, I still havent found one I like, I guess I will need something industrial.  Aside from that I like it</li>
            <li> Excellent product thank you.</li>
            <li> According to Men&#x27;s Health this is the best trimmer in the market and really is.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use and charge.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it. I had been using much cheaper styles in the past. This blows them away.  No complaints yet.</li>
            <li> WOW! This is a very well made trimmer!  The dial allows for all, I mean all, lengths and styles!  The best trimmer i have ever bought!  HIGHLY recommend it.  Silent, strong, quality product.</li>
            <li> Though I don&#x27;t use this to shaver in the shower, it is a waterproof device. I do use this shaver to pre-shave my head and facial whiskers before hand shaving with a Gillette mechanical shaver to get the shine that I most enjoy. The Panasonic is easy to clean and oil for proper preventative maintenance. This tool is comfortable for me to hold. It also works well doing a full pass from the back of my neck to my cheek and chin area. It has remained sharp (keep the oil maintenance up) for the months that I have owned it. I remain very happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> Like that it&#x27;s waterproof.  Wish the guard don&#x27;t feel so cheap though.</li>
            <li> Worth the price and then some.  Works well, cleans easy and is very ergonomic and quiet.  Settings give you great range of beard lengths.  Powerful and stays charged a good while.  Good value.</li>
            <li> I have used many trimmers in the past and the Remington brand worked great. But this one is better and it&#x27;s water proof. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is a nice product, could use a little more power but all in all is a nice product. I like it and use it at least 3 times a week.</li>
            <li> This thing works great.  Easy to clean and use.</li>
            <li> Yes I like it very much. Should have bought it a long time ago. It makes trimming by beard and mustache much easier</li>
            <li> best shaving unit I have ever used...  very happy with it</li>
            <li> very precise and versatile</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s solid. But you have to keep oiling it. Hard to clean. But worth the money.</li>
            <li> Love it easy to use and quiet.</li>
            <li> Everything about this trimmer is great except that it is woefully underpowered- and that makes it just okay. It can handle very light trimming fairly well, but anything beyond that the motor will begin to slow down and the cutting action suffers.</li>
            <li> So far so good. I have used it twice and it cuts very well. The adjustment depth is very easy to use and the ergonomics are very good.</li>
            <li> Works great but the settings are not calibrated right. After you figure out the settings it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought probably five or six similar style razors in the last decade; each was flawed in one or more ways.  This bad boy, however, addresses every need my face has, and that it&#x27;s completely waterproof is the icing on the cake.  It can be precisely dialed to your chosen length, doesn&#x27;t need to pass over the face 200 times to get all the hairs (though multiple passes are necessary if you&#x27;re in the very low settings), and it navigates smoothly around my mustache.  Being able to use it in the shower means no sink full of hair and the charging base is smartly designed.  In short, the razor for which I&#x27;ve been searching.</li>
            <li> Great trimmer.  Holds charge for a long time.  Have not used it wet, but dry trimming works very well.  It is a better beard trimmer than a mustache trimmer.  If you are trimming mostly beard and a little mustache it is great, but I would not recommend it solely as a mustache trimmer.  The adjustable dial makes setting the cutting length easy.  Caution...start out on the higher settings and work down to find the length you want.</li>
            <li> Worked as expected, great battery life.</li>
            <li> This was my second purchase of same product from amazon, i was really amazed by the first one, but this time Blades of the trimmer hurts.</li>
            <li> Love this...  take it in the shower, or shave at sink.  holds a good change and I can travel with it and not worry about taking the charger.</li>
            <li> Works great for the price, however it is bit difficult when cleaning. Pouring water into a small hole to remove tiny bits of hair gets tedious.</li>
            <li> The trimmer makes it very easy to keep my beard neat and at a uniform length. It has not succeeded in convincing my wife that uniform longer is okay, but winning arguments wasn&#x27;t advertised as a feature.</li>
            <li> Great product. I have recently started a beard and have not had one for decades. This is a very to use product and it is able to do a smooth job without pulling the hair out by the roots. I only wish that it could have more than a 10mm range. Perhaps the next model could have an attachment that could go on it. If you find those few &amp;#34;wild&amp;#34; hairs that always come up, this will get them!</li>
            <li> I have always been very satisfied with Panasonic products. Usually they are well thought out, and have always been very reliable and durable. Thus I had high hopes for this trimmer. Although it undoubtedly will be reliable and durable, this trimmer is merely adequate and nothing more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has two key weaknesses. First, its shortest setting will not give a beard or mustache that three day growth look which is currently popular. It looks more like 10 days of growth. Second, it seems almost underpowered; definitely does not have extra power to spare. This is not really a problem for my beard, which is relatively average. Yet, any man who has a thick or heavy beard might be very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does have a couple of nice features. The length adjustment is simple and straight forward despite not having a truly short setting. It also feels good in the hand, and works smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to keep this Panasonic because I was tired of shopping around, and had already returned a [[ASIN:B00ARF428O Philips Norelco Multigroom]] which had the flimsiest attachments one could imagine.</li>
            <li> can only use in shower without the guard on. This product is definitely more geared for face and head, not body.</li>
            <li> I wish I could give it an extra half-star. I enjoy the simplicity of the trimmer quite a bit. I do wish the head was a bit smaller for more even strokes, as sometimes going perpendicular to the jawline can lead to a shorter cut just under the jaw.</li>
            <li> It works really well. So nice to be able to trim in the shower. The charger is nice and the clipper is well designed.</li>
            <li> Best trimmer that i have ever tried or bought. cuts well and easy to clean since u can run this under water with no problems. just make sure its dry before recharging it obviously. lightwieght and easy to hold as it has a rubber grip handle. i also use it to cut my hair( crew cut) and it works quite well.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband, and it works well for hair trimming in the shower.</li>
            <li> This thing works great it trims my beard in no time without pulling or leaving stray hairs, I have not tried using it in the shower yet but it does says its water resistant.</li>
            <li> Skeptical at first as all my prior trimmers died after getting wet. This is the best one so far may never try others again?</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t have enough power if you want to cut your hair</li>
            <li> Perfect design to set the triming length. and i got it at 50% off price. Can be used for wet shaving too</li>
            <li> I always use this trimmer to shave my hair. Excellent design, very durable construction, soft and functional operation. Definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS RAZOR!! This razor exceeded my expectations. I love the adjustable dial and not having to switch guards in and out. Blades seem to be made with quality and are very sharp. One complaint I have is it doesn&#x27;t get close to remove short stubble around my neck which isn&#x27;t a major deal as I clean up with a normal razor w/ cream. I have suggested this razor to others at work as our company recently allowed men to have facial hair.</li>
            <li> Not bad but not great.</li>
            <li> It is comfortable as there is no cord&lt;br /&gt;It is safe, no chance to cut your skin even if you are in a rush to trim your beard or genital hair&lt;br /&gt;I dropped it from my hand 2-3 times but luckily there wasn&#x27;t any damage&lt;br /&gt;I used it in shower and it works as it is supposed to&lt;br /&gt;I charge it in every 20 days means if you charge it once, you can use it for over an hour&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I recommend everyone to buy it, may be it costs a lil more than the other trimmers, bt it is surely worth</li>
            <li> easy to clean and plows through a beard without any issue.</li>
            <li> Used to fight with my shaver to get the right setting and or to keep it on the right setting. This thing is a jewel in the rough. Short of its longer than some blade it is an awesome tool to keep my beard in check. It is efficient and can be washed in water or used in shower just make sure you keep oiling the blades as required by the owners manual.</li>
            <li> I own three different trimmers. First one was a very old panasonic one which used to always get stuck and then I got Phillips Norelco which I still like it. But having heard from others about this product, I thought why not try this one too. I keep multiple blades and use my trimmer for both body and beard. But now I use this Panasonic only for beard. The best thing about this is effective length adjustment feature. I just love that part and it is very convenient to use. However something that I don&#x27;t like about it is I always feel it needs to have more power. Having used Phillips Norelco, I feel this one lacks that punch in terms of power. I heard about people having issues with the broadness but I think for beard trimming its fine. One thing you have to be careful is to use the trimmer from one direction only which means the part of blade not facing the start button. BY chance you do use it from other side with the start button facing you, DAMN IT you are in trouble. I did this once and I had a big patch. It gave me a clean shave. I was extremely annoyed about it. Another annoying thing is - for such a small unit, they could have easily made it for 110V to 230V range. These guys have it only for 110V! How stupid is that!! I travel a lot and I had to buy a convertor for this purpose. These are two reasons that I give this 3 star rating. I don&#x27;t know how it would work for body grooming but with the kind of power it has, I doubt it will be good and also broadness of the blade might be an issue.</li>
            <li> Smooth and comfortable. Easy to maneuver and easy on the face. Would very much recommend for trim and travel.&lt;br /&gt;Get it</li>
            <li> I am not one to usually write a review but i feel i have to warn the men out there:&lt;br /&gt;Note: I use my trimmer for my goatee and sideburns and i have coarse facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;I had a Wahl trimmer that served me well for several years and after it died, I decided to try the Panasonic ER-GB40-S. This is easily the worst trimmer i have ever encountered. I had to run it over an area 5 times for it to trim all the hair. It required multiple passes and pulled a few hairs off my chin (no matter what direction i ran it). This never happened with the Wahl (which i have promptly purchased). Truly a terrible razor, don&#x27;t but it!</li>
            <li> Awesome, works great. Best razor I&#x27;ve owned. Would suggest to a friends. 6 Months ownership no worries so far. Can use in shower.</li>
            <li> Shaves better than expected, very easy to set for correct beard length.</li>
            <li> I recently grew a beard; and I brought this to trim it. Once I dialed in the perfect setting for me; my results are always consistent. It&#x27;s quiet and feels good in my rather large hands.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like giving 5 star reviews willy nilly. For me, 3 stars &#x3D; meets expectations, 4 stars exceeds them, and 5 stars is for an exceptional product I could never do without again. It is the best beard trimmer I&#x27;ve owned to date. Body grooming performs as expected, but I&#x27;ve worked with better wired versions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 15 hour full charge doesn&#x27;t bother me because I&#x27;ve never had occasion to use it more than once a day.  In fact, the standby time is pretty impressive. I haven&#x27;t felt that typical low battery slow down that I associate with other cordless models. I&#x27;ve gone over a week without charging even though I use it nearly every day. I guess 50 minutes run time goes a long way when it takes only a minute or so to trim up the old beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also super easy to clean. The waterproof aspect is why I took a chance on it originally. Pull off the blade, rinse in the shower, done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I price watched before purchasing because it cost more than I wanted to spend. When it hit my target price I gave it a go &amp; I&#x27;ve been happy ever since. There might be something better or there, but you won&#x27;t regret this if ease of cleaning is a priority.</li>
            <li> The charger I had never use it it is the first time I charged and do not work.....I can&#x27;t contact the seller</li>
            <li> I really love these. Best cutters I have owned so far. Really love the dial for adjusting the cutting depth. I also have a Panasonic electric shaver, nose trimmer and camera. All are great products. And all are right here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Bought because I dropped my Remmington trimmer and broke the guard. This Panasonic doesn&#x27;t have near the power. If your beard gets long, you have to take it steps because it can&#x27;t trim a bunch at once. Also, to remove the guard can be tricky. I feel like I&#x27;m going to break it. Charging for me though has not been an issue.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my boyfriend and he loves it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a great design, a perfect charger, is so easy to clean and is built quite solidly.  Alas, the blade width is frustratingly small and the motor is weak.  Shaving a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow takes multiple passes over the same small area.  The trouble only increases when that beard is more like a 7 o&#x27;clock shadow.  I really thought this one was going to be great, and it&#x27;s barely good.</li>
            <li> i returned  this because unit sent to did allow full cleaning of cutter blade.</li>
            <li> This product stopped working after 8 months. That&#x27;s bad, especially considering I use it just once per week.</li>
            <li> Much better then the cheap 20$ walmart junk I bought first.</li>
            <li> unit not usable worldwide only works on 110 volt...would like to return...please advise</li>
            <li> This is quiet. It works great. I&#x27;ve had if for months now and have not needed to recharge it yet!</li>
            <li> This offers the best value (performance/cost) of all the many models I have used over the years.</li>
            <li> It gives a decent shave &amp; trim, and it with 19 individual settings, it&#x27;s just a matter of finding the right one for your needs. It&#x27;s really easy to clean, and it feels relatively solid, but the fact that the instructions tell you to oil the blades before each &amp; every use makes me wonder just how durable this is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d expect any rechargeable device to tell me how much charge remains; either graphically or with a simple warning light, but this trimmer does not. It would have been pretty easy &amp; cheap to include some kind of indicator on it, but Panasonic must have figured it would be even easier &amp; cheaper not to...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another annoying thing about this trimmer is that when the base is plugged in &amp; the trimmer is placed in the base, a red light turns on. To me, that would indicate that the trimmer&#x27;s contact points are properly aligned in the base, and the base is plugged in, and the trimmer is actively charging. I&#x27;d expect that red light to either shut off or turn green when the charge is complete, but it doesn&#x27;t. It always stays red, and it always stays illuminated. I want to know when the battery is fully charged so I can remove the trimmer &amp; save the battery from being overcharged, causing it to lose its ability to hold a charge. But, again, Panasonic chose to do otherwise.</li>
            <li> I used a different brand of shaver for several years... that worked, but the Panasonic Milano shaver is much better.  It is easy to use and I love the ability to use it wet... or dry.  I recommend it.</li>
            <li> just as described ...but better!&lt;br /&gt;price is fair, holds charge for long time, nice clean cut, great settings would definitely recommend!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve only been using it for about a month, but so far we are VERY happy with the product. We just need more time to determine how it will hold up.</li>
            <li> The trimmer works ok.  However, hair does clog it up quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have to take off the guard, brush out the hair and start.</li>
            <li> This works great, trims as expected, however be careful if you set the trim dial too low, you can trim more than you expect.  Cleans up easily without much effort, like that I can use in shower.</li>
            <li> The seller, DiscountJungle listed their product under hair and beard trimmer when all along it was a body hair trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;This was false on their part and they charged me a 15% restocking fee!</li>
            <li> I needed a grooming tool to keep my beard closely cropped.  However,  I didn&#x27;t want to butcher it in the process.  This Panasonic adjustable razor head with comb does the trick.  I recommend this product highly and it is reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> finally, a beard trimmer with accuracy and ease of use. It is durable too. I have had bad luck with attachments in the past, but this machine is awesome. The guard comes on and off easily and stays where you put it. No more slips and bare patches in my beard. I love it, and it hold a charge well. Gotta love the wet or dry cleaning too. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- a year later: I still use this guy, but I dropped in the sink and it will no longer retain the comb guide. It only fell about a foot. I now have to hold the guide down while shaving. I replaced the guides, but what broke is the internal clip. bummer.</li>
            <li> My fiancé loves this item.  He uses it to keep his beard groomed without any fuss.  He usually groans at the thought of having to clean up his beard (he keeps it short) but not with this tool.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well. No complains.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to take the 5 star people and make them use this trimmer. I&#x27;m 43 with a regular beard...not a heavy beard. With the guard on you need a couple of spare hours to trim your beard evenly. It simply DOES NOT WORK AS DESCRIBED. With the guard off you can actually trim your beard but, It rips/tears the hairs out. That is when it doesn&#x27;t bind up without warning and hang off your lip with you squealing trying to free what feels like a 5 pound weight off your face. These two minor details are nothing compared to when it arbitrarily decides to stab a hole in your face...the blood makes you look tough. I like my 8 year old remmington.</li>
            <li> Had used a much cheaper Remington trimmer before that needed a cheap repair.  Decided to &amp;#34;splurge&amp;#34; on this instead of fixing the old one.  Simply no comparison.  This is far superior.  So glad I got it.  Consistent trimming is so much easier with its dial adjustment.  Feels solid and well built.</li>
            <li> I have had this product for about 2 years and every so ofter I have to clean it out and lube a few part as directed in the owners manual.  This is an awesome beard trimmer.  Would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Beautiful machine! The build quality is excellent. This is now one of my favorite possessions. The best male groomer on the market for sure. I would pay $100 for this item. Thanks for making such a great product Panasonic.</li>
            <li> Works very easily.  Easy to clean.  Easy to handle.</li>
            <li> Fantastic shaver. I&#x27;m able to trim my beard and shape it exactly how I want at the exact length that I want it. It also allows me to shave the back of my neck without issue. Plus it&#x27;s easy to clean as it can get wet.</li>
            <li> I have had it for more than year now. Love it...Keeps the charge for days and sometimes months together which is a great thing.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this trimmer.  It provides an even, consistent, and fully adjustable trim and is so easy to clean.  I have used at least once a week for several months now and I have absolutely no complaints.</li>
            <li> Excellent razor. Quiet, holds a good charge,easy to use and clean.I&#x27;ve had other beard trimmers/razors and they did not come close to this model. I recommend this product if you need a beard,mustache razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this a couple weeks and you can read far more detailed reviews from others.  I would agree with some that the motor seems underpowered and it gets a bit bogged down when you move too quickly through hair.  I love that you can just dial a length and not have to change attachments and that it is cordless.  But compared to my corded Wahl unit it cuts less efficiently and the cutting width is about half what the Wahl&#x27;s is.  That&#x27;s good for hitting some spots but adds to the time needed to trim larger areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess it&#x27;s worth the roughly $45 but if power is an issue for you then I&#x27;d look for something else.</li>
            <li> My husband really likes this. Uses it all the time.</li>
            <li> Does it&#x27;s job exactly as advertised.  Well thought out and well delivered.  Highly recommended.  Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to know how long the batter lasts.</li>
            <li> My husband has used several different types of razors and clippers.  He is very happy with this trimmer and its features.</li>
            <li> My old Philips Norelco beard trimmer finally died after years of use and so I started hunting for its replacement.  Well, consider me a huge fan of the Panasonic Milano Series ER-GB40-S Hair &amp; Body Trimmer.  My initial thoughts after a few uses.  I prefer beard trimmers to cut my hair (I cut it short) and this one has a fine blade that cuts closer than my Norelco did, is quiet to use, and the ergonomic design pleasantly surprised me.  Easy to clean up, too.  My only &amp;#34;concern&amp;#34; is the removable guard, which is a concern for any piece of plastic. But all that said, I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> excellent trimmer, works very well, water resistant&lt;br /&gt;would highly recommend it</li>
            <li> As a &amp;#34;foliclely challenged&amp;#34; male, it just makes more sense to trim my own hair and beard extra-short, and this trimmer works great.  I prefer to trim in the shower to speed clean-up, and since this trimmer is water-proof, I&#x27;m not worried about it.  The battery last long enough for me to trim my entire head and beard with no issues.  Pull of the adjustable head, rinse off the cutting head, put a couple drops of oil on it, drop it in the charger and I&#x27;m ready for next time.</li>
            <li> Good clipper.  I use it on my head.  I keep it shaved to about 2mm.  Not professional grade by any means.  But it&#x27;s very handy.  Cutting lengths adjust quickly.  You have to go over an area more than once to make sure you get good coverage.  But it&#x27;s lightweight and works very well in or out of the shower.</li>
            <li> As an athlete, I prefer a close cut to the hassle of using shaving blades.  I can&#x27;t say how many times I&amp;#34;ve cut myself with regular clippers because the protective combs were too long or useless.  This wireless unit is fantastic.  Easy to change the cut length, and never nick myself again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it.</li>
            <li> My charger blew out in 8 months.  I bought this shaver brand new for $49. Panasonic would not replace plastic charger and said I had to buy it. The BEST part is, the charger ( a plastic stand w a plug), they said it would be $50 to replace with shipping. Hahahaha more expensive than buying brand new.  I sat on the phone for an hour trying to see how that&#x27;s even possible.  COMPLETE waste of time. They refused to back it up. I will NEVER buy Panasonic product again. If there this cheap with a $3 plastic part, I can only imagine what&#x27;s it like with a tv. NO WAY!!!!  STAY AWAY</li>
            <li> First shaver I&#x27;ve found thats great quality for the price.  Wet Dry feature is fantastic and I have purchased 3 of them for gifts for my friends.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok but needs more power</li>
            <li> This trimmer is easy to adjust and it works pretty well. It does seem a little underpowered.</li>
            <li> I thought twice about paying the price, but this trimmer is worth every penny. Extremely well made, the trimming level set by mm ensures that I can quickly trim my &#x27;stache and &#x27;burns at the right level every day in a jiff. I am plagued/gifted with very fast growing facial hair, so I wonder why I never went this route before.  Given the quality, I probably will never have to replace it.  UPDATE: From initial charge on Sept 23, I used this daily until Dec 16 WITHOUT A CHARGE!  Pretty amazing quality of battery.  Given that Panasonic is one of the top two manufacturers of Nickel-metal hydride batteries in the world, I shouldn&#x27;t have been surprised.</li>
            <li> Has great power and long battery life! Ordered 4 for all the men in my life and they all love it.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this item from a different company that guaranteed it for life and charged more than double the Amazon price plus shipping charges. I had purchased it about 2 weeks before Christmas and within a week of Christmas was informed that it was back ordered and would not be delivered until January. I went to Amazon and found this exact same item for sale for less than half the price and guaranteed to be shipped to arrive before Christmas with no charge for shipping. The item arrived on time and the recipient reported that he was very pleased with the quality and performance of the product. It wasn&#x27;t gauranteed for life but for the price difference I&#x27;ll garantee it myself!</li>
            <li> Works great. Even though the motor sounds a little underpowered it never bogged down. The guard is also very comfortable to run across your face unlike my last trimmer. Also, cleaning is a snap since it can just be run under the faucet. My only critism is that it takes 24 hours to charge this thing when you first get it and 15 hours each full recharge afterward. 15 hours is a pretty absurd amount of time to charge anything from a wall outlet. I&#x27;ve got cordless drills that charge faster. This wouldn&#x27;t be a major problem with other shavers, but since it&#x27;s a sealed device you can&#x27;t just plug it in and keep going if the battery gets low or you forgot to charge it. In short it&#x27;s an awesome trimmer, but you better remember to slap it back on the charger when you&#x27;re done.</li>
            <li> The unit performs great with the  adjustable  settings and the  cordless operation too!</li>
            <li> Excellent trimmer for hair and beard. Works much better than the Wahl trimmer I had previously. I have used it both on my hair and my beard and it dose a nice job on both. Easy to clean and battery last a long time. I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> awful rips your hair out and doesn&#x27;t shave close at all</li>
            <li> Really enjoy this trimmer.  I was a little tentative at first when I took it into the shower with me, but it works even better than I expected.  Cleanup can be a real chore with some trimmers, but this one washes off clean in seconds.</li>
            <li> Stay&#x27;s charged for a long time.</li>
            <li> great trimmer!&lt;br /&gt;very good for short beard like i have because of the many length steps that can be configured. 1mm and 0,5mm steps helps getting better control over the short length.&lt;br /&gt;the battery life is very good, but needs full charge to work the best. I charge it between the shaves, and bring it to my trips without charger when i leave for 2 weeks or less.&lt;br /&gt;i also use this to have parts of my head. (i have 4mm shaved sides) and it works great for my thick asian hair.&lt;br /&gt;A very good feature is the oil that comes with the trimmer. i tryo to oil it in every week to maintain it.&lt;br /&gt;It is so so easy to clean, and it is water proof of course so that i can use it in the shower and clean it in the sink etc.</li>
            <li> Found myself with a beard for the first time. I looked for the best reviewed trimmer and ordered this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;It is very easy to use, fast to adjust, and easy to clean (just rinse the cutting blades in the sink for 10 seconds, wipe off, and put a drop of oil back on the blades).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy and simple adjustments for a huge range of lengths.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adjusts many increments up to 19mm or about 3/4 inch, which means even &amp;#62;1&amp;#34; thick beards may be OK because of the way the comb works. All those little hairs that insist on going straight outward get chopped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go with the grain for smoothing and wild hair removal. Go aganst the grain at a longer setting for shortening.&lt;br /&gt;So easy to use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No need for a box of attachments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con&lt;br /&gt;Oiling the internal parts could be made easier. Takes 5 minutes once a week or so for internal oiling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
            <li> I took a chance buying this for my husband, since he&#x27;s very particular about how he shaves.  It&#x27;s been almost a year and no complaints, he really likes it, thank goodness for both of us! ;)</li>
            <li> Perfect for my beard grooming needs</li>
            <li> not bad so far. I already lost the oil that came with it though.</li>
            <li> Great trimmer that I&#x27;ve been very happy with...have tried many trimmers and this one is the one!</li>
            <li> works great love it! long battery life too!</li>
            <li> I have owned a Panasonic wet/dry shaver in the past and it was time for a new one. I decided on this shaver based on the reviews and it has work great so far. It is a little bit of a pain to oil it regularly, but normal upkeep should be standard so I can&#x27;t really complain.</li>
            <li> I do not have to go to barber for a cut.&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to handle for cutting.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love that this shaver has multiple settings such as 2.0, 2.5 length for those days you may want the scruff to be a bit longer or tighter. Long lasting battery life.</li>
            <li> great  trimmer,  my  new #1! and  great value as well</li>
            <li> Clippers do not cut beard evenly.  Cut beard collects in guides</li>
            <li> This trimmer is a pleasure to use. Light, precise. Love the incremental adjustments. Some reviewers quibble that you have to make several passes in order to get an even trim. Of course you do: that&#x27;s how beards are, that&#x27;s how shaving works. Yes, the instructions to apply oil both before and after every use, but I&#x27;ll be that&#x27;s only necessary if you use the unit in the shower or wash it with water. But why would you want to do either? Using the trimmer in wet conditions is exactly as desirable as mowing your lawn in the rain. And why wash it with water when you can just tap/brush the excess hair off of it, having removed the blades? Use it like a normal beard trimmer, and you&#x27;ll be very satisfied.</li>
            <li> This is a very well designed piece of equipment.  The selling points for me are the sturdy and substantial charging cradle which is perfect for storage, the ergonomic design and the waterproofing.  This is a very good buy in terms of value received.  The dial is legible, the movements are smooth, it is quiet, easy to clean and the parts and pieces fit together well.  It is a grooming game changer!</li>
            <li> Really like the adjust-ability in the shave. Prefer the adjustment on this shaver over the yucky attachments that seemingly gets lost with most other shavers.</li>
            <li> pros;&lt;br /&gt;liked the full spectrum of graduated settings and the ease of selecting.&lt;br /&gt;trims well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons;&lt;br /&gt;must oil prior to each use.</li>
            <li> By far the easiest and most effective trimmer I have every used.  Two key elements that make it a 5 star review.  Cleanable with water and multi-adjustable for the five o&#x27;clock shadow look.</li>
            <li> Due to the tiredness and exhaustion of being a relatively new father; coinciding with the &amp;#34;lumbersexual&amp;#34; look in vogue right now; I&#x27;ve grown a beard. I needed a good trimmer and this one is doing a great job! I can&#x27;t vouch for how it works in the shower, or trims while wet as I have not used it in that capacity yet, but I can say that my beard always looks nicely groomed. It is nice that it is an all-in-one unit. You don&#x27;t have different sized trimmer grids laying all around. So far, so good after using for a few months.</li>
            <li> Good service, great product.</li>
            <li> Works great! The dial setting for length is perfect. I just mow my beard once a week.</li>
            <li> Still getting used to using it and determining best settings for myself BUT overall looks like a perfect answer for my needs and a highest quality product...I have always been a Panasonic fan!</li>
            <li> This is so easy to use, so many length choices and works well, a must have for anyone with a moderate beard.</li>
            <li> Best facial product I have ever invested in!</li>
            <li> Excellent choice!!! The reviews are accurate... Love it!!!</li>
            <li> Works ok. I should have listened to the reviews. Battery is horrible. When charged it works, but battery is worth a whole heck of a lot.</li>
            <li> Love the adjustable dial,  Works in the shower, wish the cutting teeth were wider takes more passes to shave my head with this trimmer than with my previous trimmer. Lightweight and can be easily cleaned. Charger is compact and a little confusing because the trimmer can fit in both ways but only charges one way.  The beard guard that comes with it comes off and on easily.</li>
            <li> Works as expected so far</li>
            <li> Easy to use. I&#x27;ve now used this about 4 times and my wife says WOW!!! Looks great. The trimmer is built solid. It doesn&#x27;t snag or grab. I Love the easy to adjust height control. They did a great job with this product.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was fast</li>
            <li> Awesome shaver.  The best.</li>
            <li> Gave to my son as gift, he loves it...</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for the this trimmer based on the review, but quickly realized it was a bad purchase. The guard doesn&#x27;t come off easily. I feel like I&#x27;m breaking it every time. In fairness, it hasn&#x27;t broken yet, but I won&#x27;t be surprised when it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The longest setting is 10mm. I tend to keep my beard longer than in the winter, but this trimmer doesn&#x27;t allow for it. I&#x27;m not exactly sure you could call the trim at 5mm a beard. It&#x27;s more like 3 day stubble. Not that there is anything wrong with that, but I can&#x27;t be the only person that wants to look like I have a beard intentionally, not out of laziness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro is that the battery life is great. I can go 10 or more trims without charging it. It does ok as a body trimmer.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this trimmer out once my braun cruzer broke (self induced).  This trimmer is okay but it doesn&#x27;t feel right in my hand.  It is thin and lightweight but I prefer something a little more substantial.  Just my own preference.  I like the selectable trim heights and going to the 1/2 MM resolution is great.  I use my trimmer in the shower and this one has performed well.</li>
            <li> Motor didn&#x27;t seem too strong. Liked the shape and adjustability. Waterproof and in the shower is awesome</li>
            <li> on whether to allow myself to afford this and I am so glad I did. I use it mainly to tame body hair and keep my beard trim. It works great in and out of the shower and the single adjustable guide is genius. It takes the place of having a bunch of loose guides. I threw them all away - good space saver.</li>
            <li> My only disappointment with this product is that the charger light does not extinguish once charging is completed otherwise it is a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> Great trimmer for the price.</li>
            <li> Maybe I am expecting too much from a beard trimmer, but I feel like this product&#x27;s performance is sub-par. I had previously used a Wahl professional-style corded hair trimmer to trim my beard, so I freely admit this could be coloring my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Good:&lt;br /&gt;Ergonomic feel, easy to use at varying angles and with either hand.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to change length settings by convenient rotary dial.&lt;br /&gt;Head shape makes it relatively easy to trim tricky areas of face (ie. mustache under nose), though I have not yet encountered a design that would perfectly achieve this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad:&lt;br /&gt;Feels underpowered--I have a fairly coarse beard and mustache and it takes many passes to even out my beard, and I still touch up with scissors after spending a solid 10-15 minutes using the trimmer. As well, there is often hair-pulling when detailing without the blade guard.&lt;br /&gt;Everyone mentions it, but long charge time (20 hrs).&lt;br /&gt;Poor attachment system for blade guard. Attached by two very thin pieces of plastic that snap into unit, and I am just waiting for them to break.&lt;br /&gt;Only goes up to 10mm length setting (about the same as a #3 clipper guard). Fortunately for me, this is the length I typically trim my beard, but does not allow for me to keep my beard neat if I want to go a little more mountain man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it is a convenient solution for the money, but I really do not love it.</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas gift for my son. I believe that he was well pleased with the trimmer.</li>
            <li> seems like a good beard trimmer, cuts easily, its water proof, easy to adjust.  I only with it adjusted longer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had several shavers by various manufacturers, and this has been the best so far. It continues to cut smoothly after about a year of use, where some others I&#x27;ve had started pulling whiskers as the blades blunted. It is easy to clean and oil, and easy to adjust, though I have to say that I&#x27;ve done very little in the way of maintenance. I&#x27;ve traveled with it for up to a week without the charger, using it for a very short time every day, so it seems to hold an adequate charge for my needs.</li>
            <li> Works great. Love it.&lt;br /&gt;Also paid 1/2 as much as the price that I saw in a fancy shaving store</li>
            <li> Works awesome except after 6 months the wings of the clipper height adjust have cracked and it no longer holds itself in the device. It has a very odd removal and reinstallation of the guard leading this to happen. Plenty of height adjustment though. I will buy a different one next time but this one was the right price and had a lot of adjustment notches which is nice.</li>
            <li> guard broke after the third use.</li>
            <li> This thing is awesome!  I, unfortunately was not blessed with a golden ratio face.  I have curves where there should be lines and vice-versa.  I have gone through a few other trimmers with a kind of &amp;#34;meh&amp;#34; response.  Because my face is not quite GQ material, I always end up getting a pretty uncomfortable trim from all of those I have tried.  I&#x27;m also pretty certain that I have some affliction that causes, random, nasty in-grown hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This beast mowed down a 4 week old &amp;#34;I-don&#x27;t-want-to-shave-because-owwies-will-happen-beard&amp;#34;, with the greatest of ease.  Put that one through your spell-checker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At any rate, it was the smoothest, most painless trim I have ever had.  I am genuinely impressed with this trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10/10, would buy again.</li>
            <li> I like my old one but it died.. this is ok but not really fast you have to take your time but it does do a good job</li>
            <li> My lord, does this thing suck at cutting. I have to pass it over the same spots many, many times. Often left with a much more ragged shave than my previous shaver. The build quality is great and it feels hefty, but this is officially 40 dollars of mistake.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks and it&#x27;s great.  Haven&#x27;t had to recharge it yet and holds up well in the shower.  This was a major upgrade over my old trimmer.</li>
            <li> Not really feeling this clipper,it works better when my goatee is wet then dry. No matter how much oil I put on the blade,it seems to pinch a hair or two. Dont get a razor straight line when trimming  my moustache,my old Norelco was much better,wish they still made it.</li>
            <li> Does not cut evenly. Have to go over the same area and it still leaves patches. My old Panasonic trimmer was much better. Wish I could return this but I don&#x27;t have the packaging anymore.</li>
            <li> Very good, precise trimmer, and I can take the guard off completely for trimming my head hair if I don&#x27;t feel like using a razor on it (I normally shave my head completely). I got sick of my old trimmers with the 10+ attachments, half of which I never used, and they just fell on the floor all the time. I really just wanted a single-piece adjustable trimmer, and this has been the best one in this price range so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One negative- it has just a NiMH battery instead of a more modern lithium battery.</li>
            <li> Good product, I-m very happy with it</li>
            <li> Awesome I just love it</li>
            <li> I tried so many other ones with no luck. I trimmed my armpits, chest hair, back hair and my bear with ease. The best trimmer out there. Two-thumbs up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worked fine as a shaver. I&#x27;m a bit worried about continued use, as I&#x27;m not too thorough with the whole oiling thing, but it hasn&#x27;t fallen apart on me yet. The instructions make it sound pretty high-maintenance, we&#x27;ll see how it goes.</li>
            <li> This product is working good so far. I will put a new review after having the product a couple of months.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband and he says it is comfortable to use and trims his beard accurately.  Much better than the cheaper Norelco he&#x27;s been using.  Note: This item is selling for $69 right now on Amazon, but you can get it for $20 less both online and in stores.</li>
            <li> Nice product for beard trimming.  Easy to use although I have to remind myself which way to use hold it to make sure I trim accurately.  Not really impressed with its tight trimming capability because you still need a razor to finish off but overall I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
            <li> Its ok. It holds a charge good for body not really good for face or precision. I use in shower and at sink.</li>
            <li> I really like this trimmer.  It holds a charge for a long time and cuts consistently.  The only con I have is what others have stated about difficulty with longer hair.  In order to trim down longer hair consistently you have to start at a much higher height and work your way down which is a waste of time.</li>
            <li> This trimmer did not work well for me.  I use an electric for my beard and head, w/o a guard and I found this one missed spots and just gave an inconsistent cut.  If you like to keep your hair short and don&#x27;t use a guard, I&#x27;d look elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver feels very well made and the wet / dry feature is nice.  I think if you stick to using the adjustable guard, you might be happy with this Panasonic.</li>
            <li> Best electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever used. I was looking for something that would trim and maintain my 5&#x27;o clock shadow and it works great. Oiling and cleaning are very easy and hardly takes any time. Would highly recommend if your in the market for an electric trimmer.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- extremely silent (I&#x27;ve had 2 Norelcos before only to learn that these trimmers can be silent after purchased the Panasonic)&lt;br /&gt;- stylish (actually the charging base slightly resembles a vagina to me... lol)&lt;br /&gt;- infinite beard size adjustments (it cuts beard in the size you want, in fact the increments are so tiny that you can barely notice the difference between them)&lt;br /&gt;- can be washed in the sink for increased hygiene&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- does not come with a travel bag&lt;br /&gt;- power cord cannot be separated from charging base (no way you can pack it for travel without taking a huge space in your bag)&lt;br /&gt;- no movable head (you have to guess the angle correct, otherwise you&#x27;ll end up with uneven beard sizes through your face. The Norelcos I had before had a small spring that automatically adjusted the &#x27;attack angle&#x27;)&lt;br /&gt;- has to be oiled before and after use, every single time</li>
            <li> Very nice product. Love the .5mm adjustments, I use it to trim my beard and have pretty sensitive skin. It works without fuss and leaves my skin with no irritation.</li>
            <li> I have completed stop shaving because of this. It works very decently especially for the price! While you may be able to get a better one, this unit certainly gives you a huge bang for your buck.</li>
            <li> This is a bit crap. It doesn&#x27;t really cut my beard consistently. Look for alternative.</li>
            <li> A gift for my grandson.. He uses it everyday.. Only thing, it is a little narrow across the cutting area.. I believe the purchase is a good one.. He is the one using it daily and hasn&#x27;t complained..</li>
            <li> Product is strictly for trim of a short beard only. All the multiple setting suggest it is more versatile than it really is. Unless you wear a stuble type beard you dont want this.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for quite awhile now and it does a great job keeping my close cut beard neat and clean</li>
            <li> A bit on the heavy side! But stable cuts so its really nice! :)</li>
            <li> Very nice. Hard to find adjustable trimmers at a decent price</li>
            <li> This is the worst investment I have ever made in shavers/trimmers.  The blades seem to run too slow, and it feels like an uneven trim when finished.  Without the guard, the blades constantly pull at your hair.  Don&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> My husband has issues with his skin that making shaving not so fun. The one cordless shaver he had broke and he spend a great deal of time trying to find a new one. We received this one and he loves it.. it is quick and doesn&#x27;t irritate his skin.</li>
            <li> Works great for trimming my facial hair, great deal in my opinion.</li>
            <li> So far so good, just have to see how long it holds up. Only use it once a week.</li>
            <li> my husband has been using this for a year now and he loves it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this clipper on my face, head, back, and a few other places. It is working well for me. The fact that it is cordless is a huge advantage. It is also light weight and comfortable to hold. The adjustable comb works exactly as it should: it determines how close to the skin the clipper will clip. Panasonic designed this clipper to be waterproof. Waterproof is good, if only for ease in cleaning. I really would not want to clean this thing out with brushes and compressed air. Battery life is very good. I was not able to drain the battery in my testing. More on that later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are a few things to consider about this clipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not as effective in cutting hair (on top of your head, I mean) as a dedicated barber&#x27;s clipper. The blade is too small for this application. I am using it to style my hair anyway. It saves me time and money versus going to visit a barber.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no way to tell how much charge is in the battery of the clipper. For this reason, it is convenient to keep the clipper fully charged, all of the time. From experience, I can tell you that this practice will shorten the life of the rechargeable battery. I believe that the battery life on this clipper is very good. I was not able to drain the battery in my testing. Without an indication of battery charge, such testing would be inconvenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No carrying case is provided. That&#x27;s too bad, because it won&#x27;t be easy to improvise one. A Ziploc bag, maybe. A real shame, because the clipper is small enough to travel with you. That&#x27;s one of its advantages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instruction manual advises that the clipper should be lubricated after each use. A tiny bottle of clipper oil is included for that purpose. This is inconvenient, but barber&#x27;s clippers are supposed to be oiled up frequently as well. The oilable part of the Panasonic clipper snaps out easily. As long as Panasonic will sell replacements, the situation is not too bad. I don&#x27;t plan to oil up my clipper frequently, so I expect the oilable part of the clipper to get dull or fall apart eventually. That&#x27;s my choice, I&#x27;m lazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t consider any of these complaints to be serious. I like this clipper. I found new jobs for it after I started using it. For what you get, the price is very attractive.my clipper frequently, so I expect the oilable part of the clipper to get dull or fall apart eventually.

For what you get, the price is very attractive.</li>
            <li> This thing is small but excellent, worth the money. Great portability. The only knock on it is that you must oil it.</li>
            <li> Good value for the money</li>
            <li> Replaced an older trimmer and now realize how bad it was.....even when it was new when compared to this one. Great for the price.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t trim very evenly and takes way longer than my Oster ever did. That was frustrating but I tolerated it... until the battery completely died on me 6 months after buying it! It died in the middle of me trimming my beard before work after vacation- hilarious but it really is just a piss poor shaver. Lots of people have posted about the battery issues and while I know there are lots of positive reviews, I strongly rec that everyone take the battery issues seriously.</li>
            <li> as advertised, quick charge and works great!</li>
            <li> So far it has done a good job.</li>
            <li> Purchased this shaver in January of 2014. The multiple settings are useful, but the battery was surprisingly weak. The charger died in late July 2014. Panasonic asked me to pay to ship it to Texas for repairs, which would have taken several weeks (including shipping both ways). Completely unsatisfactory. Won&#x27;t be purchasing this product again.</li>
            <li> Trimmer works well, like the dial-a-length adjustment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery takes 19 hours to charge. If they would update this product with a modern Li cell, would be 5 stars.</li>
            <li> It works alright. The day long charge time is a bit out there. The guard cracked while trying to remove it after a few uses. Still works just falls out if it&#x27;s upside-down.</li>
            <li> Works great&lt;br /&gt;Still not certain where to oil w daily use!</li>
            <li> Do Not buy this trimmer it&#x27;s terrible only works when it wants.When you need it to trim Forget About It!</li>
            <li> Incredible product, I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Very quiet, does what it&#x27;s supposed to.  I use it in shower also, no functionality issues.  I love the adjustable head, so much easier than my Wahl I used to use with the multiple trimmer attachments.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This beard trimmer is even better than I expected. Easy to use, easy to clean and nice crisp trim. I really like the simplicity of the trim height selector. I couldn&#x27;t have made a better purchase.</li>
            <li> very sharp and easy on the face, not irritating. I love the adjustment for best results on the shave. It&#x27;s my favorite</li>
            <li> It has very great precision while trimming...I like the mm scale to select the length. It does not make much noise and is very smooth on the skin</li>
            <li> This trimmer can be used in the shower, which might be a plus for some, but the main plus for me is that it does what it is supposed to.  It trims precisely, holds a charge and does not pull hairs when cutting. If there are durability issues, I will re-post, but for now, there are no down sides to this trimmer. Comfortable and easy to use.  I definitely recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the best,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jay</li>
            <li> Lots of settings, works well, easy to clean, long battery life. My only quibble is its somewhat cheap feel. I have another Panasonic razor and it felt the same new last year and now has battery issues and seems ready to fall apart, so I fear the same for this unit. But I guess I&#x27;m kidding myself that any of this made in crapland stuff is built to last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even the once mighty Braun now makes stuff that feels like this, so I guess real solid build quality just doesn&#x27;t provide the repeat business of products designed to last a few years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hey, they tell me to be as honest as possible on these Vine reviews, so there it is. I hope it helps some folks reconsider getting what you pay for...including all the manufacturers of the 21st century&#x27;s could-last-if they-weren&#x27;t-built-to-be-disposable products.</li>
            <li> After owning several trimmers including Wahl and Philips, I decided to give this Panasonic a go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the things I could not stand with the other trimmers is keeping up with all of those dang hair guards.  Grab this one for this area and then remove it, put the other one for that... etc, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This trimmer completely solves that with its ingenious &#x27;dial a length&#x27; (my fancy technical term) built in guard.  With a simple turn, you can go from minimum to maximum length.  Why didn&#x27;t anyone think of that before?  Talk about de-clutter.  I love it.  I&#x27;ve not used this with shaving cream, but I have rinsed it and it was very nice to not worry about water messing it up.  It cuts hair easily and goes quite a while on one charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the stand --except for one detail-- as it allows for one-handed stowage and removal.  Sweet!  The one thing I did not like about the stand is that is has this red light that comes on to indicate it is charging.  However, it never turns off.  It stays red all of the time.  I would think that it would blink during charging or simply turn off after it&#x27;s fully charged.  Otherwise, you can&#x27;t tell when it is fully charged.  That&#x27;s not a huge deal as all of the other benefits make up for it by far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY recommended!</li>
            <li> Another great product from Panasonic! I&#x27;ve never been disappointed by any Panasonic product from my fist little mono cassette deck to this great trimmer. I use it to trim neck hair mostly. It has so many setting which makes it very versatile. My wife has even used it to trim my hair between visits to the barber shop. The trimmer is very easy to use, very ergonomic like their shavers which I have been partial to for years. Love the Panasonic wet/dry shavers. This is a very versatile, high quality trimmer that I have no problem giving the highest recommendation. You won&#x27;t find a better one at this price.</li>
            <li> Cuts nicely.  Comfortable in the hand.  I doubt I will oil it as often as they recommend so hopefully I won&#x27;t have to replace it too soon.</li>
            <li> This unit does not hold a charge, whether I keep it in it&#x27;s charger or charge it up and then use it. I can not finish grooming before the battery starts to die.  And forget any type of close shave, I was better off with the generic CVS brand one to get more options for closer shave.  I had to return this, not at all worth the money!!</li>
            <li> The manual says to oil it after each use and shows you how to remove the blade assembly.  However I nearly dislocated my thumb trying to slide this off and it still won&#x27;t come off.  I&#x27;ll just use it quits working then throw it away.  Will try another product after that.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a wonderful and handy tool for men who want to look great. I like the fact that you can adjust to your needs and trim your hair or beard at home. Very good precision blades, and easy to clean and maintain.</li>
            <li> This shaver is really great. Works perfectly in the shower and it cleans easily. Charging is quick and it holds a charge for a long time. Love it.</li>
            <li> excelent quality item, great price.</li>
            <li> great trimmer. bought it to replace my noreclo after it finally died! love the rechargable aspect. holds a charge for a long time. trims evenly. great for use in the shower too!</li>
            <li> good product, recommended to my friend</li>
            <li> Was a gift--good product, easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Writing this at least a year after buying the trimmer. Husband loves this replacement, bought to replace a dead unit. Does everything it promised, effectively.  Changing trim length is super easy with the dial. Only negative is lack of a &amp;#34;charged/needs recharge&amp;#34; light. It has a light but it&#x27;s either lit (charging) or not lit. It doesn&#x27;t indicate actual charge level of the unit. However, this hasn&#x27;t been a big issue since the battery lasts a very long time off a charge and it usually just gets left plugged in all the time.</li>
            <li> Product sucks. Can&#x27;t remove guard, will not cut short hairs easily. Wiuld not recommend. Had a $15 Whal that was better.</li>
            <li> Love this - works well, I mean really well.</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband and I thoroughly read the reviews before I purchased it. He likes to maintain a goatee so I knew the size of this would be perfect. I was right! He said it was easy to use, very comfortable and super easy to clean. I love the color personally and would buy this for my brother if he didn&#x27;t already have one!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s every thing you have dreamed for</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!!! Barely cuts my beard, requires multiple passes, clogs in one pass even though it missed so much. REQUIRES water to even work at all. LAME.</li>
            <li> The features are nice. I wish it had more power to cut through my beard faster. Battery is holding up well.</li>
            <li> I have only good things to say about it. It feels great, looks awesome, trims well and is easy to clean. It has a very ergonomic design which fits great in your hand and the blue part has a rubbery texture to it.</li>
            <li> Does a nice job overall. Good ergonomics, easy recharging, and not hard to keep clean. Overall, performs as advertised. I think it is the best product of this type out there.</li>
            <li> Well this unit in the description claimed to have all this power... It seems anemic and very low on power.  Additionally, I hate these trimmer units that require some sort of a charging base to charge the thing.  I guess they figure you never travel, or if you do, it will last weeks on a single charge.  They should have spent more time and money on functionality and REAL power versus making it look pretty.</li>
            <li> I have had many trimmers in the past, but this one is really nice. No slipping of shaving guide head where you have different depths of trimming; here you just set and go! Great grip, feels good in the hand! Long charging life... no having to plug it in half war through your trimming. It also can handle a tough beard with no problem! I would recommend this to anyone who has a beard and likes to keep it trimmed nice... awesome trimmer! Surprised Panasonic did not slip a mini-radio in the handle???!!!</li>
            <li> I email Panasonic and asked them if I could re-charge the battery in Europe if I purchased the ER-GB40-S here in the States their answer was&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &amp;#34; We recommend that you purchase the unit in the country you resides. Units that are manufactured for U.S.A, works best with U.S.A power supply. &amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you are planning travel overseas from Europe ,Asia, Africa  or the America&#x27;s  DO NOT plan on using the ER-GB40-S away from your Country of purchase according to the email I received from Panasonic</li>
            <li> Is a good item my husband love it he used it all the time my husband  love. It . .</li>
            <li> Finally got my beard and mustache trimmed and shaped up after my longtime Wahl trimmer died. Yippeeeee!!!!&lt;br /&gt;New Panasonic trimmer is easy to use and clean. Holds a charge for a long time, but takes to long to charge up if needed quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Seems to be built well and hope it holds up for many years. So Far So Good.</li>
            <li> This is a terrible product that pulls your hair. Causes bald spots, and now alltogether stopped charging in the cradle....garbage time</li>
            <li> A great trimmer for the shower, where all the hair goes down the drain instead of over the bathroom floor.  I&#x27;ve used many different brands of low cost trimmers.  This lets me do my head and face to a Number#1 all over in five minutes - even if I have let things get a bit wild.  The only thing to detract is the manual says you have to oil the cutter and the mechanism underneath each time you use it - I&#x27;ll live with that.  Because of my success with this I have now ordered the big brother (Panasonic ER-GS60-S Self-Hair Clipper Wet/Dry).</li>
            <li> This was a gift but the recipient loved it.  Said it performed as advertised and would definately recommend this item</li>
            <li> This design works brilliantly. Love that all you have to do is turn to increase or decrease the height. Works very well. The waterproof aspect is a big bonus too.</li>
            <li> Yes buy it, don&#x27;t just sit there.  The best trimmer I have ever owned and looks like I will not have to replace it anytime soon</li>
            <li> I know. Most people think of Remington when they think of electric shavers and trimmers, but I have to say this Panasonic was quite pleasing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Construction: Solid. Feels like it was made with care, using decent parts. The water-flow maintenance hole is pretty cool. Handles wet or dry without a hitch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cutting &amp; Closeness: As close as any competition. Cuts whiskers effectively. Little or no pulling. Having so many different settings makes it more versatile than most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sound: Yes, this matters. The trimmer is quieter than many I&#x27;ve used, but still makes quite a bit of noise. You won&#x27;t be using this in close quarters while someone else is sleeping if you want to maintain a friendly relationship.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Power: This charges on a stand and operates without a cord. That&#x27;s exceptionally handy-- Especially for a wet/dry trimmer! It holds a charge for a long time, and the stand is really convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look: Slick-looking! Not your usual boring black device. Cleans up easily so it doesn&#x27;t look like a smudged mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final Verdict:  Five Stars. There&#x27;s nothing to dislike here. It works wonderfully and gets the job done with efficiency and style. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving my head for 16 years and this is so far the best product I&#x27;ve used. Also works great for trimming body hair. Super user friendly and a cinch to clean and lube. Would recommend for anyone who likes to keep trim and clean.</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S OK, NOTHING SPECIAL. I EXPECTED MORE FOR THE PRICE. IT IS OVER-PRICED. SHOULD BE 25-30 DOLLARS.&lt;br /&gt;DOESN&#x27;T CUT ANY BETTER THAT SIMILAR PRODUCTS AT HALF THE PRICE .</li>
            <li> Light but feels solid.&lt;br /&gt;Adjustable length is a big plus. Cuts very well head hair but have not used it on facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;Charge is more than enough for a trim. You do not need to worry about multiple attachments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give it 5 stars if it were not for the frequent lubrication requirement.</li>
            <li> My first beard trimmer. It works great and the charge lasts a long time for my use. Easy to clean and looks good too sitting on the sink.</li>
            <li> According to the packaging, a bottle of oil was supposed to be included.  In reading the directions you need to oil the blades before and after each use.  I checked on line and all resellers of the oil had the product backordered.  I called Panasonic and they also had the oil back ordered, for 3 – 6 weeks.  So as of right now I’m waiting for the oil to arrive before I can use the product.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not great. You can get a similar shave from a way cheaper device. Who is this for? I don&#x27;t know, because it shaves OK, as does every other product I try. It&#x27;s perhaps my fault, but they all seem to do about the same thing. This one is great, because you don&#x27;t need to keep track of any guards, so you just dial it in, 1mm/6mm/1cm but it&#x27;s really just better to go find a barber who&#x27;ll do it well and inexpensively.</li>
            <li> bought this after my Philips QT4050 broke from fall down a flight of stairs.  I found this on sale at Future Shop and decided to get this over the another 4050.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would rate this 2.5 out of 5, but Amazon doesn&#x27;t allow that, and I think it is closure to a 3 then a 2.  For every positive this razor has a negative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the charging stand goes, if you are someone that likes to keep things on top of your counter this is possibly the nicest looking trimmer and stand on the market.  I personally don&#x27;t, after it&#x27;s finished charging I place it in the drawer, but if looks are important, this trimmer gets a 5 in the department.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charging stand does have a negative.  The light on the stand only indicates that charger is actually on the stand correctly.  The light on the stand will either be on, meaning the trimmer is on the stand, or the light will be off.  The light is only red, it will not change colors when it is done charging, nor will it turn off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When fully charged this has an incredible battery life, however the trimmer does not have any indicator to let you know when the battery is dying or how much life you have left.  This is a huge negative, since this trimmer can only be used as a cordless.  There is no option to use a cord, the trimmer can only be charged by sitting on the stand.  If the trimmer starts to die before you are finished, you are out of luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The motor on this is very quite.  It is easily the quickest one I&#x27;ve every owned.  However, that benefit is probably achieved by under powering the motor.  I found the 4050 to have a little more power, which means the 4070 which is also cheaper then this, may have a lot more power then this.  I found myself having to do some extra passes with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest benefit of this trimmer is probably the fact that you can use it in the shower, and clean it by running water through it.  The draw back is the maintenance that is required because ofthis.  In a time when more and more trimmers are becoming Maintenance-free, this trimmer requires you to oil it&#x27;s blades both before and after each use.  With that said, I still find it faster to wash this under water and apply 3 drops of oil, then have to clean the trimmer with a brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually like the comb, it feels fine against my face and doesn&#x27;t scratch.  However taking it off does feel odd sometimes, and sometimes it does feel like you have to force it off and it might break.  With that said the trimmer does feel like it is solidly made, so maybe it&#x27;s something I&#x27;ll get us to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the price.  I do think this is overpriced.  I live in Toronto, Canada.  At Future Shop this was priced regularly at $69, the Philips 4050 was at $49 and the 4070 at 64.  I got it on sale for 59.  I would not buy this for regular price, and honestly if I had to replace it, I wouldn&#x27;t spend $59 on again either.  This shouldn&#x27;t be price more then Philips 4050 at $49.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, like I mentioned at the top, this is a decent trimmer, but is nothing to write home about, and it is very overpriced.  It has some nice benefits, but also some huge negatives.  It does the job, but there are trimmer that do just as good of a job at a lot cheaper price.</li>
            <li> Every feature is as described. Higher quality than the price would suggest. Very quiet, the charging cradle doesn&#x27;t take up too much room in my small bathroom, and the submersible and washable design is just way too cool. I have a feeling this one is going to last a while, so I&#x27;m glad I am not spending that while with a poorly designed, dysfunctional piece of shi...  Er, equipment.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected</li>
            <li> Sometimes pulls hair - blades not sharp enough?  Guard feels fragile when removing it. Well finished. Unusually nice recharging recharging stand and height adjustment dial.</li>
            <li> Good quality and perfect design but just for beard shaving. you must take care of the blade and the charger as they are not cheap to replace.</li>
            <li> Here is the bottom line on this trimmer for me - it works very quickly and leaves me with a trim and neat beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most important things that I wanted in a beard trimmer was something that would be quiet, work quickly and evenly, and clean up easily.  This trimmer hits a home run on each of these things.  My beard is multi-grained, pushing in several different directions, but I get an even trim every time with just a minute or two of work.  Cleaning it up couldn&#x27;t be easier, just run the whole thing under water.  When I&#x27;m done, it sits on an attractive charging stand.  I kept it plugged in for the first few days, but then I decided to see how long the battery will last on its own.  It&#x27;s been a little over a week, and it still seems fully charged, which is good news for taking it on trips!  And the noise... well, there almost isn&#x27;t any noise at all while you&#x27;re trimming!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have a couple of small complaints.  First of all, while you don&#x27;t have to worry about sharpening the blade, the instructions say you should oil it before and after each use.  It took me a little bit to figure out exactly how to do that, because the instructions were unclear.  It turns out that you just pop off the razor and squeeze a drop of oil onto the two coils and the one razor.  Problem solved, although I irrationally find it annoying to take fifteen seconds to oil it after every use.  However, I do have a problem with the comb on top of the trimmer.  It is really difficult to get off, and in just two weeks I think that I&#x27;ve already broken the pieces that hold the comb down.  On the other hand, now the comb slides off easily but still stays put while I&#x27;m trimming, so this hasn&#x27;t been an issue so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a great product.  Because I&#x27;ve never used a different beard trimmer I can&#x27;t speak to whether another trimmer might be just as good for less money, but I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> My previous trimmer was a $15 Con Air corded trimmer that I used for about 6 years before deciding I wanted to go cordless. So I&#x27;m not exactly a trimmer snob.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First I&#x27;ll start with the good: I love that it is cordless and has an integrated adjustable head. It is also is quiet and doesn&#x27;t shoot hair bits all over the place while trimming and I like that I don&#x27;t have to worry about running water all over it. But who really cares about all of that if it doesn&#x27;t work worth a crap. It takes 3-4x as long to trim my beard than the Conair does. It just has a really hard time trimming all of the hairs, so it takes going back over and over trying to get the stragglers cut evenly. I was extremely disappointed right out of the box and it hasn&#x27;t got any better. I don&#x27;t know of its a power issue or if the head design is just not as effective, but the performance is seriously sub par. I really hope there is something better out there with similar features and I don&#x27;t have to buy 3 or 4 trimmers before I find it.</li>
            <li> Shaves well, just didn&#x27;t last very long on my experience. No warranty, poor form.</li>
            <li> This is the best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever had. It&#x27;s quiet, fast and accurate. One swipe is all it takes to trim correctly, no more raking the trimmer back and forth to get a good trim. Looks cool and holds a charge for weeks. The adjustable wheel is cool but takes some getting used to, I trimmed my beard way too short the first time. Err on the side of caution until you get used to the settings. Great trimmer, very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> For a product that has such a good design and fine adjustment features, this completely fails in three ways. The motor is really weak and it takes almost three times longer to trim my beard than with my previous trimmer that was battery operated. The fact that the Panasonic can be charged and doesn&#x27;t need batteries is of no value when you consider the weak motor, the very long  time needed to recharge the battery, and no indicator to tell you when it needs to be recharged. The frustration really sets in when an already weak motor becomes even weaker with a run-down battery and you discover this while in the process of trimming moustache and beard.</li>
            <li> There is little to dislike in these trimmers.  They are easy to use, easy to adjust, and easy to clean.  The ease was even misleading to the point that we gave them a try in a full haircut.  As a haircutting tool it was a little tedious but it did work despite taking some extra time.  As beard and sideburn trimmers they are outstanding.  The dial adjust feature is particularly nice and easier than some other trimmers that have to be pushed either direction to adjust.  The wet/dry design makes them safe to use on wet hair and make them easy to clean.</li>
            <li> This works pretty good and I like the docking station that it provides for storage and charging.  The guard is easy to adjust, stays put, and seems accurate.  I also love that it&#x27;s water proof and can be rinsed out easily from beard trimmings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downside is that without the guard, the teeth catch hair too often.  I think the power is a little lacking and that could be a cause of catching hair as well.  It also requires regular oiling, especially if you are rinsing through water regularly.</li>
            <li> We got this because my boyfriend cuts his own hair and he needed a new hair shaver. The description of this item says \\&quot;all-in-one hair and beard\\&quot; so we were thinking that he would be able to trim his head with this. He is unable to do so because the surface that trims the hair is too small.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, on the positive side, this is great for men who have facial hair. This will not give you a completely smooth shave, but it will keep your facial hair neat and trimmed. I love that it is able to be used in the shower. That has been a big help and cuts down on the mess that is left behind after shaving in the sink. It is very easy to adjust and I really like that it is chargeable so there are no annoying cords to deal with.</li>
            <li> I read a lot of reviews before buying this.  I can&#x27;t speak to any other trimmers, but my son, whose beard can get very bushy but looks much better when it&#x27;s neatly trimmed, loves this trimmer.  He just went back to college and took this with him, and left his old electric razor here.  Isn&#x27;t that all you really need to know?  I hope it holds up well, but now I have to get another one for my husband!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband for Christmas and he absolutely LOVES this. It is a clean cut and very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! Does tremendous work and very compact and comfortable , overall very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned Wahl, Phillips, Gillette and another Panasonic personal groomer (that one lasted 11 years!) so was anxious to &amp;#34;upgrade&amp;#34; as it was time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 2 weeks of use, I&#x27;m thoroughly impressed.</li>
            <li> Does the trick (at 5mm) at a reasonable price. Love the fact it can get wet.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any problems with this yet, and I have had it for a year.</li>
            <li> Works great. It cuts nice and even, no pulling of hairs. I will say if you want to have a bit longer of a trim, it is probably not the best trimmer for you. It works great for my side burns and for trimming the good ol eyebrows. Easy to clean and it&#x27;s quiet too. Glad I bought it. Great for keeping the facial hair tight and clean.</li>
            <li> Works in the shower and holds a charge for a month</li>
            <li> I use this to shave my scalp/head every other day and it works great. I no longer use razors to shave because the ER-GB40-S give me a shave equivalent to using a razor and I don&#x27;t get bumps on my head. I recommend it for anyone who has to shave their head frequently.</li>
            <li> almost perfect. I need a transformer to use it in European country.</li>
            <li> This beard trimmer works exactly as it should and as I thought it would. It is water proof/resistant but I use it in the shower all the time. I would recommend it to anyone that was in the market for a device like this.</li>
            <li> I used to own the Wahl 9854-600 Lithium Ion All-in-One trimmer and they were great!  The adjustable comb broke on me, one of the teeth that securely fastens the comb to the blade did anyway, and trying to use it after that was just a fumble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had no complaints about the Wahls--they performed their job effectively, however--I didn&#x27;t know that there were such superior trimmers out there.  I owned a different beard trimmer, before the Wahl model--can&#x27;t recall which but they performed similarly although the Wahls did outperform those, not by much though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I couldn&#x27;t find an adjustable comb replacement, no information about any particular part number or the like (which Panasonic intuitively addresses this by providing replacement part numbers for nearly all the major components of the Milano trimmer in their documentation).  And instead of experimenting with different adjustable combs that might fit--I just decided to get a new beard trimmer, but not before doing a bit of research.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s when I came across this model and read lots of reviews about how only 1-2 passes are needed for an even trim.  This was no exaggeration and the Wahls usually required a few passes and inevitably some hair would be pulled because of the large spaces between the stifled blade teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could tell instantly, out of the box--before use, that the blade with the Milano model was quality because of the very short separation between teeth and the short length of the blade teeth.  This reduces the opportunity for pinched hair for folks with particularly coarse facial hair, although I don&#x27;t know many people with fine facial hair--so this might be a completely negligible consideration for most but the final point is that this trimmer will be less-likely to pinch hair and more apt to provide an even trim with fewer passes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really in love with this, I appreciate the stand, that&#x27;s purely aesthetically-pleasing though.  I enjoy the ease of cleaning, though never really a chore--Panasonic made it even simpler to clean.  Everything about this just speaks in terms of quality.  The adjustable comb would be quite difficult to break without some considerable mishandling or a lofty drop (unless stored with the comb in its most extended length--not recommended obviously).  The adjustability is quite fine tuned, in increments of .5mm (wow!).  And I just can&#x27;t describe what it&#x27;s like going from the retrospectively coarse trimming of the Wahl&#x27;s to this fine trimming machine.  There&#x27;s an actual funnel where you run running water to get under the blade for easy cleaning, then you disassemble for sufficient aerating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah, this I guess, is what it must have felt like to go from black &amp; white to color, nothing wrong with black &amp; white, it entertains just like its color counterpart but the presentation is a different beast altogether.  Good job Panasonic!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth every bit of the $45-dollar pricetag (got it from drugstore.com since amazon wouldn&#x27;t ship to my APO).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t imagine going to another beard trimmer now, without equal or superior performance.  My beard is just gonna be grateful for this smooth, trimming experience.cleaning, though never really a chore--Panasonic made it even simpler to clean.

            <li> meets expectations&lt;br /&gt;would recommend it</li>
            <li> The only problem I have yet to encounter with this is the small shaving head.  This is just more of a slight inconvenience than anything.  Good power and easily adjustable.  I love the charging dock that comes with it, very convenient.</li>
            <li> The adjustable head is fantastic, and the fact that you can wash it is incredible. Some things to be wary of: the measurements (mm) don&#x27;t correspond very well to other devices, so go for MUCH longer and work your way in. Also, it takes many passes to get all hair to an even length, which can be tedious. Remember to oil it very frequently or the motor will whine at you.</li>
            <li> Feels very solid. Went a week without trimming and it had the power to cut without missing hairs. So far, it feels like the best beard trimmer I&#x27;ve ever owned.    The only concern I have is the use of a charging stand rather than just a cable. When the battery starts to age, I won&#x27;t be able to stretch the use of the device by using it while it is plugged in. However, if it works this well for a year or two, I will happily just buy another unit.</li>
            <li> I like the product but be warned, if you plan on traveling outside North America with this do plug the charger into a 220 volt outlet.  The charger is for 110 volts only.  Within 5 minutes your charger will become useless.</li>
            <li> Only used it once but it works great, hopefully it holds up, love the adjustment setting without having to change the spacer. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I didnt care for this at 1st, but, after a few tries it grew on me and it actually does an excellent job</li>
            <li> Cleaning and oiling of the shaving head is a huge hassle  and time consuming problem.  The 3rd time I opened it for cleaning and oiling, 2 tiny metal pieces that somehow hold the top  razor plate in place, popped out and fell on the counter.  I have no idea where they came from in order to insert them back.  The little manual does not show/mention them at all.&lt;br /&gt;I plan to call Panasonic but I don&#x27;t expect to get much help. The answering folks usually have no technical knowledge of the parts of products and  models.  Their default advice is to buy a new one which with shipping is more expensive than buying a new machine from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is very unfortunate because I loved it enough to bare the cleaning and oiling and actually considered to give it 4 stars instead of 5.  Instead, I give it 2  if you have the money for a good but disposable trimmer:-[ .  It could be easily corrected if the manual had detailed diagram that shows them and where they belong.</li>
            <li> High quality construction and nicely styled. This trimmer is easy to adjust and does a nice job of trimming around the edges in between haircuts. Can be used wet or dry. No problems experienced. Holds a charge for weeks at my usage level.</li>
            <li> It misses a lot of hairs but charges well and is incredibly easy to use. With enough patience you can accomplish whatever style youre going for.</li>
            <li> This is the benchmark by which all trimmers should adhere to.  I keep my hair short.  I previously tried a Remington do it yourself cutter that did the job but was time consuming.  I also bought the accessory trimmer for the Norelco 3D razor which again, did the job but lagged with power.  The Panasonic is superb.  Powerful and sharp.  As a sideburn trimmer, its unmatched in performance.  My wife cut my hair in the fraction of the time it took with these other tools.  Its a keeper.  It feels good in hand, and has several length settings in .5 increments.  It also looks great in its charging stand.  Another winner from a leader in hair maintenance products.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Well built, sturdy and cuts well. Love the size setting dial.</li>
            <li> The plastic attachment is a little bit flimsy. I use it mainly as a beard trimmer and it does a fairly good job. Still much better than a Remington it  will replace. Overall pretty good trimmer.</li>
            <li> This has got to be the best trimmer out there very easy to use and super easy to clean! I tried 4 different trimmers before this one,  also has a nice weight on it.</li>
            <li> I trim a beard and mustache regularly. The clippers are alittle narrower than my previous trimmer, and it took a few times to get used to that. The narrow clipper now gets into tighter areas around the mouth and sideburns, and really trims the mustache precisely.</li>
            <li> Purchased this unit to trim my facial hair. Works great, goes a long time without having to recharge. I love the rotating selection wheel. The trimming blade unsnaps for easy cleaning and oiling. I use it two to three times per month and have not had any issues.</li>
            <li> Superb product..recommend</li>
            <li> This trimmer is very easy to use. It is adjustable from 0&amp;#34; to 5/8&amp;#34;. What&#x27;s not to like.</li>
            <li> Works great!  Quiet.  Just had to getting my beard trimming setting right.  A #6 setting on my old Norelco is not the same as a #6 on the Panasonic. Glad I spent the extra money to buy this.</li>
            <li> I owned and used this product for several weeks now. For the price it works fantastic and the fact that it works in the shower and is waterproof is great. The adjustable length works great and is very convenient. I have noticed however that the charger light indicator stays red and does not turn to Green at any point which I can only assume means that it does not have an automatic shut off. Overall I would still recommend this to anyone  as far as Beard/hair trimmers go. I&#x27;ve gone through about four in the past two years that were cheap and among them were Remington in the norelco entry level trimmers and they were absolutely horrendously bad. Spend just a little more and get something that will last a long time and work well during that time.</li>
            <li> Wish I could take the guard off when needed</li>
            <li> The trimmer feels solid but a few things make I less than desirable to me. First it trims my beard unevenly. If I put pressure on an area it will cut it shorter than other areas. It must be the large and wide comb head that lets it get closer in the contours of your face. The second item ..and I knew this ahead of time..is the charger doesn&#x27;t tell you when it is fully charged. You need to leave the charger on the counter all the time. This isn&#x27;t very good when you travel. The shaver is not designed to work when plugged in as some are. If you allow it to die you must wait until it is charged somewhat in order to use it. These are pretty basic flaws. The good is that the trimmer settings work well and don&#x27;t slip from one setting to another as has happened with a previous trimmer. I will be looking for a replacement as I don&#x27;t like the scalped look on my chin when the other areas are a different length.</li>
            <li> This product has a very nice design but if you have a thick beard, look elsewhere such as the discontinued Panasonic ER224S All-in-One Hair Clipper &amp; Beard Wet/Dry Trimmer.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t take multi voltage disappointing product.</li>
            <li> I use this every week and it works mint!</li>
            <li> Good value and good shaver.</li>
            <li> Cordless and a nice price. Would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I had to replace a trimmer that must be 15 or more years old. The new trimmer takes a long time to charge, but holds the charge for a long time. I have used it four or five times and it still has power as if just charged. I use it once a week. It is also very quiet. For space, wish it had a plug in charger rather than a stand, a matter of taste I guess. The only problem is that I have to go over my beard a few times, it leaves hair. My old trimmer had three settings and this one has many more, so it was a little trial and error on that, but no problem at all. I am mainly happy with it and I am not sorry I bought it.</li>
            <li> I shave my head a couple times a week, with this trimmer on its lowest setting it takes the hair down to the total bald look. It works in the shower as advertised. Is very adjustable from bald to a good full beard setting. Works very good.</li>
            <li> Awesome price for the product.</li>
            <li> Being macho, I didn&#x27;t read the instructions and set the blade at 6 mm and cut my beard down too short.  It taught me that 6 mm is not #4 length on an old fashioned shaver/hair cutter. The Good part is my beard was all the same length and all of the whiskers were the same length. I finally, after 15 tears, got my mustache trimmed correctly.  Now I am on the road to having an even beard and mustache and this razor does a great job.</li>
            <li> Feels and performs like a &amp;#34;use and toss&amp;#34; item. Very unimpressed. If I could&#x27;ve rated this 0 stars I would&#x27;ve. And mostly I&#x27;d like my money back. On a good note-its quiet.</li>
            <li> Works great so far, pretty happy with it. Easy to use, feels nice</li>
            <li> This trimmer works much better for tidying up between haircuts on my son and husband that the previous trimmer I owned, which required changing attachments for each length.  Since I can dial it up or down in a second I can quickly change lengths.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, you still need a second trimmer that gives a very close shave for neatening up the edges of the hairline, it would be absolutely fantastic if it could dial down to \\&quot;zero\\&quot; rather than 1mm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rinsing clean is defiantly a plus, the instructions specifying that you have to oil it each time, a minus.  have had other</li>
            <li> This trimmer arrived right on time and after a 15 hour charge worked great. I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars because I think it&#x27;s lacking a few things. First is I wish it had a display with the battery percentage remaining. I never know when it needs charging. Another is that it&#x27;s a bit difficult getting all the mustache hairs even and the ways it&#x27;s designed can be prickly there. Everywhere else it&#x27;s great. Very quick and quiet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned the Panasonic ER224S as well as the Norelco BodyGroom, both of which are broken in some way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Panasonic ER224S was finicky to adjust and the &#x27;plastic guard&#x27; (of which there is only one) broke at the corner and would not stay on.  Tried taping it and supergluing it and got a few more uses and then threw it away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Norelco bodygroom broke in the On position.  Meaning, one night I jumped out of my bed with a racket in the bathroom, thought it was a rattlesnake!  Turns out the bodygroom shaver turned on for no reason and would not turn off.  Read some reviews on Amazon and I wasn&#x27;t the first person that happened to.  Also, changing the &#x27;plastic guards&#x27; always felt like I was going to crack one of them and or the shaver foil would pop-off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter the Panasonic ER-GB40-S&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;This is a pretty solid 4-star shaver for hair/beard/bodygrooming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dial to adjust the height of the shaving guard is leagues better than that on the ER224S.  It&#x27;s very precise and smooth to use.  The ER224S always gave you an uneasy/hope it doesn&#x27;t break type feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ergonomics is good though I do have to press the small button a couple of times to turn it on, only because that button is too dang small to fit my fingertip into.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why do I take off 1-star?&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;Of all shavers, this one really, really needs a carrying case.  When I first opened it, I saw this small grey plastic thing on the bathroom floor.  Upon closer look it was the cleaning brush.  In the cardboard holder was the cleaning oil.  This can be easily lost.  In a perfect world, they&#x27;d incorporate a holder for the brush on the device itself like you would a stylus (and it&#x27;d be self-oiling ;) )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, to charge it, it&#x27;s not a simple, plug in this cord and lay it on the counter, it&#x27;s this large plastic contraption that grips the shaver at the sides to charge it.  I have little roomin my bathroom to begin with and none of my other shavers require such a large contraption - they just have a small plug.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, the cleaning of it, which you&#x27;ll do every time you use it feels like I&#x27;m going to break it.  The plastic guard does not easily pop off, you just have to finagle with it and pull on the outer tabs or push them in until you wrestle the guard off to clean it (with the tiny cleaning brush you&#x27;ll have trouble finding again) and to oil it.  Add a one-click-pop-off button and I&#x27;d add half a star back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, I kinda wish they&#x27;d cover the millimeter height marking when viewing the shaver from the back, because you may see 10mm, but on the *front* of the shaver that means 3mm or so.  If it&#x27;s 6am and you&#x27;re half awake, you could easily make the mistake the shaver is set to 10mm when it is really at 3mm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall Summary:&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;My gripes are minor and livable.  This shaver still feels like higher quality and still far better than the Norelco BodyGroom and Panasonic ER224s.  Fix all the gripes and it will be an 5-star shaver, but for now, a solid 4-stars.</li>
            <li> Has all the features that I wanted. In particular I really like the &amp;#34;Dial a length&amp;#34; adjustment that no longer needs mounting and installing different combs for different areas of my beard. I also am pleased with the LED light that shows that the shaver is being charged ... a feature missing in my last couple of shavers. My only caution is in regard to long term battery reliability...again a disappointment in a past shaver. So-far-so good.</li>
            <li> This trimmer works very well. It is a bit basic, in that it only trims facial/body hair. It does not have a nose trimmer attachment or anything like that. However, it is very effective at what it does and simple to make hair length adjustments. My previous trimmer had an issue where occasionally the clip would snap down a length while using it so my beard ended up shorter than in tended, and the intervals were higher as well. There is no risk of that with this trimmer.</li>
            <li> I use the trimmer in the shower to trim my beard and head and it works and feels great! My only wish is that they would make the HEAD bigger and put a charging meter on it! Outside of that the trimmer works great!</li>
            <li> Very comfortable to handle and use.  Requires a 30 Hour initial charge.  Quality built</li>
            <li> Does what it shoUld do. Could be more utilitarian for short hair if there were more settings- e.g. 11-12 mm TO USE ON THE head NOT ONLY BEARD</li>
            <li> This is a good little rechargeable trimmer. It&#x27;s solidly built and very easy to clean, and the guard is built in so I don&#x27;t end up losing the sizes I don&#x27;t often use. The guard detaches easily for deeper cleaning.</li>
            <li> After only a month of use the battery doesn&#x27;t hold a charge longer than 10 minutes after a 3 hour charge! I don&#x27;t even use the unit more than 2 times a week.</li>
            <li> not user friendly;  beard trimming occurs in a direction opposite to the direction of hairs in beard; does not feet a natural way of trimming.</li>
            <li> This works well but I think it is a bit pricey compared to some others on Amazon. It is better than the cheapie I used to have. It works good on beard and other areas, also. The adjustable head works pretty good. Better than the clip on attachments.</li>
            <li> It does not work better around the chin. I am getting used to and learning to use this. Hoping it will be a good buy</li>
            <li> No more combs to break! Works great and I have no issues with it. If I used it every day then the battery might be an issue but it is not.  Good product. Got my eyebrows under control!</li>
            <li> Great trimer! Has a much better range of settings for a super close neat 5 o&#x27;clock shadow look then the 4 other trimers i own. I really like this one because it goes in MM&#x27;s as apposed to your usual 1,2,3,4..ect settings.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift for my husband. He really likes it. It&#x27;s one of the few that was wet/dry and it has lots of length settings. The charger works great too.</li>
            <li> Got 2 of these for Christmas gifts &amp; the guys love them!&lt;br /&gt;Great quality &amp; great price!</li>
            <li> The first thing you notice on this trimmer is that its considerable longer than most devices like it. It comes with a separate stand which holds the trimmer upright and has a charger in the base. When in the base it lights up a red light. I was looking for two things in a trimmer: 1) a precise hair depth cut adjustment and 2) not noisy to wake my wife in the morning. This unit does both exceptionally well. The depth control which is built in turns with precision on a quality mechanism. The unit has a pleasant low level hum when working. For me, a winner.</li>
            <li> I replaced a Wahl trimmer with this Panasonic and I am much happier with it. The Wahl trimmer never seemed to hold a charge very well, though it cut pretty well. On this unit, I like that the comb is adjustable, and easily removed if you want to get closer. I do wish it went a little higher than 10 mm, though that is pretty long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charging: The stand is much better than most trimmers I have owned to date. It is stable and holds the trimmer neatly in an upright position.&lt;br /&gt;Ergonomic: The trimmer is comfortable to hold while trimming. The blades cut through hair easily, and the length is quick to dial in. The comb/guide comes off and on easily, and is comfortable on my face.&lt;br /&gt;Clean up: This is a wet/dry unit, so clean up is quick and easy. Just run it under the water and put it back on the charger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I agree with other reviewers that comment on the lack of a charge meter to let you know how much battery is left or when it is completely charged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very comfortable recommending this trimmer to others.</li>
            <li> Very nice upgrade from 10 yr old Wahl I was using. Much better length control.</li>
            <li> Awesome cordless machine!</li>
            <li> I use it weekly and have had no problems with it so far.</li>
            <li> Great beard trimmer.  Battery lasts forever.  Great array of length setting and disassembles easily for cleaning and drying.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great! Bought it as a birthday present for my boyfriend and he loves it. Makes trimming his beard so much easier and it looks way better!</li>
            <li> Great design. Best looking trimmer out there, yet&lt;br /&gt;ugly color and charger. Real problem is the battery life. Leave it in the ugly charger dock for couple of hours and can&#x27;t even last a 20 minutes facial trim. Also, it has a red light on the ugly dock which never turns to any other colors after many hour in charge. Bought here, and was very exceited to receive it, but I will make an attempt to return as it left me very disappointed. Won&#x27;t recomend it to a friend.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used a razor in 37 yrs, have used a boatload of beard trimmers over the years, this Panasonic Trimmer is second to none. By far the best trimmer I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s leaves patches. I wish I could return it. Worst $50 ever spent. I don&#x27;t get. Men&#x27;s health magazine named this good product. all the previous review lies..</li>
            <li> Great cordless trimmer. Even in the shower.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t ever write reviews but I have to write this one. I always used one certain norelco trimmer, and then they stopped selling them. Over the last 6 months I bought 3 norelco trimmers and all of them would cut my beard uneven. I just got this today and just used it, stop searching and wasting your time, this is the trimmer, my beard hair grows every different way and it cut everything evenly and perfectly.  5 thumbs up</li>
            <li> Love mine. Especially the precision dial and the fact that it can get wet in the shower.</li>
            <li> I keep a consistent beard and my hair gets pretty thick.  Some spots take a couple of passes with this trimmer, but regardless in a couple of minutes I am trimmed back up to my liking.  Removing the guard allows for some precision trimming.  It is very versatile, but if you&#x27;re one to keep some very detailed lines you need to be pretty careful with this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this trimmer now for several months. It works well in and out of the shower. It holds a charge forever and cleans up easily. It fits nicely in the hand and has a reasonable amount of adjustability.</li>
            <li> Great battery life and trims like a champ. Also love that it is waterproof and has the adjustable trim guard built in.</li>
            <li> It pulls on my face and pinches. I don&#x27;t like that I have to oil all the time. My other shaver I rearly oiled and it cut great.</li>
            <li> Just Perfect and I love it will wear everyday and show off to everyone that asks, plan on ordering more...</li>
            <li> Awesome buy ! Very quiet and consistent cutting length. I really like the water clean-up and solid charging base. A definite buy for the scruffy male.</li>
            <li> So far I have enjoyed this item as I have almost everything I have ever purchased from Panasonic. My only reservation is what I perceive as possibly being a weak battery or weak motor but the performance of the item so far is a good close trim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used a Wahl for a number of years and I think I may be use to its&#x27; more powerful feel in your hand when you turn it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to use it above the 1.5mm setting unless you really want your trim &amp;#34;tight.&amp;#34; I set it at 1.5mm and I was committed! It was a little closer than I prefer it to be for a few days. I especially appreciate being able to do this task in the shower as it literally washes the trimmings away, no pesky dry cleanup around the bathroom sink.</li>
            <li> Bought for my son as gift. He used it immediately and loves how accurate and especially how quiet it is. No burn and settings are great because he just has to turn a dial for that! He loves it and won&#x27;t stop raving about it.</li>
            <li> Unless you are trying to cultivate some serious beard artistry on your face this trimmer will do the trick nicely. The waterproof design and .5 increments are greatly appreciated. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I do not have the need to use this trimmer too often, but when I need to it is great! I just don&#x27;t see why you need to oil the thing after every use.  But regardless It&#x27;s a great trimmer!</li>
            <li> I have never purchased anything on amazon that was not a good product but this was the worst item i ever bought. I would not recommend this trimmer. BAD PURCHASED................................................</li>
            <li> I like all the adjustable trimming settings on the razor.  My only complaint is that there is no place on the base to hold the brush.</li>
            <li> I love everything about this razor, but I wish it was a little wider. But that does not deduct from its rating, as most trimmers are not wide enough in less you buy professional barber shears.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the precision when it comes to hair cut length (0.5mm increments) but it does a poor job cutting compared to a typical hair clipper. It takes a bit longer with these because I have to go over my head more than usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a charging stand, but unfortunately there&#x27;s no way of knowing when it&#x27;s fully charged. Also, you might find the battery dying at the most inconvenient time. This has a charging stand, so you can&#x27;t keep it plugged in while cutting. As I type this, I&#x27;m waiting for mine to recharge. It died in the middle of a cut and I currently have a reverse mohawk.</li>
            <li> The Guard is much shorter than my previous Remington trimmer. If you want to keep a very close beard/body hair this will work for you.</li>
            <li> First off, the build quality is better than any other trimmer I&#x27;ve owned. The battery life is great. I only charge this thing like once a month. I use it at least twice a week. If you are considering a trimmer this one works very well.</li>
            <li> I have try so many! This one is the best! After several months still work perfectly, I will buy again.</li>
            <li> Works really well. The only negative it you have to go over a couple of times to get an even cut.</li>
            <li> Thought it was great until a small black plastic piece came off and now it hurts to use.  Great product for two months.  Now I have to spend hours getting through to someone and maybe get a new one.</li>
            <li> I have had terrible experience with most cordless trimmers. This one is the best I&#x27;ve used so far. Still isn&#x27;t extremely powerful, but it is very good for the price.</li>
            <li> Great trimmer!!!  Very easy to clean as well.</li>
            <li> Have been pleased with the product so far.  much quieter than the 5 year old trimmer it&#x27;s replacing.  Was a little disappointed when I read the manual and found that it&#x27;s recommended to oil the blade after each use and before the next use.  Plus you have to remove the blade from the trimmer to oil and then reattach.  This is too much of a pain.</li>
            <li> Finally a  trimmer that cuts.  I bought a Wahl about 3 months ago and it cut sort of ok for a while then it stopped cutting well.  I got the Panasonic after work today and  gave it a try right away.  Works really well.  I&#x27;ll have to figure out the MM adjustments as the combs I&#x27;ve used in the past don&#x27;t seem to be as short.  I&#x27;m happy so far, if it makes it past 4 months it&#x27;ll be worth the cost.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a basic trimmer that just works... Look no further.  I love this thing. It is easy to use, light, doesn&#x27;t vibrate your hand off, quiet, holds a charge, and trims my beard perfectly in just a few passes. Well worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Great beard trimmer. Cuts very precisely and easy to care for.</li>
            <li> Works ok but for me this and every beard trimmer i&#x27;ve owned just doesn&#x27;t cut very evenly.  I ended up just using hair clippers again.</li>
            <li> This thing has a really low-quality blade that crushes hairs and splits them. After a trim it takes days for all the split beard hears to fall out. If I run my fingers through my beard the hairs splinter and get stuck in my fingertips. They need tweezing out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it is water resistant the low-quality blade doesn&#x27;t really trim longer wet beard hairs, and even on a dry beard the longest setting (1cm) is quite short.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery doesn&#x27;t run long enough to trim a full beard on one charge, either. I need to charge it in-between a shave, and it takes a long time to recharge. Basically, if I want to trim my beard I have to set aside a weekend day to give it a few passes until it looks good. The head blocks hairs more than it picks them up and a shave requires multiple passes to get all the fliers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is maybe a good product for a man who wants to maintain a two-day stubble of a chin or has a goatee, but it&#x27;s not good for anything more than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also shaped sort of neutrally; many times I&#x27;d find I was trying to use it backwards because of its ergonomics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is well-made apart from the fact that the battery and blade are really cheap -- It&#x27;s on-par with $10 trimmers and at least those you can get closer shaves with by removing the head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It gets two stars because it does work, but barely.</li>
            <li> Great product, replaced older Norelco.  Very easy to clear stubble and never looses its charge.</li>
            <li> REVIEW FOR SHAVER AS a \\&quot;BODY GROOMING\\&quot; DEVICE ONLY...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The funny thing is that even the Panasonic website doesn&#x27;t market this device as a \\&quot;body groomer\\&quot; but Amazon&#x27;s website does.  Regardless, I owned a Norelco goatee razor with a very similar design back in the mid-nineties.  I utilized it for \\&quot;dry\\&quot; body hair trimming and it worked quite well.  When I saw this had 19 different adjustments and could be used in the shower I was \\&quot;all in\\&quot;.  Upon receipt I observed that it is very lightweight, very modern, sleek and masculine looking.  This is never a bad thing in regards to a -- \\&quot;man groomer\\&quot; tool.  The long charging time (30 hours I believe) is a minor inconvenience.  If I were still single and needed a quick groom before regular dates with hotties this would be a significant downside of this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ROUND 1:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On my first trial in the shower I tried shaving \\&quot;wet\\&quot; WITHOUT any liquid body wash.  That pointless experiment failed miserably.  The \\&quot;drag factor\\&quot; with the razor on skin was unbelievably terrible...the guard on the razor just kept bouncing across the skin but cut very little.  Thus, I immediately lathered up with body wash and began to shave away.  I went with the lowest setting and that achieved a nearly \\&quot;hairless look\\&quot;.  Someone would have to be \\&quot;up in your grill\\&quot; to see that body hair was present on your body.  Even with body wash applied I did have to hit some hairs from multiple angles.  I didn&#x27;t time it but I know I spent approximately 35-40 minutes in there to complete a FULL BODY SHAVE.  Even still some hairs were missed due to having to \\&quot;back track\\&quot; and try and hit hairs from multiple angles.  But overall it took care of 90% or so.  And possibly this will improve as my skill with it improves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor didn&#x27;t seem extremely powerful but maybe that is because it is very quiet and doesn&#x27;t vibrate significantly.  I used to trim with an Oster hair clipper and you get quite a vibration with the pro models (plugged into the wall).  The clean-up with the Panasonic is easy as you simply hold it under a stream from your shower head.  The hair frees itself from the comb area pretty easily and washes down the drain.  This easy clean-up was the most compelling reason I was attracted to the idea of \\&quot;wet shaving\\&quot;.  When you \\&quot;dry shave\\&quot; with the Oster barber clippers hairs have a way of \\&quot;flying away from you\\&quot; and making a hand vacuum mandatory.  Contrary to my Oster barber clippers I didn&#x27;t have ingrown hairs running rampant post-shave with this Panasonic.  Contrary to other Amazon reviewers opinions I thought the razor disassembled for cleaning quite easily.  I did almost feel like I was going to break it given its lightweight materials and the way the guard pops off but it was no worse for the wear.  The map pointing to where you are to oil the razor isn&#x27;t perfectly diagrammed but you get the idea upon further examination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I think this is a very good product for BODY GROOMING with the only real recommendation being that a little more TORQUE to the motor may help cut those pesky hairs on the first go-around versus having to hit them from multiple angles.  My body hairs aren&#x27;t extremely coarse (like my facial hair) and it seems like I shouldn&#x27;t have so many problematic hairs.  However, since this same problem occurs with electric facial razors it is possibly just part of the reality of shaving and the way your hairs decide to grow in different directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ROUND 2:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The body groom on the lowest setting lasted about 2 weeks.  I think this is pretty standard for body shaving.  You go 3 weeks and it is just too hairy and doesn&#x27;t look good.  On this second attempt I used Dove Body Wash on a section of my body at a time (i.e. chest, left arm, right arm, left leg, right leg etc.) since soap dries quickly when you aren&#x27;t under the water.  This worked fairly well but I believe the ergonomics issue design of the shaver plus the human body (ex. difficultto shave lower leg due to bone or knee due to thin skin surrounding it etc.) it was not \\&quot;easy as pie\\&quot; to get the job done.  On Round 2 I spent about 45 minutes in the shower and had to hit some areas twice and had to hit the hair from ALL DIFFERENT ANGLES to shave it off.  By the end you really do just want it OVER as 45 minutes under the water makes you feel like a water mammal. Again, my hair isn&#x27;t very coarse and I am a moderately hairy dude.  NOTE: I did NOT shave the \\&quot;goose neck\\&quot; nor the \\&quot;eggs\\&quot;.  I don&#x27;t believe this type of shaver is ideal for that but if you raise the guard high enough you&#x27;re likely fine if you can pull the skin tawt.  At the end of the day, I think 80-85% of the hair was \\&quot;gonzo\\&quot; but this left me doing a brief touch-up dry shave with this razor outside of the shower.  I really do believe that it is either a WET SHAVE ELECTRIC issue OR a WEAK ASS MOTOR issue.  This razor is the softest, quietest I&#x27;ve ever heard and it clearly does chop hair but if the manufacturer gave it MORE TORQUE I think I could finish shaving quicker and easier.  I imagine someone with very coarse thick hair may have more issues than I&#x27;ve had given the not-so-powerful motor on this unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My new rating for this shaver is:  *** 1/2&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Depending on how long the lifespan is on this and future results I may consider a Norelco Body Groomer on my next go-around.  We&#x27;ll see...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ROUND 3:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spent OVER 45 minutes in the shower doing \\&quot;body grooming\\&quot; (no goose neck or eggs) and even with MANY passes in all different directions I would say 25% of the hairs were missed.  I used a \\&quot;gel\\&quot; type body soap and a Dove \\&quot;creamy\\&quot; type body wash.  Neither worked much better than the other.  As a result, I had to do dry shaving outside of the shower and even that didn&#x27;t go smoothly (so-to-speak).  I spent another 30 minutes cleaning up all the MISSED HAIRS and still ended up with 10 % of the hairs being missed.  It&#x27;s an amount which will likely only by noticed by your female friend but given how much time I spent I expected better results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The KEY PROBLEMS with this shaver APPEAR to be as follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a)  The MOTOR is a weak pile&lt;br /&gt;b)  The BLADE isn&#x27;t sharp and thus barely cuts hairs and misses many so you have to hit them 12 times in all different directions&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a result, my FINAL RATING &#x3D; ** 1/2 stars.</li>
            <li> Some products just give you that sense of quality and this is one of them.  Wish it had attachments but is a precise trimmer for beards.</li>
            <li> Lithium battery, plus you adjust the blade on the fly.  This is one nice tool.</li>
            <li> The best thing of this device is that opening and cleaning the device is a matter of pulling various parts off, blowing air, then plugging it back together. No tool needed.</li>
            <li> Very nice feel and look, I like the charging station, but when it comes to functionality, falls short, can&#x27;t really leave nice, uniform, short beard, can&#x27;t use it to set the beard line, also it is not as smooth as other brands when trimming parts with thick hair..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this trimmer now for almost 5 years. It&#x27;s just great. I might look into replacing the blade bit, but it&#x27;s been trimming for years, I cant complain.</li>
            <li> Excellent design for the application. Razor sharp.</li>
            <li> best trimmer i have owned.</li>
            <li> I was very satisfied with the Panasonic cordless beard trimmer. It arrived on time and met all my expectations. My husband said it was awesome and the wet/dry part made it exceptional.</li>
            <li> Works great. I only wish it had more cutting options in between 1mm and 4mm.</li>
            <li> It was a great gift for my boyfriend for Christmas;  he loves the versatility!</li>
            <li> Y&#x27;all are gonna love this product in every way.....</li>
            <li> It was a Christmas gift for my son and he likes it.</li>
            <li> Best trimmer I ever Bought.</li>
            <li> Great gift for the men in your life!</li>
            <li> This is a very high quality razor. He says that it shaves very close.  The battery life is great.  We have had it over a month now and he has yet to charge it.  Note..he only uses it twice a week.  But I use it to block his hair too.  My hubby loves it.  He said this is the best razor he has had to date.</li>
            <li> Best beard trimmer I have owned I do wish there was a longer guard though! It&#x27;s so nice to be able to use in the shower.</li>
            <li> Overall good trimmer, but very poor description. Description of trimmer does not indicate that it should not be used with shaving cream or that it is recommended that it be lubricated after every use. Unpleasant surprises after purchase.</li>
            <li> works well.  no complaints.</li>
            <li> Gave this as a Christmas gift, was told it was wonderful</li>
            <li> Love it. Hard to beat rechargeable.</li>
            <li> Need a new charger already, only charged it twice, and now after the 30 day warranty, have to get a new one, for $32...</li>
            <li> my first orders charger braked and that changed it and its working fantastic, I recommend this product for everyone, its beautiful, silent and works great.&lt;br /&gt;its wonderful product thank you very much</li>
            <li> Great Shaver/Trimmer!! Love it!!</li>
            <li> I am saving a lot of money by doing my hair myself.  I can easily adjust the size i need for my cut.</li>
            <li> I have owned several Panasonic trimmers and shavers. They are the best in the industry in my opinion, and this is due to several reasons: fast and relatively silent electric motor, capability of using them in both dry and wet mode, close shave, nicely engineered head and good to excellent overall quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This trimmer is no exception to all these features. However, for this price, it should include a digital display showing battery charge. Additionally, you can only charge it using the included charging dock, which is a nice touch and looks really nice, but it&#x27;s definitely a pain to pack when traveling.</li>
            <li> I needed a trimmer for my head, face, and body hair. I don&#x27;t shave my body hair 100% but do need to keep it at bay or I turn into a gorilla. This trimmer looked perfect. I love the ability and way this trimmer adjusts. The battery lasts forever and I like the charging dock. This trimmer is also the quietest trimmer I have ever used. I would give this item a 5 star rating.......IF IT CUT HAIR INSTEAD OF PULLING IT OUT. Pulled the trimmer out, charged it, and went to work trimming my facial hair. It was a painful experience as it caught my hairs and pulled them out. Same results on the hair on top of my head. Did not even attempt trimming my body hair before I threw it in the trash. What a waste of $45.</li>
            <li> Quiet powerful wet/dry clippers. Feels solidly built. Will last 10+ years with good care.</li>
            <li> hello, i was surprised when it&#x27;sburned out  after one week. i&#x27;m so sad and angry it was pressent for my husbend :(((</li>
            <li> Head and shoulders above what I used in the past!  Cuts smooth and fast without snagging.  The dial up length setting is easy to use and built to last.</li>
            <li> amazing trimmer. you can shave about anywhere on ur body.&lt;br /&gt;the trimmer has few settings to change how close of a shave u want. witch is good.&lt;br /&gt;the only thing is it needs more accessories if possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i havent felt any hair pulling or any razor burns. even with using it dry.</li>
            <li> Works great! I was recommended this from a friend and is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> The trimmer worked as  I thought it would.</li>
            <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to. Comfortable and easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> I actually really like this!  Seriously, I have bought many of these, and am very hard to please.  The cheap ones will cut and snag painfully, but this is smooth, quiet, powerful, and does not snag and cut.  It is really a one-pass trimmer, thus saving time.</li>
            <li> Really like the adjustment configuration, wont slip to different length in the middle of trimming your beard.  People mentioned it &#x27;pulls&#x27; ,. yeah maybe once or twice but not bad, and honestly,. find one in this price range that never will?? Maybe when the blades begin to dull...&lt;br /&gt;Also, nice charger set up</li>
            <li> really good shaver. Love the comb</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this trimmer.  Easy to adjust, easy to hold and easy to charge.  Love the wet/dry capability.  Best one I have every had.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my fiance. He loves it. He has been looking for a beard trimmer FOREVER and this one is great. He does say that you need to mess around with the settings first to really get a feel of the length of cut and to not press down too hard. There are some reviews that complain about the maintenance and I mentioned that to him and his response was &amp;#34;Well duh, I have to clean out and oil all my electric razors. That is what you are supposed to do.&amp;#34; Battery works great. His facial hair grows SUPER FAST so he uses it pretty much every day or every other day.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend, husband loves it!</li>
            <li> slow to trim compared to other trimmers, leaves a lot of hair untrimmed.</li>
            <li> Finally a trimmer that doesn&#x27;t feel cheap...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works quite well, and has all of the necessary adjustments (without all of the attachments that get lost or take up space in a drawer)...  I like that it is wet/dry...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most importantly, it is solid...  Not cheap or flimsy like others I&#x27;ve had in the past...  Even the charging base is solid...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and it will shave your head, face, and trim a goatee all on one charge...  None of my old ones would do that after the first month of use...</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband for easy clean-up (no clean-up if used in the shower) and for ease of use. He has used it once or twice since Christmas and enjoys it. No mess left for me!</li>
            <li> So far, this is the best trim razor I&#x27;ve owned. Thanks</li>
            <li> I just got it a week ago,it looks functional if u want to shave during the shower time!</li>
            <li> Nice and quiet. I like that you can change depth without needing plastic add-ons.</li>
            <li> Great product, the only problem I find is the need to lubricate it after each use.</li>
            <li> My trimmer needs are simple:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Accurately and quickly tidy up my neckline and trim stubble below it with the bare trimmer blade&lt;br /&gt;2. Shorten up my beard to an accurate length quickly (few passes)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on other reviews, I was excited to get the Panasonic as it looked like it would fit the bill and meet  both needs in a simple waterproof package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, it does neither very well.  The motor isn&#x27;t nearly as powerful as on the Wahl 9854-600 trimmer that I previously used until its battery died.  It takes many passes on my stubble to get it short enough, and it&#x27;s the same on my beard when using the trimmer guard.  It just doesn&#x27;t grab and cut the hair quickly enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It gets worse though, and this is the real dealbreaker that is making me throw this out and get another Wahl: it grabs and pulls hair near the neckline when trimming it up! I couldn&#x27;t believe the first time it did that as I&#x27;ve NEVER had a trimmer do this before.  I thought it was a fluke and I could possibly learn to use it better, but I&#x27;ve been using the trimmer for a few months and have yet to trim without pulling neck hairs painfully.  The best I could manage was to go really slowly and carefully - any speedy movements an you&#x27;re shouting in pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To sum up why you shouldn&#x27;t waste your money on this trimmer:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It&#x27;s not as powerful as is claimed and takes a while to trim your beard with the guard on&lt;br /&gt;2. It&#x27;s terrible with the guard off, grabbing and pulling hair as you&#x27;re trimming stubble</li>
            <li> very easy to clean. I&#x27;ve had them for close to a year and they have not had any issues. I use them to trim facial hair and even to get a close shave on my head and by simply applying a little bit of the oil that came with them, they continue to go strong.</li>
            <li> Good trimmer. Bonus that it can be used in the shower too. Doesn&#x27;t have the best battery life in the world but it&#x27;s pretty solid. Worth the purchase over others I&#x27;ve had in the past.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend, and he LOVES it. Very easy to use, and great results. He uses it as often as he needs to. Would recommend!</li>
            <li> Here goes...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this after reading so many reviews of trimmers on here and this seemed to get quite a few good reviews. I replaced an older Norelco that did EVERTHING I wanted but they no longer make that model and the newer model is a POS, so I went with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice that you can change blade depth on the fly with the wheel, however, with the guard it is hard to get under you nose and edges of lips (I have a goatee) it also doesn&#x27;t do sharp edges so you will need another tool for that also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I really don&#x27;t like is the &amp;#34;stand&amp;#34; it doesn&#x27;t just plug in you need to get a stand out and charge it in a stand. I&#x27;m just tired of all the things I have to drag out just to charge something, at least make it so the cord just plugs in if I want.</li>
            <li> Has many different lengths, hard to find the right one at first. but an all around nice product. durable, and versatile. easy to clean. Nice charger.</li>
            <li> The product is as announced on the Amazon site. I received it in the set time.</li>
            <li> I purchased this based on the reviews out there. I&#x27;m not going to go crazy on this review but what I will say so much better razors out there. I&#x27;ve purchased so many over the years and this one falls somewhere in mediocrity. My goatee is the only thing the trimmer is good for. Not a great buzzer to use on your chest. It always feels like it&#x27;s pulling hair out.</li>
            <li> I like this beard trimmer. It is convenient that I no longer need to attach different adaptors for the length of my beard.</li>
            <li> best face/body hair trimmer i&#x27;ve found, but still desperately needs a more powerful motor. I have moderately thick/stiff facial hair and even without the guard the trimmer often struggles and takes way too many passes to cut everything</li>
            <li> It is a great product. it  has an ergonomic shape and the razor is very precise. If you want to have a very good beard  cut you have to own it.</li>
            <li> This little guy is amazing. Did quite a bit of research and selected this trimmer because of the reviews and the price point. It has not disappointed.</li>
            <li> Great product. Would give 5 stars if it had a vacuum, hair goes everywhere!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One caveat is, I have only used it once!&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Love the dial to adjust the cut length&lt;br /&gt;No tug or pull&lt;br /&gt;Not to light that it feels cheap, but not to heavy that it is clunky&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;The instructions call for oiling it after every use (not sure why or how to do that)&lt;br /&gt;No vacuum</li>
            <li> This is the best beard groomer I have ever owned , grooms perfectly and there are many adjustable trim sizes to chose from- well constructed and fits well in your hand - worth the price</li>
            <li> Finally the electric razor that I have been waiting for. Wet or Dry this razor is excellent and I couldn&#x27;t been happier with it. The ez to use dial depth gauge makes finding the right hair length a breeze. And the clean up is a snap too. I&#x27;m glad that I went with my gut on this one, some of the other reviews weren&#x27;t the best, there were a few complains about the charging. I let it charge for about a day and I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it so I decided to add in my own two cents about how great this wet dry razor really is.</li>
            <li> Way better then my previous trimmer.</li>
            <li> not a door buster.......it works and does the job. I do like the adjustment part of it. The charging cradle is nice and so far the battery works well.</li>
            <li> Everything was in order!  I recommend it!!</li>
            <li> The product is really nice. Shipped on time. Very easy to use it. Easy to clean hair from it. Available in reasonable price compared to other product.</li>
            <li> Great product. Very easy to adjust settings. Cuts great. I tried a couple different types. This one worked best for me. Worth the money.</li>
            <li> Works like I wanted it to. For the price it is worth it if you are on the market for  a body trimmer.</li>
            <li> After reading reviews in Men&#x27;s Health and doing lots of research, I decided this was the trimmer for me. I love it, it might not be the cheapest but it&#x27;s amazing and high quality. You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t like the hair trimmer you are use to at the barber. Takes a while to do a relatively simple job.</li>
            <li> Had to return to Amazon.  Even after charging razor did not seem powerful and did not cut beard even.  Will have to search for another electric razor.</li>
            <li> Get a plug in-  it&#x27;s OK at best, but feel a plug in is more accurate and consistent for thicker beards.</li>
            <li> not what I expected. hard to clean. to long to use and charge, instructions were vague and not clear. Not happy at all</li>
            <li> The trimmer holds a charge well and is very comfortable to use.  The main complaint I have is the depth of the cutting blade is inconsistent. Once you set the blade depth there is play in it&#x27;s variance once pressure is applied.  If you don&#x27;t have the time to go over the same area to be trimmed multiple times, this is not a good product.  Very unfortunate, due to the fact that I really like Panasonic products.</li>
            <li> The comb over the shaver has fingers that point forwards, therefore blocking your ability to shave your moustache under your nose. The fingers hit your nose and the blades can&#x27;t get to the hairs close to the base of your nose. I actually had to use sand paper to grind the fingers off. What were they thinking?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a trimmer it works OK, not great. I have to keep going over my beard to get all the hairs. The hairs seem to clog the grooves in the comb over the blades, preventing the blades from reaching the beard, so you have to clean it frequently. I keep it in the charger and I have never even come close to running out of juice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; They also want you to take the blade cartridge out and oil I AFTER EVERY USE!!!  WTF?? To make matters worse, they provide no storage for the lubricating oil that you are supposed to use daily. Not even a case useful for travel. For the reputation of the manufacturer and the cost of the device, I expected more.</li>
            <li> I had to get used to using this to trim my beard.  Old one trimmed by stroking down and this one has to be pushed up like a barber would cut your hair.  It has the depth of cut ring which takes some experimentation to get set correctly.  It is not hugely obvious which side of the ring you look at to see the correct adjustment.  Walked around with a bare strip on my beard after using it the first time.  Directions recommend that it be oiled constantly which seems like a pain.  Took me a minute to figure out how to get the head off to oil it.  You have to push the cutting blade with your thumb which seems counter intuitive but it does pop right off.  Charger is not automatic.  As long as you leave it on the charger it appears to be charging.  Never did figure out if it is supposed to stay on there all the time.  I leave it off.  Recommended best at Men&#x27;s Journal.</li>
            <li> shaver works good for what I need, if your looking for a close shave its not for you. its good for trimming beard and gotees to a manageble length. my only problem is the maintanence issue, your suppossed to lubricate two parts of this shaver every time you use it. I cant even figure out how to take it apart to lubricate the second part and the instructions dont explain how.</li>
            <li> My husband stopped shaving for No Beard November 2013, and by January I was desperate for him to have something to trim up with.  The trimmer is great.  Hubby has a mirror in the shower so I don&#x27;t have little hairs all over my sink!  Hooray!!!</li>
            <li> I needed a trimmer than can get wet when need be and remain rust-free and clean. This has worked fantastic years later, I have yet to have a single issue. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using for anything more than longish stubble, but this is perfect for maintaining a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow or trimming around a beard.</li>
            <li> Very good, the lenght adapter is great, you can use it in the shower and is easy to clean, bye</li>
            <li> One of the more expensive beard trimmers but well worth the investment. The trimmer has 19 different settings which means I can have 1 mm worth of beard that gives me that stubble look or I can grow my beard out and then trim it back to 10 mm which gives me the  Ulysses S. Grant look.  Or I could choose one of the other 17 settings to get my own custom look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not tried it in the shower because I like to look at my face while I am trimming my beard.</li>
            <li> This was a gift to my boyfriend he loved it. We actually returned one cause he loved this soo much</li>
            <li> This trimmer is a huge upgrade from my older Remington trimmer. While both have a built-in length adjustment, this Panasonic trimmer seems to be much safer, allowing a much faster shave at the same length setting along uneven terrain. The wet shaving feature also works to expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downsides are all related to the charging: there no useful battery indicator, the charge cycle is extraordinarily long, and it comes with an oddly-shaped, space-consuming charger.</li>
            <li> Wonderful results, you can not ask for more, easy to handle and perfection on the court. Very happy with the way it makes cuts mustaches and sideburns.</li>
            <li> I bought this for trimming my beard and moustache. I really have no intention of using it in the shower but I do like the fact that you can rinse it under water with no worries. Many complained about having to oil it after each use. I find that if you aren&#x27;t running it for 20 minutes at a time you don&#x27;t need to lubricate that often. Of course it you rinse it out that is a good idea. Not a problem for me. It runs very quiet and trims nicely. I like the adjustable comb so I don&#x27;t have to deal with a bunch of attachments. The comb comes off easily it you adjust the comb back to &amp;#34;1&amp;#34; first. It is nice that the blades snap out for cleaning and oiling. I checked the price of a new set of blades to have a spare set and found them to be $20. I&#x27;d replace the whole item first. Seems blades could be available for less. All in all I am very happy with the trimmer and would highly recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> Got this for my husband.  He absolutely loves it!  He tells me repeatedly that  he really likes the trim settings and the control he has with the unit.  Can&#x27;t say how it works in the shower as he doesn&#x27;t use it there.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like the fact that it has to be oiled with each use and you have to remove to very small screws to get to one of the places to oil.</li>
            <li> Long lasting battery. Cordless is perfect for travelers. Wet dry feature makes it easy to use in shower and also easy to clean. Huge range on trim settings makes perfect for just about any hair length.</li>
            <li> Awesome product easy to clean and use!</li>
            <li> I really love this product.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic trimmer is a sleek trimmer with a great build. The soft grip handle has a great feel and the trimmer itself is a quiet hum. You&#x27;ll notice the trimmer itself is a bit narrower that most other trimmers, and while that means it may take more time to buzz it will result in a very close and precise buzz. You can really get your stubble to a very fine length with this puppy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wet feature and easy clean makes it pretty versitile, but alas where this trimmer falls short (along with every trimmer minus Philips Norelco) is the vacuum feature. If you&#x27;re gonna go with a dry buzz then you will have trimming everywhere, which is why I love Philips Norelco&#x27;s trimmer. The vacuum feature adds bulk but usually saves your sink and counter from man hair. However, since you can trim wet you can prevent beard flake snow time. Great trimmer, with great precision makes this a winner.</li>
            <li> With the last trimmer I bought, it came with a whole bag full of different trimming head attachments, most of which were just used to change the length of hair it trimmed. These little attachments banged around in my bathroom getting lost and making a nuisance of themselves. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m so delighted with this trimmer, because while it doesn&#x27;t come with any accessories, it has a little wheel you can spin that sets the trim length anywhere from 1 to 10 mm long, so it&#x27;s not a fussy process to adjust the hair length. You could easily go from beard to hair in just a second by rotating the rolling wheel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My partner has a plug in trimmer that doesn&#x27;t have any kind of guard or length attachments on it at all, and I&#x27;ve actually hurt myself on it multiple times. While he really likes the power of a plug-in unit, I find that the cord is difficult to manage and makes accurate trimming difficult. If you&#x27;re trying to trim a specific pattern in your facial hair, a cordless model like this one would give you a lot more control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When used with the guard on, this is a very safe trimmer and it would be hard to hurt yourself on even when used in delicate spots like behind your ears. The one downside to it is that any trimmer with a guard trims just a little bit less quickly and accurately than one without. I still prefer using a guard, because it looks absolutely ridiculous if you scalp one portion of your beard, and I&#x27;d rather take a little more time over the process and know that it&#x27;s going to look okay after. If you&#x27;d prefer to use it without the guard, it slips off really easily and works just fine like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer charges quickly and the little charging station is easy to use and doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s always going to tip over like some brands do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a great little trimmer. It&#x27;s a lot more convenient than my old, cheaper one, and I really like how easy it is to change the trimming length.</li>
            <li> Feels solid and well constructed. Extremely easy to get a sculpted trim. And it&#x27;s waterproof. Couldn&#x27;t ask for more. Just buy it already.</li>
            <li> This is easy to use, easy to clean, and allows me to trim down the spots that need trimming.  The 19 settings make me snicker, as my whiskers are blonde and anything under 5mm might as well not be there at all.  I usually use the shortest setting or the longest.  Just be careful to watch what side of the dial you are on; I thought I had it set at 10mm (when in fact it was set at 1mm) and inadvertently chopped off a big chunk of whiskers I had really planned to keep.  After that little mishap, I paid closer attention to what I was doing, and have no complaints.  Very convenient!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my grown son as a gift to replace his other one. He is difficult to please and raves about this brand and model.</li>
            <li> I used this trimmer for the first time today.  I normally like the long stubble look and the lowest setting (#1) on this trimmer was actually a little too short for me (it looks like I have not shaved in a day).  So next time I will try the #3 setting.  The things I liked the most was it is very comfortable (did not yank the hairs) and I was able to rinse it off in the sink.  My only complaint is the instructions say do not use the charger in the bathroom.  Huh??  Where am I supposed to charge it?  Bizarre...</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend, the reviews on every site I checked said it was a really good buy.. When he used it on his beard it pulled the hair causing him pain. He tried it on his head and it died after shaving only 1/3 of his head leaving his hair a mess. He charged it for over an hour and the charge lasted under 10 minutes. Save your money.</li>
            <li> Recently, I decided to get rid of my beard and go with a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I needed a trimmer that could do a consistent job, and let me figure out the initial length. The fact that I can dial the length setting makes adjusting the setting quick and easy.  Nothing to swap out between lengths, and a quick change if I want it a little shorter.  I started out too long and quickly dial it down until I hit the length that I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the deciding factors that made me settle on this trimmer is because of the lack of pieces.  No spare combs, and things to swap out.  That&#x27;s just additional space and something else to lose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason it&#x27;s only 4 stars is because of the charger.  It&#x27;s not very travel friendly.  Unlike a lot of other trimmers which can plug straight into the device, this one has a charging stand, and no other way to charge the device.  Not a huge deal, but the limiting factor on this device.</li>
            <li> Great product. Husband has very sensitive skin. No red marks left. Very Nice!!!</li>
            <li> I thought I was going to be blown away by the results, It&#x27;s rather average. I&#x27;m a bit disappointed, but I guess I had overarching ideas of how quickly I could get a perfect &amp;#34;#6&amp;#34; throughout my face.</li>
            <li> I used 3 times, and it broke</li>
            <li> By far this is the best beard and mustache trimmer that I have used. The battery holds a charge for a long time. Adjusting the depth of cut is easy and cleaning is fast and simple.</li>
            <li> Cleans easily, charges quick, and you can use it in the shower. I also like all the different shame/trim setting with the use of one clipper cover. ( the trimmer has a adjustable hight setting.</li>
            <li> After using it the 5th time when I pulled the guide off to clean the blade area, the tip of of the two pieces in the handle that hold the guard in place snapped off. It still works, but the piece is just a tiny bit of plastic meant that has no chance of lasting. I suspect this must happen fairly often since mine happened so soon. This is sad because the item looks nice and was performing well otherwise. I can still use it with one of the sides broken off, but no idea many cleanings before the other side breaks as well and since it&#x27;s in the handle and not the guard piece itself this item will be junk.</li>
            <li> Very nicely built and east to use.</li>
            <li> This does its job well. I travel all the time with it, so my only caveat is that there&#x27;s no padded case or bag to protect it, and the charger doodad is designed to stay home - not in your travel kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tool itself is superb. Good enough to overlook the other two issues.</li>
            <li> Now I really like this trimmer.  Its easy to hold and use. The guard is pretty handy, even though I wish it had adjustments for longer hair. But to be fair none of this style do. It could use a bit more power, as it pulls the hair when using it in certain directions, like when making the beard outline.  But it works well every other time, and I am glad I got it.</li>
            <li> pros: you can clean with water&lt;br /&gt;cons: you have to go over the same spot few times to get it even.</li>
            <li> My husband liked some features and not others.  I am sorry I cant be more specific than that.</li>
            <li> So the trimmer is nice, the adjuster is great for keeping the beard just right.  The issue is taking the adjuster off to do the fine lines.  The plastic catch isn&#x27;t meant for daily removal. So get another trimmer for the fine lines and use this one for the perfect thickness.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this groomer!  He says it&#x27;s the best one he has ever used.</li>
            <li> I did a little research before purchasing this trimmer. The research paid off. It was a Christmas gift for my husband and he states it&#x27;s the best trimmer he has ever owned.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and the positive ones were spot on.  I&#x27;ve had two other different non-Panasonic models that were awful.  The last one last less than 6 months.  This is a great product.  easy to use and easy to maintain.  Very long battery life as well.</li>
            <li> Works wonderfully.  And you can use it in the shower! I give it five stars because of the even trim and ease of use.</li>
            <li> Takes awhile to get a good shave on the beard.  You have to go against the grain, or hair angle to get good results and then go over and over it multiple times. The final result is good.</li>
            <li> I bought this to trim body hair and it&#x27;s really weak.  I always feel like the batteries are almost dead even though it&#x27;s on the charger all the time and has been like that as long as I&#x27;ve had it.  The guard pushes down the hair too much so you need to basically hold the hair and then run the trimmer over it to actually cut anything.</li>
            <li> Not much power with this one. Has trouble with cutting my hair, which is pretty short. Leaves lots of stragglers behind, and I have to clean up with another trimmer.</li>
            <li> Quality trimmer, feels great in your hand and gives you good control. Look cool and works great!.&lt;br /&gt;Hoping it will last as lone as the last one?.</li>
            <li> This a well made product that I thought I would get more use out of, but the cons outweigh the pros for me and my family. We&#x27;ll be looking for something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Decent price&lt;br /&gt;* Works well. Not perfect, but well enough out of the box.&lt;br /&gt;* Good design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Very high-maintenance, way too much oiling required.&lt;br /&gt;* Adjustable, but not very powerful for tough jobs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To sum up: keep looking for something else unless you are just wanting a temporary fix.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve own many cordless groomers. My needs are not many: keep my beard and mustache trimmed. That&#x27;s it. Nothing fancy. Even so, I&#x27;ve never found a trimmer that I was truly satisfied with... Until now.  I have zero complaints. It does what I need it to do. Period!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m digging this shaver. Changing the lengths is super easy, it cuts great, easy cleaning. Really happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Originally gifted this to my husband in 2013 after his Philips Norelco T980 died (it couldn&#x27;t hold a charge after about two years).  The trimmer still works like new, but hubby shorted out the charger by plugging it into the wrong voltage whilst travelling.  He was so happy with this model that we simply stuck with it rather than trying out something new and now he has two fully functional trimmers that share one charger that he simply swaps out whenever they need charging.</li>
            <li> One of the best, most precise trimmers I have owned. it replaces a 14 year old Remington that the battery pack died on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve purchased several trimmers by different makers before this, to a one, the motors in them were all rather weak seeming. While the Panasonic is quiet, it seems &amp;#34;strong&amp;#34; enough and gets the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Putting a blade on my neck at any time except the winter causes a lot of skin irritation no matter what method or products used. So, most of the year, I &amp;#34;shave&amp;#34; from my jawline down with a trimmer. This one cuts the hair shorter than any one I&#x27;ve owned. The instructions say it will cut, without the comb in place, to 1/64th of an inch. On me, it will shorten it so that appears like a mild &amp;#34;5 O&#x27;clock shadow&amp;#34;. The Comb is twist adjustable in mm measurements, which is handy indeed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a wet/dry trimmer, but I don&#x27;t trim my beard in the shower. I don&#x27;t know anyone who does. It is, however, handy to be able to use running water to clean the trimmer. the cutter head pops off and re-inserts easily, with no small parts to break or weaken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, an excellent product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned many beard trimmers over the years. This is the best one by far. And the price is more than fair. I&#x27;ve paid a lot more for trimmers that were not nearly as good or as easy to use. I bought this one for my son, and I liked it so much I am ordering one for myself right now.</li>
            <li> It is wonderful and does the job it is meant to do. No complaints. Cuts hair, no pulling, select depth... all good.</li>
            <li> The best electric trimmer I have ever used. It is ergonomic and holds a charge for days. I bought my uncle one and he loves it too</li>
            <li> Really nice unit.&lt;br /&gt;Does a good job on my very curly beard.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean, just run warm water over it.</li>
            <li> The only downside is oiling after each use but it&#x27;s dirt simple and cleans easily!  The charge has lasted a long time so far!</li>
            <li> Easy non hassle trimmer. Love the fact that it can be used in the shower and you don&#x27;t have to fumble with exchanging or storing a bunch of different sized trim head pieces.  You don&#x27;t have to constantly keep you finger on the on switch while shaving. Just hold it an extra second and it stays on all by itself allowing for free maneuverability. It also stays charged forever.  I&#x27;m not sure what regular use is to everyone else but ours was last charged six months ago and it&#x27;s still going strong and hasn&#x27;t lost its charge during periods of non use. Oh and it doesn&#x27;t pinch in delicate areas.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  It is really designed for closer cuts.  I run it all the way out on the longest setting... for an average beard length.  This model is certainly tuned toward a close trimmed beard.</li>
            <li> To be fair, I didn&#x27;t even use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the box, opened it up, and looked for a foil attachment or something to actually shave with.  You know, not just leave behind stubble&#x27;s but actually shaven smooth so you don&#x27;t see anymore hair.  If you have a beard, you need something that can trim around your beard and mustache and leave no hair behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess other people just supplement with there regular shaver or straight razor...or simply don&#x27;t shave there neck or trim around your mustache or below your bottom lip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Update**&lt;br /&gt;The product I ended up getting which could do everything this Panasonic could do and more, was the Philips Norelco QG3364/42 Multigroom Beard Trimmer.  The mini foil attachment on this unit is EXACTLY what I needed.  You can&#x27;t claim to be a beard/mustache trimmer without it!</li>
            <li> Great trimmer at a great price. While I don&#x27;t use it &amp;#34;wet,&amp;#34; I do rather enjoy the easy cleaning it&#x27;s wet/dry capability allows. It has plenty of length options, it&#x27;s comfortable in the hand, and it does a great job with my thick beard. I don&#x27;t quite have a sense for how long the full charge takes, but I&#x27;ve had no issues getting plenty of juice for my extensive trimming job when I need it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this based on the user reviews and I was extremely disappointed. I had to go back and forth over the same area to get it to cut even. I also had to put oil on it very often.</li>
            <li> I get a new trimmer every couple of years. This ead a pleasant surprise.  Best one by far.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so quiet!  And the blade is cheap and easily replaceable!&lt;br /&gt;Thankyou Panasonic!</li>
            <li> Really likt it. It is light and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I bought this primarily to use as hair clippers.  While they may work, it just takes too long compared to a high powered corded model.</li>
            <li> it does everything, it has a very solid build quality too, feels great in hand. the charging cradle never seems to stop charging it, so i just unplug it when im not charging it in order to keep good battery health</li>
            <li> Great product. I only gave it four stars because trimming without the comb attachment could have been closer, there is practically no difference compared to the 1 mm dial on the comb attachment.</li>
            <li> Finally something that works well!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no longer looking all over for my guards and charger.  The engineering on this product makes it easy to use, clean, and charge whenever and wherever.</li>
            <li> My husband already has one trimmer and shaver. But, I gifted this to him firstly because its all in one product. You don&#x27;t have to worry much about changing the blades all the time, also you can use it in the shower. My husband liked it from the word go.</li>
            <li> Panasonic makes the best affordable shavers on the market and this trimmer is no exception.  Fairly quiet, great range of thickness, and all in all just a terrific product.</li>
            <li> Wow is the trimmer well built and works very well.  Plenty of settings and easy to use.  My hair looks terrific.</li>
            <li> Great trimmer....An all in one with out the hassel of changing heads for different cuts.Keeps a good charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> This was one of the worst purchases on amazon. After only 10 months it never held a charge and Panasonic was the worst to deal with, they just would not back up the product. After an hour phone call and being told it would be replaced, then receiving an email saying they would not replace and wanted me to get it repaired... Really. I just will not purchase anything from Panasonic again. Let just say were even.</li>
            <li> I have been testing this product out for a month now... overall i am mostly happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;+Its got an ergonomic design and it is easy to handle and use.&lt;br /&gt;+It is waterproof and works perfectly fine while showering from my tests.&lt;br /&gt;+Comes with oil and brush for maintenance. Also a comb attachment which can be dialed up to 10mm.&lt;br /&gt;+My favourite quality about this product is that it is much more quiet than other trimmers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The power button is flimsy and awkward to press.&lt;br /&gt;-Although its marketed as all-in-one, the best asset of this is the trimmer part... because it didnt give me a clean shave(leaves you with a 5&#x27;oclock shadow).&lt;br /&gt;-It will also occasionally pull instead of trimming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To summarise; if you need a small, quiet trimmer to groom your bread with; this is a product that i can recommend to you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for an All-in-One groomer for quite some time. I have reviewed both the [[ASIN:B004WIUNCG Braun Cruzer 6 Beard &amp; Head Trimmer]] and the [[ASIN:B004PXIR1W Conair iStubble]] - the Panasonic is superior to both of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t understand is, the Panasonic has settings from 1mm to 10mm ... why couldn&#x27;t they go down to 0mm so I can shave with it too? Nonetheless, this does *almost* everything I want it to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Panasonic has a huge range of simple settings, to trim stubble or beards to any desired length. And, it&#x27;s wet-dry, ergonomic, cleans easy, and can even (somewhat) trim the hair on your head. I trim my ears, sideburns, and neckline with ease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only feature it doesn&#x27;t have is the built-in vacuum (see the [[ASIN:B003U8ESI4 Philips Norelco Vacuum Trimmer Pro]]. I&#x27;ve been eyeballing that unit, what a great idea. But I haven&#x27;t tested it or even seen it in stores. Of all the units I&#x27;ve tested and personally used, the Panasonic Milano wins hands down. Battery life is great, charges fast, no complaints whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I bought this less than 2 months ago... The battery started getting weaker and shaver isn&#x27;t as good as when i first got it... i am really disappointed</li>
            <li> Feels very solid. The depth adjustment is convenient and calibrated to allow a consistent trim. It&#x27;s easy to remove the comb and expose the blade directly. It holds a charge for a long time. It has lasted weeks for me.</li>
            <li> Small, Quiet, Light, ergonomic and packs a punch! I use this as a hair trimmer and body trimmer. It does a great job and Ill get another when this one breaks.</li>
            <li> The multiple settings are fantastic for beard and facial hair trimming</li>
            <li> Needed and loved for daily maintenance.</li>
            <li> Works great never had problems with it.</li>
            <li> UPDATE: after using this trimmer for several months now, I&#x27;ve really grown attached to it.  Changing review from 4 stars to 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this trimmer and use it much more often than I do my other shaver that gives you a smooth shave (I use both, depending on the look I want for the day).  Besides just the different overall look, I like using the trimmer over the shaver because 1) it&#x27;s faster and 2) if you miss a spot, nobody is going to notice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer is waterproof-you can use it in the shower.  The benefit to this is that this style of trimmer doesn&#x27;t catch any hair--it just cuts it and lets it fall.  Combine this with the fact that one who typically uses a trimmer instead of a close-shaver will have longer hair to trim, and you can wind up with a bit of a mess on the sink and down all over yourself.  Personally, I prefer to just shave over the trash can and then shower after, but, hey, it&#x27;s an option.  The better application for the waterproof attribute is that you can just rinse the whole thing off after you use it which is nice because hair sticks to it, esp. if you recently oiled it.  Oh, yes--having to oil it... that would be a con except that I think it&#x27;s pretty normal for this style of cutter to need that.  The fact that it is so easy to do and easy to clean makes it only a mild annoyance and since I&#x27;m not aware of clippers of this style that don&#x27;t need oil, I&#x27;m not going to take any stars away.  UPDATE: I&#x27;ve gotten really lazy and seldom oil it.  It is still running just fine.  When I can hear it run a little slower than usual, I oil it and it goes back to what it was.  I don&#x27;t recommend you get lazy too, but if you do, it&#x27;s not the end of the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The body is small and lightweight and easy to hold.  The length adjuster (how close of a shave you want) is very precise from 1 mm up to 10mm, although I actually take the adjuster off and trim it to... I&#x27;m guessing... 1/2mm or so.  It&#x27;s very easy to make the adjustments and/or to remove the guard altogether.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to admit, I&#x27;m not crazy about the recharging stand.  I think they had to take this approach to make it safe for use in the shower, but I much prefer the normal charging method of plugging something into the body of the shaver itself.  The stand is kinda&#x27; big and clunky and not as good when you are trying to keep the bathroom counter cleared off and looking neat and clean.  UPDATE: I&#x27;m over it :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also would have liked the motor to be just a bit stronger and/or faster to help prevent hair from being pulled instead of cut.  I have this problem MUCH less with this trimmer than I do with the trimmer built into my shaver, but it still happens from time to time.  UPDATE: I have noticed that as long as you cut with the blades parallel to your skin (as opposed to perpendicular), my hair is almost never pulled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in summary&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Quick and easy to shave&lt;br /&gt;Quick and easy to clean and adjust&lt;br /&gt;Small, light and easy to hold&lt;br /&gt;Water proof&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Charging base is a bit awkward&lt;br /&gt;Motor could be beefed up just a bit&lt;br /&gt;Just like all other clippers of this variety that I am aware of, it requires you to oil it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
            <li> very good. is tremendous machine. never had a razor and this is excellent. satisfied with my purchase. easy to clean and meets all that is advertised</li>
            <li> I have been using it just for a few days, but first impression is AWESOME! Highly recommend it! Panasonic has done a wonderful job!!</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo3OBC1WMIKYTZ7]]The ergonomics of the Panasonic Milano Men&#x27;s All-in-one Hair and Beard Trimmer are not the best.  The trimmer is light which is good for convenience but to the point of being so lightweight that it felt cheap and plastic.  The trimmer is not well balanced and this coupled with the lightweight feel led to the feeling that it is more of a toy than a serious trimmer. The power button is located on the bottom which means that it is awkward to turn on the trimmer from the same position as you would hold it while using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer blades must be oiled after each use and a small container of oil is included.  A drop of oil must be applied in three spots.  A diagram is included on the trimmer body so that you know where to apply the oil even if you misplace the owner&#x27;s manual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer has an integrated comb rather than removable combs.  The height of the integrated comb can be adjusted between 1mm and 10mm.  If you want hair at a length longer than 10mm you are out of luck with this trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the trimming is concerned, the Panasonic trimmer works well and I had no problem using it.  The combs do have a little give, but not a significant amount and the combs remain in place even if you apply a bit of force while pressing the trimmers against your face.  Panasonic has done the comb design much better than some other brands.  I only wish that you could extend the height beyond 10mm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A summary of some of the pros and cons of the Panasonic Milano Men&#x27;s All-in-one Hair and Beard Trimmer as discussed in the video are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Can be used in the shower or under other wet conditions&lt;br /&gt;- Rather than to use combs to adjust the height of the trim, the trimmer has an integrated comb, the height of which is controlled with a dial on the side of the clippers&lt;br /&gt;- The comb can easily be removed to allow for the blades to be cleaned or to allow for fine trimming, for example squaringside burns.&lt;br /&gt;- Lightweight, but bordering on feeling too light&lt;br /&gt;- Quieter than other trimmers that I have used&lt;br /&gt;- Comb height does not change even when you press the trimmer against your face&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;- The maximum height of the comb is 10mm.  If you like your facial hair to be longer than that the clippers will not work for you.&lt;br /&gt;- The blades must be oiled before each use&lt;br /&gt;- The on / off button is inconveniently located&lt;br /&gt;- Long charge times&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would recommend the Panasonic Milano Men&#x27;s All-in-one Hair and Beard Trimmer only to people who want to take advantage of the ability to use the trimmer in a wet environment.  Otherwise, I would recommend a clipper like the Remington Titanium Precision Pro instead because it offers greater flexibility for different lengths of hair.  The Remington comes with a collection of combs which allows for a much greater range of cutting heights, has better ergonomics and does not require oiling after each use.</li>
            <li> Nice product, exactly as advertised, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Great value.  Haven&#x27;t used it much yet, but so far am extremely pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Till now, I have always used a trimmer that has a cord.  I won&#x27;t be going back.  One reviewer was unhappy about having to oil the blades so often.  The instructions do say to oil before and after each use.  I clean and oil them every few uses and they cut extremely well.  Years ago I almost threw some clippers away.  I called the manufacturer and they advised me to oil the blades.  The clippers cut like they were new again.  So, now I can appreciate the need for regular oiling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Rechargeable&lt;br /&gt;Lithium-Ion Battery lasts many uses before recharging&lt;br /&gt;Cordless freedom&lt;br /&gt;Super quiet&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Head is too large for tight spaces</li>
            <li> BEFORE YOU BUY: Remember that wet hair is longer and harder to trim. I rarely use this to trim wet hair. I use the Panasonic not only as a beard trimmer but also a general purpose body trimmer. The attachment is great, the trimmer is easy to clean and feels very nice. Major downside is having to charge this for 24h to get 1h of usage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember to oil this after every use (once it dries) and it&#x27;ll last forever.</li>
            <li> My husband shaves his head about 2 times a week. he loves this trimmer! He says is the best one he&#x27;s ever had.</li>
            <li> This trimmer works really well. I have used it for extended periods of time and the battery never bogs down and it cuts thru the hair just as expected.</li>
            <li> Great shaver. Would be better with a wider cutting area, but overall a strong shaver.</li>
            <li> Works great.  No issues.</li>
            <li> Died after two months.  The battery won&#x27;t hold a charge anymore.</li>
            <li> My old Panasonic trimmer finally died on me, which by the way served me well for years and years, so I decided to go with their new facial trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer does exactly what it&#x27;s suppose to do and does it very well. I usually keep a trimmed beard - sometimes long while other times I like to keep it real short. This trimmer allows me to keep it as long or short as I want it. With just one or two passes, it leaves my facial hair neatly trimmed without any uneven spots. One thing that I also love about it, is that it doesn&#x27;t pull or tug my hairs, which could be very annoying and painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love the fact that it has 19 settings, allowing me to keep my facial hair trimmed the exact length I want it to be. The wet/dry feature is also very convenient and lets me wash the product easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely would recommend this product to anyone that consistently keeps their beard groomed - long or short.</li>
            <li> My husband loves it!! He wanted a trimmer that he could use in the shower and this product has been excellent!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very good item and many function used .</li>
            <li> pretty and waterproof!&lt;br /&gt;from now on, I&#x27;m shaving while taking shower with no problems whatsoever.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm. Only small annoyance is oiling it before and after each use.</li>
            <li> Battery dies too quickly for manly men. I can barely trim my face before it peters out each morning.</li>
            <li> I bought this product based on the other reviews I had read and let me say it did not disappoint. I was specifically looking for a razor that was an all in one built as a beard trimmer. This is it. It is so easy to change the length by twisting the dial to quickly chose any look. The top pops off to provide a precision trimmer for closer cuts. It&#x27;s water proof and charges fast. This product met all my needs in a trimmer that I&#x27;ve yet to find in similar products.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Although I recommend you start with the thickest setting and work your way down.  The first time I used it, I realized the settings on this razor vs the ones at my barbershop differ tremendously.  Otherwise, works great in the shower, easy to clean and oil.</li>
            <li> This product is garbage. After a few months of minimal use (once or twice a week) it would no longer hold a charge. I cannot even get through a trimming without having it lose its power and begin to sputter. This results in the trimmer yanking out hair and, eventually, completely dying. This happens within just a few minutes of turning it on despite having fully charged the item. It worked fine for a brief time when first purchased but is unserviceable now. Would not recommend and will be going to a different brand for my future purchases, the first of which will be replacing this disappointing trimmer.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly, great value, love it love it! Beard is coming along nicely ;)</li>
            <li> It is amazing the difference between this and my old beard trimmer. I never thought spending an extra $20 would make such a big difference. Super precise and has a great feel in hand. I also love that I can rinse it off under running water.</li>
            <li> this is great! easy to use, no clogging and still sharp.  EDIT: two years later and the trimmer is done. conked out. pulls my husbands hair and just doesnt cut the way it used to.</li>
            <li> perfect! worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how the men&#x27;s health award was given to this razor. The motor is WEAK. Weak enough that when I was trimming around my beard, it was pulling hairs out, not cutting them. If I wanted a tweezer I would have bought one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s too bad its so weak because the rest of the design is nice. There must have been a change in manufacturing because as it functions now it&#x27;s worthless. And yes I&#x27;ve tried charging it overnight. Stay away from this one.</li>
            <li> I wish one can charge the trimmer while using it; otherwise, it&#x27;s very functional.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a couple of weeks, but have found it to be quite comfortable in my hand.  The adjustable cutting height is a nice feature.  I hope that feature proves to be durable, but I like not having removable attachments.  It seems well built, operates fairly quiet and runs quite awhile on a charge.  My only reservation is how it holds up over the long haul.  The charge is a bit flimsy, but the trimmer fits nicely in it&#x27;s place and the charger doesn&#x27;t take any real abuse, so it may last for years.</li>
            <li> I have used this trimmer now for about 3 - 4 months and I am extremely satisfied with the results.  The trimmer has nice build quality, hand feels nice in the hand and is fairly easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Adjustable guard, with 0.5mm increments.  Battery life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Not really a con yet, but the guard seems rather fragile where it connects with the trimmer - I hope that it does not break with repeated use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this to my friends.</li>
            <li> This trimmer has worked great.  The only thing I miss from my old one is a pop up blade for fine trimming of sideburns, etc.</li>
            <li> I sent it back. Not good as a beard trimmer. It would be OK if you want to keep a stubble look.</li>
            <li> NIce trimmer; well-made and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Really happy with this trimmer. Much better term than my old Phillips, which is saying a lot. Took a little time to figure out theright length settings for my beard, it shaves a little closer than my old one.</li>
            <li> works great, does what it&#x27;s advertised to do. Nice wet/dry use feature. Would recommend this item.</li>
            <li> I am quite pleased with this item.</li>
            <li> I love this razor. Use it every day.</li>
            <li> as good as advertised</li>
            <li> Very good quality works nice</li>
            <li> Best beard trimmer I have ever owned, by far. Well made, easily adjustable and does not &amp;#34;catch&amp;#34; my face, even in a close trim, which I use often. It cuts even and the blades are sharp. Highly recommended and the seller was by far cheaper than any retail store.</li>
            <li> Works great, solid product, nice clean cut.</li>
            <li> This is one excellent beard trimmer!  My husband has Alzheimers &amp; I&#x27;ve had to begin shaving him.  Before this shaver/trimmer  arrived it was a stressful job for myself &amp; him.  Ouch here, pulling there.  Now I can shave him in a very short time &amp; he is more relaxed. I&#x27;m so thankful I purchased this beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> i have tried a few brands before but this is the best so far. if u r looking for one.. this is the one u should go for</li>
            <li> Best thing since the light bulb was invented</li>
            <li> This trimmer feels solid, well made, durable. Looks good, is easy to handle and the dial for the length setting is great. There are so many settings, so you know you will definitely find the length you need, no matter what the style or what you;re trimming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem is that it does not do well with thick, coarse (african american beard)hair at all. It does not want to cut through it/shave it off. It gets stuck and tugs/pulls. This was really disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only other issues were that it takes a long time to charge up and the charge seems to die off quickly, but that could have been because of it struggling to cut through the coarser hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it had more power, it would be a great trimmer. It seems like they made it built to last and the length options are great without having to switch out clips, but if it can&#x27;t cut through the hair, none of the good stuff really matters.</li>
            <li> I have a rather incomplete beard with lots of find blonde hairs thrown in amongst my darker stubble, this trimmer doesn&#x27;t tug and pull my finer hairs like others i&#x27;ve had.  The battery life is incredible on this, i can shave for weeks at a time without ever having to charge this thing, and it doesn&#x27;t start degrading the performance of the trimmer as the battery drains, its a very consistent experience until the battery is almost completely dead.  The charging stand looks nice and the trimmer sits securely in it, overall very pleased with this</li>
            <li> EDIT: Panasonic just confirmed that the battery life is only two years.&lt;br /&gt;The replacement battery is $20. Poor battery life on a product that is used once a week forces me to downgrade this to one star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this twice a week for the past year...(mostly light trimming).  The removable head is now broken because of the cheap plastic tabs that secure it to the shaver head.  The one real complaint is the removable head.  It is difficult to get on and off.&lt;br /&gt;The power button is not easy to switch on and off.&lt;br /&gt;The shaver can only install into the base one way, and it is a bit awkward to insert into the base...more like fumbling around to get it seated correctly.&lt;br /&gt;My cheap hair trimmer (you know... the kind they sell on tv for getting the little hairs off your neck), actually does a better job at trimming my facial hairs.  With this shaver, I have to go over and over the same area of my mustache to get it to cut.&lt;br /&gt;Other than what I have mentioned, the body and the cutting head seems to be well made and the rubber housing keeps the shaver from slipping in your wet hands...oh, and you can use this wet or dry.</li>
            <li> Great product. I love the way I can adjust the shaver head for various depths of shave. I use the waterproof feature frequently and rinse it daily.</li>
            <li> So far this trimmer is pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Light&lt;br /&gt;- Wet/dry&lt;br /&gt;- Many usable settings (unusual among trimmers - this has some really good settings for short beards)&lt;br /&gt;- Durable&lt;br /&gt;- Charge holds for a couple weeks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t seem all too powerful. It does cut okay, but it feels like it doesn&#x27;t always have enough power.&lt;br /&gt;- Worried I can break it every time I pop the guide off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, this is pretty good all around; you&#x27;ll probably be just fine at the price point.</li>
            <li> This shaver is awesome I use it in the shower and out of the shower I&#x27;m really impressed with how well it does both ways the only  thing I can say is bad about it is kinda hard to clean behind the blades without taking the shaver head off.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this trimmer.  It gets all the spots covered on the face, and doesn&#x27;t miss anything. love that you don&#x27;t need to replace plastic parts if you want a different level trim, you just turn the adjustable dial.  Clean-up is very easy.  I don&#x27;t use it for shaving (I use a razor blade for the areas I want to straight shave) so I can&#x27;t speak to how effective it is at shaving.</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer to replace my Norelco Vacuum Turbo Trimmer. This trimmer doesn&#x27;t come close to the power I was used to with the Norelco. The Panasonic trimmer pulled my facial hair instead of trimming it. It worked fine for trimming body hair in the shower.  I would not recommend this trimmer as in all in one, maybe as a body trimmer.</li>
            <li> Used for my balding head, works fairly well; waterproof a big plus as can use in shower with no clean-up to speak of.  Cutting could be better as needs multiple passes, but I had no pulling as described by some others.  Would be better if had some indicator as to charge level.</li>
            <li> Does a very nice job...much better than my previous trimmer.  I really like the adjustable comb, and the capability to use it in the shower.</li>
            <li> Bought for my son who has a heavy beard; he loves it.  And at a surprisingly good price. Of course, as the description suggests, it can be used wet or dry.  Also, it is very substantial with a sturdy grip.</li>
            <li> I have a thick beard and it is just too weak for my liking. I have to make too many passes to cut my beard down to get an even look. Also the instructions tell you to oil the blades before and after each use. It is a bit annoying for everyday or every other day use, but it does make a convenient traveller.</li>
            <li> Great product love that it&#x27;s water proof makes cleaning a breeze just wish it had the ability to remove the guard to clean up the edges.</li>
            <li> Yes. The fact that this is both wet and dry is unique. One would think more companies would capitalize on this, but of course not. Yes it is great at not nicking one&#x27;s skin or lips, easy to clean and oil, and easy to charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it is absolutely horrible at power. So many reviews out there list this as the best cordless beard trimmer, and it is so blatantly obvious that none of these reviewers have ever used it or ever used it on an actual beard grown from human hair. And I don&#x27;t even mean beaver pelt man-face covering kinds of beards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The motor is just pathetic. It takes easily 4x as long as using a corded Wahl trimmer, and it comes out uneven and botched with this trimmer anyway. Which takes more time. Sure, one can do that in the shower and have virtually no clean up...as long as one is prepared to take an hour long shower to trim any beard that is longer than the shortest settings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And recharge time of 15 hours? No.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately if you want a wet/dry beard trimmer, there is NO GOOD OPTION that can be bought right now. I&#x27;ve tried them all. It&#x27;s a fantasy at this point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only way you should consider buying this is if you want to trim a beard slightly longer than stubble. And it is really bad at fitting under the nose to get the mustache trimmed. Full beard, or thick beard (5-6ish mm)? You&#x27;ll hate yourself with this. Honestly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a hairy guy and like to keep well kept. The ease of use with the quick length adjustment is great when going from trimming my eyebrows to 5 oclock shadow to chest hair. The motor is strong enough to where it actually cuts the hair and not just pull it out etc. With this item i feel like you get all the utility of a super high end tool in the palm of your hand. This is the second time I&#x27;ve purchased this trimmer only because I dropped my previous one right on the head and bent the blades.</li>
            <li> It is Rechargable, quiet, lightweight and very comfortable to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t found any cons so far and the best trimmer I have used up to date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The built-in adjustable settings is also excellent as you don&#x27;t have to carry additional parts.</li>
            <li> Great for what I&#x27;m needing for my face to keep it trimmed and looking great. Cleans up very easily under water.</li>
            <li> Works great, just not able to get a very close shave. Overall great item</li>
            <li> quiet, powerful, durable, very easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;best value facial hair trimmer i have owned&lt;br /&gt;highly recommended&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;wish the light would turn green when it was done charging</li>
            <li> Is not strong as they promote in the commercials.</li>
            <li> I love the adjustability, durability, and the fact that it is waterproof! So easy to clean and holds a charge for a sufficient amount of time. The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because the trimmer isn&#x27;t as powerful as I would prefer (I would attribute this to the fact that it&#x27;s waterproof - some power is sacrificed for that flexibility).</li>
            <li> Great little bush wacker</li>
            <li> I wont use anything else.  Not as sharp and powerful as I would like, but the settings allow me to get the exact look I want.  Just be ready to go over the same area a few times, and keep those blades clean!</li>
            <li> My last beard/mustache trimmer, the [[ASIN:B0009OMU0A Remington MB-200 Titanium Mustache and Beard Trimmer]], turned out to be a waste of money.  Not long after buying it, the non-replaceable battery was no longer able to hold its charge for more than a day or so.  So far, though, I have been impressed with this Panasonic trimmer.  After a few weeks, using it once or twice a week, the initial charge is still going strong.  In that regard, the Panasonic easily beats the Remington.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More important to me, though, is the level of precision this Panasonic Trimmer offers.  The dial lets me select any length from one to ten millimeters, in steps of 0.5 millimeters.  For the most part, all the extra features (comb attachments, easy to clean with water, etc.) are irrelevant to me, and I&#x27;ve yet to really test them out.  But for a precise and reliable trim, with a battery that won&#x27;t die unexpectedly, this has been a great trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One side note...one reviewer noted that the trimmer needs to be oiled each time it&#x27;s used.  It&#x27;s true.  That&#x27;s exactly what the instructions suggest.  If you dig around in the instructions for most trimmers, they will say the same thing.  Yes: frequent oiling is important for extending the life of most trimmers.  Having said that, it&#x27;s really up to you.  Oil it regularly, and it will probably last longer.  However, you could probably get away with less frequent oiling without causing any problems.  Personally, I&#x27;ve been oiling it after every 3 or 4 uses.  I would probably oil more frequently if I washed it with water each time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this has been the best trimmer I have had in a long time.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really work that great for me... The blade is narrow, and the settings are great for a beard, not so good for stubble. Doesn&#x27;t seem to have much power, and you are supposed to take it apart to oil it after every use. It is nice that it can be used wet.</li>
            <li> I was tired of having all my hair trimmings cover the bathroom sink and my wife going crazy with the mess.&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer is powerful enough to use on my head as a close crop device and works brilliantly in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;As with any trimmer, the downside is keeping the device clean.&lt;br /&gt;Charging the device as been easy with a long battery life lasting 5 days of daily, once a day use for head and beard trimming.</li>
            <li> Product showed up on time. Trimmer works quite well dry. I haven&#x27;t used it in the shower. Seems very well made. Used for 3 weeks so far.</li>
            <li> This is my first beard trimmer so I really can&#x27;t compare it to anything else.  I really like the fact that this trimmer is quickly adjustable in 0.5mm steps without having to fool with different attachments.  You can quickly dial-in what you want which is nice.  I think the speed of the trimming mechanism could be faster and as a result multiple passes are required to get the job done.  The shape of the head is not the greatest for some curvatures under the chin but you can manage okay...  I think they&#x27;d be better off with a more rounded head to help with this.  Other than that the unit has a decent quality feel to it and I expect it will last a number of years....  Also it seems to last a long time on a single charge... I usually charge it up once a week and trim 3 times per week but I&#x27;m sure I could easily go 2 weeks without a problem... maybe longer.</li>
            <li> Works great! Nice settings easy to clean and great battery life. I would recommend it to others, I do not have a super thick beard but it handles the hair I have very well, both trim and edging</li>
            <li> My last trimmer finally died and because of its quality, had already had damaged parts.  This trimmer, while lacking things such as a nose trimmer and &amp;#34;shaver&amp;#34;, is a much better tool and takes my beard length down to a millimeter or so without the spacer blade.  It is sturdy and holds the charge well.  It even looks better.  I was additionally pleased as an email from Amazon Prime told me this product was 50% off and when I clicked on the link discovered it was a best seller and had received awards for its quality and performance.  Great savings on a great product.  I&#x27;m very happy, but my wife still wants me to shave ALL of my beard off.  Ain&#x27;t gonna happen.</li>
            <li> I am kind of a Panasonic fan boy - I have many of their products (plasma TV, audio equipment, kitchen appliances) and generally, they are all at the very top of their categories. I was excited to try out this shaver, since I&#x27;ve tried many and found only one that I liked: the [[ASIN:B004WIUNCG Braun Cruzer 6 Beard &amp; Head Trimmer 1 Count]]. But I though, surely there&#x27;s room for improvement, and the Panasonic, with it&#x27;s built-in adjusting wheel seemed promising. Sadly, the trimmer in action falls far short of the less expensive Braun. Let&#x27;s start with the charging routine: where the Braun takes one hour to fully charge its NIMH batteries. The panasonic needs 8 to charge its antiquated nicads. In use, the Panasonic&#x27;s adjustments seem to be more for show than use. Despite the minute adjustment steps, the results, at least on my beard, are so uneven that it makes little difference. Perhaps they&#x27;re useful for someone with an extremely dense beards, but it barely worked for me. The Braun, on the other hand, works extremely well, providing very consistent, even trimming on all parts of my beard. The Panasonic looks better on paper, and dosen&#x27;t have a very silly name (CruZer? Really?) but it&#x27;s simply not made well. Perhaps it works better as a hair trimmer  - it sure looks like many people like it. But having tested many trimmers over my many bearded years, the Panasonic is nowhere near the top.</li>
            <li> Very nice shaver. Easy to adjust the settings and pretty quiet.</li>
            <li> Over the years I have purchased a number of trimmers with attachments that snap on to control the depth of cut.  Adjustable depth allows you to  start on the long side and reduce the length of the cut with a click or two.  No more digging for the right attachment.  Really cuts my beard well and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband to replace a different clipper. I love that it is water proof!! He likes the closeness of the clip. He uses for trimming the back of his neck and side bernes.</li>
            <li> It trims well.  I wish I could trim farther than an inch from my face but as I understand things very few trimmers do that anyway.</li>
            <li> The unit works well enough, but oiling it according to instructions seems excessive.</li>
            <li> Bought it, used it twice and now sitting in one of my bathroom cabinets. The Close shave doesn&#x27;t do a good job and the trimmers don&#x27;t give you a consistent length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went back to my old Conair iStubble.</li>
            <li> love the different levels this offers.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my son. He loves it!</li>
            <li> I bought the Panasonic ER-GB40-S based on recommendations from other sites instead of sticking with what I know works. This trimmer cuts uneven and leaves straggler hairs. We tried to use it to cut my 3 year old sons hair and it didn&#x27;t make a dent. My daughter used it to give me a buzz cut and it left uneven patches and stragglers; same goes for using it on my beard. Basically this is one of those instances where you get what you pay for. I&#x27;m just waiting for it to die so I can buy another Wahl.</li>
            <li> I tried this on my chest hair and got disappointed. I gave two star since this is good for wash and trim kind.&lt;br /&gt;But the description of the product I felt as misleading. Might be same for others too.</li>
            <li> Very good product! The ONLY down side is that I have to take the guard off to clear the clogged facial hair. I do recommend buying it!</li>
            <li> There are some great things to be said about this trimmer. I love the adjustability of it down to 1/2 millimeters by the simple use of a spinning wheel. No need to change heads. Very cool feature for sure. It&#x27;s also very nice to use in the shower and not create a mess all over your counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT! Expect to spend quite a bit of time hitting the same spot over and over again until it actually gives you a nice even trim. This is basically a $10 trimmer with a bunch of really cool options. So don&#x27;t expect a fast job. Expect it to take as long as a crappy trimmer would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will keep this for my shower so I can keep up with my buzz cut on a semi-daily basis but for larger jobs I&#x27;ll look into getting a professional Oster.</li>
            <li> Perfect. Well made. Adjustable. Does the job very well.</li>
            <li> Got it on sale, only reason I bought it.  Hair gets everywhere, no vaccuum.  Super loud.  But the biggest problem is, when you take the head off to do some fine detail trimming or trim around your mouth, it pulls your hair out.  This thing is junk compaired to Norelco.  Don&#x27;t bother with it when Norelco is the same price and comes with a vaccuum.</li>
            <li> How hard is it to find a decent trimmer? Don&#x27;t be fooled by this one&#x27;s streamlined looks, you have to go over and over your face numerous times to get even a mediocre trim. I like to keep my stubble short, 1MM, and after a week of screwing around with this trimmer, I dug my old one -- a Philips -- out of the cupboard. Its a few years old but does a better job than this one. BTW, the Panasonic nose trimmer I bought at around the same time is similarly terrible. Worked fine for a week, now whirs around loudly and barely trims hair. Double disappointment from Panasonic.</li>
            <li> Its been extremely handy having a trimmer that can be washed with water to clean. Keeps the razor sharper and the trimmer cleaner over all, for a longer period of time. The extension is very sturdy and accurate to 0.5mm</li>
            <li> Works as expected battery life good and easy to clean and maintain.</li>
            <li> Best trimmer I ever used. very solid in your hand, not to big. Although it has a lot of plastic parts it seams very reliable. I own mine over a year &amp; just bought this one for my teenage son because I like mine so much (&amp; he keeps taking mine). Yes I&#x27;m cheap &amp; haven&#x27;t spent a lot on trimmers but this one cuts the hair without roughing up the skin &amp; the settings lock in so no oops to short because it moved. Any shaver that can be used in water is a great shaver &amp; all mine are wet dry. All I can say is shaving is very personal &amp; you just have to look around to find what works for you.&lt;br /&gt;I do get at least 3 shaves head &amp; beard before recharging.</li>
            <li> 10mm is not very long, so look elsewhere if you want more like 1/4in</li>
            <li> Received quickly and comes with everything you need. It works great for trimming to stubble on my face and neck and love that it is waterproof. Do not however buy this if you plan on using to trim your head. I shave my head however sometimes I like to keep some stubble and this razor is almost impossible to get an even trim on your head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall if you plan on using this for anywhere except your head then I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a good buy otherwise look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I found the teeth of the comb/guide too far apart to effectively lift my beard for trimming. I think it might work ok for trimming longer beards down to short lengths, but if your goal is to maintain a 1-2mm &amp;#34;haven&#x27;t shaved in 4 days&amp;#34; length, look elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main problem, though, is that the battery didn&#x27;t even last a year before it got to the point where the trimmer would go from a full charge to completely dead in about 45 seconds. Sorry, I&#x27;m not a speed shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem could be with the charging stand, though, since it seemed difficult to seat the trimmer in it correctly to make contact with the charging posts. But it may have just been hard to tell because the charge indicator light quit working completely after a couple of months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on the hundreds of glowing reviews, it&#x27;s entirely possible that I just got a lemon, but even when it was new and actually worked long enough to trim my whole face, it did such a bad job that I usually had to go back and shave anyway to avoid looking like I had mange.</li>
            <li> No more dirty sink, I use this in the shower and keep my vanity clean. I love the numbered dial, it gives me easy and accurate repeatability as I do the sides of my beard shorter than my chin. Very nice, simple to use trimmer.</li>
            <li> Turned out to be pretty much exactly what I expected after reading the description and reviews.  A little quieter than expected and almost sounds like it&#x27;s not going full bore, but that&#x27;s not really a complaint since it cuts really well.  Without the length adjuster on top it seems good and sharper than expected for precision trimming.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend loves this!</li>
            <li> Great product..fast delivery</li>
            <li> Thought this was going to be a winner but it didn&#x27;t cut properly and we returned it. Not sure if it is a design fault or a one off. The amazon return experience was easy though.</li>
            <li> So when I opened this package, I was really excited. The trimmer is sleek, the charging dock is awesome, and I loved the way the adjustable comb settings work.... but, that&#x27;s where my enjoyment stopped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I used it for was to trim the 2 weeks worth of growth that I had, and then to get my goatee even. I wasn&#x27;t impressed. I&#x27;ve owned lots of beard trimmers, and they just really aren&#x27;t built to last. This is both a blessing and a curse. It&#x27;s nice, because I&#x27;m always getting to try the \\&quot;latest and greatest\\&quot;, bad because I have to invest another $50 every few years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, my previous experience was with the \\&quot;Remington Titanium\\&quot; trimmer, and I loved it, but the battery stopped charging so I had to replace it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed about the Panasonic was that, when fully charged, it sounded just like my Remington did when the battery was about to die. It just doesn&#x27;t seem like the motor is moving as quickly, like the power just wasn&#x27;t there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me also mention that I use this to trim, not only my beard, but also to shave my head about once a month... Here&#x27;s how it worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trimming the weeks worth of growth was okay, it seemed to get pretty close, however it required multiple passes to make sure that an area was clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Evening up the goatee (about 5 months of growth) was hit an miss. Had to make about 3-4 passes over a single area, at different angles, to get everything even in that one spot. What should have been a 3 minute process took close to 15. Not helpful when you&#x27;re trying to get ready for work in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For shaving my head, I decided to try the wet function, and use it in the shower. Big mistake. Once the hair gets wet (and we&#x27;re only talking about a half inch of hair at the most) it clogs the trimmer so it has to be cleaned after every other pass, and even then, it&#x27;s not cutting everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I had to quit in the middle, get out of the shower, dry my head thoroughly, and have my fiancée help fix the mess that I&#x27;d made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As she was trying to use the trimmer, she asked me if the battery was dying, because the motor seemed so sluggish, I told her that it had been charging for the past 18 hours or so. She remarked, \\&quot;wow, this thing doesn&#x27;t cut very well does it?\\&quot;. There you have it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had really high hopes for this thing, but it just couldn&#x27;t compete with the last trimmer I had. So, I&#x27;m going to be returning this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It might work for someone who just has the occasional couple of days worth of stubble to trim, or someone who likes to keep their goatee really short. But if you&#x27;re looking for a comprehensive grooming tool, this just isn&#x27;t in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROs:&lt;br /&gt;-Sleek design&lt;br /&gt;-Charging stand&lt;br /&gt;-Water pass-through hole for easy cleaning&lt;br /&gt;-Comb adjusting knob is really precise&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONs:&lt;br /&gt;-No power, the motor is just turning too slowly&lt;br /&gt;-Slow motor causes clogs&lt;br /&gt;-Comb lengths are just too short&lt;br /&gt;-Wet function is a joke without a stronger motor&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall? I&#x27;m gonna head back to Walmart and buy another $20 Remington Titanium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS: None of this is Amazon&#x27;s fault. It was actually delivered early. Love being a Prime member!</li>
            <li> The shaver motor died after less than 18 months. I would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I have had the trimmer for a couple of weeks and use it only for cleaning up the hair on the back of neck of my son&#x27;s neck. Constant oiling of the device is required for good clean cuts. Trimmer works fantastic is quiet and easy to clean. Also, the trimmer holds a charge so no need to constantly charge or charge before every use. I cannot comment on all the settings because I do not use them, but I am very heppy with it for how I use it.</li>
            <li> Cuts well, holds a charge and is easy to hold. You do have to make multiple passes while cutting hair.</li>
            <li> Seems a bit underpowered.  I&#x27;m used to a plug in whal.  It really gets the job done.  The portability and shower use are nice.  But I have to go over things a couple of times and it seems to take awhile.</li>
            <li> Nicer than expected. Have used it twice. Very comfortable to hold and looks nice enough to keep in its charger on the bathroom counter - sort of. The directions say it&#x27;s okay to keep it on the charger. I&#x27;m just going to trust that they&#x27;re right. Plenty powerful enough for trimming my goatee. No pulling at all. Haven&#x27;t oiled it yet, since I haven&#x27;t put it under water. Will probably oil before next trim.</li>
            <li> Love this shaver. Already owned one when I picked up this Panasonic, but wasn&#x27;t terribly satisfied with what I was using and thought maybe an upgrade would be worthwhile. Without question, it was. This shaver is easily adjustable to varying lengths, but it&#x27;s not so easy that you&#x27;d accidentally adjust the length and lop off that hard earned beard. Nice too that the shaver is waterproof.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does tend to get whiskers lodged in the guard, but it&#x27;s easy enough to pop off and clean. Haven&#x27;t found that it really has any impact on the performance of the shaver when this happens. It does seem like it takes awhile to fully charge, but the charge lasts awhile. Also wish that the light changed from red to green (or something) to indicate that it has reached a full charge. A minor critique only. All in all, really pleased.</li>
            <li> This is the best trimmer ever! It doesn&#x27;t pull, it stays charged a long time. It&#x27;s worth every penny and more!! I&#x27;ve tried 3 other trimmers and they were all junk compared to this one.</li>
            <li> I got it pretty quick, very light weight and holds a charge for a long time. The adjustable head was new to me but easy to use and no issues while cutting, take off the adjustable head and you can pretty much shave with it</li>
            <li> I like how quiet this trimmer is, it is barely noticeable.........almost sounds like a low battery trimmer.....but of course when you go to use it, it trims like a beast, very easy, numerous guard settings.....................&lt;br /&gt;trimming without the guard isn&#x27;t as smooth as some on the face, but that is what razors are for..best trimmer I have ever used.it lives on the charger, and it is made to not &#x27;over&#x27;-charge which is very convenient</li>
            <li> Best beard trimmer I ever bought</li>
            <li> This is the best trimmer I have had. If you have short hair you can even trim that.</li>
            <li> Great idea, and it works OK, but I have to go over the same area multiple times to get the hairs clipped.</li>
            <li> Versatile and dependable. Like clean out feature.</li>
            <li> Expected performance, unexpected but welcomed results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;General consensus or performance is accurate. But definitely a time saver!</li>
            <li> Product is better than I expected. Threw out my old one right away. Works great and easy to clean. Being waterproof makes cleaning easy. Would buy again without hesitation.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  It arrived when expected and was packaged properly.  It offers me the added convenience of being used without the cumbersome electrical cord.  It exceeded my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;bc</li>
            <li> Great trimmer, not sure how much you &#x27;actually&#x27;  have to oil it. They advise after every use..</li>
            <li> Works well, stays charged, at least at about months.</li>
            <li> Wonderful. !! It trims my goatee just right ! 👍😎</li>
            <li> Best beard trimmer I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> What a great way to keep your beard trimmed,ant it&#x27;s portable too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never left a review on a product I&#x27;ve bought before because they have always directly reflected their review and I wouldn&#x27;t buy anything with a poor overall rating. This product, however, is worthless. It pulls your hair! It does NOT trim or cut! Even on a \\&quot;3\\&quot; it was pulling my hair on my face! What makes me so pissed is that I basically threw away $45. Do not waste your money! This is the first product I&#x27;ve been burned on and the first Panasonic product I&#x27;ve ever bought. Go home Panasonic. You&#x27;re drunk.</li>
            <li> Works ok. Long battery life. Gotta go over same area a few times to get all hair the same length</li>
            <li> If your a hairy guy like me and is tired of using several different shavers for your entire body this is the way to go. I use it pretty much everywhere except for the top of my head. Cause i shave my head with a blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this thing could cut at a faster speed i would have given it 5 stars. Hoping in time they will have one with more power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still working good after four months.</li>
            <li> i have proplem with this product,&lt;br /&gt;i can&#x27;t  recharge again</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband and he loves it.  Definitely worth the higher price compared to other brands.</li>
            <li> I have been impressed with this trimmer and will buy another when this one finally wears out. I have tried several over the years and this one is at the top of my list.  I really like the water port for cleaning.  The only drawback that I&#x27;ve found is it doesn&#x27;t have the ear and nose attachment, but still won&#x27;t keep me from buying it again.</li>
            <li> Purchased this trimmer because my old trimmer would not hold a charge. I&#x27;ve only had it a few weeks and used it a handful of times,  but it seems to work very well and is extremely well made.</li>
            <li> great product great service</li>
            <li> Tried using this for a few weeks, but at 1.5mm to 2.5mm, it has a *very* uneven trim and is basically unusable.</li>
            <li> I recommend because it has a great performance considering its price. Good benefit-cost ratio and the battery lasts longer than i imagined.</li>
            <li> Have really enjoyed this.  I use it In the shower and the charge last for several shaves. I have used several other cheaper beard trimmers and the guard would give an uneven cut, this one is smooth and accurate</li>
            <li> best shaver i had ever</li>
            <li> I bought it not expecting to much but this is perfect I recommend to anyone trust me you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Good things about this trimmer are it keeps a charge for quite some time. Guess depends how much you use it. Being cordless is always a plus. Being able to quick rinse is nice as well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The part that really annoys me is that you have to go over the same area quite a few times to cut it all off that length. For some reason it doesn&#x27;t get all the hairs the first, nor second time. That&#x27;s why it has me looking for a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ps. Does a lot better on the pubes then face!</li>
            <li> Nice trimmer for the beard. Cuts well and is nice and easy to adjust the cut length.&lt;br /&gt;Only thing that I can think to make it better would be ION battery.</li>
            <li> Great beard clipper for the price.  I would buy this again and recommend to anyone looking for a trimmer.</li>
            <li> Works great, lots of settings for a precise trim.</li>
            <li> I was hoping by spending more money on a beard trimmer it would be of higher quality.  I was replacing a very old, inexpensive beard trimmer because the blades were dull and snagged on my beard which was painful.  Sadly, this new trimmer with sharp blades did the same thing.  I tried it several times but each time it would pull the hairs on my beard.  I did work well with the plastic blade guard for shortening the beard but the trimming function did not work at all.</li>
            <li> The thin plastic holders for the head broke the third time I used this.  I don&#x27;t see any easy way of replacing those parts.  The cutter is quite narrow as well.  I prefer the prior Panasonic wet/dry beard trimmer to this one by far.  And it&#x27;s cheaper!</li>
            <li> This would cut my beard too short so I returned it.  Although the construction of the item is solid and would have been nice had I wanted a little bit of beard.</li>
            <li> One stop shop, wet/dry trim beard trimmer to 1.0mm, and can take the  guard off and shape as well...I am learning to use this daily as my only shaveng tool and its working, this is the real deal</li>
            <li> great tool. for facial hair</li>
            <li> I was really happy with this product at first. I love the charging stand and has a good solid feel in my hand. Feels well made. However, I didn&#x27;t own this thing for more than a couple weeks and the plastic height adjustment piece broke. All I did was remove the guard to line up my beard, and as I was removing it, something popped. Now I can&#x27;t get it to stay on. It just falls off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this trimmer for just under 18 months and the charging station has stopped, well, charging.  I know that things aren&#x27;t built to last any more, but you figure it&#x27;ll work for at least two years, right?</li>
            <li> Excellent power to make quick work of trimming my beard.  Comfortable to hold and not too heavy.  Easy to clean and maintain.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This was 3rd trimmer I ordered. This one is really good among them..</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product, I totally recommend this beard trimmer, for the price I paid I think I made an excellent deal!</li>
            <li> the best trimmer ever. i have tried all of them: remington, wahl, phillips/norelco.</li>
            <li> Very nice trimmer.  Almost no pull of hair.  I would buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing my son&#x27;s beard after he has used these.  We are going&lt;br /&gt;to tame the hairy animal.  Thanks for the quick mail out.</li>
            <li> My husband love this!</li>
            <li> Works well and I am happy with it.</li>
            <li> This is a great trimmer.  i have used many other brands and this is by far the best.  I downgraded it one star because it could use better instructions.</li>
            <li> it stop working in the middle of second use and it&#x27;s not charging anymore.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my son and he likes it a lot. Plenty of adjustments for different lengths.</li>
            <li> Does an awesome job of trimming my beard, fixing my side burns, and cleaning up around my neck. Light, easy to use, and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I only got this for my precious coin sack, it didn&#x27;t work there.. I saw so much blood in the last several months I&#x27;m trying to find a reason not to go to the shower for this month ( hence passing time writing a review!)&lt;br /&gt;No matter how careful or how much shaving cream I use or don&#x27;t use.. it cuts the thin skin very easily.&lt;br /&gt;I know its not designed to work there. For the face it does the job right. I had some problems on my adams apple, but no blood was shed!&lt;br /&gt;Its very quiet, although I don&#x27;t oil it as much as it wants, and it holds the charge very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It gets sometimes annoying putting it in the charging base, but if you use it more often than me, I&#x27;m sure it will be a second nature and you don&#x27;t have to think about how is it suppose to sit in that ugly base..</li>
            <li> I use this trimmer mainly for my moustache and goatee.  It&#x27;s well made but the cutting blades are extremely small.  I don&#x27;t have a thick moustache or goatee and it still takes several passes to get everything even.  So many I lose count.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it if you have a thick, full beard.  It does have a precise adjustment and good battery life.  The use of this device can be time consuming.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the charger. I lost it and it cost me the same as a new trimmer to replace it. It takes too much space in the sink. I would rather have one with just a cord to plug.</li>
            <li> Proved to be nearly useless.</li>
            <li> After about one year of use, the guard will not attach back into the trimmer.  For whatever reason the clips holding it in don&#x27;t work anymore. No idea why this started happening; one day it was working, next time I tried to use it, it was broken. A bit disappointed that it only lasted a year.</li>
            <li> This is a really good rechargeable beard trimmer intended for regularly maintained beard or facial hair.  The cutting dial allows for highly precise length adjustments, from 1mm to 10mm, in half millimeter intervals along the way.  So if you&#x27;re really particular about the exact length of your beard, then this one should give all the control anyone needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charging base is nice - just place the shaver into it and a red LED lights up letting you know it&#x27;s charging (FYI - the red LED does Not go out once fully charged, it just stays illuminated the whole time the shaver is in the base.)  The base is a perfect cradle for this shaver; it doesn&#x27;t needlessly cling to the shaver, so it can easily be removed and placed back with one hand.  The metallic blue shaft and silver accent gives the shaver a chic look.  And most importantly, it does cut quite well and is relatively silent.  I did notice the blades don&#x27;t have quite the same, rock steady cutting power of a plugged in shaver, but that&#x27;s to be expected with most rechargeable battery shavers.  But for regular use, it&#x27;s a fair trade off to not have a cord dangling in my way.  This will probably be my go-to shaver for regular maintenance.  But if I ever decide to mow down to a goatee, or let my beard get a bit too long between touch-ups, then I&#x27;d probably reach for the full cutting power of my plug-in Wahl, since it can mow through anything with relative ease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure the wet/dry feature of this shaver is very meaningful; those are best for a clean shave and easy cleanup.  But for facial hair maintenance, the wet/dry thing is pretty much a meaningless gimmick; you&#x27;ll pluck as many hairs as you trim if trying to touch-up a wet beard, and rinsing longer stubble off the blades wont be as effective as just brushing them off.  (Yes, a small brush is included.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line - this is a really good beard trimmer that feels nice in the hand, and offers excellent precision and cutting ability for regularly maintained beards.for regularly maintained beards.</li>
            <li> Ergonomically designed and much more quiet than the Remington.  Nice touch making the ends of the prongs rounded so an accidental poke doesn&#x27;t smart.  Multiple-settings are easy to adjust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t tried it yet, in the shower, but a nice option indeed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gave it 4 stars because occasionally there&#x27;s a hair-pull...but that could be its operator!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased with this trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice job, Panasonic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From my husband who is its main user and long-time beard grower:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have owned several hair and beard trimmers over the years and this is my favorite.  Not the cheapest one, but the best one.&lt;br /&gt;The 19 position adjustable ring is precise and smooth.  The ergonomic design makes it easy to hold for maximum control.&lt;br /&gt;The trim control comb is rounded so as not to gouge or grab the skin like some of the other ones I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t comment on the battery life because I have not had the need to recharge it since the first 24hr charge.&lt;br /&gt;Have used it at least 6 time and it is still going strong.&lt;br /&gt;The ER-BG40-S is the quietest trimmer I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only used it as a &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; trimmer so no comment on performance as a wet trimmer.  Sorry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The included charging stand is solid and attractive on the counter.&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint would be the blade gaps are a little more narrow than my Remington so I sometimes have to make an extra pass on those tricky areas.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend the ER-BG40-S but deducted one star to the narrow blade openings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Am now using the Panasonic ER-BG60-K (Oct 2015) - which is even better than the ER-BG40.</li>
            <li> Comb design is not good. It does not function smoothly and it is hard to disassemble to clean.  It broke after 3 uses.</li>
            <li> Bought it as a gift for my boyfriend and he loves it!</li>
            <li> Great trimmer, light and very quite.  Make sure you double check the settings, I used to have a beard, made my son cry, my dog bark, my wife says it will grow back:-(</li>
            <li> Does the job.  Battery life is really good.  Easy to clean, adjust and cuts very cleanly.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my 20 year old son who loves his beard. That being said he needed to keep it trimmed! He likes it longer and was afraid this might not be able to keep it the length he wanted it. To his amazement, it fit the bill perfectly!. He was able to trim it up and will be able to maintain the length he prefers. As for shaving body hair, he doesn&#x27;t do that so I can only rate this for beard trimming. It works great for that</li>
            <li> Very quiet operation and I like the multiple height adjustment. I previously bought the panasonic wet/dry shaver and the quality very good.</li>
            <li> Very well made.. Does a really good job!</li>
            <li> No power whatsoever, reviews misled me to purchase this item. It does clip well but very little power. It does not feel comfortable when trying to get a 3.5 trim. It didn&#x27;t snag but felt wimpy.</li>
            <li> purchased this for my son for Christmas.  He loves it. He likes to have a neatly trimmed beard and with this razor and all of the attachments it is easy to be well groomed all of the time.</li>
            <li> Have that&#x27;s used the dry mode thus far, but it&#x27;s an excellent and very exact trimmer. Set it to \\&quot;3\\&quot; and it got my beard trimmed in a fraction of the time it used to take.. As it turned out, \\&quot;3\\&quot; is too short for my taste, but the machine was plowing through my beard like there&#x27;s no tomorrow. Excellent product! Only, minor grief: blade needs to get a drop of oil each time it&#x27;s used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, that&#x27;s not really a big deal, and probably no different from other, similar products.&lt;br /&gt;Also would like it if the charging light could switch from red to green when it&#x27;s fully charged, but mine just doesn&#x27;t. Anyway, this is a good trimmer, for little money, and it gets the job done!</li>
            <li> I trim all my hair including my head &amp; I have been through plenty of hair trimmers. Its portable, fits cofortably in your hand and is very accurate &amp; sharp.  Love it, bought one for my son &amp; he loves it.</li>
            <li> I like this alot. I can&#x27;t tell you how many of these thing I have had over the years. I have thrown them all away. None were worth the time.&lt;br /&gt;This is more powerful and has a dial setting that comes off for close cutting. Not a bunch of clip on depth attachments.&lt;br /&gt;You can use in it the shower and wash it with hot water after using it so its always nice and clean. Good product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all the panasonic series and i only like this one&lt;br /&gt;I use it for my beard. except for charging time, it&#x27;s good</li>
            <li> The charging station is pretty cool. The adjustment feature works great. The big problem is the blade is very low quality. Even on the first shave it snags and pulls. Would&#x27;t recommend</li>
            <li> Works well, just need to clean consistently</li>
            <li> This is a great trimmer.  It replaces my 20-year-old Remington and it is SUCH an improvement.  Read the reviews that complained about the dial being visible from front and back and, while that is true, it doesn&#x27;t take a genius to figure out which side you should read!  I do not use my trimmer in the shower so the oiling isn&#x27;t a big deal.  I think it&#x27;s a great value.</li>
            <li> Worked great for a couple of months and then the battery would no longer hold a charge.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a couple of times, but it is so far the best facial trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used.  I&#x27;ve used Norelco in the past, and they were pretty decent, but I had to make several passes over my beard to get all the hair even.  With the Panasonic Milano ER-GB40-S, it takes two passes at the most.  You just have to make sure you go against the grain, especially my beard hairs go in all different directions.  From what I can see, there are two things this beard trimmer has over the competition.  First, the adjustable comb that has 19 length settings.  Sure, other facial trimmers have adjustable combs, but they&#x27;re often flimsy and interfere with the hair making contact with the blades.  Second, there&#x27;s a small groove in the comb in which the hair is not obstructed by the blade.  This simple addition is mind-blowingly effective in making sure that the comb keeps the hair at the selected level without interfering with it&#x27;s contact with the blades.  The only CON is that you have to take apart the blade assembly to clean and oil it.  And, according to the manual/instructions, you&#x27;re supposed to do this after you use it each time.  Despite that, I&#x27;m a life-long Panasonic facial trimmer user now.  I can confidently state that I will always own this trimmer or the closest version Panasonic has to offer well into the future, because my beard has never looked this good before with so little effort.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even finish one shave of my not-that-heavy beard with about 5 days growth. Ever wonder why items go on Lightning Deal? Perhaps I should wonder that more often.  I usually just eat the cost of a personal care item like this if it doesn&#x27;t work, but this is so bad, I simply must return it out of principle.</li>
            <li> This clipper is just okay.  It&#x27;s nice that it can handle being wet and the base is nice for automatic recharging.  The clipper seems underpowered for doing sideburns, the attachment for adjusting how much to cut is cheap plastic.  I worry about breaking it.  You need to pull it off in order to do close clipping and then get it into the right slots to put it back in.  I&#x27;ve only had it for about a week, and I&#x27;ll update if anything significant happens.</li>
