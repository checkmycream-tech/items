            <li> this powder sucks the moisture right out of your skin.  </li>
            <li> Feels like rough gritty baby powder, does NOT blend and leaves skin dry looking.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin so this product doesn&#x27;t suit me one bit.</li>
            <li> Just bit goes a long way, especially with a fluffy brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There is not a whole lot of color to it - but thats expected.</li>
            <li> I use this for a setting powder and like it because it doesn&#x27;t make me look so pale like white powders can do.</li>
            <li> the other review mentioned airbrush quality.. which is indeed correct.</li>
            <li> It is a little dark compared to the NYX &amp;#34;Stay</li>
            <li> With this product, I can use a little and my skin will stay matte for hours!</li>
            <li> Not good makeup.</li>

            <li> This is my all time favorite nyx product.has great coverage</li>
            <li> This stuff is perfect, when I don&#x27;t use it I can feel the difference! This stuff is perfect to use after you finish your powder or liquid face makeup, it really sets it and it isn&#x27;t sparkly like a lot of powders tend to be. I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff! It sets your foundation great! I was pretty hesitant about buying this product because its for light to medium skin, I have very very light, ivory skin. It is a little dark compared to the NYX &amp;#34;Stay matte but not flat&amp;#34; foundation in Ivory, but it sets very well!</li>
            <li> this is a fabulous setting powder. There is not a whole lot of color to it - but thats expected. This is to go over your main coverage makeup. Looks very natural. I would suggest definitely using moisturizer - this powder sucks the moisture right out of your skin.  Overall - great! feels light and soft on your face</li>
            <li> The best loose powder I&#x27;ve ever tried!! I have oily skin that never used to stay matte for more than an hour after applying powder. With this product, I can use a little and my skin will stay matte for hours! It&#x27;s not at all cakey and it&#x27;s feather-light. Would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I am in love with this product. It settles my make up nicely, it&#x27;s very pigmented and fine, all around a great product. Wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if I ended up ordering this again once I run out.</li>
            <li> Great stuff....only need a little.  It goes on easy, and with a good kabuki brush you look almost airbrushed.  Good price point for the quality.  NYX is now my brand of choice</li>
            <li> But please wait until it is at a reduced price. I am a major makeup junkie and Have a lot of experience with various brands; NYX being at the top of my list. But not this product. the other review mentioned airbrush quality.. which is indeed correct. But in the sun, it looks like you have dipped a powder puff in finely grated dirt and puffed it on your face. you get the same treatment after about two hours.. and if your oily, like me.. you will have blotched marks all over your face. I apply with a rather expensive mac brush; and it applies my other powders perfectly. Try at your own risk.</li>
            <li> Love this and use it every day!!</li>
            <li> I use this for a setting powder and like it because it doesn&#x27;t make me look so pale like white powders can do. Just bit goes a long way, especially with a fluffy brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pigment is perfect for my coloring.</li>
            <li> Might have to reapply if going out at night after work.  Great product for a great price.</li>
            <li> Very light weight and smooth finish, gives you that flawless radiant look.</li>
            <li> Best setting powder over all!</li>
            <li> Great light powder works wonders. Stays on all day and doesn&#x27;t clog pores. Blends easily with my other mineral powders. Will definitely be coming back</li>
            <li> I have dry skin so this product doesn&#x27;t suit me one bit. It came in good timing however and the price is nice. It may work for someone with oily or normal skin.</li>
            <li> This is a great light powder for everyday use.  The color was great and the cost is also great!</li>
            <li> Love this. Totally translucent; sets well.</li>
            <li> Feels like rough gritty baby powder, does NOT blend and leaves skin dry looking. Not good makeup. Does not come with a powder brush either.</li>
