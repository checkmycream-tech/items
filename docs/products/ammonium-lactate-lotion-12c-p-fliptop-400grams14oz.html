            <li>It&#x27;s alright but not as good.</li>
            <li>It serves it&#x27;s purpose which is moisturizing the skin, but it does not remove the scales from skin as good as the amlactin.</li>

            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have the most pleasant smell but it&#x27;s not greasy and softens skin.</li>

            <li>Best price I could find for a product that works very well.</li>
            <li>For best results, i put it on my hands and feet, then I put socks and cotton gloves on and it really restored my skin within a week or so.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s got a nice anti-aging effect as well.  </li>
            <li>(I am testing it on just one to see how effective it is).  </li>
            <li>I have tried soooo many lotions and this one is the first one I am really satified with!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>I am very pleased to be able to buy this lotion on line.</li>
            <li>It is awesome and more reasonably prices on this site.  </li>
            <li>Works great and reasonably priced!</li>
            <li>has a very light smell of ammonium, but that didn&#x27;t bother me from wearing the cream.  </li>
            <li>Well... I&#x27;m glad she didn&#x27;t</li>
            <li>:)     </li>
            <li>I have been using this lotion for years, and it&#x27;s more convenient to purchase now that it is OTC.  </li>
            <li>So glad I was able to find</li>
            <li>The most affordable option for purchasing lactic acid lotion intended to treat keratosis pilaris.</li>
            <li>and im in love...</li>
            <li>Worked well, and I am pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>i love it.</li>
            <li>My doc also prescribed this, and after a week, 2x a day, my feet look much better.</li>
            <li>My feet love this lotion.</li>
            <li>The smell dissipates after a while or maybe my nose just doesn&#x27;t smell it any more.</li>
            <li>Great product - much cheaper than the $40 co-payment I had to pay for a &amp;#34;perscription&amp;#34; for this.  </li>
            <li>It was better than anything I have tried.</li>
            <li>I gave this lotion a 5 star rating as I have been using this product for many years.  </li>
            <li>I was pleased.  </li>
            <li>For her it is a five stars :)</li>
            <li>will buy more when needed.</li>
            <li>I have found that some batches are more fragrant than others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll more bottles for sure.</li>
            <li>LOVE HOW THIS STUFF MAKES MY SKIN FEELS.</li>
            <li>The price here is better than in stores.  </li>
            <li>allergic to many creams and perfumes.  </li>
            <li>I kept using it thinking that eventually it would make my skin look better</li>
            <li>Also since I would have to pay for return postage it would be more money out of my pocket.</li>
            <li>I got it because I read that it works excellent on getting rid of back zits, which I get sometimes from all the sweating and working out that I do, and genetics, but I haven&#x27;t seen it help at all with that.</li>
            <li>Okay.....</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>love this item will order more</li>
            <li>And there is no funky odor, it smells like most unscented lotions.</li>
            <li>But for the love of god you should NOT USE THIS LOTION.</li>
            <li>I have given one bottle to a friend who said it was a better moisturizer than the $80 formula she was using.  </li>
            <li>I leave my skin damp and then apply it so it has the added benefit of even more moisture.  </li>
            <li>My husband uses the ammonium lactate lotion for itchy legs in the winter months.&lt;br /&gt;Has worked better than anything else he has tried.</li>
            <li>I know most of you think it doesn&#x27;t leave a smell, but it does...</li>
            <li>but I like Amylactin better</li>
            <li>Better to use at night i think.</li>
            <li>Of several I have tried, this is the best.</li>
            <li>So glad my dermatologist recommended it.</li>
            <li>FANTASTIC!</li>
            <li>I have tried a lactic, aquaglycolic, alpha hydrox, as well as many Eucerin products.</li>
            <li>It works like magic on my calloused heals as well.</li>
            <li>The package is generic, but the product is the best quality, not to mention price, I have found.</li>
            <li>I subscribed to subscribe and save on this for even better savings.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Love the results from this...and the price.  </li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>Be sure to wear sunscreen and keep this out of your eyes.</li>
            <li>does, better than using pumice which makes the skin look more ragged.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion.  </li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>Works as well as name brand costing much more.</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>I did notice a difference, but found that just being in the sun works way better.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure</li>
            <li>Great lotion for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>It is pretty sticky, so plan on hanging out for a good 20 before you go anywhere.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a pleasant smell but it certainly does the job.</li>
            <li>I recieved the name through my dermatologist, picked up the product and found it the best dry skin cream ever!&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>This is one of the best products I&#x27;ve used for itchy, dry skin.  </li>
            <li>Best lotion ever for dry skin.  </li>
            <li>Have used this product for years and it is excellent for dry hardened skin.  </li>
            <li>Works wonderfully as a body lotion, but too strong for the face, as to be expected.  </li>
            <li>I received the product from seller very quickly and it was just as promised.  </li>
            <li>I received this product very quickly and it was packaged well.</li>
            <li>I want to assure anyone who might be put off by the smell that is not that strong and dissipates within a couple minutes once applied.</li>
            <li>It is a bit too strong for my chest and decolletage when used full-strength, but I add it to another lotion for that area.</li>
            <li>continue to use this product and strongly recommend it to those who are suffering from severe itching or dryness of the skin.</li>
            <li>I think, I had high expectation after reading the good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>I was very excited to get this big of a bottle for a great price.</li>
            <li>First used this kind of lotion when I was prescribed to use it.  </li>
            <li>This product is just as good quality as AmLactin (actually, I saw better results with this product than with the brand name product), and at a MUCH better price per ounce.</li>
            <li>this product is best for my super dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;after</li>
            <li>Ammonium Lactate is very good for scaly dry skin, but I also want to add (for any fellow sufferers)that</li>
            <li>Very good on dry skin.</li>
            <li>Works very good for my dry skin.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, fine.</li>
            <li>A very good lotion for very dry skin.  </li>
            <li>This is a huge help.  </li>
            <li>I started making my own products when I became more conscious of all the harmful ingredients in things, so I think I have developed the perfect natural replacement for this product for</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t notice a huge difference with mine,</li>
            <li>Fabulous moisturizer that used to be prescribed by my dermatologist.</li>
            <li>Then, realized it&#x27;s available over-the-counter as well.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The product is advertised as fragrance free.  </li>
            <li>It is also light and odorless.  </li>
            <li>Of course, now it is available over the counter in the lotion form, which this product is.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m happy with it and would recommend.</li>
            <li>great price on this item that I use daily.  </li>
            <li>I put it on after my shower then cover it with a light layer of vasoline.</li>
            <li>This was the lowest price with free shipping</li>
            <li>Now my feet are as smooth as can be.&lt;br /&gt;Seller was beyond prompt in delivery and product came sooner than the anticipated time.</li>
            <li>It is scent free.</li>
            <li>Overall great product, and just bought another pack of it.</li>
            <li>Ammonium lactate equivalent to 12% lactic acid, cetyl alcohol, fragrance, glycerin, glyceryl stearate, laureth-4, light mineral oil, magnesium aluminum silicate, methylcellulose, methylparaben, PEG-100 stearate, polyoxyl 40 stearate, propylene glycol, propylparaben, and purified water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Needs to be used along with a good lotion to keep skin soft and</li>
            <li>The product is great, they ship it fast and very well packaged.</li>
            <li>This is a generic brand, but it is excellent and worked very well.  </li>
            <li>This brand is far more effective in moisturing.</li>
            <li>There is not a question here at all) that it was still everything the ammonium lactate had touched, because there&lt;br /&gt;IS NO WAY TO GET RID OF THE SMELL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had to throw out thousands upon thousands of dollars worth of stuff because there is quite literally no way to clean it (that I&#x27;ve been able to find.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is absolutely the best for dry skin and cracked heels and elbows.</li>
            <li>This is the absolute best lotion for dry, cracked, scaly skin.  </li>
            <li>I have very fair sensitive skin inherited from my red headed grand mother</li>
            <li>definitely worth it!</li>
            <li>Even just once-daily use leaves a significant improvement.</li>
            <li>so I can cut it with a nice scented lotion and smell like a normal girl.</li>
            <li>I was satisfied when I ordered the first time.  </li>
            <li>Well worth it!</li>
            <li>So far, I am very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>Originally received the lotion as a prescription from a dermatologist.  </li>
            <li>It is a great exfoliant for dry skin.</li>
            <li>This is a great lotion paired with a dry body brush.</li>
            <li>Great for dry skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been great on my dry, flaky legs!  </li>
            <li>Same good results as the original product for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>Keeps my feet nice and soft ^_^ ....</li>
            <li>Use this to keep your feet nice and soft.</li>
            <li>I can slather oil-based lotions on until I&#x27;m fairly dripping with it, but there&#x27;s no lasting effect.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t tell you if it works because I couldn&#x27;t stand putting it on my skin for more than 2 days straight.</li>
            <li>This is a good product at a more reasonable price than when locally seen on the shelves..</li>
            <li>I love this product because it works, and it&#x27;s reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind the burning as it&#x27;s not terribly bad.</li>
            <li>Not a bad product</li>
            <li>Wonderful product for dry sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and in neat, undamaged packaging.</li>
            <li>I believe this lotion used to be marketed as Lac-hydrin and was available by prescription only, so I was thrilled to find it on this site.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t expect quick results, but I&#x27;m hopeful it will improve as the years go by.</li>
            <li>The smell takes some getting used to but fades quickly after application.  </li>
            <li>No complaints whatever ... quick delivery as promised.</li>
            <li>This ones works the best on the keratosis pilaris areas I have at the back of my arms and upper thighs.</li>
            <li>At first it made my skin really smooth</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping!</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s easy to apply to large area of your body.</li>
            <li>This is a very nice lotion that works well for softening skin, especially dry winter skin.</li>
            <li>Excellent for dry skin, non grease at all, You can see the different just in two or three days!</li>
            <li>It smells a bit like Elmer&#x27;s glue right out of the bottle, but the smell quickly disappears.</li>
            <li>We are very grateful that it is available now without a prescription and</li>
            <li>Works great on my feet and dried up heels.</li>
            <li>It is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>They say it makes a person more sensitive to sun, but I haven&#x27;t noticed that.  </li>
            <li>It feels similar to the kind of burning sensation you get when you put alcohol in a wound.</li>
            <li>All in all, so far, I am pleased.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling nice for the entire day.  </li>
            <li>Basically it made my skin really soft but did not make it look better at all.</li>
            <li>Nice to have a cream that actually will work for a couple days</li>
            <li>I found the product to be very mild and highly moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>It quickly became apparent (and yes I am 100% sure.</li>
            <li>if you exfoliate first even mildly, it will sting.</li>
            <li>Prescribed by my m.d. ten years ago, now over the counter and very easy to access.</li>
            <li>Works great on my old lady feet, nothing else gets rid the dry scaley skin like this</li>
            <li>It has been great in getting rid of the tiny red bumps on the backs of my arms.</li>
            <li>Ordered it again because it worked great and lasted the entire winter with daily use (as directed.)  </li>
            <li>the price on Amazon is very reasonable.  </li>
            <li>it helps my skin condition very much.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Better price same quality.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li>Was so glad to find the same size bottle, identical ingredients in this lotion that&lt;br /&gt;was</li>
            <li>exactly as I was needing.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li>Everyone is recommending this lately and it works as great as they say.  </li>
            <li>First review was rejected, don&#x27;t know why.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more of a rich cream than a lotion compared to the other lactic acid lotions I have ordered.</li>
            <li>This was a better price for a larger bottle.  </li>
            <li>The first time I put on my heels</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have used this company and will not try again</li>
            <li>Additionally, many of them left me feeling greasy or slimy.  </li>
            <li>but Im going back to Alpha hydrox Gylcolic acid lotion because its better in terms of moisturizing and bettering my skin,</li>
            <li>When I first asked a doctor what I could use for my condition</li>
            <li>If you scrub the affected area and persistently apply the lotion every day after a shower, your skin will definitely get better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting married in October</li>
            <li>I first started using it 25 years ago when a dermatologist prescribed it for me.  </li>
            <li>Decided to check Amazon first.  </li>
            <li>, seems to hydrate more and last longer when applied before you to bed.</li>
            <li>As soon as i get the itch and the first signs of eczema start appearing, I apply this product for couple of days and its gone.</li>
            <li>so there is even more of an adjustment period off the bat; for those unfamiliar with these type of lotions it may increase the likelihood of being put off by the initial feel (hang in there - they work!).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried neumerous products for my KP, and many left my arms feeling greasy.  </li>
            <li>This lotion seems pretty moisturizing, although maybe a tad sticky if you over apply.</li>
            <li>Also diminishes those pesky bumps that seem to love my upper arms.  </li>
            <li>I admit, I haven&#x27;t been using it religiously, but now that summer is here, I am beginning to use it more often.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m absolutely giddy over finding this!</li>
            <li>I am very thankful to have found this!</li>
            <li>It immediately soothes the skin, and the soothing action remains for a good long while.</li>
            <li>The product do a good job takes a few weeks to work.</li>
            <li>This product is great for extremely dry and cracked skin, especially for your feet.</li>
            <li>Been using for a few weeks now and it has worked the best of any product that I have tried on dry skin.</li>
            <li>Great stuff for dry feet, especially when you become a senior citizen.  </li>
            <li>My dermatologist recommended this lotion and it works great for my dry skin, especially in the winter.  </li>
            <li>I have tried numerous other products but in my opinion, this is the best by far.  </li>
            <li>i dont know if it will completely go away, but i am pleased with the improvement so far.</li>
            <li>the bottle is pretty large.</li>
            <li>the bottle sent to me is exactly the same, contains the 3 parabens -- returning this product for full refund!</li>
            <li>I bought this because I saw a lot of positive reviews about how it helps with keratosis pilaris.</li>
            <li>Does not take a lot for positive results.  </li>
            <li>I hope the results improve my skin tone even more long term.</li>
            <li>first time using this product, really helps with my complexion.</li>
            <li>The title pretty much says it all.  </li>
            <li>We have been married 41 years and this is the first time her feet looks normal.</li>
            <li>While this hasn&#x27;t cleared it up 100%, it&#x27;s much better than with anything else I&#x27;ve tried, and my arms aren&#x27;t dry</li>
            <li>I am 60 years old and my skin looks really good, almost no wrinkles, dark spots or enlarged pores.</li>
            <li>if I can&#x27;t get the scent out with a good airing of the mattress topper and a heavy dose of baking soda, I guess I will have to get rid of the mattress topper and get a new one</li>
            <li>Love this, really helps with dry skin.</li>
            <li>finally realized what exactly it was (I couldn&#x27;t tell originally, because the smell takes a couple weeks to appear, and again, I couldn&#x27;t smell it anymore), so I washed and drycleaned EVERYTHING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Once it&#x27;s absorbed into the skin it does feel sticky so putting on tight jeans or leggings is more of a challenge.</li>
            <li>It can sting a little when you put it on, especially on freshly shaved legs, but that&#x27;s temporary.  </li>
            <li>It was prescribed by my doctor for a foot problem and works really well.</li>
            <li>because now I have found it online and just as reasonable as my RX co-pay.  </li>
            <li>I use it head to toe because it is reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>Works fast at exfoliating your skin, make your skin look smoother.</li>
            <li>It does that very well.</li>
            <li>when I saw this on Amazon for a much cheaper price - their answer?  </li>
            <li>It is much thicker.</li>
            <li>I also gently file the skin on the heels for mainatance.  </li>
            <li>Really helps with my scalpy skin.</li>
            <li>This creme worked very well.  </li>
            <li>SO MUCH NICER ALL AROUND.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t do much for my Keratosis Pillaris</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not working at this time and have to watch how much I spend.</li>
            <li>The product I really wanted to purchase - a Le Edge stainless steel exfoliator I found out was out of stock.</li>
            <li>I was able to find this on a different web site for a few $ more with NO shipping charges and took my payment over the phone.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works.  </li>
            <li>I personally don&#x27;t really like the smell it has, and it can rub off onto your sheets and clothes leaving that scent on it.</li>
            <li>This product really helps.</li>
            <li>This product really works.  </li>
            <li>( I purchased the necessarily $35 in products to qualify for the free shipping.  </li>
            <li>I recommend it highly!</li>
            <li>dont care much for the smell....</li>
            <li>it is better than any other product in this category that I have tried.  </li>
            <li>finally become fresh!</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t seem to help any better than other products I have used.</li>
            <li>I think it probably affects some people more than others (possibly due to the acid/alkaline level of your skin, etc.)</li>
            <li>Burns a little when you put it on after shaving, but makes you super soft and smooth!</li>
            <li>Apply in small amounts, get amazing results.</li>
            <li>There is no offensive sour odor like I experienced with other brands.</li>
            <li>And, you can use this lotion and still use your regular body lotion or perfume if you want you skin to smell sweet.  </li>
            <li>This product makes good skin look and feel better and it can make some types of bad skin look and feel normal!</li>
            <li>I cannot live without this stuff!</li>
            <li>this is slightly different than the original formulation by Upsher-Smith, but worth trying because of its low price.</li>
            <li>I was given a bottle of Ammonium Lactate 12% and after using it only 2 times my skin is so soft and smooth, and all signs of the Psoriasis are all but gone.</li>
            <li>A similiar lotion at my local store cost more than this for a much smaller bottle.</li>
            <li>This is the second time I have purchased this product online, it is the same product that sells at the pharmacy but for much, much more.</li>
            <li>it is actually cheaper online than in most local stores.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only thing that works on my feet, which are smooth and supple at 64 years old.  </li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s main purpose), and one star off for the scent.</li>
            <li>For me, this product didn&#x27;t work and actually made my bumps more red and noticeable.</li>
            <li>The product is bit smelly, but it seems to be the only thing that works with my mild eczema.  </li>
            <li>As I get older, so does my skin.</li>
            <li>If nothing else, it seems like a decent lotion and</li>
            <li>if I actually used it once or twice a day it would actually be even more beneficial.</li>
            <li>It seems easier to apply &amp; takes less product right after a warm shower rather than applying when your skin is completely dry.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>Would recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>the doctor gave me a rx for but at a highly reduced price.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I can highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It works just as well (for me maybe even a little better) and as it is a bit thicker than classic Amlactin</li>
            <li>THIS BRAND IS A LITTLE MORE THICK, BUT IT STILL SPREADS NICELY.</li>
            <li>I even use it on a regular basis sometimes, because it leaves my skin super soft!</li>
            <li>The product really keeps my skin soft.</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t great when you put it on, but it is sticky and I found it was difficult to get dressed if I put it on after my shower, so then I would put it on before I went to sleep.  </li>
            <li>It really helps my 51 year old skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll try it for a few more months</li>
            <li>But after using this lotion in place of Amlactin for a few weeks I&#x27;m quite pleased and will continue to purchase this instead.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to use much of this product either, so it will last pretty well.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend, but use with caution if you have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>With regular use, the lotion works like magic to get rid of scaly, dry skin, and keratosis pilaris on legs and backs of arms.</li>
            <li>I new</li>
            <li>Fantastic moisturizer - especially in dry winter months and in summer after exposure to sun.  </li>
            <li>My Dermatologist recommended this as I have extraordinary dry skin.  </li>
            <li>this lotion takes the itch out immediately and heals super dry skin.  </li>
            <li>The only down sides are that it&#x27;s pricey and it has a strong medicinal or chemical odor when I first put it on...</li>
            <li>It keeps these \\&quot;rougher\\&quot; skin areas very soft.</li>
            <li>Good, I had used a couple of ammonium lotion but nowadays, I usually buy this lotion for my dry skin.</li>
            <li>This lotion really works on dry skin, better than any other over-the-counter product.  </li>
            <li>I make sure to use a sunscreen year round!  </li>
            <li>My beautiful wife suffers from skin asthma.  </li>
            <li>This is the exact same thing!  </li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve also been really scrubbing the areas of my arms with the bumps with a rough sponge in the shower) but it does seem very promising.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Lac-Hydrin esque products for nearly 20 years, and I can&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
            <li>initially given to me as an RX, price was great as yours was less than half the&lt;br /&gt;price of the RX one.  </li>
            <li>It is not very viscous and soaks in adequately.</li>
            <li>I have try lot of different kind lotion in the past, nothing work like this one.</li>
            <li>Same as AmLactin, but more product for less money.</li>
            <li>My skin is so soft and smooth now, and it appears to be helping slightly with the texture and appearance of some of my stretch marks.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true that they didn&#x27;t add in any perfumes to give it a flowery scent and such, however, that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s &amp;#34;scent&amp;#34; free.</li>
            <li>Many people have this condition - small white bumps primarily on the back of arms (can be on back, legs, face also) -</li>
            <li>Most heel remedies are simply petroleum jelly and do soften a bit, but this Ammonium Lactate actually worked and with regular application continues to help my rough, crusty heels look a little more presentable.</li>
            <li>this truly works to clear up Keratosis Pilaris.  </li>
            <li>Ammonium Lactate in this 12% formula works like a charm to clear up the bumps.  </li>
            <li>I bought this to clear up the Kertosis Pilaris on the backs of my arms.  </li>
            <li>So far I have been using it daily for 1 1/2 months and with continued use it really does make my skin feel softer and smoother.  </li>
            <li>Used after bathing with a sensitive skin soap, it has&lt;br /&gt;helped</li>
            <li>The bottle said not to get it on one&#x27;s lips or the corners by one&#x27;s nose, but I do, and it causes no trouble.</li>
            <li>This creams makes your skin so soft.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin, I would NOT recommend this product.</li>
            <li>definately not the same stuff you get by prescription, very sticky, after using it for a week</li>
            <li>The last time I recommended they correct it ( has not been done) and be  much more careful about such descriptions.</li>
            <li>I use this to keep my feet soft in the summer.</li>
            <li>I also use it on my face, neck, and chest (although not every day, that skin is too sensitive) to counteract the signs of aging.</li>
            <li>It has faded my stretch marks and given me silky smooth skin, and I don&#x27;t even do it everyday.</li>
            <li>Hence, my crusty heels have developed just like my dad&#x27;s did when he was alive.</li>
            <li>Your skin will feel as soft as a baby</li>
            <li>This product plumps up my skin and gives it a soft touch.  </li>
            <li>Then this scent of urine developed in my room--even after changing the sheets, etc.  </li>
            <li>My skin already feels smoother &amp; the redness &amp; bumps have almost completely gone away.</li>
            <li>Makes them soft after a couple applications.</li>
            <li>My dermatologist finally prescribed 12% ammonium lactate cream in a squeeze tube a few years ago, and it was better than anything else I had tried.  </li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin, and it caused some little red bumps on my arm at first, but those quickly went away.</li>
            <li>This was first referred to me by a podiatrist for my dry, cracked feet.</li>
            <li>A pharmacist told me once that a little goes a long way, and rubbing it in well gets better results that using a lot of it.  </li>
            <li>I find that I&#x27;m able to use less of it overall which further extends its use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>However, in list of ingreidents on Amazon, water is first, whereas, on my current product it is the second.</li>
            <li>I find this to be a little tacky after use, but there was no bad smell, which was a bonus.</li>
            <li>Only downside: leaves skin sticky when the humidity is high.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone with a similar problem.</li>
            <li>You left off all of the parabens that are added to this product (which I had to go on other sites which list the full set of ingredients to find).</li>
            <li>This is very helpful for dry itchy skin,.  </li>
            <li>It really helped my dry, cracked hand and heels.</li>
            <li>If you have dry skin problems, you will not believe how fast the results will show up.  </li>
            <li>It worked very well on my dry skin</li>
            <li>One reviewer complained about the smell and it is true that this lotion does not smell like your normal perfumed body lotions.  </li>
            <li>My skin is starting to feel as soft as a baby&#x27;s butt!</li>
            <li>Other than that, it works pretty well on my bumpy skin, when used sparingly.</li>
            <li>I am willing to live with the smell because it is one of the few things that works on my kp.</li>
            <li>The lotion has a very slight chemical odor that dissipates quickly.  </li>
            <li>But as far as it&#x27;s moisturizing ability, I guess I can&#x27;t really say that I notice it being any better or worse than just about any other moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>I, as a general rule, don&#x27;t write reviews.</li>
            <li>I have dry skin that requires this location, particularly after I work out, work up a sweat and take a shower.</li>
            <li>but I can barely stand the smell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been doing is using a soft loofa in the shower &amp; exfoliate the problem areas to open up the pores.</li>
            <li>People normally guess my age at ten years younger than I am.</li>
            <li>After a short period of time feet are back to normal.  </li>
            <li>It helps tremendously on just dry sking, and extremely well&lt;br /&gt;on</li>
            <li>Because the bumps look a little like pimples, many sufferers try acne/pimple remedies, but those are of little use.  </li>
            <li>It does the exact same job as the other stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>highly recommend this to anyone with dry skin!</li>
            <li>It does have a unique smell and is slight sticky, but this is to be expected with any lactate lotion.</li>
            <li>It works great and less expensive than some of the bigger brands of face cream.  </li>
            <li>Helped clear up the tiny red bumps on my arms.</li>
            <li>Usually buy the pharmacutecial brand, but this is as good as the other, only costs less.  </li>
            <li>This lotion smwelles a little funny, but it works for the dryness of the skin, the price is correct, thank you</li>
            <li>The only criticism would be the less than stellar, somewhat medicinal smell.</li>
            <li>apparently-- smells identical, works the same.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this for a couple days so far, but I notice a big different in the red bumps on my leg</li>
            <li>I have dry sensitive skin on my arms and legs.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin and/or suffer with dry, chapped skin, this lotion is the answer!</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Good</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s alright but not as good.</li>
            <li> It serves it&#x27;s purpose which is moisturizing the skin, but it does not remove the scales from skin as good as the amlactin.</li>
            <li> Good deal.  </li>
            <li> Keeps my skin surprisingly moist.</li>
            <li> It was recommended to me by my dermatologist, so I knew it would be good.</li>
            <li> you just can&#x27;t smell it because you are in it all the time (and even good friends won&#x27;t tell you you smell like pee).  </li>

            <li> So glad I found it!</li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have the most pleasant smell but it&#x27;s not greasy and softens skin.</li>

            <li> Best price I could find for a product that works very well.</li>
            <li> For best results, i put it on my hands and feet, then I put socks and cotton gloves on and it really restored my skin within a week or so.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s got a nice anti-aging effect as well.  </li>
            <li> (I am testing it on just one to see how effective it is).  </li>
            <li> I have tried soooo many lotions and this one is the first one I am really satified with!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased to be able to buy this lotion on line.</li>
            <li> It is awesome and more reasonably prices on this site.  </li>
            <li> Works great and reasonably priced!</li>
            <li> has a very light smell of ammonium, but that didn&#x27;t bother me from wearing the cream.  </li>
            <li> Well... I&#x27;m glad she didn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> :)     </li>
            <li> I have been using this lotion for years, and it&#x27;s more convenient to purchase now that it is OTC.  </li>
            <li> So glad I was able to find</li>
            <li> The most affordable option for purchasing lactic acid lotion intended to treat keratosis pilaris.</li>
            <li> and im in love...</li>
            <li> Worked well, and I am pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> i love it.</li>
            <li> My doc also prescribed this, and after a week, 2x a day, my feet look much better.</li>
            <li> My feet love this lotion.</li>
            <li> The smell dissipates after a while or maybe my nose just doesn&#x27;t smell it any more.</li>
            <li> Great product - much cheaper than the $40 co-payment I had to pay for a &amp;#34;perscription&amp;#34; for this.  </li>
            <li> It was better than anything I have tried.</li>
            <li> I gave this lotion a 5 star rating as I have been using this product for many years.  </li>
            <li> I was pleased.  </li>
            <li> For her it is a five stars :)</li>
            <li> will buy more when needed.</li>
            <li> I have found that some batches are more fragrant than others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll more bottles for sure.</li>
            <li> LOVE HOW THIS STUFF MAKES MY SKIN FEELS.</li>
            <li> The price here is better than in stores.  </li>
            <li> allergic to many creams and perfumes.  </li>
            <li> I kept using it thinking that eventually it would make my skin look better</li>
            <li> Also since I would have to pay for return postage it would be more money out of my pocket.</li>
            <li> I got it because I read that it works excellent on getting rid of back zits, which I get sometimes from all the sweating and working out that I do, and genetics, but I haven&#x27;t seen it help at all with that.</li>
            <li> Okay.....</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> love this item will order more</li>
            <li> And there is no funky odor, it smells like most unscented lotions.</li>
            <li> But for the love of god you should NOT USE THIS LOTION.</li>
            <li> I have given one bottle to a friend who said it was a better moisturizer than the $80 formula she was using.  </li>
            <li> I leave my skin damp and then apply it so it has the added benefit of even more moisture.  </li>
            <li> My husband uses the ammonium lactate lotion for itchy legs in the winter months.&lt;br /&gt;Has worked better than anything else he has tried.</li>
            <li> I know most of you think it doesn&#x27;t leave a smell, but it does...</li>
            <li> but I like Amylactin better</li>
            <li> Better to use at night i think.</li>
            <li> Of several I have tried, this is the best.</li>
            <li> So glad my dermatologist recommended it.</li>
            <li> FANTASTIC!</li>
            <li> I have tried a lactic, aquaglycolic, alpha hydrox, as well as many Eucerin products.</li>
            <li> It works like magic on my calloused heals as well.</li>
            <li> The package is generic, but the product is the best quality, not to mention price, I have found.</li>
            <li> I subscribed to subscribe and save on this for even better savings.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Love the results from this...and the price.  </li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> Be sure to wear sunscreen and keep this out of your eyes.</li>
            <li> does, better than using pumice which makes the skin look more ragged.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion.  </li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> Works as well as name brand costing much more.</li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> I did notice a difference, but found that just being in the sun works way better.</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure</li>
            <li> Great lotion for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> It is pretty sticky, so plan on hanging out for a good 20 before you go anywhere.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a pleasant smell but it certainly does the job.</li>
            <li> I recieved the name through my dermatologist, picked up the product and found it the best dry skin cream ever!&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> This is one of the best products I&#x27;ve used for itchy, dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Best lotion ever for dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Have used this product for years and it is excellent for dry hardened skin.  </li>
            <li> Works wonderfully as a body lotion, but too strong for the face, as to be expected.  </li>
            <li> I received the product from seller very quickly and it was just as promised.  </li>
            <li> I received this product very quickly and it was packaged well.</li>
            <li> I want to assure anyone who might be put off by the smell that is not that strong and dissipates within a couple minutes once applied.</li>
            <li> It is a bit too strong for my chest and decolletage when used full-strength, but I add it to another lotion for that area.</li>
            <li> continue to use this product and strongly recommend it to those who are suffering from severe itching or dryness of the skin.</li>
            <li> I think, I had high expectation after reading the good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> I was very excited to get this big of a bottle for a great price.</li>
            <li> First used this kind of lotion when I was prescribed to use it.  </li>
            <li> This product is just as good quality as AmLactin (actually, I saw better results with this product than with the brand name product), and at a MUCH better price per ounce.</li>
            <li> this product is best for my super dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;after</li>
            <li> Ammonium Lactate is very good for scaly dry skin, but I also want to add (for any fellow sufferers)that</li>
            <li> Very good on dry skin.</li>
            <li> Works very good for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, fine.</li>
            <li> A very good lotion for very dry skin.  </li>
            <li> This is a huge help.  </li>
            <li> I started making my own products when I became more conscious of all the harmful ingredients in things, so I think I have developed the perfect natural replacement for this product for</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t notice a huge difference with mine,</li>
            <li> Fabulous moisturizer that used to be prescribed by my dermatologist.</li>
            <li> Then, realized it&#x27;s available over-the-counter as well.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The product is advertised as fragrance free.  </li>
            <li> It is also light and odorless.  </li>
            <li> Of course, now it is available over the counter in the lotion form, which this product is.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m happy with it and would recommend.</li>
            <li> great price on this item that I use daily.  </li>
            <li> I put it on after my shower then cover it with a light layer of vasoline.</li>
            <li> This was the lowest price with free shipping</li>
            <li> Now my feet are as smooth as can be.&lt;br /&gt;Seller was beyond prompt in delivery and product came sooner than the anticipated time.</li>
            <li> It is scent free.</li>
            <li> Overall great product, and just bought another pack of it.</li>
            <li> Ammonium lactate equivalent to 12% lactic acid, cetyl alcohol, fragrance, glycerin, glyceryl stearate, laureth-4, light mineral oil, magnesium aluminum silicate, methylcellulose, methylparaben, PEG-100 stearate, polyoxyl 40 stearate, propylene glycol, propylparaben, and purified water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Needs to be used along with a good lotion to keep skin soft and</li>
            <li> The product is great, they ship it fast and very well packaged.</li>
            <li> This is a generic brand, but it is excellent and worked very well.  </li>
            <li> This brand is far more effective in moisturing.</li>
            <li> There is not a question here at all) that it was still everything the ammonium lactate had touched, because there&lt;br /&gt;IS NO WAY TO GET RID OF THE SMELL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had to throw out thousands upon thousands of dollars worth of stuff because there is quite literally no way to clean it (that I&#x27;ve been able to find.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is absolutely the best for dry skin and cracked heels and elbows.</li>
            <li> This is the absolute best lotion for dry, cracked, scaly skin.  </li>
            <li> I have very fair sensitive skin inherited from my red headed grand mother</li>
            <li> definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> Even just once-daily use leaves a significant improvement.</li>
            <li> so I can cut it with a nice scented lotion and smell like a normal girl.</li>
            <li> I was satisfied when I ordered the first time.  </li>
            <li> Well worth it!</li>
            <li> So far, I am very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> Originally received the lotion as a prescription from a dermatologist.  </li>
            <li> It is a great exfoliant for dry skin.</li>
            <li> This is a great lotion paired with a dry body brush.</li>
            <li> Great for dry skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been great on my dry, flaky legs!  </li>
            <li> Same good results as the original product for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> Keeps my feet nice and soft ^_^ ....</li>
            <li> Use this to keep your feet nice and soft.</li>
            <li> I can slather oil-based lotions on until I&#x27;m fairly dripping with it, but there&#x27;s no lasting effect.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t tell you if it works because I couldn&#x27;t stand putting it on my skin for more than 2 days straight.</li>
            <li> This is a good product at a more reasonable price than when locally seen on the shelves..</li>
            <li> I love this product because it works, and it&#x27;s reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind the burning as it&#x27;s not terribly bad.</li>
            <li> Not a bad product</li>
            <li> Wonderful product for dry sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly and in neat, undamaged packaging.</li>
            <li> I believe this lotion used to be marketed as Lac-hydrin and was available by prescription only, so I was thrilled to find it on this site.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t expect quick results, but I&#x27;m hopeful it will improve as the years go by.</li>
            <li> The smell takes some getting used to but fades quickly after application.  </li>
            <li> No complaints whatever ... quick delivery as promised.</li>
            <li> This ones works the best on the keratosis pilaris areas I have at the back of my arms and upper thighs.</li>
            <li> At first it made my skin really smooth</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping!</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s easy to apply to large area of your body.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice lotion that works well for softening skin, especially dry winter skin.</li>
            <li> Excellent for dry skin, non grease at all, You can see the different just in two or three days!</li>
            <li> It smells a bit like Elmer&#x27;s glue right out of the bottle, but the smell quickly disappears.</li>
            <li> We are very grateful that it is available now without a prescription and</li>
            <li> Works great on my feet and dried up heels.</li>
            <li> It is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> They say it makes a person more sensitive to sun, but I haven&#x27;t noticed that.  </li>
            <li> It feels similar to the kind of burning sensation you get when you put alcohol in a wound.</li>
            <li> All in all, so far, I am pleased.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling nice for the entire day.  </li>
            <li> Basically it made my skin really soft but did not make it look better at all.</li>
            <li> Nice to have a cream that actually will work for a couple days</li>
            <li> I found the product to be very mild and highly moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> It quickly became apparent (and yes I am 100% sure.</li>
            <li> if you exfoliate first even mildly, it will sting.</li>
            <li> Prescribed by my m.d. ten years ago, now over the counter and very easy to access.</li>
            <li> Works great on my old lady feet, nothing else gets rid the dry scaley skin like this</li>
            <li> It has been great in getting rid of the tiny red bumps on the backs of my arms.</li>
            <li> Ordered it again because it worked great and lasted the entire winter with daily use (as directed.)  </li>
            <li> the price on Amazon is very reasonable.  </li>
            <li> it helps my skin condition very much.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Better price same quality.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> Was so glad to find the same size bottle, identical ingredients in this lotion that&lt;br /&gt;was</li>
            <li> exactly as I was needing.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> Everyone is recommending this lately and it works as great as they say.  </li>
            <li> First review was rejected, don&#x27;t know why.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more of a rich cream than a lotion compared to the other lactic acid lotions I have ordered.</li>
            <li> This was a better price for a larger bottle.  </li>
            <li> The first time I put on my heels</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have used this company and will not try again</li>
            <li> Additionally, many of them left me feeling greasy or slimy.  </li>
            <li> but Im going back to Alpha hydrox Gylcolic acid lotion because its better in terms of moisturizing and bettering my skin,</li>
            <li> When I first asked a doctor what I could use for my condition</li>
            <li> If you scrub the affected area and persistently apply the lotion every day after a shower, your skin will definitely get better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting married in October</li>
            <li> I first started using it 25 years ago when a dermatologist prescribed it for me.  </li>
            <li> Decided to check Amazon first.  </li>
            <li> , seems to hydrate more and last longer when applied before you to bed.</li>
            <li> As soon as i get the itch and the first signs of eczema start appearing, I apply this product for couple of days and its gone.</li>
            <li> so there is even more of an adjustment period off the bat; for those unfamiliar with these type of lotions it may increase the likelihood of being put off by the initial feel (hang in there - they work!).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried neumerous products for my KP, and many left my arms feeling greasy.  </li>
            <li> This lotion seems pretty moisturizing, although maybe a tad sticky if you over apply.</li>
            <li> Also diminishes those pesky bumps that seem to love my upper arms.  </li>
            <li> I admit, I haven&#x27;t been using it religiously, but now that summer is here, I am beginning to use it more often.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m absolutely giddy over finding this!</li>
            <li> I am very thankful to have found this!</li>
            <li> It immediately soothes the skin, and the soothing action remains for a good long while.</li>
            <li> The product do a good job takes a few weeks to work.</li>
            <li> This product is great for extremely dry and cracked skin, especially for your feet.</li>
            <li> Been using for a few weeks now and it has worked the best of any product that I have tried on dry skin.</li>
            <li> Great stuff for dry feet, especially when you become a senior citizen.  </li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this lotion and it works great for my dry skin, especially in the winter.  </li>
            <li> I have tried numerous other products but in my opinion, this is the best by far.  </li>
            <li> i dont know if it will completely go away, but i am pleased with the improvement so far.</li>
            <li> the bottle is pretty large.</li>
            <li> the bottle sent to me is exactly the same, contains the 3 parabens -- returning this product for full refund!</li>
            <li> I bought this because I saw a lot of positive reviews about how it helps with keratosis pilaris.</li>
            <li> Does not take a lot for positive results.  </li>
            <li> I hope the results improve my skin tone even more long term.</li>
            <li> first time using this product, really helps with my complexion.</li>
            <li> The title pretty much says it all.  </li>
            <li> We have been married 41 years and this is the first time her feet looks normal.</li>
            <li> While this hasn&#x27;t cleared it up 100%, it&#x27;s much better than with anything else I&#x27;ve tried, and my arms aren&#x27;t dry</li>
            <li> I am 60 years old and my skin looks really good, almost no wrinkles, dark spots or enlarged pores.</li>
            <li> if I can&#x27;t get the scent out with a good airing of the mattress topper and a heavy dose of baking soda, I guess I will have to get rid of the mattress topper and get a new one</li>
            <li> Love this, really helps with dry skin.</li>
            <li> finally realized what exactly it was (I couldn&#x27;t tell originally, because the smell takes a couple weeks to appear, and again, I couldn&#x27;t smell it anymore), so I washed and drycleaned EVERYTHING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Once it&#x27;s absorbed into the skin it does feel sticky so putting on tight jeans or leggings is more of a challenge.</li>
            <li> It can sting a little when you put it on, especially on freshly shaved legs, but that&#x27;s temporary.  </li>
            <li> It was prescribed by my doctor for a foot problem and works really well.</li>
            <li> because now I have found it online and just as reasonable as my RX co-pay.  </li>
            <li> I use it head to toe because it is reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li> Works fast at exfoliating your skin, make your skin look smoother.</li>
            <li> It does that very well.</li>
            <li> when I saw this on Amazon for a much cheaper price - their answer?  </li>
            <li> It is much thicker.</li>
            <li> I also gently file the skin on the heels for mainatance.  </li>
            <li> Really helps with my scalpy skin.</li>
            <li> This creme worked very well.  </li>
            <li> SO MUCH NICER ALL AROUND.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do much for my Keratosis Pillaris</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not working at this time and have to watch how much I spend.</li>
            <li> The product I really wanted to purchase - a Le Edge stainless steel exfoliator I found out was out of stock.</li>
            <li> I was able to find this on a different web site for a few $ more with NO shipping charges and took my payment over the phone.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.  </li>
            <li> I personally don&#x27;t really like the smell it has, and it can rub off onto your sheets and clothes leaving that scent on it.</li>
            <li> This product really helps.</li>
            <li> This product really works.  </li>
            <li> ( I purchased the necessarily $35 in products to qualify for the free shipping.  </li>
            <li> I recommend it highly!</li>
            <li> dont care much for the smell....</li>
            <li> it is better than any other product in this category that I have tried.  </li>
            <li> finally become fresh!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t seem to help any better than other products I have used.</li>
            <li> I think it probably affects some people more than others (possibly due to the acid/alkaline level of your skin, etc.)</li>
            <li> Burns a little when you put it on after shaving, but makes you super soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> Apply in small amounts, get amazing results.</li>
            <li> There is no offensive sour odor like I experienced with other brands.</li>
            <li> And, you can use this lotion and still use your regular body lotion or perfume if you want you skin to smell sweet.  </li>
            <li> This product makes good skin look and feel better and it can make some types of bad skin look and feel normal!</li>
            <li> I cannot live without this stuff!</li>
            <li> this is slightly different than the original formulation by Upsher-Smith, but worth trying because of its low price.</li>
            <li> I was given a bottle of Ammonium Lactate 12% and after using it only 2 times my skin is so soft and smooth, and all signs of the Psoriasis are all but gone.</li>
            <li> A similiar lotion at my local store cost more than this for a much smaller bottle.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have purchased this product online, it is the same product that sells at the pharmacy but for much, much more.</li>
            <li> it is actually cheaper online than in most local stores.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only thing that works on my feet, which are smooth and supple at 64 years old.  </li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s main purpose), and one star off for the scent.</li>
            <li> For me, this product didn&#x27;t work and actually made my bumps more red and noticeable.</li>
            <li> The product is bit smelly, but it seems to be the only thing that works with my mild eczema.  </li>
            <li> As I get older, so does my skin.</li>
            <li> If nothing else, it seems like a decent lotion and</li>
            <li> if I actually used it once or twice a day it would actually be even more beneficial.</li>
            <li> It seems easier to apply &amp; takes less product right after a warm shower rather than applying when your skin is completely dry.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended</li>
            <li> Would recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> the doctor gave me a rx for but at a highly reduced price.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I can highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It works just as well (for me maybe even a little better) and as it is a bit thicker than classic Amlactin</li>
            <li> THIS BRAND IS A LITTLE MORE THICK, BUT IT STILL SPREADS NICELY.</li>
            <li> I even use it on a regular basis sometimes, because it leaves my skin super soft!</li>
            <li> The product really keeps my skin soft.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t great when you put it on, but it is sticky and I found it was difficult to get dressed if I put it on after my shower, so then I would put it on before I went to sleep.  </li>
            <li> It really helps my 51 year old skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try it for a few more months</li>
            <li> But after using this lotion in place of Amlactin for a few weeks I&#x27;m quite pleased and will continue to purchase this instead.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to use much of this product either, so it will last pretty well.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend, but use with caution if you have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> With regular use, the lotion works like magic to get rid of scaly, dry skin, and keratosis pilaris on legs and backs of arms.</li>
            <li> I new</li>
            <li> Fantastic moisturizer - especially in dry winter months and in summer after exposure to sun.  </li>
            <li> My Dermatologist recommended this as I have extraordinary dry skin.  </li>
            <li> this lotion takes the itch out immediately and heals super dry skin.  </li>
            <li> The only down sides are that it&#x27;s pricey and it has a strong medicinal or chemical odor when I first put it on...</li>
            <li> It keeps these \\&quot;rougher\\&quot; skin areas very soft.</li>
            <li> Good, I had used a couple of ammonium lotion but nowadays, I usually buy this lotion for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> This lotion really works on dry skin, better than any other over-the-counter product.  </li>
            <li> I make sure to use a sunscreen year round!  </li>
            <li> My beautiful wife suffers from skin asthma.  </li>
            <li> This is the exact same thing!  </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve also been really scrubbing the areas of my arms with the bumps with a rough sponge in the shower) but it does seem very promising.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Lac-Hydrin esque products for nearly 20 years, and I can&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
            <li> initially given to me as an RX, price was great as yours was less than half the&lt;br /&gt;price of the RX one.  </li>
            <li> It is not very viscous and soaks in adequately.</li>
            <li> I have try lot of different kind lotion in the past, nothing work like this one.</li>
            <li> Same as AmLactin, but more product for less money.</li>
            <li> My skin is so soft and smooth now, and it appears to be helping slightly with the texture and appearance of some of my stretch marks.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true that they didn&#x27;t add in any perfumes to give it a flowery scent and such, however, that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s &amp;#34;scent&amp;#34; free.</li>
            <li> Many people have this condition - small white bumps primarily on the back of arms (can be on back, legs, face also) -</li>
            <li> Most heel remedies are simply petroleum jelly and do soften a bit, but this Ammonium Lactate actually worked and with regular application continues to help my rough, crusty heels look a little more presentable.</li>
            <li> this truly works to clear up Keratosis Pilaris.  </li>
            <li> Ammonium Lactate in this 12% formula works like a charm to clear up the bumps.  </li>
            <li> I bought this to clear up the Kertosis Pilaris on the backs of my arms.  </li>
            <li> So far I have been using it daily for 1 1/2 months and with continued use it really does make my skin feel softer and smoother.  </li>
            <li> Used after bathing with a sensitive skin soap, it has&lt;br /&gt;helped</li>
            <li> The bottle said not to get it on one&#x27;s lips or the corners by one&#x27;s nose, but I do, and it causes no trouble.</li>
            <li> This creams makes your skin so soft.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin, I would NOT recommend this product.</li>
            <li> definately not the same stuff you get by prescription, very sticky, after using it for a week</li>
            <li> The last time I recommended they correct it ( has not been done) and be  much more careful about such descriptions.</li>
            <li> I use this to keep my feet soft in the summer.</li>
            <li> I also use it on my face, neck, and chest (although not every day, that skin is too sensitive) to counteract the signs of aging.</li>
            <li> It has faded my stretch marks and given me silky smooth skin, and I don&#x27;t even do it everyday.</li>
            <li> Hence, my crusty heels have developed just like my dad&#x27;s did when he was alive.</li>
            <li> Your skin will feel as soft as a baby</li>
            <li> This product plumps up my skin and gives it a soft touch.  </li>
            <li> Then this scent of urine developed in my room--even after changing the sheets, etc.  </li>
            <li> My skin already feels smoother &amp; the redness &amp; bumps have almost completely gone away.</li>
            <li> Makes them soft after a couple applications.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist finally prescribed 12% ammonium lactate cream in a squeeze tube a few years ago, and it was better than anything else I had tried.  </li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin, and it caused some little red bumps on my arm at first, but those quickly went away.</li>
            <li> This was first referred to me by a podiatrist for my dry, cracked feet.</li>
            <li> A pharmacist told me once that a little goes a long way, and rubbing it in well gets better results that using a lot of it.  </li>
            <li> I find that I&#x27;m able to use less of it overall which further extends its use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> However, in list of ingreidents on Amazon, water is first, whereas, on my current product it is the second.</li>
            <li> I find this to be a little tacky after use, but there was no bad smell, which was a bonus.</li>
            <li> Only downside: leaves skin sticky when the humidity is high.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to anyone with a similar problem.</li>
            <li> You left off all of the parabens that are added to this product (which I had to go on other sites which list the full set of ingredients to find).</li>
            <li> This is very helpful for dry itchy skin,.  </li>
            <li> It really helped my dry, cracked hand and heels.</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin problems, you will not believe how fast the results will show up.  </li>
            <li> It worked very well on my dry skin</li>
            <li> One reviewer complained about the smell and it is true that this lotion does not smell like your normal perfumed body lotions.  </li>
            <li> My skin is starting to feel as soft as a baby&#x27;s butt!</li>
            <li> Other than that, it works pretty well on my bumpy skin, when used sparingly.</li>
            <li> I am willing to live with the smell because it is one of the few things that works on my kp.</li>
            <li> The lotion has a very slight chemical odor that dissipates quickly.  </li>
            <li> But as far as it&#x27;s moisturizing ability, I guess I can&#x27;t really say that I notice it being any better or worse than just about any other moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I, as a general rule, don&#x27;t write reviews.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin that requires this location, particularly after I work out, work up a sweat and take a shower.</li>
            <li> but I can barely stand the smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been doing is using a soft loofa in the shower &amp; exfoliate the problem areas to open up the pores.</li>
            <li> People normally guess my age at ten years younger than I am.</li>
            <li> After a short period of time feet are back to normal.  </li>
            <li> It helps tremendously on just dry sking, and extremely well&lt;br /&gt;on</li>
            <li> Because the bumps look a little like pimples, many sufferers try acne/pimple remedies, but those are of little use.  </li>
            <li> It does the exact same job as the other stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> highly recommend this to anyone with dry skin!</li>
            <li> It does have a unique smell and is slight sticky, but this is to be expected with any lactate lotion.</li>
            <li> It works great and less expensive than some of the bigger brands of face cream.  </li>
            <li> Helped clear up the tiny red bumps on my arms.</li>
            <li> Usually buy the pharmacutecial brand, but this is as good as the other, only costs less.  </li>
            <li> This lotion smwelles a little funny, but it works for the dryness of the skin, the price is correct, thank you</li>
            <li> The only criticism would be the less than stellar, somewhat medicinal smell.</li>
            <li> apparently-- smells identical, works the same.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this for a couple days so far, but I notice a big different in the red bumps on my leg</li>
            <li> I have dry sensitive skin on my arms and legs.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin and/or suffer with dry, chapped skin, this lotion is the answer!</li>
            <li> It soaks right in and is not the least bit greasy.</li>
            <li> at a reasonable price, and it takes only a small amount to cover a big area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is the only lotion I have found that actually cuts through my dry skin in the winter.</li>
            <li> Although, I only used it about a week and a half so far.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is so completely and utterly not worth it.</li>
            <li> I even use it on my face occasionally when I get dry patches.</li>
            <li> The product cured my dry skin area on the sole within  5 days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had dry, scaly skin (technically called ichthyosis) since birth.  </li>
            <li> WOULD TELL EVERYONE TO GET THIS AS THE ONLY LOTION FOR DRY SKIN</li>
            <li> I use it for my dry, cracked hands overnight only and it does work</li>
            <li> If you have dry scaly hands, this will fix that up after only one application.</li>
            <li> Helped my dry skin, but yuck - left me feeling sticky all day.  </li>
            <li> It does take a few weeks though to see results and it seems to get worse before it gets better.</li>
            <li> I have had dry skin as long as I can remember and I have used various products for it.</li>
            <li> Has a slight ammonia smell at first but goes away after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Ammonium lactate, on the other hand, has actually changed the nature and quality of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;The only caveat is not to get it in your eyes or on your lips.  </li>
            <li> For those of you looking for a cheaper alternative to Amlactin (or other similar lotions) as I was, this definitely fits the bill.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it that long.  </li>
            <li> so far, i have appled it a few times a day.</li>
            <li> the lotion causes a minor sting when it is applied.  </li>
            <li> It also has a strange smell, as someone who likes to smell girly and floral</li>
            <li> My wife has been using this lotion for a long time and it works for her.</li>
            <li> The product does have a faint smell - almost like Elmer&#x27;s glue - but it is not very strong and easily overpowered by my regular skin cream&#x27;s scent.  </li>
            <li> Compared to other similar products</li>
            <li> I have always had extremely dry skin since childhood.  </li>
            <li> after I showed her my severe dry skin.  </li>
            <li> completely dry in the rash</li>
            <li> when you hands start to get dry.</li>
            <li> I have used this lotion for years (prescription from my doctor)to heal my dry skin.</li>
            <li> it and often recommend to friends with dry skin complaints.</li>
            <li> smells like glue, feels like glue and does nothing for my dry cracked skin.</li>
            <li> I have EXTREMELY dry skin</li>
            <li> This lotion works wonders on dry shaly skin.  </li>
            <li> It works for dry and cracking feet.</li>
            <li> I have excessively dry, damaged skin from years of teaching swim lessons without using protective lotions.  </li>
            <li> I have always suffered from really dry skin in the winter.</li>
            <li> I RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE WHO HAS DRY SKIN THAT SCALES</li>
            <li> Helps with the dry, bumpy skin</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended AmLac lotion for my dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Let dry on the skin before dressing.</li>
            <li> well then I found that I can now buy it over the counter for dry skin.</li>
            <li> have dry skin on my lower leg areas.  </li>
            <li> Would recommend it for everyone who has dry skin issues.  </li>
            <li> Dry skin.</li>
            <li> It helps hydrate dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I exfoliate nightly by dry brushing my skin and apply this lotion twice a day.  </li>
            <li> My podiatrist recommended this lotion for extremely dry skin and callouses.  </li>
            <li> Then once I pat myself dry, I apply the lotion.</li>
            <li> After 2 weeks of use all my flaky dry skin is gone.</li>
            <li> Before I started using it, my legs were dry and flakey.  </li>
            <li> Works well on dry skin or cracks in heels.  </li>
            <li> Bought this for dry cracking feet.  </li>
            <li> First the bumps go down and then the red-ish aspect of the area slowly disappears.</li>
            <li> I have never noticed a single downside.</li>
            <li> The smell is not offensive at all - slightly medicinal but doesn&#x27;t last long, and a dime-sized amount covers each arm.</li>
            <li> A bottle will last a very long time because you only use a very little bit at a time.  </li>
            <li> I try to use this product 2x a day but often forget, but I have noticed that the red spots on my arms are going down</li>
            <li> product for 50% less at a local drug store.</li>
            <li> It provides a slight acid peel and moisturizes at the same time.  </li>
            <li> Works well on dry skin, but does leave a little sticky feel for several minutes.</li>
            <li> This lotion works well for very dry skin.</li>
            <li> I HAVE VERY DRY SKIN THAT SCALES</li>
            <li> My skin gets very dry and this seems to help.  </li>
            <li> At first only a few people could notice the smell, I was one of them, and it smelled worse than death to me.</li>
            <li> She has been using this for only a few days and the bottom of her feet has now got color in them and they are no longer dry.  </li>
            <li> I use it everyday, and especially when the weather is dry.</li>
            <li> It takes so little that I can make a bottle last a couple months and</li>
            <li> I use just a little daily on the problem areas and even though I suffered with the bumps for years, there is now no sign of the condition.  </li>
            <li> As compared to other brands this product does not help my dry skin.</li>
            <li> I am, however, careful to keep it away from my eyes.  </li>
            <li> Seems as though it is missing or does not have enough emollient qualities.</li>
            <li> Just using it a few times, I can feel a big difference in my feet.</li>
            <li> of all for me, there isn&#x27;t a heavy perfumed smell left on my body.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s feet is nothing but dried skin that cracks open</li>
            <li> This works as well as the brand name product, Amlactin, and has reduced the rough discolored spots on my legs</li>
            <li> i am stunned that i can see a difference in my kp after only a few days.</li>
            <li> The lotion will tingle on any broken skin, so exfoliate gently.  </li>
            <li> I recommend it to anyone who has rough or bumpy skin.</li>
            <li> Expensive, but worth it and cheaper than name brand.  </li>
            <li> to advise my online friends there who suffer dry skin!!</li>
            <li> cleared up dry , flaky areas within a week!!</li>
            <li> No more red, scaly, dry skin.</li>
            <li> This product works just like advertised, not greasy or oily and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It only takes a small amount to cover arm, leg, etc.  </li>
            <li> I was perscribed this by my dermetologist but not having insurance it made it pretty difficult to get my hands on it until i found this</li>
            <li> I need something lighter in consistency because I use other product I like to combine it with.</li>
            <li> In other words, it&#x27;s hydrating.  </li>
            <li> like some of the other reviewers have.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t return due to rules of sale.  </li>
            <li> It clears up the little bumps on the backs of my arms and moisturizes my dry feet so well.</li>
            <li> My legs have always given me trouble with dry itchy skin.  </li>
            <li> The dermo told me to buy lotions with the ammonium lactate active ingredient.</li>
            <li> Gold Bond Rough &amp; Bumpy seems to work better without the annoying smell, though.</li>
            <li> I have pretty bad kp on my upper arms &amp; after using about 2-3 weeks</li>
            <li> So, I am not happy because I want to avoid parabens and bought this product assuming the ingredient list was complete.  </li>
            <li> so my friends stopped letting me come in their rooms because when I sat down the smell came off of my clothes and onto the furniture</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it&#x27;s not trying to force oil into your skin, but rather, it&#x27;s laying down a barrier that lets your skin hold on to the water that&#x27;s in it.  </li>
            <li> stuff works in the extreme!  </li>
            <li> It can leave a slightly oily residue on your skin so don’t over apply it.</li>
            <li> The price at Amazon.com was about half</li>
            <li> I was given a prescription for a serious medication with possible side effects.</li>
            <li> Perhaps I have a slight allergy to it - I don&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> This product works every bit as well as the name brand Ammonium Lactate lotion for less than half the cost.</li>
            <li> There are not many lotions out there proven to soften rough skin by the FDA-</li>
            <li> I usually mix it with a less expensive brand that smells really good, although this lotion doesn&#x27;t smell bad.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months now and don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m even through half the bottle.  </li>
            <li> im not talking just a little ashy im talking DRRRYYYY</li>
            <li> I suffer from KP which leaves little scales on your skin.</li>
            <li> It helped moisturize a little bit.  </li>
            <li> Lactic acid lotions perform all kinds of miracles on my unfortunate skin:  gets rid of those yucky arm bumps, decreases ingrown hairs on my legs, relieves severely dry skin (even on your heels), eliminates back and chest blemishes...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for this product because it contains mineral oil, which is a petroleum distillate, and it feels heavy and greasy on my skin.</li>
            <li> a few years ago, and then couldn&#x27;t find it again.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have trouble walking or bleeding coming from my heals or sides of my feet.</li>
            <li> but after a while I noticed it actually had started to make my skin look worse.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> I have used it for years now and apply it everyday.</li>
            <li> I have kp and was using it for a few years.</li>
            <li> you are dead set on using this lotion maybe, maybe</li>
            <li> and I have few of them but use it anyway.</li>
            <li> Works just as well as the expensive brand and gets your heels soft</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this lotion for the cracked heels caused by the miserable New England winters, and it really works!</li>
            <li> and I paid less too!</li>
            <li> Well, it&#x27;s super sticky which is a gross feeling any time of day but especially bad if you&#x27;re about to dress or get in bed.</li>
            <li> , last year, I don&#x27;t know if the ingredients changed or what, but suddenly everything it touched started smelling horrible a few weeks later.</li>
            <li> gave it a 4 star, because when I used it on a particularly bad area of skin, it worked really well.  </li>
            <li> I used to have a really bad eczema, but thanks to this product, I almost do not have that problem anymore.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s been working on the keratosis pilaris on my arms.</li>
            <li> I am physically challanged which makes it difficult to get around at times.</li>
            <li> USUALLY ONE APPLICATION DOES THE RESTORATION.  </li>
            <li> and after a few weeks of use, the bumps are invisible after the lotion is applied!</li>
            <li> I suffer EVERY winter from unbelievable itchy skin - I have for years...</li>
            <li> I use it on my face, dont use it too often in that area, it might cause excessive peeling.</li>
            <li> I had dried cracked heals that was so bad that I could barely walk.</li>
            <li> It does not have a strong floral smell or anything that is terribly offensive, but I do notice the smell.  </li>
            <li> If you prefer Lac-Hydrin to Amlactin (as I do), and want the stronger version (i.e. 12, rather than 6), which is hard to find, this is the answer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Apparantly, they want me to write at least 20 words.  </li>
            <li> AT THE LEAST.</li>
            <li> The product works well, but it is a slow process.</li>
            <li> It was very expensive then but now that it&#x27;s no longer by prescription only,  anyone can afford it.  </li>
            <li> I was watching one of the morning shows, and they recommended a lotion that contains lactic acid for treating dry and cracking feet because of the cold winters we have.</li>
            <li> It stopped the winter itch I had and is less expensive than the name brand, AmLac.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t smell it, but 70% or more of people are horribly upset by it (and yes, I&#x27;ve asked dozens of people, had blind smelling tests --</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll continue to use this, because it isnt bad, but I think next time i&#x27;ll be purchasing the amlactin</li>
            <li> It was obvious after one minute it was going to stop the painful itching.</li>
            <li> She has been to plenty of doctors with no good results.  </li>
            <li> Age related dry skin has been a terrible chore.</li>
            <li> And they immediately were horrified by the smell that actually made them sick.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed with Amazon as this is the second time, in a row, that the product has not been described correctly.</li>
            <li> To bad it doesn&#x27;t cure dry skin but does help.</li>
            <li> The lotion is very thin and feels almost like glycerin, so a small amount can cover a lot of surface</li>
            <li> all dirty stuff from my skin disappear little by little.&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> I got tired of the smell and tossed it.</li>
            <li> also used it for repairing cracking skin from my face and behind the ears.</li>
            <li> 5/5 stars, expensive but</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy, it&#x27;s not really a great smell but who cares when it works this well!</li>
            <li> Way too expensive for what you get.</li>
            <li> AS IT WILL BE UNCOMFORTABLE--</li>
            <li> There is this lingering faint scent of urine.  </li>
            <li> He would come in my room, and make this weird wincing face.  </li>
            <li> No animals, no ferments... but still a faint scent of urine.  </li>
            <li> i have, er, had awfully cracked, dry skin on the bottoms of my feet.</li>
            <li> If you have the worst dry, scaly skin, then you should try this product.</li>
            <li> and I have keratosis pilaris (chicken skin) on my arms.</li>
            <li> I have keratin pilaris (chicken bump skin) on my arms.</li>
            <li> I asked him what was the matter; he said, \\&quot;it stinks in here.\\</li>
            <li> However it is very expensive, plus you need a prescription for it.</li>
            <li> but I think I am going to be disappointed.</li>
            <li> (but it was costly, so I hate to do</li>
            <li> (too bad I didn&#x27;t get the hair!),</li>
            <li> it has parabens - very bad.  </li>
            <li> then I woke up with a HORRIBLE rash all over the application area.  </li>
            <li> my stomach was horrible but after buying this and applying this lotion it has deff kept me on track</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway my friends started refusing to come in my dorm room, or be within 10 feet of my doorway, because the smell was so horrible, and even though I used it at night</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Helped clear up the tiny red bumps on my arms. Smell isn&#x27;t to pleasant though.m</li>
            <li> This lotion works well for very dry skin. It is not very viscous and soaks in adequately. It can leave a slightly oily residue on your skin so don’t over apply it. It helps to soften calloused areas and heals cracking. It should be used regularly.</li>
            <li> A very good lotion.  It was prescribed by my doctor for a foot problem and works really well.</li>
            <li> I have always had extremely dry skin since childhood.  Scaly and itch especially in these winter months.  Years ago I went to a dermatologist who prescribed me this lotion.  My boss covered it under the RX Plan (she&#x27;s the Plan Adminstrator) after I showed her my severe dry skin.  I used it for a year and loved it.  We then switched RX Plans.. and I just never looked into getting it refilled after the prescription was up.      Recently I called my dermatologist to see if she would call it in and she wouldn&#x27;t without seeing me.  Well... I&#x27;m glad she didn&#x27;t because now I have found it online and just as reasonable as my RX co-pay.  I just started using it again and I can already tell it&#x27;s beginning to work.  My skin is starting to feel as soft as a baby&#x27;s butt! :)     Even linked this site to my FACEBOOK.. to advise my online friends there who suffer dry skin!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for this product because it contains mineral oil, which is a petroleum distillate, and it feels heavy and greasy on my skin. It probably works quite well at what it does, but I would rather find a lotion made with plant oils.</li>
            <li> product as advertised would buy again</li>
            <li> Best lotion for my KP, and trust me I have tried them all. Great price for volume of product. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> my husband loves this lotion for his skin!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this lotion for years, and it&#x27;s more convenient to purchase now that it is OTC.  (The price is the same, though).  It works best if you apply it right after a shower; it seems to lock the moisture in.  The lotion spreads well, so a bottle lasts several months. I cannot live without this stuff!</li>
            <li> This product is great for extremely dry and cracked skin, especially for your feet. I received the product from seller very quickly and it was just as promised.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I was given the Ammonium Lactate lotion when I was in the hospital recently. It is absolutely the best for dry skin and cracked heels and elbows. It is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> So nice not to have to get a prescription for this product anymore.  For those of you who visit the dermatologist and use this type of product you will be very pleased.  Better price same quality.</li>
            <li> Both my sons have skin problems and this is the only product that helps! I would definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> Ammonium Lactate is very good for scaly dry skin, but I also want to add (for any fellow sufferers)that this truly works to clear up Keratosis Pilaris.  Many people have this condition - small white bumps primarily on the back of arms (can be on back, legs, face also) - that is genetic and caused by a build up of keratin in the hair follicles and has no cure.  Because the bumps look a little like pimples, many sufferers try acne/pimple remedies, but those are of little use.  Keratosis Pilaris can&#x27;t be cured but Ammonium Lactate in this 12% formula works like a charm to clear up the bumps.  It takes so little that I can make a bottle last a couple months and since you can get this now without prescription, it provides a inexpensive way to have beautiful skin.  I use just a little daily on the problem areas and even though I suffered with the bumps for years, there is now no sign of the condition.  So nice to be able to wear a sleeveless shirt without embarrassment!  One reviewer complained about the smell and it is true that this lotion does not smell like your normal perfumed body lotions.  I want to assure anyone who might be put off by the smell that is not that strong and dissipates within a couple minutes once applied. The odor does not remain on your skin. And, you can use this lotion and still use your regular body lotion or perfume if you want you skin to smell sweet.  This product makes good skin look and feel better and it can make some types of bad skin look and feel normal! I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> Was so glad to find the same size bottle, identical ingredients in this lotion that&lt;br /&gt;was initially given to me as an RX, price was great as yours was less than half the&lt;br /&gt;price of the RX one.  It helps tremendously on just dry sking, and extremely well&lt;br /&gt;on diabetic rash problems.  Used after bathing with a sensitive skin soap, it has&lt;br /&gt;helped completely dry in the rash I was plaqued with.  So glad I was able to find&lt;br /&gt;this at a reasonable price, and it takes only a small amount to cover a big area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before purchasing, the makeup of the two lotions were checked based on the info&lt;br /&gt;provided with your online product.  Would definitely recommend this for anyone who&lt;br /&gt;has a similar problem.</li>
            <li> The most affordable option for purchasing lactic acid lotion intended to treat keratosis pilaris. Same as AmLactin, but more product for less money.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product for dry sensitive skin. Prescribed by my m.d. ten years ago, now over the counter and very easy to access.</li>
            <li> exactly as I was needing.  THe lotion is the same as what the dr had gave me.  Work great if you want smooth skin for the winter months.</li>
            <li> I have suffered from Psoriasis for over 25 years and have tried just about every lotion out there and nothing helped with the red scaly skin....not even lotion specificaly for Psoriasis!! I was given a bottle of Ammonium Lactate 12% and after using it only 2 times my skin is so soft and smooth, and all signs of the Psoriasis are all but gone. No more red, scaly, dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have had dry skin as long as I can remember and I have used various products for it. My dermatologist recommended this product some time ago and this works best among all skin care products I have tried. The price at Amazon.com was about half what my pharmacy sells this at and the delivery time was excellent.</li>
            <li> Dr. recommended I try this for my eczema and it appears to be helping. It arrived quickly and in neat, undamaged packaging. And the price was well below what I would have paid through my pharmacy.</li>
            <li> This lotion keeps my skin looking younger than its 75 years. People often mention my skin when they say I look younger than I am. The lotion has a very slight chemical odor that dissipates quickly.  It leaves one&#x27;s skin moist and supple for 24 to 48 hours.  It removes those bumps one gets on thighs and backs of upper arms.  It is good for nail cuticles and cracked heels.  Once in a while it stings going on, but that goes away.  They say it makes a person more sensitive to sun, but I haven&#x27;t noticed that.  I have very fair sensitive skin inherited from my red headed grand mother (too bad I didn&#x27;t get the hair!), and I find no problem with irritation using this lotion. The bottle said not to get it on one&#x27;s lips or the corners by one&#x27;s nose, but I do, and it causes no trouble. I am, however, careful to keep it away from my eyes.  I use it head to toe because it is reasonably priced.  I have never noticed a single downside.</li>
            <li> Great product. The only lotion that relieves my urticaria. Will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> i have, er, had awfully cracked, dry skin on the bottoms of my feet. i happened to be in a pharmacy and saw this stuff. i tried and just three weeks later i could almost become a foot model. definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> Fabulous moisturizer that used to be prescribed by my dermatologist.</li>
            <li> I have been using this lotion for two years but I have been buying at a pharmacy for $34.00 a bottle. This is the same lotion at a third of that price. Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> This creams makes your skin so soft. This is definitely great for the winter time when you hands start to get dry.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased to be able to buy this lotion on line. I have used this lotion for years (prescription from my doctor)to heal my dry skin.</li>
            <li> I recieved the name through my dermatologist, picked up the product and found it the best dry skin cream ever!&lt;br /&gt;Love it and often recommend to friends with dry skin complaints.</li>
            <li> Use it allt he time, excellent product.  Please review your review process and shorten this item so I can tell you how I feel without writing a book!</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I have used it for years on my face and neck and get compliments all the time on my skin! I am 60 years old and my skin looks really good, almost no wrinkles, dark spots or enlarged pores. I make sure to use a sunscreen year round!  It is not perfumed, which I appreciate. It is a bit too strong for my chest and decolletage when used full-strength, but I add it to another lotion for that area. It has been great in getting rid of the tiny red bumps on the backs of my arms. Highly recommend, but use with caution if you have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this to clear up the Kertosis Pilaris on the backs of my arms.  I used it for about a week then I woke up with a HORRIBLE rash all over the application area.  The rash is spreading to my lower arms and hands.  If you have sensitive skin, I would NOT recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, non precription, well worth the try!! Best price I could find for a product that works very well.</li>
            <li> WORKS GREAT! WILL BUY AGAIN.</li>
            <li> definately not the same stuff you get by prescription, very sticky, after using it for a week, i see no difference....the lotion you get by prescription works in 48 hours.....wont buy again and do not reccomend it.....</li>
            <li> I bought this as it&#x27;s similar to AmLactin.  Some folks had issues with the smell: to me it&#x27;s the same as LacHydrin and AmLactin, both of which I use</li>
            <li> I received this product very quickly and it was packaged well. I had been prescribed this product by my skin doctor and it is running low. It was manufactured by Perrigo and so is the one from Amazon. That was a very nice feature for me. It arrived today and does not look like the picture on Amazon but is manufactured by Perrigo. However, in list of ingreidents on Amazon, water is first, whereas, on my current product it is the second. That could be a big difference in performance. I am disappointed with Amazon as this is the second time, in a row, that the product has not been described correctly. The last time I recommended they correct it ( has not been done) and be  much more careful about such descriptions. I will report back about this product but I think I am going to be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Does not work as the one bought at the pharmacy even though it should be the same concentration.  Doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> This lotion really works on dry skin, better than any other over-the-counter product.  I used to buy it when it was a prescription years ago.  This generic works just as well.</li>
            <li> This is the absolute best lotion for dry, cracked, scaly skin.  It only takes a small amount to cover arm, leg, etc.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I was perscribed this by my dermetologist but not having insurance it made it pretty difficult to get my hands on it until i found this and im in love... my stomach was horrible but after buying this and applying this lotion it has deff kept me on track i even bought one for my sister in law its a must buy</li>
            <li> Everyone is recommending this lately and it works as great as they say.  When ordering, pay attention to type of product (lotion, cream, etc.), price per ounce, and if shipping charges apply to get the best deal.</li>
            <li> My beautiful wife suffers from skin asthma.  Especially in the winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff works in the extreme!  We are very grateful that it is available now without a prescription and the price on Amazon is very reasonable.  Especially if your are a Prime member!</li>
            <li> First used this kind of lotion when I was prescribed to use it.  Then, realized it&#x27;s available over-the-counter as well.  There are not many lotions out there proven to soften rough skin by the FDA- but this one is.  If you&#x27;ve got cracks in your skin from dryness, this lotion will burn a bit in those openings. Any openings in your skin will burn if you use this lotion.  I don&#x27;t mind the burning as it&#x27;s not terribly bad. It feels similar to the kind of burning sensation you get when you put alcohol in a wound. For best results, i put it on my hands and feet, then I put socks and cotton gloves on and it really restored my skin within a week or so.</li>
            <li> Works fast at exfoliating your skin, make your skin look smoother.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin that requires this location, particularly after I work out, work up a sweat and take a shower.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist wrote me a script for this lotion, but the pharmacy wanted to charge me $60 for it!  This is the exact same thing!  Works great!</li>
            <li> Will do for the price but doesn&#x27;t work as well as the prescription stuff.</li>
            <li> Only downside: leaves skin sticky when the humidity is high. Otherwise, fine.</li>
            <li> If you prefer Lac-Hydrin to Amlactin (as I do), and want the stronger version (i.e. 12, rather than 6), which is hard to find, this is the answer. Same formula, apparently-- smells identical, works the same. A miracle lotion! And a bargain.</li>
            <li> smells like glue, feels like glue and does nothing for my dry cracked skin. I got tired of the smell and tossed it.</li>
            <li> Got this for my nephew who has skin rashes. They are gone now. Worked well, and I am pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it that long.  I had gotten 12% lactic acid lotion (different brand) a few years ago, and then couldn&#x27;t find it again.&lt;br /&gt;I gave it a 4 star, because when I used it on a particularly bad area of skin, it worked really well.  I will continue to use it, and&lt;br /&gt;then give my rating.  All in all, so far, I am pleased.</li>
            <li> I have EXTREMELY dry skin im not talking just a little ashy im talking DRRRYYYY my skin looks like a reptile! but this stuff makes it all go away and my skin looks like everyone elses! If you get this from the pharmacy its like 50 dollars maybe more so great price as well!</li>
            <li> it works great. it has a tingling feeling on the callouses but it does soften them up. i will buy it again when i run out.</li>
            <li> The product works well, but it is a slow process. it is better than any other product in this category that I have tried.  Great price on this product compared to retail stores.</li>
            <li> Been using for a few weeks now and it has worked the best of any product that I have tried on dry skin.</li>
            <li> Keeps my feet nice and soft ^_^ ....I only use it once or twice a week now</li>
            <li> Ingredients include methylparaben and propylparaben.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apparantly, they want me to write at least 20 words.  So, I am not happy because I want to avoid parabens and bought this product assuming the ingredient list was complete.  It is not.</li>
            <li> I f you have itchy skin use this lotion.</li>
            <li> this product is best for my super dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;after put on this lotion. all dirty stuff from my skin disappear little by little.&lt;br /&gt;and finally become fresh! i love it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! My doc also prescribed this, and after a week, 2x a day, my feet look much better. I don&#x27;t have trouble walking or bleeding coming from my heals or sides of my feet.</li>
            <li> My feet love this lotion. Great for all your body but I use it for my feet and I like it a lot.</li>
            <li> This stuff is an amazing moisturizer. The only down sides are that it&#x27;s pricey and it has a strong medicinal or chemical odor when I first put it on... The smell dissipates after a while or maybe my nose just doesn&#x27;t smell it any more. :o)</li>
            <li> Purchased to help remove calluses and excess skin that was causing open cracks on my feet. Combined with sanding with foot paddles, this has worked well. Needs to be used along with a good lotion to keep skin soft and pliable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have also used it for repairing cracking skin from my face and behind the ears. It does that very well. Price on Amazon is best.</li>
            <li> Great product - much cheaper than the $40 co-payment I had to pay for a &amp;#34;perscription&amp;#34; for this.  I asked the pharmacist why it&#x27;s $40 (fo the co-pay alone) when I saw this on Amazon for a much cheaper price - their answer?  One is a cream and one is a lotion.  Big deal!  Buy this instead and save money!</li>
            <li> I use this to keep my feet soft in the summer. It was better than anything I have tried. A similiar lotion at my local store cost more than this for a much smaller bottle. I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
            <li> This lotion works wonders on dry shaly skin.  Highly recommended</li>
            <li> I gave this lotion a 5 star rating as I have been using this product for many years.  It is a great exfoliant for dry skin. and also a great moisturizing lotion.  I have tried numerous other products but in my opinion, this is the best by far.  Would recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> Never thought I would find something to make the bumps go away until I used this! Works great and reasonably priced! I will order again!</li>
            <li> great will order again, package well, delivery on time.</li>
            <li> I used to use Retin-A to counteract wrinkles. However it is very expensive, plus you need a prescription for it. Then I discovered ammonium lactate lotion. It smells a bit like Elmer&#x27;s glue right out of the bottle, but the smell quickly disappears. With regular use, the lotion works like magic to get rid of scaly, dry skin, and keratosis pilaris on legs and backs of arms. I also use it on my face, neck, and chest (although not every day, that skin is too sensitive) to counteract the signs of aging. People normally guess my age at ten years younger than I am. Plus, it binds moisture to your skin, keeping your skin looking hydrated. Just keep your lotion-covered hands away from eyes and mucous membranes (it will sting).</li>
            <li> This is very helpful for dry itchy skin,.  Compared to other similar products I was pleased.  My husband wakes up at night&lt;br /&gt;due to itch ankles and the only solution is this lotion.</li>
            <li> First review was rejected, don&#x27;t know why. This is the second time I have purchased this product online, it is the same product that sells at the pharmacy but for much, much more. The product is great, they ship it fast and very well packaged. This product works just like advertised, not greasy or oily and a little goes a long way. It&#x27;s great to find this product online at this price.</li>
            <li> I suffer from keratosis pilaris and folliculitis. This stuff is great, and was a great value. A little goes a long way. I even use it on my face occasionally when I get dry patches. I have really sensitive skin, and it caused some little red bumps on my arm at first, but those quickly went away. Give it a month. I am hooked!</li>
            <li> Good, I had used a couple of ammonium lotion but nowadays, I usually buy this lotion for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> It does exfoliate. The 4 stars is because I could not choose 4.5 stars. It is much thicker. It&#x27;s more of a rich cream than a lotion compared to the other lactic acid lotions I have ordered. I need something lighter in consistency because I use other product I like to combine it with. But to my mother whom I gave one of this lotion to thinks it is excellent. For her it is a five stars :)</li>
            <li> A friend had suggested this product to me.  I tried to find it at several local store.  I found a smaller bottle after checking several stores.  This was a better price for a larger bottle.  The product really keeps my skin soft. I use it at night before going to sleep.</li>
            <li> same cream the doctor gave me a rx for but at a highly reduced price. will buy more when needed. captez</li>
            <li> I bought this for my friend that has Keratosis Pilaris. She told me she had tried everything and nothing helped until I got this for her.Would definitely recommend this to anyone with this condition.</li>
            <li> I had dried cracked heals that was so bad that I could barely walk. I had to tip toe to avoid pain.  My doctor prescribed this product.  The first time I put on my heels I new this product was going to help.  Depending what time of year I will use it twice a day.  I also gently file the skin on the heels for mainatance.  Bottom line.  I have happy feet.   For me a one pound bottle last for about a year.  Great stuff</li>
            <li> As compared to other brands this product does not help my dry skin. Seems as though it is missing or does not have enough emollient qualities. This is the first time I have used this company and will not try again</li>
            <li> I have used Ammonium Lactate 12% lotion for several years at the recommendation of my dermatologist.  It has helped treat severe ichthyosis that I have battled all my life.  I apply it all over my torso, arms &amp; legs.  It does not absorb totally into the skin, so I have to use a towel to wipe off residue so that it doesn&#x27;t end up on my clothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is advertised as fragrance free.  I smell a &amp;#34;medicinal&amp;#34; smell (sort of like an ointment) on my body after applying it that lasts for several hours. It does not have a strong floral smell or anything that is terribly offensive, but I do notice the smell.  I have found that some batches are more fragrant than others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I continue to use this product and strongly recommend it to those who are suffering from severe itching or dryness of the skin.</li>
            <li> I would start with a lower %.</li>
            <li> Great merchandise, great transaction</li>
            <li> I was watching one of the morning shows, and they recommended a lotion that contains lactic acid for treating dry and cracking feet because of the cold winters we have. Doing some research on lotions containing lactic acid, I came across Amlactin, and the generic version that is just ammonium lactate. Just using it a few times, I can feel a big difference in my feet. The lotion is very thin and feels almost like glycerin, so a small amount can cover a lot of surface area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: 5/5 stars, expensive but it is actually cheaper online than in most local stores. It works for dry and cracking feet.</li>
            <li> I believe this lotion used to be marketed as Lac-hydrin and was available by prescription only, so I was thrilled to find it on this site.  I have excessively dry, damaged skin from years of teaching swim lessons without using protective lotions.  I have tried just about every lotion around hoping to relieve the itchiness and scaliness and none worked.  Additionally, many of them left me feeling greasy or slimy.  This lotion has re-hydrated my skin, addresses the itchiness and is beginning to work on the scaly places.  It is also light and odorless.  It leaves my skin feeling nice for the entire day.  No slime or grease!  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Really helps with my scalpy skin. It&#x27;s watery enough so it&#x27;s easy to apply to large area of your body.</li>
            <li> I have not seen a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> I buy the identical item, same size from my local ShopRite Pharmacy for $11.99.  It is non-perscription, but kept at the pharmacy counter.  Sometimes they don&#x27;t have it in stock and order it for me.  Takes 2 days.</li>
            <li> This creme worked very well.  It helped my exzima, My skin is smoother and is not as ichey.  Thank you</li>
            <li> Great product that my doctor recommended, nice that it is not longer a R/X. Perfect resource for me to keep this product on hand at all times. Thank you</li>
            <li> perfect product for anybody</li>
            <li> The product cured my dry skin area on the sole within  5 days. Apply twice a day to affected ares. I fully recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have always suffered from really dry skin in the winter. I saw this on Pinterest of all places. After reading all the reviews I decided to get a bottle. It was obvious after one minute it was going to stop the painful itching. It&#x27;s not greasy, it&#x27;s not really a great smell but who cares when it works this well! I&#x27;ll more bottles for sure.</li>
            <li> I PURCHASE THIS ITEM FROM TIME TO TIME, AS I RUN OUT OF IT.  I HAVE VERY DRY SKIN THAT SCALES AND FLAKES OFF.  I DISCOVERED THAT THIS ITEM HAS LACTATE IN IT, WHICH WORKS AS A DE-BRADER,  THAT IS, IT NOT ONLY MOISTURIZES MY SKIN, IT ACTUALLY DE-BRADES THE FLAKES, LEAVING MY SKIN SO MUCH NICER ALL AROUND.  I DO NOT LIKE BEING WITHOUT IT, AS I USE IT ALMOST DAILY.  I RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE WHO HAS DRY SKIN THAT SCALES AND LOOKS LIKE FISH SKIN.  GREAT PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> LOVE HOW THIS STUFF MAKES MY SKIN FEELS. THIS AND THE AMLACTIN BRAND ARE SIMILAR. THIS BRAND IS A LITTLE MORE THICK, BUT IT STILL SPREADS NICELY.</li>
            <li> Love this, really helps with dry skin.</li>
            <li> Age related dry skin has been a terrible chore. This is a huge help.  I recommend working it in at bedtime and wearing socks and gloves for the night.  Be faithful to it. Even just once-daily use leaves a significant improvement.</li>
            <li> Great stuff for dry feet, especially when you become a senior citizen.  It&#x27;s the only thing that works on my feet, which are smooth and supple at 64 years old.  The price here is better than in stores.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I never go without this in the winter. In the summer, I can dilute by mixing with a cheaper brand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s been working on the keratosis pilaris on my arms. I don&#x27;t expect quick results, but I&#x27;m hopeful it will improve as the years go by.</li>
            <li> My husband had some skin problems, had some lazer surgery and the Dr recomended this, however we could not afford the price the drug store ask............this work wonders.............very good stuff</li>
            <li> My skin absorbs it and continues to be softer even after a shower.  It doesn&#x27;t leave a layer of&lt;br /&gt;sticky, greasy cream on the surface of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Best of all for me, there isn&#x27;t a heavy perfumed smell left on my body.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m allergic to many creams and perfumes.  This is perfect for me.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I saw a lot of positive reviews about how it helps with keratosis pilaris. At first it made my skin really smooth but it didn&#x27;t help with the appearance of my skin. I kept using it thinking that eventually it would make my skin look better but after a while I noticed it actually had started to make my skin look worse. Basically it made my skin really soft but did not make it look better at all.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this lotion for the cracked heels caused by the miserable New England winters, and it really works!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do much for my Keratosis Pillaris</li>
            <li> This product worked well for me.  It really helped my dry, cracked hand and heels. I recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> You did not list all the ingredients. If you state you are listing ingredients, you MUST list all of them. You left off all of the parabens that are added to this product (which I had to go on other sites which list the full set of ingredients to find). Shame on you</li>
            <li> Fades sunspots and signs of aging. We use it in the am and pm after showering. If skin becomes irrititated, just back off for a day or so. Best results from a product of its kind.</li>
            <li> My husband has been using this product for about 10 years. If you have the worst dry, scaly skin, then you should try this product. He use to buy by prescription only.</li>
            <li> this is slightly different than the original formulation by Upsher-Smith, but worth trying because of its low price. my second bottle!</li>
            <li> This is a Good product,at a very good price. Best price that I have found any where else. Very happy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had dry, scaly skin (technically called ichthyosis) since birth.  As you can imagine, I&#x27;ve tried probably every product on the market in several decades, both prescription and not.  My dermatologist finally prescribed 12% ammonium lactate cream in a squeeze tube a few years ago, and it was better than anything else I had tried.  Of course, now it is available over the counter in the lotion form, which this product is.  It is relatively inexpensive, and does the job.  I would highly recommend this to anyone with a similar problem.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Lac-Hydrin esque products for nearly 20 years, and I can&#x27;t live without it.  Lactic acid lotions perform all kinds of miracles on my unfortunate skin:  gets rid of those yucky arm bumps, decreases ingrown hairs on my legs, relieves severely dry skin (even on your heels), eliminates back and chest blemishes... and it&#x27;s got a nice anti-aging effect as well.  It can sting a little when you put it on, especially on freshly shaved legs, but that&#x27;s temporary.  A pharmacist told me once that a little goes a long way, and rubbing it in well gets better results that using a lot of it.  Good advice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get the 12% so I can cut it with a nice scented lotion and smell like a normal girl.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> This is a great lotion paired with a dry body brush. It has faded my stretch marks and given me silky smooth skin, and I don&#x27;t even do it everyday.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t seem to help any better than other products I have used. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying it. I would try aveeno instead.</li>
            <li> This was first referred to me by a podiatrist for my dry, cracked feet. It is the best lotion I have ever found for them.</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s feet is nothing but dried skin that cracks open and she can&#x27;t walk.  She has been to plenty of doctors with no good results.  She has been using this for only a few days and the bottom of her feet has now got color in them and they are no longer dry.  The cracks has faded away already and she can walk on her heels.  This stuff is simply amazing and that is no joke.  If you have dry skin problems, you will not believe how fast the results will show up.  We have been married 41 years and this is the first time her feet looks normal.</li>
            <li> Way too expensive for what you get. I could have purchased another brand of&lt;br /&gt;This product for 50% less at a local drug store. I am physically challanged which makes it difficult to get around at times. Also since I would have to pay for return postage it would be more money out of my pocket. I&#x27;m not working at this time and have to watch how much I spend. The product I really wanted to purchase - a Le Edge stainless steel exfoliator I found out was out of stock. I was able to find this on a different web site for a few $ more with NO shipping charges and took my payment over the phone. Also a real human being answered my call after the 3rd ring</li>
            <li> This was a re-order.  I was satisfied when I ordered the first time.  My skin gets very dry and this seems to help.  No perfumes.</li>
            <li> Same good results as the original product for a fraction of the price. Furthermore, no prescription is needed for purchase.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t do without my lotion. I&#x27;ve been using it for years as a face moisturizer and body lotion. It&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Product works well.  Nice to have a cream that actually will work for a couple days even w/out re-applying.  But takes a while to soak in and since you are supposed to use at night because you are not supposed to be in the sun while using, give yourself time before you get in bed or you will stick to the sheets!</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.  Apply once or twice a day and your feet will stop cracking.  I have used it for years now and apply it everyday.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for many years and have been very happy.</li>
            <li> My legs have always given me trouble with dry itchy skin.  This lotion is the answer!  So glad I found it!</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a replacement for the AMlactin. It&#x27;s alright but not as good. It serves it&#x27;s purpose which is moisturizing the skin, but it does not remove the scales from skin as good as the amlactin. I suffer from KP which leaves little scales on your skin. I&#x27;ll continue to use this, because it isnt bad, but I think next time i&#x27;ll be purchasing the amlactin</li>
            <li> Very good product.... I was given it in the hospital and had to find it for home....excellent pain and itch relief.  I will buy again.</li>
            <li> This is the only lotion I have found that actually cuts through my dry skin in the winter. Burns a little when you put it on after shaving, but makes you super soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true that they didn&#x27;t add in any perfumes to give it a flowery scent and such, however, that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s &amp;#34;scent&amp;#34; free. I personally don&#x27;t really like the smell it has, and it can rub off onto your sheets and clothes leaving that scent on it. But as far as it&#x27;s moisturizing ability, I guess I can&#x27;t really say that I notice it being any better or worse than just about any other moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used. I got it because I read that it works excellent on getting rid of back zits, which I get sometimes from all the sweating and working out that I do, and genetics, but I haven&#x27;t seen it help at all with that. I give it 4 stars because it still moisturizes (it&#x27;s main purpose), and one star off for the scent.</li>
            <li> Purchased this product last year and needed a refill.  Ordered it again because it worked great and lasted the entire winter with daily use (as directed.)  Best product at a great price that I would otherwise have to pay a doctor&#x27;s visit fee and marked-up price to get.  Well worth it!</li>
            <li> Okay..... it works but I can barely stand the smell. Is this an issue with anyone else. It almost gags me.</li>
            <li> Its okay but Im going back to Alpha hydrox Gylcolic acid lotion because its better in terms of moisturizing and bettering my skin,</li>
            <li> When I first asked a doctor what I could use for my condition I was given a prescription for a serious medication with possible side effects. Later, when I asked another doctor, she recommended this product. It works great and there are no side effects.</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE BEST OF THESE PRODUCTS I HAVE EVER USED.  USUALLY ONE APPLICATION DOES THE RESTORATION.  BUT DO NOT USE ON OPEN DAMAGE AS IT WILL BE UNCOMFORTABLE--AT THE LEAST.</li>
            <li> If you scrub the affected area and persistently apply the lotion every day after a shower, your skin will definitely get better. First the bumps go down and then the red-ish aspect of the area slowly disappears. Overall, I&#x27;m happy with it and would recommend.</li>
            <li> Helps with the dry, bumpy skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting married in October and I have keratosis pilaris (chicken skin) on my arms. I try to use this product 2x a day but often forget, but I have noticed that the red spots on my arms are going down and after a few weeks of use, the bumps are invisible after the lotion is applied! I&#x27;ll try it for a few more months (I&#x27;ve also been really scrubbing the areas of my arms with the bumps with a rough sponge in the shower) but it does seem very promising. The smell is not offensive at all - slightly medicinal but doesn&#x27;t last long, and a dime-sized amount covers each arm.</li>
            <li> love this item will order more</li>
            <li> i wish i had taken a before picture before starting this lotion. I have pretty bad kp on my upper arms &amp; after using about 2-3 weeks it has cleared up.. I thought nothing was ever going to help, ive used creams from dermatologists &amp; nothing helped but this does!!!!!!! If you are embarrassed by kp try this lotion!!!! And there is no funky odor, it smells like most unscented lotions.</li>
            <li> I have lived in the South all my life and seldom wear shoes around the house and outside to garden. Hence, my crusty heels have developed just like my dad&#x27;s did when he was alive. Most heel remedies are simply petroleum jelly and do soften a bit, but this Ammonium Lactate actually worked and with regular application continues to help my rough, crusty heels look a little more presentable.</li>
            <li> I have keratin pilaris (chicken bump skin) on my arms. The dermo told me to buy lotions with the ammonium lactate active ingredient. For me, this product didn&#x27;t work and actually made my bumps more red and noticeable. Perhaps I have a slight allergy to it - I don&#x27;t know. But it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I have dry sensitive skin on my arms and legs. This product was recommended by my dermatologist and I am very pleased with the results.  It provides a slight acid peel and moisturizes at the same time.  I&#x27;ve only been using it for a couple of months.  I hope the results improve my skin tone even more long term.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended AmLac lotion for my dry skin.  This is a generic brand, but it is excellent and worked very well.  It stopped the winter itch I had and is less expensive than the name brand, AmLac.</li>
            <li> I did not try it...it has parabens - very bad.  The ingredient list did not state the parabens... off I go to search for another lactic acid lotion again!!</li>
            <li> Good deal.  Works wonderfully as a body lotion, but too strong for the face, as to be expected.  I use it everyday, and especially when the weather is dry.</li>
            <li> Works well on dry skin, but does leave a little sticky feel for several minutes. Let dry on the skin before dressing.</li>
            <li> This was a script and worked well then I found that I can now buy it over the counter for dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have try lot of different kind lotion in the past, nothing work like this one. Althought this lotion smell is not for everyone.</li>
            <li> used for several years by recommendation of dermatologist.  It is awesome and more reasonably prices on this site.  Your skin will feel as soft as a baby and it does not leave all greasy.</li>
            <li> The container logo-design is different than the one advertized here.&lt;br /&gt;I have dry skin on my lower leg areas.  It helped moisturize a little bit.  I think, I had high expectation after reading the good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;It has a very light smell of ammonium, but that didn&#x27;t bother me from wearing the cream.  I didn&#x27;t give it 5 start because I think this product can be improved.</li>
            <li> great seller, easy transaction! great price on this item that I use daily.  Would recommend it for everyone who has dry skin issues.  no smell too!</li>
            <li> The product is bit smelly, but it seems to be the only thing that works with my mild eczema.  It does take a few weeks though to see results and it seems to get worse before it gets better.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist gave me a prescription for this and I was charged $48.00 for a smaller bottle of the same stuff at my local pharmacy, so the next time I needed a bottle, I bought this product. It does the exact same job as the other stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li> Remarkable difference on my skin !! cleared up dry , flaky areas within a week!! highly recommend this to anyone with dry skin! throw away everything else!!!</li>
            <li> As I get older, so does my skin. Bummer.  I get inflamed, itchy patches that just don&#x27;t go away. This product really helps.</li>
            <li> This works as well as the brand name product, Amlactin, and has reduced the rough discolored spots on my legs</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for years, at the suggestion of my dermatologist. Great product!!</li>
            <li> a miracle drug for my hands. my dermatologist recommended and this product works well. I can highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I am bothered with itchy shins. Dry skin. This is the only moisturizer I&#x27;ve found that cures my problem</li>
            <li> I purchased ammonium lactate from kaiser and it contained 3 parabens.  the ingredients listed on this item did not show any parabens.yet the bottle sent to me is exactly the same, contains the 3 parabens -- returning this product for full refund!</li>
            <li> This is the best hand lotion I have ever used.  I first started using it 25 years ago when a dermatologist prescribed it for me.  It was very expensive then but now that it&#x27;s no longer by prescription only,  anyone can afford it.  A bottle will last a very long time because you only use a very little bit at a time.  It doesn&#x27;t have a pleasant smell but it certainly does the job.</li>
            <li> This product really works.  I have tried soooo many lotions and this one is the first one I am really satified with!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Use this to keep your feet nice and soft. It doesn&#x27;t have the most pleasant smell but it&#x27;s not greasy and softens skin.</li>
            <li> It worked very well on my dry skin</li>
            <li> i am stunned that i can see a difference in my kp after only a few days. so far, i have appled it a few times a day. at 46 i became so used to bumpy skin that i thought it was hopeless. i dont know if it will completely go away, but i am pleased with the improvement so far.</li>
            <li> Keeps my skin surprisingly moist.</li>
            <li> This product works.  It helps hydrate dry skin.  It was recommended to me by my dermatologist, so I knew it would be good.</li>
            <li> Doc gave me rx for Ammonium lactate.  Was $44 for 4 oz.  Decided to check Amazon first.  Same product-different name.  No Rx needed and a fraction of the price. Fantastic moisturizer - especially in dry winter months and in summer after exposure to sun.  Gave it 4 stars only because it takes a while to absorb into skin, and I&#x27;m always in a hurry.</li>
            <li> I, as a general rule, don&#x27;t write reviews. But for the love of god you should NOT USE THIS LOTION. Or Amlactin. I have kp and was using it for a few years. At first only a few people could notice the smell, I was one of them, and it smelled worse than death to me. I would say I was in the vast minority -- maybe 3-5% of people could smell it, to the rest it just smelled like lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over time I got used to it, since it didn&#x27;t bother anyone else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, last year, I don&#x27;t know if the ingredients changed or what, but suddenly everything it touched started smelling horrible a few weeks later. And now about 70% of people could smell it (not me, though, because my nose had become immune to the smell).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway my friends started refusing to come in my dorm room, or be within 10 feet of my doorway, because the smell was so horrible, and even though I used it at night my day clothes smelled like it so my friends stopped letting me come in their rooms because when I sat down the smell came off of my clothes and onto the furniture (apparently).&lt;br /&gt;They also wouldn&#x27;t hug me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally realized what exactly it was (I couldn&#x27;t tell originally, because the smell takes a couple weeks to appear, and again, I couldn&#x27;t smell it anymore), so I washed and drycleaned EVERYTHING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I moved into a suite this fall with people I had never met before. And they immediately were horrified by the smell that actually made them sick. It quickly became apparent (and yes I am 100% sure. There is not a question here at all) that it was still everything the ammonium lactate had touched, because there&lt;br /&gt;IS NO WAY TO GET RID OF THE SMELL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had to throw out thousands upon thousands of dollars worth of stuff because there is quite literally no way to clean it (that I&#x27;ve been able to find.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My choice is having friends or my belongings, so I&#x27;m having to trash, like, everything. I can&#x27;t smell it, but 70% or more of people are horribly upset by it (and yes, I&#x27;ve asked dozens of people, had blind smelling tests -- that is what is going on. Not debatable. It&#x27;s objective.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are dead set on using this lotion maybe, maybe -- I don&#x27;t know, if you washed everything it touched immediately after it would be okay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So yah, basically anything with Ammonium lactate on the ingredient list -- STAY AWAY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is so completely and utterly not worth it. I might sue them (but probably not b/c I&#x27;m in college. You should if this has happened to you.)</li>
            <li> I have used this lotion for years, on my knees &amp; elbows. It keeps these \\&quot;rougher\\&quot; skin areas very soft.</li>
            <li> This product plumps up my skin and gives it a soft touch.  I have given one bottle to a friend who said it was a better moisturizer than the $80 formula she was using.  I leave my skin damp and then apply it so it has the added benefit of even more moisture.  When I use Retin A , I apply this lotion over it so the retin A is not as drying.</li>
            <li> My Dermatologist recommended this as I have extraordinary dry skin.  I put it on after my shower then cover it with a light layer of vasoline.</li>
            <li> My husband uses the ammonium lactate lotion for itchy legs in the winter months.&lt;br /&gt;Has worked better than anything else he has tried.</li>
            <li> I have dedicated myself to getting rid of my keratosis pilaris (kp).  I exfoliate nightly by dry brushing my skin and apply this lotion twice a day.  It has only been a week and I am noticing a difference in the appearance and feel of my skin.  The lotion will tingle on any broken skin, so exfoliate gently.  The smell takes some getting used to but fades quickly after application.  I am willing to live with the smell because it is one of the few things that works on my kp.</li>
            <li> I HAVE RECOMMENDED THIS LOTION TO OTHERS I HAVE BEEN USING IT FOR YEARS.&lt;br /&gt;I WOULD TELL EVERYONE TO GET THIS AS THE ONLY LOTION FOR DRY SKIN</li>
            <li> So now I know why I have been smelling that urine smell; it is this product. The smell isn&#x27;t great when you put it on, but it is sticky and I found it was difficult to get dressed if I put it on after my shower, so then I would put it on before I went to sleep.  Then this scent of urine developed in my room--even after changing the sheets, etc.  There is this lingering faint scent of urine.  I asked my son if anyone brought a cat or dog in the house (because we don&#x27;t have pets).  He would come in my room, and make this weird wincing face.  I asked him what was the matter; he said, \\&quot;it stinks in here.\\&quot; Thought it might be the fermenting tea/kefir, so I stopped doing that.  No animals, no ferments... but still a faint scent of urine.  Now I know what it is; it is this product.  I do have a mattress topper, so if I can&#x27;t get the scent out with a good airing of the mattress topper and a heavy dose of baking soda, I guess I will have to get rid of the mattress topper and get a new one (but it was costly, so I hate to do that).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it work?  Yeah, it works (which is why I gave it a 2 stars instead of 1), but not well enough for me to use something else instead.  I started making my own products when I became more conscious of all the harmful ingredients in things, so I think I have developed the perfect natural replacement for this product for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you choose to use it (and I don&#x27;t recommend anything with parabens in it, which is in this product), then decide which you would rather permeate with an ammnia/urine smell:  your clothes or your bed.  I know most of you think it doesn&#x27;t leave a smell, but it does... you just can&#x27;t smell it because you are in it all the time (and even good friends won&#x27;t tell you you smell like pee).  I think it probably affects some people more than others (possibly due to the acid/alkaline level of your skin, etc.)</li>
            <li> Suggested by my dermatologist and I use it night and day on my face. It works great and less expensive than some of the bigger brands of face cream.  Supposed to help with the wrinkles and I have few of them but use it anyway.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin and/or suffer with dry, chapped skin, this lotion is the answer! Apply in small amounts, get amazing results. Been using for over a year now &amp; still loving it!</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping! Product as described and well packaged! Thank you!</li>
            <li> This is one of the best products I&#x27;ve used for itchy, dry skin.  It immediately soothes the skin, and the soothing action remains for a good long while. I like the fact that it&#x27;s not trying to force oil into your skin, but rather, it&#x27;s laying down a barrier that lets your skin hold on to the water that&#x27;s in it.  In other words, it&#x27;s hydrating.  I know some cosmetic-type creams claim to hydrate, but 12% ammonium lactate lotion actually does it. I&#x27;m guessing that&#x27;s because that&#x27;s all it&#x27;s DESIGNED to do.  A simple product with a simple mission.  For me, anyway, hydration is the key.  I can slather oil-based lotions on until I&#x27;m fairly dripping with it, but there&#x27;s no lasting effect.  Ammonium lactate, on the other hand, has actually changed the nature and quality of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;The only caveat is not to get it in your eyes or on your lips.  But that&#x27;s not a problem -- just something to keep in mind if you&#x27;re using it on your face.</li>
            <li> No complaints whatever ... quick delivery as promised.</li>
            <li> this lotion takes the itch out immediately and heals super dry skin.  i paid 35.00 for a much smaller size at Walmart.</li>
            <li> My podiatrist recommended this lotion for extremely dry skin and callouses.  I went to purchase at my local Target store and it was twice the price, so I decided to use Pricegrabber and check around. This was the lowest price with free shipping ( I purchased the necessarily $35 in products to qualify for the free shipping.  So far, I am very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> Not a bad product but I like Amylactin better, seems to hydrate more and last longer when applied before you to bed.</li>
            <li> My Arthritis Specialist recommended this lotion.  It has helped so I have a tube of it&lt;br /&gt;that I take with me to the pool and use it after my shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the lotion every day.</li>
            <li> I suffer EVERY winter from unbelievable itchy skin - I have for years...and nothing seemed to help.  This lotion has been a life-saver!  I recommend it highly!</li>
            <li> Do not use on legs after shaving!! It burns like heck!!!!!! Other than that, it works pretty well on my bumpy skin, when used sparingly. It is pretty sticky, so plan on hanging out for a good 20 before you go anywhere. Better to use at night i think.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time. Great product. Will buy again. Of several I have tried, this is the best. Good value as well.</li>
            <li> I use it for my dry, cracked hands overnight only and it does work - the smell needs a lot to be desired but then again if they added fragrance, they would have to add alcohol and that drying.</li>
            <li> This product has moisturized and vastly improved my scaly-looking skin. So glad my dermatologist recommended it. It has even helped reduce my psoriasis.</li>
            <li> I have been using this lotion for my keratosis pilaris.  So far I have been using it daily for 1 1/2 months and with continued use it really does make my skin feel softer and smoother.  I recommend it to anyone who has rough or bumpy skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with Keratosis Pilaris for years, in the backs of my arms &amp; legs. No amount of exfoliating, lotions or acne medicines helped. This product though... I&#x27;ve had it for about 2 weeks &amp; already my skin has improved. My skin already feels smoother &amp; the redness &amp; bumps have almost completely gone away. My skin condition embarrassed me way too much especially during the summer days. Now I&#x27;m not worried about it now that I know this product exists &amp; you can&#x27;t beat the price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I&#x27;ve been doing is using a soft loofa in the shower &amp; exfoliate the problem areas to open up the pores. Then once I pat myself dry, I apply the lotion. It seems easier to apply &amp; takes less product right after a warm shower rather than applying when your skin is completely dry. Once it&#x27;s absorbed into the skin it does feel sticky so putting on tight jeans or leggings is more of a challenge.</li>
            <li> FANTASTIC! If you have dry scaly hands, this will fix that up after only one application. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I used to have a really bad eczema, but thanks to this product, I almost do not have that problem anymore. As soon as i get the itch and the first signs of eczema start appearing, I apply this product for couple of days and its gone. Love this product! I even use it on a regular basis sometimes, because it leaves my skin super soft!</li>
            <li> Very good on dry skin.</li>
            <li> dont care much for the smell....to chemical smelling!</li>
            <li> the lotion causes a minor sting when it is applied.  Otherwise. it does the job of stopping the itching from eczema.</li>
            <li> This product works every bit as well as the name brand Ammonium Lactate lotion for less than half the cost. After 2 weeks of use all my flaky dry skin is gone. There is no offensive sour odor like I experienced with other brands. I will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> first time using this product, really helps with my complexion. Has a slight ammonia smell at first but goes away after a few minutes. I use it on my face, dont use it too often in that area, it might cause excessive peeling.</li>
            <li> For those of you looking for a cheaper alternative to Amlactin (or other similar lotions) as I was, this definitely fits the bill. It works just as well (for me maybe even a little better) and as it is a bit thicker than classic Amlactin I find that I&#x27;m able to use less of it overall which further extends its use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did initially find this to be an even stickier lotion than some others in its category so there is even more of an adjustment period off the bat; for those unfamiliar with these type of lotions it may increase the likelihood of being put off by the initial feel (hang in there - they work!). But after using this lotion in place of Amlactin for a few weeks I&#x27;m quite pleased and will continue to purchase this instead.</li>
            <li> Best exfoliating lotion I have tried- I have tried a lactic, aquaglycolic, alpha hydrox, as well as many Eucerin products. This ones works the best on the keratosis pilaris areas I have at the back of my arms and upper thighs. It works like magic on my calloused heals as well. I no longer need a pumice stone. The package is generic, but the product is the best quality, not to mention price, I have found. I subscribed to subscribe and save on this for even better savings. I love this product. It really helps my 51 year old skin.</li>
            <li> The product do a good job takes a few weeks to work. But ,it did work! Thank you again for your help.</li>
            <li> The title pretty much says it all.  I found the product to be very mild and highly moisturizing.  My skin is so soft and smooth now, and it appears to be helping slightly with the texture and appearance of some of my stretch marks.  The only criticism would be the less than stellar, somewhat medicinal smell.</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion to treat my bumpy arms, according to the Internet Gods, I probably have &amp;#34;Keratosis Pilaris&amp;#34; and this lotion is recommended to alleviate the symptoms of the skin condition. Well, it&#x27;s super sticky which is a gross feeling any time of day but especially bad if you&#x27;re about to dress or get in bed. The sticky feeling never seems to go away, either. It also has a strange smell, as someone who likes to smell girly and floral, that was a big turn off. I couldn&#x27;t tell you if it works because I couldn&#x27;t stand putting it on my skin for more than 2 days straight.</li>
            <li> This lotion smwelles a little funny, but it works for the dryness of the skin, the price is correct, thank you</li>
            <li> If you are using this product for keratosis pilaris...you will have to use it likely twice a day every day in order to see any results. This product is just as good quality as AmLactin (actually, I saw better results with this product than with the brand name product), and at a MUCH better price per ounce. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Love the results from this...and the price.  Usually buy the pharmacutecial brand, but this is as good as the other, only costs less.  Go for it!</li>
            <li> Works just as well as the expensive brand and gets your heels soft</li>
            <li> Excellent for dry skin, non grease at all, You can see the different just in two or three days!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried neumerous products for my KP, and many left my arms feeling greasy.  While this hasn&#x27;t cleared it up 100%, it&#x27;s much better than with anything else I&#x27;ve tried, and my arms aren&#x27;t dry (like they are when I use nothing).  I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months now and don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m even through half the bottle.  Great product to try if nothing else has worked for your KP</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this lotion and it works great for my dry skin, especially in the winter.  It soaks right in and is not the least bit greasy.</li>
            <li> good product at a good price</li>
            <li> This lotion does the job. It clears up the little bumps on the backs of my arms and moisturizes my dry feet so well. Love it</li>
            <li> Originally received the lotion as a prescription from a dermatologist.  My chest and arms were flaky and spotted with red or brown discolorations.  Using this product reduced  the problem by 80 %.</li>
            <li> I use this all over, including my face. Be sure to wear sunscreen and keep this out of your eyes.</li>
            <li> Best lotion ever for dry skin.  I was amazed I could get it without a prescription.  Used it every day f</li>
            <li> Works great on my old lady feet, nothing else gets rid the dry scaley skin like this does, better than using pumice which makes the skin look more ragged.</li>
            <li> Sent promptly and as advertised.  This is a good product at a more reasonable price than when locally seen on the shelves..</li>
            <li> I love this lotion.  Before I started using it, my legs were dry and flakey.  Now I never have that problem!  I usually mix it with a less expensive brand that smells really good, although this lotion doesn&#x27;t smell bad.  I do that to make it last longer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this for a couple days so far, but I notice a big different in the red bumps on my leg (I am testing it on just one to see how effective it is).  My skin feels remarkably smoother on the one leg - it&#x27;s even easier to shave!  The product does have a faint smell - almost like Elmer&#x27;s glue - but it is not very strong and easily overpowered by my regular skin cream&#x27;s scent.  I like that this was cheaper than the &amp;#34;name brand.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This product is excellent for softening cracked feet! I used it and within one week, I noticed a very remarkable difference. Now my feet are as smooth as can be.&lt;br /&gt;Seller was beyond prompt in delivery and product came sooner than the anticipated time. Great bonus! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Great for dry skin. No perfume smell. It is scent free.</li>
            <li> This lotion seems pretty moisturizing, although maybe a tad sticky if you over apply. I bought it for k.p. and I don&#x27;t notice a huge difference with mine, like some of the other reviewers have. Although, I only used it about a week and a half so far. Everyone has different type skins though, so for the price, give it a try. If nothing else, it seems like a decent lotion and the bottle is pretty large. You don&#x27;t have to use much of this product either, so it will last pretty well.</li>
            <li> A very good lotion for very dry skin.  Arrived on time and as advertised.</li>
            <li> Doctor subscribed this for me and was a lot cheaper than the drug store. To bad it doesn&#x27;t cure dry skin but does help.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years as a Rx from my family doctor. I&#x27;d been searching for it at Walgreens but had to settle for another brand with the same ingredients I thought. This brand is far more effective in moisturing. I was delighted to find this source when I went on line..... and I paid less too!</li>
            <li> This item used to be by subscription only.  Does not take a lot for positive results.  I used it on a burn and was very pleased with the results.  It&#x27;s not greasy and has no scent. Works well on dry skin or cracks in heels.  Very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice lotion that works well for softening skin, especially dry winter skin. Also diminishes those pesky bumps that seem to love my upper arms.  I admit, I haven&#x27;t been using it religiously, but now that summer is here, I am beginning to use it more often.  It&#x27;s been great on my dry, flaky legs!  Good purchase.</li>
            <li> if you exfoliate first even mildly, it will sting.</li>
            <li> Love this. Works great on my feet and dried up heels. Makes them soft after a couple applications.</li>
            <li> My wife has been using this lotion for a long time and it works for her.</li>
            <li> Bought this for dry cracking feet.  After a short period of time feet are back to normal.  Works as well as name brand costing much more.</li>
            <li> it helps my skin condition very much.  I use it all the time.  I have used it for years. love it</li>
            <li> I bought this after some research on the red bumps on my arms. I was very excited to get this big of a bottle for a great price. I did notice a difference, but found that just being in the sun works way better. I find this to be a little tacky after use, but there was no bad smell, which was a bonus. I continue to use it because i do find that it helps some.</li>
            <li> It does have a unique smell and is slight sticky, but this is to be expected with any lactate lotion. The smell does linger a bit, but not for the entire day. Overall great product, and just bought another pack of it.</li>
            <li> I love this product because it works, and it&#x27;s reasonably priced. I use it on the face, but as a body lotion as well.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> I have used ammonium lactate lotion 12% before.  This one smelled like Elmer&#x27;s glue, and even burned my skin.  Couldn&#x27;t return due to rules of sale.  Not a winner!</li>
            <li> When you know what ingredients to look for, you can save lots of money. I&#x27;m absolutely giddy over finding this! It&#x27;s a wonderful product!</li>
            <li> Helped my dry skin, but yuck - left me feeling sticky all day.  Don&#x27;t want to use it again.</li>
            <li> Smells &amp; does not absorb well, but when I do use it it seems to help. Gold Bond Rough &amp; Bumpy seems to work better without the annoying smell, though.</li>
            <li> The Rx charges 60.00 good deal.</li>
            <li> Works very good for my dry skin. Doctor recommended.</li>
            <li> Expensive, but worth it and cheaper than name brand.  They require  a minimum amount of words for their reviews...okay that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> I am very thankful to have found this! Out of all the products I have purchased for my KP this stuff has been the best. It has not all gone away but it&#x27;s been enough for me to notice and feel a difference. I&#x27;m sure if I actually used it once or twice a day it would actually be even more beneficial.</li>
            <li> Great lotion for a reasonable price. It started working by the 3rd day. It speeds up exfoliation and peels the top layer very easy with a good loofa!!</li>
            <li> Ammonium lactate equivalent to 12% lactic acid, cetyl alcohol, fragrance, glycerin, glyceryl stearate, laureth-4, light mineral oil, magnesium aluminum silicate, methylcellulose, methylparaben, PEG-100 stearate, polyoxyl 40 stearate, propylene glycol, propylparaben, and purified water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.perrigo.com/files/rx/pdfs/p4-RC0K5A7PI.pdf</li>
            <li> Have used this product for years and it is excellent for dry hardened skin.  I have sjogren&#x27;s and icthiosis and this product softens the skin cells so they will come off in the shower, leaving skin softer looking.</li>
