            <li>The color is great.</li>

            <li> True black.</li>
            <li> No dripping, no mess.</li>
            <li> I find it easy to use thanks to the comb tool attachment it comes with - very few other brands have this.</li>
            <li> Black can be tricky, especially since I&#x27;m a natural blonde.</li>
            <li> I tried several other brands and  finally chose it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this particular product/color for past 7 years.</li>
            <li> I use this product once a month and it covers the grey well.</li>
            <li> Lasts a very long time.  </li>
            <li> My hair is black and very long.</li>
            <li> My hair is long, extremely thick, and very coarse, so I need two boxes for all over.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about a hair color being able to completely cover my gray in 10 minutes but this product proved me wrong.</li>
            <li> only downside is that I still have a few hard to color grays that may peek through, but overall I would say the coverage is excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Shining black color.</li>
            <li> The color stays on for few weeks as mentioned by the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> Unbelievably rich!&lt;br</li>
            <li> My wife usually leave some color on her pillow wheneve</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t stain my scalp blue or smell horrible and it works well.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m going gray at 25. This product makes the pain of my reality more bearable. Very easy, albeit a bit messy. The color is great. Get this!</li>
            <li> Really like this product &amp; really like the way it&#x27;s applied...</li>
            <li> Great product. The color stays on for few weeks as mentioned by the manufacturer. I have been using this particular product/color for past 7 years. The hair stays smooth. The color does not damage the hairs.</li>

My hair is long, extremely thick, and very coarse, so I need two boxes for all over. I love the color (mine is lightest golden brown) and get lots of compliments on the shine.

Also, feel free to ask me any questions about the product you may have. Thank You.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff! Black can be tricky, especially since I&#x27;m a natural blonde. But this is true black...none of that blue based nonsense. True black. Came out shiny and beautiful and washes easily off the skin. Buying more now for my future touch ups!</li>
            <li> CLAIROL PERFECT 10...... gets a 10 from this buyer.  It&#x27;s so easy to use.  The shades are natural.  Lasts a very long time.  No fading.&lt;br /&gt;  The Seller provides fast shipping also.&lt;br /&gt;AN ABSOLUTE PERFECT 10 !!!!!</li>
            <li> This is  really a perfect 10. I find it easy to use thanks to the comb tool attachment it comes with - very few other brands have this. And all it takes is 10 minutes compared to the time others that I have tried take. Great price on Amazon..</li>
            <li> This is one of the best I have ever used. Shining black color. The paste after combining is sticky enough. No dripping, no mess.</li>
            <li> The best hair color I&#x27;ve ever used. It really works it ten minutes, even on the stubborn greys, and the results are salon quality! Perfect 10 is easy to use and provides superior results!  My hair has never looked better. I am thrilled to have found a hair color of this caliber that actually works in ten minutes and lasts for months!</li>
            <li> Sometime this box is on sale in the stores so keep an eye out but this deal is pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;I love this 10 min deal, great for touch ups. Make sure to get your frame on your face and then comb it out and leave it the 10 mins but don&#x27;t bunch it up because it can shift the color. All around great dye for an at home dye kit in a box. Smells great, great price and time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get it girl!!!</li>
            <li> Clairol Perfect 10 By Nice &#x27;N Easy Hair Color 002 is my favorite one. I tried several other brands and  finally chose it. it is really easy and  impressively colored my hair  within 10 mins. I love it.</li>
            <li> Colors and conditions my hair beautifully, so going through the process of getting out the gray every three weeks isn&#x27;t so traumatic. The finished product is shiny, beautiful, no-gray hair.</li>
            <li> Love that it only takes 10 minutes. I can&#x27;t get this in my local Walmart any more, so glad I found it here. Covers very well.</li>
            <li> My wife usually leave some color on her pillow wheneve she dye her hair.&lt;br /&gt;this product is so good. it is really good , it didn&#x27;t mess up anything. strong recommend it.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about a hair color being able to completely cover my gray in 10 minutes but this product proved me wrong. It was such a pleasure using this product. The adaptable nozzle makes application a breeze. I will definitely be using Clairol Perfect 10 for all my touch ups in the future. Great product. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love this dye. Wish I could find it locally.</li>
            <li> The only dye I will use on my hair. Most people I encounter think the color is natural. Amazing coverage and staying power!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 40 years old and I just recently started dyeing my hair. My hair is black and very long. I use this product once a month and it covers the grey well. I use the conditioner that comes with it every now and then, but the quality of my hair has been fine without using it.</li>
            <li> I love this t0 minute hair color.  There is no distributor in the Seattle area any more.  I get a 2 pack from Amazon automatically every two months.  If you sign up for automatic delivery of routinely used items, you get 5% off.  It arrives like clockwork.  About the time I think about needing it, it is on my doormat!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t stain my scalp blue or smell horrible and it works well. In the sun I can still see brown undertone which is why it&#x27;s a 4 star but I like it enough I have used it for years.</li>
            <li> Perfect jet black hair color that lasts and covers greys!</li>
            <li> Very good quality and fast shipping</li>
    </ol>
