            <li>Glad I ordered them.</li>

            <li>They were easy to put on and take off.</li>
            <li>I think they will love the pretty designs and easy application.</li>
            <li>they were super easy to apply and stayed on overnight.</li>

            <li> The only reason I&#x27;m giving four stars instead of five is because they are just a little too big for a little girl&#x27;s (or boy&#x27;s) hand.</li>
            <li> lasted less than 2 days</li>
            <li> They are about the size of a half dollar.</li>
            <li> Other temporary tattoos we have had in the past</li>
            <li> a bit boring as there are only 6 different designs and the set has 144 tats...</li>
            <li> Disappointed.  </li>

            <li> These made cute party favors for my 4-year-old&#x27;s princess party. They come in a big stack of individual tattoos with 24 of each of the six styles. The only reason I&#x27;m giving four stars instead of five is because they are just a little too big for a little girl&#x27;s (or boy&#x27;s) hand. They are sized more for an adult-sized hand, I think. Still, you get a large quantity for a low price. I&#x27;m happy!</li>
            <li> Worked great. They were a hit!</li>
            <li> These tattoos look nice and my daughter loved them but they only last a day before washing off.  Other temporary tattoos we have had in the past last much longer.  And we didn&#x27;t even put these on her hands which get frequent washing, more up on her arm.  Disappointed.  THe only good thing is that there are a ton in the package so we could put a new one on every day and still have tattoos for a while.</li>

            <li> a bit boring as there are only 6 different designs and the set has 144 tats... would have liked a bit more variety. however, my daughter loved them and was so excited to have me put them on her. they were super easy to apply and stayed on overnight. lasted less than 2 days but i didn&#x27;t need them to last longer</li>
