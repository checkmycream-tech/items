            <li>I won&#x27;t be ordering more.</li>
            <li>I have switched mostly to electric these days</li>
            <li>Love gillette razors..</li>
            <li>And it gets better....</li>
            <li>Love this razor and getting blades is always cheaper when you get them in multi-packs of 8 or 12.</li>
            <li>The more in the pack, the cheaper they are.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different brands and found that Gillette is the best.</li>
            <li>My favorite manual shaver for once a week.</li>
            <li>the ad on tv said it would cost me 52.00 a year at the price u sell the blades it going to cost me alot more then that</li>
            <li>Much more cost efficient than buying a pack of 4 or 8 retail.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>So glad I bought this on a refill cycle.</li>
            <li>Outstanding</li>
            <li>Price is ok.</li>
            <li>love Gillette product line, Gillette Fusion is my favorite.</li>
            <li>Excellent price, especially when you set it up through the subscribe and save program and automatic delivery system!</li>
            <li>These Gillette Fusion Manual Men&#x27;s Razor Blade Refills are a sure buy for me again as I have been using them for years</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for more than 2 years</li>
            <li>For years I have been saying these cartridges are a total rip off, but they are the best!!!</li>
            <li>I am sure there are premium competitors that might do the trick, but Gillette is never standing still.  </li>
            <li>99 percent of all the stuff i order from i love it works out for both of use .</li>
            <li>I have purchased these multiple times on amazon since it has the best deal.</li>
            <li>Much better.  </li>
            <li>I threw them away and brought these - and it is so much better.  </li>
            <li>These have been my razor blades of choice for many years.  </li>
            <li>The added time of use more the outweighs the increase in cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Tried to save more money by switching to cheaper blades/razors, and ended up with cuts on my face and head (I shave that too).  </li>
            <li>...the only way to buy fusion blades - great price!</li>
            <li>these are a fantastic price!</li>
            <li>I love these blades, I&#x27;m a girl</li>
            <li>guys check out YOUTUBE on better shave and save life of blades.</li>
            <li>Helps to get these blades at a better price.</li>
            <li>Everyone seems to be going to the &amp;#34;safety razor&amp;#34; shaves these days, but I haven&#x27;t been able to bring myself to move away from the Fusion.  </li>
            <li>Having 12 means I don&#x27;t have to think about getting more any time soon.</li>
            <li>Will order more soon,</li>
            <li>Not that much better than a 2,3, or 4 bladed razor</li>
            <li>Way better than the Mach 3</li>
            <li>Much better than the 2 blade disposable I have been using.</li>
            <li>Have had this razor for many years, and I love it.  </li>
            <li>Make sure not to get the electric if you dont need.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize until now I had been using a slightly better line of Gillette Fusion blades.  </li>
            <li>I can each cartridge for a month or more.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t you love paying $4 per cartridge?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am so glad I got to try this product</li>
            <li>and now people have an option for a better product.  </li>
            <li>So much better pricing in Amazon than in store purchase.</li>
            <li>Definitely the best brand razor blades on the market.</li>
            <li>And yes it is more</li>
            <li>Such a great product!</li>
            <li>My husband likes these blades and I&#x27;ll order more.</li>
            <li>I love these blades and boy</li>
            <li>Better price than I could find anywhere.</li>
            <li>My husband loves his Gillette Fusion Razor and love the cartridges as well, he doesn&#x27;t tend to throw the blade away after the strip fades because he feels there is life to the blade.</li>
            <li>fit in my hand nice.</li>
            <li>So much more convenient than having to shop when I run out.</li>
            <li>These are great blades they just cost way to much.  </li>
            <li>but they still cost more than I care to pay.  </li>
            <li>I could not be more pleased.  </li>
            <li>Love the razor and the blades.....</li>
            <li>Others were OK.  </li>
            <li>Still my favorite razors.</li>
            <li>I end up with more ingrowns that way as well.</li>
            <li>They are better -</li>
            <li>Love every thing about it.</li>
            <li>Honestly, the original Fusion blades are better then the newer ProGlides, which are interchangeable on any Fusion handle.</li>
            <li>Except for the high price, they are very good and smooth shaving.</li>
            <li>The same great razors at an exceptional price.</li>
            <li>They give a nice clean shave.</li>
            <li>Nice, clean shaven legs.</li>
            <li>Great shave at a high price.  </li>
            <li>We keep buying them though because they are great, which keeps the price high</li>
            <li>SAY HOW LONG AND ONE OF THE DAY I FOUND BEST PRICE</li>
            <li>The DSC blades were good on the first use but always felt like they were pulling hair.</li>
            <li>If you are willing to pay the price, these blades do a good job.</li>
            <li>I think it was a pretty good value.</li>
            <li>best thing I bought in a long time!</li>
            <li>These blades came in brand new packaging, and looked great upon arrival.  </li>
            <li>ive used it a few times now, just to keep her happy, and its worked great.</li>
            <li>love it.&lt;br /&gt;Comfortable and easy to use,&lt;br</li>
            <li>Yet, if you can make a razor 12 pack last a year, and they&#x27;re so cheap on Amazon, why not buy the best?</li>
            <li>I had been using the sensor excel for the last 15 years, then Gillette sent me this for free in the mail and it works great!</li>
            <li>2nd time ordering and will order again, great product at a nice savings.</li>
            <li>Great, nice and simple and protective.&lt;br /&gt;Would buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li>Love em fast delivery good price.</li>
            <li>Great price on great blades and the eco-box shipping works just fine holding the extra blade cartridges until you need to swap in a fresh blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE the shave I get with the Fusion blades, and it works on the powered and unpowered handle just fine.</li>
            <li>I think they&#x27;re the best, but they&#x27;re not THAT much better than other razors.</li>
            <li>Great deal, good price, beats every other razor (hands-down) for my husband.</li>
            <li>These ones do not glide smoothly, I need to pull the razor and it makes scraping sound!</li>
            <li>This eliminates razor burn for me and results in a more comfortable shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>love his smooth face.&lt;br /&gt;Love.</li>
            <li>These are most definitely genuine Gillette Fusion blades.  </li>
            <li>I am a man and love a smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>Closest most comfortable shave</li>
            <li>These are good refills my husband thought that it was very convenient to use and they arrived within days</li>
            <li>Always a nice close shave an no cuts, even on a fresh blade</li>
            <li>Very convenient and $$$ was good</li>
            <li>Pay more and get the real blades and leave these alone!!!</li>
            <li>like how the blade assembly follows my face and provides a good shave by keeping the blades at the right angle and in full contact with my skin.  </li>
            <li>Super awesome price for the same thing you buy at the store.</li>
            <li>like the product, they are in handy came at right price</li>
            <li>It looks nice and is priced right.</li>
            <li>It does a great job on facial hair and is very comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>Awesome and as expected!</li>
            <li>so I went ahead and ordered (since I knew I could return easily with Amazon).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to replace these blade refills, and their package make it convenient for storing them.</li>
            <li>The refills are easy to use.</li>
            <li>The refills come out of the package easily and effortlessly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jeff614</li>
            <li>Easy to take out of the cartridge, easy to recognize when to re-place the blade.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to use and customize.  </li>
            <li>I get 6 weeks to two months from each blade, easily.</li>
            <li>Easy to replace heads on fusion products.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I loved the individual product, and the subscription feature is just as amazing.</li>
            <li>These blades provide me with 5-8 good shaves before they need to be replaced...much better than the lifespan of my old safety razors.</li>
            <li>It is so easy to switch cartridges.</li>
            <li>-- shave is much better and closer, blades last longer, skin looks great after shaving.  </li>
            <li>Also, the easy packaging is helpful as well.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with it and the Razor works significantly better than many other cheaper razors out there.</li>
            <li>Even with a new blade you can feel the difference and after you have shaved, take a good look at your face and you will see and feel the pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stay</li>
            <li>Love them and wouldn&#x27;t trade them for a different kind!</li>
            <li>Totally fine product.</li>
            <li>what can I say, they work fine.</li>
            <li>Seem to work fine.</li>
            <li>These are fine razors but they&#x27;re so overpriced.</li>
            <li>These are a great shave, as long as you are okay with taking out a mortgage on your house to afford these refills.</li>
            <li>When I got the blades the packaging was fine.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>works fine as the shaver itself.</li>
            <li>Super deal!</li>
            <li>These glide easily over the skin and are easy to clean as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very comfortable shave and rarely a nick.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s well established that drying the blades will HUGELY extend the life of the cartridge.</li>
            <li>- the blade itself is a rare product that works maybe better than advertised.</li>
            <li>Great quality, these are the only blades my husband will use.</li>
            <li>No cuts, smooth shaving</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;- 5 blades makes the process smooth</li>
            <li>Delivered on the same day and in great shape.</li>
            <li>Something was off--they didn&#x27;t feel as smooth as raisers from the store...</li>
            <li>Always smooth results..and</li>
            <li>i think these blades may be genuine, but I&#x27;m guessing they are genuine for regions where Gillette sells lower-grade blades.</li>
            <li>However, the amazon price is great (especially with subscribe &amp; save).</li>
            <li>(yeah, those free mail offerings with a shaver for Gillette got me)</li>
            <li>Great deal compared to what you find in your standard grocery/drug stores.  </li>
            <li>I refuse to pay prices at the supermarket and drug stores or go through all the madness of getting it cheap at Costco.</li>
            <li>This item is currently available from Costco</li>
            <li>shave is close, comfortable and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I believe them to be genuine.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s genuine or not.</li>
            <li>My husband shaves his head a few times per week and these are the best blades he has found.  </li>
            <li>Genuine Gillette blades.....</li>
            <li>I received the Gillette Fusion razor for free from Gillette and catridge to review and will use again.</li>
            <li>smooth shave</li>
            <li>have a light beard</li>
            <li>All these blades, fit for both facescaping and</li>
            <li>Gillette provided me this product for free for the purpose of trying and reviewing.</li>
            <li>I received this product for free as a bzzagent.</li>
            <li>But overall this is a great razor.</li>
            <li>I picked this up at the store, because i wanted to have more than a month&#x27;s worth of razors for once.</li>
            <li>As a result, a blade is comfortable on my face for a week, then I need to change it out.</li>
            <li>I received the razor for free to try out via Gillette.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin so smooth and the lotion strip makes my skin feel moisturized.</li>
            <li>One pull of the razor across my face makes the skin unbelievably smooth.</li>
            <li>I received this in the mail for free to test and review from Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Never again will I be suckered into buying cheap blades.  </li>
            <li>These might cost more, but well worth it.  </li>
            <li>I received the Gillette fusion blades as a free sample.</li>
            <li>Thank you to Gilette for giving me the Gilette Fusion and cartridge refill free of charge for testing purposes.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy using it.</li>
            <li>Smooth.</li>
            <li>Smooth, no cuts, no scrapes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m switching to the Shick Hydro, as I got a free sample, and the blade there has lasted two, going on three weeks.  </li>
            <li>I wish these were available for subscription</li>
            <li>These cartridges fit both Gillette Fusion and Gillette Fusion Power razors.</li>
            <li>The Gillette fusion manual men does not make me have rushes, because it is smooth on edge.</li>
            <li>Same great blades.</li>
            <li>get the closest smooth shave without nicks and cuts.  </li>
            <li>I also question whether or not these are genuine Gillette Fusion blades.</li>
            <li>My shave is comfortable &amp; close.</li>
            <li>Lives up to the advertisement one refill lasts me up to a month of comfortable close shaves.</li>
            <li>These Gillette blades aren&#x27;t &#x27;cheap&#x27; but they have reliable quality and their longevity makes them a cost-effective choice for customers.</li>
            <li>These razors work well and smooth.  </li>
            <li>No cuts and it is a comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li>However, I now use a double-edged safety razor and really enjoy the ritual of it all.</li>
            <li>yes I seem to be great for the priceI have only use one</li>
            <li>Smoother than rubbing a stick of unsalted butter on your face.</li>
            <li>I have bought a set after I received my free sample from Gillette.</li>
            <li>I received two Fusion razor cartridges from Gillette to try for free.</li>
            <li>is so smooth</li>
            <li>Use Them Daily, Great products</li>
            <li>Great price and each of these blades last me a month.  </li>
            <li>I used cheap disposable razors for years</li>
            <li>He loves the way the blades leave his skin, smooth and not irriated at all.  </li>
            <li>overall the razor was great.</li>
            <li>i really enjoy my razor.</li>
            <li>They are genuine Gillette blades.</li>
            <li>Close, comfortable shave on what ever skin you use them on.</li>
            <li>However, they work great and they seem to last about four or five shaves, for me.  </li>
            <li>Smooth shave, and</li>
            <li>Seems the same great blade...</li>
            <li>Purchased these with the subscribe and save and looks like a good deal so far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried cheaper razors/disposables and most of them are only good for one shave.</li>
            <li>so far so good.</li>
            <li>Good design-I was surprised.</li>
            <li>These are probably marketed overseas at a lower cost, which is fine if that&#x27;s what you are use to, but if you are used to the high grade US version, these really kind of suck.</li>
            <li>I have found to be very useful</li>
            <li>Happy customer  fast shipping decent price......</li>
            <li>so I could enjoy the consistently smooth clean shaves for which I have become accustomed.</li>
            <li>price is high, but each cartridge lasts about a week, and simply provides the best shave money can buy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It stays nice a smooth and cut free for weeks after I start a new blade and with the Sensor</li>
            <li>These are must have if  you want clean smooth shave.</li>
            <li>Clean smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>The blades are super easy to replace.</li>
            <li>Its really nice when you start using new blade but after 2-3 use some blades start hurting and do not give smooth shave.</li>
            <li>The blades arrived in original packaging.</li>
            <li>Love these razors, don&#x27;t be concerned they are the real thing!</li>
            <li>Many Years Ago, when they first came out.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed and a much better price than elsewhere.</li>
            <li>with these razors, purchase Earth Friendly Products Shower Cleaner with Tea Tree Oil from Amazon as well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve canceled my subscription and would rather pay more for higher quality.</li>
            <li>So you already love the brand and the great shave that these blades give you: now you are looking for a reasonable price for the refills, which is the next part of your journey!  </li>
            <li>The razor blades are the original product in the original  packaging.</li>
            <li>The cartridge also has a unique feature.  </li>
            <li>Yes they start out giving a great shave but at $4 a cartridge I expect a little more.</li>
            <li>THE BLADE DOES NOT GIVE A  CLEAN SHAVE.</li>
            <li>I shave my head - so a clean, heavy-duty blade is a must.</li>
            <li>The quality of shave is not at all close and clean and it irritates the skin.</li>
            <li>Gillette offers the best blade on the market and the cost via Amazon beats the local store price.</li>
            <li>If you value a clean shave, this is the way to go.  </li>
            <li>fit as expected and work great.</li>
            <li>and you can bring a 4mm beard to a clean face with few/no next-day pimples.</li>
            <li>It gives me a nice clean shave and feels better than using the regular handle.</li>
            <li>I think they are top of the line for someone who wants a smooth, close, shave without being cut or scraped.</li>
            <li>The single side is great for edging your side burns and those tricky hairs in-between you</li>
            <li>The first one I popped in worked great, such a smooth close save.</li>
            <li>Great value and beats all the other store prices plus is available for Subscribe and Save for the increased discount....</li>
            <li>Somewhere out their their is photographic evidence of a guy going into Walmart to buy razors clean shaven, and coming out with a full beard.</li>
            <li>B004Q6X1E6 Special Sale - 5 Boxes of</li>
            <li>This by far the best razor that I have ever owned my entire life, sharp, clean cut, great price.</li>
            <li>The product is excellent and the service and price is hard to beat.</li>
            <li>the price here on Amazon was by far the best i saw in a long time.</li>
            <li>Thank you for the prompt delivery, great product, what I expected and received.</li>
            <li>They work great - as expected.</li>
            <li>They lasted for almost 12 months; yes, one full year.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t ding them for cost because I still love the result so much.</li>
            <li>Not too much to say, but the Fusion is my favorite razor.</li>
            <li>Good Produst these are like my second order</li>
            <li>But with every razor comes the need for blades (which is what ends up being the true expense of shaving).</li>
            <li>So I was convinced to try dollar shave club after seeing all those cool commercials and checking out the website .So</li>
            <li>Why would you pay full price?</li>
            <li>Sure I could go retro and get a straight razor and strop</li>
            <li>They last a good amount of time.</li>
            <li>have searched for years, trying this product and that for a close shave at a more reasonable cost</li>
            <li>Cool just what I need</li>
            <li>You cannot find the Fusion razor blades anywhere for such a good price.  </li>
            <li>Good deal on a product that I use, daily.  </li>
            <li>Misleading, It&#x27;s not bad, but for whom doesn&#x27;t know the difference between Fusion and Fusion Proglide.</li>
            <li>We have searched and right now, the Subscribe and Save offers the best price compared with our local stores.  </li>
            <li>, make sure you get the right ones for the exact model your handle is or you are stuck.</li>
            <li>Offered a very close and smooth shave and was easy to handle.</li>
            <li>The higher cost is easily off set by the smoothshave and the logevity</li>
            <li>This is another one of the great products that make me cringe whenever I buy them due to the price.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have ordered the fusion cartridges on line and they are working out just fine.</li>
            <li>I was so much impressed with earlier Gillette experience that I did not contact Amazon immediately and kept trying different blades....</li>
            <li>Super value.</li>
            <li>Gillette Fusion gives a nice smooth, longer lasting shave to each blade.&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li>I had a pregnant moment and ordered these.</li>
            <li>This is a great pack and will last we the whole year since I have a blade sharpener too</li>
            <li>The thing that amazes me the most is that these are five blade razors and they work great on me, even though I have really thick hair.</li>
            <li>I bought from walmart and had a different nice smooth shave .</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll be lucky to get 4-5 days out of these blades.</li>
            <li>They work perfectly on my face and prevent me from going over the same spot multiple times.  </li>
            <li>Quick delivery and price for something used frequently/good product.</li>
            <li>The product came quickly.</li>
            <li>trick is this: the alcohol quickly dries out any moisture.</li>
            <li>Gillette was nice enough to send me a free sample.</li>
            <li>Many of them pointed out a relatively high price of these blades.  </li>
            <li>Great Blades... love the extra blade on the back...</li>
            <li>/&gt;While these are not the cheapest blades on the market, I get a week of comfortable shaves out of each blade, with the seventh being as crisp and free of dulling as the first.</li>
            <li>I was able to shave in the shower like I normally do and just used</li>
            <li>Overall I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>I have used it ever since it was first available.</li>
            <li>They are reliably consistent, providing a time-efficient smooth shave.</li>
            <li>This is the first shave system to give me close comfortable shave without nicks and scratches.</li>
            <li>Thank you so very much!  </li>
            <li>Sensitive skin could be easily irritated!</li>
            <li>So with taking care of it by softening my beard with just warm water before shaving and then using just plain soap to lubricate my face before shaving, then washing it out with just warm water, I was able to make \\&quot;ONE Blade\\&quot; LAST almost a FULL YEAR!</li>
            <li>Was literally about to pay more for half as many razors at a store before finding these!</li>
            <li>so I assume they are pleased at always having a new blade when needed.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m pretty bald, so we&#x27;re not talking a full head of full, lustrous hair, here).</li>
            <li>This was the best deal I could find on the 12 count, and this should last me a long time, but I&#x27;m still always a bit baffled by the price.</li>
            <li>Totally worth it with Super Saver Shipping</li>
            <li>The razors are exactly the same, and are of good quality.</li>
            <li>For that kind of money I would prefer that the blade last me a full month instead of three weeks</li>
            <li>/&gt;Gillette; do your homework and come back with a better bullet the put in my razor or get out of the business!</li>
            <li>Love this deal and these are the blades I have ever had for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>These were the Fusion blades, not the Fusion Proglide like pictured, be aware!  </li>
            <li>Costco next time for sure!</li>
            <li>The difference between the two is pretty significant.</li>
            <li>They last a very long time and the cut they give you is AMAZING!!!!</li>
            <li>Even better it comes in an easy to open and store</li>
            <li>It really is frustration free and if you make sure to order directly from amazon you don&#x27;t have to worry about imitations!</li>
            <li>They have the extra blade for more fine shaving around the nose and sideburns.</li>
            <li>This one is good, especially if you shave head or large areas.</li>
            <li>The price is definitely high, but it provides a very nice, comfortable, extremely close shave without the fiddling of a safety razor system.  </li>
            <li>these are real Gillette razor blade cartridges that will fit a variety of their brand of handles.</li>
            <li>and the blades are comfortable and fast to use.  </li>
            <li>You get a great smooth shave every time, and they last awhile before you need to replace each individual cartridge.</li>
            <li>I am very frugal on the borderline cheap.</li>
            <li>It can be the kind of cut you&#x27;ll actually need to pay attention too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>good quality product is what I expected for that price</li>
            <li>I shall finish by saying that my face is smooth as when I was born and still believed in the magic and power of shaving that inevitably lay ahead of me.</li>
            <li>I have used so many different types of Blades until I received a FREE Gillnetter FUSION Razor in the Mail</li>
            <li>And then more recently to FIND OUT that \\&quot;Amazon.com\\&quot; DISCOUNTED this Product (3 4-packs for about $30.00, PLUS FREE Shipping)</li>
            <li>Kind of like what I got ten years ago.</li>
            <li>: I get about a week&#x27;s worth shaves out each blade.</li>
            <li>They are miles better than the old Mach3 blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I guess that&#x27;s to be expected form a good quality product</li>
            <li>The blades give an extra close shave and have been great on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Still, on pricey side but well worth the money.</li>
            <li>They cost but seem so worth it.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>So they are rare.</li>
            <li>The &#x27;glide strip&#x27; does serve a useful function in smoothing out the stroke.  </li>
            <li>far as quality, there aren&#x27;t many complaints</li>
            <li>I rarely get cuts.  </li>
            <li>You get your moneys worth.</li>
            <li>Nice to know that I don&#x27;t have to worry about going to the store; always have what I need especially for the summer time.</li>
            <li>For a while, he tried the mail order kind that has been advertised recently (dollar shave club), but returned to using this product.</li>
            <li>If you shave your head they are worth checking out.</li>
            <li>These are pricey, but worth the money.</li>
            <li>Good price and arrived as expected.  </li>
            <li>These blades give a nice shave, but even with 5 blades on them the shave only lasts for one day.  </li>
            <li>The shaves after the first few are great, but nothing like the first one with the clean fresh blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I keep trying other blades and razors because of the price I have to pay for the Gillette Fusion blades, but I keep going back to the Gillette Fusion - they&#x27;re just the best blades for me.</li>
            <li>The blades are extremely sharp and leave a nice smooth surface after the shave.</li>
            <li>I have tried many other razors and most of them will cut you once in a while</li>
            <li>The resulting shave and comfort has been better than many other disposable cartridges that I have tried.</li>
            <li>Oh well...there in business to make more money for Procter &amp; Gamble, and so much better than other brands.</li>
            <li>other wise</li>
            <li>Right?...</li>
            <li>The right type of blade for me.</li>
            <li>Stop right there.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s right just set your subscription to how often you would like them delivered.  </li>
            <li>quality razors at the right price</li>
            <li>Very nice sharp blade and glides very well.</li>
            <li>New cartridges are easy to install.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought these for my husband because they are so much cheaper online, and they were exactly what he wanted and in amazon&#x27;s frustration free packaging.  </li>
            <li>I easily get 30 shaves out of each blade so it only costs me about 1 dolla a day to use this fine product.</li>
            <li>I started using my razors, I noticed immediately that I was not getting the close and comfortable shave I had with my older razor.  </li>
            <li>This makes it so much easier to clean after use.</li>
            <li>This is a review for the 12 pack, and is mainly to address some concerns from some people that these might not be genuine.</li>
            <li>The cartridge replacement system is very easy and simple.</li>
            <li>First of all, this is my first razor with 5 blades!</li>
            <li>The trimmer piece also stays sharp for much longer, giving a more comfortable and accurate trim for each razor.</li>
            <li>We love the minimum and non-plastic packaging that Amazon offers: all green and all good for the family budget.  </li>
            <li>Even though I used some of my cash-back bonus, the original price wasn&#x27;t that high.  </li>
            <li>Genuine Gillette Fusion Razor Blade Refills, just like the real thing, because they are the real thing.</li>
            <li>Arrived super fast.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the same style razor for a few years, and its quality and longevity are superb.</li>
            <li>I like the single blade for trimming nice lines (ie sideburns).</li>
            <li>Ok - this is short and sweet:  If you&#x27;ve never tried a modern, state-of-the-art razor blade, you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re</li>
            <li>It really depends on how close and smooth of a shave you want, and how much you&#x27;re willing to pay for it.</li>
            <li>the package was shipped and delivered very fast.</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping as well.</li>
            <li>thank you very much</li>
            <li>Not much to say other than it&#x27;s Gillette (the best a man can get).  </li>
            <li>A good shave but seems a little hi priced</li>
            <li>Very fast and consistent.</li>
            <li>The high quality and fair  price are as expected.</li>
            <li>With some occasional experiments with new brands, once I find what works best on my face, changes to other offerings are glacial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very convenient, somewhat economical, and always there when you need them.</li>
            <li>When I did realize that they were defective, I tried to simply exchange them, but was told that I could no longer do so, as it had already been more than 30 days after my purchase.  </li>
            <li>I will going back to buying from the store and when someone does come with a better blade, I will drop Gilette altogether</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t get much closer than this!</li>
            <li>I have found that cleaning the blade with HOT water after each shave lengthens the time between needing a replacement.</li>
            <li>I have used most of the Gillete series of razors going back to the Sensor.</li>
            <li>daughter actually saw them in a Costco and innocently asked me why I don&#x27;t use them, so I tried them.</li>
            <li>I have used the Gillette Fusion razor since it first came out.  </li>
            <li>Seem to be the same as those sold in stores as they give me just as many shaves.</li>
            <li>By rinsing the gunk off with hot water after shaving, spraying the razor with shower cleaner, then propping it against the wall the durability improves dramatically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>first use they hurt to to use</li>
            <li>Threse ones irritate my skin in the first use.</li>
            <li>First I shave with the Gillette Body blade.</li>
            <li>OKay the fact is the razor industry has conned us all into buying their over priced fancy multiple blade disposable razors.</li>
            <li>Just like in the description, fast delivery, quality!</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>I am hoping this latest pack will last me a minumum of 18 months.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why more people aren&#x27;t demanding the vibrating razors, as regular ones irritate the skin.</li>
            <li>this is the first razor my husband demands.</li>
            <li>Thanks for experience!</li>
            <li>It gives a pretty close shave, but nothing to get ecstatic about.</li>
            <li>I love the Fusion razor, so no complaints there, but I do have to call into question the idea that 12 cartridges will last me a year.</li>
            <li>just think Gillette should lay off advertising the bulk pack as a year&#x27;s worth, since most guys (I know, at least) go through more than one cartridge a month.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Have a styptic pencil at the ready!</li>
            <li>This was the first time I&#x27;ve purchased a Gillette Fusion razor, because the price here in bulk was cheaper than in packs of 4.</li>
            <li>I love the trimming blade on the back.  </li>
            <li>I switched last year to the Gillette Fusion razor (ProGlide) - and love it.</li>
            <li>These razors are exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>I would have to pay lot more at the store for the same number of blades.</li>
            <li>This is exactly like the packs I used to buy at Target</li>
            <li>Thanks Gillette!</li>
            <li>As advertised and must be the real thing!</li>
            <li>Walmart is much higher priced.</li>
            <li>I bought some from my local grocery store just to be sure.</li>
            <li>I bought the batch of 12, it came exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>Expensive but the best</li>
            <li>I have used most of the Gillete series of razors going back to the Sensor.</li>
            <li>Blades are the same as in a store, but price is better.</li>
            <li>I will buy more packages in the future.</li>
            <li>The blades and lubrication strip are pretty trashed after 2-3 days.</li>
            <li>Last longer dont have to worry to buy it many times</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Gillette products for several years now, always switching to the latest product.</li>
            <li>Make sure you take care of the blades so they will last longer.</li>
            <li>These were the best price I could fined for the 12 pack which is still expensive.</li>
            <li>Best razors on the market, but too expensive.</li>
            <li>My first cartridge lasted a week before it needed to be replaced.</li>
            <li>I dumped the razor and all the blades and went back to the gellette fusion, it does a much better job.</li>
            <li>precision trimmer is my favorite part of the product, assisting me in &#x27;squaring&#x27; off the back of my neckline&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>I grew my beard out 2 weeks before trying this out for the first time.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this blade!!</li>
            <li>This is my first time using this razor</li>
            <li>My husband has been using these for years, but this is the first time we purchased them on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>and i will probably go without shaving for a while ;)</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li>When I first started using the Fusion razor</li>
            <li>These razor blades are awesome but so expensive in stores.  </li>
            <li>A great value and a common sense schedule to receive shipments</li>
            <li>Each cartridge had five blades, which at first sounds like it would make the razor too large to use on your face, but I was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was to shave with this razor.</li>
            <li>Get free shipping and no tax on top of that and cut your costs down to about $50.00 per year.  </li>
            <li>its a good razor maybe it will cut down on having to buy them so much.</li>
            <li>Very sharp and works great on sensitive areas.</li>
            <li>For as long as I live in the US, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy razor blades any other way again; this is perfect.</li>
            <li>They fit and they work just fine as expected.</li>
            <li>They give you a very nice close shave but don&#x27;t seem to last very long before they start dulling.</li>
            <li>This didn&#x27;t happen to me and providence called me to other shores, for instance I started a hamburger stand called Hamburglers but was put out of business by a lawsuit from McDonald&#x27;s who own the rights to the character Hamburglar</li>
            <li>sharp and cut nice.</li>
            <li>LOL I&#x27;m serious.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this necessity for shaving sensitive skin is completely cost prohibitive for many and really Gillette, you&#x27;re an American brand of the people...</li>
            <li>harry&#x27;s blades (www.harrys.com) are much cheaper, better and last longer.</li>
            <li>I have bought the 12 pack of these razors three times and even though back in 2011 they were only $30, they are stil a good deal at $42.  </li>
            <li>really like how the top of the blade is left uncovered.</li>
            <li>They are the same as in the store, but more reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I had found these on line and saved a few bucks since as a Prime member I get free shipping and no tax.  </li>
            <li>This product is very good for shaving on daily basis, because it is clean, easy to use, fast to be replaced when it is old and most importantly, it is very easy to see when the blades are no longer sharp (because of the blue / green line righ above it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I use each blade 2-3 times - and for me, am happy to have finally found &amp;#34;my solution&amp;#34; for shaving that eluded me for many years with numerous previous razor systems and blades that I have tried.</li>
            <li>blades in the store are much more expensive not that this is cheap but better</li>
            <li>The first time you use with, you will feel it gently glide against your skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m guessing it will be a long time before I need to buy more.</li>
            <li>Very timely, product was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>These blades work very well at first</li>
            <li>The Gillette Fusion is far superior to any other blade I have ever used.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s really good for small places.</li>
            <li>The price is high, but I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different brands and types and these are still my favorite.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend buying Gillette Fusion razors and refills, especially when they go on sale, many times you can get coupons for them too.</li>
            <li>They also last longer than most other cartridges, giving me more shaves for my dollar over all.</li>
            <li>I have SUPER sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>used Amazons Subscribe and Save for the easy of use since my family uses razors at a regular interval.</li>
            <li>But for the first time since I started shaving almost 20 years ago, I can finally say I&#x27;ve found a comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>Did next expect the easy shaving compared to the Shick 3 razors.</li>
            <li>Helps to save on the large cost of disposable razors.</li>
            <li>These blades are super sharp but easily glide across my face.</li>
            <li>they do much better job and appear sharper than any other Gillette razors, I will keep buying these over any other kind</li>
            <li>4 or 5 shaves max out of the old Sensor where I can use these blades for a good month and a half before I feel the need to replace them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m used to buying an 8-pack for the same price they&#x27;re charging for a 12-pack, and I had to drive out and hunt down the best deal at my local supermarket, target, or drugstore.</li>
            <li>Overall, it works fine.</li>
            <li>However, these really are priced great - at $2 less per blade than our local big-box store.</li>
            <li>These arrived quickly and new (as expected) and I think they are ridiculously priced by Gillette, but this is the best price I&#x27;ve found them for.</li>
            <li>Nice little discount when you buy the 12 count.</li>
            <li>I also began spraying them with Clean Shower as another reviewer suggested, they last much longer!</li>
            <li>Not that this is not the Fusion ProGlide, which are a bit nice, but also a bit more expensive.</li>
            <li>If you like to not have to pay extra to buy overpriced Razor heads every few months this is a great way.</li>
            <li>is appreciated price-wise.</li>
            <li>These are the real Gillette Fusion blades.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>The razor blades were received extremely fast from vendor.</li>
            <li>; I used to really believe that when I was 18.</li>
            <li>I was nervous buying this because I thought that maybe I was not getting the real deal with this.  </li>
            <li>The shave with this blade is very close.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping recied exactl what i wanted.</li>
            <li>Thanks AMAZON for these deals.</li>
            <li>Expected better.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper this way than at the store in town.</li>
            <li>From the very beginning, there were no cuts or irritation at all.</li>
            <li>I really like the shave I get</li>
            <li>The blades are cheaper than in the store but work very well.</li>
            <li>So much cheaper than any where else</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>These razors raze very well.</li>
            <li>The pack was much cheaper than I can find in a store.</li>
            <li>These are the real thing.  </li>
            <li>[He is on medication that stiumlates hair growth, so the beard is abnormally fast growning.]Gillette Fusion Manual does the trick for him.</li>
            <li>Then I use these Proglide blades for an even closer shave without putting too much mileage on them.</li>
            <li>I am really considering switching to a straight razor.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Beware that these razors are IMITATORS of real Fusion blades.  </li>
            <li>They look identical but they are not the real deal.  </li>
            <li>Very convenient and advantageous to book immediately packaging.</li>
            <li>we really need 3 blades?&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I used to pay twice as much for.</li>
            <li>I was using cheap razors that you would have to keep going over the same spot and would pull at the neck line a lot.</li>
            <li>I think it works very well</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t pay much attention to the &amp;#34;green&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>blade contours to the shape of your face, without having to put much pressure.</li>
            <li>The 5 blades give a very close shave, and I didn&#x27;t even have to use any shaving cream.</li>
            <li>received a Gillette fusion Razor and replacement cartridge through Gillette as sample to try, and I have to say I really like it.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than retail outlets.</li>
            <li>What the man wants the man gets.</li>
            <li>These seem to be real Gillette Fusion blades.  </li>
            <li>I thought they might be fakes but they seem to be real ones.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t worry, they are real.  </li>
            <li>we did not have to wait a whole month for him to start using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;booboo&#x27;s girl</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.  </li>
            <li>In fact recently I had the opportunity from BzzAgent to try these blades for free.  </li>
            <li>MUCH cheaper than buying refills at a department store.</li>
            <li>that even when the real thing is in front of them, they won&#x27;t see it.</li>
            <li>Real blades and cheaper than anywhere else.</li>
            <li>I bought theses with the hopes of saving some cash and for my surprise it turned out that these razors are cheap Chinese knock off</li>
            <li>I use them on my entire body except for my face as I use an Electric Razor for that, but my body is smooth when I use these blades.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>An absolute must for those who want a close shave.  </li>
            <li>Price is reasonable, if you are on subscribe &amp; save plan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Can find cheap at your local discount stores.&lt;br</li>
            <li>These blades are identical to the ones I&#x27;ve been paying twice as much for at Walmart or the drug store.</li>
            <li>I also change the blade every 1-2 weeks depending on how much I shave.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I use them very sparingly because to me...</li>
            <li>They cannot cost THIS MUCH to</li>
            <li>I have the handle and for what they cost in the store, it really pays to get them on line.</li>
            <li>and they work very well.</li>
            <li>The blades shipped fast and came as described.</li>
            <li>And the blade on the back is *FANTASTIC* for shaving under my nose.  </li>
            <li>These razor refill cartridges were priced reasonably and get the job done.  </li>
            <li>Buying them in the 12 pack really saves me money.</li>
            <li>I have used the Gillette Fusion blade for years and it gives a smooth and close shave even after multiple uses.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Thanks Gillette for the blades.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this razor!</li>
            <li>That said, the Blades shave really close and smoothly...and they should, for the money Gillette rips us for on their product.  </li>
            <li>You now have real competition.</li>
            <li>but they are not the same as the Pro-Glide blades nor as comfortable on my skin.</li>
            <li>I got these today and hey appear to be the real thing.  </li>
            <li>thanks to bzzagent i am no longer a scruff.</li>
            <li>Gets very close to the skin.  </li>
            <li>Works very well, and is reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>Let get real guy&#x27;s the commercials are true.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Cheaper than local stores and appears to be genuine Gillette product.</li>
            <li>Cheap and should last for a while</li>
            <li>I just really like a close shave.</li>
            <li>The very cheapest way to get razors.  </li>
            <li>They give me a good shave and one blade will provide at least seven days of close shaves and another 7 days of good-enough shaves.</li>
            <li>I never thought a simple razor (powered by a simple AAA battery) could be so efficient and effective.</li>
            <li>Left to their own devices, the Gillette Fusion could end global hunger and bring world peace.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are very comfortable and they hold up well compared to other disposable razor heads I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Always helpful to have a small quantity to fit a new razor, be sure to order some.</li>
            <li>However these razors still feel very sharp and give me a great shave for a long period of time.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t buy them for that reason because every time I start a new blade, it wears off within the first shave.</li>
            <li>Overall, this razor left my face clean and smooth without razor burn or bumps.</li>
            <li>but I really feel like I got more use out of this one compared to other brands.</li>
            <li>they cost more then some other blades but work very well for me &amp;</li>
            <li>But, I&#x27;ve seen better pricing around for other razors.</li>
            <li>Unlike all other razors I&#x27;ve used, you never have access to the top of the blade.</li>
            <li>As a retired Marine I have kept myself closely shaved for pretty much all my adult life.</li>
            <li>I was expecting it to give extra clean shave, but it didn&#x27;t do it.</li>
            <li>The blades are amazing quality and last a really long time.  </li>
            <li>I think these are generally the most overpriced product I use on a regular basis.  </li>
            <li>It is not worth the bother when Gillette makes such a good product.</li>
            <li>The outer box is plain white, but inside is some kind of special Gillette packaging, and what I received looked exactly like the pictures here on Amazon, complete with Gillette logos, colors, and everything.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Having said that, they do work great and last a long time as long as you rinse them off really well after use.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>12 count Gillette Fusion Manual Cartridges will keep your face fuzz free for a long time.</li>
            <li>This purchase should last me a full year since I don&#x27;t shave every day.</li>
            <li>Better shave than the average womans razor.</li>
            <li>They are very expensive and the advertisements tout what a wonderful shave you will get</li>
            <li>I am usually a mach 3 kind of guy</li>
            <li>They last a long time for me, usually a month or longer, and continue to provide an excellent shave.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true that I have a coarse beard, but the cost on these equates to around $200.00 per year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>However, the price of the blades is much higher than my old blades.  </li>
            <li>I already love the Gillette brand and knew they wouldn&#x27;t let me down.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is like getting a $50 computer printer and then finding out that new ink costs $75 a pop!</li>
            <li>They work very well in my new power swivel razor, even though I accidentally bought the non-power blades.</li>
            <li>There really isn&#x27;t much like shaving your face with a brand new razor.</li>
            <li>and maybe you&#x27;ll even sell more and have fewer on the black market</li>
            <li>I often go more than a month with the same blade, with no noticeable extra effort needed on head or face.</li>
            <li>I have been to the local store many times and they have you take a card from the shaving area to the cashier (instead of the actual razors).</li>
            <li>they keep coming out with newer blades that are just more and more expensive.  </li>
            <li>and they don&#x27;t have the same issue--the can go many weeks to months on the same blades.</li>
            <li>The problem is the price; they are getting more expensive every time I need to buy more.</li>
            <li>The leave a close shave and last considerably longer than the cheap ones</li>
            <li>Wife and husband both use these both older with thinning skin.</li>
            <li>I figured I would try these razors because Amazon.com has a great return policy if it turned out that these were fake, but I see no indication at all that these are not the real thing.</li>
            <li>I love them both and alternate between them on a monthly basis for the same \\&quot;feel\\</li>
            <li>Every year they seem to get more and more expensive...</li>
            <li>Outstanding price, I order enough for the year for extra savings.</li>
            <li>I change my blades every five to six months, because I find that is how long they last with daily use at optimum performance.</li>
            <li>The ridiculously high price....</li>
            <li>I highly recommend buying this product from amazon.</li>
            <li>I test the disposable blades we keep around for travel bags and guests, these are what those get compared with, and they set a high bar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>The price everywhere is too high in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s a few options, but you can pick them up very cheap at any store:&lt;br /&gt;+</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone needing this razor.</li>
            <li>I always get a great shave with the Gillette Fusion and had been buying these razor cartridges from a local store up until last week when I noticed I could get them online for a lot less.</li>
            <li>Seems fine and as expected.</li>
            <li>Well, after a couple of months using them i can say that the blades are super sharp, leaving my face feel absolutely smooth, while never cutting me, unlike some other blades.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had as many as 50 shaves from one blade or as little as 30 shaves</li>
            <li>Gillette Fusion Manual Razor Blade Refills are the only product available that comfortably removes the heavy beard growth of my son.  </li>
            <li>Great Item, Too expensive but</li>
            <li>These blades really help prevent razor burn and don&#x27;t cut me as much as my old razor did.</li>
            <li>Hubby says they are expensive but work great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never cut my head - only my fingers and rarely, face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Ordered about a month ago and still using only the first one out of whole box - 12 count.</li>
            <li>Far better than the generic knock-offs, but these are definitely pricey!</li>
            <li>, I personally do not find the difference worth the cost.</li>
            <li>The cartridges are certainly more expensive than buying disposable razors, but they provide a much better shave by far.</li>
            <li>economical to purchase versus the drug store, Wal-Mart etc.. delivered to my house on a regular schedule.</li>
            <li>I joined the subscription service for Gillette Fusion Manual Cartridges, the cartridges are legit and through the Amazon subscription service your able to save a few dollars monthly on your purchase of the cartridges.</li>
            <li>They are very expensive, but rather than getting cuts or nicks, they are worth the price and do a great job without irritation.  </li>
            <li>These blades are long lasting (man&#x27;s face), then are demoted for another months or more (ladies legs).</li>
            <li>and he has a heavy beard and requires a lot more time shaving burns up the blades</li>
            <li>I used the Gillette Fusion during my normal shaving over the course of 2 weeks</li>
            <li>They key to getting the most use out of the blades is to rinse the water off with alcohol after use, and then let the blades air dry.</li>
            <li>Make sure you dry the blade after use to make it last longer.</li>
            <li>I went through several brands trying to find the right one</li>
            <li>only and very minor comment is that the trimmer blade on the backside could be slightly smaller which would make it really great for getting at those tough to reach / more precision areas.</li>
            <li>Once you open the box the holder for the fusion manual includes a very large advertisement for the fusion proglide.  </li>
            <li>so I used to have trouble getting a clean shave on the first try.</li>
            <li>But, it&#x27;s a comfortable shave while it&#x27;s sharp.</li>
            <li>Comfortable, sharp get the job done.</li>
            <li>These new blades do not shave the way the ealier ones did.</li>
            <li>i am new to manual shaving, having switched from electric shaving about a year ago.  </li>
            <li>It may be &amp;quot;out-of-the-box&amp;quot; but these replacement blades are brand new.</li>
            <li>It maybe time for a new blade.</li>
            <li>I just haven&#x27;t had time to find a new razor and razor blades, or I would have switched.</li>
            <li>I thought maybe it was me, but I used a brand new Fusion razor that I got through the mail</li>
            <li>The cartridges seemed brand new.</li>
            <li>learn a new language site</li>
            <li>They arrived new and undamaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;These were new and delivered on time if not a bit sooner.</li>
            <li>This is my new razor/blades.</li>
            <li>It itches, and for days I have to live with the irritation, but these blades have literally changed everything around for me.</li>
            <li>You forget how well they shave when new.</li>
            <li>It is ok but it feels like blades are getting dull to fast , and for that price they shouldn&#x27;t</li>
            <li>While it&#x27;s super sharp, it&#x27;s also quite gentle, in case anybody was thinking about &#x27;manscaping&#x27; with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>With 5 blades I don&#x27;t have to shave the same spot on my face multiple times, the first stroke gets it done right.  </li>
            <li>All that said, these blades give a close, comfortable shave and last for multiple shaves.  </li>
            <li>They shave me smoothly and closely and they last for weeks of daily shaving before they start to &#x27;grab&#x27; my beard.  </li>
            <li>It might cost more, but at least I know they are real.</li>
            <li>Delivery took just a few days, much shorter than promised, plus shipping was free.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Amazon for frustration free (and less) packaging!</li>
            <li>Thanks to Amazon for frustration free (and less) packaging!</li>
            <li>They are effective at cutting the hair, and they seem to last a good long time.  </li>
            <li>so he replaced the first blade with a 2nd new blade.</li>
            <li>They looked to be brand new and owed as such upon first time use.</li>
            <li>Scrapes large amounts of thick hair effectively without letting enough blood to send me to the ER.</li>
            <li>The blades are long lasting, don&#x27;t rust, and are easy to change.</li>
            <li>Helped trim around my mustache perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;The cartridges last a really long time and are easy to replace.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s still something to be aware of - if you screw up with these blades, especially if you&#x27;re using them for headshaving, your mistake will not be painlessly forgiven.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>With my sensitive skin, these 5 bladed things are a must!</li>
            <li>I generally get about 15-20 shaves out of one blade (but then again I don&#x27;t have a very dense beard)..</li>
            <li>thing I notice is that I have cut myself more often with these than I have before with the stock blades, not sure the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These seem like the same exact blades I have bought in the store.</li>
            <li>I could start feeling the use on that blade after the first or second shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I personally think the 5 closely packed blades make it more difficult to rinse and fill up faster requiring more rinsing.</li>
            <li>At first I thought perhaps my facial hair had gotten coarser or something caused the faster dulling</li>
            <li>I shredded my face about the 3rd or 4th use of the first blade.</li>
            <li>Look Sharp, Feel Sharp Gillette is a great shave just like the old 1950s commercial that I saw on tv when I was young.</li>
            <li>but these just seem to be engineered in a different way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s worth it to spend a little more and get razors that work properly.</li>
            <li>These are more expensive than most, but they last longer than your typical cheap razor.  </li>
            <li>I would rather pay a high price for the handle and a lower price for the refills, ESPECIALLY in these economic times!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s not much to say really, they worked fine and lasted a long time.</li>
            <li>,my search these many years,( I am 60), has finally come to fruition with a better quality, better shave, and reasonable cost compared to the outrageous prices that Gillette gets for their product.  </li>
            <li>It was able to handle a thick beard with ease and get closer than my regular razor on just the first shave.</li>
            <li>These cost less than getting 6 from my local stores so why not get more for your money?  </li>
            <li>/&gt;These blades will cut your face and only last about a week - if you are lucky.</li>
            <li>Tried a different brand recently--a subscription of Harry&#x27;s.  Looked nice and was definitely cheaper to buy, but didn&#x27;t come close to the quality and sharpness of the Gillette Fusion blades and didn&#x27;t last nearly as long.  </li>
            <li>but, you know, I went to a barber in Managua, Nicaragua and had a shave with a straight razor, which is single blade, and that shave lasted for two whole days.  </li>
            <li>I have an Average Density and Medium Beard Texture, so in my First Experience I really wanted to Test this NEW Blade.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Finally, unlike the packaging that Fusion blades come from big box/club stores in: these arrive in a simple and easy to open container:</li>
            <li>This is only a review of the refills, not a of the Fusion razor system.&lt;br /&gt;Buying refills in quantity is nice, besides the cost savings, because of less plastic packaging found in local retail stores.&lt;br /&gt;Actually, there is no outer plastic packaging when purchased like this</li>
            <li>While this is a big change compared to dual blade razors, they seem to dull fairly quickly, and the moisturizing strip doesn&#x27;t seem to last more than 3-4 days for me.  </li>
            <li>I felt these were not original gillete, the blades when shaving did not have the smooth shave.</li>
            <li>If you like the Gillette brand, spend a little more and buy them from your local store.  </li>
            <li>My favorite razor blades, but they seem to get dull faster than before.  </li>
            <li>To make them last VERY long, just take your thumb and give the blades a downward wipe or two to clean them off after shaving and rinsing them.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re expensive, but they last a while and give a great shave.</li>
            <li>I find that I can use one blade for three weeks, but clearly at that time, they need to be replaced.</li>
            <li>these razors are clearly imitations of the real ones,the wear out almost instantly and no matter how careul you are, you will cut your face and have ingrown hair</li>
            <li>and it all gets more confusing than helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>We know you&#x27;re only charging so much because you can.  </li>
            <li>Cheapest price I have found so far...</li>
            <li>I used to use double-edged blades and frequently had razor burn, cuts, scrapes, etc.</li>
            <li>WOW  </li>
            <li>The only - and real problem - with them?  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ve just stuck with it so far.</li>
            <li>After product arrived, I was pleasantly surprised that these blades came directly from the manufacturer.</li>
            <li>There seem to be a lot of concerns that these may be factory seconds or knock-offs -- I found 8-packs direct from Gillette on their shop.gillette.com website for about $3/each, guaranteed to be factory originals.  </li>
            <li>These are the same refills on retail packaging, but at a much lower price.</li>
            <li>These are definitely not the same blades as I normally buy - after the first two shaves they tear your face up - sub-standard for the Gillette name to be associated.</li>
            <li>My 18 year old loves the Gillette Fusion Razors.</li>
            <li>He has sensitive skin and these blades don&#x27;t irritate him like others.</li>
            <li>To save as much money as possible I now dab the razon on a bathroom towel after each use and it seems to extend the life of each razor by about a month.  </li>
            <li>Maybe I am just getting old.</li>
            <li>I feel like I should just buy a whole razor next time instead of the razor refills.</li>
            <li>I use to buy at my local drug store but was paying way too much.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s also very helpful that the lubrication strip will turn to white</li>
            <li>I am at about 10-12 shaves so far</li>
            <li>and it seems like I can get at least 3-5 more.</li>
            <li>They are much cheaper than what you can find them for at the local store.  </li>
            <li>This item was purchased and fulfilled by Amazon directly.  </li>
            <li>Overall, since the official Gillette blades last for a month, we are all better off financially bying the official ones in a standard shop.</li>
            <li>your going to need razors for the rest of your adult life</li>
            <li>I have a sensitive face and these razors help reduce the bumps from ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money.  </li>
            <li>I am 50 years old and had used Gillette Trac II forever, until these came along.</li>
            <li>It is very convenient to get it almost next day to your door</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not &amp;#34;like new&amp;#34;, but it definitely takes the scratchy edge off the shave and makes it reasonable.  </li>
            <li>Let my skin baby soft.</li>
            <li>The five blades feel like they glide over my sensitive skin and did not leave razor burn or bumps.</li>
            <li>I also purchased directly from Amazon and didn&#x27;t have any problems of having any knock offs.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have tried the newer Proglide Fusion blades, but personally don&#x27;t think they are worth the extra money.</li>
            <li>These razor blades claim that &amp;#34;Just one 12-count blade refill can give you a full year of shaves (based on average days of use per refill)&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I have tried the newer Proglide Fusion blades, but personally don&#x27;t think they are worth the extra money.</li>
            <li>Expensive but good.  </li>
            <li>Expensive, but they&#x27;re good.</li>
            <li>I like the case it comes in, makes it easy to keep up with all of the blades and takes up very little space.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally write a negative review unless I feel strongly about letting people know they should avoid the product at all cost, and this falls under that category.</li>
            <li>The strip doesn&#x27;t last long, but it&#x27;s still a super razor.</li>
            <li>long, Gillette, I&#x27;m no longer paying your extraordinary prices, which is why I only rate you at three stars.  </li>
            <li>I know I can&#x27;t go back to buying other cheap razors I used to buy.</li>
            <li>Sharp, has the 1 blade to trim and the 5 blades to give a close shave (heck i sound like their commercial).</li>
            <li>They wear out much faster than I expected and they don&#x27;t give me the close shave I want, but they sell at a decent price.  </li>
            <li>: I found that storing my razor vertically with the blades down has been a tremendous help in extending the life of my blades.  </li>
            <li>The lubrication strip will be nearly gone after your first use and definitely gone by your second shave.  </li>
            <li>It will flay the skin along several lines, and it can be pretty deep, and it will bleed a lot.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t feel any different than the much higher priced blades that I buy in the big box stores.</li>
            <li>I can usually get at least a dozen great shaves from one blade.  </li>
            <li>Please be aware that these blades are not official Gillette blades and that they will only last for one week each before they are blunt.</li>
            <li>To avoid it, I only use these high quality blades.  </li>
            <li>This was my last purchase of these high priced blades.</li>
            <li>you have thoughts of changing your shave style I highly recommend watching the enormous amount of videos on You</li>
            <li>The blades offer a smooth, close shave with very little pull.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not so much the pack of razor blades that perk me up as much as the whole package of getting them for a decent price considering they are so expensive and knowing it will work for me for a whole year.</li>
            <li>I am a woman and this is a mans razor , but it is the only razor I have found that leaves Everthing smooth including all the odd angled places.</li>
            <li>These blades are very expensive but work great.  </li>
            <li>and they actually last longer than the normal 2 blade cartridges.</li>
            <li>Not much to say, they r the real thing!</li>
            <li>It does pay to be particularly careful with the first couple of shaves to avoid nicking yourself while the blade is at its sharpest.</li>
            <li>tried several of these from a 24 count purchase and they all feel like just before I toss them for a new one, like they have been used??</li>
            <li>I finally decided it was time to get a new set of razors.  </li>
            <li>These are so expensive, but with Amazon we get an amazing deal and since the blade doesn&#x27;t require as frequent changes and the shave lasts longer</li>
            <li>The only real downside to it that I can see is that I think they could last longer.  </li>
            <li>I do wish that the moisturizing strips, and razor as a whole would last just a big longer.  </li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t get into tight places, like under the nose, and cut myself more than with any other razor.</li>
            <li>did not like-blades were not sharp</li>
            <li>no other co makes comparable razors.</li>
            <li>It might take extra work, but the blade rinses easily and a little extra time is all that&#x27;s needed.&lt;br</li>
            <li>IT APPEARS GENUINE GILLETTE BLADES ARE BLACK AND GREY</li>
            <li>Typically I&#x27;m skeptical of \\&quot;premium\\&quot; brand names, but I&#x27;ve used mach 3, a few generic razors, and earlier Gillette models, and I have to admit the Gillette Fusion cartridges are the best.</li>
            <li>They last a long time if you clean them and dry them after each use!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other brands in the past and Gillette is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>Overall, provides clean shave with few to no nicks.</li>
            <li>I have been shaving with these for as long as they have been out and never run into this problem with what I buy at the drug store (except the price is stupidly high).</li>
            <li>) they blades &amp;#34;out of the box&amp;#34; are fantastic, but on my beard they get dull within days.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing how expensive razors have become.</li>
            <li>they really dot last long.</li>
            <li>I am 63 Years Old Male and have been Shaving since I was Sixteen Years Old.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll admit that this is the only type I&#x27;ve used so far</li>
            <li>which I consider the bane of being a guy but look forward to getting done for the sake of looking professional, pleasing the lady, and not having a scraggly beard or whiskers), I&#x27;ve always wanted to shave as close as possible and not cut myself while shaving.</li>
            <li>I have been using them for years with Gillette Sensitive Skin Shaving Cream as I shave my entire body, (legs, arms, underarms, butt, and these blades</li>
            <li>barely give me a weeks shave.  </li>
            <li>No razor burn, and barely even a scrape.</li>
            <li>I used to dread shaving because my skin was so sensitive, by the next day</li>
            <li>It was a big improvement from my old razor.  </li>
            <li>I went back to my old Mach III for a while to save some money and things I have noticed</li>
            <li>Sad, because I really liked the idea of saving by bulk buying.</li>
            <li>They are also kind of expensive per each blade.</li>
            <li>I would have to trim my beard down with clippers first and then shave.</li>
            <li>The trick to long lasting razors is to dry the as quickly and as often as possible.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as close as they may advertise and takes a few strokes to get things right.  </li>
            <li>I also wished they held up a little better for a little longer.  </li>
            <li>Hard to get too excited about razor blades, but I like these.</li>
            <li>Decent Quality and last a long time for the price you pay.</li>
            <li>Very affordable compare to other places</li>
            <li>There are other blades out thier that dont cost as much and dont force you to buy a handle for each and every blade.</li>
            <li>Having tried 1-5 blades, 5 blades definitely makes a difference especially if you have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>If you need a clean shave for thick stubble, this should work for you.</li>
            <li>Decent price, but not much below retail</li>
            <li>Came in a nice cardboard case so it wasn&#x27;t difficult to open which was helpful.  </li>
            <li>Again, some blades were good others I could feel cutting me on the same shave.</li>
            <li>They last a long time (3-4 weeks of daily shaving for each blade) and stay super sharp.  </li>
            <li>Not sharp enough.</li>
            <li>The only major problem is that they are a bit pricey.  </li>
            <li>Arrived exactly as expected, high quality.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and thick hair and these work GREAT but are so expensive locally.</li>
            <li>Slightly disappointed because I thought these were proglide, but still a great deal.  </li>
            <li>He already had the razor but generally purchased smaller packs of blades.</li>
            <li>My recommendation is to buy an old fashioned double edge razor and experiment with double edged blades from various makers until you find one that you like.</li>
            <li>I wish I would have read the reviews before I ordered these blades, these are definitely sub-standard blades, not sure why, they look genuine and I trust that Amazon sells only genuine items like this, they are very dull and hurt to shave, definitely can&#x27;t use these, guess I will just pay the store price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shave down and with gentle strokes</li>
            <li>As a matter fact I really can&#x27;t tell you how long they last, is long enough that when I start noticing it pulling</li>
            <li>Clean them properly and they will last at least three times as song.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re fantastic, and I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s because of the lubrication strip, or just the blades, but when I use these, I have absolutely no irritation on my neck.</li>
            <li>While Costco has priced their product a few dollars more, my past experience shows me</li>
            <li>Most blades that get thrown out are not dull, they are just dirty.  </li>
            <li>used another Gillette product (Excel blades) for nearly 20 years before their availability became limited.</li>
            <li>(There is a single razor on the back of the cartridge for close quarter trimming or to create clean edges and small areas.)</li>
            <li>I see P&amp;G now responding to negative posts so going to give these one more shot since the price is $5 to $10 less than in stores.  </li>
            <li>Not sure there&#x27;s really a difference between the Fusion and other Gilette razors really.</li>
            <li>You can gussy them up with all the high tech whohas and futuristic colors and names but in the dark they all shave the same.</li>
            <li>Just your average everyday razor, nothing special or something to write home about.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and each razor lasts for a fair amount of time, so it&#x27;s bad</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I haven&#x27;t found a better blade out there to shave with.</li>
            <li> we love these razors</li>
            <li> All I can suggest is find a better blade and try using a Schick Titanium blade.</li>
            <li> I am able to get three uses out of each one.  </li>
            <li> Of course it works great but very costly.</li>
            <li> I have always enjoyed this line of razors, and being able to buy in bulk like</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad my wife convinced me to use these Gillette Fusion blades.</li>
            <li> I used the Gillette Mach III for many years and when Canary Toopard passed (my pet gorilla)</li>
            <li> I decided to celebrate (he came to control and torture me for many years at the end) by upgrading to the Fusion.</li>
            <li> Really love the quality of this razors.</li>
            <li> most versatile manual cartridge.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m glad I decided to purchase the 12-count  package thru Amazon.  </li>
            <li> of all of the types of razors I have used for many years, there is no comparison to the Gillette Fusion.  </li>
            <li> Love the razors.. Been using them for three years now.</li>
            <li> This is simply the best technology razor there is out there</li>
            <li> Interesting packaging.</li>
            <li> but I guess that is OK.</li>
            <li> I have been using them for many years.</li>
            <li> The ProGlides just sting more.</li>
            <li> These blades are my husband&#x27;s favorite for shaving.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;These razors work, but they could be better.  </li>
            <li> What&#x27;s more...</li>
            <li> Better price per blade than purchased separately or in a store.</li>
            <li> I find them better than the 3 blade Gilette cartridges.</li>
            <li> Love these razor heads.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure.  </li>
            <li> Enjoy your close shave everyone!</li>
            <li> but these blades sure are not one of them.&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li> you have the money and are looking for a better shave, get this product.</li>
            <li> I HOPE MORE THAN YEAR.&lt;br /&gt;THANLS</li>
            <li> Best price on Fusion blades, the only ones my husband uses, that I could find.</li>
            <li> Better than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> Many reviewers had already pointed this out</li>
            <li> love the price compared to the store.</li>
            <li> Better than buying in the store.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Update 4/1/14 - Latest order was much better than before.  </li>
            <li> I order when I need more, and this is cheaper than buying retail.</li>
            <li> Just what I love...</li>
            <li> but they want you to use it more often to spend more money.</li>
            <li> I get much better value.</li>
            <li> I am quite pleased with this item.</li>
            <li> Thought there were more in the package.</li>
            <li> I love my Gillette Fusion vibrating razor.</li>
            <li> I love the Gillette Fusion Razor and the refills I have no complaints about either product</li>
            <li> And that&#x27;s ok, because buying the 12-pack is cheaper (per cartridge) than the 4.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I love Gillette razors, but i&#x27;ll use the one i used before.</li>
            <li> I thoroughly enjoyed my experience with the Gillette Fusion Razor.</li>
            <li> I think I will be purchasing more cartridges for this razor.</li>
            <li> I can get more than a month of shaves out...</li>
            <li> Read more</li>
            <li> now i can buy more  </li>

            <li> I have been extremely pleased with the switch.</li>
            <li> Thanks Gillette for allowing me to test your great product free of charge!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I love these blades and would recommend them to anyone.</li>
            <li> Sometimes more is better.</li>
            <li> started using this product in 2009 and since then, I never stopped and I just intent to do it when I find a better option for shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> delivery process was ok, with no surprises from the seller.</li>
            <li> Subscription deal is awesome for the razors, I like being able to manage my next orders.</li>
            <li> The best simple razor ever made.</li>
            <li> Will buy again for sure.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be ordering more.</li>
            <li> I have switched mostly to electric these days</li>
            <li> Love gillette razors..</li>
            <li> And it gets better....</li>
            <li> Love this razor and getting blades is always cheaper when you get them in multi-packs of 8 or 12.</li>
            <li> The more in the pack, the cheaper they are.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different brands and found that Gillette is the best.</li>
            <li> My favorite manual shaver for once a week.</li>
            <li> the ad on tv said it would cost me 52.00 a year at the price u sell the blades it going to cost me alot more then that</li>
            <li> Much more cost efficient than buying a pack of 4 or 8 retail.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Love them.</li>
            <li> So glad I bought this on a refill cycle.</li>
            <li> Outstanding</li>
            <li> Price is ok.</li>
            <li> love Gillette product line, Gillette Fusion is my favorite.</li>
            <li> Excellent price, especially when you set it up through the subscribe and save program and automatic delivery system!</li>
            <li> These Gillette Fusion Manual Men&#x27;s Razor Blade Refills are a sure buy for me again as I have been using them for years</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for more than 2 years</li>
            <li> For years I have been saying these cartridges are a total rip off, but they are the best!!!</li>
            <li> I am sure there are premium competitors that might do the trick, but Gillette is never standing still.  </li>
            <li> 99 percent of all the stuff i order from i love it works out for both of use .</li>
            <li> I have purchased these multiple times on amazon since it has the best deal.</li>
            <li> Much better.  </li>
            <li> I threw them away and brought these - and it is so much better.  </li>
            <li> These have been my razor blades of choice for many years.  </li>
            <li> The added time of use more the outweighs the increase in cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Tried to save more money by switching to cheaper blades/razors, and ended up with cuts on my face and head (I shave that too).  </li>
            <li> ...the only way to buy fusion blades - great price!</li>
            <li> these are a fantastic price!</li>
            <li> I love these blades, I&#x27;m a girl</li>
            <li> guys check out YOUTUBE on better shave and save life of blades.</li>
            <li> Helps to get these blades at a better price.</li>
            <li> Everyone seems to be going to the &amp;#34;safety razor&amp;#34; shaves these days, but I haven&#x27;t been able to bring myself to move away from the Fusion.  </li>
            <li> Having 12 means I don&#x27;t have to think about getting more any time soon.</li>
            <li> Will order more soon,</li>
            <li> Not that much better than a 2,3, or 4 bladed razor</li>
            <li> Way better than the Mach 3</li>
            <li> Much better than the 2 blade disposable I have been using.</li>
            <li> Have had this razor for many years, and I love it.  </li>
            <li> Make sure not to get the electric if you dont need.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize until now I had been using a slightly better line of Gillette Fusion blades.  </li>
            <li> I can each cartridge for a month or more.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t you love paying $4 per cartridge?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am so glad I got to try this product</li>
            <li> and now people have an option for a better product.  </li>
            <li> So much better pricing in Amazon than in store purchase.</li>
            <li> Definitely the best brand razor blades on the market.</li>
            <li> And yes it is more</li>
            <li> Such a great product!</li>
            <li> My husband likes these blades and I&#x27;ll order more.</li>
            <li> I love these blades and boy</li>
            <li> Better price than I could find anywhere.</li>
            <li> My husband loves his Gillette Fusion Razor and love the cartridges as well, he doesn&#x27;t tend to throw the blade away after the strip fades because he feels there is life to the blade.</li>
            <li> fit in my hand nice.</li>
            <li> So much more convenient than having to shop when I run out.</li>
            <li> These are great blades they just cost way to much.  </li>
            <li> but they still cost more than I care to pay.  </li>
            <li> I could not be more pleased.  </li>
            <li> Love the razor and the blades.....</li>
            <li> Others were OK.  </li>
            <li> Still my favorite razors.</li>
            <li> I end up with more ingrowns that way as well.</li>
            <li> They are better -</li>
            <li> Love every thing about it.</li>
            <li> Honestly, the original Fusion blades are better then the newer ProGlides, which are interchangeable on any Fusion handle.</li>
            <li> Except for the high price, they are very good and smooth shaving.</li>
            <li> The same great razors at an exceptional price.</li>
            <li> They give a nice clean shave.</li>
            <li> Nice, clean shaven legs.</li>
            <li> Great shave at a high price.  </li>
            <li> We keep buying them though because they are great, which keeps the price high</li>
            <li> SAY HOW LONG AND ONE OF THE DAY I FOUND BEST PRICE</li>
            <li> The DSC blades were good on the first use but always felt like they were pulling hair.</li>
            <li> If you are willing to pay the price, these blades do a good job.</li>
            <li> I think it was a pretty good value.</li>
            <li> best thing I bought in a long time!</li>
            <li> These blades came in brand new packaging, and looked great upon arrival.  </li>
            <li> ive used it a few times now, just to keep her happy, and its worked great.</li>
            <li> love it.&lt;br /&gt;Comfortable and easy to use,&lt;br</li>
            <li> Yet, if you can make a razor 12 pack last a year, and they&#x27;re so cheap on Amazon, why not buy the best?</li>
            <li> I had been using the sensor excel for the last 15 years, then Gillette sent me this for free in the mail and it works great!</li>
            <li> 2nd time ordering and will order again, great product at a nice savings.</li>
            <li> Great, nice and simple and protective.&lt;br /&gt;Would buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> Love em fast delivery good price.</li>
            <li> Great price on great blades and the eco-box shipping works just fine holding the extra blade cartridges until you need to swap in a fresh blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE the shave I get with the Fusion blades, and it works on the powered and unpowered handle just fine.</li>
            <li> I think they&#x27;re the best, but they&#x27;re not THAT much better than other razors.</li>
            <li> Great deal, good price, beats every other razor (hands-down) for my husband.</li>
            <li> These ones do not glide smoothly, I need to pull the razor and it makes scraping sound!</li>
            <li> This eliminates razor burn for me and results in a more comfortable shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> love his smooth face.&lt;br /&gt;Love.</li>
            <li> These are most definitely genuine Gillette Fusion blades.  </li>
            <li> I am a man and love a smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> Closest most comfortable shave</li>
            <li> These are good refills my husband thought that it was very convenient to use and they arrived within days</li>
            <li> Always a nice close shave an no cuts, even on a fresh blade</li>
            <li> Very convenient and $$$ was good</li>
            <li> Pay more and get the real blades and leave these alone!!!</li>
            <li> like how the blade assembly follows my face and provides a good shave by keeping the blades at the right angle and in full contact with my skin.  </li>
            <li> Super awesome price for the same thing you buy at the store.</li>
            <li> like the product, they are in handy came at right price</li>
            <li> It looks nice and is priced right.</li>
            <li> It does a great job on facial hair and is very comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> Awesome and as expected!</li>
            <li> so I went ahead and ordered (since I knew I could return easily with Amazon).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to replace these blade refills, and their package make it convenient for storing them.</li>
            <li> The refills are easy to use.</li>
            <li> The refills come out of the package easily and effortlessly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jeff614</li>
            <li> Easy to take out of the cartridge, easy to recognize when to re-place the blade.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s easy to use and customize.  </li>
            <li> I get 6 weeks to two months from each blade, easily.</li>
            <li> Easy to replace heads on fusion products.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I loved the individual product, and the subscription feature is just as amazing.</li>
            <li> These blades provide me with 5-8 good shaves before they need to be replaced...much better than the lifespan of my old safety razors.</li>
            <li> It is so easy to switch cartridges.</li>
            <li> -- shave is much better and closer, blades last longer, skin looks great after shaving.  </li>
            <li> Also, the easy packaging is helpful as well.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with it and the Razor works significantly better than many other cheaper razors out there.</li>
            <li> Even with a new blade you can feel the difference and after you have shaved, take a good look at your face and you will see and feel the pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stay</li>
            <li> Love them and wouldn&#x27;t trade them for a different kind!</li>
            <li> Totally fine product.</li>
            <li> what can I say, they work fine.</li>
            <li> Seem to work fine.</li>
            <li> These are fine razors but they&#x27;re so overpriced.</li>
            <li> These are a great shave, as long as you are okay with taking out a mortgage on your house to afford these refills.</li>
            <li> When I got the blades the packaging was fine.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> works fine as the shaver itself.</li>
            <li> Super deal!</li>
            <li> These glide easily over the skin and are easy to clean as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very comfortable shave and rarely a nick.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s well established that drying the blades will HUGELY extend the life of the cartridge.</li>
            <li> - the blade itself is a rare product that works maybe better than advertised.</li>
            <li> Great quality, these are the only blades my husband will use.</li>
            <li> No cuts, smooth shaving</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;- 5 blades makes the process smooth</li>
            <li> Delivered on the same day and in great shape.</li>
            <li> Something was off--they didn&#x27;t feel as smooth as raisers from the store...</li>
            <li> Always smooth results..and</li>
            <li> i think these blades may be genuine, but I&#x27;m guessing they are genuine for regions where Gillette sells lower-grade blades.</li>
            <li> However, the amazon price is great (especially with subscribe &amp; save).</li>
            <li> (yeah, those free mail offerings with a shaver for Gillette got me)</li>
            <li> Great deal compared to what you find in your standard grocery/drug stores.  </li>
            <li> I refuse to pay prices at the supermarket and drug stores or go through all the madness of getting it cheap at Costco.</li>
            <li> This item is currently available from Costco</li>
            <li> shave is close, comfortable and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I believe them to be genuine.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s genuine or not.</li>
            <li> My husband shaves his head a few times per week and these are the best blades he has found.  </li>
            <li> Genuine Gillette blades.....</li>
            <li> I received the Gillette Fusion razor for free from Gillette and catridge to review and will use again.</li>
            <li> smooth shave</li>
            <li> have a light beard</li>
            <li> All these blades, fit for both facescaping and</li>
            <li> Gillette provided me this product for free for the purpose of trying and reviewing.</li>
            <li> I received this product for free as a bzzagent.</li>
            <li> But overall this is a great razor.</li>
            <li> I picked this up at the store, because i wanted to have more than a month&#x27;s worth of razors for once.</li>
            <li> As a result, a blade is comfortable on my face for a week, then I need to change it out.</li>
            <li> I received the razor for free to try out via Gillette.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin so smooth and the lotion strip makes my skin feel moisturized.</li>
            <li> One pull of the razor across my face makes the skin unbelievably smooth.</li>
            <li> I received this in the mail for free to test and review from Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Never again will I be suckered into buying cheap blades.  </li>
            <li> These might cost more, but well worth it.  </li>
            <li> I received the Gillette fusion blades as a free sample.</li>
            <li> Thank you to Gilette for giving me the Gilette Fusion and cartridge refill free of charge for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using it.</li>
            <li> Smooth.</li>
            <li> Smooth, no cuts, no scrapes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m switching to the Shick Hydro, as I got a free sample, and the blade there has lasted two, going on three weeks.  </li>
            <li> I wish these were available for subscription</li>
            <li> These cartridges fit both Gillette Fusion and Gillette Fusion Power razors.</li>
            <li> The Gillette fusion manual men does not make me have rushes, because it is smooth on edge.</li>
            <li> Same great blades.</li>
            <li> get the closest smooth shave without nicks and cuts.  </li>
            <li> I also question whether or not these are genuine Gillette Fusion blades.</li>
            <li> My shave is comfortable &amp; close.</li>
            <li> Lives up to the advertisement one refill lasts me up to a month of comfortable close shaves.</li>
            <li> These Gillette blades aren&#x27;t &#x27;cheap&#x27; but they have reliable quality and their longevity makes them a cost-effective choice for customers.</li>
            <li> These razors work well and smooth.  </li>
            <li> No cuts and it is a comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li> However, I now use a double-edged safety razor and really enjoy the ritual of it all.</li>
            <li> yes I seem to be great for the priceI have only use one</li>
            <li> Smoother than rubbing a stick of unsalted butter on your face.</li>
            <li> I have bought a set after I received my free sample from Gillette.</li>
            <li> I received two Fusion razor cartridges from Gillette to try for free.</li>
            <li> is so smooth</li>
            <li> Use Them Daily, Great products</li>
            <li> Great price and each of these blades last me a month.  </li>
            <li> I used cheap disposable razors for years</li>
            <li> He loves the way the blades leave his skin, smooth and not irriated at all.  </li>
            <li> overall the razor was great.</li>
            <li> i really enjoy my razor.</li>
            <li> They are genuine Gillette blades.</li>
            <li> Close, comfortable shave on what ever skin you use them on.</li>
            <li> However, they work great and they seem to last about four or five shaves, for me.  </li>
            <li> Smooth shave, and</li>
            <li> Seems the same great blade...</li>
            <li> Purchased these with the subscribe and save and looks like a good deal so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried cheaper razors/disposables and most of them are only good for one shave.</li>
            <li> so far so good.</li>
            <li> Good design-I was surprised.</li>
            <li> These are probably marketed overseas at a lower cost, which is fine if that&#x27;s what you are use to, but if you are used to the high grade US version, these really kind of suck.</li>
            <li> I have found to be very useful</li>
            <li> Happy customer  fast shipping decent price......</li>
            <li> so I could enjoy the consistently smooth clean shaves for which I have become accustomed.</li>
            <li> price is high, but each cartridge lasts about a week, and simply provides the best shave money can buy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It stays nice a smooth and cut free for weeks after I start a new blade and with the Sensor</li>
            <li> These are must have if  you want clean smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Clean smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> The blades are super easy to replace.</li>
            <li> Its really nice when you start using new blade but after 2-3 use some blades start hurting and do not give smooth shave.</li>
            <li> The blades arrived in original packaging.</li>
            <li> Love these razors, don&#x27;t be concerned they are the real thing!</li>
            <li> Many Years Ago, when they first came out.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed and a much better price than elsewhere.</li>
            <li> with these razors, purchase Earth Friendly Products Shower Cleaner with Tea Tree Oil from Amazon as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve canceled my subscription and would rather pay more for higher quality.</li>
            <li> So you already love the brand and the great shave that these blades give you: now you are looking for a reasonable price for the refills, which is the next part of your journey!  </li>
            <li> The razor blades are the original product in the original  packaging.</li>
            <li> The cartridge also has a unique feature.  </li>
            <li> Yes they start out giving a great shave but at $4 a cartridge I expect a little more.</li>
            <li> THE BLADE DOES NOT GIVE A  CLEAN SHAVE.</li>
            <li> I shave my head - so a clean, heavy-duty blade is a must.</li>
            <li> The quality of shave is not at all close and clean and it irritates the skin.</li>
            <li> Gillette offers the best blade on the market and the cost via Amazon beats the local store price.</li>
            <li> If you value a clean shave, this is the way to go.  </li>
            <li> fit as expected and work great.</li>
            <li> and you can bring a 4mm beard to a clean face with few/no next-day pimples.</li>
            <li> It gives me a nice clean shave and feels better than using the regular handle.</li>
            <li> I think they are top of the line for someone who wants a smooth, close, shave without being cut or scraped.</li>
            <li> The single side is great for edging your side burns and those tricky hairs in-between you</li>
            <li> The first one I popped in worked great, such a smooth close save.</li>
            <li> Great value and beats all the other store prices plus is available for Subscribe and Save for the increased discount....</li>
            <li> Somewhere out their their is photographic evidence of a guy going into Walmart to buy razors clean shaven, and coming out with a full beard.</li>
            <li> B004Q6X1E6 Special Sale - 5 Boxes of</li>
            <li> This by far the best razor that I have ever owned my entire life, sharp, clean cut, great price.</li>
            <li> The product is excellent and the service and price is hard to beat.</li>
            <li> the price here on Amazon was by far the best i saw in a long time.</li>
            <li> Thank you for the prompt delivery, great product, what I expected and received.</li>
            <li> They work great - as expected.</li>
            <li> They lasted for almost 12 months; yes, one full year.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t ding them for cost because I still love the result so much.</li>
            <li> Not too much to say, but the Fusion is my favorite razor.</li>
            <li> Good Produst these are like my second order</li>
            <li> But with every razor comes the need for blades (which is what ends up being the true expense of shaving).</li>
            <li> So I was convinced to try dollar shave club after seeing all those cool commercials and checking out the website .So</li>
            <li> Why would you pay full price?</li>
            <li> Sure I could go retro and get a straight razor and strop</li>
            <li> They last a good amount of time.</li>
            <li> have searched for years, trying this product and that for a close shave at a more reasonable cost</li>
            <li> Cool just what I need</li>
            <li> You cannot find the Fusion razor blades anywhere for such a good price.  </li>
            <li> Good deal on a product that I use, daily.  </li>
            <li> Misleading, It&#x27;s not bad, but for whom doesn&#x27;t know the difference between Fusion and Fusion Proglide.</li>
            <li> We have searched and right now, the Subscribe and Save offers the best price compared with our local stores.  </li>
            <li> , make sure you get the right ones for the exact model your handle is or you are stuck.</li>
            <li> Offered a very close and smooth shave and was easy to handle.</li>
            <li> The higher cost is easily off set by the smoothshave and the logevity</li>
            <li> This is another one of the great products that make me cringe whenever I buy them due to the price.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have ordered the fusion cartridges on line and they are working out just fine.</li>
            <li> I was so much impressed with earlier Gillette experience that I did not contact Amazon immediately and kept trying different blades....</li>
            <li> Super value.</li>
            <li> Gillette Fusion gives a nice smooth, longer lasting shave to each blade.&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I had a pregnant moment and ordered these.</li>
            <li> This is a great pack and will last we the whole year since I have a blade sharpener too</li>
            <li> The thing that amazes me the most is that these are five blade razors and they work great on me, even though I have really thick hair.</li>
            <li> I bought from walmart and had a different nice smooth shave .</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll be lucky to get 4-5 days out of these blades.</li>
            <li> They work perfectly on my face and prevent me from going over the same spot multiple times.  </li>
            <li> Quick delivery and price for something used frequently/good product.</li>
            <li> The product came quickly.</li>
            <li> trick is this: the alcohol quickly dries out any moisture.</li>
            <li> Gillette was nice enough to send me a free sample.</li>
            <li> Many of them pointed out a relatively high price of these blades.  </li>
            <li> Great Blades... love the extra blade on the back...</li>
            <li> /&gt;While these are not the cheapest blades on the market, I get a week of comfortable shaves out of each blade, with the seventh being as crisp and free of dulling as the first.</li>
            <li> I was able to shave in the shower like I normally do and just used</li>
            <li> Overall I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> I have used it ever since it was first available.</li>
            <li> They are reliably consistent, providing a time-efficient smooth shave.</li>
            <li> This is the first shave system to give me close comfortable shave without nicks and scratches.</li>
            <li> Thank you so very much!  </li>
            <li> Sensitive skin could be easily irritated!</li>
            <li> So with taking care of it by softening my beard with just warm water before shaving and then using just plain soap to lubricate my face before shaving, then washing it out with just warm water, I was able to make \\&quot;ONE Blade\\&quot; LAST almost a FULL YEAR!</li>
            <li> Was literally about to pay more for half as many razors at a store before finding these!</li>
            <li> so I assume they are pleased at always having a new blade when needed.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m pretty bald, so we&#x27;re not talking a full head of full, lustrous hair, here).</li>
            <li> This was the best deal I could find on the 12 count, and this should last me a long time, but I&#x27;m still always a bit baffled by the price.</li>
            <li> Totally worth it with Super Saver Shipping</li>
            <li> The razors are exactly the same, and are of good quality.</li>
            <li> For that kind of money I would prefer that the blade last me a full month instead of three weeks</li>
            <li> /&gt;Gillette; do your homework and come back with a better bullet the put in my razor or get out of the business!</li>
            <li> Love this deal and these are the blades I have ever had for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> These were the Fusion blades, not the Fusion Proglide like pictured, be aware!  </li>
            <li> Costco next time for sure!</li>
            <li> The difference between the two is pretty significant.</li>
            <li> They last a very long time and the cut they give you is AMAZING!!!!</li>
            <li> Even better it comes in an easy to open and store</li>
            <li> It really is frustration free and if you make sure to order directly from amazon you don&#x27;t have to worry about imitations!</li>
            <li> They have the extra blade for more fine shaving around the nose and sideburns.</li>
            <li> This one is good, especially if you shave head or large areas.</li>
            <li> The price is definitely high, but it provides a very nice, comfortable, extremely close shave without the fiddling of a safety razor system.  </li>
            <li> these are real Gillette razor blade cartridges that will fit a variety of their brand of handles.</li>
            <li> and the blades are comfortable and fast to use.  </li>
            <li> You get a great smooth shave every time, and they last awhile before you need to replace each individual cartridge.</li>
            <li> I am very frugal on the borderline cheap.</li>
            <li> It can be the kind of cut you&#x27;ll actually need to pay attention too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> good quality product is what I expected for that price</li>
            <li> I shall finish by saying that my face is smooth as when I was born and still believed in the magic and power of shaving that inevitably lay ahead of me.</li>
            <li> I have used so many different types of Blades until I received a FREE Gillnetter FUSION Razor in the Mail</li>
            <li> And then more recently to FIND OUT that \\&quot;Amazon.com\\&quot; DISCOUNTED this Product (3 4-packs for about $30.00, PLUS FREE Shipping)</li>
            <li> Kind of like what I got ten years ago.</li>
            <li> : I get about a week&#x27;s worth shaves out each blade.</li>
            <li> They are miles better than the old Mach3 blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I guess that&#x27;s to be expected form a good quality product</li>
            <li> The blades give an extra close shave and have been great on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Still, on pricey side but well worth the money.</li>
            <li> They cost but seem so worth it.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> So they are rare.</li>
            <li> The &#x27;glide strip&#x27; does serve a useful function in smoothing out the stroke.  </li>
            <li> far as quality, there aren&#x27;t many complaints</li>
            <li> I rarely get cuts.  </li>
            <li> You get your moneys worth.</li>
            <li> Nice to know that I don&#x27;t have to worry about going to the store; always have what I need especially for the summer time.</li>
            <li> For a while, he tried the mail order kind that has been advertised recently (dollar shave club), but returned to using this product.</li>
            <li> If you shave your head they are worth checking out.</li>
            <li> These are pricey, but worth the money.</li>
            <li> Good price and arrived as expected.  </li>
            <li> These blades give a nice shave, but even with 5 blades on them the shave only lasts for one day.  </li>
            <li> The shaves after the first few are great, but nothing like the first one with the clean fresh blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I keep trying other blades and razors because of the price I have to pay for the Gillette Fusion blades, but I keep going back to the Gillette Fusion - they&#x27;re just the best blades for me.</li>
            <li> The blades are extremely sharp and leave a nice smooth surface after the shave.</li>
            <li> I have tried many other razors and most of them will cut you once in a while</li>
            <li> The resulting shave and comfort has been better than many other disposable cartridges that I have tried.</li>
            <li> Oh well...there in business to make more money for Procter &amp; Gamble, and so much better than other brands.</li>
            <li> other wise</li>
            <li> Right?...</li>
            <li> The right type of blade for me.</li>
            <li> Stop right there.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s right just set your subscription to how often you would like them delivered.  </li>
            <li> quality razors at the right price</li>
            <li> Very nice sharp blade and glides very well.</li>
            <li> New cartridges are easy to install.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought these for my husband because they are so much cheaper online, and they were exactly what he wanted and in amazon&#x27;s frustration free packaging.  </li>
            <li> I easily get 30 shaves out of each blade so it only costs me about 1 dolla a day to use this fine product.</li>
            <li> I started using my razors, I noticed immediately that I was not getting the close and comfortable shave I had with my older razor.  </li>
            <li> This makes it so much easier to clean after use.</li>
            <li> This is a review for the 12 pack, and is mainly to address some concerns from some people that these might not be genuine.</li>
            <li> The cartridge replacement system is very easy and simple.</li>
            <li> First of all, this is my first razor with 5 blades!</li>
            <li> The trimmer piece also stays sharp for much longer, giving a more comfortable and accurate trim for each razor.</li>
            <li> We love the minimum and non-plastic packaging that Amazon offers: all green and all good for the family budget.  </li>
            <li> Even though I used some of my cash-back bonus, the original price wasn&#x27;t that high.  </li>
            <li> Genuine Gillette Fusion Razor Blade Refills, just like the real thing, because they are the real thing.</li>
            <li> Arrived super fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the same style razor for a few years, and its quality and longevity are superb.</li>
            <li> I like the single blade for trimming nice lines (ie sideburns).</li>
            <li> Ok - this is short and sweet:  If you&#x27;ve never tried a modern, state-of-the-art razor blade, you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re</li>
            <li> It really depends on how close and smooth of a shave you want, and how much you&#x27;re willing to pay for it.</li>
            <li> the package was shipped and delivered very fast.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping as well.</li>
            <li> thank you very much</li>
            <li> Not much to say other than it&#x27;s Gillette (the best a man can get).  </li>
            <li> A good shave but seems a little hi priced</li>
            <li> Very fast and consistent.</li>
            <li> The high quality and fair  price are as expected.</li>
            <li> With some occasional experiments with new brands, once I find what works best on my face, changes to other offerings are glacial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very convenient, somewhat economical, and always there when you need them.</li>
            <li> When I did realize that they were defective, I tried to simply exchange them, but was told that I could no longer do so, as it had already been more than 30 days after my purchase.  </li>
            <li> I will going back to buying from the store and when someone does come with a better blade, I will drop Gilette altogether</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t get much closer than this!</li>
            <li> I have found that cleaning the blade with HOT water after each shave lengthens the time between needing a replacement.</li>
            <li> I have used most of the Gillete series of razors going back to the Sensor.</li>
            <li> daughter actually saw them in a Costco and innocently asked me why I don&#x27;t use them, so I tried them.</li>
            <li> I have used the Gillette Fusion razor since it first came out.  </li>
            <li> Seem to be the same as those sold in stores as they give me just as many shaves.</li>
            <li> By rinsing the gunk off with hot water after shaving, spraying the razor with shower cleaner, then propping it against the wall the durability improves dramatically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> first use they hurt to to use</li>
            <li> Threse ones irritate my skin in the first use.</li>
            <li> First I shave with the Gillette Body blade.</li>
            <li> OKay the fact is the razor industry has conned us all into buying their over priced fancy multiple blade disposable razors.</li>
            <li> Just like in the description, fast delivery, quality!</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> I am hoping this latest pack will last me a minumum of 18 months.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why more people aren&#x27;t demanding the vibrating razors, as regular ones irritate the skin.</li>
            <li> this is the first razor my husband demands.</li>
            <li> Thanks for experience!</li>
            <li> It gives a pretty close shave, but nothing to get ecstatic about.</li>
            <li> I love the Fusion razor, so no complaints there, but I do have to call into question the idea that 12 cartridges will last me a year.</li>
            <li> just think Gillette should lay off advertising the bulk pack as a year&#x27;s worth, since most guys (I know, at least) go through more than one cartridge a month.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Have a styptic pencil at the ready!</li>
            <li> This was the first time I&#x27;ve purchased a Gillette Fusion razor, because the price here in bulk was cheaper than in packs of 4.</li>
            <li> I love the trimming blade on the back.  </li>
            <li> I switched last year to the Gillette Fusion razor (ProGlide) - and love it.</li>
            <li> These razors are exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> I would have to pay lot more at the store for the same number of blades.</li>
            <li> This is exactly like the packs I used to buy at Target</li>
            <li> Thanks Gillette!</li>
            <li> As advertised and must be the real thing!</li>
            <li> Walmart is much higher priced.</li>
            <li> I bought some from my local grocery store just to be sure.</li>
            <li> I bought the batch of 12, it came exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> Expensive but the best</li>
            <li> I have used most of the Gillete series of razors going back to the Sensor.</li>
            <li> Blades are the same as in a store, but price is better.</li>
            <li> I will buy more packages in the future.</li>
            <li> The blades and lubrication strip are pretty trashed after 2-3 days.</li>
            <li> Last longer dont have to worry to buy it many times</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Gillette products for several years now, always switching to the latest product.</li>
            <li> Make sure you take care of the blades so they will last longer.</li>
            <li> These were the best price I could fined for the 12 pack which is still expensive.</li>
            <li> Best razors on the market, but too expensive.</li>
            <li> My first cartridge lasted a week before it needed to be replaced.</li>
            <li> I dumped the razor and all the blades and went back to the gellette fusion, it does a much better job.</li>
            <li> precision trimmer is my favorite part of the product, assisting me in &#x27;squaring&#x27; off the back of my neckline&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> I grew my beard out 2 weeks before trying this out for the first time.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this blade!!</li>
            <li> This is my first time using this razor</li>
            <li> My husband has been using these for years, but this is the first time we purchased them on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> and i will probably go without shaving for a while ;)</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> When I first started using the Fusion razor</li>
            <li> These razor blades are awesome but so expensive in stores.  </li>
            <li> A great value and a common sense schedule to receive shipments</li>
            <li> Each cartridge had five blades, which at first sounds like it would make the razor too large to use on your face, but I was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was to shave with this razor.</li>
            <li> Get free shipping and no tax on top of that and cut your costs down to about $50.00 per year.  </li>
            <li> its a good razor maybe it will cut down on having to buy them so much.</li>
            <li> Very sharp and works great on sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> For as long as I live in the US, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy razor blades any other way again; this is perfect.</li>
            <li> They fit and they work just fine as expected.</li>
            <li> They give you a very nice close shave but don&#x27;t seem to last very long before they start dulling.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t happen to me and providence called me to other shores, for instance I started a hamburger stand called Hamburglers but was put out of business by a lawsuit from McDonald&#x27;s who own the rights to the character Hamburglar</li>
            <li> sharp and cut nice.</li>
            <li> LOL I&#x27;m serious.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this necessity for shaving sensitive skin is completely cost prohibitive for many and really Gillette, you&#x27;re an American brand of the people...</li>
            <li> harry&#x27;s blades (www.harrys.com) are much cheaper, better and last longer.</li>
            <li> I have bought the 12 pack of these razors three times and even though back in 2011 they were only $30, they are stil a good deal at $42.  </li>
            <li> really like how the top of the blade is left uncovered.</li>
            <li> They are the same as in the store, but more reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I had found these on line and saved a few bucks since as a Prime member I get free shipping and no tax.  </li>
            <li> This product is very good for shaving on daily basis, because it is clean, easy to use, fast to be replaced when it is old and most importantly, it is very easy to see when the blades are no longer sharp (because of the blue / green line righ above it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I use each blade 2-3 times - and for me, am happy to have finally found &amp;#34;my solution&amp;#34; for shaving that eluded me for many years with numerous previous razor systems and blades that I have tried.</li>
            <li> blades in the store are much more expensive not that this is cheap but better</li>
            <li> The first time you use with, you will feel it gently glide against your skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing it will be a long time before I need to buy more.</li>
            <li> Very timely, product was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> These blades work very well at first</li>
            <li> The Gillette Fusion is far superior to any other blade I have ever used.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s really good for small places.</li>
            <li> The price is high, but I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different brands and types and these are still my favorite.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend buying Gillette Fusion razors and refills, especially when they go on sale, many times you can get coupons for them too.</li>
            <li> They also last longer than most other cartridges, giving me more shaves for my dollar over all.</li>
            <li> I have SUPER sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> used Amazons Subscribe and Save for the easy of use since my family uses razors at a regular interval.</li>
            <li> But for the first time since I started shaving almost 20 years ago, I can finally say I&#x27;ve found a comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> Did next expect the easy shaving compared to the Shick 3 razors.</li>
            <li> Helps to save on the large cost of disposable razors.</li>
            <li> These blades are super sharp but easily glide across my face.</li>
            <li> they do much better job and appear sharper than any other Gillette razors, I will keep buying these over any other kind</li>
            <li> 4 or 5 shaves max out of the old Sensor where I can use these blades for a good month and a half before I feel the need to replace them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to buying an 8-pack for the same price they&#x27;re charging for a 12-pack, and I had to drive out and hunt down the best deal at my local supermarket, target, or drugstore.</li>
            <li> Overall, it works fine.</li>
            <li> However, these really are priced great - at $2 less per blade than our local big-box store.</li>
            <li> These arrived quickly and new (as expected) and I think they are ridiculously priced by Gillette, but this is the best price I&#x27;ve found them for.</li>
            <li> Nice little discount when you buy the 12 count.</li>
            <li> I also began spraying them with Clean Shower as another reviewer suggested, they last much longer!</li>
            <li> Not that this is not the Fusion ProGlide, which are a bit nice, but also a bit more expensive.</li>
            <li> If you like to not have to pay extra to buy overpriced Razor heads every few months this is a great way.</li>
            <li> is appreciated price-wise.</li>
            <li> These are the real Gillette Fusion blades.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> The razor blades were received extremely fast from vendor.</li>
            <li> ; I used to really believe that when I was 18.</li>
            <li> I was nervous buying this because I thought that maybe I was not getting the real deal with this.  </li>
            <li> The shave with this blade is very close.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping recied exactl what i wanted.</li>
            <li> Thanks AMAZON for these deals.</li>
            <li> Expected better.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper this way than at the store in town.</li>
            <li> From the very beginning, there were no cuts or irritation at all.</li>
            <li> I really like the shave I get</li>
            <li> The blades are cheaper than in the store but work very well.</li>
            <li> So much cheaper than any where else</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> These razors raze very well.</li>
            <li> The pack was much cheaper than I can find in a store.</li>
            <li> These are the real thing.  </li>
            <li> [He is on medication that stiumlates hair growth, so the beard is abnormally fast growning.]Gillette Fusion Manual does the trick for him.</li>
            <li> Then I use these Proglide blades for an even closer shave without putting too much mileage on them.</li>
            <li> I am really considering switching to a straight razor.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Beware that these razors are IMITATORS of real Fusion blades.  </li>
            <li> They look identical but they are not the real deal.  </li>
            <li> Very convenient and advantageous to book immediately packaging.</li>
            <li> we really need 3 blades?&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I used to pay twice as much for.</li>
            <li> I was using cheap razors that you would have to keep going over the same spot and would pull at the neck line a lot.</li>
            <li> I think it works very well</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t pay much attention to the &amp;#34;green&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> blade contours to the shape of your face, without having to put much pressure.</li>
            <li> The 5 blades give a very close shave, and I didn&#x27;t even have to use any shaving cream.</li>
            <li> received a Gillette fusion Razor and replacement cartridge through Gillette as sample to try, and I have to say I really like it.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than retail outlets.</li>
            <li> What the man wants the man gets.</li>
            <li> These seem to be real Gillette Fusion blades.  </li>
            <li> I thought they might be fakes but they seem to be real ones.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t worry, they are real.  </li>
            <li> we did not have to wait a whole month for him to start using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;booboo&#x27;s girl</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.  </li>
            <li> In fact recently I had the opportunity from BzzAgent to try these blades for free.  </li>
            <li> MUCH cheaper than buying refills at a department store.</li>
            <li> that even when the real thing is in front of them, they won&#x27;t see it.</li>
            <li> Real blades and cheaper than anywhere else.</li>
            <li> I bought theses with the hopes of saving some cash and for my surprise it turned out that these razors are cheap Chinese knock off</li>
            <li> I use them on my entire body except for my face as I use an Electric Razor for that, but my body is smooth when I use these blades.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> An absolute must for those who want a close shave.  </li>
            <li> Price is reasonable, if you are on subscribe &amp; save plan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Can find cheap at your local discount stores.&lt;br</li>
            <li> These blades are identical to the ones I&#x27;ve been paying twice as much for at Walmart or the drug store.</li>
            <li> I also change the blade every 1-2 weeks depending on how much I shave.  </li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> I use them very sparingly because to me...</li>
            <li> They cannot cost THIS MUCH to</li>
            <li> I have the handle and for what they cost in the store, it really pays to get them on line.</li>
            <li> and they work very well.</li>
            <li> The blades shipped fast and came as described.</li>
            <li> And the blade on the back is *FANTASTIC* for shaving under my nose.  </li>
            <li> These razor refill cartridges were priced reasonably and get the job done.  </li>
            <li> Buying them in the 12 pack really saves me money.</li>
            <li> I have used the Gillette Fusion blade for years and it gives a smooth and close shave even after multiple uses.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Thanks Gillette for the blades.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this razor!</li>
            <li> That said, the Blades shave really close and smoothly...and they should, for the money Gillette rips us for on their product.  </li>
            <li> You now have real competition.</li>
            <li> but they are not the same as the Pro-Glide blades nor as comfortable on my skin.</li>
            <li> I got these today and hey appear to be the real thing.  </li>
            <li> thanks to bzzagent i am no longer a scruff.</li>
            <li> Gets very close to the skin.  </li>
            <li> Works very well, and is reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li> Let get real guy&#x27;s the commercials are true.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Cheaper than local stores and appears to be genuine Gillette product.</li>
            <li> Cheap and should last for a while</li>
            <li> I just really like a close shave.</li>
            <li> The very cheapest way to get razors.  </li>
            <li> They give me a good shave and one blade will provide at least seven days of close shaves and another 7 days of good-enough shaves.</li>
            <li> I never thought a simple razor (powered by a simple AAA battery) could be so efficient and effective.</li>
            <li> Left to their own devices, the Gillette Fusion could end global hunger and bring world peace.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These are very comfortable and they hold up well compared to other disposable razor heads I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Always helpful to have a small quantity to fit a new razor, be sure to order some.</li>
            <li> However these razors still feel very sharp and give me a great shave for a long period of time.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy them for that reason because every time I start a new blade, it wears off within the first shave.</li>
            <li> Overall, this razor left my face clean and smooth without razor burn or bumps.</li>
            <li> but I really feel like I got more use out of this one compared to other brands.</li>
            <li> they cost more then some other blades but work very well for me &amp;</li>
            <li> But, I&#x27;ve seen better pricing around for other razors.</li>
            <li> Unlike all other razors I&#x27;ve used, you never have access to the top of the blade.</li>
            <li> As a retired Marine I have kept myself closely shaved for pretty much all my adult life.</li>
            <li> I was expecting it to give extra clean shave, but it didn&#x27;t do it.</li>
            <li> The blades are amazing quality and last a really long time.  </li>
            <li> I think these are generally the most overpriced product I use on a regular basis.  </li>
            <li> It is not worth the bother when Gillette makes such a good product.</li>
            <li> The outer box is plain white, but inside is some kind of special Gillette packaging, and what I received looked exactly like the pictures here on Amazon, complete with Gillette logos, colors, and everything.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Having said that, they do work great and last a long time as long as you rinse them off really well after use.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> 12 count Gillette Fusion Manual Cartridges will keep your face fuzz free for a long time.</li>
            <li> This purchase should last me a full year since I don&#x27;t shave every day.</li>
            <li> Better shave than the average womans razor.</li>
            <li> They are very expensive and the advertisements tout what a wonderful shave you will get</li>
            <li> I am usually a mach 3 kind of guy</li>
            <li> They last a long time for me, usually a month or longer, and continue to provide an excellent shave.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true that I have a coarse beard, but the cost on these equates to around $200.00 per year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> However, the price of the blades is much higher than my old blades.  </li>
            <li> I already love the Gillette brand and knew they wouldn&#x27;t let me down.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is like getting a $50 computer printer and then finding out that new ink costs $75 a pop!</li>
            <li> They work very well in my new power swivel razor, even though I accidentally bought the non-power blades.</li>
            <li> There really isn&#x27;t much like shaving your face with a brand new razor.</li>
            <li> and maybe you&#x27;ll even sell more and have fewer on the black market</li>
            <li> I often go more than a month with the same blade, with no noticeable extra effort needed on head or face.</li>
            <li> I have been to the local store many times and they have you take a card from the shaving area to the cashier (instead of the actual razors).</li>
            <li> they keep coming out with newer blades that are just more and more expensive.  </li>
            <li> and they don&#x27;t have the same issue--the can go many weeks to months on the same blades.</li>
            <li> The problem is the price; they are getting more expensive every time I need to buy more.</li>
            <li> The leave a close shave and last considerably longer than the cheap ones</li>
            <li> Wife and husband both use these both older with thinning skin.</li>
            <li> I figured I would try these razors because Amazon.com has a great return policy if it turned out that these were fake, but I see no indication at all that these are not the real thing.</li>
            <li> I love them both and alternate between them on a monthly basis for the same \\&quot;feel\\</li>
            <li> Every year they seem to get more and more expensive...</li>
            <li> Outstanding price, I order enough for the year for extra savings.</li>
            <li> I change my blades every five to six months, because I find that is how long they last with daily use at optimum performance.</li>
            <li> The ridiculously high price....</li>
            <li> I highly recommend buying this product from amazon.</li>
            <li> I test the disposable blades we keep around for travel bags and guests, these are what those get compared with, and they set a high bar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> The price everywhere is too high in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s a few options, but you can pick them up very cheap at any store:&lt;br /&gt;+</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to anyone needing this razor.</li>
            <li> I always get a great shave with the Gillette Fusion and had been buying these razor cartridges from a local store up until last week when I noticed I could get them online for a lot less.</li>
            <li> Seems fine and as expected.</li>
            <li> Well, after a couple of months using them i can say that the blades are super sharp, leaving my face feel absolutely smooth, while never cutting me, unlike some other blades.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had as many as 50 shaves from one blade or as little as 30 shaves</li>
            <li> Gillette Fusion Manual Razor Blade Refills are the only product available that comfortably removes the heavy beard growth of my son.  </li>
            <li> Great Item, Too expensive but</li>
            <li> These blades really help prevent razor burn and don&#x27;t cut me as much as my old razor did.</li>
            <li> Hubby says they are expensive but work great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never cut my head - only my fingers and rarely, face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Ordered about a month ago and still using only the first one out of whole box - 12 count.</li>
            <li> Far better than the generic knock-offs, but these are definitely pricey!</li>
            <li> , I personally do not find the difference worth the cost.</li>
            <li> The cartridges are certainly more expensive than buying disposable razors, but they provide a much better shave by far.</li>
            <li> economical to purchase versus the drug store, Wal-Mart etc.. delivered to my house on a regular schedule.</li>
            <li> I joined the subscription service for Gillette Fusion Manual Cartridges, the cartridges are legit and through the Amazon subscription service your able to save a few dollars monthly on your purchase of the cartridges.</li>
            <li> They are very expensive, but rather than getting cuts or nicks, they are worth the price and do a great job without irritation.  </li>
            <li> These blades are long lasting (man&#x27;s face), then are demoted for another months or more (ladies legs).</li>
            <li> and he has a heavy beard and requires a lot more time shaving burns up the blades</li>
            <li> I used the Gillette Fusion during my normal shaving over the course of 2 weeks</li>
            <li> They key to getting the most use out of the blades is to rinse the water off with alcohol after use, and then let the blades air dry.</li>
            <li> Make sure you dry the blade after use to make it last longer.</li>
            <li> I went through several brands trying to find the right one</li>
            <li> only and very minor comment is that the trimmer blade on the backside could be slightly smaller which would make it really great for getting at those tough to reach / more precision areas.</li>
            <li> Once you open the box the holder for the fusion manual includes a very large advertisement for the fusion proglide.  </li>
            <li> so I used to have trouble getting a clean shave on the first try.</li>
            <li> But, it&#x27;s a comfortable shave while it&#x27;s sharp.</li>
            <li> Comfortable, sharp get the job done.</li>
            <li> These new blades do not shave the way the ealier ones did.</li>
            <li> i am new to manual shaving, having switched from electric shaving about a year ago.  </li>
            <li> It may be &amp;quot;out-of-the-box&amp;quot; but these replacement blades are brand new.</li>
            <li> It maybe time for a new blade.</li>
            <li> I just haven&#x27;t had time to find a new razor and razor blades, or I would have switched.</li>
            <li> I thought maybe it was me, but I used a brand new Fusion razor that I got through the mail</li>
            <li> The cartridges seemed brand new.</li>
            <li> learn a new language site</li>
            <li> They arrived new and undamaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;These were new and delivered on time if not a bit sooner.</li>
            <li> This is my new razor/blades.</li>
            <li> It itches, and for days I have to live with the irritation, but these blades have literally changed everything around for me.</li>
            <li> You forget how well they shave when new.</li>
            <li> It is ok but it feels like blades are getting dull to fast , and for that price they shouldn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s super sharp, it&#x27;s also quite gentle, in case anybody was thinking about &#x27;manscaping&#x27; with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> With 5 blades I don&#x27;t have to shave the same spot on my face multiple times, the first stroke gets it done right.  </li>
            <li> All that said, these blades give a close, comfortable shave and last for multiple shaves.  </li>
            <li> They shave me smoothly and closely and they last for weeks of daily shaving before they start to &#x27;grab&#x27; my beard.  </li>
            <li> It might cost more, but at least I know they are real.</li>
            <li> Delivery took just a few days, much shorter than promised, plus shipping was free.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Amazon for frustration free (and less) packaging!</li>
            <li> Thanks to Amazon for frustration free (and less) packaging!</li>
            <li> They are effective at cutting the hair, and they seem to last a good long time.  </li>
            <li> so he replaced the first blade with a 2nd new blade.</li>
            <li> They looked to be brand new and owed as such upon first time use.</li>
            <li> Scrapes large amounts of thick hair effectively without letting enough blood to send me to the ER.</li>
            <li> The blades are long lasting, don&#x27;t rust, and are easy to change.</li>
            <li> Helped trim around my mustache perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;The cartridges last a really long time and are easy to replace.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s still something to be aware of - if you screw up with these blades, especially if you&#x27;re using them for headshaving, your mistake will not be painlessly forgiven.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> With my sensitive skin, these 5 bladed things are a must!</li>
            <li> I generally get about 15-20 shaves out of one blade (but then again I don&#x27;t have a very dense beard)..</li>
            <li> thing I notice is that I have cut myself more often with these than I have before with the stock blades, not sure the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These seem like the same exact blades I have bought in the store.</li>
            <li> I could start feeling the use on that blade after the first or second shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I personally think the 5 closely packed blades make it more difficult to rinse and fill up faster requiring more rinsing.</li>
            <li> At first I thought perhaps my facial hair had gotten coarser or something caused the faster dulling</li>
            <li> I shredded my face about the 3rd or 4th use of the first blade.</li>
            <li> Look Sharp, Feel Sharp Gillette is a great shave just like the old 1950s commercial that I saw on tv when I was young.</li>
            <li> but these just seem to be engineered in a different way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s worth it to spend a little more and get razors that work properly.</li>
            <li> These are more expensive than most, but they last longer than your typical cheap razor.  </li>
            <li> I would rather pay a high price for the handle and a lower price for the refills, ESPECIALLY in these economic times!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not much to say really, they worked fine and lasted a long time.</li>
            <li> ,my search these many years,( I am 60), has finally come to fruition with a better quality, better shave, and reasonable cost compared to the outrageous prices that Gillette gets for their product.  </li>
            <li> It was able to handle a thick beard with ease and get closer than my regular razor on just the first shave.</li>
            <li> These cost less than getting 6 from my local stores so why not get more for your money?  </li>
            <li> /&gt;These blades will cut your face and only last about a week - if you are lucky.</li>
            <li> Tried a different brand recently--a subscription of Harry&#x27;s.  Looked nice and was definitely cheaper to buy, but didn&#x27;t come close to the quality and sharpness of the Gillette Fusion blades and didn&#x27;t last nearly as long.  </li>
            <li> but, you know, I went to a barber in Managua, Nicaragua and had a shave with a straight razor, which is single blade, and that shave lasted for two whole days.  </li>
            <li> I have an Average Density and Medium Beard Texture, so in my First Experience I really wanted to Test this NEW Blade.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally, unlike the packaging that Fusion blades come from big box/club stores in: these arrive in a simple and easy to open container:</li>
            <li> This is only a review of the refills, not a of the Fusion razor system.&lt;br /&gt;Buying refills in quantity is nice, besides the cost savings, because of less plastic packaging found in local retail stores.&lt;br /&gt;Actually, there is no outer plastic packaging when purchased like this</li>
            <li> While this is a big change compared to dual blade razors, they seem to dull fairly quickly, and the moisturizing strip doesn&#x27;t seem to last more than 3-4 days for me.  </li>
            <li> I felt these were not original gillete, the blades when shaving did not have the smooth shave.</li>
            <li> If you like the Gillette brand, spend a little more and buy them from your local store.  </li>
            <li> My favorite razor blades, but they seem to get dull faster than before.  </li>
            <li> To make them last VERY long, just take your thumb and give the blades a downward wipe or two to clean them off after shaving and rinsing them.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re expensive, but they last a while and give a great shave.</li>
            <li> I find that I can use one blade for three weeks, but clearly at that time, they need to be replaced.</li>
            <li> these razors are clearly imitations of the real ones,the wear out almost instantly and no matter how careul you are, you will cut your face and have ingrown hair</li>
            <li> and it all gets more confusing than helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We know you&#x27;re only charging so much because you can.  </li>
            <li> Cheapest price I have found so far...</li>
            <li> I used to use double-edged blades and frequently had razor burn, cuts, scrapes, etc.</li>
            <li> WOW  </li>
            <li> The only - and real problem - with them?  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ve just stuck with it so far.</li>
            <li> After product arrived, I was pleasantly surprised that these blades came directly from the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> There seem to be a lot of concerns that these may be factory seconds or knock-offs -- I found 8-packs direct from Gillette on their shop.gillette.com website for about $3/each, guaranteed to be factory originals.  </li>
            <li> These are the same refills on retail packaging, but at a much lower price.</li>
            <li> These are definitely not the same blades as I normally buy - after the first two shaves they tear your face up - sub-standard for the Gillette name to be associated.</li>
            <li> My 18 year old loves the Gillette Fusion Razors.</li>
            <li> He has sensitive skin and these blades don&#x27;t irritate him like others.</li>
            <li> To save as much money as possible I now dab the razon on a bathroom towel after each use and it seems to extend the life of each razor by about a month.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I am just getting old.</li>
            <li> I feel like I should just buy a whole razor next time instead of the razor refills.</li>
            <li> I use to buy at my local drug store but was paying way too much.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s also very helpful that the lubrication strip will turn to white</li>
            <li> I am at about 10-12 shaves so far</li>
            <li> and it seems like I can get at least 3-5 more.</li>
            <li> They are much cheaper than what you can find them for at the local store.  </li>
            <li> This item was purchased and fulfilled by Amazon directly.  </li>
            <li> Overall, since the official Gillette blades last for a month, we are all better off financially bying the official ones in a standard shop.</li>
            <li> your going to need razors for the rest of your adult life</li>
            <li> I have a sensitive face and these razors help reduce the bumps from ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money.  </li>
            <li> I am 50 years old and had used Gillette Trac II forever, until these came along.</li>
            <li> It is very convenient to get it almost next day to your door</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not &amp;#34;like new&amp;#34;, but it definitely takes the scratchy edge off the shave and makes it reasonable.  </li>
            <li> Let my skin baby soft.</li>
            <li> The five blades feel like they glide over my sensitive skin and did not leave razor burn or bumps.</li>
            <li> I also purchased directly from Amazon and didn&#x27;t have any problems of having any knock offs.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have tried the newer Proglide Fusion blades, but personally don&#x27;t think they are worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> These razor blades claim that &amp;#34;Just one 12-count blade refill can give you a full year of shaves (based on average days of use per refill)&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I have tried the newer Proglide Fusion blades, but personally don&#x27;t think they are worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> Expensive but good.  </li>
            <li> Expensive, but they&#x27;re good.</li>
            <li> I like the case it comes in, makes it easy to keep up with all of the blades and takes up very little space.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally write a negative review unless I feel strongly about letting people know they should avoid the product at all cost, and this falls under that category.</li>
            <li> The strip doesn&#x27;t last long, but it&#x27;s still a super razor.</li>
            <li> long, Gillette, I&#x27;m no longer paying your extraordinary prices, which is why I only rate you at three stars.  </li>
            <li> I know I can&#x27;t go back to buying other cheap razors I used to buy.</li>
            <li> Sharp, has the 1 blade to trim and the 5 blades to give a close shave (heck i sound like their commercial).</li>
            <li> They wear out much faster than I expected and they don&#x27;t give me the close shave I want, but they sell at a decent price.  </li>
            <li> : I found that storing my razor vertically with the blades down has been a tremendous help in extending the life of my blades.  </li>
            <li> The lubrication strip will be nearly gone after your first use and definitely gone by your second shave.  </li>
            <li> It will flay the skin along several lines, and it can be pretty deep, and it will bleed a lot.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t feel any different than the much higher priced blades that I buy in the big box stores.</li>
            <li> I can usually get at least a dozen great shaves from one blade.  </li>
            <li> Please be aware that these blades are not official Gillette blades and that they will only last for one week each before they are blunt.</li>
            <li> To avoid it, I only use these high quality blades.  </li>
            <li> This was my last purchase of these high priced blades.</li>
            <li> you have thoughts of changing your shave style I highly recommend watching the enormous amount of videos on You</li>
            <li> The blades offer a smooth, close shave with very little pull.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not so much the pack of razor blades that perk me up as much as the whole package of getting them for a decent price considering they are so expensive and knowing it will work for me for a whole year.</li>
            <li> I am a woman and this is a mans razor , but it is the only razor I have found that leaves Everthing smooth including all the odd angled places.</li>
            <li> These blades are very expensive but work great.  </li>
            <li> and they actually last longer than the normal 2 blade cartridges.</li>
            <li> Not much to say, they r the real thing!</li>
            <li> It does pay to be particularly careful with the first couple of shaves to avoid nicking yourself while the blade is at its sharpest.</li>
            <li> tried several of these from a 24 count purchase and they all feel like just before I toss them for a new one, like they have been used??</li>
            <li> I finally decided it was time to get a new set of razors.  </li>
            <li> These are so expensive, but with Amazon we get an amazing deal and since the blade doesn&#x27;t require as frequent changes and the shave lasts longer</li>
            <li> The only real downside to it that I can see is that I think they could last longer.  </li>
            <li> I do wish that the moisturizing strips, and razor as a whole would last just a big longer.  </li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t get into tight places, like under the nose, and cut myself more than with any other razor.</li>
            <li> did not like-blades were not sharp</li>
            <li> no other co makes comparable razors.</li>
            <li> It might take extra work, but the blade rinses easily and a little extra time is all that&#x27;s needed.&lt;br</li>
            <li> IT APPEARS GENUINE GILLETTE BLADES ARE BLACK AND GREY</li>
            <li> Typically I&#x27;m skeptical of \\&quot;premium\\&quot; brand names, but I&#x27;ve used mach 3, a few generic razors, and earlier Gillette models, and I have to admit the Gillette Fusion cartridges are the best.</li>
            <li> They last a long time if you clean them and dry them after each use!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands in the past and Gillette is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> Overall, provides clean shave with few to no nicks.</li>
            <li> I have been shaving with these for as long as they have been out and never run into this problem with what I buy at the drug store (except the price is stupidly high).</li>
            <li> ) they blades &amp;#34;out of the box&amp;#34; are fantastic, but on my beard they get dull within days.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing how expensive razors have become.</li>
            <li> they really dot last long.</li>
            <li> I am 63 Years Old Male and have been Shaving since I was Sixteen Years Old.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit that this is the only type I&#x27;ve used so far</li>
            <li> which I consider the bane of being a guy but look forward to getting done for the sake of looking professional, pleasing the lady, and not having a scraggly beard or whiskers), I&#x27;ve always wanted to shave as close as possible and not cut myself while shaving.</li>
            <li> I have been using them for years with Gillette Sensitive Skin Shaving Cream as I shave my entire body, (legs, arms, underarms, butt, and these blades</li>
            <li> barely give me a weeks shave.  </li>
            <li> No razor burn, and barely even a scrape.</li>
            <li> I used to dread shaving because my skin was so sensitive, by the next day</li>
            <li> It was a big improvement from my old razor.  </li>
            <li> I went back to my old Mach III for a while to save some money and things I have noticed</li>
            <li> Sad, because I really liked the idea of saving by bulk buying.</li>
            <li> They are also kind of expensive per each blade.</li>
            <li> I would have to trim my beard down with clippers first and then shave.</li>
            <li> The trick to long lasting razors is to dry the as quickly and as often as possible.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as close as they may advertise and takes a few strokes to get things right.  </li>
            <li> I also wished they held up a little better for a little longer.  </li>
            <li> Hard to get too excited about razor blades, but I like these.</li>
            <li> Decent Quality and last a long time for the price you pay.</li>
            <li> Very affordable compare to other places</li>
            <li> There are other blades out thier that dont cost as much and dont force you to buy a handle for each and every blade.</li>
            <li> Having tried 1-5 blades, 5 blades definitely makes a difference especially if you have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> If you need a clean shave for thick stubble, this should work for you.</li>
            <li> Decent price, but not much below retail</li>
            <li> Came in a nice cardboard case so it wasn&#x27;t difficult to open which was helpful.  </li>
            <li> Again, some blades were good others I could feel cutting me on the same shave.</li>
            <li> They last a long time (3-4 weeks of daily shaving for each blade) and stay super sharp.  </li>
            <li> Not sharp enough.</li>
            <li> The only major problem is that they are a bit pricey.  </li>
            <li> Arrived exactly as expected, high quality.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and thick hair and these work GREAT but are so expensive locally.</li>
            <li> Slightly disappointed because I thought these were proglide, but still a great deal.  </li>
            <li> He already had the razor but generally purchased smaller packs of blades.</li>
            <li> My recommendation is to buy an old fashioned double edge razor and experiment with double edged blades from various makers until you find one that you like.</li>
            <li> I wish I would have read the reviews before I ordered these blades, these are definitely sub-standard blades, not sure why, they look genuine and I trust that Amazon sells only genuine items like this, they are very dull and hurt to shave, definitely can&#x27;t use these, guess I will just pay the store price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shave down and with gentle strokes</li>
            <li> As a matter fact I really can&#x27;t tell you how long they last, is long enough that when I start noticing it pulling</li>
            <li> Clean them properly and they will last at least three times as song.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re fantastic, and I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s because of the lubrication strip, or just the blades, but when I use these, I have absolutely no irritation on my neck.</li>
            <li> While Costco has priced their product a few dollars more, my past experience shows me</li>
            <li> Most blades that get thrown out are not dull, they are just dirty.  </li>
            <li> used another Gillette product (Excel blades) for nearly 20 years before their availability became limited.</li>
            <li> (There is a single razor on the back of the cartridge for close quarter trimming or to create clean edges and small areas.)</li>
            <li> I see P&amp;G now responding to negative posts so going to give these one more shot since the price is $5 to $10 less than in stores.  </li>
            <li> Not sure there&#x27;s really a difference between the Fusion and other Gilette razors really.</li>
            <li> You can gussy them up with all the high tech whohas and futuristic colors and names but in the dark they all shave the same.</li>
            <li> Just your average everyday razor, nothing special or something to write home about.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and each razor lasts for a fair amount of time, so it&#x27;s bad</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the Schick multiblade razors and they feel dull and used right out of the box; they left my face very red and sore.  </li>
            <li> After 3 or 4 shaves, they would start giving me razor burn and some right out of the package seemed dull.  </li>
            <li> The way the prices for Men&#x27;s Fusion Manuel Cartridges being very costly and giving your hard earned dollars a very close shave, these 12 Fusion Cartridges for the price charged is a sharp deal.</li>
            <li> I have a very thick beard and this razor did an excellent job at cutting through the hair that has proven too tough for most other razors!</li>
            <li> Granted, I have a very coarse beard and sensitive skin, so regardless of whether I shave every day, every other day, or once a week, I&#x27;m still getting skin irritation by the 7th or 8th day.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These blades are about 20% cheaper on Amazon.com than they are in any other store near me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Lotion Strip is pretty meaningless, it does not last very long&lt;</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve cut myself quite a few times, usually on the fingers when I&#x27;m switching hands, or other accidents - and the multiple blades guarantee more than a nick.</li>
            <li> It fits my Fusion razor as stated, the product is new and it was much less than the price at Walmart.</li>
            <li> they fit well and is a whole lot less expensive through Amazon .</li>
            <li> The thing that dulls most razor blades quickly is hard water deposits of calcium and other minerals that build up on the blades when they dry after rinsing.</li>
            <li> The lubricating strip doesn&#x27;t last as long as the blades sometimes, and Gillette notes when it is white - to replace the head -</li>
            <li> The cartridges are very simple to change out and last a long time.</li>
            <li> The only reason I removed a star is that the lube strip on these did not seem to last nearly as long as the ones bought in the store.</li>
            <li> Normally when I use my regular razor that would spell trouble for my face.</li>
            <li> I use these blades because the razors does well with multiple shaves, and has a single rear blade to handle parts such as the upper lip, and chin.</li>
            <li> They do not go dull very fast either; I shave at least 5 times a week and still am using the first blade after 3 weeks.  </li>
            <li> Single blade on the top of the cartridge is useless in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Being a long time Gillette razor user, I&#x27;ve come to find out that blades can last</li>
            <li> Ther long lasting and a close shave weather</li>
            <li> Your razors will last 4 times as long, guaranteed.</li>
            <li> These were cheaper than buying in the store, and they seem to last as long as the blades from the store.</li>
            <li> The blades last a long time.</li>
            <li> I have been using this style of razor for long enough to know they work</li>
            <li> but it seemed they didn&#x27;t last as long.  </li>
            <li> I once used a blade for an entire year, just to see how long they hold up.</li>
            <li> but they have lasted as long as the ones I have bot from the big box stores.</li>
            <li> These blades don&#x27;t last as long as the Fusions in store.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;You get what you pay for - these blades last a long, long time, spreading their initial purchase price over three, four,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried drying it off after using it, but it doesn&#x27;t extend the life that long (and it seems like a big expense based up on the sort</li>
            <li> I may have to try the shower cleaner trick to see how long I can make the Hydro&#x27;s last.</li>
            <li> They provide a shave, but it seems to me that they don&#x27;t last as long as the Gillette branded blades.</li>
            <li> For some reason, they don&#x27;t seem to last nearly as long as others I&#x27;ve purchased from Gillette</li>
            <li> And do not last as long as I remember they used to.</li>
            <li> I bitch about the price of these blades every time, but always buy them because they last so incredibly long.  </li>
            <li> These blades last me a long time.</li>
            <li> These last a long time.</li>
            <li> Work well and last a long time.</li>
            <li> The blades last a long time and don&#x27;t get clogged with hair.</li>
            <li> These blades last a long time.</li>
            <li> They had to have changed their formula or made it so the blades do not last as long.</li>
            <li> These blades do not last as long as the ones I buy in the store.</li>
            <li> They Don&#x27;t seem to last as long as the ones I buy in the store, but they appeared​ to be legitimately packaged, just not the type of packaging I&#x27;m used to.</li>
            <li> The shave is clean and usually just a few passes with the blade will do the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Packaging looks legit, but the blades are not sharp and the goo above the blades is not fresh.</li>
            <li> I already had a couple other blades left from a purchase I made at a local store prior to ordering these, so did not have to use these for over a month after I ordered them.  </li>
            <li> These blades last a long time use them 4 my face and head!</li>
            <li> carton, not those extra sharp plastic packages you can only open with a scissor.</li>
            <li> My husband has a rough time shaving because his beard re-growth is coarse and white.  </li>
            <li> The biggest improvement of these over traditional razors is the &#x27;drag&#x27; that simply dissappears.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Honestly, if I hadn&#x27;t discovered I could make a single razor last a month I wouldn&#x27;t bother buying these.</li>
            <li> On the back of the cartridge there is a single blade, which works wonders for getting even sideburns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Expensive, but they shave smooth and last a long time.</li>
            <li> Some reviewers (old reviews I think) have said that these blades were knockoffs but that is not true.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;- Severely less tug and pull during the first few uses of each blade</li>
            <li> said I had a friend that convinced me to return to the old school single blade double edge safety razor and after a little bit of a learning curve</li>
            <li> I gave a 4-star review basically for cost...because the cartridges can be a bit more expensive than other brands....</li>
            <li> They are sharp and get the job done - especially on Monday mornings when I have a lot of coarse hair.</li>
            <li> But even they dull fairly fast and having an option to buy in quantity</li>
            <li> You COULD get all manly and stuff and get a straight razor, but the blood stains are hard to get out.</li>
            <li> Dull very fast..Will not buy again</li>
            <li> This shipped in a 100% frustration free package in a little paper box, unlike the burglary proof plastic-sealed retail cases you find locked up behind glass in your local store that treats you like a would-be shop-lifter.</li>
            <li> If you use these blades, they are the real deal for at least $4 cheaper</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll get at least twice as much out of each blade when compared to these blades.</li>
            <li> I have used these blades for a long time, and have never had any problems.</li>
            <li> I know we&#x27;re all careful with blades, but this one deserves a bit of extra care and attention - it will not forgive any carelessness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do shave twice a week and my hair is not a soft ones.</li>
            <li> we&#x27;ve used them for a long time and will continue to do so...</li>
            <li> I USE GILLETE FUSSION LONG TIME</li>
            <li> HOW LONG I&#x27;LL</li>
            <li> But these razors do the job all month long.  </li>
            <li> Also I am happy I finally found my ALL YEAR LONG pack instead of paying the OUTRAGEOUS prices at my local retail stores for a 2,4  or 6 pack.</li>
            <li> I have tried the Gillette Fusion for a few days now and WOW.</li>
            <li> I gave this 4 stars as I really never found a use for the extra blade (for trimmings).</li>
            <li> the Turbo blades are not nearly as goods they used to be either.</li>
            <li> the gillette Fusion has been my go to blade for a long time.</li>
            <li> an using Gillette long time over 15 years.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> WHICH IS THE COLOR OF THESE GREY.</li>
            <li> I have been buying these for myself and my boyfriend for as long as they have been produced.</li>
            <li> I have to think; how long ago did I change this thing?</li>
            <li> You can get extra life out of the cartridges by shaving backwards along your forearm 25 to 50 strokes when it starts getting rough.  </li>
            <li> If you are careful about cleaning after use they will last a bit longer.</li>
            <li> I am a LONG time user of Gillette Fusion blades.  </li>
            <li> Different color than what I expected, but who cares?  </li>
            <li> While I do use the extra single blade, if that knocked the price down considerably I could do with the 5 on the other side.  </li>
            <li> I used a dull blade for over a month and it gave me the same results as a new one.</li>
            <li> They come packaged in a plain white box, but the internal blister pack of cartridges are the same as what we get at the store.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Granted, these are the most expensive razors you&#x27;ll typically see in stores.</li>
            <li> I can usually get through about 3 weeks before needing a new blade.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too small and not sharp enough to do anything</li>
            <li> I get a lot of use out of these blades as they seem to me to last longer than other brands and blade</li>
            <li> I tried other brands,,, keep going back to Gillette.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine going back to any other brand.</li>
            <li> Not as sharp as the store bought blades Do not do the same job...</li>
            <li> Recently learned I should change my blades after every other shave.</li>
            <li> SO LONG, TARGET!</li>
            <li> These blades might be a little more expensive than some others</li>
            <li> I may go in that direction next time, but for this time I utilized my subscribe + save account to couple these with some other items to attain a discount.</li>
            <li> I only rated them 4 stars though due to their price.  </li>
            <li> the Fusion or the other Gillette blades stated above .  </li>
            <li> Priced better than the store, can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lasts very long time and it appeared the cheapest shaving cartridge.</li>
            <li> After each use of the razor, spray with Shower Cleaner and let dry.</li>
            <li> These must be imitation or low grade steel.  </li>
            <li> I used an electric or perhaps electronic razor from age 18 to about 30 when my beard, in response to the McDonald&#x27;s tragedy grew more cynical and rough and I needed to start shaving using a razor.</li>
            <li> Nice replacement blades, always trying to find the least expensive fusion&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Gillette Fusion Cartridges shave like they are used and not new</li>
            <li> But be careful when new, one sharp little thing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I used to use the Schick Titanium with 4 blades and a single trimmer.</li>
            <li> It works without bloodshed and limited burn.</li>
            <li> And my boyfriend, who is required by his work dress code to shave every single day, loves these.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a single cartridge for up to 2 months that way.  </li>
            <li> Feel free to ignore the other reviews that say this product is fake or defective...</li>
            <li> I usually go over a week on a blade, but they start getting tougher to push through the beard near the end.</li>
            <li> Not worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> I hate buying these blades but they are the only blades that I enjoy while shaving off my manly beard without getting a rash on my girly sensitive skin I was blessed with.</li>
            <li> Electric razor first, then use these sparingly, after, so you don&#x27;t go to the poor house.</li>
            <li> my husband uses this razor and loves it but hard to find cartridges as new styles are coming out</li>
            <li> These multi blade Fuzion razors sound ridiculous or at least like over kill, but with my beard they cut through it like butter.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Bought a standard 8 pack at Target to compare and the Target blades were all sharp and lasted one to two weeks!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disgusted and feel ripped off as I could have bought original Gillette blades with my money and gotten so much use out of them!!!</li>
            <li> store- but for a third less.</li>
            <li> My husband has really coarse black hair and these razors</li>
            <li> The color strips on these are orange, when previously they were blue.  </li>
            <li> am moving to an electric shaver because these blades don&#x27;t last like previous blades from 2 years ago that Gillette made.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Shaving isn&#x27;t really a big deal, and we&#x27;re men; we can handle that slight discomfort as a cheaper razor &#x27;pulls&#x27; your hair, but we shouldn&#x27;t just because we can.  </li>
            <li> Ordinarily I don&#x27;t promote other companies products in these reviews, but Gillette&#x27;s been getting fat and rich off of us for years because they didn&#x27;t have any serious competition...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a woman and it became hard to find vibrating razors last year when my old one broke down.</li>
            <li> German made high quality, long lasting blades at about a fourth of the cost when you consider that I get a full two weeks on a blade that costs half of Gillette&#x27;s insane prices.  </li>
            <li> the only problem I have is the refills are a little pricey</li>
            <li> Comes in a little white box with the Gillette logos all over.</li>
            <li> and I do a little trimming on my upper cheeks</li>
            <li> My husband has a tough, fast growing beard.</li>
            <li> Was happen with the product and the time to receive it for free shipping BUT was very unhappy the credit card i used to purchased with had been compromised was been used to purchase 2 different times air line tickets to Kenya in the same day and a purchase with some</li>
            <li> i use the just place head of blade in some soap water just to cover head, alse sharpen blade with  jeans a old pair move blade up ,pushing forward like 10 times no need to press hard  .</li>
            <li> I have bough this same style of blade before (for years) and this order seems to not quite as close shaving or sharp as the previous ones</li>
            <li> If your a die hard Gillette fan please understand that Gillette does still have double edge razor blades for sale (they are made and sold by their overseas company) and they used t produce a lot of double edge razors</li>
            <li> These are good razors and a grate value, but there just not very good on my neck gives me bad razor burn other than that they are grate...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really a no brainer to have the razor blades delivered as a reoccurring order.  </li>
            <li> I have a rough beard.</li>
            <li> They came delivered as expected.</li>
            <li> Just as I expected.</li>
            <li> Of course, just be careful when using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The blades perform exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> so I roughly save 5-8 bucks.</li>
            <li> Lately, not so much.</li>
            <li> Yes, they are expensive, but they are worth the money.</li>
            <li> Ordered and got what expected.</li>
            <li> The blades provide a rough shave and cut into the skin.  </li>
            <li> Expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> I used the Gillette Fusion a few years back and don&#x27;t know why I stopped using it.</li>
            <li> Arrived on-time and as expected.</li>
            <li> I do know that the blades from this pack felt rough and scratched my skin.</li>
            <li> but the quality is not what I expected.</li>
            <li> I shave my face everyday since I don&#x27;t like facial hair.  </li>
            <li> Smoother shave, no nicks or bumps, and they last a few weeks each cartridge.</li>
            <li> Timely delivery, and was as expected.</li>
            <li> As expected and cheaper than the Navy Commissary.  </li>
            <li> All as ordered and expected.</li>
            <li> Not much else to say.</li>
            <li> Still have a few left too</li>
            <li> Not much to say here.  </li>
            <li> (I shave a lot, I am in the military and have been for twenty years) with this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll continue  using them since I spent  the money on them but will not re-order this item.</li>
            <li> The long razers take less times to cover my head.  </li>
            <li> These Fusion blades do not klast 5 shaves the green strip turns white and the blades are not that sharp.</li>
            <li> No more paying too much at a store because a blade is dull and the box is empty.</li>
            <li> so I use less blades and ultimately spen less with fusion blades</li>
            <li> I have a pretty weak beard, so I can usually get 6 months to a year out of a single cartridge.</li>
            <li> The five blades adds a smoothness that I never really got from other razors.  </li>
            <li> They seem to last a really long time before getting painfully dull.</li>
            <li> Buying new blades for your razor is never a pleasant experience.</li>
            <li> In fact, the only times I&#x27;ve had a cut is from accidentally nicking myself with the single blade if I carelessly move the blades near my face.</li>
            <li> I usually get a month out of my blades, so this 12 pack should last me about a year.</li>
            <li> I usually get a week or longer use from each blade and the comfort remains the same.</li>
            <li> yes, does yours have the one on the other side?</li>
            <li> God price for extremely overpriced razors.</li>
            <li> Using these blades while sharp I almost never nick myself.</li>
            <li> Tried other brands, this blade gives me the closest and smoothest shave.</li>
            <li> Usually when I purchase at the store,  each cartridge last me for about a week.  </li>
            <li> Other simular products that I&#x27;ve used don&#x27;t compare to Gillette Fusions number of shave per blade per blade.</li>
            <li> This razor stays sharp longer than other brands</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the fusion blades for the past 5 years but recently had to buy cheaper ones and paid the price with a nicked up face after shaving.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t as sharp as i thought it will be.</li>
            <li> They are sharp and cut well.</li>
            <li> I shave about every other day due to skin irritation from other razors that I have used.</li>
            <li> I do not even look at other brands or types anymore.</li>
            <li> No need to try other brands.</li>
            <li> Purchasing these with subscribe and save is cheaper than you can get them anywhere other than a &amp;#34;club&amp;#34; store or a Marine Corp Recruit Depot PX</li>
            <li> but I have never had a closer shave with any other product.</li>
            <li> I bought these due to the price point, but Gillette blades are fungible no matter where you buy them.</li>
            <li> I do not experience nicks or cuts on my face due to shaving anymore.  </li>
            <li> I use to use all other sorts of creams and aftershave to help reduce bumps after shaving and realized it was my razor.</li>
            <li> Even the first shave from these cartridges is uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> Cheaper than any other place I have found.  </li>
            <li> They are sharp and work well</li>
            <li> Yes there are other blades out there, but they cut, scrape, nick and make you bleed.  </li>
            <li> The blade is sharp and gives a close shave.</li>
            <li> It is partly due to the quality of these blades.</li>
            <li> I never have those stray hairs that I&#x27;ve seen on other people.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Has a trimmer blade on the other end</li>
            <li> The price is comparable to other replaceable cartridges</li>
            <li> Similar to my usual brand.</li>
            <li> but they don&#x27;t hold their sharp edge like other blades I use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a close a shave with any other product.</li>
            <li> if you soak the in Alcohol after shave it keeps them sharp</li>
            <li> beat any other name brand out</li>
            <li> The only problem was that when I actually finally tried to use one, I found out they were VERY dull...  </li>
            <li> But the powered one is very rough and will give you a lot of bumps on your chin</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t shave that much so the stupid price of these blades doesn&#x27;t bug me as much as it could.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Less drag and no nicks with the Gillette.</li>
            <li> Probably due to all the people not shaving and profits being down.</li>
            <li> but i guess it was not right decision.  </li>
            <li> This cuts a little rough but still manageable.</li>
            <li> Shaving a tough beard and sensitive skin can be a problem.</li>
            <li> I have found that by using this type of blade compared to other cheaper versions, I have had significantly less razor burn and cuts.  </li>
            <li> Other brands do the job as well for half the price.</li>
            <li> I brought a bulk set last time, and they seemed dull and like they were tugging while i shaved.  </li>
            <li> I have to wait at least 2-3 days between shaving, especially my upper legs.  </li>
            <li> The blades used to last through at least 20 shaves.</li>
            <li> Now I can use the blade I prefer without feeling so guilty for spending so much on razor blades.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s no secret razor blade cartridges are outrageously expensive.</li>
            <li> Like others have said, the cartridges are way too expensive and wear out much faster than they should.</li>
            <li> Maybe this is obvious to people (duh, girl</li>
            <li> The cost factored in with the average performance means that I wouldn&#x27;t be buying this product.</li>
            <li> For the price, they are a complete rip-off.  </li>
            <li> so you come out the same, at least fiscally because you have to replace them less.</li>
            <li> I wish they would get the price down on them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking the quality control has gone down.</li>
            <li> So, I signed up for Amazon&#x27;s monthly shipments to get the price down some and that helps.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bonus is the packaging, which cuts down on cost.</li>
            <li> These blades were dull/uneven as if they were sitting around the warehouse breaking down, but that&#x27;s just conjecture.</li>
            <li> The glide strip helps cut down on any friction.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> I rarely if ever use the single bad on the flip side.</li>
            <li> I hate paying for razor blades, but if I&#x27;m gonna hate paying for something, it&#x27;s a pretty good deal to pay for these.</li>
            <li> These razors are entirely too much money to be this bad.</li>
            <li> just make them cost less</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather see less fancy packages</li>
            <li> Saves money, even less than Costco prices.</li>
            <li> Now, I found this 12 blades for less.</li>
            <li> Serious multiple use razor.</li>
            <li> Therefore, pay $5+ per cartridge opposed to $1 or less for a disposal razor</li>
            <li> That is when I have cut myself with previous razors.</li>
            <li> They actually end up being less expensive because they last a lot longer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many types of razor blades, but I always come back to Gillette despite their outrageous prices.  </li>
            <li> If I could  rate this product less than one star I would.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product before and have purchased it from Amazon previously.  </li>
            <li> I typically do it now when it&#x27;s time to change the cartridge</li>
            <li> For a newbie it will take around a half hour (the time will reduce once you get used to using this style of shaving).  </li>
            <li> All four blades are super-sharp, all the way till the end, and they&#x27;ve typically lasted me about 10</li>
            <li> Typically, when I use a razor, my neck explodes into a rashy, bumpy mess.</li>
            <li> This is definitely not true for us.</li>
            <li> eye brows (not a full on unibrow).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Box does not shut tight</li>
            <li> I notice less pull with the provide blades than the other  brands I&#x27;ve bought in the past.</li>
            <li> either five shaves or as little as three before it starts jerking your whiskers out and leaving me with razor burn.</li>
            <li> I thought we were saving a little money by purchasing these through Amazon.  </li>
            <li> They lasted a little longer...</li>
            <li> These are those little pads used to swab an area of skin (for example if you have to give yourself insulin injections.)  </li>
            <li> My facial hair is a little tough</li>
            <li> Not very pleased with the item and would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t hurt the wallet quite as bad that way, and now I get to use a fresh blades for a while to shave with.</li>
            <li> The mineral oil is missing in the strip.</li>
            <li> buying and suscribing here, I saw the blades a few bucks cheaper in a store around the corner.</li>
            <li> I wasted my money on that.</li>
            <li> I purchase these every few months with subscribe and save.  </li>
            <li> get the job done without being too harsh on his skin.</li>
            <li> I can get a few uses out of each cartridge.</li>
            <li> a Gillette Fusion product - it feels like you&#x27;re shaving with the round side of a plastic knife - smooooooooth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using these blades for a few years now.</li>
            <li> Subsequent shaves are much worse.  </li>
            <li> Have a few wishes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish</li>
            <li> I thought they would be extra strong/close because they are men&#x27;s razors, but they ended up just irritating my skin.</li>
            <li> Uses them until they are totally dead.</li>
            <li> so I save a few bucks.  </li>
            <li> then you will probably need in a few years time</li>
            <li> but I found a pack from a few years ago in a travel bag.</li>
            <li> Im an everyday shaver</li>
            <li> A few of my blades seemed bent or misshaped and cut me often.  </li>
            <li> has the green strip for irritation and wears out</li>
            <li> idea gillette ever made  bet they do not use that firm any longer</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not cheaper if I use once, or less, and toss them!</li>
            <li> One less worry and no more complaints.</li>
            <li> Not sure how this compares to buying at the store, but it&#x27;s one less thing on my shopping list.</li>
            <li> They are just plain fakes.  </li>
            <li> As a novice, i&#x27;ve tried different blades and shavers, but was not quick to get to Gillette Fusion due to a number of angry negative reviews.  </li>
            <li> When I Purchased my 1st 4-Pack at the local CVS Drug Store &amp; paying about $20.00 for it, I 1st thought this was rather expensive, but when I really thought about it, I realized this was actually less expensive than buying those cheaper disposable blades!  </li>
            <li> Now that I can order them online, I won&#x27;t have to mess with the store frustration again!</li>
            <li> Several dollars less expensive than BJ&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> Being in the military we have to shave often, and being black, I get razor bumps (our hair is curly and when you cut it, it regrows under the skin causes irritating bumps also visibly unsightly)</li>
            <li> At first I thought it was one bad egg, but they were all like that.</li>
            <li> I will try this pack and hate the idea of paying full price.  </li>
            <li> only reason it didn&#x27;t get 5 stars is I&#x27;m a guy that doesn&#x27;t shave everyday and when I went to shave after 3 days it performed like any other razor in the fact that it would rip the hair out instead of cutting it.</li>
            <li> I only gave Four stars because they are too expensive in my humble opinion.</li>
            <li> so it ends up being less expensive to use over the long term.</li>
            <li> Certainly not authentic Gillette.</li>
            <li> A 4 pack of the blades is 16 dollars at Walmart which is usually the cheapest place for blades .</li>
            <li> These are the usual Gillete Fusion blades.</li>
            <li> I am not sure what it is, but these blades seem to wear out faster than the ones I buy from grocery stores.</li>
            <li> NO, ok, get a fusion.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, that one had the same problem.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Same as the expensive ones.</li>
            <li> Love these razors... hate the price!  </li>
            <li> In my opinion there are no better blades.</li>
            <li> Never happens with usual Fusion blades.</li>
            <li> I usually follow a close shave with a wash with my salicylic acid face wash to discourage razorburn acne.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I will do the replenishment plan,</li>
            <li> Not sure if these are rejected or returned Gillette baldes, which are re-sold</li>
            <li> /&gt;There&#x27;s not much more to say about these.</li>
            <li> Not much more you can ask for</li>
            <li> I usually use each cartridge for 7 days.</li>
            <li> But until now, I was never completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> No more razor burn.  </li>
            <li> They are too expensive and they don&#x27;t last</li>
            <li> Then--gently wipe a small alcohol \\&quot;prep pad\\&quot; on the blades.</li>
            <li> Initially I thought this might be overkill, but boy was I wrong.</li>
            <li> , I think those are a thing of the past.</li>
            <li> Usually order from Sams Club</li>
            <li> There is definitely something wrong with these razors.  </li>
            <li> that green strip doesn&#x27;t really mean anything at all, you can put on whatever aftershave or lotion on your face when that wears out, and you are not Chuck Norris, your hair doesn&#x27;t damage the blades</li>
            <li> which is saying a lot because I have one very heavy beard.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This has been my default razor for a few years now, but it does tend to leave a little bit of stubble behind.  </li>
            <li> The razors do not seem as sharp as they should, they seem to be after market, or poor quality imitations.</li>
            <li> but the blades only last for about 2 shaves and then they are worthless.</li>
            <li> The downside to a closer, less irritating shave is, of course, the premium price.  </li>
            <li> you have tough beard, this will return a little bit of tenderness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The shave cannot leave spotty stubble, and the blade can&#x27;t dull after 2-3 attempts either.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are dull and scratch the skin...</li>
            <li> In fact, I think the Proglide blades tend to dull faster.</li>
            <li> A dull razor is a dull razor regardless of brand.</li>
            <li> I thought maybe one out of my box of 12 might have been dull, so I tried another razor.  </li>
            <li> had coupon so price was hard to beat</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s hard to beat for a multi-use disposable razor.</li>
            <li> These must have been defects,  they are dull after one use.  </li>
            <li> In fact, I think the Proglide blades tend to dull faster.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s hard to use others after using these.  </li>
            <li> I am hairy and it is hard to get close shaves.</li>
            <li> After one shave, the blade is dull and gives me razor burn.  </li>
            <li> They basically came dull.</li>
            <li> I go through a blade a week at least.</li>
            <li> Shame on me to be that naive</li>
            <li> They cause the least amount of pain, and get the closest shave out of anything I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Sadly I didn&#x27;t realize until after the return window closed.</li>
            <li> and I am slow to change.</li>
            <li> Shaving every day, you are introduced slowly to the dulling of a blade.</li>
            <li> No more worrying at night!</li>
            <li> And I don&#x27;t mean a year of shaving my face.</li>
            <li> I mean it makes sense,</li>
            <li> NO more hairy legs in this house!  </li>
            <li> Not sure why some people had bad experiences and gave 1 star ratings; the ones I got are definitely legitimate.</li>
            <li> I hate that the cost is so high.  </li>
            <li> These razors are seriously the best-for males and for females-there is no better razor!</li>
            <li> Dull blades on this aren&#x27;t actually that bad using.</li>
            <li> but I wish these were less expensive.</li>
            <li> And why switch to the less expensive 3-blade alte Gillette when one has three Fusion handles.</li>
            <li> Less expensive blades suck after you have used this arrangement.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t have anything bad to say!</li>
            <li> Maybe a little too expensive for my taste.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve tried 6 of the 12 razors and they all are no good.</li>
            <li> I hate getting the big boxes and have to cut them open with concern of cutting myself.</li>
            <li> but wow talk about going from luxury to crap.</li>
            <li> Also, these blades are sharp but their design prevents me from cutting myself.</li>
            <li> And, yep, don&#x27;t press to hard!</li>
            <li> CRAZY expensive for only 12 razors.</li>
            <li> I think I must have a particularly tough beard because I&#x27;ve asked others who use the blades</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s tough find these.</li>
            <li> I have a tough beard.  </li>
            <li> No more, &#x27;I&#x27;m out of razors!!&#x27;</li>
            <li> Bought these after browsing Costco, and these were less expensive!</li>
            <li> Razors are expensive but this blade works well for my thick beard.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Other blades can cut too, of course, but this razor&#x27;s series of blades will make it quite a bit worse.</li>
            <li> It has happened to me three times and it is frustrating.</li>
            <li> Absolute worst razors ever.  </li>
            <li> Not happy at all.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s just not great.</li>
            <li> was not happy with the quality</li>
            <li> But it doesn&#x27;t make the razor worse.</li>
            <li> My husband is addicted to these blades.  </li>
            <li> They are just plain fake!</li>
            <li> I usually use 1 razor a month, and use them until they start cutting my face.  </li>
            <li> I generally don&#x27;t leave poor reviews, but I am Very Disappointed with this experience, and wanted to warn others.  </li>
            <li> I got tired of shopping for expensive blades every month.</li>
            <li> Generally, that computes to about $1 per day for shaving (which is kinda insane, considering you can probably pay someone to give you a shave for $5 in parts of the US.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here</li>
            <li> and this last batch is terrible</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this price for a 12 pack .</li>
            <li> (insert expletives) expensive.  </li>
            <li> They are expensive and your struggle with justifying the cost each time.</li>
            <li> that were uncomfortable and a hassle with the tissues or astringents to close the wounds.</li>
            <li> So for me, they are expensive because at $4/cartridge, 1 cartridge/week, I&#x27;m racking up costs.</li>
            <li> Expensive</li>
            <li> After reading some of the reviews that these blades were an off-Brand, I was skeptical.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve always looked lousy with a mustache and/or beard.)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d be wary of buying these bulk razors from Amazon...</li>
            <li> These are absolutely fake or &amp;#34;irregular&amp;#34; and discarded by Gillette.  </li>
            <li> Removed - Prime movie review that mistakenly got placed into a product instead of a lousy Prime Series Pilot called After</li>
            <li> too expensive but works.&lt;br /&gt;Need</li>
            <li> Buy it, you can&#x27;t go wrong.  </li>
            <li> You can practically be careless and not hurt yourself.</li>
            <li> Expensive.</li>
            <li> Precision Trimmer is defiantly useless for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an expensive treat for your face.</li>
            <li> 4 stars because I think the blades are too expensive.</li>
            <li> Too expensive.</li>
            <li> Sorry Costco stopped selling these supeb 5-blade refills.</li>
            <li> too expensive.  </li>
            <li> &quot; fake,</li>
            <li> I think something is wrong here</li>
            <li> Bought the wrong ones because they looked like what I wanted, but the picture of the package was deceiving.</li>
            <li> As always,too expensive</li>
            <li> Just wish they were not so expensive but they are cheaper than WalMart</li>
            <li> Why are they so expensive.</li>
            <li> Expensive for what one gets in return.</li>
            <li> Too expensive.  </li>
            <li> This razor is the biggest secret!</li>
            <li> They are so expensive to buy in the stores.</li>
            <li> But I must have read the description wrong as I thought I was getting the Fusion Pro-Glide blades.  </li>
            <li> i just wish the blades werent so expensive.</li>
            <li> Would give five stars but the razor heads are slightly expensive.</li>
            <li> Very poor experience....</li>
            <li> By the time I realized how dull and terrible these were it was too late.  </li>
            <li> These are so bad that I think they might be bootlegged or falsely labeled.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, these razors are very expensive, and I have looked into Dollar Shave Club as an alternative.</li>
            <li> Men and women users of Gillette Fusion, Mach 3, &amp; Sensor blades/shaving systems, the price you pay for these products is outrageous and not worth the money you paid for them.  </li>
            <li> I find this unacceptable and dangerous.</li>
            <li> Gillette has created another \\&quot;cutting edge\\&quot; product with these cartridges.  </li>
            <li> and there is no hassle cutting them open.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wrong! ...</li>
            <li> man are these blades expensive!</li>
            <li> Not sure where these blades came from, but they are horrible.</li>
            <li> fake!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m stuck buying them for my men but the prices make me mad</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are just so friggin&#x27; EXPENSIVE!</li>
            <li> I used to get crazy bad razor burn.  </li>
            <li> These refills are very expensive at retail stores.</li>
            <li> Too bad, I&#x27;ve been using these for over a decade.</li>
            <li> My husband cut himself badly while shaving with these.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t determine whether I just got a bad batch, and it took me beyond the return window to realize the issue.</li>
            <li> Te bad side is that it disappointed me.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve never been disappointed.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> so why is it that the refills are so expensive?!?!</li>
            <li> I even hate to use another brand or razor because I am so used to the comfort of this design.</li>
            <li> So I hate being razors.</li>
            <li> I hate shopping at the brick &amp; mortar discount stores.</li>
            <li> i hate buying razors because of the cost.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not like they&#x27;re going to go bad before you use them!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed in these.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> Horrible quality.</li>
            <li> some of the replacement blades you get on the internet are of terrible quality.  </li>
            <li> These razors are Crap!</li>
            <li> Worst razors I&#x27;ve ever purchased.</li>
            <li> Seems whenever I use these I get terrible razor burn.</li>
            <li> but I got a nasty cut when I shaved my legs with one.  </li>
            <li> The price is downright INSANE!</li>
            <li> These were the worst razors I ever bought.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands in the past and Gillette is by far my favorite. At this point I am using Mach3 blades and Fusion Blades. Fusion blades last a bit longer for some reason. no rash or scratches after shaving.&lt;br /&gt;Also the package was shipped and delivered very fast.</li>
            <li> Gillette Fusion Manual Razor Blade Refills are the only product available that comfortably removes the heavy beard growth of my son.  But even they dull fairly fast and having an option to buy in quantity is appreciated price-wise.</li>
            <li> The razors don&#x27;t last for 10 shaves. Yes they start out giving a great shave but at $4 a cartridge I expect a little more.</li>
            <li> Nice product and fair price</li>
            <li> Great Blades at a good price, would signing up for the auto delivery which reduces the price a bit too. Razors are expensive but this blade works well for my thick beard.</li>
            <li> Always gives Amazing Shaving Experience</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really a no brainer to have the razor blades delivered as a reoccurring order.  It&#x27;s very convenient, somewhat economical, and always there when you need them.</li>
            <li> Hubby&#x27;s favorite blades! He won&#x27;t settle for anything else.</li>
            <li> Great razor -  best price I&#x27;ve seen on the refills.</li>
            <li> blades in the store are much more expensive not that this is cheap but better</li>
            <li> Great shave and great price.</li>
            <li> Certainly not authentic Gillette. You will notice once you realize you are using twice your regular usage. Horrible quality.</li>
            <li> Great quality blades and way cheaper than in any store. I go through a blade a week at least. I have a rough beard. These blades work perfectly and never nick me.</li>
            <li> good value - great product, don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be buying another brand</li>
            <li> I have been buying these for a while and this last batch is terrible--it makes me wonder if they are not made by Gillette or whether the manufacturer is mixing in what would be rejected in the regular retail packaging. I have been shaving with these for as long as they have been out and never run into this problem with what I buy at the drug store (except the price is stupidly high). A cut up face or a happier wallet? Answer: it&#x27;s not cheaper if I use once, or less, and toss them!</li>
            <li> Product as described.</li>
            <li> I have used these blades for a long time, and have never had any problems. I have found buying them in bulk on amazon to get me the best prices available.</li>
            <li> Gillette Fusion Cartridges shave like they are used and not new&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried several of these from a 24 count purchase and they all feel like just before I toss them for a new one, like they have been used??</li>
            <li> great seller, highly recommended!</li>
            <li> My husband has alwasy liked Gillette Fushion and when I found this on Amazon.com and saw the price, I had to order!</li>
            <li> these are great razors and better price than buying them at the store.  the 12 count will last awhile in our house.</li>
            <li> THE BLADE DOES NOT GIVE A  CLEAN SHAVE. AFTER SHAVING MY BEARD FEELS AS THOUGH I DIDN&#x27;T SHAVE AT ALL!</li>
            <li> I shave my head - so a clean, heavy-duty blade is a must. The shave cannot leave spotty stubble, and the blade can&#x27;t dull after 2-3 attempts either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These Fusions are the best blades I&#x27;ve used for the task. I often go more than a month with the same blade, with no noticeable extra effort needed on head or face. The shave is clean and usually just a few passes with the blade will do the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even with a week&#x27;s growth on the head, the blade is up to it (granted, I&#x27;m pretty bald, so we&#x27;re not talking a full head of full, lustrous hair, here). It might take extra work, but the blade rinses easily and a little extra time is all that&#x27;s needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one flaw is not the blade&#x27;s fault - but it&#x27;s still something to be aware of - if you screw up with these blades, especially if you&#x27;re using them for headshaving, your mistake will not be painlessly forgiven.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve cut myself quite a few times, usually on the fingers when I&#x27;m switching hands, or other accidents - and the multiple blades guarantee more than a nick. It will flay the skin along several lines, and it can be pretty deep, and it will bleed a lot. It can be the kind of cut you&#x27;ll actually need to pay attention too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other blades can cut too, of course, but this razor&#x27;s series of blades will make it quite a bit worse. If it was just my face, I probably wouldn&#x27;t make the mistake, but since I&#x27;m shaving my head I can&#x27;t always see what I&#x27;m doing, and that can be the problem. I&#x27;ve never cut my head - only my fingers and rarely, face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is not the blade&#x27;s fault - it&#x27;s mine! But I can&#x27;t imagine I&#x27;m the only one whose done this. I know we&#x27;re all careful with blades, but this one deserves a bit of extra care and attention - it will not forgive any carelessness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But - the blade itself is a rare product that works maybe better than advertised. If you need a clean shave for thick stubble, this should work for you.</li>
            <li> These are the real Gillette Fusion blades. They are not the Gillete that I found also.</li>
            <li> No problems.  It&#x27;s nice not running out of razor blades.</li>
            <li> They work very well in my new power swivel razor, even though I accidentally bought the non-power blades. Gillette does all this marketing stuff and it all gets more confusing than helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t show where made.</li>
            <li> The best razors for the money - good shave and multiple uses. Good price using on-line coupon.</li>
            <li> cheaper than store!  saved $8 at time I ordered, work fine!  :)</li>
            <li> I wish I would have read the reviews before I ordered these blades, these are definitely sub-standard blades, not sure why, they look genuine and I trust that Amazon sells only genuine items like this, they are very dull and hurt to shave, definitely can&#x27;t use these, guess I will just pay the store price.</li>
            <li> Still have them. Works great and saved me a lot of money.</li>
            <li> I was going through anxiety issues over my razor blade shortage before ordering this. No more worrying at night!</li>
            <li> Razor are razor to me but my husband says that these for some reason last longer. And a happy husband gets a happy wife</li>
            <li> These blades came in brand new packaging, and looked great upon arrival.  The only problem was that when I actually finally tried to use one, I found out they were VERY dull...  Felt like I was going to tear my skin off with them!  I tried 3 different blades from this shipment (one from each sleeve), and they were all the same.  I bought these in bulk to save a bit of money.  I already had a couple other blades left from a purchase I made at a local store prior to ordering these, so did not have to use these for over a month after I ordered them.  When I did realize that they were defective, I tried to simply exchange them, but was told that I could no longer do so, as it had already been more than 30 days after my purchase.  I generally don&#x27;t leave poor reviews, but I am Very Disappointed with this experience, and wanted to warn others.  Wish this matter could&#x27;ve been resolved another way.</li>
            <li> They came delivered as expected. Saved 10 cents off Target price. :)</li>
            <li> A 4 pack of the blades is 16 dollars at Walmart which is usually the cheapest place for blades . You can&#x27;t go wrong with this price for a 12 pack .</li>
            <li> Great way to re-order the correct razors! I have been to the local store many times and they have you take a card from the shaving area to the cashier (instead of the actual razors). They then go into the back room and come out saying they can&#x27;t find the correct razors. It has happened to me three times and it is frustrating. Now that I can order them online, I won&#x27;t have to mess with the store frustration again!</li>
            <li> These blades last a long time use them 4 my face and head! Happy customer  fast shipping decent price......</li>
            <li> Just as I expected. Great quality and superb service! Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Good price and product</li>
            <li> some of the replacement blades you get on the internet are of terrible quality.  these works like they are supposed to. I couldn&#x27;t feel any different than the much higher priced blades that I buy in the big box stores.</li>
            <li> Super awesome price for the same thing you buy at the store. Definitly will buy more. I haven&#x27;t found a better blade out there to shave with. Keep up the good job guys. Great product and at a super great price.</li>
            <li> Genuine Gillette Fusion Razor Blade Refills, just like the real thing, because they are the real thing. I usually get a month out of my blades, so this 12 pack should last me about a year.</li>
            <li> Purchased these with the subscribe and save and looks like a good deal so far. .. we love these razors</li>
            <li> These are the usual Gillete Fusion blades. With my sensitive skin, these 5 bladed things are a must!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price, even at Costco!!</li>
            <li> The price of these has gone waaaay up but the quality is still there.</li>
            <li> did not like-blades were not sharp</li>
            <li> I shave every day and I&#x27;m getting three weeks out of each blade. They work well for me.</li>
            <li> Great Blades. I get about a month out of each one, shaving once per day.</li>
            <li> This is not the same quality i buy from the store, somehow it looks differrent in packing.  i tried to save some money but i guess it was not right decision.  i should not recomend to buy online</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the Gillette fusion manual men&#x27;s razor blade. As a retired Marine I have kept myself closely shaved for pretty much all my adult life. I also shave my head and the Gillette fusion is the one of the best blades I&#x27;ve ever used and it gives me a good close shave and is extremely comfortable. I usually get a week or longer use from each blade and the comfort remains the same. I would recommend this product to any man who uses a blade to shave.</li>
            <li> The razor blades were received extremely fast from vendor. The blades arrived in original packaging. I would order again from this vendor.</li>
            <li> Scrapes large amounts of thick hair effectively without letting enough blood to send me to the ER.</li>
            <li> Last year I got a  gift of Gillette razor and two 5-blade cartridges. They were superb in performance gliding easy on my skin. They lasted for almost 12 months; yes, one full year. Encouraged from this experience I ordered these cartridges[ASIN:B004B8AZH0 Gillette Fusion Manual Cartridges, 12-Count] from Amazon. In fact, I subscribed to receive a supply every six months. These new blades do not shave the way the ealier ones did. There is no comparison. These ones do not glide smoothly, I need to pull the razor and it makes scraping sound! As if I am sharpening a razor on a leather belt! The quality of shave is not at all close and clean and it irritates the skin. I was so much impressed with earlier Gillette experience that I did not contact Amazon immediately and kept trying different blades.... even after 3 or 4 different cartridges still no luck.The mineral oil is missing in the strip. Very poor experience....and I have now decided to return the unused cattridges and cancel my subsciption for future supply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update : 01/04/2012&lt;br /&gt;My earlier experience was with Fusion Proglide! And, this review covers Fusion. There is noticeable difference in experience from Fusion and Fusion proglide. I can not understand why Gillette should have very similar nomneclature for two different products which led to this confusion. My repeat experience with Fusion Proglide blades is excellent.</li>
            <li> Love these razors, don&#x27;t be concerned they are the real thing!</li>
            <li> I have SUPER sensitive skin.  I can&#x27;t shave every day or I get a rash.  I have to wait at least 2-3 days between shaving, especially my upper legs.  This is basically the only razor that doesn&#x27;t cause a rash, or stinging pain, or cut me.  I wish it wasn&#x27;t so (insert expletives) expensive.  I&#x27;m sure this necessity for shaving sensitive skin is completely cost prohibitive for many and really Gillette, you&#x27;re an American brand of the people...these razors shouldn&#x27;t be for the 1%.  You&#x27;re not a prescription drug company...just make them cost less and maybe you&#x27;ll even sell more and have fewer on the black market (hello eBay, Craigslist and flea markets!).  We know you&#x27;re only charging so much because you can.  And that makes us resent your brand.  As soon as we find a cheaper alternative we&#x27;re bouncing.  (Should I turn this review into a proper petition?)</li>
            <li> keep the price low!  Force Gillette to play ball and not raise the price for 5 years!  I&#x27;d rather see less fancy packages</li>
            <li> Best price you can find on the internet.  Blades seem to work just as good as when you get them in the store.</li>
            <li> Being a long time Gillette razor user, I&#x27;ve come to find out that blades can last either five shaves or as little as three before it starts jerking your whiskers out and leaving me with razor burn. All I can suggest is find a better blade and try using a Schick Titanium blade. I&#x27;ve had as many as 50 shaves from one blade or as little as 30 shaves which is saying a lot because I have one very heavy beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gillette; do your homework and come back with a better bullet the put in my razor or get out of the business!</li>
            <li> I am not sure what it is, but these blades seem to wear out faster than the ones I buy from grocery stores. I thought I&#x27;d get some genuinely good blades since they were in these &#x27;factory packs&#x27;, but I guess they are not. I will going back to buying from the store and when someone does come with a better blade, I will drop Gilette altogether</li>
            <li> These are the best razors for my sensitive skin.  They give the smoothest shave after just one pass in each direction.  I am able to get three uses out of each one.  The price is high, but I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different brands and types and these are still my favorite.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my fiance. He told me he used one and it cut him up as he shaved. He thought maybe it was just a fluke so he replaced the first blade with a 2nd new blade. That one cut him up, too. Want to return them please?</li>
            <li> Of course it works great but very costly.</li>
            <li> oh boy...razor cartridges.</li>
            <li> Awesome and as expected! I have always enjoyed this line of razors, and being able to buy in bulk like this was way cheaper than buying at local grocery store.</li>
            <li> Great quality, these are the only blades my husband will use. Also a very good value, better than in-store pricing.</li>
            <li> I bought a 12-pack of these before moving overseas for a year.  There&#x27;s not much to say really, they worked fine and lasted a long time.</li>
            <li> Me and my husband use this brand. Ther long lasting and a close shave weather it&#x27;s legs or beard.</li>
            <li> I thought we were saving a little money by purchasing these through Amazon.  Didn&#x27;t realize I only had 30 days to return.  By the time I realized how dull and terrible these were it was too late.  I would NEVER purchase these from Amazon again.  Absolute worst razors ever.  99 cent store razors would be sharper.  These must be imitation or low grade steel.  Buyer Beware!</li>
            <li> They came in a package that was not sealed. I find this unacceptable and dangerous. I am not even going to try them</li>
            <li> My husband has a rough time shaving because his beard re-growth is coarse and white.  These blades do the job all blades are suppose to do.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend them to everyone!</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B004B8AZH0 Gillette Fusion Manual Cartridges, 12-Count]]The blades are new and the price is excellent. I am happy to be able to purchase these blades as  they are really good on my face and beard.</li>
            <li> i am new to manual shaving, having switched from electric shaving about a year ago.  As a novice, i&#x27;ve tried different blades and shavers, but was not quick to get to Gillette Fusion due to a number of angry negative reviews.  Many of them pointed out a relatively high price of these blades.  Well, after a couple of months using them i can say that the blades are super sharp, leaving my face feel absolutely smooth, while never cutting me, unlike some other blades.  I say - give them a try and see for yourself.  As for me, i signed up for a regular once every four months delivery.</li>
            <li> These razors arrived on time and the price was great</li>
            <li> good quality product is what I expected for that price</li>
            <li> When it came to shaving I always used to avoid products that came with bells and whistles; thinking that these are just another marketing/sales gimmick... You think for shaving \\&quot;all you need is a blade and a shaving cream\\&quot;, Right?... Wrong! ... I&#x27;m glad my wife convinced me to use these Gillette Fusion blades. They are just amazing! No cuts, smooth shaving and they actually last longer than the normal 2 blade cartridges. I have been using them now for almost a year and I&#x27;m really happy with the product.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Gillette, the best a man can get.&amp;#34; I used to really believe that when I was 18. I thought that when I grew up it would be my destiny to shave for eternity in front of cameras and eternal mirrors. This didn&#x27;t happen to me and providence called me to other shores, for instance I started a hamburger stand called Hamburglers but was put out of business by a lawsuit from McDonald&#x27;s who own the rights to the character Hamburglar (my guy was Hamburgler and was dressed in lederhosen and rugby shorts -- didn&#x27;t look anything like the McDonald&#x27;s guy, but still they took me to court and I lost everything). I used an electric or perhaps electronic razor from age 18 to about 30 when my beard, in response to the McDonald&#x27;s tragedy grew more cynical and rough and I needed to start shaving using a razor. I used the Gillette Mach III for many years and when Canary Toopard passed (my pet gorilla) I decided to celebrate (he came to control and torture me for many years at the end) by upgrading to the Fusion. I shall finish by saying that my face is smooth as when I was born and still believed in the magic and power of shaving that inevitably lay ahead of me.</li>
            <li> This deal rivals Costco and BJ&#x27;s.  I&#x27;m happy with it and the Razor works significantly better than many other cheaper razors out there.</li>
            <li> Great why to buy blades for the year.</li>
            <li> Really love the quality of this razors. Ordered about a month ago and still using only the first one out of whole box - 12 count. I do shave twice a week and my hair is not a soft ones. So basically this box can be enough for one year. Recommend to any one who needs it.</li>
            <li> Besides the cost the shave is incredible.</li>
            <li> Super value. Great razor blades</li>
            <li> Best razor ever. Better than women&#x27;s razors with no cuts ever!</li>
            <li> Have been using this style razor for a while and would not know what to use to replace it. Ordered a well priced replacement blade package that was delivered on time in excelent condition.</li>
            <li> This has all of those blades yes, does yours have the one on the other side? NO, ok, get a fusion. most versatile manual cartridge.</li>
            <li> Cheapest price I have found so far...</li>
            <li> I am a female and have always used men&#x27;s razors as I feel they get a closer shave. I have used these for years and they are my favorite. I noticed Amazon does not sell a 12 count Gillette Fusion Power pack, so I tried these Manuals and they work. I also began spraying them with Clean Shower as another reviewer suggested, they last much longer!</li>
            <li> good value and best blade out there.</li>
            <li> Gillette has created another \\&quot;cutting edge\\&quot; product with these cartridges.  Talk about a \\&quot;close shave!\\&quot;  They don&#x27;t get much closer than this!</li>
            <li> harry&#x27;s blades (www.harrys.com) are much cheaper, better and last longer.</li>
            <li> I was nervous buying this because I thought that maybe I was not getting the real deal with this.  I was encouraged knowing that with Amazon this would not of been a problem so I went ahead and ordered (since I knew I could return easily with Amazon).  I got my razors and they work great.  I have used the same razor for 3 weeks now and still do not need to replace the blade.  They do not fall apart like someone else mentioned.  They do not go dull very fast either; I shave at least 5 times a week and still am using the first blade after 3 weeks.  I recommend this to anyone who is trying to get the best deal for blades.  Feel free to ignore the other reviews that say this product is fake or defective... I agree with another reviewer who said that they believed those reviews to be miss leading.</li>
            <li> There is nothing to say.  They are a razor blade.  That is what the do.  My husband shaves with them.</li>
            <li> These razors are entirely too much money to be this bad. They are dull and scratch the skin... all of them did. The Mach III&#x27;s I got from Costco were way better. Not going to buy these again.</li>
            <li> Buying new blades for your razor is never a pleasant experience. They are expensive and your struggle with justifying the cost each time. However, I will say that Amazon has once again come to the rescue with the price of the Gillette Fusion blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These blades are about 20% cheaper on Amazon.com than they are in any other store near me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the product, these blades give you a great shave. I can usually get through about 3 weeks before needing a new blade. I have found that cleaning the blade with HOT water after each shave lengthens the time between needing a replacement. The shave with this blade is very close. The first time you use with, you will feel it gently glide against your skin. I have yet to receive a cut with using this blade. Of course, just be careful when using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Amazon has the best price anywhere for these blades&lt;br /&gt;- Severely less tug and pull during the first few uses of each blade&lt;br /&gt;- 5 blades makes the process smooth&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Price&lt;br /&gt;- Lotion Strip is pretty meaningless, it does not last very long&lt;br /&gt;- Single blade on the top of the cartridge is useless in my opinion. It&#x27;s too small and not sharp enough to do anything meaningful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4/5 Stars...price the only downside but you will not find it cheaper anywhere else. Amazon has the best price for these blades and I have been using them for years.</li>
            <li> Great value for money. Haven&#x27;t found anywhere that comes close for cost.</li>
            <li> I have used most of the Gillete series of razors going back to the Sensor. I have found the Fusion blades to be the best of the bunch. I have tried the newer Proglide Fusion blades, but personally don&#x27;t think they are worth the extra money. In fact, I think the Proglide blades tend to dull faster. I also opt for the manual blades as I didn&#x27;t notice a difference when using the power blades, which are a bit more expensive. Thanks to Amazon for frustration free (and less) packaging!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping recied exactl what i wanted.</li>
            <li> they keep coming out with newer blades that are just more and more expensive.  but these are good blades (per my husband) and a better price than the store.</li>
            <li> A good shave.  Saves money, even less than Costco prices.</li>
            <li> The Gillette fusion has been the best blades ever. Now, I found this 12 blades for less. Great deal at the best price. Thanks AMAZON for these deals.</li>
            <li> Love the fact that buying in bulk saves a ton of money.</li>
            <li> the product was as described and was received as promised in excellant shape, i would use this supplier again and recomend them</li>
            <li> This are the best of best sir! Lol all kidding aside these are real Gillette razor blade cartridges that will fit a variety of their brand of handles. The first one I popped in worked great, such a smooth close save. I almost got carded when trying to buy some drinks at a gas station.</li>
            <li> Not happy at all. Not sharp enough. Expected better.</li>
            <li> God price for extremely overpriced razors.</li>
            <li> My favorite razor blades, but they seem to get dull faster than before.  The trimming razor on the backside is nice to have.  Far better than the generic knock-offs, but these are definitely pricey!</li>
            <li> Great price for these blades</li>
            <li> I get these every 2 months. Delivered on the same day and in great shape. I got tired of shopping for expensive blades every month. Subscribe and save is easy and a good value. I save tons of gas.</li>
            <li> Works well, very happy!!</li>
            <li> Used subscribe and save and now I always have razors.  Much cheaper this way than at the store in town.</li>
            <li> Love them. Love them Love them. That is all ! They go on sale alot to. Wait for the discounts and you will always be happy !</li>
            <li> Good blades but a racket at the price they cost.  I can&#x27;t believe there isn&#x27;t a cheaper alternative.</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Fusion blades for I don&#x27;t know how long--10 years? I used to use double-edged blades and frequently had razor burn, cuts, scrapes, etc. that were uncomfortable and a hassle with the tissues or astringents to close the wounds. Because of that I moved to an electric which solved that problem but were never as close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter actually saw them in a Costco and innocently asked me why I don&#x27;t use them, so I tried them. From the very beginning, there were no cuts or irritation at all. Over the many years I&#x27;ve used them nothing has changed--they still perform magnificently. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve *ever* had a cut from the 5-blade side (more on the 1-blade side later).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I were to knock them for anything it&#x27;s two things:&lt;br /&gt;1) I rarely if ever use the single bad on the flip side. In fact, the only times I&#x27;ve had a cut is from accidentally nicking myself with the single blade if I carelessly move the blades near my face. I could do without it though understand why some might like this feature.&lt;br /&gt;2) they blades &amp;#34;out of the box&amp;#34; are fantastic, but on my beard they get dull within days. I have a Van Dyke, so don&#x27;t shave a good portion of my face! I think I must have a particularly tough beard because I&#x27;ve asked others who use the blades and they don&#x27;t have the same issue--the can go many weeks to months on the same blades. I usually go over a week on a blade, but they start getting tougher to push through the beard near the end. So for me, they are expensive because at $4/cartridge, 1 cartridge/week, I&#x27;m racking up costs.I didn&#x27;t ding them for cost because I still love the result so much.</li>
            <li> Something was off--they didn&#x27;t feel as smooth as raisers from the store...</li>
            <li> I am 63 Years Old Male and have been Shaving since I was Sixteen Years Old.  I have used so many different types of Blades until I received a FREE Gillnetter FUSION Razor in the Mail Many Years Ago, when they first came out.  I have an Average Density and Medium Beard Texture, so in my First Experience I really wanted to Test this NEW Blade.  So with taking care of it by softening my beard with just warm water before shaving and then using just plain soap to lubricate my face before shaving, then washing it out with just warm water, I was able to make \\&quot;ONE Blade\\&quot; LAST almost a FULL YEAR! When I Purchased my 1st 4-Pack at the local CVS Drug Store &amp; paying about $20.00 for it, I 1st thought this was rather expensive, but when I really thought about it, I realized this was actually less expensive than buying those cheaper disposable blades!  And then more recently to FIND OUT that \\&quot;Amazon.com\\&quot; DISCOUNTED this Product (3 4-packs for about $30.00, PLUS FREE Shipping) this is about ONE THIRD of a regular Drug or Retail Store&#x27;s Price! WOW  I have NOW Become Not ONLY a \\&quot;Gillette FUSION\\&quot; Addict but an \\&quot;Amazon.com\\&quot; Addict as well!  THANK YOU Gillette!  THANK YOU Amazon.com!  Jerry Barton, Sr., from the South Poconos in PA.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my husband because they are so much cheaper online, and they were exactly what he wanted and in amazon&#x27;s frustration free packaging.  It really is frustration free and if you make sure to order directly from amazon you don&#x27;t have to worry about imitations!</li>
            <li> What an awesome deal. Was literally about to pay more for half as many razors at a store before finding these!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I decided to purchase the 12-count  package thru Amazon.  Even though I used some of my cash-back bonus, the original price wasn&#x27;t that high.  This purchase should last me a full year since I don&#x27;t shave every day.</li>
            <li> Great Blades... love the extra blade on the back... gets all the details needed to make my goat T look spectacular!</li>
            <li> I think these are great razor blades. I wish they would get the price down on them.</li>
            <li> I have used the Gillette Fusion razor since it first came out.  I really like the shave I get and the blades are comfortable and fast to use.  With 5 blades I don&#x27;t have to shave the same spot on my face multiple times, the first stroke gets it done right.  This eliminates razor burn for me and results in a more comfortable shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like how the blade assembly follows my face and provides a good shave by keeping the blades at the right angle and in full contact with my skin.  I also like having the one blade side for trimming my mustache and side burns.  The lubricating strip is a nice feature as it improves the gliding motion of the blade head and also acts like a blade wear indicator.  I get a lot of use out of these blades as they seem to me to last longer than other brands and blade designs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Out of all of the types of razors I have used for many years, there is no comparison to the Gillette Fusion.  I even hate to use another brand or razor because I am so used to the comfort of this design.</li>
            <li> As always, Gillette produces a quality item. The blades offer a smooth, close shave with very little pull.</li>
            <li> Love the razors.. Been using them for three years now. Always smooth results..and the price is unbeatable. You will not find it cheaper anywhere else.</li>
            <li> I pay 17$ with tax for 4 blades. You can&#x27;t beat this price.</li>
            <li> These razors are Crap! I bought them by Mistake since the Package has a Big Advertisement for FUSION PROGLIDE on the Box! I thought these were the PROGLIDE or I never would have bought them!!! They nick you all over and do not last!!!</li>
            <li> great product delivered straight to my door!</li>
            <li> I shave my head and my face daily.  These blades work great.  The only - and real problem - with them?  The ridiculously high price....</li>
            <li> Expensive but What Choice Do You Have. This is simply the best technology razor there is out there that&#x27;s disposable. Serious multiple use razor.</li>
            <li> Annual gift for my grown children.  Good prices always on Amazon and I am able to buy them in bulk!</li>
            <li> Came through as ordered. Interesting packaging. Box does not shut tight but I guess that is OK. The blades are cheaper than in the store but work very well. I have been using them for many years.</li>
            <li> Seem to be the same as those sold in stores as they give me just as many shaves.</li>
            <li> These Gillette Fusion razor cartridges give the best shave of any cartridge on the market that I&#x27;m aware of.  I only gave Four stars because they are too expensive in my humble opinion.</li>
            <li> 3rd time I have bought this item!! So much cheaper than any where else,Costco,,Walmart, Walgreen&#x27;s! Only way to buy razor blades!!</li>
            <li> The fusion 12-pack is just what you&#x27;d get at the store, but somewhat cheaper since it&#x27;s a 12-pack.  If you like the fusion go for it.  Not that this is not the Fusion ProGlide, which are a bit nice, but also a bit more expensive.</li>
            <li> Honestly, the original Fusion blades are better then the newer ProGlides, which are interchangeable on any Fusion handle. The ProGlides just sting more.</li>
            <li> These blades are my husband&#x27;s favorite for shaving.  He ran out so I priced them and found that Amazon had the best deal pricewise so I bought them and now my husband is set for quite a while.  He&#x27;s very happy.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> i think these blades may be genuine, but I&#x27;m guessing they are genuine for regions where Gillette sells lower-grade blades. Nothing like the blades I get in NE US. Kind of like what I got ten years ago. These are probably marketed overseas at a lower cost, which is fine if that&#x27;s what you are use to, but if you are used to the high grade US version, these really kind of suck.</li>
            <li> Typically I&#x27;m skeptical of \\&quot;premium\\&quot; brand names, but I&#x27;ve used mach 3, a few generic razors, and earlier Gillette models, and I have to admit the Gillette Fusion cartridges are the best. Using these blades while sharp I almost never nick myself. My facial hair is a little tough so I used to have trouble getting a clean shave on the first try. With these razors that&#x27;s never been an issue for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Granted, these are the most expensive razors you&#x27;ll typically see in stores. However, the amazon price is great (especially with subscribe &amp; save). Moreover, using tips I saw on another razor review, I can get an individual Gillette razor to last about a month. By rinsing the gunk off with hot water after shaving, spraying the razor with shower cleaner, then propping it against the wall the durability improves dramatically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, if I hadn&#x27;t discovered I could make a single razor last a month I wouldn&#x27;t bother buying these. I think they&#x27;re the best, but they&#x27;re not THAT much better than other razors. A dull razor is a dull razor regardless of brand. Yet, if you can make a razor 12 pack last a year, and they&#x27;re so cheap on Amazon, why not buy the best?</li>
            <li> This has been my default razor for a few years now, but it does tend to leave a little bit of stubble behind.  It&#x27;s not as close as they may advertise and takes a few strokes to get things right.  It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and each razor lasts for a fair amount of time, so it&#x27;s bad, it&#x27;s just not great.</li>
            <li> Great product for a great price. 12 count Gillette Fusion Manual Cartridges will keep your face fuzz free for a long time.</li>
            <li> I used the same Gillette razor blade for about 6 months.  I finally decided it was time to get a new set of razors.  I saw these and thought it was a good deal as it was the cheapest price I could find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I started using my razors, I noticed immediately that I was not getting the close and comfortable shave I had with my older razor.  I thought maybe one out of my box of 12 might have been dull, so I tried another razor.  Unfortunately, that one had the same problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These razors work, but they could be better.  They wear out much faster than I expected and they don&#x27;t give me the close shave I want, but they sell at a decent price.  I think next time, though, I will just accept the $50 price tag and buy them from Costco.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I have been using it ever since it came on to the market. The Amazon price is number one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit that this is the only type I&#x27;ve used so far (yeah, those free mail offerings with a shaver for Gillette got me) so I&#x27;ve just stuck with it so far. The lubricating strips are a joke. Don&#x27;t buy them for that reason because every time I start a new blade, it wears off within the first shave. Dull blades on this aren&#x27;t actually that bad using. I used a dull blade for over a month and it gave me the same results as a new one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really an awesome product from Gillette...Gives me a real clean shave.......What&#x27;s more...The price&#x27;s great at amazon....I highly recommend buying this product from amazon.</li>
            <li> These are definitely solid, but a bit pricy overall. This was the best deal I could find on the 12 count, and this should last me a long time, but I&#x27;m still always a bit baffled by the price. I tend to extend the life of the razors for longer than I probably should. Overall, provides clean shave with few to no nicks. But, I&#x27;ve seen better pricing around for other razors. Not sure there&#x27;s really a difference between the Fusion and other Gilette razors really.</li>
            <li> Great product and price!</li>
            <li> After reading some of the reviews that these blades were an off-Brand, I was skeptical. After product arrived, I was pleasantly surprised that these blades came directly from the manufacturer. The blades perform exactly as expected. With proper care, you can extend the life of the blades. Gillette offers the best blade on the market and the cost via Amazon beats the local store price.</li>
            <li> This product is a great deal for the price! It may be &amp;quot;out-of-the-box&amp;quot; but these replacement blades are brand new.</li>
            <li> All items work great no problems.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed and a much better price than elsewhere.</li>
            <li> What can I say they just work.</li>
            <li> I tried the Gillette Fusion proglide razors but I didn&#x27;t care for them so I came back to the Fusions. Nice little discount when you buy the 12 count. They run about $16 bucks per 4 in the store and I got 12 for $40 so I roughly save 5-8 bucks.</li>
            <li> When it comes to shaving products, I know what I like and I am slow to change. With some occasional experiments with new brands, once I find what works best on my face, changes to other offerings are glacial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used another Gillette product (Excel blades) for nearly 20 years before their availability became limited. In my switch to the five-bladed Fusion, I found the near-perfect replacement for what I was accustomed to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While these are not the cheapest blades on the market, I get a week of comfortable shaves out of each blade, with the seventh being as crisp and free of dulling as the first. Could I go longer? Maybe...but I&#x27;m squeamish around blood (especially my own).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I test the disposable blades we keep around for travel bags and guests, these are what those get compared with, and they set a high bar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have tough beard, this will return a little bit of tenderness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, unlike the packaging that Fusion blades come from big box/club stores in: these arrive in a simple and easy to open container: nice!</li>
            <li> Everybody in the family uses these cartridges!  we&#x27;ve used them for a long time and will continue to do so...amazon has the best prices for them.</li>
            <li> Great shave at a high price.  If you value a clean shave, this is the way to go.  Have to pay for it of course.</li>
            <li> These razors raze very well. The pack was much cheaper than I can find in a store. Totally worth it with Super Saver Shipping</li>
            <li> The best razor ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each cartridge rests about a mounth and&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do reccomend Gillette Fusion cartridges, and always use.</li>
            <li> These are the best razor blades on the market, hands-down.  You get a great smooth shave every time, and they last awhile before you need to replace each individual cartridge.</li>
            <li> Great deal compared to what you find in your standard grocery/drug stores.  The razors are exactly the same, and are of good quality.</li>
            <li> These blades are the best of the best!</li>
            <li> had coupon so price was hard to beat</li>
            <li> As advertised; prompt delivery; fair price.</li>
            <li> Always reliable razor blade for close shave.</li>
            <li> These are the blades I prefer over all others.</li>
            <li> my husband has used these blades since college and was very happy with the price for this amount and the blades arrived in perfect shape. will be ordering more soon!</li>
            <li> Order arrived perfectly, thank you!</li>
            <li> My husband uses these every day and likes them enough to never look at others. So I guess they&#x27;re pretty good!</li>
            <li> The blades used to last through at least 20 shaves. Lately, not so much. I&#x27;m thinking the quality control has gone down. It maybe time for a new blade. Too bad, I&#x27;ve been using these for over a decade.</li>
            <li> The package arrived promptly and the packages contained the packages of razors in a store like display.  Better price per blade than purchased separately or in a store.</li>
            <li> At the time I began to shave (which I consider the bane of being a guy but look forward to getting done for the sake of looking professional, pleasing the lady, and not having a scraggly beard or whiskers), I&#x27;ve always wanted to shave as close as possible and not cut myself while shaving. (I&#x27;ve always looked lousy with a mustache and/or beard.) No razor blade is perfect but the Gillette Fusion is good enough. I refuse to pay prices at the supermarket and drug stores or go through all the madness of getting it cheap at Costco. The best bang for the buck and to save time is to get them via Amazon.</li>
            <li> These blades provide an excellent shave. I find them better than the 3 blade Gilette cartridges.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why this Gillette Fusion 12 count manual razor was shipped to me because i don&#x27;t believe I ever ordered it. Regardless i did not want it. This item is currently available from Costco</li>
            <li> There seem to be a lot of concerns that these may be factory seconds or knock-offs -- I found 8-packs direct from Gillette on their shop.gillette.com website for about $3/each, guaranteed to be factory originals.  I&#x27;d be wary of buying these bulk razors from Amazon...</li>
            <li> These are the same razors you purchase at the store- but for a third less. Even beats costco&#x27;s pricing.  Great deal</li>
            <li> They are so expensive any more. But they do make a good gift.</li>
            <li> Love these razor heads.</li>
            <li> These are the same refills on retail packaging, but at a much lower price.</li>
            <li> Been getting blades for over a year. Always come on schedule and product quality is always good. Will continue to use present setup for getting my blades.</li>
            <li> Great product. No complaints. Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> The best. I tried other brands,,, keep going back to Gillette.</li>
            <li> These are the real thing.  Not copycats.  Same as the expensive ones.</li>
            <li> Love these razors... hate the price!  I&#x27;m guessing that everyone does.  We keep buying them though because they are great, which keeps the price high I&#x27;m sure.  Enjoy your close shave everyone!</li>
            <li> Best blades I&#x27;ve found. Expensive, but they shave smooth and last a long time.</li>
            <li> These razor blades claim that &amp;#34;Just one 12-count blade refill can give you a full year of shaves (based on average days of use per refill)&amp;#34;.  This is definitely not true for us. I change it daily because the aloe wears off with my husband and I each using it one time. I just haven&#x27;t had time to find a new razor and razor blades, or I would have switched.</li>
            <li> I have used these razors since they were first introduced and have always worked great for me. The razors are very smooth.</li>
            <li> This by far the best razor that I have ever owned my entire life, sharp, clean cut, great price. Awesome</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how Amazon does it but this is 12 razors for the price of 8 anywhere else. Even better it comes in an easy to open and store carton, not those extra sharp plastic packages you can only open with a scissor.</li>
            <li> My husband has a tough, fast growing beard. [He is on medication that stiumlates hair growth, so the beard is abnormally fast growning.]Gillette Fusion Manual does the trick for him.</li>
            <li> The Fusion is the best razor I have ever used, period! I can&#x27;t imagine going back to any other brand.</li>
            <li> They are not. Sure Amazon has great deals on almost everything but these blades sure are not one of them.&lt;br /&gt;After buying and suscribing here, I saw the blades a few bucks cheaper in a store around the corner.</li>
            <li> I have been using these blades for years and by far one of the best shaves ever.  The only major problem is that they are a bit pricey.  While I do use the extra single blade, if that knocked the price down considerably I could do with the 5 on the other side.  The single side is great for edging your side burns and those tricky hairs in-between you eye brows (not a full on unibrow).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave is close, comfortable and smooth.  I also wished they held up a little better for a little longer.  The shaves after the first few are great, but nothing like the first one with the clean fresh blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have the money and are looking for a better shave, get this product.</li>
            <li> I thought maybe it was me, but I used a brand new Fusion razor that I got through the mail and it was smoooooooth.  These cartridges from Amazon ARE NOT THE SAME CARTRIDGES so I am going to send them back.  Buyer beware!!</li>
            <li> What can you say about these blades?  They are excellent.  I have found that by using this type of blade compared to other cheaper versions, I have had significantly less razor burn and cuts.  They are effective at cutting the hair, and they seem to last a good long time.  The five blades adds a smoothness that I never really got from other razors.  Yes, they are expensive, but they are worth the money.</li>
            <li> Slightly disappointed because I thought these were proglide, but still a great deal.  My mistake.</li>
            <li> This beats Costco prices, and these are authentic and work great!</li>
            <li> Although the packaging was different than the retail pack, the blades performed well. I believe them to be genuine. Good value.</li>
            <li> Love this deal and these are the blades I have ever had for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> was not happy with the quality...seems like these were the razors that could not meet the retail quality specs.....first use they hurt to to use, I&#x27;ve tried 6 of the 12 razors and they all are no good.</li>
            <li> no comments. Ordered and got what expected.</li>
            <li> In my opinion there are no better blades. They give me a good shave and one blade will provide at least seven days of close shaves and another 7 days of good-enough shaves. The problem is the price; they are getting more expensive every time I need to buy more. This time I decided to get me a 6 month supply and this package deal was the best I was able to find.</li>
            <li> As described and the lowest price I could find.</li>
            <li> These are absolutely fake or &amp;#34;irregular&amp;#34; and discarded by Gillette.  The blades provide a rough shave and cut into the skin.  Never happens with usual Fusion blades.</li>
            <li> These are great, but get the newer version.</li>
            <li> I USE GILLETE FUSSION LONG TIME EVEN I CAN&#x27;T SAY HOW LONG AND ONE OF THE DAY I FOUND BEST PRICE ON AMAZON.&lt;br /&gt;I HAVE NO IDEA HOW LONG I&#x27;LL HAVE THAT RAZOR........I HOPE MORE THAN YEAR.&lt;br /&gt;THANLS FOR GILLETE AND AMAZON.&lt;br /&gt;GIORGI</li>
            <li> Best price on Fusion blades, the only ones my husband uses, that I could find. Costco carries only the power blades and these are cheaper.</li>
            <li> Bulk buy saved me pennies. I like that and the blades are perfect. No need for the fancy coated blades for the vibrating razor, just these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second purchase cheaper than Walmart by $5? Yes please.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third purchase with coupon for $3 off. Still happy with the bulk buy.</li>
            <li> I shave my face, I shave my head, I...ok...TMI.  I like how the blades perform on my face and head.  Leaves my head and face as smooth as a baby&#x27;s behind.  Have this one set on automatic refill every couple of months.</li>
            <li> Removed - Prime movie review that mistakenly got placed into a product instead of a lousy Prime Series Pilot called After</li>
            <li> Better than I thought it would be. they fit well and is a whole lot less expensive through Amazon .</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally write a negative review unless I feel strongly about letting people know they should avoid the product at all cost, and this falls under that category. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s genuine or not. One thing I can attest is these are not the same as the store-bought one I&#x27;ve been using for years. Many reviewers had already pointed this out and I should have heeded their warning, but I just didn&#x27;t think Amazon would practice its business this way. Shame on me to be that naive I guess.</li>
            <li> Product came on time. As advertised. Happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> fit as expected and work great. love the price compared to the store.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this product and we have been using subscribe and save on this item for a while now!</li>
            <li> These are definitely not the same blades as I normally buy - after the first two shaves they tear your face up - sub-standard for the Gillette name to be associated. I can usually get at least a dozen great shaves from one blade.  Won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
            <li> these are definitively fake&lt;br /&gt;I have used the &amp;#34;same&amp;#34; Gilltete model for years with no issue. Threse ones irritate my skin in the first use.</li>
            <li> These blades are very comfortable, I get the best shave from this razor and the blades last me about a month before I have to replace it. Very fast shipping as well.</li>
            <li> with these razors, purchase Earth Friendly Products Shower Cleaner with Tea Tree Oil from Amazon as well. After each use of the razor, spray with Shower Cleaner and let dry. Your razors will last 4 times as long, guaranteed. The trick to long lasting razors is to dry the as quickly and as often as possible.</li>
            <li> I like these razor blades. They work well. I don&#x27;t shave that much so the stupid price of these blades doesn&#x27;t bug me as much as it could.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shave down and with gentle strokes and you can bring a 4mm beard to a clean face with few/no next-day pimples. That&#x27;s hard to beat for a multi-use disposable razor. I usually follow a close shave with a wash with my salicylic acid face wash to discourage razorburn acne.</li>
            <li> Great Item, Too expensive but no other co makes comparable razors. Best to buy as many as you can in one shot.</li>
            <li> Love these razors, they do a great job, leaving my face smooth without irritation.  They also last longer than most other cartridges, giving me more shaves for my dollar over all.</li>
            <li> As good or better than the ones I use to buy at the store and way cheaper.</li>
            <li> My 18 year old loves the Gillette Fusion Razors. He has sensitive skin and these blades don&#x27;t irritate him like others.</li>
            <li> Best way to buy these blades to save money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: I get about a week&#x27;s worth shaves out each blade. Watch out how you shave, they can nick. Still do not know what shave cream works the best foam or gel.</li>
            <li> Good blades. These were cheaper than buying in the store, and they seem to last as long as the blades from the store.</li>
            <li> Great bade and a great deal. Tried other brands, this blade gives me the closest and smoothest shave.</li>
            <li> My husband was very pleased</li>
            <li> I was a member of the Dollar Shave Club. I wasted my money on that. The Gillette Fusion is far superior to any other blade I have ever used. The blades last a long time. The DSC blades were good on the first use but always felt like they were pulling hair. The Gillette blades cut hair like butter. Amazing. I will not defect again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For any guys that shave their heads, these work great. First I shave with the Gillette Body blade. That blade gets close. Then I use these Proglide blades for an even closer shave without putting too much mileage on them.</li>
            <li> Best blade I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> I have to leave sets of blades in two houses and they came in a very nice box.</li>
            <li> very good product would buy again! Love them and wouldn&#x27;t trade them for a different kind! thank you very much</li>
            <li> Good product but I wish these were less expensive.</li>
            <li> Better than buying in the store.  I have been using this style of razor for long enough to know they work so getting a good supply at a good price is a good deal.</li>
            <li> Just your average everyday razor, nothing special or something to write home about. I just happened to have a spare Fusion blade&lt;br /&gt;holder otherwise I might have tried another brand.</li>
            <li> If you use these blades, they are the real deal for at least $4 cheaper that the lowest price on the internet.  If you&#x27;re a prime member it&#x27;s a no brainer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Gillette Fusion razor blades since just after they were released. They are miles better than the old Mach3 blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With my beard, I can get about 3 weeks out of a blade before I need to replace it. I&#x27;ve also tried the Fusion Power blades. They lasted a little longer... but I didn&#x27;t feel the performance was enough to justify their additional cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of cost... man are these blades expensive! My advice - use Amazon&#x27;s Subscribe and Save program and buy the best per blade deal. It&#x27;s not like they&#x27;re going to go bad before you use them!</li>
            <li> The blades work great.  I hate that the cost is so high.  I am really considering switching to a straight razor.</li>
            <li> I keep trying other blades and razors because of the price I have to pay for the Gillette Fusion blades, but I keep going back to the Gillette Fusion - they&#x27;re just the best blades for me. So, I signed up for Amazon&#x27;s monthly shipments to get the price down some and that helps. Now I can use the blade I prefer without feeling so guilty for spending so much on razor blades.</li>
            <li> Started purchasing this 12 pack of blades from Amazon but it seemed they didn&#x27;t last as long.  After 3 or 4 shaves, they would start giving me razor burn and some right out of the package seemed dull.  Bought a standard 8 pack at Target to compare and the Target blades were all sharp and lasted one to two weeks!  I see P&amp;G now responding to negative posts so going to give these one more shot since the price is $5 to $10 less than in stores.  Hopefully Amazon has changed who is providing these blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 4/1/14 - Latest order was much better than before.  Seems that the problems before were addressed.  Increasing to three stars.</li>
            <li> These are great!  This is the BEST shave EVER!  I got these to go with the Gillette Fusion Proglide Styler 3-in-1 Men&#x27;s shaver.  But ladies you need to try it too!</li>
            <li> Its really nice when you start using new blade but after 2-3 use some blades start hurting and do not give smooth shave.</li>
            <li> This is the Fusion Manual - NOT THE PROGLIDE.  What is pictured is what what is delivered, the Proglide pictured is only an advertisement.  Once you open the box the holder for the fusion manual includes a very large advertisement for the fusion proglide.  This is still a good razor, but I feel that the picture is quite deceiving.</li>
            <li> My husband shaves his head a few times per week and these are the best blades he has found.  They don&#x27;t nick and irritate like others he has tried. Best deal around and shipped straight to my door!</li>
            <li> Usually when I purchase at the store,  each cartridge last me for about a week.  These must have been defects,  they are dull after one use.  Guess you get what you pay for?</li>
            <li> Product was delivered in box with only 8 out of the 12 razors ordered!!</li>
            <li> This was a good price for the count compared to what I have seen. I received it promptly. The cartridges seemed brand new.</li>
            <li> I had been using the sensor excel for the last 15 years, then Gillette sent me this for free in the mail and it works great! These blades really help prevent razor burn and don&#x27;t cut me as much as my old razor did. I would highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> These blades are very expensive but work great.  Amazon is the best place to get them for the right price.</li>
            <li> I love this razor but the refill blades are expensive. I order when I need more, and this is cheaper than buying retail.</li>
            <li> Genuine Gillette blades.....Pricey, but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Just what I love...a great product at a great price! These have always been my go to razor blades and I&#x27;ve never been disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am always impressed with the inventive design and quality of Gillette razors and blades and this is their best so far. It does a great job on facial hair and is very comfortable to use. The blades are long lasting, don&#x27;t rust, and are easy to change. I once used a blade for an entire year, just to see how long they hold up. I change my blades every five to six months, because I find that is how long they last with daily use at optimum performance. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Just what I ordered, great razor blades</li>
            <li> The only thing I didn&#x27;t like about it was that the cartridge needed to be replaced after two shaves. Otherwise great product.</li>
            <li> Beware that these razors are IMITATORS of real Fusion blades.  They look identical but they are not the real deal.  This is a perfect example of something priced too good to be true.  The lubrication strip will be nearly gone after your first use and definitely gone by your second shave.  At that point you will have those blades digging into your skin and you WILL cut yourself real good.  Pay more and get the real blades and leave these alone!!!</li>
            <li> Really good deal for quality razors. Not sure if I will do the replenishment plan, but it&#x27;s nice to have the option.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to all who have to shave on a daily basses. Going to the store can get pricey.</li>
            <li> I received the Gillette Fusion razor for free from Gillette and catridge to review and will use again. I already love the Gillette brand and knew they wouldn&#x27;t let me down. The refills are easy to use and work great with the razor. Will use again.</li>
            <li> I use these blades because the razors does well with multiple shaves, and has a single rear blade to handle parts such as the upper lip, and chin. The lubricating strip doesn&#x27;t last as long as the blades sometimes, and Gillette notes when it is white - to replace the head - but they want you to use it more often to spend more money.</li>
            <li> OKay the fact is the razor industry has conned us all into buying their over priced fancy multiple blade disposable razors. That part I don&#x27;t like. They are wayyyyy over priced. So I found them on amazon.com for cheaper than WalMart and bought them.&lt;br /&gt;Having said that, they do work great and last a long time as long as you rinse them off really well after use.&lt;br /&gt;Very smooth shave every time.&lt;br /&gt;If you can find them cheaper somewhere else then get them there but these are the cheapest ones I could find.&lt;br /&gt;I have a light beard other wise I would just quit shaving all together because the price is ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;So to be honest the product itself is a 5 star but the price is a one star.</li>
            <li> Totally fine product.</li>
            <li> Great blade! Just like in the description, fast delivery, quality! Nothing even discuss everything is just perfect! Very convenient and advantageous to book immediately packaging. Will be ordering again and again! Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> Works as espected, I recomend</li>
            <li> too expensive but works.&lt;br /&gt;Need to consider another company next time.&lt;br /&gt;Do we really need 3 blades?&lt;br /&gt;I think I will try something else next time</li>
            <li> Bought these for hubby and he loves them. He already had the razor but generally purchased smaller packs of blades. This great discount and 12 at once-- He was happy.</li>
            <li> Both my fiance and I use these razors. He uses them on his face, and I use them on my legs. Better shave than the average womans razor.</li>
            <li> I have bought the 12 pack of these razors three times and even though back in 2011 they were only $30, they are stil a good deal at $42.  To save as much money as possible I now dab the razon on a bathroom towel after each use and it seems to extend the life of each razor by about a month.  I usually use 1 razor a month, and use them until they start cutting my face.  I am hoping this latest pack will last me a minumum of 18 months.  $42/18 months &#x3D; $2.33 per month in razors..I can handle that.</li>
            <li> This is another one of the great products that make me cringe whenever I buy them due to the price. Maybe I am just getting old. I do keep buying them though and Amazon has the price price I have found.</li>
            <li> I swap out my razors once a month. I have to shave every day because of work! But these razors do the job all month long.  Also I am happy I finally found my ALL YEAR LONG pack instead of paying the OUTRAGEOUS prices at my local retail stores for a 2,4  or 6 pack. Great PRICE!</li>
            <li> These Are the same Fusion blades I get at the local retailers. I get much better value. The shipping is a breeze.</li>
            <li> Not too much to say, but the Fusion is my favorite razor. They cause the least amount of pain, and get the closest shave out of anything I&#x27;ve used. This is probably the best price you will be able to find anywhere ever, except for some knock offs that won&#x27;t be nearly as good.</li>
            <li> like the product, they are in handy came at right price</li>
            <li> I could only find the 8 package.  I wanted the 12 package....MY MISTAKE....I DID GET THE 12 PACKAGE!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> These were the Fusion blades, not the Fusion Proglide like pictured, be aware!  Sadly I didn&#x27;t realize until after the return window closed.</li>
            <li> seem as good as the one&#x27;s I used to pay twice as much for.</li>
            <li> What a deal.  All these blades, fit for both facescaping and manscaping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonus is the packaging, which cuts down on cost.</li>
            <li> Worst razors I&#x27;ve ever purchased. These are so bad that I think they might be bootlegged or falsely labeled. The same brand purchased OTC are completely different than what I received.</li>
            <li> best deal on fusion razors by far.  great stuff.</li>
            <li> The way the prices for Men&#x27;s Fusion Manuel Cartridges being very costly and giving your hard earned dollars a very close shave, these 12 Fusion Cartridges for the price charged is a sharp deal. Buy it, you can&#x27;t go wrong.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I purchase these every few months with subscribe and save.  The blades are extremely sharp and leave a nice smooth surface after the shave.</li>
            <li> Gillette Fusion gives a nice smooth, longer lasting shave to each blade.&lt;br /&gt; Other simular products that I&#x27;ve used don&#x27;t compare to Gillette Fusions number of shave per blade per blade.</li>
            <li> As always, good shave!</li>
            <li> I am quite pleased with this item.</li>
            <li> I was trying to save money and cut the heck out of myself with the cheapies or didn&#x27;t get a close shave at all.  Shaving is not a place to economize.</li>
            <li> Great price. on the same razor for over a month.  (shave face and head.)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m about to purchase these for the third time.  Both my wife and I use them and they work great.</li>
            <li> I had a pregnant moment and ordered these. Thought there were more in the package. CRAZY expensive for only 12 razors. Costco next time for sure!</li>
            <li> I love my Gillette Fusion vibrating razor. I almost never get nicks since I switched from regular manual razors. This is a great pack and will last we the whole year since I have a blade sharpener too (that I got at the &amp;#34;As seen on TV&amp;#34; section of my pharmacy store some years back.) It&#x27;s not so much the pack of razor blades that perk me up as much as the whole package of getting them for a decent price considering they are so expensive and knowing it will work for me for a whole year. And I don&#x27;t mean a year of shaving my face. I&#x27;m a woman and it became hard to find vibrating razors last year when my old one broke down. I had to settle for the men&#x27;s one, which works on my legs, underarms and etc. I don&#x27;t know why more people aren&#x27;t demanding the vibrating razors, as regular ones irritate the skin. My mom borrowed mine and she almost stole it! You can practically be careless and not hurt yourself.</li>
            <li> Bcos this is the first razor my husband demands. He used to use disposable Bics and now only uses fusion</li>
            <li> Tried a different brand recently--a subscription of Harry&#x27;s.  Looked nice and was definitely cheaper to buy, but didn&#x27;t come close to the quality and sharpness of the Gillette Fusion blades and didn&#x27;t last nearly as long.  Less drag and no nicks with the Gillette. This razor stays sharp longer than other brands so it ends up being less expensive to use over the long term.</li>
            <li> Best razors you can buy at the best price you&#x27;ll find. They last a long time if you clean them and dry them after each use!</li>
            <li> Expensive. For that kind of money I would prefer that the blade last me a full month instead of three weeks</li>
            <li> I have tried the Gillette Fusion for a few days now and WOW. You only need one pass to get a close shave and it does not pull at your skin especially at the neck line. I was using cheap razors that you would have to keep going over the same spot and would pull at the neck line a lot. The blades are super easy to replace. I would definitely recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> I love the Gillette Fusion Razor and the refills I have no complaints about either product I think it works very well the only problem I have is the refills are a little pricey but I guess that&#x27;s to be expected form a good quality product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite different from what Gillette ever made. First of all, this is my first razor with 5 blades! It&#x27;s not faster shaving, but it&#x27;s defiantly cleaner. And, yep, don&#x27;t press to hard! Sensitive skin could be easily irritated! And honestly i have never been a fan of combining two products in one. Precision Trimmer is defiantly useless for me. But it doesn&#x27;t make the razor worse. Got it for testing from the Gillette. Thanks for experience!</li>
            <li> I received these razors from Gillette to try them out; and all I can say is that these razor blade refills work great. It&#x27;s easy to replace these blade refills, and their package make it convenient for storing them. The thing that amazes me the most is that these are five blade razors and they work great on me, even though I have really thick hair. Also, these blades are sharp but their design prevents me from cutting myself. I have tried many other razors and most of them will cut you once in a while but these just seem to be engineered in a different way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s worth it to spend a little more and get razors that work properly. I know I can&#x27;t go back to buying other cheap razors I used to buy. I guess now I&#x27;m spoiled with the performance that Gillette delivers. I highly recommend buying Gillette Fusion razors and refills, especially when they go on sale, many times you can get coupons for them too.</li>
            <li> Gillette provided me this product for free for the purpose of trying and reviewing. I believe the Razor does a good job. It gives a pretty close shave, but nothing to get ecstatic about. I am very frugal on the borderline cheap. Therefore, pay $5+ per cartridge opposed to $1 or less for a disposal razor, I personally do not find the difference worth the cost.</li>
            <li> They work as well as the ones in the store.  Having tried 1-5 blades, 5 blades definitely makes a difference especially if you have sensitive skin and/or prefer to shave against the grain.  It&#x27;s an expensive treat for your face.</li>
            <li> I received this product for free as a bzzagent. The refills are easy to use. Work just as good as the one the razor comes with. They are however just a tad pricey. I feel like I should just buy a whole razor next time instead of the razor refills. But overall this is a great razor.</li>
            <li> Not much to say, they r the real thing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the fusion blades for the past 5 years but recently had to buy cheaper ones and paid the price with a nicked up face after shaving.  This is a great deal!</li>
            <li> I picked this up at the store, because i wanted to have more than a month&#x27;s worth of razors for once. I love the Fusion razor, so no complaints there, but I do have to call into question the idea that 12 cartridges will last me a year. Granted, I have a very coarse beard and sensitive skin, so regardless of whether I shave every day, every other day, or once a week, I&#x27;m still getting skin irritation by the 7th or 8th day. As a result, a blade is comfortable on my face for a week, then I need to change it out. What this means for me is that 12 cartridges&#x3D;3.5 months, not a year. And that&#x27;s ok, because buying the 12-pack is cheaper (per cartridge) than the 4.&lt;br /&gt;I just think Gillette should lay off advertising the bulk pack as a year&#x27;s worth, since most guys (I know, at least) go through more than one cartridge a month.&lt;br /&gt;I am going to try the one reviewer&#x27;s suggestion on extending the life of the blades, and see if that works--my skin will let me know.</li>
            <li> I bought these online because they were cheaper than in the store.  But the quality is lacking!  My husband cut himself badly while shaving with these.  I&#x27;ve canceled my subscription and would rather pay more for higher quality.</li>
            <li> Best blades I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> Best blades for the money. Get a months use from just one blade.</li>
            <li> Excellent vet good product</li>
            <li> I received an additiobal cartridge in the box together with my razor - this is a good side. Te bad side is that it disappointed me. I was expecting it to give extra clean shave, but it didn&#x27;t do it. It wasn&#x27;t as sharp as i thought it will be. I love Gillette razors, but i&#x27;ll use the one i used before.</li>
            <li> I thoroughly enjoyed my experience with the Gillette Fusion Razor. I have a very thick beard and this razor did an excellent job at cutting through the hair that has proven too tough for most other razors! I plan to use this razor for my shaving needs.  The refills come out of the package easily and effortlessly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jeff614</li>
            <li> I received the razor for free to try out via Gillette. The Gillette fusion is a great product, cartridge were easy to use and helps dispose of my used blades easily.</li>
            <li> Great price on my favorite razors.</li>
            <li> I shave every weekday morning for work. This razor works well. I have not yet cut myself and have been using it for over a week now. Monday morning are the &amp;#34;hardest&amp;#34; shave because I have not shaved in two days. That is when I have cut myself with previous razors. The cartridge replacement system is very easy and simple. They are sharp and cut well. I think I will be purchasing more cartridges for this razor. My wife uses Gillette too. I received this razor and cartridge from Gillette for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> I got 12 blades for the price the stores sell 8 blades for. Best deal on a great shave. I will order this again.</li>
            <li> Hubby Loves the Blades.&lt;br /&gt;He loves the price.&lt;br /&gt;He loves the ease of use.&lt;br /&gt;I love his smooth face.&lt;br /&gt;Love.</li>
            <li> On time delivery. Gives great shave. I don&#x27;t pay much attention to the &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; coating. I use one cartridge until I stop getting the result I want. 4 stars because I think the blades are too expensive.</li>
            <li> I have ordered these blades since they are the best I have ever used.  I cannot find anything to complain about except the price.  The price everywhere is too high in my opinion.  Still, I need to shave.</li>
            <li> what can I say, they work fine. Can&#x27;t understand why others find the need to complain about something as simple as a razor blade.</li>
            <li> The higher cost is easily off set by the smoothshave and the logevity so I use less blades and ultimately spen less with fusion blades</li>
            <li> Buying these in bulk provided a great savings. I swear by these blades. Very comfortable shave and rarely a nick.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I could ever go back to 4 blades. 5 blades are great. Makes my skin so smooth and the lotion strip makes my skin feel moisturized. With 5 blades I feel that I have the closest shave you can get. Highly recommend! I received the product from the brand.</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t get a better deal anywhere than this! move over dollar shave club.</li>
            <li> Took over a year to use all of them. Excellent! Will buy again and hope to get the same price.</li>
            <li> I was worried that these may be knock offs but they have lasted as long as the ones I have bot from the big box stores.</li>
            <li> I shave about every other day due to skin irritation from other razors that I have used. I purchased a Gillette Fusion razor with a $4 off coupon out of the Sunday news, and that gave me the razor for about $1 after the in-store rebate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is easily the best razor I have ever owned/used. One pull of the razor across my face makes the skin unbelievably smooth. I won&#x27;t be switching to anything else after buying this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIPS:&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t throw the cartridges out after the aloe &amp;#34;indicator&amp;#34; strip fades - that thing is useless junk added on to make you replace the blades more often than is necessary. Keep a bottle of alcohol handy with your shaving supplies. The thing that dulls most razor blades quickly is hard water deposits of calcium and other minerals that build up on the blades when they dry after rinsing. They key to getting the most use out of the blades is to rinse the water off with alcohol after use, and then let the blades air dry. I can get more than a month of shaves out... Read more</li>
            <li> I was very satisfied with these cartridges. I love the precision blade, it&#x27;s perfect for perfecting lines and keeping everything straight. I like the case it comes in, makes it easy to keep up with all of the blades and takes up very little space. The blades give an extra close shave and have been great on my sensitive skin. I would recommend these for anyone and everyone as I have had a wonderful experience with the Gillette Fusion Razor Blades!</li>
            <li> once about a time i bought these and all is o.k.  today .  now i can buy more  now i&#x27;m done</li>
            <li> Gillette Fusion is my fave razor and I buy their cartridges as needed. You can&#x27;t get better price than this one. I use to buy at my local drug store but was paying way too much. Still, on pricey side but well worth the money.</li>
            <li> good price for the amount of refills you get</li>
            <li> Expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> Product received with no issues.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed in these. They are very expensive and the advertisements tout what a wonderful shave you will get but the blades only last for about 2 shaves and then they are worthless. I&#x27;ve tried several brands and types of razors and I will NOT buy these again. I&#x27;m very disgusted and feel ripped off as I could have bought original Gillette blades with my money and gotten so much use out of them!!!</li>
            <li> 2nd time ordering and will order again, great product at a nice savings.</li>
            <li> Great product love the blades</li>
            <li> GREAT SERVICE &amp; GREAT PRODUCT, THANKS</li>
            <li> I received this in the mail for free to test and review from Gillette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of my life, I&#x27;ve only purchased disposable razor blades. Whatever disposable razor pack brand is on sale at the moment, is what I pick up. This has definitely changed for me since trying the Gillette Fusion Razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blade contours to the shape of your face, without having to put much pressure. The 5 blades give a very close shave, and I didn&#x27;t even have to use any shaving cream. I was able to shave in the shower like I normally do and just used water.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also very helpful that the lubrication strip will turn to white so I know it&#x27;s time to change the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like how the top of the blade is left uncovered. This makes it so much easier to clean after use. Unlike all other razors I&#x27;ve used, you never have access to the top of the blade.</li>
            <li> Never again will I be suckered into buying cheap blades.  These might cost more, but well worth it.  They actually end up being less expensive because they last a lot longer.</li>
            <li> Not much to say other than it&#x27;s Gillette (the best a man can get).  I gave this 4 stars as I really never found a use for the extra blade (for trimmings).</li>
            <li> The Fusion blades are a good product but pricey. I generally get about 15-20 shaves out of one blade (but then again I don&#x27;t have a very dense beard).. It does pay to be particularly careful with the first couple of shaves to avoid nicking yourself while the blade is at its sharpest. Have a styptic pencil at the ready!</li>
            <li> what can I say. Been using these for years. Tried the Harry&#x27;s blades, but not the same although alot cheaper, they are not even in the same League the Gillette Fusion. 12 blades will last me and my wife well over a year. These are must have if  you want clean smooth shave.</li>
            <li> I used to use the Schick Titanium with 4 blades and a single trimmer. This was the first time I&#x27;ve purchased a Gillette Fusion razor, because the price here in bulk was cheaper than in packs of 4. I have been extremely pleased with the switch. I do use a pre-shave oil. However these razors still feel very sharp and give me a great shave for a long period of time. The trimmer piece also stays sharp for much longer, giving a more comfortable and accurate trim for each razor.</li>
            <li> My Father loved this as a gift and for the price- I should have gotten two!!</li>
            <li> I have a pretty weak beard, so I can usually get 6 months to a year out of a single cartridge. This 12 pack are genuine Gillettte Fusion refills and they work great. I&#x27;m guessing it will be a long time before I need to buy more. I do use the manual blades with the power handle with no issues. It gives me a nice clean shave and feels better than using the regular handle.</li>
            <li> These are the best disposable razors there are. You COULD get all manly and stuff and get a straight razor, but the blood stains are hard to get out.</li>
            <li> My husband has really coarse black hair and these razors get the job done without being too harsh on his skin. The leave a close shave and last considerably longer than the cheap ones so you come out the same, at least fiscally because you have to replace them less.</li>
            <li> I received the Gillette fusion blades as a free sample. I am usually a mach 3 kind of guy but I have to say these blades are really impressive. They give a nice clean shave. I definitely see a change for me.</li>
            <li> I was given this razor/cartridge from Gillette to try out &amp; review. Overall I am very pleased. I really don&#x27;t have anything bad to say! My wife prefers that I don&#x27;t shave...she likes me &amp;#34;fuzzy&amp;#34;. But my job says that I have to shave. So I try to please both and only shave once every five days or so. The Gillette Fusion razor worked great on my 5 day growth. Didn&#x27;t pull and gave a close shave. I can get a few uses out of each cartridge. I&#x27;ve tried cheaper razors/disposables and most of them are only good for one shave. Thumbs up! I gave a 4-star review basically for cost...because the cartridges can be a bit more expensive than other brands....but you also get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Thank you to Gilette for giving me the Gilette Fusion and cartridge refill free of charge for testing purposes. I use it every day that I shave (which is Monday through Friday unless I have a big weekend event). I really enjoy using it. The cartridges are very simple to change out and last a long time. They are sharp and get the job done - especially on Monday mornings when I have a lot of coarse hair. This is a great deal for this many cartridges.</li>
            <li> Easy to take out of the cartridge, easy to recognize when to re-place the blade. But be careful when new, one sharp little thing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a Gillette fusion Razor and replacement cartridge through Gillette as sample to try, and I have to say I really like it. I used the Gillette Fusion a few years back and don&#x27;t know why I stopped using it. But it wont happen again!</li>
            <li> These cartridges I received from Gillette are awesome!  I love the trimming blade on the back.  I recommend these to anyone wanting a close shave.  The only real downside to it that I can see is that I think they could last longer.  Still a great product.  Thanks Gillette for allowing me to test your great product free of charge!</li>
            <li> Arrived on-time and as expected.</li>
            <li> Gift for son.  Loves &#x27;em.</li>
            <li> I am impressed so far with how many shaves I can get on one cartridge. I am at about 10-12 shaves so far and it seems like I can get at least 3-5 more. The cartridges are certainly more expensive than buying disposable razors, but they provide a much better shave by far.</li>
            <li> You cannot beat Gillette razors. I do not even look at other brands or types anymore. It is not worth the bother when Gillette makes such a good product.</li>
            <li> Good Produst these are like my second order</li>
            <li> I shave every day. These blades don&#x27;t last as long as the Fusions in store.  Good price though.</li>
            <li> I have these on subscription now for my husband. One every 3 months seems to work well for him. Much cheaper than retail outlets. Still pricey to me but what do I know. What the man wants the man gets.</li>
            <li> Blades were as advertised and a good value. I will order them again</li>
            <li> they do much better job and appear sharper than any other Gillette razors, I will keep buying these over any other kind</li>
            <li> This is the only razor that my husband will use now. They are great and arrive when stated that they would. They are always packed well and arrive in great condition. Thank you</li>
            <li> Hard to get too excited about razor blades, but I like these.</li>
            <li> These seem to be real Gillette Fusion blades.  They are much cheaper than what you can find them for at the local store.  I thought they might be fakes but they seem to be real ones.  They work great.  My husband says so since he uses them.  I&#x27;d definitely recommend them to anyone looking to buy refills for their razor.</li>
            <li> This is a review for the 12 pack, and is mainly to address some concerns from some people that these might not be genuine. Don&#x27;t worry, they are real.  This item was purchased and fulfilled by Amazon directly.  The outer box is plain white, but inside is some kind of special Gillette packaging, and what I received looked exactly like the pictures here on Amazon, complete with Gillette logos, colors, and everything.  The 12 blades inside are in 3 separate plastic 4-blade holders, same as what is used in the 4 blade packs you buy in the store.  These are most definitely genuine Gillette Fusion blades.  They work great, just like you would expect of a pack of these you paid more for in a store.</li>
            <li> Great purchase, my hysband and son enjoy having them.</li>
            <li> Convenience at a great price!!  An excellent alternative to going to the grocery store.</li>
            <li> Knowing that I will always have blades when I need them has been a godsend.  The resulting shave and comfort has been better than many other disposable cartridges that I have tried.</li>
            <li> I am a man and love a smooth shave.  I use Venus for my beard and Gillette Fusion for trimming my mustace.  Nice product.</li>
            <li> Have loved these blades for years and this is a hassle free way to get them.</li>
            <li> Great value compared to the grocery store.</li>
            <li> I saw reviews saying they thought these could be knock offs. They could be, but they perform great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I notice is that I have cut myself more often with these than I have before with the stock blades, not sure the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I love these blades and would recommend them to anyone.</li>
            <li> Great value, way better than what most department stores offer for this quantity.  Worked with my Fusion Proglide.  Will definitely order these from now on.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend. Bought these after browsing Costco, and these were less expensive! Lots of options and all at a great price.</li>
            <li> Decent Quality and last a long time for the price you pay. I would definitely buy again in the future.</li>
            <li> I felt these were not original gillete, the blades when shaving did not have the smooth shave. I bought from walmart and had a different nice smooth shave . Not sure if these are rejected or returned Gillette baldes, which are re-sold</li>
            <li> Never a nick or slice. One close shave. Smooth. Sometimes more is better.</li>
            <li> Nice to have a lot of these in a bundle.  Helps to save on the large cost of disposable razors.</li>
            <li> These are the only razors I like to use. They last a long time for me, usually a month or longer, and continue to provide an excellent shave. They cost but seem so worth it. They have the extra blade for more fine shaving around the nose and sideburns. The strip doesn&#x27;t last long, but it&#x27;s still a super razor.</li>
            <li> This product is very good for shaving on daily basis, because it is clean, easy to use, fast to be replaced when it is old and most importantly, it is very easy to see when the blades are no longer sharp (because of the blue / green line righ above it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using this product in 2009 and since then, I never stopped and I just intent to do it when I find a better option for shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The delivery process was ok, with no surprises from the seller. It was a good deal, for sure I would recomend it.</li>
            <li> the cheapest and the best no shave club for me</li>
            <li> Just like the pic..great</li>
            <li> Not as sharp as the store bought blades Do not do the same job...Dull very fast..Will not buy again</li>
            <li> Subscription deal is awesome for the razors, I like being able to manage my next orders.</li>
            <li> Great deal. Will last all year</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for at a great price. I can always count on Amazon to have and deliver what I need.</li>
            <li> Very good product at a good price cheapest I&#x27;ve seen.it is nice to be able to buy a pack 12 for the price of 6 saved about $ 10 bucks buying this way.</li>
            <li> Ok - this is short and sweet:  If you&#x27;ve never tried a modern, state-of-the-art razor blade, you don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re missing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try a Gillette Fusion product - it feels like you&#x27;re shaving with the round side of a plastic knife - smooooooooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You get what you pay for - these blades last a long, long time, spreading their initial purchase price over three, four, five weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try quality and you will be happy.  Costco and Sams have the best quantity pricing.</li>
            <li> The best simple razor ever made. I have used it ever since it was first available. No need to try other brands.</li>
            <li> These seem like the same exact blades I have bought in the store. I am satisfied! Will buy again for sure.</li>
            <li> I have been using these blades for a few years now. I recommend them to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are very comfortable and they hold up well compared to other disposable razor heads I&#x27;ve tried. These glide easily over the skin and are easy to clean as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s not much more to say about these. I recommend them to others based on years of use.</li>
            <li> My Husband loves this shaving system</li>
            <li> Was a great deal since we go through them so quickly. It&#x27;s amazing how expensive razors have become.</li>
            <li> Recently learned I should change my blades after every other shave. Even though these are pricey, Amazon seems to have the best pricing.</li>
            <li> When I buy these at target, they are great. These blades were dull/uneven as if they were sitting around the warehouse breaking down, but that&#x27;s just conjecture. I do know that the blades from this pack felt rough and scratched my skin. At first I thought it was one bad egg, but they were all like that. I won&#x27;t be ordering more.</li>
            <li> Arrived as promised, shaving is great. Same as the ones you buy in fancier packaging in the store.</li>
            <li> Good deal.  Arrived super fast.</li>
            <li> Too expensive. Go with Dollar Shave Club instead.</li>
            <li> I switched last year to the Gillette Fusion razor (ProGlide) - and love it. I never thought a simple razor (powered by a simple AAA battery) could be so efficient and effective. But with every razor comes the need for blades (which is what ends up being the true expense of shaving). Buying quantity reduces that price - and buying monthly through Amazon&#x27;s reminder program facilitates the process. The Fusion Manual Cartridges are excellent in my opinion. They are reliably consistent, providing a time-efficient smooth shave. I use each blade 2-3 times - and for me, am happy to have finally found &amp;#34;my solution&amp;#34; for shaving that eluded me for many years with numerous previous razor systems and blades that I have tried. Thank you for this product!</li>
            <li> This is the only blade we use. It works without bloodshed and limited burn. Wife and husband both use these both older with thinning skin. And the price was best anywhere.</li>
            <li> Shaving a tough beard and sensitive skin can be a problem. However, This product makes it a pleasent experience when a daily shave is a must. A close shave without skin cuts is shaving at its best.</li>
            <li> Best shave I&#x27;ve found</li>
            <li> Outstanding price, better than Costco, and packaging is excellent and easy to unpack. I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many types of razor blades, but I always come back to Gillette despite their outrageous prices.  I guess the concept of &amp;#34;getting what you pay for&amp;#34; applies for this industry.  It really depends on how close and smooth of a shave you want, and how much you&#x27;re willing to pay for it.</li>
            <li> These razors are exactly as advertised. They fit perfectly into my Gillette Fusion Proglide razor and they give me some of the smoothest shaves I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> Good razors. I have switched mostly to electric these days but when I need to look good for something I&#x27;ll go for the razors and get the smoother shave. The only reason I removed a star is that the lube strip on these did not seem to last nearly as long as the ones bought in the store. Maybe it has to do with the way they were stored in the warehouse? Who knows. 4/5</li>
            <li> Great value. Purchasing these with subscribe and save is cheaper than you can get them anywhere other than a &amp;#34;club&amp;#34; store or a Marine Corp Recruit Depot PX</li>
            <li> A very good bargain for an excellent blade.  I would have to pay lot more at the store for the same number of blades.</li>
            <li> Great Product!  Arrived exactly as expected, high quality.</li>
            <li> received quickly and razor blades are great</li>
            <li> Great product, I shave my head and face every morning with this product. Smooth, no cuts, no scrapes. The glide strip helps cut down on any friction.&lt;br /&gt;Very economical to purchase versus the drug store, Wal-Mart etc.. delivered to my house on a regular schedule. NO BRAINER!</li>
            <li> These are good refills my husband thought that it was very convenient to use and they arrived within days we did not have to wait a whole month for him to start using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;booboo&#x27;s girl</li>
            <li> Was happen with the product and the time to receive it for free shipping BUT was very unhappy the credit card i used to purchased with had been compromised was been used to purchase 2 different times air line tickets to Kenya in the same day and a purchase with some learn a new language site and I had not e en received my product yet I to cancel my credit card</li>
            <li> I joined the subscription service for Gillette Fusion Manual Cartridges, the cartridges are legit and through the Amazon subscription service your able to save a few dollars monthly on your purchase of the cartridges.</li>
            <li> Yeah these are razors for shaving....if you like Fusion blades you&#x27;ll like these because that&#x27;s what they are. No fancy but blades.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.  These are more expensive than most, but they last longer than your typical cheap razor.  My husband and I both use them.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Smoothest &amp; cleanest shave ever!!  Never a nick or cut!  Using it in the shower without gel or shaving cream.</li>
            <li> This is exactly like the packs I used to buy at Target BUT WITH FOUR MOUR IN THE PACK. SO LONG, TARGET! YEAH!!!!</li>
            <li> Please be aware that these blades are not official Gillette blades and that they will only last for one week each before they are blunt. Overall, since the official Gillette blades last for a month, we are all better off financially bying the official ones in a standard shop. My 2 cents.</li>
            <li> The Gillette Fusion system is a great for shaving. It may be a bit pricey but I have never had a closer shave with any other product. I switched from a \\&quot;three-blade\\&quot; system which was good but it can not compare to the 5 blade. I was skeptical though I&#x27;m glad I made the switch.</li>
            <li> Love gillette razors..I strayed for a month to try dollar shave club but wow talk about going from luxury to crap. Gillette is number 1 for a reason.</li>
            <li> These are good razors and a grate value, but there just not very good on my neck gives me bad razor burn other than that they are grate...</li>
            <li> While this is a big change compared to dual blade razors, they seem to dull fairly quickly, and the moisturizing strip doesn&#x27;t seem to last more than 3-4 days for me.  I&#x27;ve tried drying it off after using it, but it doesn&#x27;t extend the life that long (and it seems like a big expense based up on the sort life).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m switching to the Shick Hydro, as I got a free sample, and the blade there has lasted two, going on three weeks.  I may have to try the shower cleaner trick to see how long I can make the Hydro&#x27;s last.</li>
            <li> Husband uses only this blade and likes the shave he gets. This time he purchased them in quantity so he saved $.</li>
            <li> Good value. The right type of blade for me.</li>
            <li> Best deal you can find. My boyfriend is happy with the quality.</li>
            <li> best thing I bought in a long time!</li>
            <li> Sorry Costco stopped selling these supeb 5-blade refills. And why switch to the less expensive 3-blade alte Gillette when one has three Fusion handles.</li>
            <li> Best price I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> too expensive.  the Turbo blades are not nearly as goods they used to be either.</li>
            <li> While shaving my head and neck is very important to me, this is perfect for use plus cost effective.&lt;br /&gt;highly recommended</li>
            <li> I bought these due to the price point, but Gillette blades are fungible no matter where you buy them. Good price for them.</li>
            <li> I ordered these with subscribe and save and they were shipped and sold by amazon.com. They look really great but the quality is not what I expected. I can&#x27;t determine whether I just got a bad batch, and it took me beyond the return window to realize the issue.</li>
            <li> the gillette Fusion has been my go to blade for a long time. Just got replaced by Harry&#x27;s. Gillette is a 4 star product at a 2 star price. Harry&#x27;s goes 5 and 5.</li>
            <li> Except for the high price, they are very good and smooth shaving.</li>
            <li> Check out the video  So I was convinced to try dollar shave club after seeing all those cool commercials and checking out the website .So this is my opinion comparing years of using the Gillette razors vs Dollar Shave Club mid range 4x razor&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
            <li> I wish these were available for subscription</li>
            <li> Decent price, but not much below retail</li>
            <li> Superb razor blade quality from a reputable manufacturer.  That sums it up in a short sentence.  Lets face it.  Shaving is a chore, it&#x27;s something we have to think about as a man.  Not only that, but there are several brands to choose from, so which one? Stop right there. You found it.  Gillette Fusion is the best a man can get. LOL I&#x27;m serious.  I shave my face everyday since I don&#x27;t like facial hair.  Growing up I went through several brands trying to find the right one but once I tried Fusion I didn&#x27;t have to look anywhere else.  In fact recently I had the opportunity from BzzAgent to try these blades for free.  The blades are amazing quality and last a really long time.  I do not experience nicks or cuts on my face due to shaving anymore.  Once the blue/green strip on the blade starts to fade, you know it&#x27;s time to replace.  I can sometimes get a couple weeks out of one blade.  And it gets better....not only have you found the only razor blade you need, but you can also get them delivered to your door automatically! That&#x27;s right just set your subscription to how often you would like them delivered.  I mean it makes sense, your going to need razors for the rest of your adult life so why not just have them delivered when you need them?  I&#x27;m sold.  Thanks Gillette!</li>
            <li> There is a difference between Fusion Proglide and just Fusion blades. This is a lower price because it is lower quality. Check out there web site.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re expensive, but they last a while and give a great shave.</li>
            <li> Love this razor and getting blades is always cheaper when you get them in multi-packs of 8 or 12. The more in the pack, the cheaper they are.</li>
            <li> Best value for your buck, as opposed to purchasing from Walmart or Target; is exactly what you&#x27;d find in-stores, for a better deal.</li>
            <li> I have used Fusion razors since they were introduced. In 2012, I purchased a customized Koa wood razor handle that would accomodate the Fusion blades so I could enjoy the consistently smooth clean shaves for which I have become accustomed.</li>
            <li> Why would you pay full price?</li>
            <li> Prefect amount for my family</li>
            <li> I hate buying these blades but they are the only blades that I enjoy while shaving off my manly beard without getting a rash on my girly sensitive skin I was blessed with.</li>
            <li> These blades along with my powered Art of Shaving razor makes for the perfect shave every time.</li>
            <li> great buy...husband loves these</li>
            <li> MUCH cheaper than buying refills at a department store. And my boyfriend, who is required by his work dress code to shave every single day, loves these. Smoother shave, no nicks or bumps, and they last a few weeks each cartridge. Best option out there for every-day shavers who do not want to use an electric shaver. These cartridges fit both Gillette Fusion and Gillette Fusion Power razors.</li>
            <li> The blades arrived on time. They looked to be brand new and owed as such upon first time use. I notice less pull with the provide blades than the other  brands I&#x27;ve bought in the past. I would consider this a solid purchase.</li>
            <li> I have a sensitive face and these razors help reduce the bumps from ingrown hairs. I use to use all other sorts of creams and aftershave to help reduce bumps after shaving and realized it was my razor. I&#x27;ll only use Gillette from now on. They keep improving their products.</li>
            <li> I bought these in the 12 count because it was cheaper than the smaller packs, plus the Subscription also helped.  I do wish that the moisturizing strips, and razor as a whole would last just a big longer.  But, it&#x27;s a comfortable shave while it&#x27;s sharp.</li>
            <li> They exist and work. Not much more you can ask for</li>
            <li> If I could  rate this product less than one star I would.  For the price, they are a complete rip-off.  I have used this product before and have purchased it from Amazon previously.  The color strips on these are orange, when previously they were blue.  Even the first shave from these cartridges is uncomfortable.  Subsequent shaves are much worse.  Do not waste your money.  If you like the Gillette brand, spend a little more and buy them from your local store.  These are obviously reject products and Amazon should not be selling them.</li>
            <li> I shave my head and face twice a week,  this is a great deal.. I&#x27;ve tried many different brands and found that Gillette is the best.</li>
            <li> As advertised and must be the real thing!</li>
            <li> I figured I would try these razors because Amazon.com has a great return policy if it turned out that these were fake, but I see no indication at all that these are not the real thing. I&#x27;ve been using the same style razor for a few years, and its quality and longevity are superb. Some people are so convinced that something \\&quot;will be\\&quot; fake, that even when the real thing is in front of them, they won&#x27;t see it. I am happy I took a chance to try these out, I will buy them again.</li>
            <li> The high quality and fair  price are as expected. Always helpful to have a small quantity to fit a new razor, be sure to order some. Walmart is much higher priced.</li>
            <li> These days it is the best razor out there. I am 50 years old and had used Gillette Trac II forever, until these came along.</li>
            <li> They provide a shave, but it seems to me that they don&#x27;t last as long as the Gillette branded blades.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to get a year&#x27;s supply of something I don&#x27;t like purchasing over with. They arrived new and undamaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I&#x27;ll be trying a safety razor next. Rick Harrison can sell, sell, sell</li>
            <li> Not sure where these blades came from, but they are horrible. I bought some from my local grocery store just to be sure. Seems whenever I use these I get terrible razor burn. They last about 1 or 2 shaves before butchering my face. The store bought blades last me about a week. I think something is wrong here and I don&#x27;t plan to buy them again. Sad, because I really liked the idea of saving by bulk buying.</li>
            <li> These refills are very expensive at retail stores. Got a good price and a coupon for $6.00 off with free shipping.  Couldn&#x27;t pass it up.</li>
            <li> best razors I have ever used.  Expensive but good.  I usually use each cartridge for 7 days.</li>
            <li> easiest best priced way to keep them at hand.</li>
            <li> Great Deal, cheaper than anywhere else in Hawaii.  Got with a $6.00 coupon, so BONUS!</li>
            <li> Cheaper than any other place I have found.  Put them on a subscribe and save, and save even more!  They are sharp and work well</li>
            <li> Left to their own devices, the Gillette Fusion could end global hunger and bring world peace. Had they been around there would have been no WWI or II.</li>
            <li> I want to buy this now but it&#x27;s tough find these.</li>
            <li> sprinkling some rubbing alcohol over your blades after you done shaving will make this the last pack that you&#x27;ll ever have to buy for like 5 years. The alcohol eats the water that causes tiny bits of rust to form on the blades, and that&#x27;s what shortens blade life.&lt;br /&gt; good luck.</li>
            <li> Timely delivery, and was as expected.</li>
            <li> My favorite manual shaver for once a week. I use my Philips electric razor during the week to keep up, and always use my Gilette on Sunday nights for the work week.</li>
            <li> I have a tough beard.  This is the first shave system to give me close comfortable shave without nicks and scratches.</li>
            <li> Product delivered as promised. A good value compared to retail costs.</li>
            <li> they really dot last long. one blade only lasted me one week. the ad on tv said it would cost me 52.00 a year at the price u sell the blades it going to cost me alot more then that</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s no secret razor blade cartridges are outrageously expensive. That&#x27;s why the handle itself with 1 cartridge is always cheap--where they get you is on the replacement cartridges. I bought the batch of 12, it came exactly as advertised. Not sure why some people had bad experiences and gave 1 star ratings; the ones I got are definitely legitimate. Comes in a little white box with the Gillette logos all over. 3 sets of 4 cartridges. Much more cost efficient than buying a pack of 4 or 8 retail.</li>
            <li> Great product.  I use it to shave my head.  The long razers take less times to cover my head.  I love it.</li>
            <li> Expensive but the best</li>
            <li> Very pleased. Love them.</li>
            <li> Real blades and cheaper than anywhere else.</li>
            <li> The Gillette fusion manual men does not make me have rushes, because it is smooth on edge. But the powered one is very rough and will give you a lot of bumps on your chin</li>
            <li> So glad I bought this on a refill cycle. No more, &#x27;I&#x27;m out of razors!!&#x27; No more paying too much at a store because a blade is dull and the box is empty. One less worry and no more complaints. Good all around.</li>
            <li> fake! (razors in the box even different as shown on the box)</li>
            <li> I have used most of the Gillete series of razors going back to the Sensor. I have found the Fusion blades to be the best of the bunch. I have tried the newer Proglide Fusion blades, but personally don&#x27;t think they are worth the extra money. In fact, I think the Proglide blades tend to dull faster. I also opt for the manual blades as I didn&#x27;t notice a difference when using the power blades, which are a bit more expensive. Thanks to Amazon for frustration free (and less) packaging!</li>
            <li> As expected and cheaper than the Navy Commissary.  I&#x27;ve tried the Schick multiblade razors and they feel dull and used right out of the box; they left my face very red and sore.  Gillette blades are definitely superior.</li>
            <li> So you already love the brand and the great shave that these blades give you: now you are looking for a reasonable price for the refills, which is the next part of your journey!  We have searched and right now, the Subscribe and Save offers the best price compared with our local stores.  We love the minimum and non-plastic packaging that Amazon offers: all green and all good for the family budget.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I actually bought these for my husband.  These happen to be the only razors out there that don&#x27;t cause him any irritation after shaving.  Amazon also had the best price online or compared to the stores in my area.</li>
            <li> Being in the military we have to shave often, and being black, I get razor bumps (our hair is curly and when you cut it, it regrows under the skin causes irritating bumps also visibly unsightly) so this razor along with the battery powered razor helps reduce razor bumps greatly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those looking to buy, buy a 4 pack and they should last a year, that green strip doesn&#x27;t really mean anything at all, you can put on whatever aftershave or lotion on your face when that wears out, and you are not Chuck Norris, your hair doesn&#x27;t damage the blades, what damages the blades are the minerals in your tap water. So just get a 50 cent bottle of alcohol to rinse the blades after you are done shaving, and this product will last you a while. Just think how often do you sharpen your lawn mower? And sometimes those blades nick cement!</li>
            <li> These blades are counterfeit!  I alternated daily between these blades and the identical blades purchased from Walgreens.  It took only 3 shaves for the blue strip on these to be worn off, versus 9 shaves with the same blade from Walgreens.  Shaves were all in the shower at the same time of day with the same shaving cream.  They are just plain fakes.  I tried this test with 4 of these blades, and the same result happened every time.  They are just plain fake!</li>
            <li> I have used Gillete for over 50 years and these are the best blades yet. Wouldn&#x27;t use any others. Outstanding</li>
            <li> The best for now.&lt;br /&gt;I love it.&lt;br /&gt;Comfortable and easy to use,&lt;br /&gt;Lasts very long time and it appeared the cheapest shaving cartridge.</li>
            <li> I have been using gillette products for 40 years. These Fusion blades do not klast 5 shaves the green strip turns white and the blades are not that sharp. You get about 5 good shaves and then forget it.&lt;br /&gt;I am moving to an electric shaver because these blades don&#x27;t last like previous blades from 2 years ago that Gillette made.&lt;br /&gt;They are expensive and they do not give yu many shaves.</li>
            <li> Schick and Gillette... Hydro vs. Fusion.  I love them both and alternate between them on a monthly basis for the same \\&quot;feel\\&quot; is very different between the 2 brands.  Prices are comparable.  I&#x27;m a big fan of both and the price here on Amazon was by far the best i saw in a long time.</li>
            <li> Good value. Seem to work fine.</li>
            <li> Price is ok. No complaints from the husband or grandson so I assume they are pleased at always having a new blade when needed.</li>
            <li> I bought theses with the hopes of saving some cash and for my surprise it turned out that these razors are cheap Chinese knock off brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These blades will cut your face and only last about a week - if you are lucky. Even with a new blade you can feel the difference and after you have shaved, take a good look at your face and you will see and feel the pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stay away!!!! All those 5 stars reviews are probably Chinese working for the knock off company.</li>
            <li> Thank you guys.&lt;br /&gt;It was delivered quickly and really good quality.&lt;br /&gt;I an using Gillette long time over 15 years.&lt;br /&gt;I love Gillette product line, Gillette Fusion is my favorite.</li>
            <li> KNOCK OFF IT APPEARS GENUINE GILLETTE BLADES ARE BLACK AND GREY WHICH IS THE COLOR OF THESE GREY. IT HAPPENS WHEN YOU ORDER THIS 12 COUNT BUT WHEN YOU ORDER 4-8 NO PROBLEM</li>
            <li> These blades are excellent and are at a much better price than box stores, etc.  Would purchase them again.  I also had the good fortune of purchasing when Gillette had a coupon, so really made for an excellent bargain.</li>
            <li> way cheaper than the stores. Same great blades.</li>
            <li> These Razor&#x27;s are the best of the best.</li>
            <li> These come quarterly and are a great value.</li>
            <li> All as ordered and expected.</li>
            <li> Nice replacement blades, always trying to find the least expensive fusion&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> JUST WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR</li>
            <li> Love these, and what a GREAT price!</li>
            <li> hubby is happy with one also</li>
            <li> These are the read deal Gillette Fusion blades and they provide an excellent shave.  Some reviewers (old reviews I think) have said that these blades were knockoffs but that is not true.  Great price on great blades and the eco-box shipping works just fine holding the extra blade cartridges until you need to swap in a fresh blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIP: I found that storing my razor vertically with the blades down has been a tremendous help in extending the life of my blades.  They don&#x27;t get rusty like they can if you lie it horizontally or vertically with the blades up.  Try it and see!</li>
            <li> For some reason, they don&#x27;t seem to last nearly as long as others I&#x27;ve purchased from Gillette</li>
            <li> They fit and they work just fine as expected. Good product.</li>
            <li> Excellent price, especially when you set it up through the subscribe and save program and automatic delivery system! We never run out of razors now.</li>
            <li> Gillete fusion manual cartridges are the best for any kind of face. Great, nice and simple and protective.&lt;br /&gt;Would buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> Gillette Fusion Manual Men&#x27;s Razor Blade Refills in my opinion are the best razor blades on the market.  I have been using them for years with Gillette Sensitive Skin Shaving Cream as I shave my entire body, (legs, arms, underarms, butt, and these blades get the closest smooth shave without nicks and cuts.  Yes there are other blades out there, but they cut, scrape, nick and make you bleed.  The blades work the best for me.  They are very expensive, but rather than getting cuts or nicks, they are worth the price and do a great job without irritation.  I will buy them again through Amazon.com Subscribe and Save as I feel Amazon.com charges a fair price with 15% off when you have five or more Subscribe and Save items.  These Gillette Fusion Manual Men&#x27;s Razor Blade Refills are a sure buy for me again as I have been using them for years and they do a great job.  I use them on my entire body except for my face as I use an Electric Razor for that, but my body is smooth when I use these blades.  I think they are top of the line for someone who wants a smooth, close, shave without being cut or scraped.</li>
            <li> Blades are the same as in a store, but price is better. It is very convenient to get it almost next day to your door</li>
            <li> Having used it yet but I&#x27;ve purchased one before and they work great and cheaper then at the store. But definitely recommend for someone who likes shaving a lot.</li>
            <li> The product is excellent and the service and price is hard to beat. I have been using this product for more than 2 years</li>
            <li> Love these razors and have been using them for years, plus i saved a ton by getting them here! Thanks</li>
            <li> For years I have been saying these cartridges are a total rip off, but they are the best!!! Always a nice close shave an no cuts, even on a fresh blade</li>
            <li> I think these are great razor blades.  The Fusion is a good step up from the Sensor.  I also like the regular Fusion over the Fusion Power.  All that said, these blades give a close, comfortable shave and last for multiple shaves.  I use them on my head and my face and get great shaves in both areas.</li>
            <li> These multi blade Fuzion razors sound ridiculous or at least like over kill, but with my beard they cut through it like butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These were new and delivered on time if not a bit sooner.</li>
            <li> These blades might be a little more expensive than some others but they do the job without burning my skin.</li>
            <li> My husband is addicted to these blades.  I  must admit they are nice and it&#x27;s hard to use others after using these.  We have the auto ship and it&#x27;s easy to use and customize.  These are so expensive, but with Amazon we get an amazing deal and since the blade doesn&#x27;t require as frequent changes and the shave lasts longer we feel we are ahead.</li>
            <li> These are the best!  Do not consider the generic type - only get the Gillette brand.  Your face will thank you.</li>
            <li> These blades are long lasting (man&#x27;s face), then are demoted for another months or more (ladies legs). Great item and great price.</li>
            <li> An absolute must for those who want a close shave.  The biggest improvement of these over traditional razors is the &#x27;drag&#x27; that simply dissappears.  Shaving isn&#x27;t really a big deal, and we&#x27;re men; we can handle that slight discomfort as a cheaper razor &#x27;pulls&#x27; your hair, but we shouldn&#x27;t just because we can.  With these razors, I never experience that feeling that my stubble is being pulled before it gets cut.  I think this is an acheivement because I often have to shave twice with cheaper razors, and I only have to shave once with these.  I am sure there are premium competitors that might do the trick, but Gillette is never standing still.  They keep improving.  The downside to a closer, less irritating shave is, of course, the premium price.  I can&#x27;t fault a business for stressing the premium nature of their product, but I do wish they were cheaper.</li>
            <li> Timely shipment, excellent price and genuine product.</li>
            <li> Very good. A correct quantity in this package and a good price. I will buy more packages in the future.</li>
            <li> I need razors, you know. Sure I could go retro and get a straight razor and strop but I don&#x27;t give a s*** about it. Society says I shouldn&#x27;t look like a total hobo at work so I shave, sometimes. These are fine razors but they&#x27;re so overpriced. It&#x27;s a racket and I respect it, wish I was involved. So I hate being razors. You can gussy them up with all the high tech whohas and futuristic colors and names but in the dark they all shave the same. Amirite?!?!!</li>
            <li> PROS:&lt;br /&gt;1. Good quality razors, for my wife, daughter, and myself.&lt;br /&gt;2. Price is reasonable, if you are on subscribe &amp; save plan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;1. Pricey if not using Amazons \\&quot;Subscribe &amp; Save\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;2. Can find cheap at your local discount stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used Amazons Subscribe and Save for the easy of use since my family uses razors at a regular interval. I hate shopping at the brick &amp; mortar discount stores.</li>
            <li> 99 percent of all the stuff i order from i love it works out for both of use .</li>
            <li> This is the best value I have found on this item. IT keeps me supplied with OEM blades for months.</li>
            <li> Good price and work well.</li>
            <li> Great price and quick to ship!</li>
            <li> These razor blades are nice, but I thought that they were the gillette fusion proglides...because the pictures have gillette fusion proglide written on them.  Bought the wrong ones because they looked like what I wanted, but the picture of the package was deceiving. These are actually the regular gillette fusion blades.</li>
            <li> If you use these replacement heads this is your best buy.</li>
            <li> Gillette is the best.  Don&#x27;t let dollar shave club fool you.</li>
            <li> There really isn&#x27;t much like shaving your face with a brand new razor. It feels so nice. Unfortunately, these razors are very expensive, and I have looked into Dollar Shave Club as an alternative. I may go in that direction next time, but for this time I utilized my subscribe + save account to couple these with some other items to attain a discount. It didn&#x27;t hurt the wallet quite as bad that way, and now I get to use a fresh blades for a while to shave with.</li>
            <li> great price and convenient</li>
            <li> As always,too expensive</li>
            <li> Super deal! Very fast and consistent.</li>
            <li> I have been buying these for myself and my boyfriend for as long as they have been produced. The blade is sharp and gives a close shave. I have purchased these multiple times on amazon since it has the best deal.</li>
            <li> These arrived quickly and new (as expected) and I think they are ridiculously priced by Gillette, but this is the best price I&#x27;ve found them for. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with this product. While I got it at a great price when compared to buying retail from Costco, this purchase wasn&#x27;t worth it. The blades and lubrication strip are pretty trashed after 2-3 days. You&#x27;ll be lucky to get 4-5 days out of these blades. While Costco has priced their product a few dollars more, my past experience shows me I&#x27;ll get at least twice as much out of each blade when compared to these blades. I also question whether or not these are genuine Gillette Fusion blades. Buyer beware.</li>
            <li> Just do it , I did!&lt;br /&gt;Lee</li>
            <li> Last longer dont have to worry to buy it many times</li>
            <li> These blades are identical to the ones I&#x27;ve been paying twice as much for at Walmart or the drug store.</li>
            <li> great razor at a great price</li>
            <li> It works, enough said.</li>
            <li> Good blades...but too pricey. Other brands do the job as well for half the price.</li>
            <li> What can I say.....good blades!</li>
            <li> These are the Best razors!</li>
            <li> Much better.  I brought a bulk set last time, and they seemed dull and like they were tugging while i shaved.  I threw them away and brought these - and it is so much better.  Sharp, has the 1 blade to trim and the 5 blades to give a close shave (heck i sound like their commercial).</li>
            <li> This shipped in a 100% frustration free package in a little paper box, unlike the burglary proof plastic-sealed retail cases you find locked up behind glass in your local store that treats you like a would-be shop-lifter. For as long as I live in the US, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy razor blades any other way again; this is perfect.</li>
            <li> Best shaves I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> They are the same as in the store, but more reasonably priced. My shave is comfortable &amp; close. Only nicks I get I do to myself by moving the blade incorrectly. So they are rare.</li>
            <li> Lives up to the advertisement one refill lasts me up to a month of comfortable close shaves.</li>
            <li> The 12 pack seems like a descent deal.  They last a good amount of time.</li>
            <li> I will definitely buy this item again.</li>
            <li> These have been my razor blades of choice for many years.  They shave me smoothly and closely and they last for weeks of daily shaving before they start to &#x27;grab&#x27; my beard.  The &#x27;glide strip&#x27; does serve a useful function in smoothing out the stroke.  Of course it won&#x27;t take the place of a good shave cream or foam.  These Gillette blades aren&#x27;t &#x27;cheap&#x27; but they have reliable quality and their longevity makes them a cost-effective choice for customers.</li>
            <li> These razor blades are really good.  They work perfectly on my face and prevent me from going over the same spot multiple times.  I only rated them 4 stars though due to their price.  They are basically 3 dollars per a razor blade.  Every year they seem to get more and more expensive...</li>
            <li> The package shows you advertisements for ProGlide but these are not the ProGlide razor blades. They&#x27;ll do though.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t understand why I can get 2 weeks+ shaves per blade purchased in a 16 pack from Sams and these (12 pack) barely give me a weeks shave.  Same label, water, shave cream etc. puzzeling.</li>
            <li> Like others have said, the cartridges are way too expensive and wear out much faster than they should. But for the first time since I started shaving almost 20 years ago, I can finally say I&#x27;ve found a comfortable shave. I&#x27;ve been using Gillette products for several years now, always switching to the latest product. Each one improved on the comfort over the prior, with the possible exception of the &amp;#34;power&amp;#34; versions over their &amp;#34;manual&amp;#34; counterparts. But until now, I was never completely satisfied. Now I just have to wait for the next product so they&#x27;ll hopefully lower the prices on the Fusion replacement cartridges.</li>
            <li> Excillent service and works good</li>
            <li> I have been using this from shortly after it initially came out, moving from the Gillette Sensor. The difference between the two is pretty significant. These are more expensive that the Sensors are but they last you forever. I found I got maybe 4 or 5 shaves max out of the old Sensor where I can use these blades for a good month and a half before I feel the need to replace them. The added time of use more the outweighs the increase in cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The comfort of the blade is by far the best I&#x27;ve experienced. It stays nice a smooth and cut free for weeks after I start a new blade and with the Sensor I could start feeling the use on that blade after the first or second shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blade on the back I have found to be very useful which is something that, if I remember correctly, the Sensor doesn&#x27;t even have.</li>
            <li> These are very good , worth the price??? I am not convinced!!!!!</li>
            <li> These razors are excellent and are the cheapest I could find. Make sure you take care of the blades so they will last longer.</li>
            <li> The quality of the item is amazing. Gillette Fusion Cartridges rate an 10 of 10. I ownly used Gillette razors for my sentives skin.</li>
            <li> Standard Razors, just as advertised, no complaints from me. Just wish they were not so expensive but they are cheaper than WalMart</li>
            <li> seems like a good deal</li>
            <li> Great price for what you get, and shipped with the speed of the sun-chariot of Apollo. Speaking of, you&#x27;ll look smooth and beautiful, like the sun god Apollo. So you&#x27;ll have that going for you, which is nice.</li>
            <li> I find that I can use one blade for three weeks, but clearly at that time, they need to be replaced. Shop for the best per-blade price on Amazon because they have many options of assortment on these blades.</li>
            <li> Tried to save more money by switching to cheaper blades/razors, and ended up with cuts on my face and head (I shave that too).  So I switched back to the Fusion razors and will stay with them.</li>
            <li> Im in Afghanistan, and I shave every friggin day. I need alot of change outs for my gilly Fusion so I went ahead wih this pack of 12.  There is no difference between these and the 4 pack ones.</li>
            <li> I used to get crazy bad razor burn.  To avoid it, I only use these high quality blades.  I also dip the blades in 70% alcohol before using.  I also change the blade every 1-2 weeks depending on how much I shave.  No more razor burn.  It is partly due to the quality of these blades.</li>
            <li> Great to get this product in a more economical case lot, compared to retail store prices.</li>
            <li> Thank you for the prompt delivery, great product, what I expected and received. Quick delivery, good packaging. will use again. Thanks.</li>
            <li> ...the only way to buy fusion blades - great price! great product!</li>
            <li> Seems fine and as expected.</li>
            <li> These blades don&#x27;t hold an edge as well as the ones sold in retail stores</li>
            <li> These are the best razor blades I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;I take off one star for being so absurdly expensive; they should be glad I didn&#x27;t give them three stars for that alone.</li>
            <li> These are the only razor blades my husband will use.  He loves them!</li>
            <li> What are these made of?  Solid gold?  Why are they so expensive. I&#x27;m stuck buying them for my men but the prices make me mad everytime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as quality, there aren&#x27;t many complaints but I got a nasty cut when I shaved my legs with one.  Made me cranky and stung like he((.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, make sure you get the right ones for the exact model your handle is or you are stuck.</li>
            <li> They are blades. They work. They are Gillette. Not much else to say.</li>
            <li> Always happy with these blades!!</li>
            <li> Great product and a great price if you subscribe.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery and price for something used frequently/good product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE the shave I get with the Fusion blades, and it works on the powered and unpowered handle just fine. These were recommended by a dermatologist to stop ingrown hairs and razor bumps, and they do just that when used right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are just so friggin&#x27; EXPENSIVE! And do not last as long as I remember they used to. I use them very sparingly because to me... The price is downright INSANE! The handle and 2 blades cost under $10 so why is it that the refills are so expensive?!?! They cannot cost THIS MUCH to manufacture!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is like getting a $50 computer printer and then finding out that new ink costs $75 a pop! I would rather pay a high price for the handle and a lower price for the refills, ESPECIALLY in these economic times!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line:&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest finding a cheaper alternative... Otherwise... These are a great shave, as long as you are okay with taking out a mortgage on your house to afford these refills.</li>
            <li> these are a fantastic price! I have very sensitive skin and thick hair and these work GREAT but are so expensive locally.</li>
            <li> Very timely, product was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> These razors work well and smooth.  No cuts and it is a comfortable shave.  What is there not to like?</li>
            <li> Been using these exclusively for years.  Have a few wishes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish the blades lasted longer&lt;br /&gt;Wish there weren&#x27;t deformities in some of the blades to make my face feel like it is being slices by a knife.&lt;br /&gt;Wish they were cheaper.</li>
            <li> Did next expect the easy shaving compared to the Shick 3 razors. This blade lasts me almost 2 weeks. I have yet to replace for another blade.</li>
            <li> Best value! hubby loves it.</li>
            <li> I have the handle and for what they cost in the store, it really pays to get them on line. I hope they never get discountinued, I don&#x27;t think I could ever use anything else.</li>
            <li> I love these blades, I&#x27;m a girl and they work very well. I rarely get cuts.  The product came quickly.</li>
            <li> I remember reading reviews that these were not the same and I thought, how can that be and figured I would try them anyways.  They are not the same as you would be in the store.  They are definitely a different quality.</li>
            <li> Quality and delivery time meet expectations!</li>
            <li> my husband uses this razor and loves it but hard to find cartridges as new styles are coming out so we went to&lt;br /&gt;amazon</li>
            <li> I hate paying for razor blades, but if I&#x27;m gonna hate paying for something, it&#x27;s a pretty good deal to pay for these. They seem to last a really long time before getting painfully dull. As a matter fact I really can&#x27;t tell you how long they last, is long enough that when I start noticing it pulling I have to think; how long ago did I change this thing?</li>
            <li> I bitch about the price of these blades every time, but always buy them because they last so incredibly long.  Less expensive blades suck after you have used this arrangement.</li>
            <li> Took a chance and bought these. Very happy, the price is WAY better then in store prices. You get your moneys worth. Still have a few left too and I cant remember when I bought these.</li>
            <li> These were the best price I could fined for the 12 pack which is still expensive. These also work in the pro razor with the battery and are the same except the color so don&#x27;t pay the extra money. Going to check Sam&#x27;s Club next time I go out, heard they have a 24 pack????</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t have to go out lasts quite a while and he has a heavy beard and requires a lot more time shaving burns up the blades</li>
            <li> Best price I can find anywhere even though you need to buy in bulk.  Product is great and gives a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> these work great, but we all want to save money. guys check out YOUTUBE on better shave and save life of blades. me i use the just place head of blade in some soap water just to cover head, alse sharpen blade with  jeans a old pair move blade up ,pushing forward like 10 times no need to press hard  . my blade last about 2 months . i shave each day</li>
            <li> If you are going to use a cartridge razor, these are a great product for a great price. However, I now use a double-edged safety razor and really enjoy the ritual of it all.</li>
            <li> This was my last purchase of these high priced blades. My recommendation is to buy an old fashioned double edge razor and experiment with double edged blades from various makers until you find one that you like. You&#x27;ll save a bunch.</li>
            <li> Helps to get these blades at a better price.</li>
            <li> good product and price</li>
            <li> yes I seem to be great for the priceI have only use one so farbut you can get the same at Costco</li>
            <li> The blades shipped fast and came as described.I have bough this same style of blade before (for years) and this order seems to not quite as close shaving or sharp as the previous ones I had.&lt;br /&gt;But they are working.</li>
            <li> It is ok but it feels like blades are getting dull to fast , and for that price they shouldn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> Very convenient and $$$ was good</li>
            <li> Everyone seems to be going to the &amp;#34;safety razor&amp;#34; shaves these days, but I haven&#x27;t been able to bring myself to move away from the Fusion.  The price is definitely high, but it provides a very nice, comfortable, extremely close shave without the fiddling of a safety razor system.  And the blade on the back is *FANTASTIC* for shaving under my nose.  I never have those stray hairs that I&#x27;ve seen on other people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is high, but each cartridge lasts about a week, and simply provides the best shave money can buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another tip: You can get extra life out of the cartridges by shaving backwards along your forearm 25 to 50 strokes when it starts getting rough.  I&#x27;ve used a single cartridge for up to 2 months that way.  It&#x27;s not &amp;#34;like new&amp;#34;, but it definitely takes the scratchy edge off the shave and makes it reasonable.  I typically do it now when it&#x27;s time to change the cartridge but I forgot to before I got in the shower.</li>
            <li> Expensive for what one gets in return.</li>
            <li> Misleading, It&#x27;s not bad, but for whom doesn&#x27;t know the difference between Fusion and Fusion Proglide. Although the title says Fusion, but the picture shows the Fusion Proglide label. The package is the same, when I opened it, the label says Fusion Proglide, but there are 12 Fusion cartridges in the box!!!</li>
            <li> They are what they are.</li>
            <li> Great razor, great shave. Do not need the extra blade for trimming sideburns it does not seem to work at all. Not worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> Great blades.  To make them last VERY long, just take your thumb and give the blades a downward wipe or two to clean them off after shaving and rinsing them.  Most blades that get thrown out are not dull, they are just dirty.  Clean them properly and they will last at least three times as song.  I get 6 weeks to two months from each blade, easily.</li>
            <li> The razors do not seem as sharp as they should, they seem to be after market, or poor quality imitations.</li>
            <li> Not much to say here.  They work great - as expected.</li>
            <li> They are everything you would expect in a razor blade, at a great price. Will definitely do again.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great deal.</li>
            <li> The best Razor Blade ever used.</li>
            <li> A years worth of blades for a great price !</li>
            <li> Order was as posted but every one in 5 blades is not aligned and I get cuts from it because they are not uniform.</li>
            <li> I have purchased them before and they are 5 star in my book.  I shave my head and face with them!</li>
            <li> Just like i get in the stores, but way cheaper. These blades last me a long time.</li>
            <li> Great shave,  great price.</li>
            <li> Great deal, good price, beats every other razor (hands-down) for my husband.</li>
            <li> Great bargain for the price. Cheaper than Costco per unit.</li>
            <li> Best blades ever for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> These last a long time. Having 12 means I don&#x27;t have to think about getting more any time soon.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t tell whether these are bona fide cartridges or gray market.  The color scheme on the refills is totally different from the ones in the store.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a chick. These give me razor burn. I thought they would be extra strong/close because they are men&#x27;s razors, but they ended up just irritating my skin. Maybe this is obvious to people (duh, girl, why&#x27;d you buy men&#x27;s razors?) but it wasn&#x27;t to me.</li>
            <li> Too expensive.  Electric razor first, then use these sparingly, after, so you don&#x27;t go to the poor house.</li>
            <li> Smoother than rubbing a stick of unsalted butter on your face.</li>
            <li> Best razors on the market, but too expensive.</li>
            <li> Great deal! My husband loves his Gillette Fusion and these blades. To be honest, as I woman, I love them too. Nice, clean shaven legs. The blades last quite awhile!!</li>
            <li> These razor refill cartridges were priced reasonably and get the job done.  NO more hairy legs in this house!  Will order more soon,</li>
            <li> These are not the same quality of store bought blades, in my opinion. Packaging looks legit, but the blades are not sharp and the goo above the blades is not fresh. Not very pleased with the item and would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> These beat the dollar save club prices when you subscribe and having razors delivered to your house is pretty incredible. Buying from the store these razors are a bit pricey for what you are getting, but delivered to you they can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> Same as the ones found in the storm, but about 2 dollars cheaper than what we pay for the equivalent package at Costco.  They come packaged in a plain white box, but the internal blister pack of cartridges are the same as what we get at the store.  You basically are saving by buying in bulk and not getting all the brand name packaging.</li>
            <li> Not that much better than a 2,3, or 4 bladed razor</li>
            <li> My husband loves these razor blades. Uses them until they are totally dead. They cut so much better than disposable razors!</li>
            <li> Very good blades this time.</li>
            <li> Men and women users of Gillette Fusion, Mach 3, &amp; Sensor blades/shaving systems, the price you pay for these products is outrageous and not worth the money you paid for them.  If your looking for a quality shave please read this review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have owned every Gillette produced shave system, from the Sensor to the Fusion type blades and I will be totally honest, The best that worked for me was the Mach 3 (I shave a lot, I am in the military and have been for twenty years) with this said I had a friend that convinced me to return to the old school single blade double edge safety razor and after a little bit of a learning curve, I now get the best shave that I ever recieved from any manual style razor system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I calculated blade costs for a year:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gillette Fusion $190.32 (per year with blade change out every week)&lt;br /&gt;Derby double edge razor blade: $10.40 (per year with blade change out every three days)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: When using double edge safety razor blades every blade reacts differently to each individual.  You will have to research to see what works best for you.  For this reason the price/cost savings may differ.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have thoughts of changing your shave style I highly recommend watching the enormous amount of videos on You Tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please understand that using a double edge safety razor will take you 3 times longer to shave with vice the Fusion or the other Gillette blades stated above .  For a newbie it will take around a half hour (the time will reduce once you get used to using this style of shaving).  If your a die hard Gillette fan please understand that Gillette does still have double edge razor blades for sale (they are made and sold by their overseas company) and they used t produce a lot of double edge razors and they still can be found amongst the vintage market.  Good luck I hope my review helps someone.</li>
            <li> I have used Gillette razors and blades all my life and the Fusion razor and blades work well for me.  Buying them in the 12 pack really saves me money.</li>
            <li> It was well packaged and what we wanted so thank you.</li>
            <li> I have used the Gillette Fusion blade for years and it gives a smooth and close shave even after multiple uses.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend these blades.</li>
            <li> Nice to know that I don&#x27;t have to worry about going to the store; always have what I need especially for the summer time.</li>
            <li> I am impressed with the flexibility of the razor, and it gave a really close shave. Let my skin baby soft. I am hairy and it is hard to get close shaves. These blades are great. I have bought a set after I received my free sample from Gillette. This is my new razor/blades. Way better than the Mach 3</li>
            <li> These blades are super sharp but easily glide across my face. Much better than the 2 blade disposable I have been using.</li>
            <li> Thanks Gillette for the blades. Its like shaving all over again, but without all the cuts and nicks. I am a happy guy again.</li>
            <li> I received two Fusion razor cartridges from Gillette to try for free. Each cartridge had five blades, which at first sounds like it would make the razor too large to use on your face, but I was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was to shave with this razor. (There is a single razor on the back of the cartridge for close quarter trimming or to create clean edges and small areas.) The five blades feel like they glide over my sensitive skin and did not leave razor burn or bumps. In front of the five razors are tiny plastic flexible fins that help prep your hair before the razors remove it. Following the razors is a lubricating strip that lets you know when it is time to replace the cartridge. My first cartridge lasted a week before it needed to be replaced. Overall, this razor left my face clean and smooth without razor burn or bumps. I would give it a 10 out of a 10, and I easily recommend it to my friends!</li>
            <li> Have had this razor for many years, and I love it.  Blades at the stores are expensive, much better option to buy them online.  There were cheaper ones, but these are basically Gillette&#x27;s brand and I trust it for the closeness of the shave.</li>
            <li> My father likes these, so I order them for him.  For myself I use the bargain brand and find they work just as well.</li>
            <li> Used a coupon. Best price ever. This will last me almost a year. Great value!</li>
            <li> When I got the blades the packaging was fine. Inside the blades were all soggy with a gummy fluid on it. Had to throw them all away.</li>
            <li> Delighted with my purchase.  The razor blades arrived as described by the Seller and it arrived ahead of schedule.  Couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> Gillette does make the best blades. They are too expensive and they don&#x27;t last but three shaves but that&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> I have to write some stuff in here, because this thing wouldn&#x27;t submit unless I write some text in here.</li>
            <li> Works great. The razor blades are the original product in the original  packaging. Make sure not to get the electric if you dont need.</li>
            <li> The men in my family swear by the shaving system that these catridges support.&lt;br /&gt;They say it is the greatest ever...so I suggest men TRY IT!</li>
            <li> The blades do not provide for the smoothest cut.  I didn&#x27;t realize until now I had been using a slightly better line of Gillette Fusion blades.  This cuts a little rough but still manageable.</li>
            <li> The Gillette Fusion cartridges give an excellent shave, and you&#x27;re getting a pretty good price break by buying the 12 count package. All in all, a good deal on a great razor.</li>
            <li> My favorite razor blades! Work well and last a long time.</li>
            <li> Always gets these when they go on sale.  Easy to replace heads on fusion products.  The blades last a long time and don&#x27;t get clogged with hair.</li>
            <li> I always get a great shave with the Gillette Fusion and had been buying these razor cartridges from a local store up until last week when I noticed I could get them online for a lot less.</li>
            <li> This razor is the biggest secret! I think because of the price it scares people off. It has never EVER knicked me. The best part is I go 6 months between changes and I shave every day. Has a trimmer blade on the other end that&#x27;s really good for small places.</li>
            <li> Best deal I could find.</li>
            <li> Good price for refills</li>
            <li> Prompt delivery, quality blades/</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t get into tight places, like under the nose, and cut myself more than with any other razor. I dumped the razor and all the blades and went back to the gellette fusion, it does a much better job.</li>
            <li> The packaging indicated that the blades were Fusion ProGlide, which is what I wanted. These do not appear to be what I wanted. The blades appear to be the Fusion ProGlide Power. That is not what the description says they are supposed to be.</li>
            <li> Great price with no-frills packaging.</li>
            <li> These are awesome. I don&#x27;t get all the hype surrounding &amp;#34;single blade&amp;#34; companies. I can each cartridge for a month or more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently received this product as part of a BzzAgent promotion, to try out the Gillette Fusion craze. Pleased to say, this is the best razor cartridge I&#x27;ve ever had the chance of trying out. Typically, when I use a razor, my neck explodes into a rashy, bumpy mess. It itches, and for days I have to live with the irritation, but these blades have literally changed everything around for me. They&#x27;re fantastic, and I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s because of the lubrication strip, or just the blades, but when I use these, I have absolutely no irritation on my neck. No razor burn, and barely even a scrape. All four blades are super-sharp, all the way till the end, and they&#x27;ve typically lasted me about 10 really perfect shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The precision trimmer is my favorite part of the product, assisting me in &#x27;squaring&#x27; off the back of my neckline&#x27;s hair. Even my sideburns and even the occasional unibrow is nothing for the trimmer. While it&#x27;s super sharp, it&#x27;s also quite gentle, in case anybody was thinking about &#x27;manscaping&#x27; with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I loved the individual product, and the subscription feature is just as amazing. I&#x27;m used to buying an 8-pack for the same price they&#x27;re charging for a 12-pack, and I had to drive out and hunt down the best deal at my local supermarket, target, or drugstore. Now I can easily set up a recurring payment schedule, and never have to worry about hoarding razor cartridges when I find an exceptionally lucrative deal on them.</li>
            <li> My only problem with Gillette blades are the price.  Oh well...there in business to make more money for Procter &amp; Gamble, and so much better than other brands.</li>
            <li> Delivered on time. Have been using this for a while and works out good for me.</li>
            <li> This is only a review of the refills, not a of the Fusion razor system.&lt;br /&gt;Buying refills in quantity is nice, besides the cost savings, because of less plastic packaging found in local retail stores.&lt;br /&gt;Actually, there is no outer plastic packaging when purchased like this and there is no hassle cutting them open.&lt;br /&gt;There are still too much plastic waste in the cartridge casing, though.</li>
            <li> Just what you&#x27;d expect! Comes in a nice storage container as well with a lid to keep the dust away. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Several dollars less expensive than BJ&#x27;s.  Also BJ&#x27;s quit carrying them, possibly discontinued this type of blade.  Probably break even if you don&#x27;t have Amazon Prime.</li>
            <li> Thanks for a great product !</li>
            <li> Very happy with my new Gillette Fusion. It looks nice and is priced right. Offered a very close and smooth shave and was easy to handle. The added trimmer was a big bonus! Helped trim around my mustache perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;The cartridges last a really long time and are easy to replace. I got several shaves out of one cartridge. The price is comparable to other replaceable cartridges but I really feel like I got more use out of this one compared to other brands. Highly recommend this razor!</li>
            <li> My husband has been using these for years. For a while, he tried the mail order kind that has been advertised recently (dollar shave club), but returned to using this product.</li>
            <li> These blades provide me with 5-8 good shaves before they need to be replaced...much better than the lifespan of my old safety razors.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, no doubt.  Almost everyone agrees these are great products. The beef is always with the price. Don&#x27;t you love paying $4 per cartridge?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s well established that drying the blades will HUGELY extend the life of the cartridge. Some users reports the blade can last 10x longer.  There&#x27;s several ways to do that, but here&#x27;s my trick, which I believe is the easiest as well as the cheapest:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;► After shaving, blow air to remove excess water from the blades (you probably already do that.)  Then--gently wipe a small alcohol \\&quot;prep pad\\&quot; on the blades. These are those little pads used to swab an area of skin (for example if you have to give yourself insulin injections.)  Here&#x27;s a few options, but you can pick them up very cheap at any store:&lt;br /&gt;+ [[ASIN:B00D7JKFK6 Alcohol Prep Pads]]&lt;br /&gt;+ [[ASIN:B000RFSB9A Kendall/Covidien Alcohol Prep Pads - #6818 - 1/Box of 200]]&lt;br /&gt;+ [[ASIN:B004Q6X1E6 Special Sale - 5 Boxes of 200 - WEBCOL Alcohol Prep Pads KND6818 KENDALL HEAL... MP-KND6818 Box]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trick is this: the alcohol quickly dries out any moisture. These alcohol pads cost about 2 cents apiece.  Let&#x27;s see, 2 cents per swab, $4 for cartridge ... Even I can do the math.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;√ Let me know how it works for you. But don&#x27;t tell Gillette we&#x27;re on to them.</li>
            <li> I use these blades to shave my head. I have a beard and I do a little trimming on my upper cheeks and that&#x27;s about it. These blades last a long time. I shave my head three days a week and go against the grain. I also use the same blade for my chest as well. Very nice sharp blade and glides very well. Make sure you dry the blade after use to make it last longer. I ordered 12 of these blades and don&#x27;t expect to be ordering anymore until the end of 2015.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re what you&#x27;d expect.  I think these sorts of things are overpriced.  The product is the same as what you get at the store anyway, just in bulk.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best razors I have ever used. I grew my beard out 2 weeks before trying this out for the first time. Normally when I use my regular razor that would spell trouble for my face. I would have to trim my beard down with clippers first and then shave. Not with the fusion. It was able to handle a thick beard with ease and get closer than my regular razor on just the first shave. Very Impressed! This razor came with 2 cartridges that have 5 blades on them. Initially I thought this might be overkill, but boy was I wrong. I have never had as close of a shave as when I used the Gillette Fusion razor. I highly recommend this blade!!</li>
            <li> It is so easy to switch cartridges. I am so glad I got to try this product it&#x27;s amazing and easy to use</li>
            <li> This is my first time using this razor and I&#x27;m quite impressed. I&#x27;m so accustomed to the occasional nick here and there but the shave with this razor is so smooth, I think those are a thing of the past. New cartridges are easy to install.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only and very minor comment is that the trimmer blade on the backside could be slightly smaller which would make it really great for getting at those tough to reach / more precision areas.</li>
            <li> Gillette was nice enough to send me a free sample. I used the Gillette Fusion during my normal shaving over the course of 2 weeks The cartridges give a nice close shave. I personally think the 5 closely packed blades make it more difficult to rinse and fill up faster requiring more rinsing. Overall, it works fine. Similar to my usual brand. My biggest problem is the price. These cartridges probably cost twice what they should. The cost factored in with the average performance means that I wouldn&#x27;t be buying this product.</li>
            <li> Blades were delivered on time and fit my razor perfectly.</li>
            <li> These blades work very well at first but they don&#x27;t hold their sharp edge like other blades I use.</li>
            <li> Besides the fact you save money on these it was shipped and delivered in two days!!! Win win</li>
            <li> Got these for a great deal! They are so expensive to buy in the stores. We also have made the switch to Dorco razors. They are great too, and cost 1/8th of what the gillette do!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I had found these on line and saved a few bucks since as a Prime member I get free shipping and no tax.  That said, the Blades shave really close and smoothly...and they should, for the money Gillette rips us for on their product.  The thing is, the blades last anywhere from 6 to 8 days before having to replace.  It&#x27;s true that I have a coarse beard, but the cost on these equates to around $200.00 per year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have searched for years, trying this product and that for a close shave at a more reasonable cost and it isn&#x27;t Schick.  Gillette definetly puts out a quality product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER,my search these many years,( I am 60), has finally come to fruition with a better quality, better shave, and reasonable cost compared to the outrageous prices that Gillette gets for their product.  Ordinarily I don&#x27;t promote other companies products in these reviews, but Gillette&#x27;s been getting fat and rich off of us for years because they didn&#x27;t have any serious competition...until now!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have discovered &amp;#34;Harry&#x27;s&amp;#34;.  German made high quality, long lasting blades at about a fourth of the cost when you consider that I get a full two weeks on a blade that costs half of Gillette&#x27;s insane prices.  Get free shipping and no tax on top of that and cut your costs down to about $50.00 per year.  Visit harrys.com and check them out.  I have now been using their product for three months and am delighted to have made this discovery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So long, Gillette, I&#x27;m no longer paying your extraordinary prices, which is why I only rate you at three stars.  You&#x27;ve got a good product but you&#x27;re ripping folks off and now people have an option for a better product.  You now have real competition.</li>
            <li> My husband has been using these for years, but this is the first time we purchased them on Amazon.  They work great and arrived quickly and the price was even better than Costco!</li>
            <li> Very affordable compare to other places</li>
            <li> Awesome product. So much better pricing in Amazon than in store purchase.</li>
            <li> A truly great bargain that beats retail stores any day .</li>
            <li> I have been doing the subscribe and save on this item for a year.  It&#x27;s o good deal, and it saves me A trip to Costco or Walmart, to buy it.</li>
            <li> But I must have read the description wrong as I thought I was getting the Fusion Pro-Glide blades.  I will use them till they are gone but they are not the same as the Pro-Glide blades nor as comfortable on my skin.</li>
            <li> I got these today and hey appear to be the real thing.  I priced them at the local drug store for $41 dollars so I save a few bucks.  Definitely the best brand razor blades on the market.</li>
            <li> Yes this is simply a Razor head.  And yes it is more then you will probably need in a few years time but they are a great deal.  These cost less than getting 6 from my local stores so why not get more for your money?  Additionally I don&#x27;t know what exactly is different with these Razor heads but they seem to hold an edge for a loner time than the heads that initially came with my Gillete Razor.  If you like to not have to pay extra to buy overpriced Razor heads every few months this is a great way.</li>
            <li> Great price for genuine product</li>
            <li> I bought these thinking they were made by gillete.  the package arrived with open box and no brand name.&lt;br /&gt;do not buy</li>
            <li> I good price, but the blades do not sit fully in the razor.  Wobbly. I will try this pack and hate the idea of paying full price.  Maybe the manufacturer will read this and tweak the spec.</li>
            <li> so far so good. Usually order from Sams Club these seem to be good.</li>
            <li> My husband says there GREAT</li>
            <li> Cool just what I need</li>
            <li> best quality, hubby loves having them deliver to our door without worrying about rising prices or the stores new habits of putting them in lock boxes making u feel as if your purchasing contraband</li>
            <li> Priced better than the store, can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> The price was good the blades work great i would buy them again and recommend them to friends buy them</li>
            <li> great bulk purchase, better price! buy your baldes just once a year</li>
            <li> Use Them Daily, Great products</li>
            <li> I always thought that these companies were getting out of control with number of blades and such. This one is good, especially if you shave head or large areas. Good design-I was surprised. But the blades are pricey! If you are careful about cleaning after use they will last a bit longer. If you shave your head they are worth checking out.</li>
            <li> Such a great product!</li>
            <li> Good; cheaper than corner store purchases.</li>
            <li> I will not buy Gillette anymore. They had to have changed their formula or made it so the blades do not last as long. Probably due to all the people not shaving and profits being down. At first I thought perhaps my facial hair had gotten coarser or something caused the faster dulling but I found a pack from a few years ago in a travel bag. Used those and they lasted a LOT longer. Corporate greed.</li>
            <li> Outstanding price, I order enough for the year for extra savings.</li>
            <li> It fits my Fusion razor as stated, the product is new and it was much less than the price at Walmart. I will continue  to purchase this product from this vendor. I would highly recommend this product to anyone needing this razor.</li>
            <li> I am a LONG time user of Gillette Fusion blades.  One blade lasts me one week or 4 shaves.  There is definitely something wrong with these razors.  They do NOT arrive in retail packaging.  After one shave, the blade is dull and gives me razor burn.  I called Gillette customer service and they stated they DO NOT sell razor blades in this kind of packaging.  Are these defective blades or Chinese fakes?  Definitely not what you get at the store.  I will be returning my blades and going back to the store to purchase.  It might cost more, but at least I know they are real.</li>
            <li> These blades do the job. Shaving is a breeze</li>
            <li> works fine as the shaver itself.</li>
            <li> Great price and each of these blades last me a month.  I used cheap disposable razors for years but when I tried these I never looked back!  The only downside was the price but this deal makes them affordable!</li>
            <li> My husband likes these blades and I&#x27;ll order more.</li>
            <li> Good buy and was able to stock up easily before taking off for extended vacation out of country.</li>
            <li> The most affordable retail price for these high-end razors, not to mention a great shave.  Delivery took just a few days, much shorter than promised, plus shipping was free. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Came in a nice cardboard case so it wasn&#x27;t difficult to open which was helpful.  I&#x27;ve used these razors for years without issue.</li>
            <li> Already use these but great price on autoship, you save about 30% off the store price. My husband has been using them for 6 years now.</li>
            <li> Use the Fusion power blades if you want the best shave.</li>
            <li> These are the factory rejects. These blades do not last as long as the ones I buy in the store. Nor are they of the quality. I shredded my face about the 3rd or 4th use of the first blade. The ones I get in the store last 3 solid weeks each. I&#x27;m using one per week with these. I&#x27;ll continue  using them since I spent  the money on them but will not re-order this item.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t give a very good shave</li>
            <li> I love these blades and boy have I tried everyone there is out there to try!!! I can tell you that the Gillette Fusion blades are GREAT! They last a very long time and the cut they give you is AMAZING!!!! They are priced well and the product will not disappoint in my opinion. I recommend this product to anyone who is looking for the right priced,  well shaving and well maintained grooming product!!!!</li>
            <li> Better price than I could find anywhere. Great blades. With subscribe and save the price can&#x27;t be beat. Stock up and save when you can.</li>
            <li> Received before date of arrival.  Clean smooth shave.  Like it.</li>
            <li> best prices ive seen.bills too often.</li>
            <li> They Don&#x27;t seem to last as long as the ones I buy in the store, but they appeared​ to be legitimately packaged, just not the type of packaging I&#x27;m used to.</li>
            <li> The cartridge is the best part of this razor.  I used to dread shaving because my skin was so sensitive, by the next day razor burn...no matter what.  Not any more! Not only do I not get razor burn but I have to say I&#x27;m getting the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten without going against the grain.  The cartridge also has a unique feature.  On the back of the cartridge there is a single blade, which works wonders for getting even sideburns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason it didn&#x27;t get 5 stars is I&#x27;m a guy that doesn&#x27;t shave everyday and when I went to shave after 3 days it performed like any other razor in the fact that it would rip the hair out instead of cutting it.</li>
            <li> My husband loves his Gillette Fusion Razor and love the cartridges as well, he doesn&#x27;t tend to throw the blade away after the strip fades because he feels there is life to the blade. He loves the way the blades leave his skin, smooth and not irriated at all.  He will defintely keep purchasing the cartridges for the razor.</li>
            <li> thanks to bzzagent i am no longer a scruff. My wife has been bothering me about shaving my beard and stash for a while and i just didnt want to. Our anniversary was coming up and i wanted to bring her out for a nice dinner and i decided to surprise her. overall the razor was great. it worked nice. fit in my hand nice. good weight. the cartridge was great too. sharp and cut nice. ive used it a few times now, just to keep her happy, and its worked great. i really enjoy my razor. i just wish the blades werent so expensive. its a good razor maybe it will cut down on having to buy them so much. and i will probably go without shaving for a while ;)</li>
            <li> They give you a very nice close shave but don&#x27;t seem to last very long before they start dulling. For what they cost I would expect these blades to last a lot longer.</li>
            <li> delivered on time and as described</li>
            <li> So much more convenient than having to shop when I run out. Product is no different than what I buy in stores.</li>
            <li> Will buy more when I need them , great product great price.</li>
            <li> What do you say about razors? What I ordered. Every three months. Like clockwork</li>
            <li> they work well for me</li>
            <li> Nice price! Fast shipping!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> Great product and great deal, cheaper than buying in stores.</li>
            <li> I have ordered these a couple of times.  They are perfect.</li>
            <li> Very sharp and works great on sensitive areas. Gets very close to the skin.  Would give five stars but the razor heads are slightly expensive.</li>
            <li> When I first started using the Fusion razor I was very impressed with how it glides over the face while giving a close shave.  It was a big improvement from my old razor.  However, the price of the blades is much higher than my old blades.  If you are willing to pay the price, these blades do a good job.</li>
            <li> I am a woman and this is a mans razor , but it is the only razor I have found that leaves Everthing smooth including all the odd angled places. It&#x27;s awesome.</li>
            <li> great deal&lt;br /&gt;thank you</li>
            <li> Im an everyday shaver so I know blades.  These are great blades they just cost way to much.  Yes, I&#x27;ve tried buying them in bulk at the local big-box stores but they still cost more than I care to pay.  And I don&#x27;t like that everything a blade or handle comes out, they make the old ones harder to find.  So for &amp;#34;blades&#x27; I&#x27;ll give it 5 stars.  For the marketing, 3 stars.  There are other blades out thier that dont cost as much and dont force you to buy a handle for each and every blade.</li>
            <li> These were the worst razors I ever bought. They basically came dull. That is all.</li>
            <li> Well I am set for 2 years now as I can get 2 months out of one blade.  I would not spend the mone on these blades if they didn&#x27;t work.  they cost more then some other blades but work very well for me &amp; now I have found them here on Amazon cheaper then my local Wal-mart.</li>
            <li> Makes your face feel like a baby&#x27;s butt.  Not that anyone should be going around feeling babies&#x27;s butts, but you get the point. Work well.  Have alway been way over priced.</li>
            <li> Just what I had been looking for.  Works very well, and is reasonably priced.  Cheaper than WalMart!!</li>
            <li> Let get real guy&#x27;s the commercials are true.&lt;br /&gt;I will suck it up to pay the price of men&#x27;s razors.&lt;br /&gt;But the big hassle is trying to get beyond the security barricades.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s no wonder that beards are making a comeback.&lt;br /&gt;I have my  doubts on how intentional those hipster beards are. Somewhere out their their is photographic evidence of a guy going into Walmart to buy razors clean shaven, and coming out with a full beard. Finding a store clerk to open the case and escortiong you to the cashier...well you would have better luck finding a doorway to Narnia!</li>
            <li> I easily get 30 shaves out of each blade so it only costs me about 1 dolla a day to use this fine product. It does snag my pubes from time to time but over all I get very smooth skin</li>
            <li> I have been using these blades for years from Amazon.  They last a long time (3-4 weeks of daily shaving for each blade) and stay super sharp.  I could not be more pleased.  They are genuine Gillette blades.</li>
            <li> Cheaper than local stores and appears to be genuine Gillette product.</li>
            <li> Uncomplicated shopping at its best!</li>
            <li> Love the razor and the blades.....BUT, notice only 4 per sleeve.</li>
            <li> OK - not as good as I had hoped.  A few of my blades seemed bent or misshaped and cut me often.  Others were OK.  QC perhaps?  Again, some blades were good others I could feel cutting me on the same shave. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Closest most comfortable shave I&#x27;ve ever had. Excellent product from Gillette. Maybe a little too expensive for my taste.</li>
            <li> I even have the girlfriend using these because they&#x27;re so great.  Close, comfortable shave on what ever skin you use them on.</li>
            <li> Good way to buy razors.</li>
            <li> Hubby says they are expensive but work great. We have these auto shipped to save money. Not sure how this compares to buying at the store, but it&#x27;s one less thing on my shopping list.</li>
            <li> quality razors at the right price</li>
            <li> These razor blades are awesome but so expensive in stores.  This was a great value and an easy way to stock up!</li>
            <li> Great product and the BEST price on Amazon!</li>
            <li> A great value and a common sense schedule to receive shipments</li>
            <li> What can I say . . .brand name razor blades (not knock off copies), cheaper than you can buy them in stores.</li>
            <li> Still my favorite razors. I buy on amazon because of the savings, but the product itself does the job quite well. I definitely recommend using them with an vibrating razor. When my battery dies in my razor and I have to go that one or two shaves without that feature, I find the shave is rougher and not as good. I end up with more ingrowns that way as well.</li>
            <li> These blades last me almost 2 weeks shaving daily. Comfortable, sharp get the job done.</li>
            <li> Cheap and should last for a while</li>
            <li> You cannot find the Fusion razor blades anywhere for such a good price.  In my opinion, these are superior to all of the Fusion-types that followed.  These are the best!</li>
            <li> A good shave but seems a little hi priced</li>
            <li> This is the best price performance packaging I have found so far!!!</li>
            <li> Good deal on a product that I use, daily.  I think these are generally the most overpriced product I use on a regular basis.  However, they work great and they seem to last about four or five shaves, for me.  Generally, that computes to about $1 per day for shaving (which is kinda insane, considering you can probably pay someone to give you a shave for $5 in parts of the US.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here, with what I paid, it is closer to $.50 per day. I always end up buying the store brand razors with four or five blades that cost 1/4 the price, and end up back with these Gillette blades.  They are better - just expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t consider myself one of those, ehm, metrosexuals.  I just really like a close shave.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT SERVICE!  Thank you so very much!  Will order again!</li>
            <li> You have the best price on these. It&#x27;s Gillette that should be charged with extortion.</li>
            <li> Works good, gets most of my mustache. has the green strip for irritation and wears out so you know when to change blades.</li>
            <li> these razors are clearly imitations of the real ones,the wear out almost instantly and no matter how careul you are, you will cut your face and have ingrown hair</li>
            <li> Great value and beats all the other store prices plus is available for Subscribe and Save for the increased discount....</li>
            <li> this what I use ... they should never have run the advertisements&lt;br /&gt;showing that you need only change these blades once a month&lt;br /&gt;worst idea gillette ever made  bet they do not use that firm any longer</li>
            <li> Different color than what I expected, but who cares?  They&#x27;re razor blades, not a shirt!  Smooth shave, and I like the single blade for trimming nice lines (ie sideburns).</li>
            <li> Seems the same great blade...great price.</li>
            <li> Love em fast delivery good price.</li>
            <li> Great product, quick dispatch no complaints.</li>
            <li> These razors are seriously the best-for males and for females-there is no better razor!</li>
            <li> Les doy mi mas sincero agradecimiento por el producto que recib&amp;iacute; se los agradezco saludos desde venezuela siempre los recomiendo por tan buen servicio</li>
            <li> I went back to my old Mach III for a while to save some money and things I have noticed -- shave is much better and closer, blades last longer, skin looks great after shaving.  I also purchased directly from Amazon and didn&#x27;t have any problems of having any knock offs.  Also, the easy packaging is helpful as well.  I hate getting the big boxes and have to cut them open with concern of cutting myself.</li>
            <li> Shaving every day, you are introduced slowly to the dulling of a blade. You forget how well they shave when new. The indicator strip reminds you when to change the blade. I&#x27;ve never had a close a shave with any other product. These are pricey, but worth the money.</li>
            <li> Expensive, but they&#x27;re good.</li>
            <li> We tried Dollar Shave club but you get what you pay for.  The quality just wasn&#x27;t the same or even comparable.  These are great and with the subscription it takes the work out of ordering.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have ordered the fusion cartridges on line and they are working out just fine.</li>
            <li> The best And if you soak the in Alcohol after shave it keeps them sharp</li>
            <li> The same great razors at an exceptional price.</li>
            <li> Good price and arrived as expected.  The subscription feature is a good option for this type of item of course.</li>
            <li> Best cartridges for my husbands&#x27; beard.  Received the order days faster then stated; this made him very happy.  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> It came in just as ordered. Got to me just in time. I think it was a pretty good value. Even though I think these things are way overpriced to begin with! But I&#x27;ll purchase from here again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used all kinds of razors and these are the best I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;These beat any other name brand out there.&lt;br /&gt;With that said, I have not tried the Zilo or Dorco ones..&lt;br /&gt;Once this 12 count is used, I&#x27;ll try the Zilo&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also this works great with my engraved razor handle from the Art of Shaving.</li>
            <li> The very cheapest way to get razors.  Never have to worry about running out with this subscription.  Love every thing about it.</li>
            <li> good price, works well, just like in store. Arrived in Gillette package. I have sensitive skin but this product doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out like others.</li>
            <li> i hate buying razors because of the cost.  However, these really are priced great - at $2 less per blade than our local big-box store.</li>
            <li> Look Sharp, Feel Sharp Gillette is a great shave just like the old 1950s commercial that I saw on tv when I was young.</li>
            <li> My husband doesn&#x27;t use anything but this.</li>
            <li> I like these blades but, you know, I went to a barber in Managua, Nicaragua and had a shave with a straight razor, which is single blade, and that shave lasted for two whole days.  These blades give a nice shave, but even with 5 blades on them the shave only lasts for one day.  They are also kind of expensive per each blade.</li>
