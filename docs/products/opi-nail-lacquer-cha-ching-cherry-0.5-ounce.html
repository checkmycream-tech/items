            <li>OPI used to have a color called Calendar Girl that picked up the pinks or the oranges of my outfit and looked great with both.</li>
            <li>I always bring my own color, but this time I changed my mind!  </li>
            <li>It looks best with 2 coats and a top coat.</li>
            <li>I loved the service, also the way I was directed to assist me with my order.</li>

            <li>Love this color which seems to go with any outfit.  </li>
            <li>Love the color.</li>
            <li>I am glad I ordered it, would do it again.</li>
            <li>really is a lovely color.</li>
            <li>so I was glad to find it on Amazon for&lt;br</li>
            <li>OPI is a great nail polish and stays on very well.</li>
            <li>I love the color as represented as seen.  </li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and lasts a week or more</li>
            <li>Greatly appreciated finding my favorite color!</li>
            <li>but it is not always available retail</li>
            <li>I have found that for me, it doesn&#x27;t pay to go cheap when it comes to nail lacquer.  </li>
            <li>is good old Cha Ching.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I just love this color, it&#x27;s not too red and not too pink, a perfect blend!</li>
            <li>A true red/pink mix.</li>
            <li>Thanks for having this available.  </li>
            <li>Her nails were painted before mine, and I liked the color so much that I put mine back in my bag and asked for this one instead.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li>This is definitely more on the pink side, but the closest thing I&#x27;ve found to my old favorite.  </li>
            <li>I first saw this particular color at a nail salon.</li>
            <li>Just as stated, fast service.  </li>
            <li>Thank you so much.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>The colors are vibrant, and the paint is long-lasting.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this shipper to others.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to every one</li>
            <li>To top it off, the lady who sat in my mom&#x27;s vacant chair once she went to dry saw mine and asked for the same.  </li>
            <li>time I visit a salon and proceed to try to select a new color off the color wheel, it always turns out the color I choose</li>
            <li>It never gets old and goes with anything you want it to.  </li>
            <li>product my professional manicurist uses.</li>
            <li>OPI dries quickly enough to be convenient, but not so fast that I can&#x27;t get it</li>
            <li>I wear.&lt;br /&gt;[I am a green eyed blonde and can wear most colors except for the oranges, yellows, and browns].&lt;br</li>
            <li>it on smoothly before it starts to get thick.  </li>

            <li> I bought this so when I go to get my pedicure, I don&#x27;t have to look for the color from their display.</li>
            <li> Love love love this OPI is the best polish out there... I ordered this color for a friend but ordered one other for myself.</li>
            <li> I loved the service, also the way I was directed to assist me with my order. I would definitely order in the future for other products.  Thank you</li>
            <li> Just as stated, fast service.  Would highly recommend this shipper to others.  Would buy again.  It was just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> The best red ever in the history of nail varnish . . . Bring it back, OPI!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start by saying I have been a fan of OPI polish for quite some time. The colors are vibrant, and the paint is long-lasting. I first saw this particular color at a nail salon. My mother and I had gone together to get pedis. I always bring my own color, but this time I changed my mind!  My mom picked Cha-Ching Cherry from the wall. Her nails were painted before mine, and I liked the color so much that I put mine back in my bag and asked for this one instead.  To top it off, the lady who sat in my mom&#x27;s vacant chair once she went to dry saw mine and asked for the same.  Great polish!</li>
            <li> Great Product!!! I just love this color, it&#x27;s not too red and not too pink, a perfect blend! Always satisfied with OPI nail polish.</li>
            <li> I love this shade of OPI polish.  It never gets old and goes with anything you want it to.  I&#x27;ve been using this for many many years.</li>
            <li> I love the color of Cha-Ching Cherry polish.  When OPI announced they were discontinuing this color, I ordered 2 bottles so I can continue to use it for my mani-pedis  for a good while.  Thanks for having this available.  The packaging was great for protection of the bottles.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product and the seller shipped it in record time and with great care in packaging.  Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> Good value. .same product my professional manicurist uses. My color preference is easy to find on Amazon but next to impossible in local stores. I like to have a bottle on hand for touch ups between manicures.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite colors.</li>
            <li> I was looking everywhere for this color. It is my favorite and the nail salon did not have it anymore. The price was great and the product was excellent</li>
            <li> Greatly appreciated finding my favorite color!</li>
            <li> Love this color..... Its not too red and not orange either. Goes with everything, I have wore it for the last two years.</li>
            <li> Love this color which seems to go with any outfit.  Goes on smooth and lasts a week or more (if you take care of your hands!)</li>
            <li> Best color ever! It is terrific for all seasons and goes with everything. I highly recommend it to every one</li>
            <li> Love it!  Lasts a long time.  Love the color. I am glad I ordered it, would do it again. Thanks</li>
            <li> Love this color! Goes well with everything.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s opi, what can I say? Lots of compliments on the color. I bought two bottles,,,,,</li>
            <li> I have been using Cha Ching Cherry OPI for years.&lt;br /&gt;Every time I visit a salon and proceed to try to select a new color off the color wheel, it always turns out the color I choose is good old Cha Ching.&lt;br /&gt;I wear it all seasons and receive compliments wherever I go.&lt;br /&gt;The color is pink-cherry red, not a brown red and has a subtle sparkle. It seems to go with everything I wear.&lt;br /&gt;[I am a green eyed blonde and can wear most colors except for the oranges, yellows, and browns].&lt;br /&gt;It really is a lovely color.</li>
            <li> I have worn this color for years....but it is not always available retail so I was glad to find it on Amazon for&lt;br /&gt;a great price and it came very quickly!  Under $10 with shipping included!!</li>
            <li> OPI is a great nail polish and stays on very well. This color is one I have used for years and I still get compliments on it all the time.  A true red/pink mix.</li>
            <li> I have found that for me, it doesn&#x27;t pay to go cheap when it comes to nail lacquer.  OPI dries quickly enough to be convenient, but not so fast that I can&#x27;t get it it on smoothly before it starts to get thick.  This is a good color but it was not what I was looking for. OPI used to have a color called Calendar Girl that picked up the pinks or the oranges of my outfit and looked great with both. This is definitely more on the pink side, but the closest thing I&#x27;ve found to my old favorite.  It has a bit of iridescence that makes it easier to apply than the flat colors.  I am a bit of a clutz, and I can apply this one fairly easily so that it looks good. It looks best with 2 coats and a top coat.</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time and in as described condition.  I love the color as represented as seen.  I would recommend this product to a friend.</li>
