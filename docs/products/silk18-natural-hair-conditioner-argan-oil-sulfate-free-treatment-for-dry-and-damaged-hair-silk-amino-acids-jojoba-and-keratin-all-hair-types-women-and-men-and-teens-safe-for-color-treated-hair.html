            <li>A good choice for people wanting to keep chemicals out if their bodies and homes.</li>

            <li>I loved this silk conditioner because it made my hair softer and shinier.</li>
            <li>The package arrived in good condition</li>
            <li>Plus, I&#x27;ve also started getting tons of compliments from friends about how good my hair looks, since I started using this</li>
            <li>I loved the feel of my hair afterwards just didn&#x27;t care for the smell.</li>
            <li>Definitely a good find.</li>

            <li>In her words, she loved that the product came sealed.  </li>
            <li>I bought the sage shampoo and looked for a product from maple so as to have a good combination of products.after use , it leaves my hair softer and not feeling drained.thank</li>
            <li>The conditioner is good and silky but its like getting ketchup out of a glass bottle.</li>
            <li>it is a good product and will buy again.</li>
            <li>Good but not as extremely good as I respected.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really good.  </li>
            <li>Gorgeous.</li>
            <li>honestly works great</li>
            <li>The Silk 18 conditioner, however, is really good.</li>
            <li>Does a good job with moisturizing and as a tip</li>
            <li>The silk18 conditioner smells so good like coconut.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I did not find Silk 18 to be a good conditioner, hence the 3 stars.  </li>
            <li>It is, however, a good leave-in or curl cream type product for my hair.  </li>
            <li>This made my hair feel good, but it&#x27;s not a miracle worker.</li>
            <li>I loved the smell and the way my curly hair detangles after conditioning.</li>
            <li>Good product for the price.</li>
            <li>and it smells like vanilla so good.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for something that would be good on my color treated hair and add moisture.  </li>
            <li>I think this is a good conditioner.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>good customer service.  </li>
            <li>The smell is awesome and it leaves my hair so smooth.</li>
            <li>The vanilla scent is very pleasant and is not too strong after you rinse it off.</li>
            <li>I agree that if you stick your nose in the bottle, it is strong but if you rinse it out of your hair, I find it very pleasant.  </li>
            <li>I bought it and am very impressed with how silky rich it feels, and my tendency toward oily hair is not exacerbated which is always my fear with conditioners.  </li>
            <li>Most surprising to me is that the scent lasts for days!</li>
            <li>, I was not disappointed and the conditioner is awesome !!!!!!!</li>

            <li>Love, love, love! !!!</li>
            <li>Awesome conditioner :) :)</li>
            <li>My hair is smoother and silkier and the mild aroma of vanilla is wonderful.</li>
            <li>This conditioner is awesome for women with super frizzy, course hair.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;There&#x27;s nothing exceptional about this conditioner.  </li>

            <li>But I will say it does make hair very smooth and shiny, which feels great when the hair dries.&lt;br</li>

            <li>Love love love this conditioner!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a delicious vanilla scent that becomes more mild but still smells great over time.</li>
            <li>My hair always feels very Healthy</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t be more happy to find this product.</li>
            <li>I ordered this on a whim because the company seemed very reputable</li>
            <li>My hair feels more luxurious than it&#x27;s felt in years, and if it could, no doubt would be doing a happy dance for all the nutrients it&#x27;s now being fed with this conditioner.</li>

            <li>I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li>I have purchase Silk 18 twice now and am very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>The shampoo is great and I am so glad I bought it, but this conditioner does nothing for my hair.</li>
            <li>This conditioner smells great and leaves my hair shiny and more manageable.</li>
            <li>Thank you, we are both very satisfied</li>
            <li>Great product,  love it</li>

            <li>very pleased with the products and Maple Holistics as a seller.</li>

            <li>Very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I think part of the problem is that there is keratin in this conditioner which is great (makes hair shinier, stronger) but for some people if you use this conditioner more than once a week it will be drying for you.</li>
            <li>I have to say I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for 30 days and am very pleased.</li>

            <li>This is the absolute best conditioner I have ever used!</li>
            <li>I have been looking for an organic shampoo for awhile now, My friend recommended me to try this because she said it was nice and made her hair feel nice.</li>
            <li>or I have had a problem with my hair just seeming kind of lifeless after their use, but not with this Maple Holistics conditioner.</li>

            <li>The vanilla and honey is so nice.  </li>
            <li>The scent is nice, kind of vanilla almond.</li>
            <li>This conditioner also smells good and my kids love the smell.  </li>
            <li>so I can give an honest opinion of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This was very moisturizing and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li>Also, it make my hair (and me as a whole) smell delicious all day!</li>
            <li>the smell is really nice like vanilla my hair like a lot so now is gonna be in my list of the month</li>
            <li>I really liked it.</li>
            <li>Even if I had liked the smell to begin with</li>
            <li>However, when my hair is healthy and I take care of it, it is gorgeous.  </li>
            <li>Nice to have a product that works this well without a bunch of chemical ingredients.</li>
            <li>I could nicely run my finger through my hair.</li>
            <li>My hair kind of smells like spiced vanilla or root beer,</li>
            <li>and I am absolutely thrilled.  </li>
            <li>Nice conditioner with a nice scent.</li>
            <li>Honestly, if you&#x27;re paying a ton for any beauty product, you&#x27;re wasting your money.</li>
            <li>Nice product</li>
            <li>have been using this conditioner for 3 days now, and am thrilled.  </li>
            <li>This conditioner  is gentle and wonderful!</li>
            <li>I loved finding a conditioner that is chemical free and won&#x27;t damage my hair anymore!</li>
            <li>I have shoulder length hair that I wash with sifted rye flour (best no-poo shampoo I&#x27;ve tried) or occasionally a whole egg.</li>
            <li>A warm Vanilla smell.</li>
            <li>The formula is spectacular; the smell is enticing almost like maple syrup.</li>
            <li>Since my hair is colored I was looking for something that was both effective as a conditioner but would not strip the color.  </li>
            <li>The vanilla scent is nice, but stronger than I would like in a conditioner.</li>
            <li>Well I have a kind of wavy and somewhat curly hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a vanilla kind of person.</li>
            <li>The company ethics match my own, or I would not have bought it.</li>
            <li>My hair feels nicely conditioned and is not unruly after using silk 18.  </li>
            <li>I have no idea how this conditioner got sooo many good reviews.</li>
            <li>Not time effective.</li>
            <li>, I remember my hair was kind of damage</li>
            <li>and this works better than 90% of things I have tried, but the price is good.  </li>
            <li>This is a good product, it is one of the better conditioners i have tried.</li>
            <li>This is a nice conditioner</li>
            <li>Nice smell</li>

            <li>Smell is nice.  </li>
            <li>I really liked both the product and the speed at which the product was delivered.</li>
            <li>It has a nice vanilla scent that is not overpowering.</li>
            <li>scent is a really nice vanilla that doesn&#x27;t stick around after the shower is over; your hair will be natural-smelling once it dries.&lt;br</li>
            <li>These products are really nice for my hair.</li>
            <li>i love it my hair become good .no loss</li>
            <li>yes, it did make my hair feel nice (silky) and</li>
            <li>Absolutely the best conditioner (and shampoo)  </li>
            <li>A nice conditioner.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I didn&#x27;t have huge expectations because my experience with &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; beauty products hasn&#x27;t been great.  </li>
            <li>I am returning this product and plan to make my own conditioner using organic aloe vera from the organic plant, mixing it with water and spraying on my hair as a detangled</li>
            <li>Nice aroma, not overpowering.</li>
            <li>I really liked this conditioner.  </li>
            <li>It has leaves a nice vanilla smell in your hair and works to loosen up your hair.</li>
            <li>I think this is a nice conditioner.  </li>
            <li>It smells really nice.</li>
            <li>I liked trying shampoos and conditioner, and when I came to this silk 18</li>
            <li>I used this conditioner today and I really liked it.</li>
            <li>I honestly bought this because it was on sale</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a honest conditioner to my frizzy brittle hair</li>

            <li>SO nice- like vanilla.</li>
            <li>I found a product I really liked</li>
            <li>I found it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tentatively added nothing to my hair after conditioning - no oils or &#x27;defrizzing&#x27; agents - to see how Silk 18 would hold up on its own.</li>
            <li>It smells nice and my comb just glides through my hair when I apply it</li>
            <li>my hair feels very silky after but not oily- its a great balance!</li>
            <li>really nice .I</li>
            <li>Excellent product and fast service.  </li>
            <li>A lot of conditioners I have tried leave a &amp;#34;film&amp;#34; which feels kind of greasy even after rinsing.</li>
            <li>Even my boyfriend told me my hair looked exceptionally nice the day I used the conditioner.</li>
            <li>since I know this is an honest company now.</li>
            <li>That really shows what a great product this is!</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money-- and the best part, it smells fantastic!</li>
            <li>My mother owns her own beauty salon</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m loving the results.  </li>
            <li>I leave on my hair for like 30mins before I rinse with warm water</li>
            <li>Thrilled that I found this product.</li>
            <li>Nice conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Aubrey Organics Island Naturals or Honeysuckle Rose Conditioner.</li>
            <li>Got a good quality argan mask on Amazon that was a bazillion times better.   </li>
            <li>this was so nice my friend took it.excellent for damaged hair</li>
            <li>I used it one time and honestly have never had any conditioner ever be as nice as this one.</li>
            <li>as it does smell nice and does a hell of a job.</li>

            <li>I just made sure I massaged it in good,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thrilled to have found this product.</li>
            <li>Product rinses out nicely.  </li>
            <li>I have medium length hair, so I kind of have to use a lot for it to feel fully conditioned.</li>
            <li>I really liked the result</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m loving it.</li>
            <li>It was about as good as most conditioners from the drug store.</li>
            <li>I really liked this conditioner.  </li>
            <li>It seems to works incredibly well, and I loved how soft my hair was and how it looked afterwards, but the hair loss horrified and disturbed me!!!</li>
            <li>This conditioner is very good, but I didn&#x27;t feel the silkiness right out of the shower, like I would if I used some of the chemical-ridden conditioners.</li>
            <li>First use and I already see AMAZING RESULTS!!</li>
            <li>It is light, yet very effective.  </li>
            <li>This is a wonderful conditioner, love it and it smells like pure vanilla!</li>
            <li>I am happy to say I am was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price!!!</li>
            <li>definitely worth a try!!!</li>
            <li>I rarely stick to one product, but this is a must!!!</li>
            <li>The ingredients are great and it has a nice rich, creamy consistency that&#x27;s very easy to apply to my curly hair.</li>
            <li>It has a wonderful smell and I could not believe how much better my hair felt after the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>Great product, makes my hair feel silky and clean.  </li>
            <li>I find the scent very mild and pleasant.  </li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;m not a fan of the very strong warm vanilla smell after that ...</li>
            <li>smells awesome, and my hair is so silky and soft!!  </li>
            <li>It has amazing slip and best of all, it&#x27;s a natural conditioner!</li>
            <li>Love the feel of it, nice and creamy, the smell is awesome but not too much (vanilla scent).</li>
            <li>It makes my hair so silky smooth and smells like warm vanilla sugar!</li>
            <li>It smells lovely (like coco butter) and leaves my hair very smooth!</li>
            <li>It smells great, like a sweet almonds.</li>
            <li>Smells very nice too, a clean vanilla smell.</li>
            <li>This conditioner sounded too good to be true, but I thought at this point it couldn&#x27;t get any worse-could it?!</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s better because it&#x27;s sulfate free and made with so many good ingredients for your hair!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with my new conditioner.</li>
            <li>- the new shampoo he sent me was perfect for my hair type.  </li>
            <li>It is great that it is free of so may toxic chemicals that are in most conditioners.</li>
            <li>The smell is wonderful (it could even be stronger for me, but it&#x27;s a nice soft scent).</li>
            <li>For the price, it is a good, strong product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried just about every kind of conditioner under the sun and this one is by FAR the best with both quality and price.</li>
            <li>The pleasant smell, the consistency, and the silkiness of my hair after use is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Smells great and serves to detangle, but does not yield any extraordinary result.  </li>
            <li>Pleasant vanilla scent is light and not overly perfumed.</li>

            <li>Often I would cause even more damage by straightening it, and then proceeding to curl it to avoid frizz.</li>
            <li>if this worked on my hair texture, I feel extremely confident in saying that you should not be worried about encountering yet another dud</li>
            <li>This conditioner doesn&#x27;t seem to offer many benefits for my hair.</li>
            <li>I love the way my hair smells after I use this.  </li>
            <li>I love this conditioner.  </li>

            <li>This conditioner works wonders:)</li>
            <li>I love this conditioner.</li>
            <li>It has a delicious smell and leaves my hair feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>But it does make it softer which I love. :)</li>
            <li>It felt better than I can ever remember.</li>
            <li>I bought this hoping it would make my hair more moisturized.</li>
            <li>I Love it ..</li>
            <li>This conditioner is ok.</li>

            <li>It gets better by the week</li>
            <li>just in one use you will fall in love.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure with all my experience of Conditioners</li>
            <li>I am able to comb it and the frizzyness is no where to be seen.</li>
            <li>Good good conditioner, I have tried  Kerastase Nutritive Bain Satin 2 Complete Nutrition products, Moroccan products but these conditioner is the one for my frizzy, damage hair, split ends.</li>
            <li>I came across this product and decided to give it a try, and I&#x27;m glad that I did.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I love the smell</li>
            <li>and I love the ingredient list</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t love how my hair feels during and after using it.</li>
            <li>I wanted to love this, but the search continues...</li>
            <li>I really love this conditioner.  </li>
            <li>If you love vanilla you&#x27;ll love this product.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t love the fact that it had leaked all over the inside of the packaging.  </li>
            <li>After blow drying I could not help but notice how healthy and shiny may hair looked...</li>
            <li>her scalp has not been so healthy ever - and she is now a devoted user too.</li>
            <li>I love this conditioner.</li>
            <li>It works best when left on hair for about 5 min or more before rinsing.  </li>
            <li>My hair has never felt better than when I started using this conditioner.  </li>
            <li>It looks so much better</li>
            <li>it made my hair softer, smoother and more moist, I like it a lot, 4 stars for not showing any directions to use or even ingredients on the bottle</li>
            <li>and I love that it is holistic in nature</li>
            <li>Love the product.</li>
            <li>my Amazon purchased ID #1140173554-2268229 :)  22 Clenning Street, Nepean Ontario, K2J 5B2  </li>

            <li>This product could not have come at a better time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Sage shampoo which I love</li>
            <li>so I tried this and love it.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>i love it.</li>
            <li>mostly blow drying.. and its just easier, and nicer for me to wear my curls then to just straighten It</li>
            <li>It feels overall healthier which is great!</li>
            <li>I love Maple Holistics</li>
            <li>Smell was ok.</li>
            <li>and I love applying the Silk 18 as my follow up conditioner.</li>
            <li>so glad I ordered</li>
            <li>I love how silky it makes my hair in the shower.</li>
            <li>Absolutely amazing conditioner, my hair is silky smooth.</li>
            <li>When I use this product, I have to use more conditioning products  to soften my hair before blow drying.</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>Per the included usage tips i made sure to use the conditioner everywhere, not just the ends of my hair.</li>
            <li>I love the result.</li>
            <li>really wanted to love this, since the ingredients are great</li>
            <li>I really love ALL of the Maple Holistics shampoo&#x27;s and conditioners.</li>
            <li>and I like it better than my H&amp;S conditioner.</li>
            <li>I really love the smell.</li>
            <li>I was afarid I would be loosing quality, but this is actually better than anything I&#x27;ve tried before.</li>
            <li>I love this conditioner.</li>
            <li>My stylist tells me that my hair is extremely healthy and that the products I am using in my hair are working well.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many products.  </li>
            <li>It worked even better when I made sure just to apply the conditioner to the ends of my hair and not the scalp.  </li>
            <li>I have paid more for conditioner that didn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li>I will purchase more.</li>
            <li>SUCH A GREAT CONDITIONER!!!</li>
            <li>I totally LOVE the scent</li>
            <li>This conditioner contains most of the ingredients I was planning to treat my scalp with.  </li>
            <li>will have to use it for a bit before i can tell for sure</li>
            <li>I hope to see more of a difference as I keep using this conditioner.</li>
            <li>, it makes me feel better knowing I am not putting a bunch of chemicals on my head</li>
            <li>It breaks my hair and my customer&#x27;s hair even more now.</li>
            <li>Had the wonderful idea to get a perm and it totally fried my hair!  </li>
            <li>I love the way looked after using this conditioner.</li>
            <li>I love vanilla anyways</li>
            <li>Love love this product.</li>

            <li>I LOVE THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li>SURE I DONT RUN OUT</li>
            <li>I love this conditioner.  </li>
            <li>but I was pleased with the results after using this conditioner once</li>
            <li>This conditioner is my favorite conditioner and my husband is hooked too.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I use the argan shampoo and silk 18 conditioner, I love the combination together.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell.</li>
            <li>My hair is the most manageable it has ever been and</li>
            <li>I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am very happy that I&#x27;ve finally found something that helps my hair look and feel healthier</li>
            <li>- my hair feels better after washing with thier Argan Oil Shampoo &amp; conditioning, and it&#x27;s prettier.  </li>
            <li>I must say my hair is definitely in better shape than when I began using it, but I also attribute that to a sunflower/castor oil mask I made at home.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to love you.</li>
            <li>This product seems to help my hair be shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li>Silk 18 is better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve since been trying different ways to bring out my best curl.</li>
            <li>I love that if I am just bumming around I do not have to put any product in my hair.</li>
            <li>I decided to try Silk 18 and love the softness and luscious vanilla scent it gives my hair.  </li>
            <li>If they had it in another scent this product would deserve more than 5 stars.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to use much of Silk 18 to get great results.</li>
            <li>My hair has never felt better.</li>
            <li>And it smells fantastic!</li>
            <li>I will continue to buy Silk18, I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>Now it is much better.  </li>
            <li>Love the smell and texture.</li>
            <li>It has more shine and body, and it feels thicker.  </li>
            <li>I knew there had to be a better solution.</li>
            <li>I love the smell.</li>
            <li>Which is still better than oily.  </li>
            <li>Hair is silky smooth!</li>
            <li>Sulfate free!</li>
            <li>and Love the smell.</li>
            <li>Thank you :)</li>
            <li>But I think it&#x27;s better than most.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use both the Maple Holistics shampoo and their Silk 18 conditioner and have never found anything that leaves my hair in better condition.  </li>
            <li>I was actually able to get a comb through my hair after I got out of the shower which is a miracle.  </li>
            <li>It makes my curly hair SO much more manageable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it all summer and love it.</li>
            <li>My hair feels more silky and hydrated after i started using it</li>
            <li>I am extremely satisfied with my purchase and will be buying this one again.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for the last 2 weeks Very HAPPY with the results and would recommend it to both men &amp; women</li>
            <li>Bed head is better</li>
            <li>I love this conditioner.  </li>
            <li>This has added more moisture to my hair.  </li>
            <li>I wish that more companies would pay attention to their business model!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this product it changed my hair&lt;</li>
            <li>I have had many complements on my hair now.&lt;br /&gt;Comb</li>
            <li>I ordered this conditioner along with their argan oil shampoo and the two of them together are a winning combination.</li>
            <li>but it was much more manageable and healthy looking.</li>
            <li>Trying to be more of organic in the cosmetic department too.</li>
            <li>And the conditioner made it smell like magic.</li>
            <li>I will probably buy more.</li>
            <li>It may be better if it was on a box like those they put body scrubs.</li>
            <li>I love the way this conditioner smells and feels on my hair and beard.</li>
            <li>Love the smell, love the product...</li>
            <li>I love the smell of it.</li>
            <li>Smells great and works really well.</li>
            <li>The smell of this conditioner makes its purchase worthwhile.</li>
            <li>That makes my hunt all the more challenging.</li>
            <li>I love this conditioner.</li>
            <li>I like the conditioner better than the shampoo.</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>With all that said, I will continue to use these products as they are still better than what&#x27;s offered in salons.</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>I tried many conditioners.</li>
            <li>It said hint of Vanilla, but I am not so sure about that.</li>
            <li>All my reviews and star rating on the items are truthful and unbiased.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this conditioner.</li>
            <li>Overall, it is a good buy!!</li>
            <li>I have never used a better conditioner.</li>
            <li>Fantastic!  </li>
            <li>The conditioner itself may be okay.</li>
            <li>If you like everyone to be able to smell you when you walk into room then you&#x27;ll probably love this. .</li>
            <li>Now that I have been using Silk 18 for a while (on my third bottle), I can now say that it is the best conditioner I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone through one bottle of this product, and still love it.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t stop touching it.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE the feeling i get after using the conditioner.</li>
            <li>It had synthetic fragrance, and even more of my hair fell out, my scalp started to peel, and it was inflamed.</li>
            <li>Please keep the prices low, as this is the best conditioner (and shampoo)</li>
            <li>Not only is it affordable, it&#x27;s a great product!</li>
            <li>Love the smell and quality.</li>
            <li>more I use this conditioner,  the more I love it.</li>
            <li>conditioner that would make my frizzy, out-of control hair be somewhat more manageable, and it did...</li>
            <li>Check out the answer in the Q&amp;A section about ingredients and be sure to expand it (I didn&#x27;t before my purchase, which was a mistake).</li>
            <li>Yeah it makes your hair more manageable, because it strips it.</li>
            <li>it was more manageable BUT there are risks it seems.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d love if there were more in the bottle,</li>
            <li>i can&#x27;t wait to see how much better my hair gets with continued use</li>
            <li>I love the smell also.</li>
            <li>i have been using this and the Argan shampoo and love both.</li>
            <li>I love this conditioner.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thrilled that it&#x27;s sulfate free because I know it won&#x27;t compromise my hair coloring.  </li>
            <li>It was bouncy and held the curl better than ever before.  </li>
            <li>Love Love Silk 18.  </li>

            <li>You will love how it makes your hair feel.</li>

            <li>but it&#x27;s safe to say that I love the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love it :)</li>
            <li>the most part I am scared of Keratin treatments, it dries but hair out</li>
            <li>will buy again and again and again :)</li>
            <li>well my hair seemed more brittle and became greasy faster.  </li>
            <li>But, then I moved on to Silk18 that so many reviewers were speaking of.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also glad to know the ingredients are all natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought it because I read all the wonderful reviews, but I didn&#x27;t get the same results.</li>
            <li>My favorite conditioner.</li>
            <li>but, after using this conditioner just once my hair feels a million times better</li>
            <li>He told me he would send me another shampoo which would work better for me.  </li>
            <li>I love the product.</li>

            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for about two weeks now, and am glad I purchased it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just be sure to rinse hair well to get all of the conditioner out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>The conditioner was just okay.</li>
            <li>Maybe this is why so many in this sustainable community have dreadlocks..</li>
            <li>This is probably my favorite conditioner.</li>
            <li>I found this conditioner while I was searching for top rated ones, and I am glad I did.</li>
            <li>Love this conditioner.</li>
            <li>Most products either don&#x27;t work or make my hair feel greasy.  </li>
            <li>I doubt this is an issue for most people, but I had to give my bottle away.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff :)</li>
            <li>What a lovely product.</li>
            <li>I have been doing my research on hair care products that are healthy for me, the earth and my family.</li>
            <li>we all love the way it smells and conditions our hair.</li>
            <li>I got this product mostly for my mom because I wanted us to start trying some organic products.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much more fuller</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not oily at the top anymore.</li>
            <li>I finally have what I want and deserve, a healthy scalp and beautiful hair!</li>
            <li>Will be buying more of their products for sure.</li>
            <li>I wanted to help and went to my favorite source - Amazon.  </li>
            <li>He picked it up only a week or so ago, and texted this morning &amp;#34;That dandruff conditioner is awesome!</li>
            <li>It has been around a week of using the conditioner and my hair has noticeably became so much more healthy.</li>
            <li>The ingredients are safe and well thought out.  </li>

            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m impressed w/</li>
            <li>This is simply the best conditioner I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve noticed that my hear maintains better elasticity and looks shinier.</li>
            <li>Oh well it still beats pantene pro-v any day:)</li>
            <li>I have used both conditioners with the Argan shampoo by Maple Holistics, and have reordered all three products again so I can decide what seems to work better after using them a bit longer.</li>
            <li>It felt like magic in my hair.</li>
            <li>and I have to use more than suggested during a conditioning session.</li>
            <li>I am in love .</li>
            <li>FABULOUS!</li>
            <li>I LOVE the smell too:)</li>

            <li>BEST OF all--it&#x27;s all NATURAL, paraben free.</li>
            <li>I tried this on a whim after reading so many reviews.</li>
            <li>it really reduced frizz, still have great body, got a comb thru it like silk</li>
            <li>im sure</li>
            <li>I just ordered two bottles and also ordered  the argan oil shampoo, not even going to bother with a sample that&#x27;s how confidant I am that I will love it.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product and will continue to use it for many years to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really love this conditioner.</li>
            <li>Every time I use this I think it smells like root beer and to me, that is ok</li>
            <li>I tried silk conditioner and fell in love.</li>
            <li>In desperation I&#x27;ve switched to no sulfate/silicone free shampoos and conditioners and have even resorted to making my own.</li>
            <li>Best of all is how my hair feels - soft, smooth and hydrated.  </li>
            <li>My friend, knowing how much I love all-natural conditioners, bought this for my birthday.</li>
            <li>After reading reviews about people who have used this product as a deep conditioner, I decided to try leaving it in my hair longer, and the results were great!</li>
            <li>I really love this conditioner.</li>
            <li>I love knowing it&#x27;s organic and better for my hair.</li>
            <li>and i have to say I love it</li>
            <li>the smell is also refreshing with vanilla undertone.</li>
            <li>Great product and the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li>I bought the shampoo and despite reading that if you have oily hair you should not condition I am glad that I decided to get the conditioner anyway.  </li>
            <li>It gives my hair a light silky feel after washing it and a nice woody vanilla smell that smells yummy and not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoyed the smell and how it took out all the tangles out of my hair.</li>
            <li>I will be trying the shampoo next because I am happy with this product!</li>
            <li>I love this conditioner.</li>
            <li>and I love the vanilla scent.</li>

            <li>Fantastic conditioner!  </li>
            <li>I am really pleased and will order again.</li>
            <li>This conditioner seems to have the perfect combination of enough moisturizing without adding weight.  </li>
            <li>Really enjoyed this product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not kidding, I keep touching it because I can&#x27;t believe it myself.</li>

            <li>Leaves my hair incredible silky smooth and smells wonderful (though subtle) - like creamy shea butter.</li>

            <li>The first  is for its good smelling.</li>

            <li>This conditioner feels good at first, but after 8-12 hours, my hair starts to look and feel greasy.</li>
            <li>I want though, because my hair looks pretty good coming out of the salon -</li>

            <li>I liked that it didn&#x27;t make my hands fill super oily</li>
            <li>I need a strong conditioner as it gets tangled and static, but I wanted something all-natural and cruelty-free.  </li>
            <li>If my hair was at a zero in how dry it is out of 10 being the best hair; I would say this product brought my hair to a 7.  </li>
            <li>I also love the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell.</li>
            <li>: it came so quick i was honestly blown away.</li>
            <li>After use, my hair is noticeably softer and styles more easily.</li>
            <li>This Silk 18 is perfect for my dry and curly hair.  </li>
            <li>I know that Silk 18 is a natural product with many great ingredients for hair treatment.</li>
            <li>love it:) I use it with argan oil sulfate free shampoo.</li>
            <li>First thing is first, this smells incredible.</li>
            <li>My hair has so much more volume and bounce to it and seems to catch the light better, giving my hair a depth of color and texture that it didn&#x27;t have before with storebought conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I loved the &#x27;silk&#x27; name, thought it would make my hair silky soft and fell for the labels nicely placed alongside the picture.</li>
            <li>The only good thing I have to say about it  is that it smelled good.</li>
            <li>I received it as a gift ,and loved it ,I have been having problems with my hair and scalp and it really helps ,love the way my hair fills and smell.</li>

            <li>My hair felt so clean and my curls were so bouncy!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, I love what this product has done for my toddlers curly, fine hair.</li>
            <li>The best treatment for my dry hair!  </li>
            <li>I have used many  other name products and like this product the best.</li>
            <li>Would love to try other items in the line as well to see if they are just as great as this one!</li>
            <li>When I applied the shampoo is was light weight but did the job of making my scalp feel clean and hydrated, a refreshing feeling, and very easy to rinse out.</li>
            <li>Good stuff if you like the smell of vanilla (which I certainly do).</li>
            <li>It certainly smells good.</li>
            <li>and I like shampoos and conditioners that smell fresh and clean and bright.</li>

            <li>So far, I have been happy with this conditioner and plan to buy it again.</li>
            <li>I have a tendency to test the conditioner because it is more important to me than what shampoo I use.</li>

            <li>After reading about this product and all the greatness it has to offer (natural ingredients that i can pronounce, no animal testing, and all the great reviews, etc.)</li>
            <li>This is fantastic for hair to absorb the most.</li>

            <li>I also bought the sulfate free shampoo which I love.</li>
            <li>Great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>ingredients are natural and it lends to the outdoorsy smell with vanilla undertones that smells great all day.</li>
            <li>This conditioner smells amazing, Im pretty sure I&#x27;ve found my shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li>The smell was great, but hardly natural.</li>
            <li>the top 3 selling points of this conditioner are that it&#x27;s sulfate free, not tested on animals</li>
            <li>It makes my hair soft and shiny, and adds slip for great combability.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair smooth and I love the smell.</li>

            <li>We are a very holistic family and we have never found a holistic hair conditioner that is as good as this one.</li>
            <li>I loved Maple Holistics product so much, i still have some frizz on the ends</li>
            <li>Thanks to all and good</li>
            <li>It has been a long process and I have come across some good and some not so good products.  </li>
            <li>The product as a whole was definitely a good purchase.</li>
            <li>Smells wonderful, makes your hair look and feel healthy without weighing it down.</li>
            <li>I have been meaning to write this review for a while because I rarely find a product for my fine hair that I truly LOVE!  </li>
            <li>Whatever they use is something special!  </li>
            <li>In the meantime I guess I&#x27;ll use it on special occasions!</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair tangle free, smooth, soft and it smells really good!</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a miracle in it&#x27;s own right.</li>
            <li>it leaves my hair so soft and smooth!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of treatments for my hair, and probably most of the brands out there, by far this is the best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever tried, it leaves my hair incredibly soft and looking healthy.</li>
            <li>This is a very nice conditioner that leaves my hair feeling soft but manageable.  </li>
            <li>My hair feels soft and looks very nice.</li>
            <li>am nearing 60 with bra strap length, super fine hair which tangles very easily.</li>
            <li>The shampoo lathers up very nicely and has a nice scent to it, but after rinsing my hair it felt dry and brittle.  </li>
            <li>This conditioner not only managed to do that, but it also smells so good!</li>
            <li>I wash my hair because I feel it necessary, but it still looks just as good on day 3 as it does on day 1!</li>
            <li>It makes my hair softer than if I didn&#x27;t use it, but it&#x27;s not the best conditioner out there, despite other rave reviews.</li>
            <li>This conditioner has those stats, and a wonderful creamy texture that seemed to absorb into the hair quicker than other products i have tried.  </li>
            <li>Other than that it was wonderful.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s full luster!</li>
            <li>I think it does a great job of pretty much eliminating static electricity in my hair.</li>
            <li>After doing some research on other recommended products, I decided to try this one since it was on sale and had awesome reviews.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this on all hair types and I am excited to try more of their products.</li>
            <li>Not a bad product, great shipping, nice vanilla scent, but kind of watery and certainly not super moisturizing or a detangler.</li>
            <li>It is light weight, smells great and makes my hair feel soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair perfect so soft, and real moisture.  </li>
            <li>So far very happy with my purchase - the product was packaged very well and no leakage in transport.  </li>
            <li>5 stars, easy.</li>
            <li>Overall, I feel that this is an excellent product worth trying.</li>
            <li>My hair breaks and splits easy.  </li>
            <li>Affordable, effective, and organic...can&#x27;t really get much better than that.&lt;br /&gt;Leave</li>
            <li>and it would break easily.  </li>
            <li>Silk 18 distributed evenly and rinsed out easily.</li>
            <li>in three days, my scalp was clean and flake free!  </li>
            <li>The shampoo lathered well and rinsed away easily</li>
            <li>so it dries out easily.  </li>
            <li>I can comb my hair easily when I get out of the shower.</li>
            <li>but I like to be more squeaky clean when I rinse off so 4/5 stars from me.</li>
            <li>Combs out easily and feels hydrated.</li>
            <li>Smells great, but more importantly, definitely leaves my hair feeling softer/smoother and looking a bit &#x27;brighter&#x27;.</li>
            <li>Her hair brushes out so easily after bath time.</li>
            <li>So far I am loving this conditioner and hope it will continue to give me amazing results.</li>
            <li>The conditioner worked well and was easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair, shiny and bouncy and easy to style.</li>
            <li>The package was easy to open.&lt;br /&gt;PS-</li>
            <li>Smells great, doesn&#x27;t leave residue, controls frizz quite a bit and leaves hair soft and tangle free.</li>
            <li>When you get the perfect amount for you, it really makes your hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It leaves my hair soft, manageable, and smelling great!&lt;br /&gt;Customer service at Maple Holistics is awesome - very helpful.</li>
            <li>This conditioner reduces the volume of my hair and make it easy to handle my hair even when it&#x27;s raining.</li>
            <li>The design and the hardness of the plastic of the bottle prevents customers from easily squeezing the conditioner out.  </li>
            <li>Easily de-tangles my always tangling hair</li>
            <li>The smell is a bit strong but dissipates after about 6 hours.  </li>
            <li>Smell was way too strong for me</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s spring; I&#x27;m allergic, period), the vanilla fragrance is way too strong.  </li>
            <li>The scent is strong in the shower-</li>
            <li>so it was too strong for me.</li>
            <li>The shampoo has a strong medicinal smell, and I&#x27;m telling you this because this Silk 18 conditioner has a strong, masking vanilla scent.</li>
            <li>consistency.&lt;br /&gt;- Strong vanilla scent.</li>
            <li>Plus it&#x27;s a safe and natural product I feel good about using.</li>
            <li>I love how smooth my hair feels and so clean, and most importantly my hair no longer tangles into knots the day after I shampoo.</li>
            <li>So far so good :)</li>
            <li>I love that there are no harsh chemicals and that it is truly all ingredients that are good.</li>
            <li>The scent is not too strong which I also like.  </li>
            <li>natural ingredients, smells good, and leaves my hair siky smooth!</li>
            <li>The scent is a strong vanilla type smell.</li>
            <li>It was too strong for me.</li>
            <li>I agree with some reviewers that the fragrance is a bit strong while standing in the shower, but I don&#x27;t notice it anymore after rinsing and drying.  </li>
            <li>I can understand why some reviewers say the scent is strong</li>
            <li>smell is not too strong.</li>
            <li>Not too strong for me.</li>
            <li>I disagree with others that say it smells too strong.</li>
            <li>It is far superior to chemically based salon brands - most of which contain damaging silicone ingredients.</li>
            <li>Scent is way to strong for my taste.</li>
            <li>Love this product .It makes my hair very silky ..and really nice smell.</li>
            <li>It smelled of vanilla, but was not too strong for my liking.</li>
            <li>Just okay, nothing special.</li>
            <li>This conditioner first and foremost smells amazing.</li>
            <li>My hair is so soft after using and the smell is amazing!</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with this product and am looking forward to seeing how much it will continue to help my hair with repeated use.</li>
            <li>It is NATURAL, NO ANIMAL TESTING, and it  WORKS AMAZINGLY!</li>
            <li>Out of all of the safe and natural conditioners I have tried, it is the best I have found so far.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best and most natural creme rinse for any hair type.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for shampoo/conditioner that I can feel good about as my family moves towards a more natural and chemical free lifestyle.  </li>
            <li>First off, it smells amazing.</li>
            <li>I Love this Product so much that I only use it when I want my hair to look its best!</li>
            <li>My hair is more shiny and full than ever.  </li>
            <li>straightening- the curls underneath formed thick, perfect ringlets and looked even better than my top layer...</li>
            <li>Love the softness, no tangles, no buildup so my hair stays full.</li>
            <li>It is much better than those store bought brands as they are full of toxins.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>even the smell of is pretty nice.</li>
            <li>At first, I bought a cheaper conditioner, and though that helped, I wasn&#x27;t thrilled about some of the ingredients (and lack of others).</li>
            <li>this conditioner leaves my hair soft and shiny and the smell is so nice!</li>
            <li>Liked it for about the first week...</li>
            <li>I have tried many natural conditioners and this is by far the best yet!</li>
            <li>but they&#x27;ve managed to make it actually pretty nice.  </li>
            <li>It is much better than those store bought brands as they are full of chemicals.</li>
            <li>Would love to try it in combination with a matching shampoo or conditioning cleanser to get the full effect.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-- Full of potent ingredients for hair health like Silk Amino Acids, Argan, Jojoba, and Keratin&lt;br /&gt;--</li>
            <li>I love that it does not weigh your hair down and it leaves a very pleasant light vanilla scent.</li>
            <li>This is hands down the best conditioner i have ever used.</li>
            <li>It does wonders but doesn&#x27;t weigh down hair, a great product!</li>

            <li>Hands down the BEST non-greasy, no residue, detangling conditioner ever!!!!  </li>
            <li>My hair is soft and shiny and the smell is pleasant, even though vanilla is not an awesome scent choice, it is not worth lowering the rating.  </li>
            <li>The smell is great- not too much vanilla, but very warm and full-bodied.</li>
            <li>I was excited about a more natural, made in America product that sounded so good for my hair.</li>
            <li>With this conditioner, my hair feels smooth and it is easy to style.</li>
            <li>I have extremely fine hair</li>

            <li>My hair is a mix of fine</li>
            <li>If you have fine hair, like my daughter does, you will want to use just a touch and not overdo it.</li>
            <li>(if you have fine hair, you understand why this matters, can&#x27;t tug through like heartier tresses.)</li>
            <li>Just the thought that it has helped keep it conditioned and healthy for the past 2 months is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>the only one that really leaves my hair shiny - Jason&#x27;s Biotin Shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After washing it, I have been doing a &amp;#34;conditioner-experiment&amp;#34;, and while most of the results were good, the results I got using the Silk 18 Natural Conditioner by Maple Holistics, were great!</li>
            <li>I have fine straighter hair</li>
            <li>The shampoo is fine, nothing to write home about, but the conditioner is fabulous.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>I have fine, oily hair; I bought the Maple Holistics Degrease shampoo and this conditioner.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo bottle was fine, though.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine, but I have quite a lot of it, and it is medium-to-long in length.</li>
            <li>I have baby fine hair and lots of it.</li>
            <li>~ most of the products on the shelves of stores are cheap and chopped full of lies.</li>

            <li>I love this sooooo much! :)</li>

            <li>Pleasant smell, not heavy, smoothes hair, calms frizzies and fuzzy ends.</li>

            <li>She suggested a sulfate free product.</li>
            <li>and why they sent me a free product of my choosing.</li>
            <li>I received a free bottle of Argon oil conditioner, which I just love.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have always bought cheap shampoos from the pharmacy</li>
            <li>and it took time to recover my smooth hair.</li>
            <li>chemical filled conditioner.</li>
            <li>I have been using this conditioner for a few weeks, and it’s literally the best conditioner I’ve ever used (and believe me…</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so tangle free.</li>
            <li>Company seems genuinely invested in their product.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is just fantastic...</li>
            <li>It makes my hair smooth and light and shiny.</li>
            <li>It would be great if this came in a bigger bottle - 1 bottle</li>
            <li>I am happy with the ingredients, which I can pronounce and with the way it left my hair feeling and smelling!</li>
            <li>I like that they are sulfate free.  </li>
            <li>swingy and these products fit the bill.  </li>
            <li>The product can be applied to the hair so smoothly.</li>
            <li>My fingers don&#x27;t run through my hair as smoothly as they did.</li>
            <li>Fantastic conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I noticed the smell, it&#x27;s fantastic.</li>

            <li>This stuff is fantastic.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a light vanilla-ish smell.  </li>
            <li>It was like I&#x27;d covered myself in a cheap body spray from the mall.  </li>
            <li>it still turns out sleek &amp; smooth.  </li>
            <li>If you have a sensitivity to fragrance or just find the smell of many products aggressively perfumey then this one is certainly worth a try.</li>
            <li>This conditioner is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I need a light conditioner</li>
            <li>It makes my hair silky and smooth without making it oily</li>

            <li>It leaves hair shiny, smooth and manageable</li>

            <li>This conditioner if fantastic.  </li>
            <li>He sent me the Sage Shampoo FREE OF COST -</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s great to have something that can repair such damage i&#x27;ve done.</li>
            <li>My hair was silky smooth.</li>
            <li>I also like that it is a sulfate free product.  </li>
            <li>Free Shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li>I tried the argan sulfate free shampoo because it was the number one shampoo recommended on amazon.</li>
            <li>the Silk conditioner does a fantastic job of detangling.</li>
            <li>If you are used to creamy conditioners that detangle your hair be prepared to adjust to a sulfate - free experience.</li>
            <li>It does the job, leaving my hair silky smooth</li>
            <li>but perhaps there should be an economy size available too.</li>
            <li>this stuff is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Iove that it is sulfate free.</li>
            <li>I sprayed it on my hair and left it as a leave in conditioner and works great.</li>
            <li>It is light and organic.</li>
            <li>So happy that I finally found something</li>
            <li>However, over the summer, I switched to a sulfate free shampoo and began putting coconut oil in my hair.</li>
            <li>It smells like it says a light vanilla scent it is yummyyyy.</li>
            <li>I used this product for a deep conditioner and it works great on my hair.</li>
            <li>It smells fantastic and makes my hair silky smooth.</li>
            <li>Someone mentioned in a review that you can get a free sample to try from the company, so that&#x27;s what I did.  </li>
            <li>won&#x27;t be asking for the free product because I don&#x27;t need whatever they want to give me.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product that I will continue to use on a regular basis.</li>
            <li>I am so happy with this shampoo I will definitely continue using it, my hair is softer and shinier that it ever has been.</li>

            <li>This is such a great product...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing, really.  </li>
            <li>I think this would make for a great deep conditioner.</li>
            <li>My hair is now silky smooth.</li>
            <li>Huge plus that it&#x27;s a sulfate free</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair silky smooth.</li>
            <li>Maple Holistics seems like such a great company, and they will help you with anything and answer questions that you might have.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair smooth.</li>
            <li>received this product as a free sample from Maple Holistics, but I will be buying again and again.</li>

            <li>My hair feels lightweight and is frizz free, while my curls stay light and bouncy.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, I found my brand and my products:</li>
            <li>I am so thankful to have such a great product.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair fairly smooth and silky.  </li>
            <li>I also ride along on our motorcycles and drive the convertible and let my hair blow freely in the wind.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t hesitate get your free sample.</li>
            <li>but this made it silk and smooth.</li>
            <li>The shampoo and conditioner I got from you guys healed my scalp in about 2 or 3 washes and I like that the smell of each is a light citrus/vanilla ish sent.</li>
            <li>I tried tea tree shampoo and that makes my scalp tingle and feel clean but its scent is too strong.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s fantastic.  </li>
            <li>That was 15 hours of light vanilla scented hair.</li>
            <li>and my hair is silky smooth.  </li>
            <li>My hair was so silky smooth</li>
            <li>Sulfate free</li>
            <li>While conditioning you smell a nice really mellow vanilla fragrance, and after rinse-out, no fragrance lingers&lt;br /&gt;--</li>
            <li>Fantastic...</li>
            <li>I was searching for a reall good conditioner that didn&#x27;t take the volume away and at the same time gave my hair the moisture it needs to feel healthy and bouncy and shiny.</li>
            <li>Thank you amazon-much appreciated for such a wonderful product.</li>
            <li>So far, so good after using it for a day.</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>Needed a good, natural conditioner for my color-treated hair.</li>
            <li>This natural conditioner was recommended by my good friend working in a health department.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;ve finally found a conditioner which is good for my hair.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>I have used better at a better price (try Aussie&#x27;s 3 Minute Miracle, $2.99, for that price it really is a miracle).</li>
            <li>Both young ladies were delighted with the results, so I ordered a bottle for myself.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good natural product.</li>
            <li>It smells good and keeps your hair feeling soft and lightweight</li>
            <li>It made her hair so soft and smell so good after one use.  </li>
            <li>I tried on my daughters natural hair and it worked good (no medicine like smell there).</li>
            <li>This is one of a good conditioner I have used so far.</li>
            <li>I will update this if anything changes but so far so good.</li>
            <li>I love this, and have found a cruelty-free, American-made hair product that I can&#x27;t say enough good things about.</li>
            <li>It smells so good &amp; leaves my hair so soft &amp; shiny.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this several times, just to be sure to give it a fair chance.</li>
            <li>Thanks Maple Holistic for such a wonderful product!</li>
            <li>In fact, I&#x27;ve found that since I started using this conditioner, my curls keep their shape for much longer, so now I&#x27;m able to avoid drying-out my scalp (and my curls) with too many washes in a week.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product for anyone looking for a good, all natural, conditioner.</li>
            <li>Wanted something natural for my hair and tried this, I loved it.</li>
            <li>It smells so good, like vanilla, and it leaves my hair ridiculously soft.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Our hair is soft and feels so good after using, just what i was looking for.</li>
            <li>Smells good made my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>My experience includes many different shampoos and conditioners: some good, some not so.</li>
            <li>I feel good that it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li>I also am able to straighten my hair and style it way easier than normal and it looks healthier!!!</li>
            <li>I would really advise anyone to look through reviews by star ratings, don&#x27;t just go through the first couple of pages and see all 5 star ratings and think its a great product, most of these reviews were probably done positively to get the free product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine if you use a shampoo that&#x27;s rich.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a light warm vanilla smell that fades away pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>I’m a huge fan!&lt;br /&gt;I’m also very satisfied with the retailer Maple Holistics, they were extremely professional and speedy!  </li>
            <li>I tried a lot of different conditioners but this one leaft my hair smelling great and feeling fresh!</li>
            <li>The vanilla scent is alright too, sweet and not too strong.</li>
            <li>I also noticed that it grows much faster than ever before!!!</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m really really glad I found this product!!</li>
            <li>Will definitely be buying more of this product!!</li>
            <li>and it is now feeling silky again and has a very nice shine that recently someone commented about.  </li>
            <li>My hair feels super clean afterwards and even looks clean!</li>
            <li>At first I feel my hair became very smooth and silky after using it, then after about two weeks I found that my hair loss has been under coontrol, I used it with Argan Oil Shampoo, it seems to work well together.</li>
            <li>The scent was light and clean.</li>
            <li>I purchased along with the top selling natural shampoo with the best ratings on amazon and my hair is just as dry as before using the product.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair smooth and I am very sure my hair loves all the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>All natural, smells amazing, and leaves my hair super shiny, and healthy after just one use.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used a cruelty free product this good for my hair since ever because apparently, they haven&#x27;t been in production until now.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am very pleased with this conditioner :)</li>
            <li>I love how natural the ingredients are and how strong and healthy my hair feels now.</li>
            <li>I purchased the argan oil shampoo and silk 18 conditioner about a  month and a half ago and wanted to make sure to use it for a while before reviewing to make sure I had a good idea.  </li>
            <li>conditioner works great for me doesn&#x27;t irritate skin and makes my hair so soft i noticed difference after first use .smells</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t stand the super strong vanilla smell.  </li>
            <li>As for myself, without knowing that I started using a new conditioner, commented on how good my hair looked after just the first use!</li>
            <li>Not only does it have a light refreshing vanilla smell but even better is the results!</li>
            <li>Maple Holistics is one of my new favorite companies!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is my new favorite!</li>
            <li>This conditioner is really nice- or smells good, leaves my hair soft and shiny - I most definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I have tried MANY different natural &amp; organic conditioners that were ok, but nothing great-</li>
            <li>But overall I&#x27;m pretty much happy with this product because my hair is no longer full of static</li>
            <li>I am really loving this conditioner so far!!</li>
            <li>If you have dry or damaged hair or you have extensions and need a good conditioner, try this you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li>Everyone&#x27;s hair was soft, smelled nice, and easily combed.</li>
            <li>Made my hair super soft and it smells really good.  </li>
            <li>the ingredient list is great, but i didn&#x27;t FEEL that my hair was ANY better at all, compared to typical conditioner.</li>
            <li>It truly made my hair very soft with great shine and very manageable.</li>
            <li>The only way to explain this conditioner is AMAZING!</li>
            <li>I style my hair with a hot air brush and it looks better then</li>
            <li>Even after one conditioner use I noticed a significant difference.</li>
            <li>Just that first use alone has given a lot of healthy characteristics to my longer hairstyle.</li>
            <li>I originally bought this conditioner, along with the argon oil shampoo for one of my guest bathrooms.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li>I really enjoy the conditioner, however, for me I feel like I need a shampoo to pair it with in order to gain the full benefits of the product.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;d have to say that I&#x27;m very satisfied with Maple Holistics Silk 18.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Believe me when i say that from the first use itself my hair started to feel and look way way better.</li>
            <li>It smells Vanilla for the first 15-20 minutes, nothing over the top.</li>
            <li>First of all, I LOVE the smell of this product.  </li>
            <li>I love it and will go back for more!</li>
            <li>I started using this on my daughter hair, along with a wet brush, and it brushes through beautifully.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a funny problem to have :))</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li>So fresh!</li>
            <li>THE FIRST PRODUCT OUT OF MANY</li>
            <li>The minute I received the silk18 conditioner by Maple Holistics I immediately ran to wash my hair because I was so excited to try it out.</li>
            <li>Some products I tried work at first, then after a while, the magic disappears.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m originally from Australia).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I also like the fresh fragrance!  </li>
            <li>I would be willing to pay more for a &amp;#34;value&amp;#34; size.</li>
            <li>Most on the first use.</li>
            <li>I also love the price, it makes it very affordable!</li>
            <li>I am not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>I was SO excited to find a a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I have tried many conditioners and this is the first conditioner that seems to keep my hair under control.</li>
            <li>I have since purchased 3 more bottles of Silk after I first used this one.</li>
            <li>Giving 4 out of 5 because of my unique hair type.</li>
            <li>so I am beyond excited to keep using it</li>
            <li>Works great on my long hair.</li>
            <li>My hair feels softer, silkier, and very healthy with a natural shine.  </li>
            <li>After two uses, I can say that my hair feels significantly softer.</li>
            <li>And almost as importantly, this is a reasonably priced product available on Prime :)</li>
            <li>I am excited about this conditioner--it seems to suit my hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair was noticeably softer after the first time I used it, and it is getting better with each use.  </li>
            <li>the tangles are gone, it is manageable, no more than just a couple strands fell out in the shower, it feels moisturized, and best of all, it flows!  </li>
            <li>Love it and love the fact that it&#x27;s all natural ingredients!</li>
            <li>When it came I was excited and scared to try it.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product, by far my favorite of the MANY I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m interested in a conditoner that is safe for me and the environment.  </li>
            <li>It is well worth the price!</li>
            <li>I have really enjoyed my first purchase of Silk 18 conditioner, in conjunction  with the Maple Holistics Argan Oil Shampoo.</li>
            <li>My hair started shedding like it had when I used to use store-bought conditioners (not clumps or anything, but fairly significant).</li>
            <li>she was so excited she  immediately gave me the  conditioner, Silk 18 for me to try.  </li>
            <li>I was searching for a good, daily conditioner for my fine hair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably a good product for certain hair types but didn&#x27;t do much for my curly course hair.</li>
            <li>Even while I was still in the shower I noticed that my hair felt great and was super soft after the first use.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to those who want natural and beautiful hair without harmful ingredients.</li>
            <li>i was very excited to use it for the first time.</li>
            <li>I love the rich vanilla scent of this conditioner, and my dry, frizzy hair is much more soft, manageable and looks great and moisturized.</li>
            <li>Great conditioner to help with dry flakes.</li>
            <li>The product is super silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>It was amazing, it likes Jesus came to bless my hair, it was better to style and definitely healthier.</li>
            <li>Great conditioner for my thin,frizzy and dry damaged hair.  </li>
            <li>my hair is too dry, its works great for me..</li>
            <li>This product left my hair soft and smelling great!</li>
            <li>No dandruff, scalp feels clean and not itchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con</li>
            <li>More importantly, my soft, shiny and smooth locks have lingered too!</li>
            <li>I have used a lot of different types of conditioner and this is honestly among the top.</li>
            <li>clean</li>
            <li>but with this conditioner after I rinsed once my hands felt clean.  </li>
            <li>So far I am impressed with Silkyness of hair and overall results.</li>
            <li>After shampooing, I use the Silk 18 Conditioner; and my hair feels so clean afterward.  </li>
            <li>Never have I ever used something so clean and dominant before in my life.</li>
            <li>I love that the shampoo makes my hair soft and healthy feeling</li>
            <li>and it feels so clean.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t fruity, but more of a coconut scent nice enough for any man.</li>
            <li>You couldn&#x27;t even run your fingers through it happily when it was DRY.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff my hairs so soft and has  reduced the look of damage in my hair :)</li>
            <li>Feels super smooth.</li>
            <li>It is rare for me to find something that i am satisfied with and this is one of those rare times.</li>
            <li>Just started using this product recently with a DHT blocking shampoo, and I&#x27;m very impressed so far.</li>
            <li>It rinses cleanly and I don&#x27;t feel any residue.  </li>
            <li>I love that this product has so many natural oils and ingredients.  </li>
            <li>It would be good if bigger size is available.</li>
            <li>Got a chance to use this recently and for those with natural hair its great for the winter!</li>
            <li>I wanted to try a product that was more natural and better for my hair.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a lot like Lorde&#x27;s (the singer) on day one, then day two and three, after a quick combing, gives it smooth, rolling waves.</li>
            <li>This has been working great so far, and i would really like to try out a shampoo to go with our conditioner.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love it so far, bought 4 more bottles.</li>
            <li>Even though I eat clean, use organic hair products</li>
            <li>Because the shampoo seems to strip the hair clean, I recommend using the conditioner also.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many conditioners and this one is near the top.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling silky, yet it still feels clean.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s rebounding, and when I use this combination it leaves my hair clean, but not stripped, shiny,</li>
            <li>;  (also at Amazon) with Biotin, Coconut Oil, and Procapil to do an amazing job of getting the hair healthy enough to eliminate hair breakage and hair fall-out in about a month.</li>
            <li>It smells good, leaves hair soft, silky, and fresh.  </li>
            <li>It smells good, leaves hair soft, silky, and fresh.</li>
            <li>This made my hair very soft and smells nice.</li>
            <li>I bought this after reading many positive reviews but it does not perform that well.</li>
            <li>I was thinking about how many positive reviews this product received.  </li>
            <li>I have so many positive things to say about this conditioner I don&#x27;t know where to start.</li>
            <li>My hair smells amazing and the components are all natural!</li>
            <li>Wow!  Amazing Shampoo and Conditioner.  </li>
            <li>this is beyond the best product I have used other than my other shampoos and conditioners and none of them are good</li>
            <li>I love that this product was !00% natural.</li>
            <li>Soft healthy silky hair!  </li>
            <li>THIS conditioner by Maple Holistics is by far my favorite!</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite Conditioner!  </li>
            <li>I have two daughters, one with super fine hair and one with super curly hair.  </li>
            <li>Your fingers slide right through easily</li>
            <li>This conditioner smell wonderful and left my 4b/4c hair super soft.</li>
            <li>It left my hair super soft and the shine is incredible!</li>
            <li>I keep touching it and other people have commented on how good it looks.  </li>
            <li>I originally bought the Argan Shampoo without the conditioner and found it to be very drying and static inducing.  </li>
            <li>I had tried so many brands but all of them regardless of how pure the ingredients were still made my hair fall out when it came time to condition it.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t anything special for me.</li>
            <li>Nothing special..</li>
            <li>I used the Silk 18 conditioner after shampooing with argan special formula shampoo for two mornings in a row now.  </li>
            <li>Ordered another 2 bottles right away!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for the right conditioner that doesn&#x27;t irritate my eczema and this is the one!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not an overbearing smell, it&#x27;s just right!</li>
            <li>Very effective with extremely dry, curly hair.</li>
            <li>It smells aaaa-mazing and is also a great conditioner for very dry, curly hair.</li>
            <li>It has to leave my hair smooth feeling with a decent detangling and even better if it can help keep frizz at bay</li>
            <li>The vanilla smell is very pleasant, and it&#x27;s not very thick like most other conditioners, but not less effective.</li>
            <li>my fine hair still trying to get the right amount.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s natural vanilla scent is amazing &amp; not over powering to my nose, plus, it helps to cover the (offputting) scent of my shampoo.</li>
            <li>gives a balance to my hair, keeps soft and hydrate for days, and with a amazing smell.</li>
            <li>Product smells pretty good and leaves hair soft.</li>
            <li>I have now been using it for a few weeks and, while the difference isn&#x27;t quite as drastic as the first time I used it, it&#x27;s still the best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>This product is amazing and will continue using it as long as it&#x27;s available!</li>
            <li>This conditioner smells amazing and leaves hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair so soft and it smells amazing.</li>
            <li>And bonus points for it smelling like vanilla :)  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I love it and would absolutely recommend it for everyone</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been through a number of conditioners and I have only now found one that I feel good with.</li>
            <li>I have tried many many top line hair products and spent a fortune on them.  </li>
            <li>I have thick curly/wavy hair and this conditioner is one of the best that I have used.  </li>
            <li>I noticed the shampoo and conditioner leaves no residue as my hair looks good even the next morning,.</li>
            <li>Silk 18 leaves my curly wavy hair looking much thicker on top and shiny all over.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice soft and flowy.</li>
            <li>I thought that my hair would always be damaged because I did too much hair coloring, but thankfully I found this conditioner to restore it to better quality.  </li>
            <li>love this product very conditioning</li>
            <li>my hair felt so much softer and wasn&#x27;t as brittle as it was before :)</li>
            <li>This made my hair feel silky with a nice slip and soft.</li>
            <li>Using this for 3 weeks, my hair looks healthy and soft, so I&#x27;m never afraid of brushing my hair any more.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure how much to use though-</li>
            <li>Yes for Carrots actually leaves my hair softer than this which is surprising.  </li>
            <li>Really helps keep over processed (heat, color sprays) smooth and manageable!</li>
            <li>Some of the ingredients are synthetic, but there are some natural and even organically-based ingredients, as well, which is a nice change.  </li>
            <li>My hair is now so much softer and more manageable.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sickeningly sweet.</li>
            <li>After shampooing, be sure you don&#x27;t wash out too much conditioner.</li>
            <li>I decided that I did not want any chemicals in my personal beauty regime and set out to find a good conditioner.</li>
            <li>That would be a dream come true.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good stuff about these products.  </li>
            <li>Company seems cool, too.</li>
            <li>Juat love the Silk 18th Conditioner it has helped my hair so much.</li>
            <li>my hair feels so much softer and i have noticed that i do not have as many split ends as before...</li>
            <li>yes its true</li>
            <li>Most of the times after washing my hair it tends to frizz fast.</li>
            <li>Additionally, it smells amazingly good that I want to  smell my hair day long :) as it is natural, I can safely use it and with ingredients</li>
            <li>My hair is full of body with no hampering residue.</li>
            <li>I recently had my hair highlighted for the first time and wanted to purchase a good moisturizing conditioner to keep my hair from becoming frizzy and damaged.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also good to use as a deep conditioner.</li>
            <li>It is also true that I may get a product for writing this review,  but, I can still review it any way I like.  </li>
            <li>The curls are more defined and my hair is so much softer.</li>
            <li>After towel drying my hair the true test came...</li>
            <li>and I found this conditioners had such a good reviews, so I got it.</li>
            <li>I do need a good shampoo as I only have the conditioner</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to use much, but be sure to leave it on 3-5 minutes.</li>
            <li>I love the lather of the argan shampoo and the fact it doesn&#x27;t have much scent.  </li>
            <li>A friend actually commented that my hair looked really good.</li>
            <li>I would definitely  purchase this again and it is affordable considering all the good ingredients in it.</li>
            <li>It helps to make my hair much softer and more manageable.</li>
            <li>I wanted to like this conditioner more, but it really didn&#x27;t follow through with its promises.</li>
            <li>That seems like a more reasonable value to me.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t know why people love this stuff</li>
            <li>Company made good on money back warranty.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this conditioner.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t stop using it it makes your hair soft and it smells really nice</li>
            <li>The kind you smell in a all natural shop.</li>
            <li>Love how truly &amp;#34;silky&amp;#34; this conditioner leaves my hair...without having to use much at all.  </li>
            <li>On one hand, it&#x27;s nice to know that I&#x27;m using a natural product on my hair.  </li>
            <li>i love it so much.</li>
            <li>I purchased this in 2014 of September and wanted to wait until today to see the full effects of the switch before I wrote my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>About 2 minutes on while in the shower and rinse out with cool water.</li>
            <li>It made my hair bouncy and full of life.</li>
            <li>My hair always feels nice and soft after my showers.</li>
            <li>made it feel nice a soft.</li>
            <li>Already, my hair has more body, shine and texture to it - and is looking like real hair - not frizzy-foam.  </li>
            <li>:) Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>This morning, I woke up with straight, healthy-feeling and lightly scented hair!  </li>
            <li>A true conditioner.</li>
            <li>This conditioner really helped my hair, it is much better looking</li>
            <li>Love the product but feel that I have to use too much of it to get the desired effect.</li>
            <li>Absolute love</li>
            <li>After reading the reviews i wanted to try this conditioner and see if the reviews are true.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars though because it does make my hair nice and soft.</li>
            <li>Silk 18 leaves my hair feeling nice and soft.</li>
            <li>I personally used the conditioner and loved it.</li>
            <li>An absolute bargain - works much better than products that retail for 3 times the price.</li>
            <li>I rinse with cool water (makes</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t love this product as much as everyone else did.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Joking aside, I was looking for a really good conditioner to help with my roots, fraying split ends, and overall hair health.  </li>
            <li>Made my hair feel very silky and smooth too!</li>
            <li>She specifically did not use any styling product to see the true test between just shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>and i find myself having to use a bit of it as its a bit thick and doesn&#x27;t spread the best.</li>
            <li>I am always intrigued by products with so many 5 star reviews and then there are very polarized 1 star reviews.  </li>
            <li>After combing my tangled hair out I really had more split ends.  </li>
            <li>My hair really looks so healthy after applying a pea size amount.</li>
            <li>My hair looks almost as good as if i just left the salon.</li>
            <li>Despite that it works well and really does leave my hair feeling silky, my favorite part is the smell.</li>
            <li>The argan shampoo really smells like nothing which is ok.</li>
            <li>I had never heard of it before, but I liked that it was all natural.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling soft and the curls in nice frizz-free ringlets.  </li>
            <li>They leave it in such good shape.</li>
            <li>my hair, so far it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li>I will be ordering this again and again and the price is not bad at all for this quality product.  </li>
            <li>it is like crack but for your hair and not bad for you...</li>
            <li>I started noticing the difference in just 2-3 days - the conditioner I was using before made my hair very dry; this one helps retain the moisture much better!!</li>
            <li>This conditioner really helps smooth, soften and tame and it smells great too!  </li>
            <li>This is my new conditioner, it leaves my hair smelling so lovely as well as smooth and not brittle.</li>
            <li>I will have to say after trying so many different organic and natural brands, I think this one is my most favorite!</li>
            <li>SO far best product for my dry scalp issues.</li>
            <li>This conditioner has a light, pleasant scent and works well--it leaves my dry hair feeling smooth and soft, and my wintertime static is under control.</li>
            <li>Smells incredible &amp; really helps with dry hair.</li>
            <li>Being honest like you said never used any of these products but by Reading the reviews I would love to try I have dry hair</li>
            <li>It smells amazing and leaves my hair super soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many conditioners in the past, but this one is the best that I&#x27;ve found by far!  </li>
            <li>this is raly a good product made my hair very soft and not too much falling.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had them for 3 days and am so filled with joy that I FINALLY found a product that doesn&#x27;t leave my hair tacky or hard to brush, love the smell and truthfully, my very favorite is Silk 18.</li>
            <li>Overall the product itself is great, I can see why so many people have rated it highly and that is one of the reasons I decided to try it in the first place.</li>
            <li>Unlike various hair products, the Silk 18 is silicone free which is a huge thumbs up!!</li>
            <li>I purchased this conditioner along with the Hydrate shampoo for dry scalp and they have both been amazing!</li>
            <li>This is the best conditioner ever, I&#x27;m natural with super dry hair</li>
            <li>I was concerned at first, as my hair seemed knotty upon drying, but my comb glided easily through with no tugging.</li>
            <li>I have previously been using Beautiful Lengths conditioner</li>
            <li>that it has a pretty strong vanilla/sweet smell but others might like this</li>
            <li>It made de-tangling my hair pretty easy too.</li>
            <li>hair is left tangle free, shinny, and healthy!  </li>
            <li>I was so pleased with the Sage Shampoo that I was thrilled to learn about the companion Silk 18 conditioner and was willing for the first time in my adult life to buy a conditioner.</li>
            <li>Instead of feeling brittle, I&#x27;m enjoying how my hair feels soft, bouncy and healthy, even my old hair :)  </li>
            <li>It does a nice job of hydrating my curly hair and actually makes my curls soft and defined which is awesome especially in the humid months.</li>
            <li>Washes clean and got compliments on my hair the first time I used it!</li>
            <li>and I am going to try all of their other products too since my results have been great.</li>
            <li>I use this conditioner every day and my hair feels and looks great without a greasy texture like some other conditioners</li>
            <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li>Other than that, this is a great product and would recommend.</li>
            <li>The smell lingers for a day or two, so even if I don&#x27;t wash my hair everyday, my hair still smells good!</li>
            <li>First impression when I was in the shower and put some in my hand: liked that it wasn&#x27;t runny and was a good thick consistency but still easily spreadable through my hair</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>My hair feels light and healthy and super soft.</li>
            <li>Washing my hair with Silk 18 leaves it feeling clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>and my head felt totally fresh and clean</li>
            <li>I like the fresh clean scent .</li>
            <li>Super defined type 4 curls.</li>
            <li>used miss jessie&#x27;s super slip sudsy shampoo to start.</li>
            <li>Once the products came, I use them the night off and there was tremendous difference in softness and control.</li>
            <li>This conditioner moisturizes hair very well, and it makes for a great deep conditioner.</li>
            <li>Now I am even more pleased with Silk18, this stuff is such a life</li>
            <li>Now I am even more pleased with Silk18, this stuff is such a life saver!</li>
            <li>(but that&#x27;s prolly the shampoo) but works much better with my Pureology and now that I have faith I am definitely going to order the Argan Oil shampoo from Maple Holistics because I think it will work even better with that.</li>
            <li>I received my order quickly and upon use, immediately noticed a difference in my hair.  </li>
            <li>it has helped to prevent snarls and tangles tremendously.  </li>
            <li>I liked the conditioner, left hair feeling silky smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth noting I used this and the shampoo together twice and this by itself with Shea Moisture shampoo once, with the same results all three times: Gorgeous hair, but lots of lost hair in the shower and tons of shedding for days afterwards.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for something that is sulfate free and natural and healthy.  </li>
            <li>I love that it doesn&#x27;t contain harmful ingredients which is my main motivation for using it.</li>
            <li>This conditioner has a lovely scent to it, and it left my hair feeling healthy.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair super shiny and manageable and smooths the halo of frizz that humid summers can bring.</li>
            <li>I run out really quick bc</li>
            <li>It smells nice too, which is surprisingly rare among natural products.</li>
            <li>Thank you for these products and for Amazon that allowed me to find them and know that I will continue as a loyal customer.</li>
            <li>but it wears off quick</li>
            <li>and this helped me manage it tremendously and tamed my frizzes.</li>
            <li>I love the product, I only wish it were more affordable.</li>
            <li>Once I opened the bottle and that soothing vanilla fragrance permeated I quickly  </li>
            <li>This product does contain many moisturizing products, but nothing toxic or particularly worrisome.</li>
            <li>I am member of several hair forums and had written several post letting everyone know what a wonderful conditioner this is.</li>
            <li>I had been a loyal customer of Organix products throughout college,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s decent conditioner for sure</li>
            <li>I am super picky about conditioners.</li>
            <li>and it just leaves my hair super silky</li>
            <li>super</li>
            <li>Will buy more in the future :)</li>
            <li>i absolutely love this conditioner it makes my hair feel soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I am very impressed with this conditioner, I only wish it came it in a bigger bottle.</li>
            <li>but this has helped tremendously</li>
            <li>It has a nice, creamy texture, which I like, plus the fact that it has no sulfates is good for my thick, curly/wavy hair.</li>
            <li>I love this conditioner, has a wonderful fragrance and works very well for conditioning, I leave it on a little longer than normal to get the result I want.</li>
            <li>Right after I washed/conditioned my hair it felt rich.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product :)</li>
            <li>I love this conditioner, but the price is high.</li>
            <li>I love this conditioner and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I have looked a long time for a good healthy shampoo and conditioner, this is most definitely the one I have been searching for.  </li>
            <li>Love having soft hair!!</li>
            <li>Love natural products!!</li>
            <li>This has a pretty strong vanilla scent which I&#x27;m not crazy about.</li>
            <li>This is a very natural conditioner that contains some great oils , I will be trying their other products to find a more mild scented one for me.</li>
            <li>Does not weigh your hair down and has a light, pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>This conditioner is light and leaves my hair not only smelling great but feeling soft as well.</li>
            <li>When you use it for the first time you can feel a huge difference.</li>
            <li>My hair is moisturizer, smooth and so much healthier!</li>
            <li>I love the vanilla scent and even more, I love knowing that I&#x27;m not putting harsh chemicals into my hair.</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;ll be more effective for other hair types.</li>
            <li>However, I am very pleased with the conditioner overall &amp; will probably reorder.</li>
            <li>My hair is back to being very healthy</li>
            <li>I am VERY PLEASED and will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with this product and will continue to purchase in the future.</li>
            <li>For a conditioner that doesn&#x27;t cause cancer, this is pretty fantastic.</li>
            <li>and I finally found a natural shampoo that helps to nourish my hair with great ingredients while leaving it shiny, light and silky.</li>
            <li>I was excited to recieve this conditioner as I am trying to use more natural products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with the results and just ordered my second bottle.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff and wish there was a larger and more economical size.  </li>
            <li>The product is VERY reasonably priced for the results that it gives!  </li>
            <li>With the very first application,  my hair was  softer and silkier than it has been in years.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with SIlk18.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>Made my hair extremely smooth on the first use itself.</li>
            <li>It left my hair very healthy looking.</li>
            <li>I was comparing the ingredients list to the other conditioners, and by far this was the best.</li>
            <li>From just the first application it made my hair shiny and smooth and detangled.</li>
            <li>Ok I have the kind of hair that soaks up moisture and product like a WET VAC!  </li>
            <li>it worked good for my long ,thick,black hair</li>
            <li>are not natural, and some aren&#x27;t exactly good for you</li>
            <li>I like the smell of it afterwards too, it lasts for a long time and feels so good.  </li>
            <li>The smell is so-so; its a strong vanilla scent, but has a certain touch to it where it smells like a vanilla</li>
            <li>It is clean, soft, and has very pleasant vanilla aroma, and unlike other conditioners that take forever to wash off, this conditioner rinses off with ease.</li>
            <li>It smells great, like vanilla, and leaves my hair noticeabley silky without feeling weighed down.</li>
            <li>The product makes my hair look and fell great without weighing it down.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my 4 year old daughter who has very fine curly hair, that is prone to tangling.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine natural hair and after I get done using Silk 18 by Maple Holistics</li>
            <li>It has not felt so soft and strong in years!  </li>
            <li>I have searched high and low, and I WANT to find that great product that doesn&#x27;t cause me harm...</li>
            <li>With just one use, my hair felt brand new, silky, shiny &amp; healthy.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for 3 week now and it has become my new favorite.</li>
            <li>, we both love live it thank yoh</li>
            <li>I was using another new product at the time (a shampoo), so I wasn&#x27;t sure which was causing the problem.</li>
            <li>I will also experiment by using my clarifying shampoo paired with both the free and purchased product and show differences between this and the conditioner by Garnier - Brazilian Smooth and style as normal.</li>
            <li>I will also experiment by using my clarifying shampoo paired with both the free and purchased product and show differences between this and the conditioner by Garnier - Brazilian Smooth and style as normal.</li>
            <li>My skin is so much less itchy, my hair is great.  </li>
            <li>The highlights are damaging as is the color and damage is easily seen on my straight hair.  </li>
            <li>It can be very challenging to find a natural product that is reasonable and works well.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also using a dry oil spray that I found at Sallys and it is good too.</li>
            <li>I have a very dry,unruly and curly hair which frizzes so easily.</li>
            <li>I found this product on Amazon while searching for a really good conditioner for dry hair.  </li>
            <li>Made it here on time and in good shape, but it made my hair feel dry and brittle</li>
            <li>I have very wavy color-treated hair which frizzes easily.  </li>
            <li>I have dry scalp/thin hair and this conditioner gave a good lift and volume.</li>
            <li>I am thrilled because I know I will need to use the products several times in order to see true results.  </li>
            <li>My hair was very brittle and would break easily.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely loved it, the scalp isn&#x27;t dry anymore in the morning (heat season), the hair is shining.</li>
            <li>and I found it to be pretty good, but not necessarily a keeper.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a bit pricey but a little product goes a long way, I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase and will most probably will buy it again.</li>
            <li>saver!f my hair is EXTREMELY damaged from bleaching/straightening- the curls underneath formed thick, perfect ringlets and looked even better than my top layer...</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling very soft and healthy.</li>
            <li>[&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also don&#x27;t like being asked to review this positively to receive free items.</li>
            <li>and I love what it does for my naturally curly hair!  </li>
            <li>I still got several compliments on how healthy it looked!  </li>
            <li>This product, has left my hair in the best possible condition after the first time using it.  </li>
            <li>I love the fact that it is all natural and it smells yummy!</li>
            <li>After reading all the stellar reviews, I was excited to try this product.  </li>
            <li>After the first use of Silk 18 my hair felt soft, silky and LIGHT and i love the smell.  </li>
            <li>My hope is that this product will allow me to stop relying on a straightener so that my hair can heal- I will be updating this post later to update you guys on how the top layer looks after using this product in place of a straightener for awhile, and whether my relationship with blow dryers has improved!</li>

            <li>I LOVE this conditioner so far!</li>
            <li>Smells so awesome after the 2nd or 3rd time of use I could tell my hair is much much softer!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be back for more!</li>
            <li>Luckily, it&#x27;s not very expensive, and I think it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
            <li>It contains many natural ingredients so it has a lot of benefits!</li>
            <li>Really like the conditioner!!</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference after the first use!  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still getting consistent results, which is unique.</li>
            <li>I recommend this highly!!!</li>
            <li>Definitely plan on getting some more SOON!</li>
            <li>Thank you Maple Holistics for making a safe natural product!</li>
            <li>I started using this conditioner recently and absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>Love that is is all natural!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping also a plus!!</li>
            <li>Love that its natural and still does the job!  </li>
            <li>and I can comb right through it when it&#x27;s wet, and the smell is amazing!  </li>
            <li>I was super excited about this product because of the overwhelmingly positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>The best conditioner I&#x27;ve used thus far, can feel the difference from my previous conditioner to this one.</li>
            <li>Living in the heat of the South, we probably wash and dry our hair more than most.</li>
            <li>Just soft, smooth hair with no flyaways and no chemicals or strong fragrance.</li>
            <li>Silk 18 seems better than most store brands for helping manageability of my hair, even in the dry winter season.  </li>
            <li>My hair is super soft and love the vanilla smell.</li>
            <li>This conditioner is great my hair is really dry and can never found a conditioner that helps as much as this.</li>
            <li>:) Plus it makes my hair and my husbands hair super soft and it looks healthy...never greasy.</li>
            <li>I also liked the scent, not too much but enough, it has a light sweet almond smell.</li>
            <li>First, the aroma keeps my shower stall freshly scented; most importantly, this conditioner has thoroughly replenished the natural oils in my hair.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair very light feeling and soft.  </li>
            <li>I like the scent and my hair feels very soft, so overall I would say the product is great.</li>
            <li>Like very light smell and doesn&#x27;t make hair artificially soft or chemicalized.</li>
            <li>It is also all natural ingredients which is very important to me.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair very smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>No matter if they are new extensions or not, nothing leaves my hair feeling nice and silky, and I&#x27;ve used many different conditioners.</li>
            <li>I love this conditioner so much I am now using on my kids and their hair has never been so soft and easy to brush.  </li>
            <li>I used to have pencil straight, fine hair.</li>
            <li>conditioners don&#x27;t work on fine hair, especially those designed for fine hair, because they try to thicken the hair rather than simply smooth it.</li>
            <li>I tried this conditioner because I was looking for something that would work on my fine, straight hair.  </li>
            <li>hair is fine, straight, damaged, and dyed.</li>
            <li>But, I must say, it was perfect; it left my hair smooth and less frizzy.</li>
            <li>I am very naturalistic and enjoy that it is such a heathy way to condition my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The smell is wonderful, my hair is incredibly soft, and my curls are actually formed and soft rather than poofed out everywhere!</li>
            <li>I tried this product after trying many different products to control my frizzy fine hair.  </li>
            <li>This product has made my hair go from dry and unmanageable to silky and easy to style!!</li>
            <li>At first it did not seem special.</li>
            <li>Ordering a second bottle right away just to make sure I won&#x27;t ever run out of it!</li>
            <li>but It smells great and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling weighted down after blow drying or a co-wash!</li>
            <li>The smell is nice too, I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s too strong as other reviews say.</li>
            <li>there are wonderful vanilla and maple hues, and the scent is just the right amount of subtle when your hair dries (my boyfriend really likes it too!).</li>
            <li>It makes my hair smell amazing even a day later.  </li>
            <li>helping keep the frizz calm.</li>
            <li>I paid $ 400.00 for a keratin treatment and after switching from the real sulfate free shampoo to this one, my hair immediately changed.</li>
            <li>Works instantly and smells amazing.</li>
            <li>Stop rinsing when your hair is still very slippery and smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing that this condition contains all natural oils and gentle for your hair and scalp.</li>
            <li>I really, truly enjoy the product and plan to purchase the shampoo counterpart.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s extremely important that my conditioner is very detangling.</li>
            <li>My hair feels straight and frizz free.</li>
            <li>I did receive a sample of this product for free, but it doesn&#x27;t change that I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Been using this for the last two months and it is really amazing.</li>
            <li>(I have short hair) and my hair is in amazing shape in 10 days.</li>
            <li>The smell is so amazing it reminds me of amaretto and French vanilla coffee.</li>
            <li>This is a great product I have used it for a few years now</li>
            <li>Not only is their custom service amazing, but their products are a godsend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have to use as much as if I were using a cheap $3 conditioner.  </li>
            <li>It feels smooth and straight.</li>
            <li>It feels smooth and straight.</li>
            <li>After realizing that my grays have made dying my hair necessary more often than I would have liked, I decided to go natural with the all of my hair products.  </li>
            <li>My hair comes out very shiny and smooth but still has bounce and body.  </li>
            <li>Amazing I have blonde hair that is always dAmaged n</li>
            <li>This is an amazing product and defintely worth the price, plus I only have to wash my hair 1-2 a week using this</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair really soft, not heavy and love the scent, a real mild vanilla...</li>
            <li>For the price, its worth every cent.  </li>
            <li>Love products that are not harsh on my hair.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it&#x27;s 100% natural</li>
            <li>the silky texture of the conditioner did not make me lose any more hair than I naturally would have.  </li>
            <li>So far, I am pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>First things first, this stuff fantastic..</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li>This conditioner is absolutely my favorite natural conditioner.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After treating my hair ONE time, my hair was silky and soft again and my ends are healthy after one trim about a month ago.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>A product worth telling your friends and family about.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s all in fun</li>
            <li>but I think it&#x27;s worth mentioning.</li>
            <li>but I so far love it.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s natural and not overpowering like so many products on the market.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t completely fight my frizz, but I still love it.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a more natural product to use when I stumbled upon Maple Holistics products.  </li>
            <li>The Argan shampoo helps keep my hair soft, while I use the Degrease shampoo as more of a once-a-week clarifying shampoo.</li>
            <li>My hair feels truly healthy so far.</li>
            <li>I am a professional hairstylist for 15 years and have used MANY shampoo and conditioner products and out of ALL of them</li>
            <li>I have been trying to find a more natural conditioner and gave this a shot.  </li>
            <li>I really love that it is natural and organic.  </li>
            <li>Smells great and after only a couple uses my hair feels extremely soft.</li>
            <li>and I think this is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>The photo has no additional product just freshly washed and conditioned.</li>
            <li>I used SILK 18 as deep conditioner (covered with plastic shower cup and warm towel for 20 min).</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s kind of in the middle.</li>
            <li>I can not say how well it will work when the hot humid summer is in full swing.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone who wants a natural moisturizing conditioner with a warm vanilla scent.</li>
            <li>Can change drastically damaged hair into soft, shiny hair with body and lovely texture.  </li>
            <li>After searching quite a while for a Natural Conditioner that actually works I&#x27;m so happy to have found this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It makes her hair so soft and healthy without residue.</li>
            <li>It had become more manageable and frizz had reduced considerably.</li>
            <li>After switching to having more natural beauty products.</li>
            <li>I like the IDEA of what this company says they want to do here, which is to create a natural healthy conditioner.</li>
            <li>I have never been able to just wake up and walk out the door with my hair natural.</li>
            <li>It actually is quite smooth at the top.</li>
            <li>The smell is pretty sweet and does stick with you</li>
            <li>Alas, Silk is perfect for my hair</li>
            <li>ITS A BIT PRICEY BUT WORTH IT</li>
            <li>a bigger bottle would be nice, 2.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for relaxed hair but an okay produce for natural hair.</li>
            <li>And I love the scent, even though I&#x27;m sensitive to smells.</li>
            <li>, I was intrigued, and i realized that this product might really be worth it.</li>
            <li>I will say its worth trying.</li>
            <li>but I wanted something more natural.</li>
            <li>So far this is my favorite conditioner.</li>
            <li>and actually i l have a nice curl  from that.</li>
            <li>This was a great conditioner and left my hair soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>So worth the money, so worth it.</li>
            <li>and I love the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>my hair feels soft and more manageable.  </li>
            <li>It would be nice if they had larger sized bottles.</li>
            <li>I love that I can use a natural conditioner and get these results.  </li>
            <li>Love the fact that it has natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>I use it in the shower after shampooing on a daily basis, and then I use it twice a week as a deep conditioning treatment by wetting my hair with warm water, covering all my hair with the product, brush it through and then wrap it in a warm damp towel.  </li>
            <li>Pump action would be much better.</li>
            <li>you can tell it is being absorbed into your hair.  </li>
            <li>This natural conditioner did make my hair feel light silky smooth.</li>
            <li>The product has more than just natural ingredients, and in fact contains potassium sorbate.</li>
            <li>and it did a fantastic job at keeping my hair soft and smooth even after all of the stuff I had just put it through.</li>
            <li>I have been on the hunt for a natural shampoo and conditioner and after reading through many reviews decided upon Maple Holistics.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the price.  </li>
            <li>I personally think it smells like the warm brown sugar fragrance from Bath and Body Works.</li>
            <li>It seemed to have made my hair smoother and more manageable, however it wasn&#x27;t as soft as i imagined it to be.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for sulfate/paraben free products so that my hair will be soft, &amp;#34;un-wiry&amp;#34; and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I love this product it&#x27;s made my hair really soft and flexible.</li>
            <li>I just have to use another kind of deep conditioning treatment for the unruly curls and damaged ends once a week.</li>
            <li>It is all natural and safe on hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It leaves my hair extremely soft and smooth, it does a fantastic job of fighting the frizz</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is definitely worth it for the price</li>
            <li>Rarely a thought about conditioning my hair, etc.</li>
            <li>Through some searching, I came across Silk18 by Maple Holistics and was happy to see what it included (100% natural) and what it left out (no artificial fragrances, colors, and sulfates).</li>
            <li>Smells so good and leaves my hair soft but not limp.</li>
            <li>I hope that this information is useful to you and if it is then please click the helpful button.</li>
            <li>I was not even halfway through my old shampoo and conditioner bottles, but my hair was screaming at me to try something better.    </li>
            <li>I decided to order this product after reading reviews and I liked that they 100% back their products.  </li>
            <li>I am still unsure that it does absolute miracles for my hair, but it is definitely a plus in my book for the conditioner to contain ingredients that are truly good for my body.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>Instead it left my hair feeling smooth and healthy.  </li>
            <li>Worth the cost.</li>
            <li>When I start to use this conditioner, I noticed that my hair became more elastic and soft.</li>
            <li>I love it except I don&#x27;t get the smooth feeling I do after using regular shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>Love how soft my hair feels after using it.</li>
            <li>so I sought something more natural.</li>
            <li>I even tried lots of DIY recipes to make my own (same issue).  </li>
            <li>I love the smell, the feel, and natural approach of this conditioner.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t  say it&#x27;s worth the amount paid.</li>
            <li>but my hair are much much more shiner and soft</li>
            <li>I love that it is completely natural.</li>
            <li>It really has made my hair incredibly soft, and it has a really nice vanilla scent.</li>
            <li>and it makes my hair soft and more managable.</li>
            <li>I bought one for my sister because this is a finding worth sharing.</li>
            <li>I tried Silk 18 about 3 months ago because of the product reviews, figuring it would be worth a try...</li>
            <li>My hair is silky soft and hydrated and feels better than any product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>After leaving this conditioner in my hair for 5 minutes and rinsing it out, my hair has become amazingly soft and most of the frizz has disappeared.</li>
            <li>Love how this product is all natural. ...</li>
            <li>I have to say I&#x27;m presently surprised by the results, not only did the conditioner smell great</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ALWAYS looking for products that can make my hair healthy, shinning &amp; soft.  </li>
            <li>I also love natural vs chemicals.  </li>
            <li>Love this product leaves my hair so soft</li>
            <li>Made my hair soft and smooth!</li>
            <li>Just started using the conditioner about a week ago that my boyfriend (CHRIS) bought for me, so far I really love it.  </li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s so nice because it is such a &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Overall this is a nice shampoo</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I love all the fact that it&#x27;s all natural.  </li>
            <li>It would be even better if this product is 100% natural.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff, it makes my hair so silky and soft.</li>
            <li>This alone is worth a try.</li>
            <li>and so far I love this product.</li>
            <li>both my 12 year old daughter and I, age 50 are using this and the degrease shampoo and love them.</li>
            <li>and I love that it is natural.  </li>
            <li>i love that this is an all natural product.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t able to brush through my hair completely after using this product.</li>
            <li>I gave it four stars for it being natural and safe.</li>
            <li>I have used only one time, but so far I can already tell it&#x27;s a great product.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the way it made my hair feel so soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>and I can say it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>Love supporting small business, especially when the results are so great!</li>
            <li>This Natural Condition Silk 18 is OK.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a natural conditioner without many chemicals to use on my hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is curly and past my waist and this tames it beautifully.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s great to find a natural line without all the nasties that actually delivers.</li>
            <li>I am always on the look out for more natural products, and this is a keeper.</li>
            <li>Love the smell and makes my thins hair feel thicker and soft.</li>
            <li>I love that this is an all natural product</li>
            <li>Pricey for an 8z bottle but worth every penny</li>
            <li>Not only does it smell lovely, but I have genuinely noticed that my hair is softer, shinier, and easier to comb right out of the shower.</li>
            <li>It has a sweet but mild vanilla scent and leaves my hair soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a few other Maple Holistics hair products and was more than impressed with them.</li>
            <li>It smells great and  keeps my hair super soft even when I blow dry it.</li>
            <li>I still love it and will continue to use it because my hair still feels MUCH BETTER when compared to other conditioners I have used.</li>
            <li>I got some for christmas and wasn&#x27;t to sure about it since I have tried so many other ones that supposedly helped</li>
            <li>Tried various other conditioners but this showed best results.</li>
            <li>I only use organic products and was really excited about this - but Acure conditioner worked better for my hair.</li>
            <li>I love that it is sulfate free and the subtle vanilla scent is really nice.</li>
            <li>I could tell right away, my hair was lovely and smooth with just a quick blow dry.</li>
            <li>Not only does it work, but it smells good and for the first time in awhile my kids love getting their hair brushed!</li>
            <li>Leaves your hair feeling silky soft and super easy to comb out after shampooing and conditioning.</li>
            <li>Really glad I purchased this in combination with the Argan Oil Shampoo I also bought from Maple Holistics because that leaves my hair not only clean, but tangled.</li>
            <li>18 Conditioner makes blow drying a breeze; hair dries smooth, yet the product is not heavy; hair feels clean and vibrant!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty happy with this product, since my hair felt a little bit stronger after one use.  </li>
            <li>I flat ironed with my Chi and the results were amazing without using any additional products.  </li>
            <li>what seems like aloe juice, and a bunch of other good ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My wife is biracial with fantastic color and curls, but if you won&#x27;t give basic info to your customers willing to spend top dollar, you don&#x27;t deserve a penny.</li>
            <li>I have tried this ONE time and am so very pleased at the instant softness and shine using only a nickle size drop for hair that is to the top of my shoulders in length.  </li>
            <li>Great all natural conditioner and not expensive at all when compared to similar products.  </li>
            <li>I used it right away after I received it.</li>
            <li>right now-</li>
            <li>you can see the difference right away</li>
            <li>price is right---</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference right away after using this product.  </li>
            <li>but it was just right.</li>
            <li>this conditioner doesn&#x27;t grease your hair and it gives it the right amount of shine.</li>
            <li>SILK is the right name for this product.</li>
            <li>It soaked right into my hair when I rinsed it out my hair</li>
            <li>this is amazing, I did not like it at first actually</li>
            <li>I use a cheap box dye on my long hair and this just made it look so shiny and healthy and it feels and smells like heaven, too.</li>
            <li>and I pretty much lost hope of having touchable, smooth hair.</li>
            <li>First, I love that it is all natural with no suspicious chemicals.</li>
            <li>I am always looking for the most natural yet effective product for my dry hair and this is it.</li>
            <li>The difference was dramatic; I was very impressed.  </li>
            <li>And I love that it&#x27;s pretty natural.</li>
            <li>although this conditioner does that pretty well on its own, my hair is fussy), blow dry with cool air and then straighten to seal the follicles.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure exactly of it&#x27;s ingredients but something that strong couldn&#x27;t be good.</li>
            <li>I used both products last night for the first time, and I really liked them.</li>
            <li>I was at first a little hesitant because the vanilla aroma in the bottle was quite strong, but once on my hair it toned down to a very gentle kind of aroma which was very nice.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice silky smooth texture and left my feeling very soft.  </li>
            <li>Because of the different textures it tangles very easily</li>
            <li>The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the smell of the shea butter is very strong.</li>
            <li>This is hands down an excellent product and the only hair conditioner I will ever use!!      </li>
            <li>This stuff is awesome,after the first use I knew I found something that is honesty made and does exactly what it claims to do!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Maple Holistic products!!!;)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a few different products from Maple Holistics and have been impressed with most so far</li>
            <li>Definitely recommend this product, feels great to use something that is more natural for your hair that actually works!</li>
            <li>Not only is it much more natural and absent of harmful chemicals, but it has a very light vanilla smell that doesn&#x27;t overpower perfume/cologne and is quite soothing.</li>
            <li>Another plus - my husband and I loved the scent.&lt;br /&gt;However, as far as actual performance goes - I only liked it.</li>
            <li>which over time just dry out your hair on top of coating it!  </li>
            <li>Made my dry ends look and feel healthy and shiny after just one use!</li>
            <li>This conditioner has transformed my unmanageable hair from frizzy and dry to healthy looking!</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s straight anyways), and for special occasions I might straighten it (maybe max.</li>
            <li>It is made a huge difference with my dry hair and given my hair a shine and more volume.  </li>
            <li>It also keeps my hair static free during the dry winter months, which is why I wanted to this conditioner to begin with.</li>
            <li>Lovely vanilla smell that lightly lingers on dry hair.</li>
            <li>I have only found two shampoos/conditioners that help keep my hair smooth, moisturized and shiny and even easy to brush through.</li>
            <li>Although, the cluster of all positive reviews all on the same days as one another was suspicious, and honestly made me think twice about this</li>
            <li>I have used it once and can honestly say I have never had such a positive result with any product.</li>
            <li>And lastly, it has a lovely, soft sent. :-)</li>
            <li>Pairs great with their Sage Shampoo for Heavy Dandruff!</li>
            <li>am also happy with the natural ingredients, it is important to me to stay away from harsh detergents/SLS/parabens/synthetic fragrances in my skin/body care.</li>
            <li>It is a bit too sweet and didn&#x27;t really like the container.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice any vanilla really, just a syrupy sweet smell that lingered FOREVER.</li>
            <li>I recently purchased this product and I was totally surprised and, of course, very happy with the results, having only used it three times.  </li>
            <li>The vanilla smell is powerful at first but has a calming aroma afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;18</li>
            <li>I admit I first thought it was pricey but after using it I do feel it is worth it.</li>
            <li>I thought to myself, if the Argan left my hair this soft surely &amp;#34;Silk&amp;#34; 18 would be even better.  </li>
            <li>(I use an Argon curl cream, so I&#x27;m sure going to give them a review and some of this credit!)&lt;br /&gt;*sulfate-free - my hair dresser has been on me for a long time to move to sulfate free, yet anytime I&#x27;ve tried anything s-free, I absolutely couldn&#x27;t stand it!  </li>
            <li>Well worth a try, and if you don&#x27;t like it, their return policy is stellar.</li>
            <li>I bought this conditioner to replace my drugstore brand &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; conditioner because it had not been working that great the past couple weeks</li>
            <li>I have tried several conditioners and this one is the best by far (even when compared to the so-called regular ones).    </li>
            <li>The price is pretty good considering other brands out there</li>
            <li>I will def continue using this on my daughter&#x27;s hair and will try it on my own long hair once my Pureology runs out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for this kind of product for a long time.</li>
            <li>Make sure you leave it on for at least 2 minutes to get the most silkiness!</li>
            <li>But because it&#x27;s fine, it gets weighed down very easily.</li>
            <li>I used it along with the Argan Oil Shampoo, but the shampoo leaves my hair at first clean but very tangled.  </li>
            <li>Surprisingly the product did not leave my hair greasy or weighed down.</li>
            <li>However it smells good and it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down or make it greasy looking</li>
            <li>This conditioner works wonders, making my hair feel silky and shiny without weighing it down, and I feel good about putting it on my head.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair manageable to brush right out of the shower and leaves it feeling smooth and light, without adding any build up back into my hair.</li>
            <li>The product finally made my hair feel silky and allowed easy stretching!</li>
            <li>Size is a little smaller than I was expecting for the price, but the product is wonderful.</li>
            <li>Not only does it smell amazing, but it also makes my hair very soft and full of life.</li>
            <li>I like that this company seems to work hard at producing healthier alternative products by using the best natural ingredients.available.</li>
            <li>I felt like I had to use a bit more than expected to cover my hair, which is fine, but I wish there were bigger bottles available because I might end up running through this one pretty quickly!</li>
            <li>Now, it&#x27;s the perfect amount of shiny, soft and managable without being greasy like some other natural conditioners made it.</li>
            <li>I have dry curly hair and it works amazing on my hair.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing product for dry hair.  </li>
            <li>When I think of my hair staying beautiful and long lasting results it matters to me.</li>
            <li>The smell is delightful, the conditioner is thick, and it leaves my hair soft, silky, and never greasy.</li>
            <li>I am extremely happy with this product and only wish they sold it in a much larger size.</li>
            <li>It contains good ingredients that not only feeds my hair, but naturally moisturizes and tames my persistent frizz.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a great deep conditioning treatment, and this one definitely works for me.</li>
            <li>It is nice that not too much of it needs to be used each time so the bottle will last you quite a while.</li>
            <li>Based on my experience with this conditioner, I would reccomend it to anyone who wants a safe and natural option to protect their hair.</li>
            <li>Making sure that I rinse real well and boom, soft shiny and silky hair.</li>
            <li>I really like the idea of natural ingredients, which is better for our health.</li>
            <li>And I feel really good about using a product from a smaller company with a focus on using natural ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Truly good smelling conditioner that leaves my coarse hair feeling soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>I am constantly on the hunt for good products for naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>and I comfirmed that Silk 18 Natural Conditioner repairs my dameged hair very quickly.</li>
            <li>Shockingly great on my relaxed african American hair</li>
            <li>Its a kind of miracle for my dry and tangle prone hair.</li>
            <li>I have a 2 year old daughter that has hair that tangles easily.</li>
            <li>This product leaves my hair soft, easy to brush through and style.</li>
            <li>Amazon shipped it super fast</li>
            <li>So...I went back to using the only great shampoo that seems to leave my hair on my head, instead of in the sink and the drain, and</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t really much of a scent to the conditioner, which is nice, and you only have to use about a quarter sized amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve rarely let my hair grow out for more than several months,</li>
            <li>This conditioner keeps my hair hydrated, soft, shiny and easy to comb.</li>
            <li>After I got out of the shower I let it air dry, it seemed like it was drying nicely, but then I woke up</li>
            <li>However when I use this my hair becomes soft and easy to maintain.</li>
            <li>Super silky without being greasy, shiny, healthier looking, and much easier to style.  </li>
            <li>This product came with such amazing reviews and I have to say it does work very well</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 40 years old &amp; have spent a great deal of that time &amp; a lot of money to find a product to help with this hair-curse Mother Nature gave me.</li>
            <li>It has an amazing smelling soft vanilla scent and completely detangles my hair.  </li>
            <li>It smells good, my hair is so soft, and I only need about a quarter size and that&#x27;s PLENTY.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying this again, its a great product from a holistic seller local to me.</li>
            <li>Some thongs helped my scalp and left my hair a disaster or aggravated my scalp condition and left my hair feeling great.</li>
            <li>, there&#x27;s a lot less frizz going on, and I feel like my waves have been enhanced in a good way.</li>
            <li>As some know, our hair type gets really dry,really quickly, but this conditioner has given me hope.  </li>
            <li>new hair care staple!!!</li>
            <li>I have very course dry hair and this product made my hair very soft and smelled great made my hair stronger</li>
            <li>The scent is amazing and the quality is excellent, however I have very dry and very thick and very damaged color treated hair</li>
            <li>I let it air dry without adding a drop of any other products and my curls were beautiful and frizz free.</li>
            <li>Makes your hair super soft!!!</li>
            <li>I was thrilled to see that I could put a comb through my hair after using these products and not catch a single tangle.</li>
            <li>The last two days, however, I&#x27;ve had to use VERY LITTLE product and my hair smells great and looks healthy and has a &#x27;shine&#x27; to it.  </li>
            <li>The conditioner has a light scent and leaves hair soft!</li>
            <li>It was great for my long tangled hair and left my hair smelling fresh all day.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for the right conditioner for my type of hair and I am glad to say that I have finally found it.</li>
            <li>I went right back on amazon and ordered 3 more bottles in fear that the sale will be ending soon.</li>
            <li>I have very super fine hair and damaged from blow dry.  </li>
            <li>I always use high quality shampoo and conditioner because I have long curly hair, which tends to be dry and have had fairly good results, but this stuff is the bomb!!  </li>
            <li>This by far has left my hair in an amazing condition and I love how it&#x27;s all natural</li>
            <li>The Sage shampoo does not cause build-up yet, it is very gentle.</li>
            <li>This is a very high quality hair product!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to use very much of the product to get its intended results.</li>
            <li>Very gentle to my hair</li>
            <li>but I dye it very light blonde</li>
            <li>I like both very much.</li>
            <li>After four uses, I like this conditioner very much.</li>
            <li>What I don&#x27;t care for is the VERY VERY vanilla smell.  </li>
            <li>This conditioner blows almost all of them out of the water, and is very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>Very fast shipper.</li>
            <li>Thank you so very much</li>
            <li>This conditioner left my hair feeling very smooth, even silky.  </li>
            <li>This, along with the Hydrate shampoo, made my hair so silky, and I did not have to use very much at all.  </li>
            <li>I had such high hopes for this, due to all the wonderful reviews</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s important to say that the top of my hair is EXTREMELY damaged from bleaching/</li>
            <li>I have fine, mature hair that is curly and frizzy.</li>
            <li>I have only been able to use it a few times but my hair already feels soft and smooth and the smell is amazing!</li>
            <li>Overall I am very pleased with this product so far and can&#x27;t wait to see what the continued use will do for my hair!</li>
            <li>The conditioner leaves my hair light and airy, perhaps more than any other conditioner I have used.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>My fine highlighted hair feel silky and shiny  and feel so soft to touch even after drying them with a fan this morning.</li>
            <li>Perhaps it depends on hair type (mine is baby fine and naturally wavy/curly), or water source.</li>
            <li>price is not bad either, for a conditioner that has decent ingredients.</li>
            <li>Love live live what my hair is looking like now</li>
            <li>(I have medium length), but I was able to brush through my hair much more easily than with any other product of conditioner I have used in the past (with more product to even get the same effect that Silk 18 is able to do too).</li>
            <li>Good conditioner and a little is all you need</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited about this new product</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s unruly, it frizzes easily, and it&#x27;s a huge hassle if I don&#x27;t do something with it and let it dry au naturale.</li>
            <li>Combined with the Tea Tree Oil Shampoo with rosemary and lavender, a clean fresh soft feeling.</li>
            <li>And I love the scent (as does my boyfriend) - nice subtle vanilla.</li>
            <li>My hair needs the extra TLC, but overall good smell not overpowering love that its holistic and does make my hair more manageable and less frizzy,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad smell, just different, as I prefer fresh, clean smelling hair products.</li>
            <li>It is strong at first but slightly fades during the duration of the day with a lingering scent of vanilla that I love.</li>
            <li>Many conditioners tend to weigh my fine hair down, not this one.  </li>
            <li>Right now I am loving it and am looking forward to trying other products.</li>
            <li>It is a little pricey compared to drugstore brands, but the quality and great natural ingredients make it totally worth it.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing and makes my hair so soft and easy to brush wet!</li>
            <li>I would like to use only this conditioner from now on, but the cost is too high, so I will alternate between this and something more cost effective.</li>
            <li>I only wish it was sold in huge bottles!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ever used not to mention much healthier!</li>
            <li>I was scared to buy only because so many products are greasy.</li>
            <li>, it isn&#x27;t bulky, it helps the hair absorb moisture while drying, and allows me to focus on the first thing that I work on in the mornings post shower....</li>
            <li>The smell is heaven, reminds me of my vacation in Las Vegas, my hotel room smelled exactly like it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m almost done with my first bottle and have to say my hair has improved 10 fold</li>
            <li>My hair is so soft, smooth, manageable, and shiny.</li>
            <li>I wondered maybe the first time was coincidental</li>
            <li>I can only say that I love the results.</li>
            <li>Because this product is so natural and free of Sulfate</li>
            <li>, that been said, I am never 100% satisfied by any of them, to the point that I combined different ones that I like to get that silky feel</li>
            <li>left my hair incredibly soft and silky and most importantly without frizz.</li>
            <li>This product is great for thick hair.</li>
            <li>It leaves your hair feeling very refreshed!</li>
            <li>Even my ends of my hair are much softer!</li>
            <li>It made my hair soft and free of tangles ...</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>My only issue is that I am using more of the conditioner to fully work into my hair than I am of the shampoo.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I used this condtioner</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more and recommending this conditioner to my family and friends.</li>
            <li>Used it for the first time and never experience itchiness or any allergic reaction, I have seborrheic dermatitis/psoriasis</li>
            <li>I have blonde hair and when I get my roots touched up, we use bleach which I&#x27;m sure you all know how damaging that can be.  </li>
            <li>and this stuff really helped me!</li>
            <li>Love this product, and can&#x27;t say enough about it.</li>
            <li>First of all, the scent is heavenly.</li>
            <li>Love this conditioner, PLEASE consider making it larger oz.</li>
            <li>AND I noticed right away that I didn&#x27;t have large amounts of hair falling out anymore</li>
            <li>-really!</li>
            <li>First impression</li>
            <li>This is the first I tried this product.</li>
            <li>First of all, I like the smell (vanilla scent).  </li>
            <li>First of all, I am including pictures on a review for the first time ever because 1.)</li>
            <li>but damn I just love being blonde!)</li>
            <li>I really cannot believe the difference!</li>
            <li>Used it for the first time.</li>
            <li>Like it it make my hair look pretty and silky</li>
            <li>so I went on a search for a similar but more hydrating product</li>
            <li>I am pretty darn picky when it comes to conditioners</li>
            <li>My teenage daughter and I love this conditioner.</li>
            <li>though I would give this one a try as it was promoted as natural and sulfate free.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used this product and felt it in my hair</li>
            <li>and I will update and also leave a separate review  on the shampoo (it will most likely be another month before I</li>
            <li>This is the first conditioner I have used where I don&#x27;t need gobs of it to feel like I have covered my hair.</li>
            <li>I really like this product!</li>
            <li>First, I attempted to use it as a detangler for my 4b curls.</li>
            <li>~) And if you like the Tresemme conditioner then you will absolutely looooove this!</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing more in the future!</li>
            <li>I re ordered a third bottle to make sure I keep it in stock.</li>
            <li>love it as a deep condition/leave in/regular condition/</li>
            <li>That being said, this conditioner smells absolutely heavenly!</li>
            <li>Will definitely buy again  :)</li>
            <li>It looks much healthier!</li>
            <li>I will definitely be trying more products by maple holistics.</li>
            <li>I have been using Silk 18 for almost two weeks now and my hair feels so much healthier!  </li>
            <li>Updated to 5 stars because we like it that much!  </li>
            <li>and it turned out really soft and light and shiny.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s pretty worrisome, but thankfully the hairline isn&#x27;t receding yet.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I try this brand</li>
            <li>It gives my hair a healthier look, and my hair feels softer after the first use.  </li>
            <li>My hair finally stopped shedding and its once again healthy.</li>
            <li>Well, after learning more about the type of chemicals that are lurking in our products and doing thorough research on various products on Environmental Working Group&#x27;s site - including line by line on this product - I decided that I would take the plunge on this</li>
            <li>The only downside is the scent, it&#x27;s more musk-like than vanilla.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s better again.&lt;br /&gt;Today I also ordered a shampoo by the same company, let&#x27;s see if it saves the situation.</li>
            <li>And that&#x27;s exactly what it did.</li>
            <li>It felt soft and smooth even after the first use.</li>
            <li>The first time I tried this conditioner, I did not like it.</li>
            <li>and it is naturally kind of rough</li>
            <li>When I&#x27;m out, I&#x27;ll be back for more.</li>
            <li>It is refreshing to come across a product that actually does what it says!</li>
            <li>I noticed a change in the texture of my hair after using it for the first time.  </li>
            <li>I used it for the first time yesterday</li>
            <li>It is warm and inviting and very soothing after a long day.</li>
            <li>This may not be appropriate for someone with thinner hair, but I benefit from some extra weight.</li>
            <li>okay let&#x27;s try this and after about 2nd week</li>
            <li>For the first time I have found a conditioner I am willing to purchase again and again.</li>
            <li>I can see results at first use.</li>
            <li>I believe that it really helps my hair to recover and be all well!</li>
            <li>All in all, I&#x27;m satisfied with this conditioner and will definitely be purchasing more in the future.</li>
            <li>The fact that it is vegan and all natural is why I bought it, but the results were fabulous.</li>
            <li>At first I was thinking this was a bit pricey -</li>
            <li>Will definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li>but with this one, I&#x27;m using about a quarter size, maybe a squeeze more, and getting the same results.  </li>
            <li>and I am always looking for products to leave my hair soft and frizz free, this product do the job.</li>
            <li>review was NOT paid for or compensated in any way; I&#x27;m actually just writing it because I&#x27;m so in love with this product.</li>
            <li>My last bottle of conditioner was okay</li>
            <li>Even after washing it out, my hair feels pretty well moisturized.</li>
            <li>The shine is back in her hair and it is much more manageable.  </li>
            <li>I recommend for any hair type and smell is absolutely  scrumptious for Men or Women!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t found a better conditioner since I stopped using commercial products.</li>
            <li>not in love with the smell, it does work (detangles, conditions), but did not notice a giant difference in hair.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love these products and will continue to buy them in the future.</li>
            <li>I like this conditioner which makes my hair soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this product, and will definitely consider purchasing another bottle when this one is gone.</li>
            <li>I use a a quarter-size amount and the first time</li>
            <li>I will be back for more .....</li>
            <li>with humidity this conditioner does exactly what it says it will do!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this conditioner!</li>
            <li>Just tried it with a Neutrogena shampoo and it worked pretty well considering the fact that the Neutrogena shampoo is a dandruff shampoo</li>
            <li>For the first time, my hair wasn&#x27;t frizzy.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many different products because my hair has been fried from coloring it so many different times (and colors).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely buy more when I run out.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have to use a whole lot!</li>
            <li>FAST SHIPPING!</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>It smells fantastic and leaves my hair feeling soft and silky.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using the product for a couple days, but I already love how it smells.</li>
            <li>I feel like it can only get better at this point.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this conditioner and plan on purchasing more in the future.</li>
            <li>My regular conditioner (tresseme platinum strength) works better than this.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li>During pregnancy and breastfeeding, I went completely natural and toxin free.</li>
            <li>This one leaves my hair pretty silky and moisturized.</li>
            <li>Considering I only wash my hair 3 times a week, though, it has lasted me longer than it would for most people.  </li>
            <li>and it has really improved my hair!</li>
            <li>I have tried several conditioners but have to say that I am extremely pleased to have found this product.  </li>
            <li>Even after air drying, my hair is still soft and smooth, as if I put silicone in it.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff and definitely will buy it again!!</li>
            <li>I have used so many products on my hair, I try multiple throughout the year on a quest to find something that works.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it does a better job than run of the mill conditioners like Pantene or what have you, but it definitely does the job without all those chemicals, which is what attracted me to it in the first place.</li>
            <li>First off  </li>
            <li>This conditioner is worth three times as much.  </li>
            <li>I am definitely going to buy a lot more of this conditioner.  </li>
            <li>So my hair has been abused recently, but still I don&#x27;t like to use conditioners with cones in them and this is lovely.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I&#x27;ve been searching for and has no scary chemicals.</li>
            <li>So glad I finally found my brand, woohoo!!</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s going to love hearing about this stuff - and she buys quite regularly for her shelf products from Amazon</li>
            <li>I can clearly see my hair better, much smoother, much softer.</li>
            <li>so i will definitely be purchasing it through here more often.</li>
            <li>I hope the results &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34;, as I don&#x27;t think one has to buy lots of different products to maintain healthy hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it twice now and can definitely say that it is fantastic!</li>
            <li>I shampoo and condition my hair first</li>
            <li>Leaves hair very silky and tames the frizz!</li>
            <li>I have just finished up my first bottle of this product.</li>
            <li>but this may not work for everyone, so test it first on your hair type.&lt;br</li>
            <li>OMG this is the first time everrrr....</li>
            <li>At first it didnt seem to be working</li>
            <li>so it likely wouldnt get better overnight.  </li>
            <li>and I found this one recently which works magic on my hair.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li>Looking forward to Maple Holistics future offerings - hopefully a better complement to their Sage shampoo is forthcoming.</li>
            <li>Overall this product is named appropriately.</li>
            <li>First, there is not gluten (wheat germ or oats), a must for me.</li>
            <li>Anytime I use a different conditioner I fall in love with this one all over again.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair so silky and really helps with frizz!</li>
            <li>I used this conditioner for the first time today and man</li>
            <li>This is the first time in my life that I didn&#x27;t have to add a oil or cream for frizz after I shampooed.</li>
            <li>I just received those samples today and they are a very generous (1.5 fl oz)!  </li>
            <li>I also installed a vitamin c shower head filter with a flexible hose a week after installing the first shower filter after reading about them and what the vitamin c does for your hair and skin.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel even better than a deep conditioning.</li>
            <li>Now if I could only get a bit more for my money...</li>
            <li>My hair is shiny, frizz free and soft</li>
            <li>I will definitely be purchasing more.</li>
            <li>but, after many months with a thyroid disorder, has grown in grainy, kinky, and coarse.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried of many different conditioners and masks</li>
            <li>First of all it should come with directions.</li>
            <li>And here&#x27;s a random fact--this stuff makes the best shaving cream ever!</li>
            <li>It is also already so much softer after just one use!</li>
            <li>Each time I use it, my hair soaks the conditioner up, so I feel it will only get better with extended</li>
            <li>but I can see why some guys have reviewed this as smelling too &amp;#34;girly&amp;#34;).  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t find that it performs any better than my L&#x27;Oreal conditioner, and the L&#x27;Oreal is only a fraction of the price.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This conditioner has a gentle and fresh scent, and my curls are formed and not frizzy.  </li>
            <li>It is sulfate free and all natural.</li>
            <li>Hope this helps ;)</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li>Overall, my hair now looks better, my scalp feels healthier</li>
            <li>Highly recommend using!!  </li>
            <li>I bought the shampoo and conditioner for her as the sulfate free products coupled with oils are what is needed to keep curly hair soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>and I am very picky about what I use on my 3A curly hair!  </li>
            <li>I really like this product!</li>
            <li>Itchiness become unbearable with more use and red spots become visible.  </li>
            <li>I believe they currently do have some discount for buying more than one bottle</li>
            <li>I am so interested in trying this.</li>
            <li>We bought our first bottle based on revews.</li>
            <li>I used Degrease the first month</li>
            <li>Will be ordering more in the future!!</li>
            <li>My hair feels soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s all natural, free of harmful chemicals, and actually works.  </li>
            <li>My hair was straighter, bouncier and shinier after the first use.</li>
            <li>Only had to use a small amount and worked great!!</li>
            <li>After letting my stylist talk me into bleaching out sections of my hair for the first time in 14 years, my hair was feeling just about like straw post treatment.</li>
            <li>I feel like I&#x27;m using a much higher end product and the compliments from my husband as to the look and feel of my hair don&#x27;t hurt either.</li>
            <li>Thanks, Maple Holistics!</li>
            <li>it is definitely one of the better conditioners I have tried.</li>
            <li>Really like this conditioner!</li>
            <li>Natural conditioner by Maple Holistics sulfate free.</li>
            <li>Did not find this product to be particularly better than others especially after factoring its pricing.</li>
            <li>This is a crappy conditioner covered with marketing buzzwords to makes one feel crunchy and environmentally aware.</li>
            <li>Maybe it works better on somebody with short hair but def not for me.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is really natural, light, not overbearing and</li>
            <li>This is my first Maple Holistics purchase and I&#x27;m floored by the quality of this conditioner.</li>
            <li>And I did  not give up until I found exactly what I was looking for: Maple Holistics and their products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also using a natural, sulfate free shampoo in combination and I would recommend everyone do this.</li>
            <li>I get the more coarse and curly my hair has become.  </li>
            <li>If only you could get alittle more.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff and am definitely going to try one of their shampoos</li>
            <li>For the price I really don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with the instant difference this shampoo and conditioner made.</li>
            <li>At first I tried this conditioner</li>
            <li>I use it with the shampoo and overall my hair seems more moisturized.</li>
            <li>, my hair is soft, frizz free</li>
            <li>and I could tell it was helping from the first use</li>
            <li>I almost always use natural/organic hair products, but this is the first time I&#x27;ve actually been able to notice a difference in how my hair feels.  </li>
            <li>I bought this conditioner along with the argan shampoo (which sadly didn&#x27;t work for me) and it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not heavy and it&#x27;s not too light</li>
            <li>My hair was soft and tangle free.</li>
            <li>I had started developing a static problem that prompted me to change shampoo and conditioner to this brand and that is entirely eliminated.  </li>
            <li>I  really enjoy the natural vanilla scent as well; I wish they would add it to the shampoo.</li>
            <li>Seemed like the perfect product ... until I noticed something unsettling.  </li>
            <li>After the first shampoo and conditioning treatment I see a difference.</li>
            <li>Her first application</li>
            <li>When I have more time in the morning I will actually apply this conditioner and wrap my hair up</li>
            <li>cause its got good ingredients and sulfate, sodium chloride, dyes, harsh salts, parabens and gluten</li>
            <li>Squeaky clean and very soft.</li>
            <li>My hair is dry, frizzy, damaged and breaks off very easily.  </li>
            <li>First of all I&#x27;m a cosmetologist that has access to all the professional products and have tried many and always looking for new ones at the beauty supply.</li>
            <li>I have very fine long hair, prone to frizz and dryness - this conditioner works wonders.</li>
            <li>I have fairly long, color treated hair that is very fine</li>
            <li>I have very fine and often tangled long hair.</li>
            <li>but I am very excited to try different products from this line after my first experience.</li>
            <li>After only a few uses, this is remarkable!  </li>
            <li>\\&quot;I really enjoy this conditioner, I tried many different homemade all natural shampoos and conditioners, and never had positive results.</li>
            <li>My fussy hair goes super smooth after only one time using the product.</li>
            <li>I went from needing to use so much product to leaving my hair to naturally dry and look amazing.</li>
            <li>My hair feels softer, shinier, and more important, less frizzy.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth buying, made my hair super soft and</li>
            <li>My hair has always been really dry, so I was looking for a good, natural conditioner.</li>
            <li>I use this with the Tea Tree Shampoo for moderate dandruff with argan and jojoba offered by Maple holistics, and my hair feels very clean and soft ... and dandruff free.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very excited to see what the future hold for my tresses with continued use!</li>
            <li>I have paid much more for other products with poor results, I am very happy to have discovered this companies hair products.</li>
            <li>Still very soft, I am in love with this product now, plus it didn&#x27;t bother my sensitive hands.  </li>
            <li>Received my silk 18 conditioner and was pleasantly satisfied, smooths my frizzy ends, leaves my natural hair very soft &amp; moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>For some people this conditioner alone works just fine, but for my hair I feel like I need a little bit more</li>
            <li>Love this conditioner, sweet vanilla scent with some other herbs and stuff.  </li>
            <li>My hair is left soft, shiny, and smelling FANTASTIC!!</li>
            <li>And then the next day when I did the shampoo followed by Silk 18, holy leaping cow - I can honestly say I LOVE this conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I super recommend this product for normal hair like mine.</li>
            <li>Smells so good and helps me tame frizzies.</li>
            <li>Its scent is barely there, not too strong.  </li>
            <li>Has good &#x27;slip&#x27; for a natural product that isn&#x27;t full of silicones like cheaper conditioners that only make your hair feel good temporarily but make it worse over time.  </li>
            <li>This conditioner not only smells great (a not over powering vanilla scent), but works like no other natural conditioner I have ever tried.</li>
            <li>the record, I have thin, fine hair, that needs a good washing about three times a week...</li>
            <li>After using it a couple of times, I don&#x27;t see or feel any difference in my very long, very fine, chemically treated hair..  </li>
            <li>It is hard to find the right balance, but I think this product does an amazing job of delivering just the right amount of moisture!</li>
            <li>I have hightlights in my hair ( very fine hair), and it gets a bit frizzy and dry after its highlighted.</li>
            <li>Other than that this conditioner is amazing.</li>
            <li>The ingredient deck is AWESOME (minus containing Alcohol a little premature in Ingrd. deck )</li>
            <li>you can have soft, silky hair without all the chemicals in this great little bottle.</li>
            <li>It really leaves my fine hair which tends to be dry and frizzy, silky smooth and manageable.</li>
            <li>My natural hair color looks darker and rich.</li>
            <li>This is not usually a scent I go for because it smells sweet</li>
            <li>I am only on my second use though and my hair feels pretty good.</li>
            <li>Because of this conditioner my hair is full, smooth, shiny, thick, healthy and bouncy.</li>
            <li>but this doesn&#x27;t give me any kind of irritation or any other bothersome outcome</li>
            <li>My daughter and I have completely different hair types; hers is super course and curly and mine is fine and straight.  </li>
            <li>and I figured why not try something new since I&#x27;ve loved Maple Holistics other products.</li>
            <li>I have very dry scalp and have tried practically every shampoo and conditioner on the market, and this is by far the best I have tried, I started using the silk18 about 1 month ago with the Sage shampoo and my dry scalp is gone.</li>
            <li>Works very well for me, makes my hair softer, but doesn&#x27;t help control my frizzyness very much, the smell is pretty neutral too me.</li>
            <li>I have pretty coarse hair and this stuff smoothed it out beautifully without weighing it down or leaving it looking greasy.</li>
            <li>This conditioner is a fantastic product, makes your hair soft without weighing it down and it leaves a nice scent.</li>
            <li>The only reason I give it 4 stars is because my hair doesn&#x27;t feel quite as soft after it dries, however, that could very well simply be attributed to my fine, blond hair that seems to get a dry and tangled no matter how wonderful the product is!</li>
            <li>You now have a new loyal costumer ☺️5 Stars</li>
            <li>It really keeps my hair soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>This product is very good......makes my hair frizz free and soft.</li>
            <li>my  long hair is now  naturally shiny and very healthy...</li>
            <li>Silk 18 has a great, subtle aroma.</li>
            <li>Really leaves my hair silky smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>I received this along with my maple holistics tea tree dandruff shampoo earlier than expected, which was great.</li>
            <li>I only used it a couple of times but so far this conditioner is amazing.</li>
            <li>So, I will continue to use this conditioner as it works great ... just be careful on what shampoo you use prior to it.</li>
            <li>My hair feels so clean without feeling stripped of its natural oils.</li>
            <li>It changes it from dry and brittle, to more soft and smooth like silk.</li>
            <li>it left my hair really soft and easy to detangle but because of the aloe vera in it, you have to watch your dew levels to avoid a huge poofy look to your hair.</li>
            <li>This conditioner made my hair clean, soft, and moisturized.  </li>
            <li>After a week, my scalp is still clean and my hair is soft and not fly-away.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair was left so soft and nice, yet, I was at ease using it.  </li>
            <li>I only buy organic or natural products for my skin and hair and I dabble in making my own at home.</li>
            <li>I used this conditioner for the past 2 weeks and my hair is consistently soft shiny and beautiful.</li>
            <li>I recently purchased this conditoner and felt it wouldn&#x27;t be fair to post a review without actually trying it for a period of time.  </li>
            <li>Not only does this smell nice but it leaves your hair silky soft.</li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s made my hair a lot more manageable and soft.  </li>
            <li>I currently use Lush shampoo bars which are also nice</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who wants their hair to look and feel healthy.</li>
            <li>once i used the conditioner it left my hair so nice and soft and</li>
            <li>This did leave my color treated hair soft and I love that it is all natural.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying for the longest time to find an effective natural sulfate-free conditioner that actually conditions my hair without leaving it greasy or feeling hay like.</li>
            <li>only gripe is that the product is a bit pricey, but I am loving it so far</li>
            <li>This conditioner has made my hair unbelievably soft, and now I even find that after I shower, my hair has that hair commercial-like shininess to it (which I honestly thought only straight-haired women got).</li>
            <li>I honestly woke up with my hair so soft that I wanted to see if it comes in bigger sizes.  </li>
            <li>It seems to me that Silk18 brightened my natural, kind of dishwater-ey blonde and also removed some of the the brassiness elsewhere</li>
            <li>With continued use I&#x27;m sure this is going to clear it up completely.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad to have finally found something that really works.</li>
            <li>This natural conditioner is my favorite so far.</li>
            <li>This is gentle and smells great and the only thing I trust on her sweet little head.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;m trying this product, hope it;s as good as the other reviews I have read so far</li>
            <li>At first I thought the vanilla scent smelled fake, but the more I use it, the more I really enjoy the smell.  </li>
            <li>Her hair is oily and mine is dry and the shampoo barely needs a conditioner even for me, and both leave our hair clean, smooth, shiny, comfortable.</li>
            <li>My hair simply did not feel CLEAN!</li>
            <li>Makes my hair super shiny and soft!  </li>
            <li>It is nice and light which isn&#x27;t enough for my very dry hair sometimes.</li>
            <li>I loved this conditioner because you only need a little to detangle and smooth out your hair.</li>
            <li>so it gets really dry especially after coloring it but this conditioner is amazing!</li>
            <li>I liked how it made my hair feel, but having a quick reaction usually means something is in this that may not be pointed out.</li>
            <li>First, the slight vanilla scent is really nice and soothing.</li>
            <li>I was fooled by all the positive ratings.</li>
            <li>, I read the reviews and they were all positive</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand the positive reviews because I read those before I purchased this and those people either have no hair</li>
            <li>I read all the positive reviews and decided to try this conditioner on the strength of those reviews.</li>
            <li>The card that asks for a review requests for the buyer to leave a review, it does not say leave a positive review.</li>
            <li>I came across this conditioner on Amazon and decided to give it a try with all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>I was concerned if all the positive reviews were legit....</li>
            <li>and I found the smell and the texture of people&#x27;s hair seemed to come up a lot in positive remarks.</li>
            <li>I tried this conditioner based on the positive reviews it had gotten on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>After reading positive reviews of the product I wanted to give it a try myself.</li>
            <li>I was super excited because I have low porosity 4c hair and the amino acids really help with moisture retention and manageability.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended, especially to the ladies with fine hair!</li>
            <li>I have long hair and have been getting compliments on how healthy my hair looks after using this conditioner.</li>
            <li>In the long run it is better to get this item and try it.</li>
            <li>I am so happy with this purchased that I feel tempted to get rid of all my other conditioners because I feel like this is the only one I need.</li>
            <li>And my hair feels clean, no residue, no slightly greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ve tried argan oil, conditioning treatments, overnight creams, curl cream, mousse, keratin, coconut oil, and pretty much</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty picky about my hair products, so this stuff is really knocking it out of the ballpark for me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It leaves my hair feeling really silky and smooth, much nicer than any natural conditioner I&#x27;ve tried before.</li>
            <li>BUT, I deal with it because it makes my long hair feel healthy.</li>
            <li>When i first used the conditioner i didn&#x27;t use much and as i was applying the conditioner was not spreading to all of my hair</li>
            <li>After dying my hair for the first time, so much of it fell out.</li>
            <li>I love that it also helps untangle my long, wavy hair.</li>
            <li>- I have about 22-24 inches of hair in long layers and slightly more</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s because they are more powerful than the other stuff that can be found on the market.</li>
            <li>The smell is pretty reasonable for a conditioner not overly powering which is why I bought it.</li>
            <li>love it and will stay with this brand for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Wish</li>
            <li>I stumbled on Maple Holistics while doing some online Christmas shopping last year, and decided that it was worth a shot to splurge on a more natural product, even if it wasn&#x27;t specifically a curly-hair</li>
            <li>After searching for random things on Amazon, I came across this Silk 18 Natural Conditioner &amp; saw so many great reviews, I decided to give it a shot.  </li>
            <li>, I have really dry/fried/frizzy/damaged hair and this has helped so much!</li>
            <li>I have tried so many conditioners and although they may have temporarily conditioned my hair, in the long run they were doing nothing for my hair.  </li>
            <li>I feel good about using a natural product and a natural product that actually works well</li>
            <li>I have fairly wavy hair that usually gets a bit frizzy.</li>
            <li>Her hair looks clean, soft, shiny and her scalp feels great and still makes her long thick hair easy to brush with no weigh-down.</li>
            <li>If possible it might be good to also have a bigger size with a pump also at a reasonable price (around $20).</li>
            <li>/&gt;Consistency of this product is also good , so you need to use small amount and you are done.</li>
            <li>Also, my top layer of hair always seemed to be moisturized but the bottom layer - especially at the nape of my neck - remained slightly brittle and would tangle very easily.   </li>
            <li>18 Natural Conditioner seems to be keeping my hair more and more manageable , less frizzy, and softer !</li>
            <li>Smell is amazing, and it conditions my hair without weighing it down.</li>
            <li>This conditioner leaves everyones hair in my family looking amazing without weighing it down.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing and conditions my hair without weighing it down.</li>
            <li>This conditioner is on par with the Perfect 10 brand for less than half the price.  </li>
            <li>It creates a nice slip and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down or make it feel greasy.  </li>
            <li>Then I can let my hair air dry wavy, or I can blowdry it straight, and it looks smooth, shiny, full, and doesn&#x27;t frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have dry, frizzy curly hair and this made it smell nice and feel soft after the first wash.</li>
            <li>I have been trying many natural conditioner choices lately and thought this one might be it since it had such great ratings.</li>
            <li>I have tried and used so many different shampoos and conditioners but this one is one of the best using natural ingredients and not as expensive as Wen.  </li>
            <li>My hair is naturally very fine &amp; easily tangled, especially when wet.</li>
            <li>I use this on all of my little girls and we all love it!</li>
            <li>next couple days while I wait for my full bottle!  </li>
            <li>My scalp is not itchy and does not dry out as fast; I live in the desert and it sure leaves a strain on my hair.</li>
            <li>For instance I love clean smells such as the combination of citrus and white pepper.</li>
            <li>I have been dealing with flaky dandruff dry scalp to top it off...</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised that this conditioner worked so well on my super tangled hair.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s coarse and tends to frizz easily.</li>
            <li>I have very fragile hair that breaks easily.  </li>
            <li>I actually use this as a deep conditioner and again am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>your hair is dry, you&#x27;ll probably love this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very particular about what products I use on my hair</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel super soft and silky.</li>
            <li>ends are still a bit dry after although most of my hair texture comes out softer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I ordered this because I have really dry hair and wanted more moisture and shine.  </li>
            <li>another note, for those individuals with super sensitive skin, this is the product to use...</li>
            <li>I have curly, highlighted hair and after switching from drugstore shampoo and conditioner to this and their Hydrate shampoo for dry hair, my hair has never looked better.</li>
            <li>It is not moisturizing enough for normal and healthy hairs.</li>
            <li>I have short wavy hair and it has a tendency of getting frizzy very quickly as soon as I leave the house.</li>
            <li>My hair became more brittle and dry.</li>
            <li>I could not believe how it left my hair silky and easy to comb through.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have normal hair and leaves my hair feeling and looking soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I have extremely dry hair and love this conditioner.</li>
            <li>All of the &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; conditioners I have tried make my hair even more dry and brittle, but they do stop my hair from falling out (so that must have been a chemical problem)</li>
            <li>Hair feels super soft and silky.</li>
            <li>also have super sensitive skin...</li>
            <li>my hair super soft, manageable and</li>
            <li>Makes my hair super shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so strong that it took hours and multiple washings for the smell to leave my hands.  </li>
            <li>I have yet to find a conditioner that helps my thin, fine hair be more full.</li>
            <li>5 days later I received a complimentary full sized bottle of this conditioner as promised..</li>
            <li>But regardless of the what scent it has, it is just too strong enough to give me a headache.  </li>
            <li>I do not use fragrance(s) and prefer my hair not have such a strong sustained fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Wonderful product, I have long thick hair</li>
            <li>Once dry, my hair felt great very soft and shiny, I even had an extra oomph of volume.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t contain any harsh ingredients, it smells wonderful and leaves my hair super soft without weighing it down or making it feel sticky.</li>
            <li>Finally found one that works great with detangling and does not weight our hair down.  </li>
            <li>It has certainly lived up to her expectations and mine.</li>
            <li>When I wash my hair, I let the conditioner soak in as directed and rinsing it out is like feeling pure silk in your hair.</li>
            <li>The large in the cocoons are boiled to death so that the cocoon bodies unravel to produce the silk.</li>
            <li>I certainly recommend that you buy this and see for yourself.</li>
            <li>I have very fine and thin hair; most often my hair felt blah.  </li>
            <li>The thing I like most is how easily it rinses out... far quicker than other products in this price range, which is high.</li>
            <li>Great silky feel and allows me to wet brush through my long hair!</li>
            <li>I have pretty thick wavy hair, and this does a great job at keeping it soft, and not too frizzy.</li>
            <li>After a few more uses, I am even happier with this product!  </li>
            <li>Now that I have used this conditioner a few times, I must say I love it!  </li>
            <li>I was searching for a cheap nAtural conditioner to get my frizzy hair under control now that I live in Hawaii.</li>
            <li>: Added a couple more pictures (fourth and fifth) after trying a new hair styling routine.</li>
            <li>: Added a couple more pictures (fourth and fifth) after trying a new hair styling routine.</li>
            <li>I live in Canada and we are Snowbirds, and you can be sure that I will bring a supply back home with me.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a good conditioner to go along with my new organic shampoo that I purchased a few weeks ago.  </li>
            <li>This conditioner makes my hair feel silky, look shiny, and allows me to comb through my thick, wavy hair much more easily without needing to use a leave-in conditioner.</li>
            <li>This product is the best remedy for my dry, frizzy, thick, curly, color treated hair.</li>
            <li>really this product leaves your hair super soft.</li>
            <li>It is very creamy and leaves my hair super shiny and soft.  </li>
            <li>Now, after 2 washes, my hair feels as soft as my 7 year olds, and get this--I don&#x27;t even have to blow it dry for it to look nice.</li>
            <li>Texture is very silky and easy to apply, don&#x27;t need to use a ton; which, with my hair being coarse and curly, I tend to blow through conditioner rapidly.</li>
            <li>My hair became very dull and I experienced some hair breakage after having my hair hi-lited.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so sold on this whole line because they use natural ingredients, as well as they make my hair amazingly soft, tangle free and so much healthier!</li>
            <li>I read a review that mentioned that Maple Holistics was offering a free product if you left a positive review.</li>
            <li>-- mine is short, gray, and somewhat fine.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m back to no hair loss in the shower or throughout the day) and works fine too.</li>
            <li>I really love that it made my coarse hair soft!</li>
            <li>I not only generally love this product but also I adore the fact that it&#x27;s made from natural ingredients and not tested on animals!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product several times now, and it seems like an affordable product for curly hair, plus it offers really great moisture for anybody with dry hair.</li>
            <li>After reading the reviews, I decided to try Silk 18 and one other brand and from the first time I used it, I was in LOVE.  </li>
            <li>I have used one bottle of Silk 18 and have ordered another, primarily because I like that it is comprised of more of the natural ingredients than the typical hair product.</li>
            <li>I am pretty particular about conditioners</li>
            <li>It is much softer and I just let it air dry and work some coconut serum through it to get rid of the last bit of frizzies and it is good to go.  </li>
            <li>(Note: I had been using a very high end conditioner &amp; matching shampoo by a company that makes professional/salon haircolor).</li>
            <li>have unruly hair that is very high maintenance;&lt;br /&gt;Silk</li>
            <li>It has a deep warm vanilla smell and leaves my hair feeling very soft and natural.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very humid where I live right now</li>
            <li>It is a great conditioner, but a little heavy for my fine, curly hair.  </li>
            <li>this i have to pour out a large amount since it doesn&#x27;t have as much slickness, and i feel like i pull my hair out when i brush it through with my fingers..</li>
            <li>Its a little pricey for the size, but I&#x27;m telling you, its amazing stuff.  </li>
            <li>I have fine, thick, frizzy hair, and the frizz is so much better when I use this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I used the Hydrate Shampoo first and left it on my hair and scalp for 3 minutes as recommended, and then rinsed it clean.  </li>
            <li>It does the job without weighing my already fine, straight hair totally lifeless.</li>
            <li>I fill it right in my scalp-it alive now!</li>
            <li>Anyway, I used this conditioner with high hopes considering the name (Silk 18) and stellar reviews.</li>
            <li>I have always had to use more expensive brands of shampoos and conditioners and we have tried more brands and spent more money than I care to recall over the years!</li>
            <li>I started  using the Argan Shampoo and Silk Conditioner, the first time I used my hair been so easy to deal with, strong,  thick, and so shine</li>
            <li>And I think it actually makes my fine, thin hair look somewhat fuller, which is great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s hard to find a good conditioning</li>
            <li>My hair isn&#x27;t as frizzy or dry anymore due to the great ingredients that are in the product.</li>
            <li>their website will send you a free sample to try first, I only buy high end hair products</li>
            <li>Using only a little bit, and despite being sulfate free it suds up nicely and gets my hair very clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>I agree with the many other positive reviews.</li>
            <li>I have been using this conditioner for a few years now and it is absolutely amazing.  </li>
            <li>so even though I know it still looks very poofy to some, just know that this is seriously such a huge improvement for me.</li>
            <li>so even though I know it still looks very poofy to some, just know that this is seriously such a huge improvement for me.</li>
            <li>Third, I really like that it&#x27;s sulfate free.</li>
            <li>and I have instantly noticed a huge difference.</li>
            <li>The last time I visited my hair stylist for a cut &amp; color, I had only just ordered Silk 18 and used the conditioner one time, and my stylist could not stop freaking out at how shiny and amazing my hair looked.  </li>
            <li>However,  I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I straightened my hair and my hair looked so much softer and thinner than ever because there is no chemicals or sulfates in it</li>
            <li>This Maple Holistics product works really well</li>
            <li>This treatment reminds of conditioners I have purchased at the salon that cost twice as much.</li>
            <li>I really like them both.</li>
            <li>I really like the almond scent</li>
            <li>Within 3 uses, my hair became so much smoother.</li>
            <li>It really made my hair stop falling out as much (</li>
            <li>That said, my scalp gets really itchy and I was hoping this would cure it.</li>
            <li>I really like this conditioner.</li>
            <li>I can really see the difference in my hair and scalp.</li>
            <li>It really isn&#x27;t an issue</li>
            <li>I really like all of the maple holistics products that I have purchased.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my hair very hydrated</li>
            <li>My hair has a natural wave to it in the back and underneath and is straight in the front and on top.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very picky about my conditioner.</li>
            <li>i purchased this product based on the reviews and it really does what it claims.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t believe this is actually sulfate free.</li>
            <li>I leave it in while I wash to really let it soak into my ends.</li>
            <li>My hair is no longer frizzy, it&#x27;s much stronger and does not break off anymore.  </li>
            <li>It is very concentrated, so</li>
            <li>and I wanted a heavier finish, but now that it&#x27;s a bit longer not so much.</li>
            <li>But I really like it.</li>
            <li>And it moisturized very well, didn&#x27;t leave build up and untangled my hair.</li>
            <li>Using a bit more than a pea size amount left my hair soft and my scalp really relaxed.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>I really like this conditioner.</li>
            <li>and I really like that.</li>
            <li>My hair is very curly and tends towards dryness.</li>
            <li>but I really like it.  </li>
            <li>Minus one star because the scent is not my favorite</li>
            <li>but I really like this one.</li>
            <li>Even using the diffuser didn&#x27;t really help at all.</li>
            <li>You will not immediately be able to run your hands through your hair, and it will not feel silky while it&#x27;s wet.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this conditioner after all the rave reviews</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t leave my hair as smooth as a regular product (like Pantene for example).</li>
            <li>I could run my fingers through my hair and really get it worked in.</li>
            <li>Left my hair smooth and silk.</li>
            <li>This conditioner leaves my hair silky smooth, definitely will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m at 3 weeks now and my hair is much improved.  </li>
            <li>Very impress</li>
            <li>I tried so many products throughout my life but my prayers were unanswered as Curly hair doesn&#x27;t suit me .</li>
            <li>somehow when i apply this conditioner, i feel too much of hair fall during wash...</li>
            <li>it has a real swing to it now...and people have remarked on it.  </li>
            <li>My hair is very damaged.  </li>
            <li>I find I don&#x27;t need to use as much argan oil-based leave in conditioner as I did before.</li>
            <li>After about a week of using it my hair looked so much healthier.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>My hair is very course and a bit damaged though, so it may work for you if your hair isn&#x27;t damaged at all.</li>
            <li>, I recommend this products  to every one, it work for all  hair, Thank you so much  Maple Holistic,</li>
            <li>Definitely silky smooth</li>
            <li>I have a ton of hair so this is going to go fast.</li>
            <li>I really  like the smell.</li>
            <li>I dye my hair light blonde</li>
            <li>its used to much lather in shampoos and conditioners..</li>
            <li>I feel like leaving in the conditioner to sit in my hair works really well</li>
            <li>I have very acne prone skin</li>
            <li>Also the price is so reasonable for the quality.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my daughters&#x27; very curly hair.</li>
            <li>They both really like it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>It really softens crunchy hair.</li>
            <li>so it wouldn&#x27;t get washed out before I was ready.</li>
            <li>None of them really worked well.  </li>
            <li>shampoo conditioner that I really like.  </li>
            <li>so this conditioner may do better on coarser hair or even no straight</li>
            <li>When I use these hair products I really feel like I am doing my hair a favor.</li>
            <li>I really do. :</li>
            <li>Really helps detangle my hair.  </li>
            <li>I am very picky with my conditioner.</li>
            <li>I really couldn&#x27;t believe it.  </li>
            <li>I was initially very scared of using anything homeopathic.</li>
            <li>really recommended</li>
            <li>I really this conditioner, even though it leaked all over the packaging.</li>
            <li>It feels so much softer when I run my fingers through it</li>
            <li>Also, the curls stay very well defined.</li>
            <li>I really like this conditioner.  </li>
            <li>so I have tried serums to control frizz, but I ended up with unusual side effect...</li>
            <li>but it is very lightweight</li>
            <li>The scent is gentle and not overpowering.</li>
            <li>I realized then how much this conditioner has been helping me.</li>
            <li>Better than expected - if it continues to work I will give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li>/nasty like the grocery store conditioner I had been using (for about 10 min after applying the cheap conditioner, my hands would always feel so gross even after washing)</li>
            <li>My hair was breaking off a lot and after using this product I can really tell a difference.</li>
            <li>and I really like it, though it does pull out a lot of color from my hair --</li>
            <li>I have gray hair and this leaves it very silver.</li>
            <li>However, Maple Holistics contacted me to see If I was satisfied with this product, When I told them not really</li>
            <li>The tangles come out much easier.</li>
            <li>really it works.....</li>
            <li>This product really makes a difference in my hair.</li>
            <li>Very unmanageable.  </li>
            <li>but it left my hair feeling wonderful/soft and light after one use.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this shampoo along with the Silk 18 conditioner about a month ago, and I can really see and feel a difference in my hair.  </li>
            <li>I started washing with a Maple Holistics shampoo for dandruff/dry scalp, condition with this for 5-15 minutes depending on how much time I have, follow it up with a detangling spray (</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Nexus Color Assure sulfate-free shampoo for about a month, which I really like, but adding this conditioner has made a noticeable difference.  </li>
            <li>My hair absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li>I never thought I would ever find a product that actually, really worked!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I tried to use it sparingly because I didnt want to go through it so fast.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I really like this conditioner.</li>
            <li>I use Maple Holistics shampoo which I really like as it makes my hair feel  so much thicker</li>
            <li>After much research, i stumbled upon this product on amazon.</li>
            <li>I really like this conditioner a lot.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t need to use too much.</li>
            <li>The conditioner works very well.</li>
            <li>It is vanilla-scented and very soothing.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really give me any noticeable results.</li>
            <li>Added some moisture but not as much as i had desired.</li>
            <li>I found this product to be very oily, so much so that my hair looks and feels oily for two days after using it.  </li>
            <li>and I really believe it earned it&#x27;s name &amp;#34;silk!&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>Overall, a great conditioner that I would recommend to anyone looking for a healthy alternative and anyone with damaged, thin hair like mine!</li>
            <li>I also really like the way it smells.</li>
            <li>so conditioning is an absolute must</li>
            <li>&amp;#34; Whether is it vegetarian and ethically raised, ask the the company where they get their silk protein.</li>
            <li>but I guess that is the whole point of Silk 18.</li>
            <li>This in combination with the Sage Shampoo has really helped me.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t do much for my hair</li>
            <li>My hair feels much smoother.  </li>
            <li>It did NOTHING for tangled hair and didn&#x27;t really help with frizz either...</li>
            <li>This is absolutely miraculous.</li>
            <li>I actually really like it.</li>
            <li>This conditioner makes my hair very shiny and silky.  </li>
            <li>and this allows me to comb it straight out of the shower.......</li>
            <li>I am using it in the shower each time I wash my hair, and really like the application-</li>
            <li>I am a real jerk to my hair</li>
            <li>So I really needed a product that can help my hair keep its moisture.</li>
            <li>I really like the smell too.</li>
            <li>Much to my surprise, after using this conditioner twice, it transformed my hair from straw to silk.</li>
            <li>Price point is a bit of a challenge for the size but worth it for the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>It also really nourishes--not just coats the hair.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even know if that&#x27;s legal??</li>
            <li>I really hope I get to try it.</li>
            <li>Really wanted to like this product after reading all the reviews.</li>
            <li>My hair is soo much thicker after using this.</li>
            <li>This conditioner makes that much easier to do.</li>
            <li>Very smoky vanilla type smell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this conditioner for a couple of months now and really like it.</li>
            <li>Aside from that, I really like this conditioner.</li>
            <li>I have extensions in (real hair, tape in-</li>
            <li>Really like this stuff</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been battling my whole life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>--I used to simply pick any shampoo that &amp;#34;looked good,&amp;#34; was priced cheap and used it until finished with the bottle.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t need to use nearly as much conditioner to untangle my hair with this product.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll really like it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve already had to cut too much off and was looking for something to salvage the rest until it can grow out.</li>
            <li>Also the rep was very knowledgeable</li>
            <li>I really like the product.</li>
            <li>Delivered on time but product made my hair very tangly.</li>
            <li>it really put the moisture in my hair.</li>
            <li>I really want to try their shampoo with tea tree and see if that helps my thinning and hair breaking off.</li>
            <li>It really works well on my color treated and curly hair.  </li>
            <li>, really.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to others!  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to all!</li>
            <li>It really depends on your hair type.</li>
            <li>Has a lot more chemical ingredients than I expected, but I tried it out.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t very concentrated.</li>
            <li>I use it on my 8 yr olds very curly hair</li>
            <li>I was very disapointed with the results.</li>
            <li>After using this conditioner once, I could feel my hair was much softer and hydrated.</li>
            <li>My hair is overly processed and this product has really helped repair it.  </li>
            <li>I have very curly hair</li>
            <li>Then I proceeded to use my straight iron to style my hair</li>
            <li>and I refuse to pay that much money for something I use every day and go through quickly.&lt;br /&gt;After reading reviews on this product I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>So I can&#x27;t brush it very often which was causing hideous tangles.</li>
            <li>makes brushing much easier since its so conditioned.  </li>
            <li>My hair feels very silky after use, and my biggest concern of having an allergic, itchy reaction did not come to pass.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s much healthier for my scalp and hair than what I&#x27;d been using before.</li>
            <li>This smells absolutely divine.</li>
            <li>I give it four stars because I think the price is a bit much for the size of the bottle.</li>
            <li>I really, really did.</li>
            <li>wish I could tell you that I absolutely adored the product and will be purchasing it again.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I really like using this conditioner.</li>
            <li>It really moisturizes my hair, but it also rinses out very well.</li>
            <li>Haha.</li>
            <li>The amino acids &amp; silk proteins really get to work on your hair and you can tell the difference immediately.</li>
            <li>but it really doesn&#x27;t bother me.  </li>
            <li>This product, while probably works, can&#x27;t really be used.  </li>
            <li>In reality removing a smell by dominating it with something else really just enhances both.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely noticed a difference in the vibrancy and resiliency of my hair after just one use.</li>
            <li>Left my hair so silky and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I use this along with the Tea Tree lice treatment shampoo you have and will not buy another conditioner unless I absolutely have to.  </li>
            <li>In fact, I really like it.</li>
            <li>I really like the fragrance</li>
            <li>MY HAIR IS REALLY</li>
            <li>but I would much rather a herbal or flowery smell.</li>
            <li>I already have thinning hair (thanks to thyroid and hormone issues)</li>
            <li>The combination really helps my scalp.</li>
            <li>Also,  I did not find this conditioner very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>;  I&#x27;m real.  </li>
            <li>I really like the conditioner.</li>
            <li>make my hair soooo much softer.</li>
            <li>I really wanted this product to work.</li>
            <li>It makes brushing my daughters hair much easier.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After I used the cleansing scalp shampoo, my hair was VERY stripped and brittle and after I put the Silk 18 on, it almost immediately softened and detangled.</li>
            <li>I believe this would really help ty</li>
            <li>Silk 18 is gentle and conditions thoroughly without leaving any build-up.</li>
            <li>, you really have no idea</li>
            <li>So much so that my bathroom looks like the hair care isle in a store.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and plan to buy it again!</li>
            <li>I like the shampoo so much</li>
            <li>The conditioner worked really well on my hair.</li>
            <li>However I really didn&#x27;t like the scent...</li>
            <li>I have paid so much money for hair products and now I ask myself why?</li>
            <li>It really helped his flakes.  </li>
            <li>Like real vanilla, not like cake.  </li>
            <li>My only negative is it kind of burned my eyes more then</li>
            <li>I like it so much</li>
            <li>I have hair below my chest and it really gets all of it and well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really silk in a bottle.  </li>
            <li>, my hair feels so much softer.</li>
            <li>I recently switched to sulfate free shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>The customers reviews really helped me a lot.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair very tangly.</li>
            <li>I really like this conditioner.  </li>
            <li>so it really makes up for the cost</li>
            <li>Ooooo, the vanilla smell is absolutely DEVINE</li>
            <li>so i don&#x27;t focus to much on taking care of my hair</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>But I really do like the way it leaves your hair feeling.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Almost totally dandruff free already&amp;#34;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This conditioner leaves my hair with so much bounce and body.</li>
            <li>I  apply this product as a leave-in conditioner on wet hair mostly.  </li>
            <li>It has never had so much volume.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have really frizzy hair, and I was looking for a product to help me deal with it.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t had much dandruff since I started using it.</li>
            <li>I would suggest trying to get a sample of this product to test on your hair before purchasing a whole bottle.</li>
            <li>and it still goes fast.</li>
            <li>It allows for you dangle so much easier.</li>
            <li>Really like this product, it seems to condition my split ends.</li>
            <li>haha.  </li>
            <li>You really should try this product.</li>
            <li>Works really well too.</li>
            <li>I really like the feel of my hair with this conditioner.  </li>
            <li>The shine is very noticeable.</li>
            <li>My husband notices it and really loves it</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s enough to keep my hair smooth.</li>
            <li>I have very frizzy damaged hair</li>
            <li>I actually really like this stuff and would buy again</li>
            <li>and  adds much needed shine.</li>
            <li>It really does give hair a silkiness.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make your hair straight or anything.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to use much to style my hair with these products.</li>
            <li>This works very well.  </li>
            <li>My hair was like straw before and after one use it feel much softer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shipping was fast, and I appreciate the company emailing me to see if I like their product.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>I was worried this would be too much moisture for me but its not at all.  </li>
            <li>I believe it has worked well with a vitamin shampoo to really strengthen my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>conditioner partners very well with &amp;#34;VITAMINS Hair Loss Shampoo&amp;#34</li>
            <li>Leaves hair soft &amp; tangle free,  but not heavy weighted like some products.</li>
            <li>though I kind of want a giant bottle of it just so it&#x27;ll last me a bit longer.</li>
            <li>the last several bottles I&#x27;ve purchased smell kind of funky.</li>
            <li>I really liked this conditioner only because of how organic it felt and how it left my hair and scalp after use.</li>
            <li>My hair doesn&#x27;t seem to accept moisture well regardless of what I use on it, but this at least gave it good slip and detangled well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I did some research and found that when people have low elasticity in their hair they either do better with a natural oil like coconut oil or with protein.</li>
            <li>Since I became more conscientious about products I used in my daily life, I went on a quest for a natural shampoo and air conditioner.</li>
            <li>This conditioner, in a brief amount of time, has made my hair look and feel soft, shiny and healthy.  </li>
            <li>my hair has recovered nicely from using this product for such a short period of time.  </li>
            <li>This conditioner not only seal my ends on my hair, but it uses natural ingredients to make it smooth!</li>
            <li>My hair felt really nice, but it didn&#x27;t make it feel any nicer than when I leave it on in the shower for a few minutes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a cosmetologist and the list of products I have tried is endless, but this is by far my favorite!</li>
            <li>My ends are looking better, too, but I think only a trim can make them as soft as I would like.</li>
            <li>I have tried nearly every conditioner on the market ranging from top of the line to generic brands.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ve actually got a nice even tone without having to run back to the hairdresser!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have air dried and blow dried my hair and it leaves my hair just wonderful.</li>
            <li>it seems more trouble then it&#x27;s worth, &amp;#34;It&#x27;s just conditioner guys, just finish it</li>
            <li>Nice conditioner, not too heavy.</li>
            <li>But sometimes 2 out of 5 times i felt the hair is soft but when i run my fingers through my hair it was kind of rough.</li>
            <li>old, almost sure it&#x27;ll have the same effect.  </li>
            <li>The smell is good, but not amazing:</li>
            <li>So if u are looking for s good natural conditioner without harsh chemicals</li>
            <li>conditioner works surprisingly well on my thick, frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li>No more dry scalp, soft beautiful hair!!!</li>
            <li>I am an older woman and color my hair which has always been fine, but thick and now thinning on top.</li>
            <li>It left my hair dry and full of static.</li>
            <li>I have long, highlighted hair and this conditioner is my new favorite.</li>
            <li>WOW!!!</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t believe how soft and shiny it made my hair without oil build up!!!  </li>
            <li>The softness and tangle-free state that it left my hair is nothing less than amazing!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been battling my dry curly hair for decades and this is the first product I&#x27;ve found that genuinely makes a difference</li>
            <li>After using this for the very first time, I noticed a major difference in my hair texture.</li>
            <li>I could tell a difference right away, keeping my hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>For reference purposes, I have think, long, curly, easily frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>Inotherwords, it doesn&#x27;t turn my hair from blonde to brown like other products I&#x27;ve tried and does a good job of conditioning.</li>
            <li>The vanilla scent is a bit strong but does not linger long.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also been known to wake up after a long night with some pretty significant &#x27;bed head&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>This conditioner makes my hair very soft and doesn&#x27;t seem dry any more.  </li>
            <li>I have been searching endlessly for an alcohol-free conditioner, safe for color and that will also help nourish my brittle and frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>I have tried many other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; brands of shampoo and conditioner with unsatisfactory results.  </li>
            <li>and I can still smell a bit of the scent hours after shampooing - with most other shampoos/conditioners, my hair just smells like hair.  </li>
            <li>We received this last week and we already see a significant improvement in her dandruff.  </li>
            <li>I am also eager to try out the shampoo products from this company now that I&#x27;ve seen what the conditioner can do; I hope there are other conditioning treatments available in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for reading about my experience, and I hope this works out as well for you as it did for me!</li>
            <li>I am also eager to try out the shampoo products from this company now that I&#x27;ve seen what the conditioner can do; I hope there are other conditioning treatments available in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for reading about my experience, and I hope this works out as well for you as it did for me!</li>
            <li>I love it and would recommend other</li>
            <li>I’ve been raving on and on about how great it smells and how a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>But, I wanted to make sure since my first purchase of this product, over a year later, I received same product for review purpose again.</li>
            <li>I do mostly co-wash for my hair and this works extremely well.</li>
            <li>I am excited to try their tea tree shampoo next and see if it can fix my scalp problem!</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m excited to see my results after I finish the entire bottle.</li>
            <li>I love how the scent seems to linger longer than other conditions.</li>
            <li>I have dropped it more than any other bottle in my shower.</li>
            <li>/&gt;long way; with other conditioners I would have to use a lot more to get any&lt;br /&gt;result.</li>
            <li>I have very long hair, and it is not always easy to take care of.  </li>
            <li>I have had my wavy caucasian hair in dreads, which were combed out a year or so ago, then white-blonde bleached and now dyed bright purple, so my hair has seriously seen some things.  </li>
            <li>As I have gotten older and damaged my hair I have not recieved much in the way of compliments.</li>
            <li>I am African American,  I did the big chop and only used natural products on my hair and this product works perfect on my hair..</li>
            <li>I have long fine hair, and this conditioner did nothing for me.</li>
            <li>The first time I used this product, I wanted to run to the computer and post a glowing review, but I decided to try it a few more days, just in case.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair, and I like to wear it long and curled.</li>
            <li>The smell is great and I only need a small amount.</li>
            <li>I have long, fine hair</li>
            <li>Not only does it fell clean</li>
            <li>It has helped my long gray, frizzy hair that is also fine.</li>
            <li>I have long fine color treated hair with lots of flyaways:</li>
            <li>It is incredibly moisturizing on my long, thick, overly processed hair.</li>
            <li>Very light weight, doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li>This was very light and didn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li>After just 2 days of using this conditioner, my hair looks silky and feels very smooth and does not weigh down with residue or leave flakes on my scalp.</li>
            <li>I have very light hair and was concerned this could weight it down or leave it oily</li>
            <li>The company offers a free product on your next order if you leave a positive review.</li>
            <li>A lot of the products for curls just end up weighing down the hair on top of my head, so that it is straight while the sides are curly.  </li>
            <li>;) I normally awaken to a tangled, frizzy mess that looks as if it has more purpose in a birds nest than on my head.</li>
            <li>Silk 18 was the perfect solution for my very thick hair that loves to both frizz and dry out.</li>
            <li>It has a very nice vanilla scent to it and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I also very much appreciate your natural approach.</li>
            <li>I really like the scent and the product and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I have thin, fine, straight hair and most conditioners</li>
            <li>I recently purchased this for myself because I was tired of buying Pantene conditioner or other brands at Rite Aid, and thought I would try this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simply: The BEST conditioner I have ever used and more natural.</li>
            <li>I love the shampoo of this type and decided to try the conditioner too, but find it&#x27;s a bit much for my fine thin hair.  </li>
            <li>Just a little bit leaves my hair soft and smooth, and the scent is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly, course, dry hair that has been lightened...leading to more dryness.  </li>
            <li>It left my hair really soft and easy to brush afterwards.</li>
            <li>It made it super soft, soft as silk.</li>
            <li>I have long, fine hair and most conditioners weigh my hair down</li>
            <li>Was expecting to make my hair silky and soft but it made it more tangled and dry.</li>
            <li>It smells mild and that&#x27;s perfect (no &amp;#34;tropical coconut&amp;#34; crap).</li>
            <li>But I googled most of them and every single one were basically natural.</li>
            <li>I have stocked up on it, as long as I can find it as cheap.</li>
            <li>the smell is fine, vanilla ,not my favorite but not strong at all only could smell it in shower not after my hair was done.  </li>
            <li>My first time trying this product I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>The smell is so nice, but not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>I have to shampoo pretty frequently because of my oily scalp.</li>
            <li>It was soft and managable after the first use.</li>
            <li>they were so nice and sent me a small sample bottle to try.  </li>
            <li>I immediately ordered the full size as well as one of their shampoos and it has made such a difference.  </li>
            <li>My 9 yr old has received many compliments about how soft her hair is since using it on a regular basis.  </li>
            <li>My hair after the first use was really soft feeling, even after blow drying it.  </li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed after using the Maple Holistics shampoo &amp; conditioner was that it made my hair really soft.  </li>
            <li>As expensive as natural and organic product is it is nice to be able to just use it when I am going somewhere that I would need to do something with my hair.</li>
            <li>The best of it is only last one day, and not like other chemical brands that smell can be last forever.</li>
            <li>my hair is so soft and shiny, and it helped with the frizziness with the first use.</li>
            <li>I dye my hair frequently and this conditioner really helps to bring it out of its straw-like state!</li>
            <li>It smells terrific and left my daughters hair very shiny, silky, and smooth!</li>
            <li>From the first use my hair was soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>my hair feels alive and had body for the first time.</li>
            <li>I have a pretty sensitive nose, but this scent doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li>Aloe Vera is the second ingredient, and it has botanical keratin, shea butter, pomegranate, hibiscus green tea, sea buckthorn, argan, jojoba, and most importantly, silk amino acids.</li>
            <li>I washed with my regular shampoo then applied Silk 18, put a palm full of water on my hair to help \\&quot;move\\&quot; the product throughout my hair, covering every strand.  </li>
            <li>He loved it and was surprised how it dried and looked like it has professional curls done.</li>
            <li>Let me preface by saying I have tried more conditioners than I can count on two hands (and feet!), both cheap grocery store brands and expensive beauty supply brands.</li>
            <li>naturally curly hair gets a lot of damage from highlights and I live in Florida right now..</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and many conditioners are just too heavy, causing my hair to appear flat and lifeless.  </li>
            <li>I have long, fine to normal hair, wavyish in texture.</li>
            <li>The smell is not nauseating to me, and it&#x27;s hands down a better (and cheaper) product than Wen.</li>
            <li>Hands down my favorite conditioner.</li>
            <li>But, because I don&#x27;t shampoo, if I use it too many times a week, it can start to weigh my hair down.  </li>
            <li>I would love to see the price go down a bit--maybe to the $9 mark--or</li>
            <li>the more it also weighs my hair down.</li>
            <li>I immediately noticed a positive difference but it has always been the hair conditioner that has left me still searching for the right one.  </li>
            <li>This is my new go-to conditioner!</li>
            <li>I cannot live without this!</li>
            <li>I found my new conditioner!</li>
            <li>My co-worker even asked me if I had a new product!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll make an exception for special events, but my general routine is to just wash and go (I&#x27;m a busy mom!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will update in the future if there is any significant difference in my hair after a few more months.</li>
            <li>This conditioner, is not only sulphate or any other chemical free, but also has amino acids and proteins that make my hair smooth.</li>
            <li>Silk 18 is great because it&#x27;s all natural and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling heavy and flat.</li>
            <li>I dont live in a tropical humid location, but still my hair tends to get frizzy, but has done very well with this conditioner.</li>
            <li>I live in Texas where it is very humid and this stuff fits the bill for me.</li>
            <li>I can also tell a huge difference in my itchy scalp, it is no longer dry.  </li>
            <li>Also my dry, flakey scalp has seen a huge improvement.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t shower every day nor use a bunch of products and would say that I&#x27;m on the less is more spectrum of life so this product fits the bill.</li>
            <li>and I disagree with previous reviewers that say the scent is overwhelming.</li>
            <li>In addition, using this combination of products is saving me so much more time because I&#x27;m washing my hair a lot less.</li>
            <li>so I love using it for that reason alone, but it also conditions so well and without having to use half the bottle.</li>
            <li>It has made my hair so much more manageable in terms of smoother and less tangled.</li>
            <li>I love the texture and slight vanilla smell of the Silk 18 conditioner and how silky it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li>After a month and a half I continue seeing improvement and feel much better.  </li>
            <li>I can immediately feel a difference when using it, and my hair has become much less oily and curls better.</li>
            <li>My hair was absolutely more silky/shiny and had less frizz.  </li>
            <li>I felt my hair was still dry and not silky or smooth at all.</li>
            <li>but then I could use less and use it more often.  </li>
            <li>I have always been sceptical about products that say they moisturize, mostly because I never found one that did even half the job it says it would.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely stay loyal to this conditioner .</li>
            <li>I am now using only organic or natural products and their products fit the bill.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s the main reason I started using these</li>
            <li>Secondly, it leaves my hair really soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I am definitely going to buy more of this in the future.</li>
            <li>I spent many days to find another natural hair products</li>
            <li>The shape of the curls themselves aren&#x27;t very consistent at all, and the silhouette of the style is unusual (flat in some places, voluminous in others).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This literally transformed my hair after only one use, love this product and will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li>and I had used many different conditioners and detangling products on her hair prior to Silk 18.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m seriously never wasting my time on another conditioner again.</li>
            <li>I will seriously never use another conditioner again.</li>
            <li>and my hair is still the same, soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>The second time i applied much more and in layers buti still had the same problem just not as severe.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s decently moisturizing but not at all greasy.</li>
            <li>when I say it was exactly like after that first wash; strands simply ran from my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I recently got this as a present and really love the way it feels on my hair.</li>
            <li>Overall, I was most definitely 5-star</li>
            <li>It smells great and a small amount goes a long wait.  </li>
            <li>Leaves hair soft and shiny following your fantastic shampoo.</li>
            <li>I would not pay more than $10.77 for this size bottle of this product and wouldn&#x27;t even have looked at it if it was more expensive.</li>
            <li>We emailed back and forth several times as I had questions about which shampoo would most benefit my hair/scalp as I have itchy, flaky issues.  </li>
            <li>I made a career of it and got used to short hair and kept it short for many years.</li>
            <li>My main filter is the Pelican I purchased on Amazon and the Vitamin c shower head filter I purchased on anther online store, but they do sell them on Amazon.    </li>
            <li>People with a similar hair type I imagine would have similar results :).&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wish it came in a larger bottle as I will be purchasing more in the future.  </li>
            <li>This product tamed my super frizzy hair with a lasting vanilla scent.</li>
            <li>It is nice smelling, fairly thick, and really conditions well.</li>
            <li>and when I take out my twist my is back soft and tangle free.</li>
            <li>Has a very subtle vanilla smell to it and definitely the best conditioner i have used so far.</li>
            <li>Great product I&#x27;ve decided to go natural and stop putting unhealthy stuff in my hair so it can grow stronger and fuller</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a fan of vanilla scent so its particularly obnoxious to me.</li>
            <li>I am happy to recommend SILK 18 to anyone with similar conditions or just as a soothing after shampoo treatment for delicate hair.</li>
            <li>I have been searching for a natural conditioner that actually leaves my hair knot-free and silky smooth.  </li>
            <li>I just bought this item recently and I have to say it&#x27;s fabulous, leaves my hair feeling hydrated but not heavy</li>
            <li>(By the way, I&#x27;m about to purchase my fourth bottle, so the results do appear rather quickly.)  </li>
            <li>As I said before, I&#x27;ve only used it once, but already my hair feels soft to the touch, light, moisturized, not greasy AND</li>
            <li>The older</li>
            <li>However I didn&#x27;t particularly care for the smell.</li>
            <li>I like that its a decent price.</li>
            <li>If nothing else I would say to try these products worry free as they are true to their word and will refund your money if you are not satisfied.</li>
            <li>It detangled my fine hair and left it silky smooth without weighing it down.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this conditioner to any person that is looking for a change in their hair treatment or just looking for a new conditioner!</li>
            <li>very well - my hair is very soft</li>
            <li>My hair is very fine and curly, and I usually don&#x27;t have to do much to get the tangles out.</li>
            <li>Makes my fine and &amp;#34;too often straightened with a flat iron&amp;#34; hair seem soft.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that this is a natural conditioner so that and all the positive reviews are what made me purchase it along with the argan shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I have short hair (above my shoulders) and I have to use a lot more of this product than I normally do.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Have been using this product for a couple weeks now, and my hair is much shinier and soft and all around healthier!</li>
            <li>My hair never feels very soft until now!</li>
            <li>Love that the ingredient list is readable and not full of synthetics.</li>
            <li>Both my goals were accomplished and now my hair is silky soft and tamed!</li>
            <li>A friendly company goes a long way in my book.</li>
            <li>The scent is of vanilla and almonds, sweet but not overpowering, so you actually like how it leaves a soft and gentle aroma.</li>
            <li>Not only are the ingredients safe, but my hair is super soft and smooth after only a few weeks of using.</li>
            <li>My hair is silky smooth and my scalp isn&#x27;t dry and flaky like it normally is this time of year.</li>
            <li>I really think this stuff is just full of chemicals, it has to be to dry my hair out like that</li>
            <li>Wonderful scent, leaves hair as shiny and soft as my most expensive deep conditioning treatments ( e.g. Lush&#x27;s Fluff-ease) and doesn&#x27;t weigh down my long, straight fine hair at all.</li>
            <li>in all, I would wholeheartedly recommend this conditioner to anyone with wavy-curly hair, or just more generally, to anyone with dry hair.</li>
            <li>The smell is a pleasant vanilla and not overpowering and you only need to use a small amount of conditioner, as it is so concentrated.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Wish price wasn&#x27;t so high</li>

            <li>I HIGHLY recommend getting this</li>
            <li>By the way, If You have issues with dandruff, the Sage shampoo is another product I would highly recommend you try.</li>
            <li>After using Silk 18, I highly doubt I will try anything else.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>, I highly recommend you try this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone who deals with tangles.</li>
            <li>I have seen a huge improvement in my dry, brittle ends!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t expect any naturally based product to magically make me have movie star hair, but it has made it soooo much smoother and less tangled</li>
            <li>On the other hand, it really doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel silky smooth.  </li>
            <li>Smells better than other natural conditioners.</li>
            <li>I can finally find a product that is both natural and works effectively to seal my dry ends.</li>
            <li>This conditioner is a little better than other conditioners I have used because my hair is not limp, but I will continue searching for a better conditioner for my hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m used to paying a little more for high quality products and ingredients, so I understand it,</li>
            <li>It made my hair feel very soft and did a good job of detangling my thick, naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li>I might also add that certain products cause me to have rashes and redness, so I am switching to organic, 100% natural products.</li>
            <li>My hair is super soft , shiny, and full, without being weighed down .</li>
            <li>So far I like the smell even though it&#x27;s not something I&#x27;d usually pick, but after using it my hair is smooth and easy to comb through and soft the rest of the day.</li>
            <li>I have recently purchased this conditioner for the first time and have seen an immediate change in the manageability of my hair!  </li>
            <li>It left my hair feeling silky and shiny after the first use!  </li>
            <li>I just wish it gave my hair a little more body.  </li>
            <li>Makes my hair feel really soft!!</li>
            <li>I combine this with another conditioner that is a little heavier to keep my hair more manageable.</li>
            <li>I noticed a major difference even after the first use.  </li>
            <li>WOW!!</li>
            <li>I also tried their argan oil shampoo and it is equally amazing-leaves the hair clean, but soft.</li>
            <li>It left my hair feeling clean (no residue), soft, manageable, and silky as the name states.</li>
            <li>Often I&#x27;ve tried natural shampoos being careful to steer clear of all the chemicals in most shampoos/conditioners, and been less than satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li>I have a lot fine, long blond hair and my old shampoo was too drying.</li>
            <li>I live in a very dry climate and I have been looking for a conditioner that would help my fine hair to be moisturized but not too greasy.</li>
            <li>I have tried many chemical free hair products a lot more expensive, and nothing even compares!!  </li>
            <li>Before trying this amazing product my hair was dull and I decided to go homeopathic.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so so many things to get my fine, thin, highlighted hair to feel soft again</li>
            <li>but like some other reviews the fragrance is a bit strong on the vanilla side, but nothing that would make me Not buy the product.</li>
            <li>Other reviews remarked that it was too strong.  </li>
            <li>Kind of hard not getting on my scalp</li>
            <li>They left my hair feeling clean and smooth, without looking oily or weighed down.</li>
            <li>It has a creamy feel and texture like a &amp;#34;traditional conditioner&amp;#34;, detangles and smooths my fine hair well without weighing it down, makes my scalp and head feel and smell amazing (like Vanilla; it&#x27;s not overwhelming</li>
            <li>so I my hair isn&#x27;t going to look amazing (at least to me),</li>
            <li>and I know that not all professional products really work for ever hair type.</li>
            <li>I am sensitive to smells but the smell isn&#x27;t so overpowering to make you sneeze the whole time.</li>
            <li>My hair is much softer than before and it seems that the frequent loss of hair is coming to an end.</li>
            <li>She has thick course red hair and this conditioner has amazing results!  </li>
            <li>In addition to the way this product makes my hair feel, I also like the idea that the product is gentle, and uses natural and sometimes organic ingredients.  </li>
            <li>I really do not believe this is silicone free and &amp;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so sold on this whole line because they use natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>The price is reasonable for a natural conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>It really tames frizz and makes my hair so soft and silky.</li>
            <li>I really like the silk18 conditioner, one for the natural ingredients</li>
            <li>Today my hair is so soft and shiny and very manageable.</li>
            <li>hair is fine, half-wavy, tangles easily, and is still recovering from a lot of color and bleach damage from some poor choices.</li>
            <li>really can&#x27;t believe that this stuff works so well and is made from natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>I really like the conditioning properties to this natural conditioner.</li>
            <li>and so far I don&#x27;t notice as much of a difference as others have.</li>
            <li>I figured I found a great solution, but was mistakenly wrong.</li>
            <li>Also leaves my baby fine (but terribly dry) hair feeling soft and smoothe.</li>
            <li>So far I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had a soft and straight hair and</li>
            <li>I can tell a huge difference between the two, and now I am thinking that it would actually be worth it to keep buying this one despite its small size and cost.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair soft and very shinny.  </li>
            <li>It stands up to its name &#x27;Silk&#x27; and really makes my hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair extremely soft and look much healthier.</li>
            <li>It make my hair so soft, really touchable.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just make my hair smooth as I expected.</li>
            <li>have natural curly hair that I have struggled with my whole life</li>
            <li>So far I really like this conditioner-</li>
            <li>but my hair is very silky and soft.</li>
            <li>I have to use quite a bit of it to really get my hair conditioned, but I frequently do use a lot with all conditioners.  </li>
            <li>However, when I try natural shampoos they are very hit and miss.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft and very shining without all the chemicals.</li>
            <li>It is all natural and really shows.</li>
            <li>It leaves even my combination Brillo/Buffalo hair soft and very well moisturized.</li>
            <li>Worth a shot with the money back guarantee.</li>
            <li>It is gentle enough to use on the whole family!</li>
            <li>and my hair has actually looked better around the second and third day than it does on the first</li>
            <li>I normally had to deal with.</li>
            <li>but i&#x27;d say this is worth the extra money.  </li>
            <li>and I love that it is not filled with toxic chemicals.</li>
            <li>It smells like vanilla, and you can leave it on your hair for a few minutes while you shave, and your hair comes out silky smooth!</li>
            <li>My hair was so healthy after 2 years of doing nothing to it but always limp and lacked body.  </li>
            <li>I used to use volumizing conditioner from Big Sexy Hair and alternate with Ion&#x27;s Deep Repair Conditioner for color-treated hair, but results weren&#x27;t really consistent.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product to others and it is worth the buy.</li>
            <li>I wasted my money, since I won&#x27;t be able to tolerate the smell.</li>
            <li>I have crazy hair that needs to be blown out or straightened, and it dries on its own with Silk 18, looking soft and healthy.</li>
            <li>My hair is so dried out and thinning on top.</li>
            <li>I love the shampoo and will be purchasing it again, but this product seemed to heavy for my hair.  </li>
            <li>I reviewed all the comments and saw how much people love it, and my friend let me use a small amount of hers.</li>
            <li>I love that it conditions so fully, without leaving my hair limp or greasy.</li>
            <li>I should get my hair trimmed more regularly, but it&#x27;s such a pain finding a reasonably-priced stylist, who also knows how to deal with curly hair, that I tend to judge when I need to bite the bullet and get a cut, by when my ends become completely unmanageable and</li>
            <li>I normally use Deva products, but wanted to switch things up.  </li>
            <li>I had a noticeable line where my natural ash blonde was hitting the more brassy, dyed blonde that was bleached lighter from the brown hair dye phase.  </li>
            <li>Not one who normally likes a vanilla scent</li>
            <li>I use a few products and simply love them all.</li>
            <li>It dried my hair out and made it more damaged than before.</li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t write Amazon reviews, but I wasn&#x27;t a fan of this conditioner.</li>
            <li>The only reason I did not give it a 5 star is because I have not tried it that long and want to make sure it keeps</li>
            <li>I was using normal conditioners before this and after just one use I could feel and see a difference in the softness and shininess of my hair.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth the extra cost for the result.  </li>
            <li>the only drawback was the amount of conditioner, but it&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li>I just received it yesterday and tried it for the first time today and WOW sooo soft very manageable with a light feel for such a deep conditioner.  </li>
            <li>The good thing is the silky feeling didn&#x27;t last long as well but leaves my hair soft until next wash.</li>
            <li>Just rinse out lightly as it doesn&#x27;t really weigh hair down.</li>
            <li>I have long, very fine blonde hair with a natural wave.</li>
            <li>I love it and would highly recommend to anyone who needs to tame their hair.</li>
            <li>The second is that after applying it on my hair,quality of my hair is getting better, which i mean is silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>In other words, I have a lot of fine hair.</li>
            <li>and I think that works 100% better than this, for half the price no less!</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s not to love?&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use this conditioner, and came back to buy a bottle for my daughter whose hair is very wavy, long, tangles easily and is damaged from years of coloring.</li>
            <li>I have naturally coiled typed hair and live in a very humid environment</li>
            <li>Nothing special, my hair stays dry and unmanageable after using this product.</li>
            <li>This product actually caused my hair to become more dry.</li>
            <li>I then towel dry my hair and apply more from the mid section of my hair to the ends like a leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for more than a month and my hair - which is wavy and tends to be dry and frizzy - is definitely softer.</li>
            <li>This is great for thick curly dry hair.</li>
            <li>and how it made my hair super soft for the next 2-3 days.</li>
            <li>only criticism is that my hair is left smelling a bit like a sugar cookie with the strong Vanilla scent.  </li>
            <li>After using it a few more times, my hair has only continued to look and feel better - even now in the winter where I&#x27;m around dry radiator heat all day! -</li>
            <li>So the right “conditioner&amp;#34; is critical.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this stuff and suggest giving it time if you don&#x27;t see results right away.</li>
            <li>I bought this conditioner because I loved that all the ingredients have a low rating on skin deep, and my all natural shampoo was leaving ym hair very dry.  </li>
            <li>full of tangles, dry, frizzy.</li>
            <li>My hair isn&#x27;t super long, but it tangles a lot.</li>
            <li>I am also happy to use something in my hair what is not full with harsh chemicals.  </li>
            <li>I noticed from doing this my hair is becoming less frizzy.</li>
            <li>This conditioner was able to tame my mane.</li>
            <li>I would love to see larger batches made available at a bulk discount for serious customers.</li>
            <li>was very excited for this product, hoping it would help with my damaged hair, but ive found that applying coconut oil and shea butter to the ends of my hair after a shower worked the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dont waste your money, or if you do buy it on ebay new for $13.</li>
            <li>Worth giving a shot though, as it seems to make your hair manageable without putting a bunch of fake chemicals into it and definitely works better than cheap conditioners.</li>
            <li>Well, it&#x27;s dry right now as I type and am absolutely amazed by it.</li>
            <li>Well, it&#x27;s dry right now as I type and am absolutely amazed by it.</li>
            <li>I have very coarse and dry hair, and I&#x27;ve tried one too many natural conditioners from Whole Foods and Lush, with no results.</li>
            <li>The conditioner distributes easily throughout hair without leaving it feeling weighed down or greasy.</li>
            <li>I also get migraines and some strong smells really bother me, and this is not strong smelling at all.</li>
            <li>I can even use this conditioner on my roots, which I normally don&#x27;t do, as it isn&#x27;t heavy and rinses very clean, even in my softened well water.</li>
            <li>and I can even go without gel or any other styling products if I want which is a huge bonus for me.  </li>
            <li>Using this silk 18 conditioner in conjunction with this hair mask every other washing http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00I32AN4K/ref&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o05_s00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1 has made a huge difference in the texture and health of my hair.  </li>
            <li>which what other conditioners cause to my hair) and it made it really smooth.</li>
            <li>I wanted to move to sulfate free products to protect my hair color and found Maple Holistics and I won&#x27;t be using any other products on my hair.</li>
            <li>This product makes my hair feel smooth compared to other conditioners.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not very user friendly.</li>
            <li>Also, my scalp and nearby skin (neck, face, and upper back) are happy: no more itching or breakouts.  </li>
            <li>The end result was soft and a little more manageable.</li>
            <li>After rinsing out my old shampoo, I applied a quarter size of this conditioner throughout the body of my hair and then a little more at the ends.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair, but a lot of it, so it&#x27;s hard to find just the right conditioner.</li>
            <li>love that all of these products are economical, and a little seems to go a very long way.</li>
            <li>Ordering today again a new supply from them.</li>
            <li>New staple conditioner.</li>
            <li>I tend to invest regularly in new hair products, so</li>
            <li>I look forward to my new hair journey with this product.</li>
            <li>My new fav..</li>
            <li>I am adding this new comment...</li>
            <li>I live this conditioner.</li>
            <li>This is one of my new favorites.</li>
            <li>I had never heard of the brand before but was looking for a new conditioner and decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>I had been looking for a new conditioner/shampoo since I DESTROYED my hair using the &#x27;on sale&#x27; shampoos/conditioners...</li>
            <li>I am always looking for new shampoos and conditioners to try.  </li>
            <li>Depending where you live they could be using Chlorine,Chloramines or Monochloramines to purify the water.</li>
            <li>At this point, I had been using Tresemme&#x27;s curly hair conditioner for years, but decided it was time to test out new hair products, to see if that could help with this issue.</li>
            <li>This is my new line of hair products.</li>
            <li>Since using this conditioner,about 7 weeks,my scalp and hair have felt like new.</li>
            <li>We live in Hawaii and my daughter swims in chlorinated pools all week in addition to lots of sun and saltwater exposure.  </li>
            <li>I live in Kentucky where the water contains a lot of calcium.</li>
            <li>It has a very strong scent of vanilla, which I am not a fan of, but seems to be getting milder, the further down the bottle I go.</li>
            <li>8 oz bottle lasted about a month and a half, not bad!</li>
            <li>A lot of other natural beauty companies claim their products are amazing, when they&#x27;re really not, but I was very statisfied with my purchase here.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and live in a very dry climate, so it is hard to keep my hair healthy.</li>
            <li>I have been using this and it has made my hair feel better than other high end brands that I have tried such as Living Proof, Alterna, Color Proof, Redken, etc</li>
            <li>I have dry thin caucasian hair, and the first time I used it, the difference was truly remarkable.</li>
            <li>I did however send it back because I recently went fragrance free</li>
            <li>I tried using it in various ways, especially because I enjoy the smell.</li>
            <li>It has a nice, subtle smell.</li>
            <li>Anyway, after only my second use, my girlfriend complimented me on my smooth shiny hair.</li>
            <li>My 8 month old was born with a head full of long hair that I needed to start conditioning when she was a newborn.</li>
            <li>My whole family wants to know my hair care routine because of how different my hair looks.</li>
            <li>I just received this last week and have natural wavy hair (i have dyed for years) but do not use heating irons, curling  or even blow dry more than 2-3 times a week TOPS.</li>
            <li>I only wish there was a larger size available.</li>
            <li>This conditioner is kind of expensive but worth</li>
            <li>Before changing over to the better quality shampoo I had been using the bargain basement shampoo from target for a long long time.</li>
            <li>A few months ago I decided I am going to let it grow out again and have a pony tail like most of the old retirees I see around.  </li>
            <li>so my hair is super dry from the sun.  </li>
            <li>Along with a whole foods diet I have also been swapping out all my old chemical laden beauty and hair care products to natural products.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product mainly because it has natural ingredients in it</li>
            <li>but for free sure ill try it why not.</li>
            <li>I also loved the smell, very subtle vanilla scent.</li>
            <li>Also the fragrance of this conditioner is so pleasant and natural unlike the fake intense floral hair product out there.</li>
            <li>I love how NATURALLY soft my hair feels when I get out of the shower, versus full of junk that doesn&#x27;t wash out properly and leaves my hair dull.</li>
            <li>I have to be careful of conditioners too, because while I want smoothness and shine, and easy wet-combing, most conditioners weigh my hair down and make it look flat, even though I know not to put it on my scalp.</li>
            <li>and after my hair is very soft.</li>
            <li>phase if this will work for my very sensitive scalp (hoping it will).</li>
            <li>this made it very soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>I was actually very surprised with the results.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair very soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>It made my hair very soft and shiny, as well.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair very soft.  </li>
            <li>This stuff made my hair very soft, with a feeling like a toddler&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li>Leaves hair very soft, shiny and silky feeling...</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair very soft</li>
            <li>Not only are thousands and thousands of larvae killed in the process but silk worms have been inbred for so long that they cannot fly anymore and do not exist in the wild.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my hair very soft and silky.  </li>
            <li>This conditioner has a very natural vanilla scent to it that does not bother me at all.</li>
            <li>Also, I am very sensitive to EVERTHING</li>
            <li>My hair is very soft and shiny when I use it.</li>
            <li>I used this product along with purador shampoo and after using this my hairs feel very soft.</li>
            <li>Silk 18 leaves my hair very soft, silky, and manageable, and i can go out without straightening my hair often.</li>
            <li>but it does make my 4c hair very very soft.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair very soft, and the smell is like vanilla almonds.</li>
            <li>It made my hair very soft, silky, and manageable.</li>
            <li>it is very soft.</li>
            <li>hair is very soft and silky - and after 2 uses now, the dryness (friz) is about 90 percent gone.</li>
            <li>its very natural</li>
            <li>My daughter has eczema and very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair very soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair very soft.</li>
            <li>and it leaves it very  soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>I am highly endorsing this products to all my natural and non-natural friends.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many conditioners, but most left my hair weighted down, limp, and/or oily.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never instantly had, detangled, soft bouncy curls right out of the shower.</li>
            <li>but it was so strong and full of chemicals that it started irritating my skin.</li>
            <li>It hard to find natural products with a good price and actually work!!</li>
            <li>I have fine hair that is wavy, and I usually use conditioner from 100 percent pure, but now I&#x27;ve been alternating between this and</li>
            <li>I have very curly and coarse hair, and Silk 18 Natural Conditioner seems to be keeping it more manageable , less frizzy, and softer.  </li>
            <li>My hair felt very soft after the first use and the vanilla scent was lasting!</li>
            <li>And from the very first use, my hair has felt softer, less frizzy and 100% more manageable than with any other natural hair care product I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even need to blow dry or flat iron after washing (which is pretty much always necessary for a smooth style on my hair).</li>
            <li>My hair was not a tangled mess after I washed it, its softer than it usually is, and this conditioner has a great scent.</li>
            <li>Recently started growing out my hair into a mini-fro for the first time.</li>
            <li>Leaves my (silver)  hair silky soft!</li>
            <li>first time I used this conditioner I used it alone since I wanted to get a sense of its mousturizing capabilities so after washing my hair with the sage shampoo of the same brand and after apllying it</li>
            <li>My hair was soft, silky, and shinny!  </li>
            <li>The only downside is the price, but with all the benefits it has, I&#x27;m willing to pay for it.</li>
            <li>It may work better for other people, but overall I give it four stars.</li>
            <li>This is much better than the usual Pantene conditioner, or the drugstore hair conditioners I&#x27;ve used before.  </li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed was obviously the smell.</li>
            <li>I also use it on my 5 yr old daughter&#x27;s hair, and it leaves it gleaming!</li>
            <li>This seemed to work okay, but not as well as my other deep conditioners.  </li>
            <li>I tried this on my AA hair and wow!</li>
            <li>all natural  ingredients  and selling fast as my  sister  wants but it currently  </li>
            <li>After using this natura solution my hair completely changed and the difference was noticeable!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t believe this can be natural!</li>
            <li>I have never used something that makes my hair feel so silky and soft!</li>
            <li>Second, it really works!  </li>
            <li>This shampoo and conditioner made my hair so soft!</li>
            <li>This is extremely moisturizing and has a rich vanilla scent, which my husband likes.</li>
            <li>This conditioner made my hair feel so soft!</li>
            <li>You also can&#x27;t beat the fact that it is 100% natural and under $15!</li>
            <li>I applied a small amount and tapped it on top of my head</li>
            <li>I am pleasantly surprised by this conditioner!</li>
            <li>And wow!</li>
            <li>So far I am liking it!</li>
            <li>It made my hair so soft!</li>
            <li>After the first use there was an obvious change!</li>
            <li>and she said it made her hair soft and reduced the appearance &amp; feel of damage!</li>
            <li>Most other conditioner advise to only apply to the ends of the hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is so shiny and soft!  </li>
            <li>After my first use my hair has a silkiness it only has after being at the hair salon.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling soft and touchable!</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair, and this reduced the frizz in just one wash!</li>
            <li>$16 for a conditioner that lasts about a month is pretty steep, but I have been alternating its use with a regular brand of conditioner.</li>
            <li>Plus so natural!</li>
            <li>I also purchased the sage shampoo which is cleansing but not harsh on my color treated hair!</li>
            <li>WOW!  </li>
            <li>Leaves my hair silky and soft for days!</li>
            <li>WOW!  </li>
            <li>Only gave it 4 stars because this was my first use</li>
            <li>This conditioner has made my hair so soft !</li>
            <li>I was looking for a natural conditioner and found it!</li>
            <li>, therefore naturally prone to frizzy and fuzzy looking!  </li>
            <li>Sometimes I prefer to use hair products which usually target a more feminine &#x27;audience&#x27;.</li>
            <li>This completely damaged my hair to the extent that I could&#x27;t use any heat utensils like my blow dryer, straightener, etc because my hair would just literally burn off!</li>
            <li>I bought this along with the sage shampoo...perfect combination for sensitive scalp and no build up!</li>
            <li>I have tried countless products for my hair and this is the first time</li>
            <li>It was the softest it has ever been while using Silk18, my curls were soft and not frizzy, and required no leave-in product whatsoever!</li>
            <li>My hair is so soft!</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I am excited to try their other products too</li>
            <li>my hair felt so soft and looked shiny!</li>
            <li>I straighten it daily, so its pretty damaged as well.</li>
            <li>I first tried this after using a friend&#x27;s conditioner when I ran out last year, but I never got around to buying it because I forgot what the brand was.</li>
            <li>My first purchase and the above review was from 2014</li>
            <li>It is soft and I can&#x27;t stop running my hands through it!  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair so soft and shiny!</li>
            <li>Sticking to a low poo regimen and using this twice a week made my hair exactly how I&#x27;ve always wanted it to be:</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair shiny, soft and well hydrated!</li>
            <li>Makes my hair soft and silky!</li>
            <li>And, WOW!  </li>
            <li>My hair is now shiny for the first time in 3 years, my split ends are almost all gone (after second use)</li>
            <li>it made my hair as soft as my girlfriends!</li>
            <li>Her hair is so soft that I purchased another bottle for myself!</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m sitting in bed typing this having used the product for the first time last night with my hair softer than its been since I was a baby (I assume).  </li>
            <li>Hair was so soft, silky, and shiny after just one use!</li>
            <li>My hair is really soft and shiny!</li>
            <li>I have long, thick hair (mid-back length) and generally need a great deal of conditioner to even get the knots out.  </li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>After using it the first time, my hair went from straw to silk instantly...</li>
            <li>First used and instant results.  </li>
            <li>I usually have a lot of issues with tangling and frizz, but this made it a lot better.</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>safe.)&lt;br /&gt;Anyway... My only issue with this product is that they need to make a body lotion, or even a matching shampoo with this exact scent.  </li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I received the Silk18 conditioner in the mail yesterday and used it last night for the first time.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much for making a natural conditioner that actually works!!!</li>
            <li>My hair has never felt so silky soft before!</li>
            <li>so I try to stay away from the normal sulfate shampoos and instead use these kinds with natural oils and ingredients.</li>
            <li>Boy, was I surprised!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried various products and this has been consistent perfection.</li>
            <li>I put on the conditioner and left it in for a few minutes and my hair softened up a good bit, but it did not feel silky and it left me with lots of tangles to get out.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first time my hair actually feels clean and though my hair was left still a bit pouffy, it was definitely softer and felt lighter.</li>
            <li>It smells artificial and un-natural and just WAY too strong!!!</li>
            <li>Has the clean smell and viscosity of much more expensive, un-natural conditioners, but it Natural!</li>
            <li>It smells amazing, though subtle, and makes my aging hair soft, silky and shinier than it&#x27;s been in a decade.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have been on the hunt for an all natural conditioner for my super curly, dry hair for a while now.  </li>
            <li>and smooth, without being weighed down.  </li>
            <li>It also made my hair feel light and not weighed down.  </li>
            <li>I would not say frizz free, however, the frizz does die down for 2-3 days.</li>
            <li>It makes my frizzy damaged hair silk smooth without weighing it down.</li>
            <li>My hair tends to frizz quite a bit, and this conditioner makes my hair feel really smooth without weighing it down</li>
            <li>It does not weigh down my hair or leave any build up, which is important since I have issues with dandruff/psoriasis/itching.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair smooth without tangles and it does not weigh it down.</li>
            <li>I was really excited to try this conditioner, based on all the great reviews, but also a little skeptical.  </li>
            <li>Not only does it smell amazing, my hair looks shinier, feels softer, and didn’t take as long to dry.</li>
            <li>I also developed a little issue with my scalp becoming oily the day after washing my hair</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair, but it is thick.</li>
            <li>I have very fine but thick hair.</li>
            <li>Being a guy with wavy, &amp;#34;poofy&amp;#34; hair, I&#x27;ve always found it near impossible to find some kind of shampoo/conditioner that keeps my hair from drying out and becoming &amp;#34;poofier&amp;#34; as the day wares on.</li>
            <li>I have long, thick and fuzzy hair, after applying this conditioner, my hair becomes smooth and easy to comb.</li>
            <li>Really nice conditioner, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I have recently purchased this conditioner based on the reviews - being skeptical I wasn&#x27;t so sure if it would be effective or not, this is my second time using it</li>
            <li>product has made my high volume, naturally wavy, fine hair (read: shrivels and dries up at the flick of a straightener switch) soft and easy to tame without weighing it down.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to the world of natural hair products and have heard horror stories.</li>
            <li>My hair got so silky that now it&#x27;s kind of hard to control them!</li>
            <li>but it may have to do with the free product you get if you write a good review :-(</li>
            <li>The vanilla smell initially seems like it might be a bit much, but once you wash it out, it leaves a nice, subtle fragrance.</li>
            <li>I usually don&#x27;t like vanilla scent in beauty products, but it&#x27;s so light that it doesn&#x27;t bother me too much.  </li>
            <li>my fine hair had turned really dry and frizzy with the product I was using, so i went on Amazon looking for a deep conditioner.</li>
            <li>I have long naturally straight hair that responds very well to this conditioner.  </li>
            <li>My hair is nearly waist length, slightly wavy and fine</li>
            <li>It is definitely worth a try if you suffer from dry hair like I do.</li>
            <li>I am almost completely flake free now, and my red, dry scalp has returned to normal.</li>
            <li>It is not too heavy, leaving your hair easy to style.</li>
            <li>In the past I have always found either the consistency of natural conditioners to be off (typically more runny than what I prefer)</li>
            <li>Feels like normal conditioner, doesn&#x27;t do much for my hair (asian).</li>
            <li>and I think my family prefers it far more than the apple cider vinegar rinses I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li>then blue, which of course meant i needed to bleach my hair first because naturally I&#x27;m a brunette.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really NOT into super &amp;#34;feminine&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>yodaughter has thick tangly long hair which needs good conditioner.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not very thick</li>
            <li>This was taken after using Aussie shampoo/conditioner, letting my hair dry on its own for a little under an hour, and then using a diffuser to finish drying it.</li>
            <li>I have used many other products such as Clear and Pantene but they don&#x27;t nearly compare to this.</li>
            <li>I often have issues with conditioners leaving my hair feeling weighed down, but as soon as I rinsed it out, my hair felt light soft.</li>
            <li>I have shortish fine hair, did not help unravel my little tangles</li>
            <li>I have very thick, wavy, frizzy hair, so it was a surprise that it made it so smooth so quickly.</li>
            <li>It rinses clean unlike other natural conditioner&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I accidentally came across this product and read the reviews which turn out to be terrific and amazingly positive.</li>
            <li>I recently ordered this product after reading positive reviews on here.</li>
            <li>Transformed my fine, dry, color treated frizz back into soft, shiny, silky strands.  </li>
            <li>I have been natural for about 4 years and my natural 4a/4b hair loves this product as a leave-in conditioner!</li>
            <li>That being said, I LOVED the way this product left my hair feeling healthier and looking less dry and frizzy!</li>
            <li>She has thin mostly straight hair, and it reflected light really well after using this!</li>
            <li>In the last year, I have been diligently looking for a sulfate free conditioner for my 62-year old, long, mostly-dark brown hair.</li>
            <li>have not used this long enough to know if I Love it, but for the last week I have used it I do like it</li>
            <li>The only product that could get my hair soft prior to this was l&#x27;oreal&#x27;s  everpure conditioning mask, but that is full of chemicals.</li>
            <li>Yes I over process my blonde locks but also life changes have made for less hormones and more dryness.</li>
            <li>I have very coarse dry hair and stumbled upon this conditioner when searching for sulfate free shampoo.</li>
            <li>After trying waaaaayyy too many conditioners, I had finally resolved myself to an over the counter brand that if I used half cup at a time, I could manage to work through and detangle my hair in about 10 minutes in the shower.  </li>
            <li>The product worked very, and left my hair very soft.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for straight hair, but didn&#x27;t work well enough for us in the long run on my husband&#x27;s curly hair (whose problem with his unmanageable curly hair is the reason behind why we bought this product).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My husband and I have been using this conditioner for over eight times so far and have definitely noticed smoother and more shining hair for both of us (long and short hairs).</li>
            <li>Tried it right away since my hair was so dry.</li>
            <li>I am so excited to try all the other hair products from this line!</li>
            <li>excited to try out all of the other Maple Holistics products!</li>
            <li>I am really excited to try Maple Holistics&#x27; other products!</li>
            <li>I wish it was larger especially since I have to use more product since I have very long hair.</li>
            <li>This conditioner relieved my dry itchy scalp and left my hair really smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>Seems too heavy for my fine hair</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that I prefer more floral or fruity scents when it comes to hair products, but don&#x27;t you worry, it is not a deal breaker here!</li>
            <li>It is not too heavy or greasy for my ultra fine hair.</li>
            <li>As far as application - it has a nice, thick consistency, yet it spreads nicely through my long, thick hair.</li>
            <li>Several years ago, I realized how damaging certain chemicals were to my hair and skin</li>
            <li>obviously I would go more, but time and money are both tight.</li>
            <li>I have extremely thick hair and this conditioner was so gentle and made my hair feel so light and soft!</li>
            <li>I have very long, wavy hair with lots of grey covered by home coloring that tends to frizz easily.</li>
            <li>My hair is straight and fine but has never reacted negatively to conditioner before.</li>
            <li>I dry shampoo every other day which has caused some dry flakiness to occur on my scalp all around my face and right a the top of my hair.</li>
            <li>Nice smelling &amp; very thick.</li>
            <li>Tried on my colored, wavy, shoulder length hair, my teen&#x27;s very long and super thick straight hair, and my toddler&#x27;s long baby fine curly hair, all with success.</li>
            <li>A co-worker of mine recommended this product to me and with all this frizzy coarse curly mixed hair I&#x27;m always willing to try ANYTHING!  </li>
            <li>I will be 45 in a couple of weeks and have bleached my hair most of my life so it tends to get mousy and dull and dry/brittle</li>
            <li>It is hard to find healthy alternatives for a lot of the products out there.</li>
            <li>Good but a little heavy for</li>
            <li>I originally purchased two bottles of the Argan Oil Shampoo and was not a fan, since it left my hair bit to dry.  </li>
            <li>use Silk 18 as a conditioner and leave it in for about 5 minutes before rinsing out and have noticed a significant improvement in the softness in my hair and also, my dry scalp is starting to subside!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I let my hair air dry and for the first time in years, my hair was actually soft!</li>
            <li>I have dry damaged hair due to coloring my hair for many years.</li>
            <li>The way it made my hair feel is unbelievable, I have tried so many high end conditioners, deep conditioners, and hair masques and now of them compare to this!</li>
            <li>I have ethnic hair, so my hair is very thick and curly, since using the conditioner, it has left my hair soft every time and smells good.  </li>
            <li>I never find it leaves my hair dry or brittle, which I can say has been the result with many other natural brands.</li>
            <li>It makes a huge difference if you can leave it on for a few minutes.</li>
            <li>on the bottle it says &amp;#34;Complimented with soft natural vanilla undertones&amp;#34; I might not know what natural vanilla smells like because this smelled like a vanilla car freshener- like on of the trees you can hang in your car.</li>
            <li>Not only did it feel amazingly soft, it also made it really really shiny.</li>
            <li>It left my hair feeling extremely soft, shiny, and very healthy--which is saying a lot considering I fried the living daylights out of it by bleaching it.</li>
            <li>My husband got this for me for Christmas because I am very picky with my products (I want then as natural as possible).</li>
            <li>but he is bald so clearly would never need this</li>
            <li>I have hi-lighted hair and it has made it so soft and</li>
            <li>I’m always searching and trying natural products (make-up, hair, vitamins, etc).</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft, shiny, and manageable.</li>
            <li>I searched for a natural conditioner and Silk 18 came up</li>
            <li>but so far my hair is silky and soft.</li>
            <li>It is also naturally curly &amp; I straighten it once or twice a week.</li>
            <li>It became soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>After two months of use, it still keeps my hair silky and soft.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair but get keratin every 4 months to reduce the curl and frizz.  </li>
            <li>I have used SILK 18 for my natural hair.  </li>
            <li>am 52 yrs old, female/newly postmenopausal</li>
            <li>I also noticed that the smell was still in my hair even after a couple of days which surprised me.</li>
            <li>WOW.</li>
            <li>but WOW.</li>
            <li>And, it&#x27;s all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>Me and my daughter both have naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised by the results of trying this natural conditioner.  </li>
            <li>This conditioner leaves my hair so soft, manageable and</li>
            <li>how it&#x27;s all natural, sulfate-free, how it makes my hair easier to comb through.</li>
            <li>I have very curly and coarse hair and nothing seems to keep the &amp;#34;big&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>With this product I am liking my hair for the first time in a long time.  </li>
            <li>It is manageable, silky, soft and</li>
            <li>My hair become soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>Two starts for natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>My 26 year old daughter researched and found this conditioner, raved about it for days, so I had to try it.  </li>
            <li>I was worried that it would make my hair too mushy and that it wouldn&#x27;t hold the curls I was attempting to form, but it formed bouncy and soft yet defined curls as if I used a gel.</li>
            <li>My hair is currently very silky because of my use of Silk18 conditioner, and I would definitely recommend it to others.</li>
            <li>My hair was so soft and manageable after using it</li>
            <li>so I was surprised by the results.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel really soft.</li>
            <li>So far so goood.</li>
            <li>Everything listed in the ingredients was completely natural.</li>
            <li>It made my hair feel soft and helped with the dryness.</li>
            <li>I like the natural vanilla scent too.  </li>
            <li>I came upon it on a search for hair products that were natural.</li>
            <li>Another thing I like about it is that it&#x27;s 100% natural.  </li>
            <li>My doctor recommended me using all natural hair products and some treatments.</li>
            <li>Maybe for me a bit too soft, but I like the product as a protection for my hair.</li>
            <li>and I believe it&#x27;s because this product works with my natural oils rather than against it.</li>
            <li>I found that I cannot put too much on and only on the ends of my hair or it gives me a bit of a greasy feeling.  </li>
            <li>The only way I could really wear my hair</li>
            <li>naturally curly was</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, just to sum things up so far, I have been struggling with trying to get defined, soft, natural-looking curls for years.</li>
            <li>WOW</li>
            <li>WOW</li>
            <li>I would absolutely purchase this in the future.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair and have tried everything out there...</li>
            <li>I ordered Silk18 Natural Conditioner based on favorable reviews, and the fact that it has naturally based ingredients.  </li>
            <li>This conditioner is helping my natural hair shows its waves without the frizz</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely a heavy duty conditioner that leaves hair light and silky.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t make my hair as soft as I was hoping for</li>
            <li>It has a natural vanilla smell, not a chemical smell.  </li>
            <li>The bonus is it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li>Recommend to anyone looking for a natural conditioner without chemical junk.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair</li>

            <li>So far it is halfway gone</li>

            <li>This makes it feel soft and silky again.  </li>

            <li>and hair feels as soft as it has ever been.</li>

            <li>Hair feels soft and silky after use and it is natural.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hydrating and lightweight enough for straight hair without being too oily.</li>
            <li>- You need to use a lot of product in order to completely cover your hair.</li>
            <li>Vanilla is not my favorite scent, so while this is a negative imo, it might be a plus to others.</li>
            <li>but this far out weighs that.  </li>
            <li>this conditioner keeps my hair so soft..</li>

            <li>like my natural hair too...</li>
            <li>Leaves hair silky, soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had a lot of luck with natural products.</li>
            <li>The Silk 18 conditioner makes my hair so soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>Since I have an itchy, oily scalp, I will always refrain from using conditioners directly on it.</li>
            <li>A conditioner that offers everything that you want and nothing that you don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy and leaves my hair feeling really soft.  </li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m liking this product and hope to reach the 5 star mark with continued use.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a conditioner with natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>My hair has never been so soft and it is also not frizzy.</li>
            <li>and it is soft curls.</li>
            <li>so she can make the switch to natural products.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair sooo soft.</li>
            <li>It feels 10x stronger and it is so soft and shiny now.</li>
            <li>Not heavy, and leaved hair feeling really soft</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft.</li>
            <li>This makes my hair really soft.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my hair soft, but not greasy and does not damage color treatment.</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;m outside so much</li>
            <li>but I can say that I can rum my fingers through my hair without them getting caught and it feels silky and soft.</li>
            <li>and it makes my hair soft.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair soft.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Now, to the product… The reason that I bought this conditioner was because I had just gotten my hair professionally colored</li>
            <li>but it feels completely transformed after one use.  </li>
            <li>My face/body does not look like I am as old as I am ..</li>
            <li>Because it is a natural product I do understand the justification</li>
            <li>it makes my hair soft and shine</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a woman of color with naturally kinky hair, and this conditioner helped with my damaged hair and split ends.</li>
            <li>Truly cannot be beaten, and I have run the gamut on natural conditioners.</li>
            <li>It was just too soft.  </li>
            <li>It was soft.</li>
            <li>It is a soft vanilla smell.</li>
            <li>Also, my hair is oily but since i have been using Maple Holistics Degreaser shampoo along with Silk18 my hair&#x27;s oil has balanced out to where my hair is now soft and not greasy and oily.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very interested in trying out their other products.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised by this conditioner.</li>
            <li>if you are sensitive at all I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I decided to switch to an all natural conditioner thinking it would help.</li>
            <li>This stuff has also made my hair so soft.</li>
            <li>I switched to what I thought was a natural shampoo and conditioner brand, but it was not.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly/wavy hair</li>
            <li>and it made my hair extremely soft.</li>
            <li>This product is not 100% natural.</li>
            <li>I do not like a product with unnatural fragrance in it as I am sensitive to it and do not want my baby to be around it at all.</li>
            <li>The only issue I have that almost made me give it 4 instead of 5 stars is that the bottle doesn&#x27;t give you a whole lot for the price.</li>
            <li>but after using this product my hair is so soft and silky (beyond my imagination).</li>
            <li>- i&#x27;m sensitive to smells and have skin allergies.</li>
            <li>Makes hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been pleasantly surprised by this conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Now that I am nearly done with the bottle, my hair is not as soft as it used to be.</li>
            <li>so I follow with this moisturizing conditioner and my hair is soft and there&#x27;s no dryness.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t feel like it was absorbing into my hair, I left it in for about five minutes while in the shower.</li>
            <li>The Silk 18 Natural Conditioner was the number one seller on Amazon, but I still read the reviews and did some research.  </li>
            <li>So I was on the search for a Natural conditioner and Silk</li>
            <li>But I would want to give a try to the natural shampoo.</li>
            <li>so far this works, even my kids are using it.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a natural, color-friendly conditioner to revive my overprocessed, straw-like hair.  </li>

            <li>I was pleasantly surprised at the results after using this conditioner.</li>
            <li>My hair is so soft and shiny</li>
            <li>But the outer touch was soft.</li>
            <li>I was using another natural conditioner</li>
            <li>Instead, my hair was laying soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>natural ingredients that moisturize and protect.  </li>

            <li>I thought it left my hair very tangled and matted.</li>

            <li>it doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s doing anything to my hair like that silky feeling, but when it dries it feels so soft and looks shiny.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve bought over 10 bottles.</li>
            <li>you have sensitive skin (</li>
            <li>My hair became soft &amp; shiny after using this conditioner.</li>
            <li>Got Silk conditioner and Argan oil Shampoo a week ago, and so far I&#x27;ve used both in combination 3 times.</li>
            <li>The drug store conditioner made my hair feel soft, but look frizzy and undefined.  </li>
            <li>I am switching over to an all natural hair/face product line.</li>
            <li>Price seemed reasonable, especially with the sale that is going on.</li>
            <li>My hair was still soft, even after 10 minutes of t-shirt drying.  </li>
            <li>I feel like the natural women on those youtube videos that rave about a conditioner they just tried while they&#x27;re rubbing there hair in the mirror.</li>
            <li>I like that this is natural and my hair likes that it contains no sulfates.</li>
            <li>should I try next?&amp;#34; I considered switching brands completely, but knowing that Silk 18 is made with natural ingredients</li>
            <li>It also has helped with frizziness and had made my hair overall much smoother.</li>
            <li>Wow, what a difference.  </li>
            <li>Although my hair used to have a silky, lustrous  consistency, it has grown frizzy on the top  sections of late.</li>
            <li>Keeps my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>so far have made my hair noticeably softer and smoother.  </li>
            <li>Hair that I hadn&#x27;t felt since nearly fifteen years.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft and silky just like it said it would.</li>
            <li>within days I noticed a difference in my curly hair;  it feels soft</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll start off saying I was surprised at the size of the bottle</li>
            <li>conditioner made my hair sooo soft</li>
            <li>It makes it soft which in turn makes it manageable.&lt;br</li>
            <li>if you switch between this conditioners every so often, with this, then your hair will continue to be soft.</li>
            <li>/&gt;THE SMELL: natural vanilla.</li>
            <li>It reminds me of that vegan store called Lush (naturally hand made products for skin, hair, etc.)</li>
            <li>Not to heavy and has a light vanilla scent.</li>
            <li>oh-so-soft, and completely detangled my hair.</li>
            <li>During the time that I waiting for it to arrive and not using any conditioner, the shedding stopped -- completely.</li>
            <li>Either there is something in this conditioner that shouldn&#x27;t be in it, or I am personally sensitive to one of the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>Leaves your hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m all natural and have been for 2 1/2 years.</li>
            <li>Maybe because I&#x27;ve been using natural shampoo for months now.</li>
            <li>Not a heavy conditioner</li>
            <li>It leaves their hair extremely soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>I occasionally use a tiny bit as a leave-in as well, but is rarely needed.</li>
            <li>This conditioner leaves my hair smooth and soft without leaving a heavy residue.</li>
            <li>so I have to use a lot of product and this is more expensive, but it is totally worth it to me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m definitely going to order a few more bottles.</li>
            <li>I only shampoo a few times a week - at most - and use the product each time.  </li>
            <li>I have only used it a few times and every time my hair looks better.  </li>
            <li>Oops, a few more gross details about my hair and habits.</li>
            <li>It is thick conditioner, and don&#x27;t need to use  too much to get smooth healthier looking hair.</li>
            <li>But overall i felt its a good product but felt it to be bit expensive as it really hasnt worked wonders.</li>
            <li>It is thick and luxurious and I love that it is a holistic product.</li>
            <li>the type of person that loves my hair products to smell good, this product unfortunately doesn&#x27;t have a smell.</li>
            <li>but kind of thin and watery.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it&#x27;s still a good product, just not what I was expecting.  </li>
            <li>I use essential oils for cleaning, instead of over-the-counter medications and in my massage business,-it&#x27;s nice to find a product that&#x27;s up to my high standard for natural purity and as a bonus was worked like a charm to tame my curly mane!</li>
            <li>These last months I keep traveling between two different climates: one is very hot and very humid, the other one is extremely dry, cool and windy.</li>
            <li>I have very frizzy long hair and live in a very humid Australian climate.</li>
            <li>This conditioner does not feel heavy and oily--it is light and fluffy and works perfectly for my hair, which is very thin.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair silky smooth, and i notice LESS frizzies when i use it!</li>
            <li>I have thick wavy hair that can get pretty dry, and this product has helped my hair retain more moisture, as well as prevent frizz.</li>
            <li>It is very frustrating since most of my hair is straight, but the tangled regions look very fractured and damaged, even after combing it out.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many different conditioners to tame my frizzy hair</li>
            <li>LoveThis prosuct tried it once and it made my hair so soft and healthy feeling without have the itchy thick conditioner scalp my hair felt clean for quite a few days and stayed soft.</li>
            <li>but if you have long hair or if you need to wash your hair often, you will definitely go through this bottle rather quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not entirely sure why a company would make a natural conditioner and then scent it so strongly.</li>
            <li>When I was using devacurl it was way more expensive, and it left my hair smelling super strongly of herbs, which I disliked.</li>
            <li>but it actually feels normal now!</li>
            <li>Managing my long, thick hair can be overwhelming at times especially when I would like for it to be soft and pretty!</li>
            <li>plus I noticed is that even though we&#x27;re having really humid weather right now where I live, my hair didn&#x27;t pouf up like it usually does.  </li>
            <li>(i.e. a small amount easily covers my head</li>
            <li>my hair is pretty dry because I always bleach my hair for coloring and highlights .</li>
            <li>I also wanted a conditioner that was sulfate free to allow my curls to actually form since 2c and 2b hair tends to be thinner than other curly hair types.</li>
            <li>I bought this conditioner completely unaware of the other products available.</li>
            <li>so well I don&#x27;t use as much as with other shampoos, very efficient.  </li>
            <li>After I bleached my hair couple times, my hair start hating me and became pretty dry.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t get past the horribly strong &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34; of vanilla.</li>
            <li>It costs a little more than what I usually spend on hair products, but I think it is absolutely worth it.</li>
            <li>I have coarse greying hair, and in recent months with more grey areas coming in, my hair has become totally unmagageable with cowlicks sticking up everywhere when I get up in the morning.  </li>
            <li>In fact, it&#x27;s probably not as soft as it is when I use conventional conditioner, but it&#x27;s worth it because of the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>That being said, it is not priced like many similar natural products that are equal in results, it is very reasonably priced as a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>As a result, I will need less argon oil to keep my dry ends healthy and go longer between trims.</li>
            <li>I can actually air dry it without having super poofy, frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair is SUPER dry and this actually works.</li>
            <li>I also love the natural, subtle vanilla scent this conditioner leaves.</li>
            <li>I got lucky with thicker full head of coarse, dry and frizzy mess with out product.</li>
            <li>I have had snarly, fine hair for my entire life and can vividly recall crying and protesting, throughout my early childhood, while my mother tried to brush through my hair.  </li>
            <li>left my hair so straight and easy to straighten; I have never straightened my hair with a flat iron in less than 10</li>
            <li>Left my hair feeling amazing after only a few uses!</li>
            <li>This smells like vanilla (ok), makes some of my hair feel soft (ok), but it makes my hair tangle like CRAZY!  </li>
            <li>What I really love is that a little goes a long way and I can apply it from roots to ends</li>
            <li>Because I did not add anything else to my hair before flat ironing, it feels so much softer.    </li>
            <li>Because of this I think that some of the broken hairs that I have at the  front were actually a bit more flyaway at first, but not in the frizzy way they used to be.  </li>
            <li>I only wash my hair twice a week and it stays soft even on the days I only rinse with hot water.</li>
            <li>It is kind of a small bottle for the price, which may be the only draw back.</li>
            <li>Most all natural shampoos and conditioners are pretty expensive, so when I saw this one on &amp;#34;sale&amp;#34; for $10.77, I figured I&#x27;d give it a try.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to try their other products in the near future.  </li>
            <li>You also barely need to use any for your hair to be soft!</li>
            <li>I have long, curly, frizzy hair that is tough to get a brush through without a good conditioner</li>
            <li>My ends in the shower even feel dry, and I generally finger detangle my hair and spend too much time carefully picking apart fairy knots and using hand full after handfull of conditioner to get through my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After my hair was destroyed by a botched professional bleach job, I searched high and low for a product to save the remnants of hair.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need very much of the product, a nickel size is usually enough to coat my hair, so this product will hopefully last me months.</li>
            <li>some not - and the baking soda/apple cider vinegar method, most of which either made my hair too dry, or had the opposite effect and left my hair greasy and matted-looking by the next day.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t really subtle despite what some people say, so make sure you like vanilla before buying this.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>with our well water, it rinses out cleanly and leaves my long, fine, thin hair feeling and looking great.&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li>I have fine, straight, shoulder-length hair, which is naturally dark blonde, but I have been coloring for a number of years to cover the grey.  </li>
            <li>This is ok, but I have used better products that were less expensive.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many products over my 55 years that it is ridiculous.  </li>
            <li>, it has a nicer, more subtle scent.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product for anyone with dry hair or who simply wants a natural product that creates a soft texture.  </li>
            <li>I felt since I have done hours of research on different conditioners (including this particular one)</li>
            <li>so I only use about a dimes worth but it just seems to go a long way.</li>
            <li>I use a decent, but not too big amount, start on my ends and work my way up, then comb it through and leave on for a couple minutes.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it was on a &#x27;wash only&#x27; day, as I shampoo only 2-3 times a week.  </li>
            <li>After several weeks of using, I came to the conclusion that this shampoo delivers exactly as desribed by the seller because I am seeing some obvious improvements in which regards the look of my hair.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s not homeopathic in any way) on the bottle, wtf is up with that?</li>
            <li>Regular conditioners do not make the cut, so I went on Amazon and searched for cruelty free under conditioners (under beauty) and sorted by average customer review.</li>
            <li>and I think its a better product than any of the higher end and expensive lines.</li>
            <li>Also I&#x27;m not a fan of fragrance, but this is shampoo has a very subtle vanilla smell which is nice.</li>
            <li>I originally ordered Silk18 Natural Conditioner (and the Maple Holistics Teatree Oil Shampoo) for my granddaughter who recently had head lice and had to have her very long, curly hair cut short after chemical lice treatments.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine but frizzy hair and this conditioner provides just the right amount of weight to my hair to prevent crazy frizz, while still staying soft but not oily looking.  </li>
            <li>It does not seem to moisturize as well as I expected, but my hair isn&#x27;t dry, so I suppose it&#x27;s more that this conditioner isn&#x27;t ridiculously rich &amp; thick like store brand conditioners.</li>
            <li>This conditioner instantly makes my stressed out hair relax and smooth down.  </li>
            <li>I have long, fine blonde hair, and have never loved a hair conditioner so much!!!</li>
            <li>The products are a little on the costly side for such a small amount, but hey, it&#x27;s worth every penny if I&#x27;m able to wear my hair naturally and get compliments!</li>
            <li>I emailed them, telling them what had happened, and they they promptly sent me a FULL SIZED product to try,  instead of the little sample bottle.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard of the no-poo method, but I&#x27;m not willing to deviate enough to feel that my hair isn&#x27;t clean or conditioned.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this conditioner, but the only con I would mention is the smell.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for anyone and especially my fellow curly girls!</li>
            <li>Overall I highly recommend trying this.</li>
            <li>highly recommend and I will definitely be purchasing again!</li>
            <li>I definitely plan to keep on using this product and recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>And I highly recommend this to you if you have similar problem.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve searched high and low for a conditioner that doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy looking and feeling after washing with it.</li>
            <li>I have seen major differences in the last two months since using this product, my hair is soft, smooth, and much less brittle...</li>
            <li>I have been looking for new all natural hair care for some time and this product is a total answer to my prayers!</li>
            <li>I have major issues with my hair!  </li>
            <li>also like the fact that they are chemical free - compared to your typical big box store offerings</li>
            <li>This conditioner really does the job of leaving my dry hair well nourished and soft after a shampoo treatment.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve really noticed a transformation from my once unruly, super thick and curly hair.</li>
            <li>I like to leave it in my hair overnight and feel like it moisturizes just as well, if not better, than the chemical filled alternatives.</li>
            <li>Used as just a regular conditioner it de tangled my hair and left it really shiny and soft</li>
            <li>and (for me) lasts almost as long because you don&#x27;t have to use as much.</li>
            <li>(I clog the shower drain every time I shower because I shed so frequently), coarse hair normally.</li>
            <li>I normally use salon brands only but figured I&#x27;d give this a try</li>
            <li>I am completely natural and I only use natural products!</li>
            <li>But I actually end up using about 1/4 the amount of conditioner that i normally would.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I tried my deep conditioner that I use normally, a salon brand deep conditioner, my normal conditioner, I even tried the eggs and mayo remedy.</li>
            <li>My first time using this conditioner my hair was pliable when wet</li>
            <li>love the results I got from using this, but this bottle would last me a very short amount of time, used it while traveling around America for a few weeks</li>
            <li>first couple tries I was using it, it did not help detangle my hair when I went to brush it.</li>
            <li>Finally I noticed a true difference that isn&#x27;t seeming to go away with each use as is the case with other shampoos and conditioners.</li>
            <li>As a male, the last thing I wanted was for my hair to smell like a baked good or, worse, a Yankee Candle all day.</li>
            <li>This is a really quality products that smells good, nourishes the hair very well, and isn&#x27;t full of any nasty and potentially harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li>I usually don&#x27;t even let the conditioner sit for more than a minute before rinsing and it still conditions very well without leaving my hair weighed down and greasy.  </li>
            <li>Second, since I have very fine hair, I only need to use a small amount on the ends and it already smooths out my hair.  </li>
            <li>This left my hair very soft with less frizz, and more shine, absolutely no oil or weight traces.</li>
            <li>I love keeping a tiny little bit in my hair after rinsing for soft hair all day long.</li>
            <li>No more itchy scalp and my hair is so clean and soft.  </li>
            <li>Really liked it, as it left my curly, thick hair super soft plus no frizz in the south Carolina&#x27;s humid late spring this year.</li>
            <li>My hair is very dry and this product made it very shinny and soft without weighing it down.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now my hair is very fine and thin</li>
            <li>I have very fine, thin hair and</li>
            <li>This product helps in keeping my hair more normal and less dried out then before when I was not using &amp;#34;Silk 18&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I have bleached my hair, had perms done, and a lot of heat damage, but this stuff brings my super long asian hair back to life.</li>
            <li>I have a short afro due to me embracing my african american roots, I went full on natural and this product is number oe for me !!!</li>
            <li>Leaves your hair nice and soft especially if you have long thick hair.</li>
            <li>I let my hair air dry and what a huge difference from other conditioners.</li>
            <li>I usually have super sensitive skin and break out to almost everything I try and use!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also full of alcohol and not seemingly all that different from conventional conditioners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>noticed immediately after my first wash with the shampoo followed by this conditioner that my hair was unbelievable silky and smooth, unlike any other product ive used, and believe me ive tried many.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is my new daily shampoo.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my new standard conditioner.</li>
            <li>I live in southern California</li>
            <li>I live in the desert in Southern California and this products works!  </li>
            <li>I have long hair, medium thickness, with a pretty tight curl and after a week of using Silk18 my hair curls from roots to tips in consistent rings and</li>
            <li>However, I am not certain I like it better than Maple Holistics&#x27; other similar Argan conditioner.</li>
            <li>I have extremely dry damaged hair and this conditioner really helped with that.</li>
            <li>I thought the conditioner really helped moisturize my dry scalp and relieve any itchiness.</li>
            <li>but because I bleached my hair, it became very damaged, dry, and unmanageable.</li>
            <li>Really helps moisturize my hair which is getting dry as it grays.  </li>
            <li>Over the summer my hair has become really brittle and dry from the sun and chlorine.  </li>
            <li>My hair is dry and very freezy..</li>
            <li>and it really helps my waist length dry hair.</li>
            <li>I have very curly dry fizzy hair and this conditioner works wonders.  </li>
            <li>I really like the product and would recommend it if you have dry hair and want it to feel softer.</li>
            <li>omggg this made my hair super soft and i have the type of hair that gets so rough n dry after washing</li>
            <li>My ends are frazzled and dry, but I really didn&#x27;t want to cut my hair.</li>
            <li>she couldn&#x27;t believe how much it had grown in such a short amount of time!</li>
            <li>Though this might sound unappealing, I was actually extremely excited to feel the strange texture because this meant that it really was unlike any other product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Very waxy and really leaves a heavy coat if you don&#x27;t use a clarifying shampoo in between uses.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a black woman with long, fine, wavy hair.</li>
            <li>Also i was unsure about buying this because some natural products (such as natural bug spray) don&#x27;t work as well as they claim.</li>
            <li>I have dry, frizzy hair and was left with soft, healthy, bouncy curls after leaving it on in the shower for a few minutes.</li>
            <li>Even the parts that are dead were soft and looked really fresh.</li>
            <li>It feels much stronger, looks fuller, and actually stays feeling conditioned after washing for several days</li>
            <li>After trying numerous conditioners, I have finally found this product that really works.</li>
            <li>I have natural hair and makes my hair feel so soft after is use the same brand for dandruff shampoo.</li>
            <li>For the last 3 years it has been really struggling, breaking, falling out, and has been extra tangley and unmanagable.</li>
            <li>Left my natural, coily hair soft and detangling was a breeze.</li>
            <li>The conditioner leaving my thick hair soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Our hair is soft and not dry or &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; feeling.  </li>
            <li>Treat your hair well, it really can add or take away from your overall appearance and overall self esteem.</li>
            <li>I have straight hair in the front and coarse curly hair in the back.</li>
            <li>The difference doesn&#x27;t really make sense as both projects list all the same ingredients and in the same order, with the one additional ingredient of &amp;#34;natural vanilla fragrance&amp;#34; added to the Silk 18.</li>
            <li>and wow it felt thick and smooth, even the ends.  </li>
            <li>I have only used silk 18 for few times and it gives my hair a smooth finish.</li>
            <li>On top of all that, I have continuously bleached my hair for more years in a row than I can count (hair dressers hate me for it,</li>
            <li>Okay, so I ran out of conditioner and was using some really drying (and ironically expensive keratin shampoo) for a week before I received this conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I love using this, and I think I will slowly transition into only using Maple Holistics brand for my hair.</li>
            <li>Work well, conditions without being super heavy.  </li>
            <li>It turned my 35 year old dry brittle hair back to my soft silkie 20 yrs old hair!!!</li>
            <li>My hair is very long and fine and this did not weigh it down.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You can store it upside down or right side up.</li>
            <li>Still trying to pin down the right shampoo from there line that works for my dandruff</li>
            <li>second beef is that the conditioner doesn&#x27;t go very far.</li>
            <li>It has left my hair very soft and silky after using it.</li>
            <li>It left my hair feeling very soft and silky.</li>
            <li>I have a friend who is very sensitive to perfumes and she has no problems sitting next to me</li>
            <li>The only drawback for me - I am very sensitive to smells</li>
            <li>I have been using Silk 18 as a leave-in conditioner every other day for the past week, and it has already made the middle of my hair much softer and more mousturized.</li>
            <li>The only reason I gave it 4 stars is due to the strong smell of vanilla that lasts long after the shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Love the vanilla scent &amp; leaves my hair so soft, will not go back to buying any other shampoo&#x27;s or conditioners other than Maple Holistics!</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t be switching back to my old conditioner again!</li>
            <li>No other conditioner has tangles my hair the way this product does.</li>
            <li>There is no other conditioner on the market that can match this product.</li>
            <li>The consistency is similar to Tresemme&#x27;s Natural Avocado Conditioner and the smell is heavenly!</li>
            <li>No other complaints.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now on my second bottle, my hair is silky and soft!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s free from harsh chemicals AND leaves my long hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li>I used it with Totlogic 2 in 1 shampoo and body wash and in my entire life, my hair has never been this soft!</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m outside and busy!)</li>
            <li>Silk 18 left my hair soft, manageable and my curls were shining like the stars!.  </li>
            <li>Wow! Where to start on how this conditioner has totally saved my hair!</li>
            <li>I felt a major improvement after one use.</li>
            <li>I have only used this three times, but I already see a difference in how soft my hair is!  </li>
            <li>I have coarse, wavy, color treated hair, and my hair has never felt so soft or looked so shiny!  </li>
            <li>Had no other expectations besides those.</li>
            <li>Using this conditioner my wet brush slides right through not only when my hair is coated in conditioner</li>
            <li>I have dry damaged hair, it makes my hair soft and normal again thank you.</li>
            <li>No more static or dry hair</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I paired this conditioner after the Argan Oil shampoo (which also worked beautifully by the way), and thoroughly brushed it through my long longs and waited at least a few minutes before showering.</li>
            <li>I just take a small spray bottle and put half of the silk 18 and the other half water, shake it up real good.....</li>
            <li>The argan and jojoba oils along with other natural ingredients have really improved the dryness of my processed hair.  </li>
            <li>I have very wavy/curly hair &amp; have a big problem with frizz as I let my hair dry naturally</li>
            <li>it was too heavy didn&#x27;t saturate and actually made it more dry.</li>
            <li>This, for instance, is mostly coconut oil and water, with shea butter and a few other oils.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Maple Holistic&#x27;s products are not exactly cheap, but I definitely think the products are worth the money!</li>
            <li>With lots of fine hair, I do have to take it into consideration that, perhaps a person with thick hair may like it.</li>
            <li>This conditioner just seemed to work for my thick but fine hair.</li>
            <li>I have very curly ethnic hair that tends to get very dry.</li>
            <li>Perhaps my hair is dryer than the average Jill, but I feel like the bottle is going way too fast, especially since it&#x27;s not super cheap.</li>
            <li>I have to pretty carefully ration-out my conditioner-use when I&#x27;m in the shower, but on the plus side, this stuff is so creamy and nourishing, that I don&#x27;t have to use as much on my roots as I used to, when I was using other conditioners.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But the real thing I love is how crazy soft my hair is!</li>
            <li>Last January when I first stumbled across this product, I was very skeptical due to all the great reviews but decided to go ahead and give this conditioner a try.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, it takes out the tangles, and my hair is smooth as it gets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Truly, a little goes a long way with this, so I feel the price is justified.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to squeeze out, but the product itself is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say there is anything special about the way my hair feels - it&#x27;s not silkier than usual.</li>
            <li>Silk 18 made my hair shiny, and it helped the curls clump better than the other brand I was using, but it also made my hair kinda stiff and crunchy.  </li>
            <li>I only use organic shampoo and organic products and this fits right in with all of my other products.</li>
            <li>If you diy you know that beauty/skin care ingredients - depending on what they are - are actually quite cheap and that only a little is used in a product.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair easier to brush, smells good, and only takes a little bit in my extremely thick hair.  </li>
            <li>Having thin hair, I often struggle with finding a conditioner that does not weigh my hair down, and this one washes out clean and my hair feels light afterward.</li>
            <li>a side note, it is kind of hard to squeeze out of the bottle unless you have it stored upside down</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t a bad conditioner, but it isn&#x27;t great.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately, it hasn&#x27;t done anything amazing for my hair.  </li>
            <li>I had hoped the Silk 18 conditioner would calm her unruly dried out hair.  </li>
            <li>This conditioner gave my fine flyaway hair lots of body and shine, however after a few uses it made my hair seem dry with lots of frizzy</li>
            <li>I hope to continue seeing progress in my current state of hair health as I am transitioning from relaxed hair to my natural hair.</li>
            <li>I will continue to shop here in the near future.</li>
            <li>Not only did it make my hair feel soft and silky, but I was not shedding hair when I was applying it on my hair and after rinsing it off.  </li>
            <li>And each time, my hair was left soft and silky without my worrying about excess hair falling out.   </li>
            <li>Let me start by saying I have 3B/3C natural mixed race hair and my number one biggest problem is dryness.</li>
            <li>so I tried it and it left my hair so saturated and soft</li>
            <li>Not only did it untangle my hair but my hair was so soft for days.</li>
            <li>Left my hair feeling really soft.</li>
            <li>It made my hair extremely soft and supple as I styled for the following day.</li>
            <li>No regrets to invest on this product.</li>
            <li>I thought it would make my hair soft and silky and help detangle after washing, but it did just the opposite.  </li>
            <li>The results/difference are apparent immediately after use.</li>
            <li>I have gone through the gamut of natural, paraben-free, sulfate-free shampoos and conditioners, until finally stumbling upon the Maple Holistics brand.</li>
            <li>I used it only 3 times so far</li>
            <li>I like trying different conditioners for my natural hair.</li>
            <li>I tried several natural hair products but they made my hair unmanageable,tangle;therefore</li>
            <li>I wanted to find a product that was all natural but actually worked, which until now, i didnt think was possible.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>u should tried u won&#x27;t regret it and finally found it a natural product that I can use for as conditioner and leaving and</li>
            <li>I can barely get a comb through it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this product once so far but reviewed it thoroughly before purchasing</li>
            <li>My hair actually felt soft.</li>
            <li>I am natural and recently straightened my hair and acquired quite a bit of heat damage</li>
            <li>This product left my hair silky soft, and got my waves under control.</li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t cut it nearly often enough.</li>
            <li>I tried consecutive use for 2 weeks and had to switch back to my old conditioner because brushing my hair became a tangled nightmare.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t want to use my natural look as much as possible...</li>
            <li>So those who are saying that apparently need to brush up on their reading comprehension skills.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>My hair and I have been searching for and trying out &#x27;natural&#x27; shampoos and conditioners for several years.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I only wash my hair once or twice a week so not to over strip the natural oils.</li>
            <li>It left my hair so silky and soft.</li>
            <li>I have only used this conditioner once so far.</li>
            <li>together they left my hair soft and shiney.</li>
            <li>We use it daily and leaves hair feeling incredibly soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>My hair has become dry as I have gotten older and also use color.  </li>
            <li>After one use all my hair is the same soft shiny texture.</li>
            <li>I get compliments on how shiny &amp; soft my hair is &amp; washing/combing is not such a chore after using it.</li>
            <li>By day 2, the frizz from my hair is completely gone and the shine is back!</li>
            <li>When I discovered SILK I immediately cancelled all future shipments of my old brand.  </li>
            <li>I was searching for a natural shampoo and conditioner after trying multiple products, including leave in conditioners and oils.  </li>
            <li>Leaves hair feeling silky and soft, even the next day&lt;</li>
            <li>I am the happiest I&#x27;ve ever been with my hair outside of a professional treatment.</li>
            <li>Yes, it left my hair soft and manageable after using the Maple Holistics Argan Oil Shampoo, Sulfate Free.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>Which definitely were NOT dried or damaged.</li>
            <li>Secondly, (I&#x27;ve only used it twice so far)</li>
            <li>Completely revived my hair in a way that left me speechless..</li>
            <li>You just have to be careful with how much of this you use.  </li>
            <li>So far my only quarrel with the product is pricing</li>
            <li>/&gt;Maple Holistics Natural Conditioner gets my approval especially if you&#x27;re not concerned with the cost (whatever it</li>
            <li>I have natural ash blonde hair</li>
            <li>Perhaps it is because I used the Tea Tree shampoo for my scalp prior to using this conditioner, but my hair did not feel soft and &amp;#34;nourished&amp;#34; after I used it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going back to my old standby:</li>
            <li>This helped me bring my hair back its old luster.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using it for about 2 weeks, but so far it&#x27;s a keeper.</li>
            <li>Male, early 30-s.</li>
            <li>Then, after very scrutinized and careful research and reading of hundreds of consumer reviews, I came across Maple Holistics.</li>
            <li>my son, 26 years old recently mentioned he had an uncontrollable dandruff problem, and nothing he tried worked.  </li>
            <li>This conditioner left my hair silky soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my coarse hair feeling so soft.</li>
            <li>I have switched over to using only natural products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m older, and my hair is so dry</li>
            <li>The effect is similar to applying silicones in your hair, but this is natural.</li>
            <li>Silk 18 has actually managed to give my hair the BUSINESS by making my hair retain a soft moisturized feel for now 6 days.  </li>
            <li>My husband has thick caucasian hair that tangles, and this conditioner has helped keep his hair smooth and manageable.</li>
            <li>And it has a subtle vanilla sent which I prefer over the strong smelling hair products.</li>
            <li>(I usually always use a shampoo conditioner combo for full effect).</li>
            <li>Seems like a random drawing kind of thing to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am not impressed with this conditioner, but to be honest my hair needs a lot of work.</li>
            <li>not too expensive, good for daily use... definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li>I read reviews about this product and decided to give it a try, though honestly I was a bit skeptical that it would work as well as people claimed.</li>
            <li>it is worth trying it for a few weeks to see if it works for your hair.</li>
            <li>I was very skeptical for a number of reasons, but mainly because so many people with positive reviews had coarse, curly hair.  </li>
            <li>I was really let down by this conditioner , I clearly was not looking for a miracle in a bottle just a product that would&lt;br</li>
            <li>The conditioner is nice and thick meaning the product is not watered down.  </li>
            <li>It even dries frizz free with very little to no styling product!</li>
            <li>I have very fine, thin hair, relatively short.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying to use it a little more sparingly, but it has still only lasted me about 3 weeks for every other day use for medium length hair.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for dry and damaged hair.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this conditioner for dry hair or any hair for that matter.</li>
            <li>I live by the ocean and swim in saltwater daily for the entire year!</li>
            <li>After the very first use it left my naturally wavy thick hair soft and supple.</li>
            <li>I have really coarse, dry, chemically straightened hair, and this conditioner works really well.</li>
            <li>so I started looking for an affordable natural product that made my dry hair soft and did not have cones.</li>
            <li>i have dry color treated hair and so far silk18 is making my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>The smell as everyone claims is a dreamy vanilla and just letting it soak in for 2 minutes before rinsing it off made my hair super soft and the frizz is reduced by at least 80%.</li>
            <li>Those chemicals you are absorbing while taking a shower dry out your hair and skin big time.</li>
            <li>When my hair is feeling extra dry, I just put a squirt of this on the ends and they feel much softer.  </li>
            <li>This stuff, I use much less than I normally would, then follow up with my normal bit of moroccan oil...</li>
            <li>Although the bottle seems smaller than a typical store-bought conditioner, it&#x27;s well worth it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so difficult finding a GOOD conditioner that works on my dry, brittle, frizzy, unruly curly hair.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the smell of cheap perfumes, Wen Haircare products, and other conventional hair products.  </li>
            <li>I only have this conditioner by MH, but it works great with other random shampoos that I have lying around the house.</li>
            <li>I have very little hair, and on top of that it is extremely thin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Sadly, though, with my fine short hair I got more of a limp result.  </li>
            <li>Also a little goes a long way which is nice because when I initally got the bottle I was surprised by how small it was.</li>
            <li>First, I have very fine curly hair that will frizz if I don&#x27;t use a conditioner and would be impossible to comb out after a shampoo.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I used as much as a typical high-end conditioner would require.  </li>
            <li>With the two,my hair falls a lot less and within the first week I noticed the immediate change in the texture and look of my hair.</li>
            <li>I am not one that uses conditioner that often because it tends to make my hair look greasy and dirty but after using the Natural Conditioner I fell in love!</li>
            <li>No big difference, and much higher in price then other products</li>
            <li>I got this (and several other stuff from &amp;#34;the amazon&amp;#34;) yesterday.</li>
            <li>I got this (and several other stuff from &amp;#34;the amazon&amp;#34;) yesterday.</li>
            <li>Over the past two years, I have transitioned my diet and products I use from traditional to organic and Eco friendly.</li>
            <li>This is the first natural conditioner that didn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling dry and stringy or extremely greasy.  </li>
            <li>I did a simple blow out after washing and using the product and I have used no other products on my hair as I wanted to see what the raves are all about!  </li>
            <li>My hair is very dry and frizzy and used to be thick and course, but has been thinning significantly as I&#x27;ve gotten older.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend to people with dry hair!</li>
            <li>I normally have very dry coarse african american hair and my hair did become soft and stayed soft even after I washed out the conditioner.</li>
            <li>I accidentally used to much and it didn&#x27;t affect my hair as other products would.</li>
            <li>I have medium, straight-wavy hair that has been falling out a bit due to illness, and this conditioner makes it feel much better.&lt;br /&gt;Update:  </li>
            <li>I will absolutely be trying other maple holistic products out because of this conditioner.</li>
            <li>she had very tangled hair and is extremely tender headed.</li>
            <li>It is 3b curly type hair (cuacasion hair that is very curly in some areas and wavy in other areas and tends to be frizzy).  </li>
            <li>I use a very small amount and it conditions my hair thoroughly with a light vanilla scent that lasts.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see much of a difference when compared to other conditioners though.</li>
            <li>do not have any real smell as compared to other brands.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve really messed up my hair with other products including the baking soda</li>
            <li>In my opinion, both the shampoo and the Silk 18 conditioner seam to complement each other really well.</li>
            <li>(I don&#x27;t see how some of the other people reviewing it could go through the whole bottle in just 1 week).</li>
            <li>It took us a long time to find a natural product that worked!</li>
            <li>I agree with other reviewers--a little does go a long way; however, I still feel like $13 should buy more than 2 months worth of conditioner (and I condition my hair every other day and also have long hair).</li>
            <li>I have really long hair, and it just takes a little bit to do the full length.  </li>
            <li>My hair looks more alive and less dull.</li>
            <li>My hair looks more alive and less dull.</li>
            <li>and I live in Phoenix so it is getting dry on the bottom portion.  </li>
            <li>My hair is seriously silky smooth</li>
            <li>I was always afraid of conditioner because my hair can get really greasy and oily real quick, but I read that curly hair needs moisture, so I gave conditioners a try, as well as trying to go &amp;#34;no-poo&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;lo-poo&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I love the smell, I was afraid that it would be too much</li>
            <li>My hair seemed to go through a dry spell, but I was using a different shampoo (common store brand), so I switched to Maple Holistic&#x27;s hydrate shampoo to see if it compliments the silk18 better.  </li>
            <li>It will definitely help to condition your scalp and, if you are a sometimes-dandruff sufferer, like I am, the combination of this conditioner with the occasional use of any tea-tree oil shampoo, should really help to get rid of any dry scalp problems.</li>
            <li>For specific ethnic groups, daily hair cleansing strips the natural oils required to prevent brittle hair.</li>
            <li>I was at the point where I felt completely discouraged, since everything I tried prior to Silk 18 had lots to desire in the final results.</li>
            <li>I also love the smell of it, it doesn&#x27;t smell fake, it smells like vanilla and natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>I still needed to use some all day conditioner and oils to keep it hydrated, but this is the only natural conditioner I have used that actually  has worked for my hair.  </li>
            <li>Not only silky and soft, but I smelled of vanilla the entire day!</li>
            <li>This is the ONLY natural conditioner I have found that actually works.</li>
            <li>I can not say it enough, These shampoos and conditioners try to put back the natural oils that these chemicals in the water are taking out.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve tested several conditioners throughout the years, but this is the only one that makes my hair this soft and frizz-free.</li>
            <li>Also it seemed like near my scalp was constantly oily, but I usually only apply the conditioner to my ends.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not dry and frizzy</li>
            <li>does not dry my hair out after blow drying.  </li>
            <li>Works okay for my relaxed hair but left a medicine like smell behind.</li>
            <li>Smells nice, but honestly my thin curly hair did not really benefit from this conditioner.</li>
            <li>This conditioner is super thick, really stays on my wet hair without dripping off while I shave my legs.  </li>
            <li>I have many daughters with long hair and have had such a hard time finding an organic conditioner that actually works.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product if your hair is in rough shape...</li>
            <li>Just to further help others in need of moisturized, beautiful hair:  when my cousin came for a visit she asked about what I was using on my hair... needless to say, she jumped at the opportunity to take an extra bottle of the product I had in my closet when I offer it to her in case she wanted to try the conditioner for a few days herself.</li>
            <li>I have extremely  dry hair and this condition completely turned my hair around after one use!</li>
            <li>I have long, fine, thin, fragile, dry, natural, pin straight, caucasian hair.</li>
            <li>Silk 18 is more expensive (especially considering how much conditioner I use), but I&#x27;m a sucker for natural products and the reviews made it seem promising.  </li>
            <li>I can not speak as to the health aspects, but as a conditioner it does not work any better than any other natural health food store conditioner at less than half the price.</li>
            <li>Giving it 4 stars(more of 4 and 1/2) as I think bottles are bit too slick and so holds less quantity, should be more for the price.</li>
            <li>Luckily, you only need to use a small amount.</li>
            <li>I have spent many of wasted money on salon products only to find out that they make my hair greasy or dry.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried every high end product under the sun and found that most of them weigh my thin, curly hair down.</li>
            <li>And the interesting thing is that my hair takes less time to become dry and less frizz</li>
            <li>I was looking for a conditioner that would make my hair silky and soft for a long time.</li>
            <li>I have naturally wavy long hair</li>
            <li>Additionally, the Natural Conditioner doesn&#x27;t leave any gross residue on your skin like other conditioners and, hello, it&#x27;s all natural!</li>
            <li>My hair has not been this soft for a long time.</li>
            <li>for long time my hair hasn&#x27;t been that soft after I used this product .</li>
            <li>I am 64, and it makes my long hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I use it on my 13 inch long beard, split ends are gone and it is manageable and soft.</li>
            <li>Leaves my corse grey colored hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t been this soft or shiney in so long.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s under the hot sun a lot and exposed to salty harsh ocean water as well as chlorine.</li>
            <li>The vanilla frangrance is fresh and natrual I usually wash my hair before bed and the vanilla scent helps to sooth to sleep.</li>
            <li>Bought a few bottles to try it for the first time.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time conditioner did not make my hair limp and lifeless.  </li>
            <li>My hair is noticeable softer after just the first few washes.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, I can only say that I liked it and this will probably be only a one time purchase for me.</li>
            <li>I tried this conditioner for the first time a few weeks ago and I will never get anything else.</li>
            <li>Even though this product is not cheap, but for what it does I&#x27;m willing to pay the price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to find a conditioner that works to soften without weighing down my fine hair, and this is it!</li>
            <li>I leave a little of this in my hair, not completely rinsing it, and I have shiny soft locks that have pretty individual curls after scrunching gel into it after I get out of the shower.</li>
            <li>I kept on using the conditioner and realized that it&#x27;s actually very moisturizing for my scalp and doesn&#x27;t make my scalp greasy or weigh down my hair afterwards</li>
            <li>It worked really well to keep frizz down through the day.</li>
            <li>Really people need to pipe down.</li>
            <li>I really like that it doesn&#x27;t fade my color out or feel like it&#x27;s weighing it down, either.  </li>
            <li>so it is very noticeable if I use a product that weighs down my hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ready to also try some of their other products!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little more than I usually spend on conditioner</li>
            <li>I just bought our 5th bottle (although it is worth noting that a little does go a long way, however with my daughter being a swimmer, she is washing/conditioning every day</li>
            <li>just because I have dry hair.. rinsed with coldest water possible.. for frizz,.. and then blow dried with cool air.</li>
            <li>It detangles, softens and it makes my super dull hair shine.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s very dry and feels like straw, but after using this conditioner my hair has never felt so soft!  </li>
            <li>I recently switched to using shampoo bars, because I heard that conventional shampoos really damages the hair.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and would try out other products from Maple Holistics without any hesitation.</li>
            <li>Other conditioners I&#x27;ve owned only made my hair feel weighed down and full of chemicals</li>
            <li>natural conditioner is making my hair softer I also noticed that it&#x27;s not falling as much not sure</li>
            <li>Silk18 makes my hair look less brassy, and evened out the shape of the curls and made them much bouncier.</li>
            <li>I let my hair dry naturally</li>
            <li>My damaged, dry, frizzy hair comes out soft and shiny after drying.</li>
            <li>My hair is much easier to comb through and have noticed less breakage.</li>
            <li>I still have to put some natural product in my hair before letting it dry, but I expect that.</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally curly, dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li>I have dry and naturally curly hair and have always bought store shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>Quality products, from a trusted company, combine to make my previously dry hair luxuriously soft and fantastically fragrant.</li>
            <li>I have naturally course, dry, curly blond hair.  </li>
            <li>so it gets oily near the roots and dry at the ends.</li>
            <li>In just one application, my hair was transformed from dry and brittle to soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>It makes my dry brittle hair feel so silky and soft.</li>
            <li>( After using the shampoo and conditioner together I noticed my hair was very silky and seemed to have less frizz.  </li>
            <li>I only need to use a dime size amount and it completely coats my long hair with a emollient silky feel.</li>
            <li>but it is 53 year old hair and grey is starting to peak out.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I step out of the shower and damp dried my hair, then comb it and hours later still no frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>I have dry, thick, damaged hair, and always struggled with finding shampoo and conditioner that wouldn&#x27;t leave my hair even more dry.</li>
            <li>my easy to manage hair became brittle, greasy, and seriously thin.  </li>
            <li>and this isn&#x27;t a super thick formula.</li>
            <li>This conditioner made me hair extremely shiny &amp; soft!!</li>
            <li>After using this for the first time last night, the comb glided right through it and there were very few hairs in my brush after when brushing after it dried.</li>
            <li>I left it on my hair for about 2 minutes while in the shower, and the end result was my hair feeling very silky without being weighed down --</li>
            <li>Because this product doesn&#x27;t weigh down your hair and is able to soften thick unruly hair; I would recommend it for all hair types.</li>
            <li>and I was pleasantly surprised at how soft and shiny my hair was compared to when I use other conditioners!</li>
            <li>Would certainly recommend this product, though it is a little pricey...</li>
            <li>When I rinse it out, I usually leave a little in my hair, it isn&#x27;t greasy or stiff, it smells good and helps with the frizz.  </li>
            <li>(in terms of length, it&#x27;s about 3-inches below shoulder-length right now, when dried and curly) and I&#x27;m long overdue for a haircut</li>
            <li>or I may have to alternate with another natural conditioner that is less expensive, but I do really love this!  </li>
            <li>My hair is very long thin &amp; color treated too &amp; after trying many products (esp conditioners)</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair and need that extra conditioner because my hair tends to be dry.</li>
            <li>I allow my hair to dry naturally to avoid heat damage and to reduce and further frizziness.</li>
            <li>It left my hair tangled, and once dry it wasn&#x27;t really soft.</li>
            <li>Also, the bottle is way too small, I have long hair, so it goes quickly.  </li>
            <li>these products work well for a week or so, but unfortunately, the tips of my hair then start getting dry and brittle, and for some reason the products aren&#x27;t effective for long-term use.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair that used to be dry and brittle until I tried this product!  </li>
            <li>could I pull the comb through the bottom 6&amp;#34; of a small section of hair without it becoming a knotted mess?</li>
            <li>I have fine and thin hair...</li>
            <li>this conditioner made my fine thin curly hair feel like burlap rope.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to see if this could work on my hair which is fine, thin and color treated.  </li>
            <li>I have natural loose curls that tend to frizz on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>/&gt;BTW - Maple Holistics offered to refund my money for the Argan Shampoo and send me a new bottle of their new and improved Argan Shampoo since I was not completely satisfied with it.  </li>
            <li>I have very dry, brittle, naturally curly 60-something hair.  </li>
            <li>But on the whole, I&#x27;ll probably switch to this one and just spritz with a little water and oil to make up the difference.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need much, just a little thermal protector, after I rinse out the Silk 18.</li>
            <li>This is the first natural conditioner that de-tangles my (long) hair, without irritating my (very sensitive) scalp.</li>
            <li>I have been trying to combat the new texture of my hair and extreme dryness.  </li>
            <li>I have fine, thin, hair and this product has totally transformed it!!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think the price is a bit high for an average family for the size of the product</li>
            <li>My hair is coarse , dry and long plus I live at elevation in the Rocky Mountains.  </li>
            <li>This made my very healthy hair extremely dry, so dry it was difficult to brush thru.</li>
            <li>A little bit goes a long way, and it works SO fast!</li>
            <li>so it takes a little more time to wash thick hair thoroughly without tangling it.  </li>
            <li>I have shoulder length, very thick wavy/curly hair that two months ago I had stripped from red to light brown with highlights.</li>
            <li>But within the next few hours and overnight, I had large red welts and a rash around my jawline, chin and next to my ears.</li>
            <li>The other thing is that this conditioner really helps to moisturize my dry hair.  </li>
            <li>I have long thick wavy hair, and once upon a time in my life my hair was soft and very very shiny.</li>
            <li>The usual little frizzy hairs that go wild in the Midwest humidity are much tamer than normal.  </li>
            <li>I  have dry hair due to styling tools  my hair did become soft and stayed soft even after I washed out the conditioner.</li>
            <li>I was a little skeptical at first because it wasn&#x27;t as thick and creamy as my usual conditioner, but this stuff is awesome!  </li>
            <li>leaves hair very soft and it last longer than other cont.</li>
            <li>and I do not have to sacrifice a bad hair day to use a product that is good for my hair and skin.</li>

            <li> this product is really good</li>
            <li> Perhaps it&#x27;s the combination of both on my hair, but it ends up being too much of a good thing for me.  </li>
            <li> and I still have good body for my styling,</li>
            <li> I could feel the difference and loved it.</li>
            <li> and it looks good strait.  </li>
            <li> Smelled good, did good job moisturizing.</li>
            <li> The vanilla aroma like others said is so good smelling.</li>

            <li> The package arrived in good condition</li>
            <li> Plus, I&#x27;ve also started getting tons of compliments from friends about how good my hair looks, since I started using this</li>

            <li> Loved the conditioner.</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved it.</li>

            <li> In her words, she loved that the product came sealed.  </li>
            <li> I bought the sage shampoo and looked for a product from maple so as to have a good combination of products.after use , it leaves my hair softer and not feeling drained.thank</li>
            <li> The conditioner is good and silky but its like getting ketchup out of a glass bottle.</li>
            <li> it is a good product and will buy again.</li>
            <li> Good but not as extremely good as I respected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really good.  </li>
            <li> Gorgeous.</li>
            <li> honestly works great</li>
            <li> The Silk 18 conditioner, however, is really good.</li>
            <li> Does a good job with moisturizing and as a tip</li>
            <li> The silk18 conditioner smells so good like coconut.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I did not find Silk 18 to be a good conditioner, hence the 3 stars.  </li>
            <li> It is, however, a good leave-in or curl cream type product for my hair.  </li>
            <li> This made my hair feel good, but it&#x27;s not a miracle worker.</li>
            <li> I loved the smell and the way my curly hair detangles after conditioning.</li>
            <li> Good product for the price.</li>
            <li> and it smells like vanilla so good.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for something that would be good on my color treated hair and add moisture.  </li>
            <li> I think this is a good conditioner.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> good customer service.  </li>
            <li> The smell is awesome and it leaves my hair so smooth.</li>
            <li> The vanilla scent is very pleasant and is not too strong after you rinse it off.</li>
            <li> I agree that if you stick your nose in the bottle, it is strong but if you rinse it out of your hair, I find it very pleasant.  </li>
            <li> I bought it and am very impressed with how silky rich it feels, and my tendency toward oily hair is not exacerbated which is always my fear with conditioners.  </li>
            <li> Most surprising to me is that the scent lasts for days!</li>
            <li> , I was not disappointed and the conditioner is awesome !!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I was not disappointed and the conditioner is awesome.  </li>

            <li> Loved this smell of this conditioner, very subtly sweet and delicious.</li>
            <li> I have very easily tangled hair and need a conditioner that does a great job with the knots.</li>

            <li> Love, love, love! !!!</li>
            <li> Awesome conditioner :) :)</li>
            <li> My hair is smoother and silkier and the mild aroma of vanilla is wonderful.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is awesome for women with super frizzy, course hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There&#x27;s nothing exceptional about this conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I tried more than a fair share of products for my hair and am so, so happy that I came upon this conditioner.</li>
            <li> This product smell wonderful a nice light vanilla smell.</li>
            <li> It smells awesome and the ingredients are great for those naturals that are really cautious with chemicals in your products</li>
            <li> After receiving graduation money as a gift, I decided to invest in some good conditioner, and I am so glad I chose Silk 18!</li>
            <li> But I will say it does make hair very smooth and shiny, which feels great when the hair dries.&lt;br</li>

            <li> I love love love this!!!</li>
            <li> Love it, love it, love it!!!</li>
            <li> Love love love this conditioner!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a delicious vanilla scent that becomes more mild but still smells great over time.</li>
            <li> My hair always feels very Healthy</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t be more happy to find this product.</li>
            <li> I ordered this on a whim because the company seemed very reputable</li>
            <li> My hair feels more luxurious than it&#x27;s felt in years, and if it could, no doubt would be doing a happy dance for all the nutrients it&#x27;s now being fed with this conditioner.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and my hair feels great after using it.</li>

            <li> Smells great and leaves my hair silky smooth!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I have purchase Silk 18 twice now and am very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> The shampoo is great and I am so glad I bought it, but this conditioner does nothing for my hair.</li>
            <li> This conditioner smells great and leaves my hair shiny and more manageable.</li>
            <li> Thank you, we are both very satisfied</li>
            <li> Great product,  love it</li>
            <li> Works great, and the value/price balance is ok at $12.</li>
            <li> I am a cologne addict and still see how great this fragrance is and the magic it does to my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair also always seems healthy and happy after as well.</li>
            <li> after one use I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> It has valiantly fought through my abuse with the help of this product, and I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li> very pleased with the products and Maple Holistics as a seller.</li>
            <li> curls looked great when they were done drying, but I won&#x27;t be able to use the conditioner again.</li>
            <li> lovely conditioner that smells great and has changed my hair.</li>
            <li> The smell was like fresh wonderful vanilla.</li>
            <li> love the smell and feel of this in my hair, great product</li>
            <li> I am sure it would be great for any hair type.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I think part of the problem is that there is keratin in this conditioner which is great (makes hair shinier, stronger) but for some people if you use this conditioner more than once a week it will be drying for you.</li>
            <li> I have to say I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for 30 days and am very pleased.</li>

            <li> This is the absolute best conditioner I have ever used!</li>
            <li> I have been looking for an organic shampoo for awhile now, My friend recommended me to try this because she said it was nice and made her hair feel nice.</li>
            <li> or I have had a problem with my hair just seeming kind of lifeless after their use, but not with this Maple Holistics conditioner.</li>

            <li> The vanilla and honey is so nice.  </li>
            <li> The scent is nice, kind of vanilla almond.</li>
            <li> This conditioner also smells good and my kids love the smell.  </li>
            <li> so I can give an honest opinion of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This was very moisturizing and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> Also, it make my hair (and me as a whole) smell delicious all day!</li>
            <li> the smell is really nice like vanilla my hair like a lot so now is gonna be in my list of the month</li>
            <li> I really liked it.</li>
            <li> Even if I had liked the smell to begin with</li>
            <li> However, when my hair is healthy and I take care of it, it is gorgeous.  </li>
            <li> Nice to have a product that works this well without a bunch of chemical ingredients.</li>
            <li> I could nicely run my finger through my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair kind of smells like spiced vanilla or root beer,</li>
            <li> and I am absolutely thrilled.  </li>
            <li> Nice conditioner with a nice scent.</li>
            <li> Honestly, if you&#x27;re paying a ton for any beauty product, you&#x27;re wasting your money.</li>
            <li> Nice product</li>
            <li> have been using this conditioner for 3 days now, and am thrilled.  </li>
            <li> This conditioner  is gentle and wonderful!</li>
            <li> I loved finding a conditioner that is chemical free and won&#x27;t damage my hair anymore!</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length hair that I wash with sifted rye flour (best no-poo shampoo I&#x27;ve tried) or occasionally a whole egg.</li>
            <li> A warm Vanilla smell.</li>
            <li> The formula is spectacular; the smell is enticing almost like maple syrup.</li>
            <li> Since my hair is colored I was looking for something that was both effective as a conditioner but would not strip the color.  </li>
            <li> The vanilla scent is nice, but stronger than I would like in a conditioner.</li>
            <li> Well I have a kind of wavy and somewhat curly hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a vanilla kind of person.</li>
            <li> The company ethics match my own, or I would not have bought it.</li>
            <li> My hair feels nicely conditioned and is not unruly after using silk 18.  </li>
            <li> I have no idea how this conditioner got sooo many good reviews.</li>
            <li> Not time effective.</li>
            <li> , I remember my hair was kind of damage</li>
            <li> and this works better than 90% of things I have tried, but the price is good.  </li>
            <li> This is a good product, it is one of the better conditioners i have tried.</li>
            <li> This is a nice conditioner</li>

            <li> scent is a really nice vanilla that doesn&#x27;t stick around after the shower is over; your hair will be natural-smelling once it dries.&lt;br</li>
            <li> These products are really nice for my hair.</li>
            <li> i love it my hair become good .no loss</li>
            <li> yes, it did make my hair feel nice (silky) and</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best conditioner (and shampoo)  </li>
            <li> A nice conditioner.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I didn&#x27;t have huge expectations because my experience with &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; beauty products hasn&#x27;t been great.  </li>
            <li> I am returning this product and plan to make my own conditioner using organic aloe vera from the organic plant, mixing it with water and spraying on my hair as a detangled</li>
            <li> Nice aroma, not overpowering.</li>
            <li> I really liked this conditioner.  </li>
            <li> It has leaves a nice vanilla smell in your hair and works to loosen up your hair.</li>
            <li> I think this is a nice conditioner.  </li>
            <li> It smells really nice.</li>
            <li> I liked trying shampoos and conditioner, and when I came to this silk 18</li>
            <li> I used this conditioner today and I really liked it.</li>
            <li> I honestly bought this because it was on sale</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a honest conditioner to my frizzy brittle hair</li>

            <li> I have used every type of organic conditioner and really feel that this is the best conditioner for my hair.</li>
            <li> SO nice- like vanilla.</li>
            <li> I found a product I really liked</li>
            <li> I found it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tentatively added nothing to my hair after conditioning - no oils or &#x27;defrizzing&#x27; agents - to see how Silk 18 would hold up on its own.</li>
            <li> It smells nice and my comb just glides through my hair when I apply it</li>
            <li> my hair feels very silky after but not oily- its a great balance!</li>
            <li> really nice .I</li>
            <li> Excellent product and fast service.  </li>
            <li> A lot of conditioners I have tried leave a &amp;#34;film&amp;#34; which feels kind of greasy even after rinsing.</li>
            <li> Even my boyfriend told me my hair looked exceptionally nice the day I used the conditioner.</li>
            <li> since I know this is an honest company now.</li>
            <li> That really shows what a great product this is!</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money-- and the best part, it smells fantastic!</li>
            <li> My mother owns her own beauty salon</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving the results.  </li>
            <li> I leave on my hair for like 30mins before I rinse with warm water</li>
            <li> Thrilled that I found this product.</li>
            <li> Nice conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Aubrey Organics Island Naturals or Honeysuckle Rose Conditioner.</li>

            <li> this was so nice my friend took it.excellent for damaged hair</li>

            <li> I really liked the result</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving it.</li>
            <li> It was about as good as most conditioners from the drug store.</li>
            <li> I really liked this conditioner.  </li>
            <li> It seems to works incredibly well, and I loved how soft my hair was and how it looked afterwards, but the hair loss horrified and disturbed me!!!</li>
            <li> This conditioner is very good, but I didn&#x27;t feel the silkiness right out of the shower, like I would if I used some of the chemical-ridden conditioners.</li>
            <li> First use and I already see AMAZING RESULTS!!</li>
            <li> It is light, yet very effective.  </li>

            <li> It has a wonderful smell and I could not believe how much better my hair felt after the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> Great product, makes my hair feel silky and clean.  </li>
            <li> I find the scent very mild and pleasant.  </li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m not a fan of the very strong warm vanilla smell after that ...</li>
            <li> smells awesome, and my hair is so silky and soft!!  </li>
            <li> It has amazing slip and best of all, it&#x27;s a natural conditioner!</li>
            <li> Love the feel of it, nice and creamy, the smell is awesome but not too much (vanilla scent).</li>
            <li> It makes my hair so silky smooth and smells like warm vanilla sugar!</li>
            <li> It smells lovely (like coco butter) and leaves my hair very smooth!</li>

            <li> Smells very nice too, a clean vanilla smell.</li>
            <li> This conditioner sounded too good to be true, but I thought at this point it couldn&#x27;t get any worse-could it?!</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s better because it&#x27;s sulfate free and made with so many good ingredients for your hair!</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve tried just about every kind of conditioner under the sun and this one is by FAR the best with both quality and price.</li>
            <li> The pleasant smell, the consistency, and the silkiness of my hair after use is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Smells great and serves to detangle, but does not yield any extraordinary result.  </li>
            <li> Pleasant vanilla scent is light and not overly perfumed.</li>
            <li> I loved the way it made my hair feel and was easy to manage and style.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good, but the smell is strong.</li>

            <li> I have kinky/curly hair and this product makes my hair very easy to detangle.</li>

            <li> I used a probably pea size amount of Silk18, &amp;  it glides through all my hair very easily.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very strong in the shower but fades once your hair dries.</li>
            <li> Very strong perfume smell.</li>
            <li> It was very easy to comb through it.  </li>
            <li> It runs through my hair very easily.</li>
            <li> First impression when I opened the bottle and took a whiff: delicious sweet vanilla scent, yum!  </li>

            <li> My story is that I have been struggling to find a conditioner that didn&#x27;t make my hair fall out any more than it should.  </li>
            <li> and thus I got rid of all my drug store bought items and switched to products that were more organic.  </li>
            <li> and I am so glad I decided to try it.    </li>
            <li> Finally, I have found a hair conditioner that works wonderfully.  </li>
            <li> Smells incredible, no harsh or toxic chemicals.</li>
            <li> Must buy more.</li>
            <li> and although I could skip the conditioner between washes; this is also a good substitute if you don&#x27;t need to wash after a couple days but want your hair to look fresh.</li>
            <li> I will update more about this product in the coming weeks</li>
            <li> I have never been able to go a day without shampooing but my hair day 2 is better than day 1</li>

            <li> Love this stuff...</li>
            <li> and it maybe lasts 2 or more days.</li>
            <li> but I was never truly satisfied.</li>

            <li> I have so many chemical allergies</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered 2 more</li>

            <li> I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd or 4th bottle, and I&#x27;m a happy camper!</li>
            <li> I bought this conditioner based on reviews, and I love it.  </li>
            <li> Often I would cause even more damage by straightening it, and then proceeding to curl it to avoid frizz.</li>
            <li> if this worked on my hair texture, I feel extremely confident in saying that you should not be worried about encountering yet another dud</li>
            <li> This conditioner doesn&#x27;t seem to offer many benefits for my hair.</li>
            <li> I love the way my hair smells after I use this.  </li>
            <li> I love this conditioner.  </li>

            <li> This conditioner works wonders:)</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner.</li>
            <li> It has a delicious smell and leaves my hair feeling soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> But it does make it softer which I love. :)</li>
            <li> It felt better than I can ever remember.</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping it would make my hair more moisturized.</li>
            <li> I Love it ..</li>
            <li> This conditioner is ok.</li>
            <li> Would recommend, but not my favorite.</li>

            <li> Great product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> It gets better by the week</li>
            <li> just in one use you will fall in love.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure with all my experience of Conditioners</li>
            <li> I am able to comb it and the frizzyness is no where to be seen.</li>
            <li> Good good conditioner, I have tried  Kerastase Nutritive Bain Satin 2 Complete Nutrition products, Moroccan products but these conditioner is the one for my frizzy, damage hair, split ends.</li>
            <li> I came across this product and decided to give it a try, and I&#x27;m glad that I did.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I love the smell</li>
            <li> and I love the ingredient list</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t love how my hair feels during and after using it.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this, but the search continues...</li>
            <li> I really love this conditioner.  </li>
            <li> If you love vanilla you&#x27;ll love this product.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t love the fact that it had leaked all over the inside of the packaging.  </li>
            <li> After blow drying I could not help but notice how healthy and shiny may hair looked...</li>
            <li> her scalp has not been so healthy ever - and she is now a devoted user too.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner.</li>
            <li> It works best when left on hair for about 5 min or more before rinsing.  </li>
            <li> My hair has never felt better than when I started using this conditioner.  </li>
            <li> It looks so much better</li>
            <li> it made my hair softer, smoother and more moist, I like it a lot, 4 stars for not showing any directions to use or even ingredients on the bottle</li>
            <li> and I love that it is holistic in nature</li>
            <li> Love the product.</li>
            <li> my Amazon purchased ID #1140173554-2268229 :)  22 Clenning Street, Nepean Ontario, K2J 5B2  </li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> This product could not have come at a better time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Sage shampoo which I love</li>
            <li> so I tried this and love it.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> i love it.</li>
            <li> mostly blow drying.. and its just easier, and nicer for me to wear my curls then to just straighten It</li>
            <li> It feels overall healthier which is great!</li>
            <li> I love Maple Holistics</li>
            <li> Smell was ok.</li>
            <li> and I love applying the Silk 18 as my follow up conditioner.</li>
            <li> so glad I ordered</li>
            <li> I love how silky it makes my hair in the shower.</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing conditioner, my hair is silky smooth.</li>
            <li> When I use this product, I have to use more conditioning products  to soften my hair before blow drying.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> Per the included usage tips i made sure to use the conditioner everywhere, not just the ends of my hair.</li>
            <li> I love the result.</li>
            <li> really wanted to love this, since the ingredients are great</li>
            <li> I really love ALL of the Maple Holistics shampoo&#x27;s and conditioners.</li>
            <li> and I like it better than my H&amp;S conditioner.</li>
            <li> I really love the smell.</li>
            <li> I was afarid I would be loosing quality, but this is actually better than anything I&#x27;ve tried before.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner.</li>
            <li> My stylist tells me that my hair is extremely healthy and that the products I am using in my hair are working well.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many products.  </li>
            <li> It worked even better when I made sure just to apply the conditioner to the ends of my hair and not the scalp.  </li>
            <li> I have paid more for conditioner that didn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li> I will purchase more.</li>
            <li> SUCH A GREAT CONDITIONER!!!</li>
            <li> I totally LOVE the scent</li>
            <li> This conditioner contains most of the ingredients I was planning to treat my scalp with.  </li>
            <li> will have to use it for a bit before i can tell for sure</li>
            <li> I hope to see more of a difference as I keep using this conditioner.</li>
            <li> , it makes me feel better knowing I am not putting a bunch of chemicals on my head</li>
            <li> It breaks my hair and my customer&#x27;s hair even more now.</li>
            <li> Had the wonderful idea to get a perm and it totally fried my hair!  </li>
            <li> I love the way looked after using this conditioner.</li>
            <li> I love vanilla anyways</li>

            <li> SURE I DONT RUN OUT</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner.  </li>
            <li> but I was pleased with the results after using this conditioner once</li>
            <li> This conditioner is my favorite conditioner and my husband is hooked too.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I use the argan shampoo and silk 18 conditioner, I love the combination together.  </li>
            <li> I love the smell.</li>
            <li> My hair is the most manageable it has ever been and</li>
            <li> I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am very happy that I&#x27;ve finally found something that helps my hair look and feel healthier</li>
            <li> - my hair feels better after washing with thier Argan Oil Shampoo &amp; conditioning, and it&#x27;s prettier.  </li>
            <li> I must say my hair is definitely in better shape than when I began using it, but I also attribute that to a sunflower/castor oil mask I made at home.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to love you.</li>
            <li> This product seems to help my hair be shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li> Silk 18 is better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve since been trying different ways to bring out my best curl.</li>
            <li> I love that if I am just bumming around I do not have to put any product in my hair.</li>
            <li> I decided to try Silk 18 and love the softness and luscious vanilla scent it gives my hair.  </li>
            <li> If they had it in another scent this product would deserve more than 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to use much of Silk 18 to get great results.</li>
            <li> My hair has never felt better.</li>
            <li> And it smells fantastic!</li>
            <li> I will continue to buy Silk18, I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> Now it is much better.  </li>
            <li> Love the smell and texture.</li>
            <li> It has more shine and body, and it feels thicker.  </li>
            <li> I knew there had to be a better solution.</li>
            <li> I love the smell.</li>
            <li> Which is still better than oily.  </li>
            <li> Hair is silky smooth!</li>
            <li> Sulfate free!</li>
            <li> and Love the smell.</li>
            <li> Thank you :)</li>
            <li> But I think it&#x27;s better than most.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use both the Maple Holistics shampoo and their Silk 18 conditioner and have never found anything that leaves my hair in better condition.  </li>
            <li> I was actually able to get a comb through my hair after I got out of the shower which is a miracle.  </li>
            <li> It makes my curly hair SO much more manageable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it all summer and love it.</li>
            <li> My hair feels more silky and hydrated after i started using it</li>
            <li> I am extremely satisfied with my purchase and will be buying this one again.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the last 2 weeks Very HAPPY with the results and would recommend it to both men &amp; women</li>
            <li> Bed head is better</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner.  </li>
            <li> This has added more moisture to my hair.  </li>
            <li> I wish that more companies would pay attention to their business model!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this product it changed my hair&lt;</li>
            <li> I have had many complements on my hair now.&lt;br /&gt;Comb</li>
            <li> I ordered this conditioner along with their argan oil shampoo and the two of them together are a winning combination.</li>
            <li> but it was much more manageable and healthy looking.</li>
            <li> Trying to be more of organic in the cosmetic department too.</li>
            <li> And the conditioner made it smell like magic.</li>
            <li> I will probably buy more.</li>
            <li> It may be better if it was on a box like those they put body scrubs.</li>
            <li> I love the way this conditioner smells and feels on my hair and beard.</li>
            <li> Love the smell, love the product...</li>
            <li> I love the smell of it.</li>
            <li> Smells great and works really well.</li>
            <li> The smell of this conditioner makes its purchase worthwhile.</li>
            <li> That makes my hunt all the more challenging.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner.</li>
            <li> I like the conditioner better than the shampoo.</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> With all that said, I will continue to use these products as they are still better than what&#x27;s offered in salons.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> I tried many conditioners.</li>
            <li> It said hint of Vanilla, but I am not so sure about that.</li>
            <li> All my reviews and star rating on the items are truthful and unbiased.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this conditioner.</li>
            <li> Overall, it is a good buy!!</li>
            <li> I have never used a better conditioner.</li>
            <li> Fantastic!  </li>
            <li> The conditioner itself may be okay.</li>
            <li> If you like everyone to be able to smell you when you walk into room then you&#x27;ll probably love this. .</li>
            <li> Now that I have been using Silk 18 for a while (on my third bottle), I can now say that it is the best conditioner I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through one bottle of this product, and still love it.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stop touching it.</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE the feeling i get after using the conditioner.</li>
            <li> It had synthetic fragrance, and even more of my hair fell out, my scalp started to peel, and it was inflamed.</li>
            <li> Please keep the prices low, as this is the best conditioner (and shampoo)</li>
            <li> Not only is it affordable, it&#x27;s a great product!</li>
            <li> Love the smell and quality.</li>
            <li> more I use this conditioner,  the more I love it.</li>
            <li> conditioner that would make my frizzy, out-of control hair be somewhat more manageable, and it did...</li>
            <li> Check out the answer in the Q&amp;A section about ingredients and be sure to expand it (I didn&#x27;t before my purchase, which was a mistake).</li>
            <li> Yeah it makes your hair more manageable, because it strips it.</li>
            <li> it was more manageable BUT there are risks it seems.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d love if there were more in the bottle,</li>
            <li> i can&#x27;t wait to see how much better my hair gets with continued use</li>
            <li> I love the smell also.</li>
            <li> i have been using this and the Argan shampoo and love both.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thrilled that it&#x27;s sulfate free because I know it won&#x27;t compromise my hair coloring.  </li>
            <li> It was bouncy and held the curl better than ever before.  </li>

            <li> But, then I moved on to Silk18 that so many reviewers were speaking of.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also glad to know the ingredients are all natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought it because I read all the wonderful reviews, but I didn&#x27;t get the same results.</li>
            <li> My favorite conditioner.</li>
            <li> but, after using this conditioner just once my hair feels a million times better</li>
            <li> He told me he would send me another shampoo which would work better for me.  </li>
            <li> I love the product.</li>
            <li> Just purchased my 2nd bottle!This has to be the best conditioner I have used in my life.</li>

            <li> The price was an ok cost for the size of the bottle.  </li>
            <li> I love this conditioner.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for about two weeks now, and am glad I purchased it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just be sure to rinse hair well to get all of the conditioner out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I was so pleased I decided to let them know</li>

            <li> I love this and will be purchasing more of it as I run out of it.</li>
            <li> The conditioner was just okay.</li>
            <li> Maybe this is why so many in this sustainable community have dreadlocks..</li>
            <li> This is probably my favorite conditioner.</li>
            <li> I found this conditioner while I was searching for top rated ones, and I am glad I did.</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner.</li>
            <li> Most products either don&#x27;t work or make my hair feel greasy.  </li>
            <li> I doubt this is an issue for most people, but I had to give my bottle away.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff :)</li>
            <li> What a lovely product.</li>
            <li> I have been doing my research on hair care products that are healthy for me, the earth and my family.</li>
            <li> we all love the way it smells and conditions our hair.</li>
            <li> I got this product mostly for my mom because I wanted us to start trying some organic products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much more fuller</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not oily at the top anymore.</li>
            <li> I finally have what I want and deserve, a healthy scalp and beautiful hair!</li>
            <li> Will be buying more of their products for sure.</li>
            <li> I wanted to help and went to my favorite source - Amazon.  </li>
            <li> He picked it up only a week or so ago, and texted this morning &amp;#34;That dandruff conditioner is awesome!</li>
            <li> It has been around a week of using the conditioner and my hair has noticeably became so much more healthy.</li>
            <li> The ingredients are safe and well thought out.  </li>
            <li> really love this product.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m impressed w/</li>
            <li> This is simply the best conditioner I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve noticed that my hear maintains better elasticity and looks shinier.</li>
            <li> Oh well it still beats pantene pro-v any day:)</li>
            <li> I have used both conditioners with the Argan shampoo by Maple Holistics, and have reordered all three products again so I can decide what seems to work better after using them a bit longer.</li>
            <li> It felt like magic in my hair.</li>
            <li> and I have to use more than suggested during a conditioning session.</li>
            <li> I am in love .</li>
            <li> FABULOUS!</li>
            <li> I LOVE the smell too:)</li>
            <li> I love the smell, too.  </li>
            <li> The conditioner smells great, and really softens my hair.</li>
            <li> , my hair looked better than when I used either of them by themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Cant say how much i love this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in Love.</li>
            <li> AND I seriously LOVE his product.</li>
            <li> BEST OF all--it&#x27;s all NATURAL, paraben free.</li>
            <li> I tried this on a whim after reading so many reviews.</li>
            <li> it really reduced frizz, still have great body, got a comb thru it like silk</li>
            <li> im sure</li>
            <li> I just ordered two bottles and also ordered  the argan oil shampoo, not even going to bother with a sample that&#x27;s how confidant I am that I will love it.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product and will continue to use it for many years to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really love this conditioner.</li>
            <li> Every time I use this I think it smells like root beer and to me, that is ok</li>
            <li> I tried silk conditioner and fell in love.</li>
            <li> In desperation I&#x27;ve switched to no sulfate/silicone free shampoos and conditioners and have even resorted to making my own.</li>
            <li> Best of all is how my hair feels - soft, smooth and hydrated.  </li>
            <li> My friend, knowing how much I love all-natural conditioners, bought this for my birthday.</li>
            <li> After reading reviews about people who have used this product as a deep conditioner, I decided to try leaving it in my hair longer, and the results were great!</li>
            <li> I really love this conditioner.</li>
            <li> I love knowing it&#x27;s organic and better for my hair.</li>
            <li> and i have to say I love it</li>
            <li> the smell is also refreshing with vanilla undertone.</li>
            <li> Great product and the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li> I bought the shampoo and despite reading that if you have oily hair you should not condition I am glad that I decided to get the conditioner anyway.  </li>
            <li> It gives my hair a light silky feel after washing it and a nice woody vanilla smell that smells yummy and not overpowering.  </li>
            <li> I really enjoyed the smell and how it took out all the tangles out of my hair.</li>
            <li> I will be trying the shampoo next because I am happy with this product!</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner.</li>
            <li> and I love the vanilla scent.</li>
            <li> Many conditioners say use a quarter size amount - this means it.</li>
            <li> Fantastic conditioner!  </li>
            <li> I am really pleased and will order again.</li>
            <li> This conditioner seems to have the perfect combination of enough moisturizing without adding weight.  </li>
            <li> Really enjoyed this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not kidding, I keep touching it because I can&#x27;t believe it myself.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this conditioner.  </li>
            <li> and I can still able to smell the yumminess after hours</li>
            <li> my hair looks healthy..</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair incredible silky smooth and smells wonderful (though subtle) - like creamy shea butter.</li>
            <li> Has a very nice vanilla scent but it didn&#x27;t do much for my hair.  </li>
            <li> It also smells wonderful like natural vanilla beans and rinses clean.</li>
            <li> It is full, shiny, and healthy!</li>
            <li> I just tried the shampoo and conditioner, so far so good!</li>
            <li> So far so good!  </li>
            <li> The vanilla dominance is too clean and nice.</li>
            <li> Jus soft beautiful hair :)</li>
            <li> Smells pretty good, I wish there was more information on the bottle though, I like to read while im in the shower</li>
            <li> THIS product, however is all natural and so healthy for your hair and for our beautiful planet.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure at first if I would like it, but based on all the good reviews I took a chance</li>
            <li> Smells great very natural as wonderful ingredients however for my bleach blonde hair</li>
            <li> great product, highly recommended for brittle hair.</li>
            <li> It reminds me of the conditioner that comes with hair dye box sets, super silky and potent, does everything I could have hoped for, and no break out!</li>
            <li> Has nice smell but nothing special.</li>
            <li> But it is a nice conditioner, just nothing special.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair look great and soft!!</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair super soft and smelling wonderful!</li>
            <li> It has a light fragrance smell that is pleasant and fresh</li>
            <li> I ran across this item by recommendation on a blog I frequently visit &amp; was super impressed.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is super soft, I can&#x27;t stop touching my hair!!!!</li>
            <li> Works great but lingering vanilla scent really is  too strong.</li>
            <li> The shampoo doesn&#x27;t tingle, still my scalp and hair is very clean.  </li>
            <li> love feeling good about putting good products on my hair, and I feel even better supporting a company that cares about their customers as much as Maple Holistics does.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a sweet smell to it, kind of like vanilla or honey.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The first  is for its good smelling.</li>
            <li> This conditioner has been the best for us long haired girls (ages 5, 9 and 39).  </li>
            <li> This is the best conditioner that I have used in a long time.  </li>
            <li> On my first use it was good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m impressed, and will continue to use this conditioner for as long as I can.</li>
            <li> This conditioner feels good at first, but after 8-12 hours, my hair starts to look and feel greasy.</li>
            <li> I want though, because my hair looks pretty good coming out of the salon -</li>
            <li> however it was pretty darn good.</li>
            <li> Still makes my hair soft and beautiful.</li>
            <li> In first use my hair felt so good.</li>

            <li> When I applied the shampoo is was light weight but did the job of making my scalp feel clean and hydrated, a refreshing feeling, and very easy to rinse out.</li>
            <li> Good stuff if you like the smell of vanilla (which I certainly do).</li>

            <li> I have a tendency to test the conditioner because it is more important to me than what shampoo I use.</li>

            <li> My hair is now free, no loss, feels and looks healthy.</li>
            <li> After reading about this product and all the greatness it has to offer (natural ingredients that i can pronounce, no animal testing, and all the great reviews, etc.)</li>
            <li> This is fantastic for hair to absorb the most.</li>
            <li> Everything about it screams natural ingredients and my hair feels great afterwards.</li>
            <li> This is a great product so far.  </li>

            <li> Great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> ingredients are natural and it lends to the outdoorsy smell with vanilla undertones that smells great all day.</li>
            <li> This conditioner smells amazing, Im pretty sure I&#x27;ve found my shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li> The smell was great, but hardly natural.</li>
            <li> the top 3 selling points of this conditioner are that it&#x27;s sulfate free, not tested on animals</li>
            <li> It makes my hair soft and shiny, and adds slip for great combability.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair smooth and I love the smell.</li>

            <li> We are a very holistic family and we have never found a holistic hair conditioner that is as good as this one.</li>
            <li> I loved Maple Holistics product so much, i still have some frizz on the ends</li>
            <li> Thanks to all and good</li>
            <li> It has been a long process and I have come across some good and some not so good products.  </li>
            <li> The product as a whole was definitely a good purchase.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful, makes your hair look and feel healthy without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> I have been meaning to write this review for a while because I rarely find a product for my fine hair that I truly LOVE!  </li>
            <li> Whatever they use is something special!  </li>
            <li> In the meantime I guess I&#x27;ll use it on special occasions!</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair tangle free, smooth, soft and it smells really good!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a miracle in it&#x27;s own right.</li>
            <li> it leaves my hair so soft and smooth!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of treatments for my hair, and probably most of the brands out there, by far this is the best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever tried, it leaves my hair incredibly soft and looking healthy.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice conditioner that leaves my hair feeling soft but manageable.  </li>
            <li> My hair feels soft and looks very nice.</li>
            <li> am nearing 60 with bra strap length, super fine hair which tangles very easily.</li>
            <li> The shampoo lathers up very nicely and has a nice scent to it, but after rinsing my hair it felt dry and brittle.  </li>
            <li> This conditioner not only managed to do that, but it also smells so good!</li>
            <li> I wash my hair because I feel it necessary, but it still looks just as good on day 3 as it does on day 1!</li>
            <li> It makes my hair softer than if I didn&#x27;t use it, but it&#x27;s not the best conditioner out there, despite other rave reviews.</li>
            <li> This conditioner has those stats, and a wonderful creamy texture that seemed to absorb into the hair quicker than other products i have tried.  </li>
            <li> Other than that it was wonderful.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s full luster!</li>
            <li> I think it does a great job of pretty much eliminating static electricity in my hair.</li>
            <li> After doing some research on other recommended products, I decided to try this one since it was on sale and had awesome reviews.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this on all hair types and I am excited to try more of their products.</li>
            <li> Not a bad product, great shipping, nice vanilla scent, but kind of watery and certainly not super moisturizing or a detangler.</li>
            <li> It is light weight, smells great and makes my hair feel soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair perfect so soft, and real moisture.  </li>
            <li> So far very happy with my purchase - the product was packaged very well and no leakage in transport.  </li>
            <li> 5 stars, easy.</li>
            <li> Overall, I feel that this is an excellent product worth trying.</li>
            <li> My hair breaks and splits easy.  </li>
            <li> Affordable, effective, and organic...can&#x27;t really get much better than that.&lt;br /&gt;Leave</li>
            <li> and it would break easily.  </li>
            <li> Silk 18 distributed evenly and rinsed out easily.</li>
            <li> in three days, my scalp was clean and flake free!  </li>
            <li> The shampoo lathered well and rinsed away easily</li>
            <li> so it dries out easily.  </li>
            <li> I can comb my hair easily when I get out of the shower.</li>
            <li> but I like to be more squeaky clean when I rinse off so 4/5 stars from me.</li>
            <li> Combs out easily and feels hydrated.</li>
            <li> Smells great, but more importantly, definitely leaves my hair feeling softer/smoother and looking a bit &#x27;brighter&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Her hair brushes out so easily after bath time.</li>
            <li> So far I am loving this conditioner and hope it will continue to give me amazing results.</li>
            <li> The conditioner worked well and was easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my hair, shiny and bouncy and easy to style.</li>
            <li> The package was easy to open.&lt;br /&gt;PS-</li>
            <li> Smells great, doesn&#x27;t leave residue, controls frizz quite a bit and leaves hair soft and tangle free.</li>
            <li> When you get the perfect amount for you, it really makes your hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It leaves my hair soft, manageable, and smelling great!&lt;br /&gt;Customer service at Maple Holistics is awesome - very helpful.</li>
            <li> This conditioner reduces the volume of my hair and make it easy to handle my hair even when it&#x27;s raining.</li>
            <li> The design and the hardness of the plastic of the bottle prevents customers from easily squeezing the conditioner out.  </li>
            <li> Easily de-tangles my always tangling hair</li>
            <li> The smell is a bit strong but dissipates after about 6 hours.  </li>
            <li> Smell was way too strong for me</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s spring; I&#x27;m allergic, period), the vanilla fragrance is way too strong.  </li>
            <li> The scent is strong in the shower-</li>
            <li> so it was too strong for me.</li>
            <li> The shampoo has a strong medicinal smell, and I&#x27;m telling you this because this Silk 18 conditioner has a strong, masking vanilla scent.</li>
            <li> consistency.&lt;br /&gt;- Strong vanilla scent.</li>
            <li> Plus it&#x27;s a safe and natural product I feel good about using.</li>
            <li> I love how smooth my hair feels and so clean, and most importantly my hair no longer tangles into knots the day after I shampoo.</li>
            <li> So far so good :)</li>
            <li> I love that there are no harsh chemicals and that it is truly all ingredients that are good.</li>
            <li> The scent is not too strong which I also like.  </li>
            <li> natural ingredients, smells good, and leaves my hair siky smooth!</li>
            <li> The scent is a strong vanilla type smell.</li>
            <li> It was too strong for me.</li>
            <li> I agree with some reviewers that the fragrance is a bit strong while standing in the shower, but I don&#x27;t notice it anymore after rinsing and drying.  </li>
            <li> I can understand why some reviewers say the scent is strong</li>
            <li> smell is not too strong.</li>
            <li> Not too strong for me.</li>
            <li> I disagree with others that say it smells too strong.</li>
            <li> It is far superior to chemically based salon brands - most of which contain damaging silicone ingredients.</li>
            <li> Scent is way to strong for my taste.</li>
            <li> Love this product .It makes my hair very silky ..and really nice smell.</li>
            <li> It smelled of vanilla, but was not too strong for my liking.</li>
            <li> Just okay, nothing special.</li>
            <li> This conditioner first and foremost smells amazing.</li>
            <li> My hair is so soft after using and the smell is amazing!</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this product and am looking forward to seeing how much it will continue to help my hair with repeated use.</li>
            <li> It is NATURAL, NO ANIMAL TESTING, and it  WORKS AMAZINGLY!</li>
            <li> Out of all of the safe and natural conditioners I have tried, it is the best I have found so far.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best and most natural creme rinse for any hair type.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for shampoo/conditioner that I can feel good about as my family moves towards a more natural and chemical free lifestyle.  </li>
            <li> First off, it smells amazing.</li>
            <li> I Love this Product so much that I only use it when I want my hair to look its best!</li>
            <li> My hair is more shiny and full than ever.  </li>
            <li> straightening- the curls underneath formed thick, perfect ringlets and looked even better than my top layer...</li>
            <li> Love the softness, no tangles, no buildup so my hair stays full.</li>
            <li> It is much better than those store bought brands as they are full of toxins.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> even the smell of is pretty nice.</li>
            <li> At first, I bought a cheaper conditioner, and though that helped, I wasn&#x27;t thrilled about some of the ingredients (and lack of others).</li>
            <li> this conditioner leaves my hair soft and shiny and the smell is so nice!</li>
            <li> Liked it for about the first week...</li>
            <li> I have tried many natural conditioners and this is by far the best yet!</li>
            <li> but they&#x27;ve managed to make it actually pretty nice.  </li>
            <li> It is much better than those store bought brands as they are full of chemicals.</li>
            <li> Would love to try it in combination with a matching shampoo or conditioning cleanser to get the full effect.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-- Full of potent ingredients for hair health like Silk Amino Acids, Argan, Jojoba, and Keratin&lt;br /&gt;--</li>
            <li> I love that it does not weigh your hair down and it leaves a very pleasant light vanilla scent.</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best conditioner i have ever used.</li>
            <li> It does wonders but doesn&#x27;t weigh down hair, a great product!</li>
            <li> This is hands down the BEST conditioner I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Hands down, THE best conditioner I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> Hands down the best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> This is hands down the BEST conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> Hands down the best conditioner I have used!</li>
            <li> Hands down, this is the best conditioner I have ever used!</li>
            <li> Hands down the BEST non-greasy, no residue, detangling conditioner ever!!!!  </li>
            <li> My hair is soft and shiny and the smell is pleasant, even though vanilla is not an awesome scent choice, it is not worth lowering the rating.  </li>
            <li> The smell is great- not too much vanilla, but very warm and full-bodied.</li>
            <li> I was excited about a more natural, made in America product that sounded so good for my hair.</li>
            <li> With this conditioner, my hair feels smooth and it is easy to style.</li>
            <li> I have extremely fine hair</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s sulfate free and my hair is so full of shine.</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length fine, wavy, oily hair.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair soft and smooth and it smells amazing!</li>
            <li> I have fine hair</li>
            <li> My hair is a mix of fine</li>
            <li> If you have fine hair, like my daughter does, you will want to use just a touch and not overdo it.</li>
            <li> (if you have fine hair, you understand why this matters, can&#x27;t tug through like heartier tresses.)</li>
            <li> Just the thought that it has helped keep it conditioned and healthy for the past 2 months is wonderful.  </li>
            <li> the only one that really leaves my hair shiny - Jason&#x27;s Biotin Shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After washing it, I have been doing a &amp;#34;conditioner-experiment&amp;#34;, and while most of the results were good, the results I got using the Silk 18 Natural Conditioner by Maple Holistics, were great!</li>
            <li> I have fine straighter hair</li>
            <li> The shampoo is fine, nothing to write home about, but the conditioner is fabulous.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> I have fine, oily hair; I bought the Maple Holistics Degrease shampoo and this conditioner.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo bottle was fine, though.</li>

            <li> She suggested a sulfate free product.</li>
            <li> and why they sent me a free product of my choosing.</li>
            <li> I received a free bottle of Argon oil conditioner, which I just love.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have always bought cheap shampoos from the pharmacy</li>
            <li> and it took time to recover my smooth hair.</li>
            <li> chemical filled conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have been using this conditioner for a few weeks, and it’s literally the best conditioner I’ve ever used (and believe me…</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so tangle free.</li>
            <li> Company seems genuinely invested in their product.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is just fantastic...</li>
            <li> It makes my hair smooth and light and shiny.</li>
            <li> It would be great if this came in a bigger bottle - 1 bottle</li>
            <li> I am happy with the ingredients, which I can pronounce and with the way it left my hair feeling and smelling!</li>
            <li> I like that they are sulfate free.  </li>
            <li> swingy and these products fit the bill.  </li>
            <li> The product can be applied to the hair so smoothly.</li>
            <li> My fingers don&#x27;t run through my hair as smoothly as they did.</li>
            <li> Fantastic conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I noticed the smell, it&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li> The product was packaged nicely and I would highly recommend ordering it!</li>
            <li> I run it through with my fingers and in seconds all the knots are gone and my hair feels silky smooth.</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a light vanilla-ish smell.  </li>
            <li> It was like I&#x27;d covered myself in a cheap body spray from the mall.  </li>
            <li> it still turns out sleek &amp; smooth.  </li>
            <li> If you have a sensitivity to fragrance or just find the smell of many products aggressively perfumey then this one is certainly worth a try.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> I need a light conditioner</li>
            <li> It makes my hair silky and smooth without making it oily</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t sleep on Silk, you will be missing out on a wonderful product!!</li>
            <li> It leaves hair shiny, smooth and manageable</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> This conditioner if fantastic.  </li>
            <li> He sent me the Sage Shampoo FREE OF COST -</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s great to have something that can repair such damage i&#x27;ve done.</li>
            <li> My hair was silky smooth.</li>
            <li> I also like that it is a sulfate free product.  </li>
            <li> Free Shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li> I tried the argan sulfate free shampoo because it was the number one shampoo recommended on amazon.</li>
            <li> the Silk conditioner does a fantastic job of detangling.</li>
            <li> If you are used to creamy conditioners that detangle your hair be prepared to adjust to a sulfate - free experience.</li>
            <li> It does the job, leaving my hair silky smooth</li>
            <li> but perhaps there should be an economy size available too.</li>
            <li> this stuff is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> Iove that it is sulfate free.</li>
            <li> I sprayed it on my hair and left it as a leave in conditioner and works great.</li>
            <li> It is light and organic.</li>
            <li> So happy that I finally found something</li>
            <li> However, over the summer, I switched to a sulfate free shampoo and began putting coconut oil in my hair.</li>
            <li> It smells like it says a light vanilla scent it is yummyyyy.</li>
            <li> I used this product for a deep conditioner and it works great on my hair.</li>
            <li> It smells fantastic and makes my hair silky smooth.</li>
            <li> Someone mentioned in a review that you can get a free sample to try from the company, so that&#x27;s what I did.  </li>
            <li> won&#x27;t be asking for the free product because I don&#x27;t need whatever they want to give me.  </li>
            <li> This is a great product that I will continue to use on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> I am so happy with this shampoo I will definitely continue using it, my hair is softer and shinier that it ever has been.</li>

            <li> This is a lot like Wen leaving your hair smooth and without frizz.  </li>
            <li> This is such a great product...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing, really.  </li>
            <li> I think this would make for a great deep conditioner.</li>
            <li> My hair is now silky smooth.</li>
            <li> Huge plus that it&#x27;s a sulfate free</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair silky smooth.</li>
            <li> Maple Holistics seems like such a great company, and they will help you with anything and answer questions that you might have.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair smooth.</li>
            <li> received this product as a free sample from Maple Holistics, but I will be buying again and again.</li>
            <li> i have frizzy-ish hair and this made it really smooth and easier to work with</li>
            <li> Thank you Maple Holistics for such a great product.</li>
            <li> and it makes my hair feel so smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> I also use the argan shampoo (fantastic).</li>
            <li> My hair feels lightweight and is frizz free, while my curls stay light and bouncy.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, I found my brand and my products:</li>
            <li> I am so thankful to have such a great product.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair fairly smooth and silky.  </li>
            <li> I also ride along on our motorcycles and drive the convertible and let my hair blow freely in the wind.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t hesitate get your free sample.</li>
            <li> but this made it silk and smooth.</li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner I got from you guys healed my scalp in about 2 or 3 washes and I like that the smell of each is a light citrus/vanilla ish sent.</li>
            <li> I tried tea tree shampoo and that makes my scalp tingle and feel clean but its scent is too strong.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s fantastic.  </li>
            <li> That was 15 hours of light vanilla scented hair.</li>
            <li> and my hair is silky smooth.  </li>
            <li> My hair was so silky smooth</li>
            <li> Sulfate free</li>
            <li> While conditioning you smell a nice really mellow vanilla fragrance, and after rinse-out, no fragrance lingers&lt;br /&gt;--</li>
            <li> Fantastic...</li>
            <li> I was searching for a reall good conditioner that didn&#x27;t take the volume away and at the same time gave my hair the moisture it needs to feel healthy and bouncy and shiny.</li>
            <li> Thank you amazon-much appreciated for such a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> So far, so good after using it for a day.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> Needed a good, natural conditioner for my color-treated hair.</li>
            <li> This natural conditioner was recommended by my good friend working in a health department.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;ve finally found a conditioner which is good for my hair.  </li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> I have used better at a better price (try Aussie&#x27;s 3 Minute Miracle, $2.99, for that price it really is a miracle).</li>
            <li> Both young ladies were delighted with the results, so I ordered a bottle for myself.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good natural product.</li>
            <li> It smells good and keeps your hair feeling soft and lightweight</li>
            <li> It made her hair so soft and smell so good after one use.  </li>
            <li> I tried on my daughters natural hair and it worked good (no medicine like smell there).</li>
            <li> This is one of a good conditioner I have used so far.</li>
            <li> I will update this if anything changes but so far so good.</li>
            <li> I love this, and have found a cruelty-free, American-made hair product that I can&#x27;t say enough good things about.</li>
            <li> It smells so good &amp; leaves my hair so soft &amp; shiny.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this several times, just to be sure to give it a fair chance.</li>
            <li> Thanks Maple Holistic for such a wonderful product!</li>
            <li> In fact, I&#x27;ve found that since I started using this conditioner, my curls keep their shape for much longer, so now I&#x27;m able to avoid drying-out my scalp (and my curls) with too many washes in a week.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product for anyone looking for a good, all natural, conditioner.</li>
            <li> Wanted something natural for my hair and tried this, I loved it.</li>
            <li> It smells so good, like vanilla, and it leaves my hair ridiculously soft.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> Our hair is soft and feels so good after using, just what i was looking for.</li>
            <li> Smells good made my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> My experience includes many different shampoos and conditioners: some good, some not so.</li>
            <li> I feel good that it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li> I also am able to straighten my hair and style it way easier than normal and it looks healthier!!!</li>
            <li> I would really advise anyone to look through reviews by star ratings, don&#x27;t just go through the first couple of pages and see all 5 star ratings and think its a great product, most of these reviews were probably done positively to get the free product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine if you use a shampoo that&#x27;s rich.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a light warm vanilla smell that fades away pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> I’m a huge fan!&lt;br /&gt;I’m also very satisfied with the retailer Maple Holistics, they were extremely professional and speedy!  </li>
            <li> I tried a lot of different conditioners but this one leaft my hair smelling great and feeling fresh!</li>
            <li> The vanilla scent is alright too, sweet and not too strong.</li>
            <li> I also noticed that it grows much faster than ever before!!!</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m really really glad I found this product!!</li>
            <li> Will definitely be buying more of this product!!</li>
            <li> and it is now feeling silky again and has a very nice shine that recently someone commented about.  </li>
            <li> My hair feels super clean afterwards and even looks clean!</li>
            <li> At first I feel my hair became very smooth and silky after using it, then after about two weeks I found that my hair loss has been under coontrol, I used it with Argan Oil Shampoo, it seems to work well together.</li>
            <li> The scent was light and clean.</li>
            <li> I purchased along with the top selling natural shampoo with the best ratings on amazon and my hair is just as dry as before using the product.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair smooth and I am very sure my hair loves all the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> All natural, smells amazing, and leaves my hair super shiny, and healthy after just one use.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used a cruelty free product this good for my hair since ever because apparently, they haven&#x27;t been in production until now.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am very pleased with this conditioner :)</li>
            <li> I love how natural the ingredients are and how strong and healthy my hair feels now.</li>
            <li> I purchased the argan oil shampoo and silk 18 conditioner about a  month and a half ago and wanted to make sure to use it for a while before reviewing to make sure I had a good idea.  </li>
            <li> conditioner works great for me doesn&#x27;t irritate skin and makes my hair so soft i noticed difference after first use .smells</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t stand the super strong vanilla smell.  </li>
            <li> As for myself, without knowing that I started using a new conditioner, commented on how good my hair looked after just the first use!</li>
            <li> Not only does it have a light refreshing vanilla smell but even better is the results!</li>
            <li> Maple Holistics is one of my new favorite companies!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is my new favorite!</li>
            <li> This conditioner is really nice- or smells good, leaves my hair soft and shiny - I most definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I have tried MANY different natural &amp; organic conditioners that were ok, but nothing great-</li>
            <li> But overall I&#x27;m pretty much happy with this product because my hair is no longer full of static</li>
            <li> I am really loving this conditioner so far!!</li>
            <li> If you have dry or damaged hair or you have extensions and need a good conditioner, try this you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> Everyone&#x27;s hair was soft, smelled nice, and easily combed.</li>
            <li> Made my hair super soft and it smells really good.  </li>
            <li> the ingredient list is great, but i didn&#x27;t FEEL that my hair was ANY better at all, compared to typical conditioner.</li>
            <li> It truly made my hair very soft with great shine and very manageable.</li>
            <li> The only way to explain this conditioner is AMAZING!</li>
            <li> I style my hair with a hot air brush and it looks better then</li>
            <li> Even after one conditioner use I noticed a significant difference.</li>
            <li> Just that first use alone has given a lot of healthy characteristics to my longer hairstyle.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this conditioner, along with the argon oil shampoo for one of my guest bathrooms.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the conditioner, however, for me I feel like I need a shampoo to pair it with in order to gain the full benefits of the product.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;d have to say that I&#x27;m very satisfied with Maple Holistics Silk 18.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Believe me when i say that from the first use itself my hair started to feel and look way way better.</li>
            <li> It smells Vanilla for the first 15-20 minutes, nothing over the top.</li>
            <li> First of all, I LOVE the smell of this product.  </li>
            <li> I love it and will go back for more!</li>
            <li> I started using this on my daughter hair, along with a wet brush, and it brushes through beautifully.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a funny problem to have :))</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li> So fresh!</li>
            <li> THE FIRST PRODUCT OUT OF MANY</li>
            <li> The minute I received the silk18 conditioner by Maple Holistics I immediately ran to wash my hair because I was so excited to try it out.</li>
            <li> Some products I tried work at first, then after a while, the magic disappears.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m originally from Australia).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I also like the fresh fragrance!  </li>
            <li> I would be willing to pay more for a &amp;#34;value&amp;#34; size.</li>
            <li> Most on the first use.</li>
            <li> I also love the price, it makes it very affordable!</li>
            <li> I am not disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I was SO excited to find a a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I have tried many conditioners and this is the first conditioner that seems to keep my hair under control.</li>
            <li> I have since purchased 3 more bottles of Silk after I first used this one.</li>
            <li> Giving 4 out of 5 because of my unique hair type.</li>
            <li> so I am beyond excited to keep using it</li>
            <li> Works great on my long hair.</li>
            <li> My hair feels softer, silkier, and very healthy with a natural shine.  </li>
            <li> After two uses, I can say that my hair feels significantly softer.</li>
            <li> And almost as importantly, this is a reasonably priced product available on Prime :)</li>
            <li> I am excited about this conditioner--it seems to suit my hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair was noticeably softer after the first time I used it, and it is getting better with each use.  </li>
            <li> the tangles are gone, it is manageable, no more than just a couple strands fell out in the shower, it feels moisturized, and best of all, it flows!  </li>
            <li> Love it and love the fact that it&#x27;s all natural ingredients!</li>
            <li> When it came I was excited and scared to try it.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product, by far my favorite of the MANY I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m interested in a conditoner that is safe for me and the environment.  </li>
            <li> It is well worth the price!</li>
            <li> I have really enjoyed my first purchase of Silk 18 conditioner, in conjunction  with the Maple Holistics Argan Oil Shampoo.</li>
            <li> My hair started shedding like it had when I used to use store-bought conditioners (not clumps or anything, but fairly significant).</li>
            <li> she was so excited she  immediately gave me the  conditioner, Silk 18 for me to try.  </li>
            <li> I was searching for a good, daily conditioner for my fine hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably a good product for certain hair types but didn&#x27;t do much for my curly course hair.</li>
            <li> Even while I was still in the shower I noticed that my hair felt great and was super soft after the first use.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to those who want natural and beautiful hair without harmful ingredients.</li>
            <li> i was very excited to use it for the first time.</li>
            <li> I love the rich vanilla scent of this conditioner, and my dry, frizzy hair is much more soft, manageable and looks great and moisturized.</li>
            <li> Great conditioner to help with dry flakes.</li>
            <li> The product is super silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> It was amazing, it likes Jesus came to bless my hair, it was better to style and definitely healthier.</li>
            <li> Great conditioner for my thin,frizzy and dry damaged hair.  </li>
            <li> my hair is too dry, its works great for me..</li>
            <li> This product left my hair soft and smelling great!</li>
            <li> No dandruff, scalp feels clean and not itchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con</li>
            <li> More importantly, my soft, shiny and smooth locks have lingered too!</li>
            <li> I have used a lot of different types of conditioner and this is honestly among the top.</li>
            <li> clean</li>
            <li> but with this conditioner after I rinsed once my hands felt clean.  </li>
            <li> So far I am impressed with Silkyness of hair and overall results.</li>
            <li> After shampooing, I use the Silk 18 Conditioner; and my hair feels so clean afterward.  </li>
            <li> Never have I ever used something so clean and dominant before in my life.</li>
            <li> I love that the shampoo makes my hair soft and healthy feeling</li>
            <li> and it feels so clean.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t fruity, but more of a coconut scent nice enough for any man.</li>
            <li> You couldn&#x27;t even run your fingers through it happily when it was DRY.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff my hairs so soft and has  reduced the look of damage in my hair :)</li>
            <li> Feels super smooth.</li>
            <li> It is rare for me to find something that i am satisfied with and this is one of those rare times.</li>
            <li> Just started using this product recently with a DHT blocking shampoo, and I&#x27;m very impressed so far.</li>
            <li> It rinses cleanly and I don&#x27;t feel any residue.  </li>
            <li> I love that this product has so many natural oils and ingredients.  </li>
            <li> It would be good if bigger size is available.</li>
            <li> Got a chance to use this recently and for those with natural hair its great for the winter!</li>
            <li> I wanted to try a product that was more natural and better for my hair.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a lot like Lorde&#x27;s (the singer) on day one, then day two and three, after a quick combing, gives it smooth, rolling waves.</li>
            <li> This has been working great so far, and i would really like to try out a shampoo to go with our conditioner.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it so far, bought 4 more bottles.</li>
            <li> Even though I eat clean, use organic hair products</li>
            <li> Because the shampoo seems to strip the hair clean, I recommend using the conditioner also.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many conditioners and this one is near the top.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair feeling silky, yet it still feels clean.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s rebounding, and when I use this combination it leaves my hair clean, but not stripped, shiny,</li>
            <li> ;  (also at Amazon) with Biotin, Coconut Oil, and Procapil to do an amazing job of getting the hair healthy enough to eliminate hair breakage and hair fall-out in about a month.</li>
            <li> It smells good, leaves hair soft, silky, and fresh.  </li>
            <li> It smells good, leaves hair soft, silky, and fresh.</li>
            <li> This made my hair very soft and smells nice.</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading many positive reviews but it does not perform that well.</li>
            <li> I was thinking about how many positive reviews this product received.  </li>
            <li> I have so many positive things to say about this conditioner I don&#x27;t know where to start.</li>
            <li> My hair smells amazing and the components are all natural!</li>
            <li> Wow!  Amazing Shampoo and Conditioner.  </li>
            <li> this is beyond the best product I have used other than my other shampoos and conditioners and none of them are good</li>
            <li> I love that this product was !00% natural.</li>
            <li> Soft healthy silky hair!  </li>
            <li> THIS conditioner by Maple Holistics is by far my favorite!</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite Conditioner!  </li>
            <li> I have two daughters, one with super fine hair and one with super curly hair.  </li>
            <li> Your fingers slide right through easily</li>
            <li> This conditioner smell wonderful and left my 4b/4c hair super soft.</li>
            <li> It left my hair super soft and the shine is incredible!</li>
            <li> I keep touching it and other people have commented on how good it looks.  </li>
            <li> I originally bought the Argan Shampoo without the conditioner and found it to be very drying and static inducing.  </li>
            <li> I had tried so many brands but all of them regardless of how pure the ingredients were still made my hair fall out when it came time to condition it.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t anything special for me.</li>
            <li> Nothing special..</li>
            <li> I used the Silk 18 conditioner after shampooing with argan special formula shampoo for two mornings in a row now.  </li>
            <li> Ordered another 2 bottles right away!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for the right conditioner that doesn&#x27;t irritate my eczema and this is the one!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not an overbearing smell, it&#x27;s just right!</li>
            <li> Very effective with extremely dry, curly hair.</li>
            <li> It smells aaaa-mazing and is also a great conditioner for very dry, curly hair.</li>
            <li> It has to leave my hair smooth feeling with a decent detangling and even better if it can help keep frizz at bay</li>
            <li> The vanilla smell is very pleasant, and it&#x27;s not very thick like most other conditioners, but not less effective.</li>
            <li> my fine hair still trying to get the right amount.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s natural vanilla scent is amazing &amp; not over powering to my nose, plus, it helps to cover the (offputting) scent of my shampoo.</li>
            <li> gives a balance to my hair, keeps soft and hydrate for days, and with a amazing smell.</li>
            <li> Product smells pretty good and leaves hair soft.</li>
            <li> I have now been using it for a few weeks and, while the difference isn&#x27;t quite as drastic as the first time I used it, it&#x27;s still the best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> This product is amazing and will continue using it as long as it&#x27;s available!</li>
            <li> This conditioner smells amazing and leaves hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair so soft and it smells amazing.</li>
            <li> And bonus points for it smelling like vanilla :)  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I love it and would absolutely recommend it for everyone</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been through a number of conditioners and I have only now found one that I feel good with.</li>
            <li> I have tried many many top line hair products and spent a fortune on them.  </li>
            <li> I have thick curly/wavy hair and this conditioner is one of the best that I have used.  </li>
            <li> I noticed the shampoo and conditioner leaves no residue as my hair looks good even the next morning,.</li>
            <li> Silk 18 leaves my curly wavy hair looking much thicker on top and shiny all over.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice soft and flowy.</li>
            <li> I thought that my hair would always be damaged because I did too much hair coloring, but thankfully I found this conditioner to restore it to better quality.  </li>
            <li> love this product very conditioning</li>
            <li> my hair felt so much softer and wasn&#x27;t as brittle as it was before :)</li>
            <li> This made my hair feel silky with a nice slip and soft.</li>
            <li> Using this for 3 weeks, my hair looks healthy and soft, so I&#x27;m never afraid of brushing my hair any more.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure how much to use though-</li>
            <li> Yes for Carrots actually leaves my hair softer than this which is surprising.  </li>
            <li> Really helps keep over processed (heat, color sprays) smooth and manageable!</li>
            <li> Some of the ingredients are synthetic, but there are some natural and even organically-based ingredients, as well, which is a nice change.  </li>
            <li> My hair is now so much softer and more manageable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sickeningly sweet.</li>
            <li> After shampooing, be sure you don&#x27;t wash out too much conditioner.</li>
            <li> I decided that I did not want any chemicals in my personal beauty regime and set out to find a good conditioner.</li>
            <li> That would be a dream come true.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good stuff about these products.  </li>
            <li> Company seems cool, too.</li>
            <li> Juat love the Silk 18th Conditioner it has helped my hair so much.</li>
            <li> my hair feels so much softer and i have noticed that i do not have as many split ends as before...</li>
            <li> yes its true</li>
            <li> Most of the times after washing my hair it tends to frizz fast.</li>
            <li> Additionally, it smells amazingly good that I want to  smell my hair day long :) as it is natural, I can safely use it and with ingredients</li>
            <li> My hair is full of body with no hampering residue.</li>
            <li> I recently had my hair highlighted for the first time and wanted to purchase a good moisturizing conditioner to keep my hair from becoming frizzy and damaged.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also good to use as a deep conditioner.</li>
            <li> It is also true that I may get a product for writing this review,  but, I can still review it any way I like.  </li>
            <li> The curls are more defined and my hair is so much softer.</li>
            <li> After towel drying my hair the true test came...</li>
            <li> and I found this conditioners had such a good reviews, so I got it.</li>
            <li> I do need a good shampoo as I only have the conditioner</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to use much, but be sure to leave it on 3-5 minutes.</li>
            <li> I love the lather of the argan shampoo and the fact it doesn&#x27;t have much scent.  </li>
            <li> A friend actually commented that my hair looked really good.</li>
            <li> I would definitely  purchase this again and it is affordable considering all the good ingredients in it.</li>
            <li> It helps to make my hair much softer and more manageable.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this conditioner more, but it really didn&#x27;t follow through with its promises.</li>
            <li> That seems like a more reasonable value to me.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know why people love this stuff</li>
            <li> Company made good on money back warranty.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this conditioner.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t stop using it it makes your hair soft and it smells really nice</li>
            <li> The kind you smell in a all natural shop.</li>
            <li> Love how truly &amp;#34;silky&amp;#34; this conditioner leaves my hair...without having to use much at all.  </li>
            <li> On one hand, it&#x27;s nice to know that I&#x27;m using a natural product on my hair.  </li>
            <li> i love it so much.</li>
            <li> I purchased this in 2014 of September and wanted to wait until today to see the full effects of the switch before I wrote my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> About 2 minutes on while in the shower and rinse out with cool water.</li>
            <li> It made my hair bouncy and full of life.</li>
            <li> My hair always feels nice and soft after my showers.</li>
            <li> made it feel nice a soft.</li>
            <li> Already, my hair has more body, shine and texture to it - and is looking like real hair - not frizzy-foam.  </li>
            <li> :) Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This morning, I woke up with straight, healthy-feeling and lightly scented hair!  </li>
            <li> A true conditioner.</li>
            <li> This conditioner really helped my hair, it is much better looking</li>
            <li> Love the product but feel that I have to use too much of it to get the desired effect.</li>
            <li> Absolute love</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews i wanted to try this conditioner and see if the reviews are true.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars though because it does make my hair nice and soft.</li>
            <li> Silk 18 leaves my hair feeling nice and soft.</li>
            <li> I personally used the conditioner and loved it.</li>
            <li> An absolute bargain - works much better than products that retail for 3 times the price.</li>
            <li> I rinse with cool water (makes</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t love this product as much as everyone else did.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Joking aside, I was looking for a really good conditioner to help with my roots, fraying split ends, and overall hair health.  </li>
            <li> Made my hair feel very silky and smooth too!</li>
            <li> She specifically did not use any styling product to see the true test between just shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> and i find myself having to use a bit of it as its a bit thick and doesn&#x27;t spread the best.</li>
            <li> I am always intrigued by products with so many 5 star reviews and then there are very polarized 1 star reviews.  </li>
            <li> After combing my tangled hair out I really had more split ends.  </li>
            <li> My hair really looks so healthy after applying a pea size amount.</li>
            <li> My hair looks almost as good as if i just left the salon.</li>
            <li> Despite that it works well and really does leave my hair feeling silky, my favorite part is the smell.</li>
            <li> The argan shampoo really smells like nothing which is ok.</li>
            <li> I had never heard of it before, but I liked that it was all natural.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my hair feeling soft and the curls in nice frizz-free ringlets.  </li>
            <li> They leave it in such good shape.</li>
            <li> my hair, so far it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li> I will be ordering this again and again and the price is not bad at all for this quality product.  </li>
            <li> it is like crack but for your hair and not bad for you...</li>
            <li> I started noticing the difference in just 2-3 days - the conditioner I was using before made my hair very dry; this one helps retain the moisture much better!!</li>
            <li> This conditioner really helps smooth, soften and tame and it smells great too!  </li>
            <li> This is my new conditioner, it leaves my hair smelling so lovely as well as smooth and not brittle.</li>
            <li> I will have to say after trying so many different organic and natural brands, I think this one is my most favorite!</li>
            <li> SO far best product for my dry scalp issues.</li>
            <li> This conditioner has a light, pleasant scent and works well--it leaves my dry hair feeling smooth and soft, and my wintertime static is under control.</li>
            <li> Smells incredible &amp; really helps with dry hair.</li>
            <li> Being honest like you said never used any of these products but by Reading the reviews I would love to try I have dry hair</li>
            <li> It smells amazing and leaves my hair super soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many conditioners in the past, but this one is the best that I&#x27;ve found by far!  </li>
            <li> this is raly a good product made my hair very soft and not too much falling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had them for 3 days and am so filled with joy that I FINALLY found a product that doesn&#x27;t leave my hair tacky or hard to brush, love the smell and truthfully, my very favorite is Silk 18.</li>
            <li> Overall the product itself is great, I can see why so many people have rated it highly and that is one of the reasons I decided to try it in the first place.</li>
            <li> Unlike various hair products, the Silk 18 is silicone free which is a huge thumbs up!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this conditioner along with the Hydrate shampoo for dry scalp and they have both been amazing!</li>
            <li> This is the best conditioner ever, I&#x27;m natural with super dry hair</li>
            <li> I was concerned at first, as my hair seemed knotty upon drying, but my comb glided easily through with no tugging.</li>
            <li> I have previously been using Beautiful Lengths conditioner</li>
            <li> that it has a pretty strong vanilla/sweet smell but others might like this</li>
            <li> It made de-tangling my hair pretty easy too.</li>
            <li> hair is left tangle free, shinny, and healthy!  </li>
            <li> I was so pleased with the Sage Shampoo that I was thrilled to learn about the companion Silk 18 conditioner and was willing for the first time in my adult life to buy a conditioner.</li>
            <li> Instead of feeling brittle, I&#x27;m enjoying how my hair feels soft, bouncy and healthy, even my old hair :)  </li>
            <li> It does a nice job of hydrating my curly hair and actually makes my curls soft and defined which is awesome especially in the humid months.</li>
            <li> Washes clean and got compliments on my hair the first time I used it!</li>
            <li> and I am going to try all of their other products too since my results have been great.</li>
            <li> I use this conditioner every day and my hair feels and looks great without a greasy texture like some other conditioners</li>
            <li> Other than that, it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> Other than that, this is a great product and would recommend.</li>
            <li> The smell lingers for a day or two, so even if I don&#x27;t wash my hair everyday, my hair still smells good!</li>
            <li> First impression when I was in the shower and put some in my hand: liked that it wasn&#x27;t runny and was a good thick consistency but still easily spreadable through my hair</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li> My hair feels light and healthy and super soft.</li>
            <li> Washing my hair with Silk 18 leaves it feeling clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> and my head felt totally fresh and clean</li>
            <li> I like the fresh clean scent .</li>
            <li> Super defined type 4 curls.</li>
            <li> used miss jessie&#x27;s super slip sudsy shampoo to start.</li>
            <li> Once the products came, I use them the night off and there was tremendous difference in softness and control.</li>
            <li> This conditioner moisturizes hair very well, and it makes for a great deep conditioner.</li>
            <li> Now I am even more pleased with Silk18, this stuff is such a life</li>
            <li> Now I am even more pleased with Silk18, this stuff is such a life saver!</li>
            <li> (but that&#x27;s prolly the shampoo) but works much better with my Pureology and now that I have faith I am definitely going to order the Argan Oil shampoo from Maple Holistics because I think it will work even better with that.</li>
            <li> I received my order quickly and upon use, immediately noticed a difference in my hair.  </li>
            <li> it has helped to prevent snarls and tangles tremendously.  </li>
            <li> I liked the conditioner, left hair feeling silky smooth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth noting I used this and the shampoo together twice and this by itself with Shea Moisture shampoo once, with the same results all three times: Gorgeous hair, but lots of lost hair in the shower and tons of shedding for days afterwards.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for something that is sulfate free and natural and healthy.  </li>
            <li> I love that it doesn&#x27;t contain harmful ingredients which is my main motivation for using it.</li>
            <li> This conditioner has a lovely scent to it, and it left my hair feeling healthy.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair super shiny and manageable and smooths the halo of frizz that humid summers can bring.</li>
            <li> I run out really quick bc</li>
            <li> It smells nice too, which is surprisingly rare among natural products.</li>
            <li> Thank you for these products and for Amazon that allowed me to find them and know that I will continue as a loyal customer.</li>
            <li> but it wears off quick</li>
            <li> and this helped me manage it tremendously and tamed my frizzes.</li>
            <li> I love the product, I only wish it were more affordable.</li>
            <li> Once I opened the bottle and that soothing vanilla fragrance permeated I quickly  </li>
            <li> This product does contain many moisturizing products, but nothing toxic or particularly worrisome.</li>
            <li> I am member of several hair forums and had written several post letting everyone know what a wonderful conditioner this is.</li>
            <li> I had been a loyal customer of Organix products throughout college,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s decent conditioner for sure</li>
            <li> I am super picky about conditioners.</li>
            <li> and it just leaves my hair super silky</li>
            <li> super</li>
            <li> Will buy more in the future :)</li>
            <li> i absolutely love this conditioner it makes my hair feel soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I am very impressed with this conditioner, I only wish it came it in a bigger bottle.</li>
            <li> but this has helped tremendously</li>
            <li> It has a nice, creamy texture, which I like, plus the fact that it has no sulfates is good for my thick, curly/wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner, has a wonderful fragrance and works very well for conditioning, I leave it on a little longer than normal to get the result I want.</li>
            <li> Right after I washed/conditioned my hair it felt rich.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product :)</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner, but the price is high.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have looked a long time for a good healthy shampoo and conditioner, this is most definitely the one I have been searching for.  </li>
            <li> Love having soft hair!!</li>
            <li> Love natural products!!</li>
            <li> This has a pretty strong vanilla scent which I&#x27;m not crazy about.</li>
            <li> This is a very natural conditioner that contains some great oils , I will be trying their other products to find a more mild scented one for me.</li>
            <li> Does not weigh your hair down and has a light, pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is light and leaves my hair not only smelling great but feeling soft as well.</li>
            <li> When you use it for the first time you can feel a huge difference.</li>
            <li> My hair is moisturizer, smooth and so much healthier!</li>
            <li> I love the vanilla scent and even more, I love knowing that I&#x27;m not putting harsh chemicals into my hair.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;ll be more effective for other hair types.</li>
            <li> However, I am very pleased with the conditioner overall &amp; will probably reorder.</li>
            <li> My hair is back to being very healthy</li>
            <li> I am VERY PLEASED and will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this product and will continue to purchase in the future.</li>
            <li> For a conditioner that doesn&#x27;t cause cancer, this is pretty fantastic.</li>
            <li> and I finally found a natural shampoo that helps to nourish my hair with great ingredients while leaving it shiny, light and silky.</li>
            <li> I was excited to recieve this conditioner as I am trying to use more natural products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with the results and just ordered my second bottle.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and wish there was a larger and more economical size.  </li>
            <li> The product is VERY reasonably priced for the results that it gives!  </li>
            <li> With the very first application,  my hair was  softer and silkier than it has been in years.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with SIlk18.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> Made my hair extremely smooth on the first use itself.</li>
            <li> It left my hair very healthy looking.</li>
            <li> I was comparing the ingredients list to the other conditioners, and by far this was the best.</li>
            <li> From just the first application it made my hair shiny and smooth and detangled.</li>
            <li> Ok I have the kind of hair that soaks up moisture and product like a WET VAC!  </li>
            <li> it worked good for my long ,thick,black hair</li>
            <li> are not natural, and some aren&#x27;t exactly good for you</li>
            <li> I like the smell of it afterwards too, it lasts for a long time and feels so good.  </li>
            <li> The smell is so-so; its a strong vanilla scent, but has a certain touch to it where it smells like a vanilla</li>
            <li> It is clean, soft, and has very pleasant vanilla aroma, and unlike other conditioners that take forever to wash off, this conditioner rinses off with ease.</li>
            <li> It smells great, like vanilla, and leaves my hair noticeabley silky without feeling weighed down.</li>
            <li> The product makes my hair look and fell great without weighing it down.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my 4 year old daughter who has very fine curly hair, that is prone to tangling.  </li>
            <li> I have very fine natural hair and after I get done using Silk 18 by Maple Holistics</li>
            <li> It has not felt so soft and strong in years!  </li>
            <li> I have searched high and low, and I WANT to find that great product that doesn&#x27;t cause me harm...</li>
            <li> With just one use, my hair felt brand new, silky, shiny &amp; healthy.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for 3 week now and it has become my new favorite.</li>
            <li> , we both love live it thank yoh</li>
            <li> I was using another new product at the time (a shampoo), so I wasn&#x27;t sure which was causing the problem.</li>
            <li> I will also experiment by using my clarifying shampoo paired with both the free and purchased product and show differences between this and the conditioner by Garnier - Brazilian Smooth and style as normal.</li>
            <li> I will also experiment by using my clarifying shampoo paired with both the free and purchased product and show differences between this and the conditioner by Garnier - Brazilian Smooth and style as normal.</li>
            <li> My skin is so much less itchy, my hair is great.  </li>
            <li> The highlights are damaging as is the color and damage is easily seen on my straight hair.  </li>
            <li> It can be very challenging to find a natural product that is reasonable and works well.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also using a dry oil spray that I found at Sallys and it is good too.</li>
            <li> I have a very dry,unruly and curly hair which frizzes so easily.</li>
            <li> I found this product on Amazon while searching for a really good conditioner for dry hair.  </li>
            <li> Made it here on time and in good shape, but it made my hair feel dry and brittle</li>
            <li> I have very wavy color-treated hair which frizzes easily.  </li>
            <li> I have dry scalp/thin hair and this conditioner gave a good lift and volume.</li>
            <li> I am thrilled because I know I will need to use the products several times in order to see true results.  </li>
            <li> My hair was very brittle and would break easily.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely loved it, the scalp isn&#x27;t dry anymore in the morning (heat season), the hair is shining.</li>
            <li> and I found it to be pretty good, but not necessarily a keeper.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a bit pricey but a little product goes a long way, I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase and will most probably will buy it again.</li>
            <li> saver!f my hair is EXTREMELY damaged from bleaching/straightening- the curls underneath formed thick, perfect ringlets and looked even better than my top layer...</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair feeling very soft and healthy.</li>
            <li> [&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also don&#x27;t like being asked to review this positively to receive free items.</li>
            <li> and I love what it does for my naturally curly hair!  </li>
            <li> I still got several compliments on how healthy it looked!  </li>
            <li> This product, has left my hair in the best possible condition after the first time using it.  </li>
            <li> I love the fact that it is all natural and it smells yummy!</li>
            <li> After reading all the stellar reviews, I was excited to try this product.  </li>
            <li> After the first use of Silk 18 my hair felt soft, silky and LIGHT and i love the smell.  </li>
            <li> My hope is that this product will allow me to stop relying on a straightener so that my hair can heal- I will be updating this post later to update you guys on how the top layer looks after using this product in place of a straightener for awhile, and whether my relationship with blow dryers has improved!</li>

            <li> I LOVE this conditioner so far!</li>
            <li> Smells so awesome after the 2nd or 3rd time of use I could tell my hair is much much softer!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be back for more!</li>
            <li> Luckily, it&#x27;s not very expensive, and I think it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
            <li> It contains many natural ingredients so it has a lot of benefits!</li>
            <li> Really like the conditioner!!</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference after the first use!  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still getting consistent results, which is unique.</li>
            <li> I recommend this highly!!!</li>
            <li> Definitely plan on getting some more SOON!</li>
            <li> Thank you Maple Holistics for making a safe natural product!</li>
            <li> I started using this conditioner recently and absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> Love that is is all natural!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping also a plus!!</li>
            <li> Love that its natural and still does the job!  </li>
            <li> and I can comb right through it when it&#x27;s wet, and the smell is amazing!  </li>
            <li> I was super excited about this product because of the overwhelmingly positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> The best conditioner I&#x27;ve used thus far, can feel the difference from my previous conditioner to this one.</li>
            <li> Living in the heat of the South, we probably wash and dry our hair more than most.</li>
            <li> Just soft, smooth hair with no flyaways and no chemicals or strong fragrance.</li>
            <li> Silk 18 seems better than most store brands for helping manageability of my hair, even in the dry winter season.  </li>
            <li> My hair is super soft and love the vanilla smell.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is great my hair is really dry and can never found a conditioner that helps as much as this.</li>
            <li> :) Plus it makes my hair and my husbands hair super soft and it looks healthy...never greasy.</li>
            <li> I also liked the scent, not too much but enough, it has a light sweet almond smell.</li>
            <li> First, the aroma keeps my shower stall freshly scented; most importantly, this conditioner has thoroughly replenished the natural oils in my hair.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair very light feeling and soft.  </li>
            <li> I like the scent and my hair feels very soft, so overall I would say the product is great.</li>
            <li> Like very light smell and doesn&#x27;t make hair artificially soft or chemicalized.</li>
            <li> It is also all natural ingredients which is very important to me.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my hair very smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> No matter if they are new extensions or not, nothing leaves my hair feeling nice and silky, and I&#x27;ve used many different conditioners.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner so much I am now using on my kids and their hair has never been so soft and easy to brush.  </li>
            <li> I used to have pencil straight, fine hair.</li>
            <li> conditioners don&#x27;t work on fine hair, especially those designed for fine hair, because they try to thicken the hair rather than simply smooth it.</li>
            <li> I tried this conditioner because I was looking for something that would work on my fine, straight hair.  </li>
            <li> hair is fine, straight, damaged, and dyed.</li>
            <li> But, I must say, it was perfect; it left my hair smooth and less frizzy.</li>
            <li> I am very naturalistic and enjoy that it is such a heathy way to condition my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The smell is wonderful, my hair is incredibly soft, and my curls are actually formed and soft rather than poofed out everywhere!</li>
            <li> I tried this product after trying many different products to control my frizzy fine hair.  </li>
            <li> This product has made my hair go from dry and unmanageable to silky and easy to style!!</li>
            <li> At first it did not seem special.</li>
            <li> Ordering a second bottle right away just to make sure I won&#x27;t ever run out of it!</li>
            <li> but It smells great and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling weighted down after blow drying or a co-wash!</li>
            <li> The smell is nice too, I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s too strong as other reviews say.</li>
            <li> there are wonderful vanilla and maple hues, and the scent is just the right amount of subtle when your hair dries (my boyfriend really likes it too!).</li>
            <li> It makes my hair smell amazing even a day later.  </li>
            <li> helping keep the frizz calm.</li>
            <li> I paid $ 400.00 for a keratin treatment and after switching from the real sulfate free shampoo to this one, my hair immediately changed.</li>
            <li> Works instantly and smells amazing.</li>
            <li> Stop rinsing when your hair is still very slippery and smooth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing that this condition contains all natural oils and gentle for your hair and scalp.</li>
            <li> I really, truly enjoy the product and plan to purchase the shampoo counterpart.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s extremely important that my conditioner is very detangling.</li>
            <li> My hair feels straight and frizz free.</li>
            <li> I did receive a sample of this product for free, but it doesn&#x27;t change that I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Been using this for the last two months and it is really amazing.</li>
            <li> (I have short hair) and my hair is in amazing shape in 10 days.</li>
            <li> The smell is so amazing it reminds me of amaretto and French vanilla coffee.</li>
            <li> This is a great product I have used it for a few years now</li>
            <li> Not only is their custom service amazing, but their products are a godsend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have to use as much as if I were using a cheap $3 conditioner.  </li>
            <li> It feels smooth and straight.</li>
            <li> It feels smooth and straight.</li>
            <li> After realizing that my grays have made dying my hair necessary more often than I would have liked, I decided to go natural with the all of my hair products.  </li>
            <li> My hair comes out very shiny and smooth but still has bounce and body.  </li>
            <li> Amazing I have blonde hair that is always dAmaged n</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product and defintely worth the price, plus I only have to wash my hair 1-2 a week using this</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair really soft, not heavy and love the scent, a real mild vanilla...</li>
            <li> For the price, its worth every cent.  </li>
            <li> Love products that are not harsh on my hair.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it&#x27;s 100% natural</li>
            <li> the silky texture of the conditioner did not make me lose any more hair than I naturally would have.  </li>
            <li> So far, I am pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> First things first, this stuff fantastic..</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is absolutely my favorite natural conditioner.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After treating my hair ONE time, my hair was silky and soft again and my ends are healthy after one trim about a month ago.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> A product worth telling your friends and family about.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s all in fun</li>
            <li> but I think it&#x27;s worth mentioning.</li>
            <li> but I so far love it.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s natural and not overpowering like so many products on the market.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t completely fight my frizz, but I still love it.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a more natural product to use when I stumbled upon Maple Holistics products.  </li>
            <li> The Argan shampoo helps keep my hair soft, while I use the Degrease shampoo as more of a once-a-week clarifying shampoo.</li>
            <li> My hair feels truly healthy so far.</li>
            <li> I am a professional hairstylist for 15 years and have used MANY shampoo and conditioner products and out of ALL of them</li>
            <li> I have been trying to find a more natural conditioner and gave this a shot.  </li>
            <li> I really love that it is natural and organic.  </li>
            <li> Smells great and after only a couple uses my hair feels extremely soft.</li>
            <li> and I think this is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> The photo has no additional product just freshly washed and conditioned.</li>
            <li> I used SILK 18 as deep conditioner (covered with plastic shower cup and warm towel for 20 min).</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s kind of in the middle.</li>
            <li> I can not say how well it will work when the hot humid summer is in full swing.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who wants a natural moisturizing conditioner with a warm vanilla scent.</li>
            <li> Can change drastically damaged hair into soft, shiny hair with body and lovely texture.  </li>
            <li> After searching quite a while for a Natural Conditioner that actually works I&#x27;m so happy to have found this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It makes her hair so soft and healthy without residue.</li>
            <li> It had become more manageable and frizz had reduced considerably.</li>
            <li> After switching to having more natural beauty products.</li>
            <li> I like the IDEA of what this company says they want to do here, which is to create a natural healthy conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have never been able to just wake up and walk out the door with my hair natural.</li>
            <li> It actually is quite smooth at the top.</li>
            <li> The smell is pretty sweet and does stick with you</li>
            <li> Alas, Silk is perfect for my hair</li>
            <li> ITS A BIT PRICEY BUT WORTH IT</li>
            <li> a bigger bottle would be nice, 2.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for relaxed hair but an okay produce for natural hair.</li>
            <li> And I love the scent, even though I&#x27;m sensitive to smells.</li>
            <li> , I was intrigued, and i realized that this product might really be worth it.</li>
            <li> I will say its worth trying.</li>
            <li> but I wanted something more natural.</li>
            <li> So far this is my favorite conditioner.</li>
            <li> and actually i l have a nice curl  from that.</li>
            <li> This was a great conditioner and left my hair soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li> So worth the money, so worth it.</li>
            <li> and I love the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> my hair feels soft and more manageable.  </li>
            <li> It would be nice if they had larger sized bottles.</li>
            <li> I love that I can use a natural conditioner and get these results.  </li>
            <li> Love the fact that it has natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I use it in the shower after shampooing on a daily basis, and then I use it twice a week as a deep conditioning treatment by wetting my hair with warm water, covering all my hair with the product, brush it through and then wrap it in a warm damp towel.  </li>
            <li> Pump action would be much better.</li>
            <li> you can tell it is being absorbed into your hair.  </li>
            <li> This natural conditioner did make my hair feel light silky smooth.</li>
            <li> The product has more than just natural ingredients, and in fact contains potassium sorbate.</li>
            <li> and it did a fantastic job at keeping my hair soft and smooth even after all of the stuff I had just put it through.</li>
            <li> I have been on the hunt for a natural shampoo and conditioner and after reading through many reviews decided upon Maple Holistics.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the price.  </li>
            <li> I personally think it smells like the warm brown sugar fragrance from Bath and Body Works.</li>
            <li> It seemed to have made my hair smoother and more manageable, however it wasn&#x27;t as soft as i imagined it to be.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for sulfate/paraben free products so that my hair will be soft, &amp;#34;un-wiry&amp;#34; and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I love this product it&#x27;s made my hair really soft and flexible.</li>
            <li> I just have to use another kind of deep conditioning treatment for the unruly curls and damaged ends once a week.</li>
            <li> It is all natural and safe on hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It leaves my hair extremely soft and smooth, it does a fantastic job of fighting the frizz</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is definitely worth it for the price</li>
            <li> Rarely a thought about conditioning my hair, etc.</li>
            <li> Through some searching, I came across Silk18 by Maple Holistics and was happy to see what it included (100% natural) and what it left out (no artificial fragrances, colors, and sulfates).</li>
            <li> Smells so good and leaves my hair soft but not limp.</li>
            <li> I hope that this information is useful to you and if it is then please click the helpful button.</li>
            <li> I was not even halfway through my old shampoo and conditioner bottles, but my hair was screaming at me to try something better.    </li>
            <li> I decided to order this product after reading reviews and I liked that they 100% back their products.  </li>
            <li> I am still unsure that it does absolute miracles for my hair, but it is definitely a plus in my book for the conditioner to contain ingredients that are truly good for my body.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.  </li>
            <li> Instead it left my hair feeling smooth and healthy.  </li>
            <li> Worth the cost.</li>
            <li> When I start to use this conditioner, I noticed that my hair became more elastic and soft.</li>
            <li> I love it except I don&#x27;t get the smooth feeling I do after using regular shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> Love how soft my hair feels after using it.</li>
            <li> so I sought something more natural.</li>
            <li> I even tried lots of DIY recipes to make my own (same issue).  </li>
            <li> I love the smell, the feel, and natural approach of this conditioner.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t  say it&#x27;s worth the amount paid.</li>
            <li> but my hair are much much more shiner and soft</li>
            <li> I love that it is completely natural.</li>
            <li> It really has made my hair incredibly soft, and it has a really nice vanilla scent.</li>
            <li> and it makes my hair soft and more managable.</li>
            <li> I bought one for my sister because this is a finding worth sharing.</li>
            <li> I tried Silk 18 about 3 months ago because of the product reviews, figuring it would be worth a try...</li>
            <li> My hair is silky soft and hydrated and feels better than any product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> After leaving this conditioner in my hair for 5 minutes and rinsing it out, my hair has become amazingly soft and most of the frizz has disappeared.</li>
            <li> Love how this product is all natural. ...</li>
            <li> I have to say I&#x27;m presently surprised by the results, not only did the conditioner smell great</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ALWAYS looking for products that can make my hair healthy, shinning &amp; soft.  </li>
            <li> I also love natural vs chemicals.  </li>
            <li> Love this product leaves my hair so soft</li>
            <li> Made my hair soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> Just started using the conditioner about a week ago that my boyfriend (CHRIS) bought for me, so far I really love it.  </li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s so nice because it is such a &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Overall this is a nice shampoo</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I love all the fact that it&#x27;s all natural.  </li>
            <li> It would be even better if this product is 100% natural.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, it makes my hair so silky and soft.</li>
            <li> This alone is worth a try.</li>
            <li> and so far I love this product.</li>
            <li> both my 12 year old daughter and I, age 50 are using this and the degrease shampoo and love them.</li>
            <li> and I love that it is natural.  </li>
            <li> i love that this is an all natural product.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t able to brush through my hair completely after using this product.</li>
            <li> I gave it four stars for it being natural and safe.</li>
            <li> I have used only one time, but so far I can already tell it&#x27;s a great product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the way it made my hair feel so soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li> and I can say it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Love supporting small business, especially when the results are so great!</li>
            <li> This Natural Condition Silk 18 is OK.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a natural conditioner without many chemicals to use on my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is curly and past my waist and this tames it beautifully.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s great to find a natural line without all the nasties that actually delivers.</li>
            <li> I am always on the look out for more natural products, and this is a keeper.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and makes my thins hair feel thicker and soft.</li>
            <li> I love that this is an all natural product</li>
            <li> Pricey for an 8z bottle but worth every penny</li>
            <li> Not only does it smell lovely, but I have genuinely noticed that my hair is softer, shinier, and easier to comb right out of the shower.</li>
            <li> It has a sweet but mild vanilla scent and leaves my hair soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few other Maple Holistics hair products and was more than impressed with them.</li>
            <li> It smells great and  keeps my hair super soft even when I blow dry it.</li>
            <li> I still love it and will continue to use it because my hair still feels MUCH BETTER when compared to other conditioners I have used.</li>
            <li> I got some for christmas and wasn&#x27;t to sure about it since I have tried so many other ones that supposedly helped</li>
            <li> Tried various other conditioners but this showed best results.</li>
            <li> I only use organic products and was really excited about this - but Acure conditioner worked better for my hair.</li>
            <li> I love that it is sulfate free and the subtle vanilla scent is really nice.</li>
            <li> I could tell right away, my hair was lovely and smooth with just a quick blow dry.</li>
            <li> Not only does it work, but it smells good and for the first time in awhile my kids love getting their hair brushed!</li>
            <li> Leaves your hair feeling silky soft and super easy to comb out after shampooing and conditioning.</li>
            <li> Really glad I purchased this in combination with the Argan Oil Shampoo I also bought from Maple Holistics because that leaves my hair not only clean, but tangled.</li>
            <li> 18 Conditioner makes blow drying a breeze; hair dries smooth, yet the product is not heavy; hair feels clean and vibrant!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty happy with this product, since my hair felt a little bit stronger after one use.  </li>
            <li> I flat ironed with my Chi and the results were amazing without using any additional products.  </li>
            <li> what seems like aloe juice, and a bunch of other good ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My wife is biracial with fantastic color and curls, but if you won&#x27;t give basic info to your customers willing to spend top dollar, you don&#x27;t deserve a penny.</li>
            <li> I have tried this ONE time and am so very pleased at the instant softness and shine using only a nickle size drop for hair that is to the top of my shoulders in length.  </li>
            <li> Great all natural conditioner and not expensive at all when compared to similar products.  </li>
            <li> I used it right away after I received it.</li>
            <li> right now-</li>
            <li> you can see the difference right away</li>
            <li> price is right---</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference right away after using this product.  </li>
            <li> but it was just right.</li>
            <li> this conditioner doesn&#x27;t grease your hair and it gives it the right amount of shine.</li>
            <li> SILK is the right name for this product.</li>
            <li> It soaked right into my hair when I rinsed it out my hair</li>
            <li> this is amazing, I did not like it at first actually</li>
            <li> I use a cheap box dye on my long hair and this just made it look so shiny and healthy and it feels and smells like heaven, too.</li>
            <li> and I pretty much lost hope of having touchable, smooth hair.</li>
            <li> First, I love that it is all natural with no suspicious chemicals.</li>
            <li> I am always looking for the most natural yet effective product for my dry hair and this is it.</li>
            <li> The difference was dramatic; I was very impressed.  </li>
            <li> And I love that it&#x27;s pretty natural.</li>
            <li> although this conditioner does that pretty well on its own, my hair is fussy), blow dry with cool air and then straighten to seal the follicles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure exactly of it&#x27;s ingredients but something that strong couldn&#x27;t be good.</li>
            <li> I used both products last night for the first time, and I really liked them.</li>
            <li> I was at first a little hesitant because the vanilla aroma in the bottle was quite strong, but once on my hair it toned down to a very gentle kind of aroma which was very nice.  </li>
            <li> It has a nice silky smooth texture and left my feeling very soft.  </li>
            <li> Because of the different textures it tangles very easily</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the smell of the shea butter is very strong.</li>
            <li> This is hands down an excellent product and the only hair conditioner I will ever use!!      </li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome,after the first use I knew I found something that is honesty made and does exactly what it claims to do!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Maple Holistic products!!!;)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few different products from Maple Holistics and have been impressed with most so far</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend this product, feels great to use something that is more natural for your hair that actually works!</li>
            <li> Not only is it much more natural and absent of harmful chemicals, but it has a very light vanilla smell that doesn&#x27;t overpower perfume/cologne and is quite soothing.</li>
            <li> Another plus - my husband and I loved the scent.&lt;br /&gt;However, as far as actual performance goes - I only liked it.</li>
            <li> which over time just dry out your hair on top of coating it!  </li>
            <li> Made my dry ends look and feel healthy and shiny after just one use!</li>
            <li> This conditioner has transformed my unmanageable hair from frizzy and dry to healthy looking!</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s straight anyways), and for special occasions I might straighten it (maybe max.</li>
            <li> It is made a huge difference with my dry hair and given my hair a shine and more volume.  </li>
            <li> It also keeps my hair static free during the dry winter months, which is why I wanted to this conditioner to begin with.</li>
            <li> Lovely vanilla smell that lightly lingers on dry hair.</li>
            <li> I have only found two shampoos/conditioners that help keep my hair smooth, moisturized and shiny and even easy to brush through.</li>
            <li> Although, the cluster of all positive reviews all on the same days as one another was suspicious, and honestly made me think twice about this</li>
            <li> I have used it once and can honestly say I have never had such a positive result with any product.</li>
            <li> And lastly, it has a lovely, soft sent. :-)</li>
            <li> Pairs great with their Sage Shampoo for Heavy Dandruff!</li>
            <li> am also happy with the natural ingredients, it is important to me to stay away from harsh detergents/SLS/parabens/synthetic fragrances in my skin/body care.</li>
            <li> It is a bit too sweet and didn&#x27;t really like the container.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any vanilla really, just a syrupy sweet smell that lingered FOREVER.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this product and I was totally surprised and, of course, very happy with the results, having only used it three times.  </li>
            <li> The vanilla smell is powerful at first but has a calming aroma afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;18</li>
            <li> I admit I first thought it was pricey but after using it I do feel it is worth it.</li>
            <li> I thought to myself, if the Argan left my hair this soft surely &amp;#34;Silk&amp;#34; 18 would be even better.  </li>
            <li> (I use an Argon curl cream, so I&#x27;m sure going to give them a review and some of this credit!)&lt;br /&gt;*sulfate-free - my hair dresser has been on me for a long time to move to sulfate free, yet anytime I&#x27;ve tried anything s-free, I absolutely couldn&#x27;t stand it!  </li>
            <li> Well worth a try, and if you don&#x27;t like it, their return policy is stellar.</li>
            <li> I bought this conditioner to replace my drugstore brand &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; conditioner because it had not been working that great the past couple weeks</li>
            <li> I have tried several conditioners and this one is the best by far (even when compared to the so-called regular ones).    </li>
            <li> The price is pretty good considering other brands out there</li>
            <li> I will def continue using this on my daughter&#x27;s hair and will try it on my own long hair once my Pureology runs out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for this kind of product for a long time.</li>
            <li> Make sure you leave it on for at least 2 minutes to get the most silkiness!</li>
            <li> But because it&#x27;s fine, it gets weighed down very easily.</li>
            <li> I used it along with the Argan Oil Shampoo, but the shampoo leaves my hair at first clean but very tangled.  </li>
            <li> Surprisingly the product did not leave my hair greasy or weighed down.</li>
            <li> However it smells good and it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down or make it greasy looking</li>
            <li> This conditioner works wonders, making my hair feel silky and shiny without weighing it down, and I feel good about putting it on my head.  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair manageable to brush right out of the shower and leaves it feeling smooth and light, without adding any build up back into my hair.</li>
            <li> The product finally made my hair feel silky and allowed easy stretching!</li>
            <li> Size is a little smaller than I was expecting for the price, but the product is wonderful.</li>
            <li> Not only does it smell amazing, but it also makes my hair very soft and full of life.</li>
            <li> I like that this company seems to work hard at producing healthier alternative products by using the best natural ingredients.available.</li>
            <li> I felt like I had to use a bit more than expected to cover my hair, which is fine, but I wish there were bigger bottles available because I might end up running through this one pretty quickly!</li>
            <li> Now, it&#x27;s the perfect amount of shiny, soft and managable without being greasy like some other natural conditioners made it.</li>
            <li> I have dry curly hair and it works amazing on my hair.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product for dry hair.  </li>
            <li> When I think of my hair staying beautiful and long lasting results it matters to me.</li>
            <li> The smell is delightful, the conditioner is thick, and it leaves my hair soft, silky, and never greasy.</li>
            <li> I am extremely happy with this product and only wish they sold it in a much larger size.</li>
            <li> It contains good ingredients that not only feeds my hair, but naturally moisturizes and tames my persistent frizz.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a great deep conditioning treatment, and this one definitely works for me.</li>
            <li> It is nice that not too much of it needs to be used each time so the bottle will last you quite a while.</li>
            <li> Based on my experience with this conditioner, I would reccomend it to anyone who wants a safe and natural option to protect their hair.</li>
            <li> Making sure that I rinse real well and boom, soft shiny and silky hair.</li>
            <li> I really like the idea of natural ingredients, which is better for our health.</li>
            <li> And I feel really good about using a product from a smaller company with a focus on using natural ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Truly good smelling conditioner that leaves my coarse hair feeling soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I am constantly on the hunt for good products for naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> and I comfirmed that Silk 18 Natural Conditioner repairs my dameged hair very quickly.</li>
            <li> Shockingly great on my relaxed african American hair</li>
            <li> Its a kind of miracle for my dry and tangle prone hair.</li>
            <li> I have a 2 year old daughter that has hair that tangles easily.</li>
            <li> This product leaves my hair soft, easy to brush through and style.</li>
            <li> Amazon shipped it super fast</li>
            <li> So...I went back to using the only great shampoo that seems to leave my hair on my head, instead of in the sink and the drain, and</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t really much of a scent to the conditioner, which is nice, and you only have to use about a quarter sized amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve rarely let my hair grow out for more than several months,</li>
            <li> This conditioner keeps my hair hydrated, soft, shiny and easy to comb.</li>
            <li> After I got out of the shower I let it air dry, it seemed like it was drying nicely, but then I woke up</li>
            <li> However when I use this my hair becomes soft and easy to maintain.</li>
            <li> Super silky without being greasy, shiny, healthier looking, and much easier to style.  </li>
            <li> This product came with such amazing reviews and I have to say it does work very well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 40 years old &amp; have spent a great deal of that time &amp; a lot of money to find a product to help with this hair-curse Mother Nature gave me.</li>
            <li> It has an amazing smelling soft vanilla scent and completely detangles my hair.  </li>
            <li> It smells good, my hair is so soft, and I only need about a quarter size and that&#x27;s PLENTY.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying this again, its a great product from a holistic seller local to me.</li>
            <li> Some thongs helped my scalp and left my hair a disaster or aggravated my scalp condition and left my hair feeling great.</li>
            <li> , there&#x27;s a lot less frizz going on, and I feel like my waves have been enhanced in a good way.</li>
            <li> As some know, our hair type gets really dry,really quickly, but this conditioner has given me hope.  </li>
            <li> new hair care staple!!!</li>
            <li> I have very course dry hair and this product made my hair very soft and smelled great made my hair stronger</li>
            <li> The scent is amazing and the quality is excellent, however I have very dry and very thick and very damaged color treated hair</li>
            <li> I let it air dry without adding a drop of any other products and my curls were beautiful and frizz free.</li>
            <li> Makes your hair super soft!!!</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to see that I could put a comb through my hair after using these products and not catch a single tangle.</li>
            <li> The last two days, however, I&#x27;ve had to use VERY LITTLE product and my hair smells great and looks healthy and has a &#x27;shine&#x27; to it.  </li>
            <li> The conditioner has a light scent and leaves hair soft!</li>
            <li> It was great for my long tangled hair and left my hair smelling fresh all day.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for the right conditioner for my type of hair and I am glad to say that I have finally found it.</li>
            <li> I went right back on amazon and ordered 3 more bottles in fear that the sale will be ending soon.</li>
            <li> I have very super fine hair and damaged from blow dry.  </li>
            <li> I always use high quality shampoo and conditioner because I have long curly hair, which tends to be dry and have had fairly good results, but this stuff is the bomb!!  </li>
            <li> This by far has left my hair in an amazing condition and I love how it&#x27;s all natural</li>
            <li> The Sage shampoo does not cause build-up yet, it is very gentle.</li>
            <li> This is a very high quality hair product!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to use very much of the product to get its intended results.</li>
            <li> Very gentle to my hair</li>
            <li> but I dye it very light blonde</li>
            <li> I like both very much.</li>
            <li> After four uses, I like this conditioner very much.</li>
            <li> What I don&#x27;t care for is the VERY VERY vanilla smell.  </li>
            <li> This conditioner blows almost all of them out of the water, and is very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipper.</li>
            <li> Thank you so very much</li>
            <li> This conditioner left my hair feeling very smooth, even silky.  </li>
            <li> This, along with the Hydrate shampoo, made my hair so silky, and I did not have to use very much at all.  </li>
            <li> I had such high hopes for this, due to all the wonderful reviews</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s important to say that the top of my hair is EXTREMELY damaged from bleaching/</li>
            <li> I have fine, mature hair that is curly and frizzy.</li>
            <li> I have only been able to use it a few times but my hair already feels soft and smooth and the smell is amazing!</li>
            <li> Overall I am very pleased with this product so far and can&#x27;t wait to see what the continued use will do for my hair!</li>
            <li> The conditioner leaves my hair light and airy, perhaps more than any other conditioner I have used.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> My fine highlighted hair feel silky and shiny  and feel so soft to touch even after drying them with a fan this morning.</li>
            <li> Perhaps it depends on hair type (mine is baby fine and naturally wavy/curly), or water source.</li>
            <li> price is not bad either, for a conditioner that has decent ingredients.</li>
            <li> Love live live what my hair is looking like now</li>
            <li> (I have medium length), but I was able to brush through my hair much more easily than with any other product of conditioner I have used in the past (with more product to even get the same effect that Silk 18 is able to do too).</li>
            <li> Good conditioner and a little is all you need</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited about this new product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unruly, it frizzes easily, and it&#x27;s a huge hassle if I don&#x27;t do something with it and let it dry au naturale.</li>
            <li> Combined with the Tea Tree Oil Shampoo with rosemary and lavender, a clean fresh soft feeling.</li>
            <li> And I love the scent (as does my boyfriend) - nice subtle vanilla.</li>
            <li> My hair needs the extra TLC, but overall good smell not overpowering love that its holistic and does make my hair more manageable and less frizzy,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad smell, just different, as I prefer fresh, clean smelling hair products.</li>
            <li> It is strong at first but slightly fades during the duration of the day with a lingering scent of vanilla that I love.</li>
            <li> Many conditioners tend to weigh my fine hair down, not this one.  </li>
            <li> Right now I am loving it and am looking forward to trying other products.</li>
            <li> It is a little pricey compared to drugstore brands, but the quality and great natural ingredients make it totally worth it.</li>
            <li> It smells amazing and makes my hair so soft and easy to brush wet!</li>
            <li> I would like to use only this conditioner from now on, but the cost is too high, so I will alternate between this and something more cost effective.</li>
            <li> I only wish it was sold in huge bottles!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ever used not to mention much healthier!</li>
            <li> I was scared to buy only because so many products are greasy.</li>
            <li> , it isn&#x27;t bulky, it helps the hair absorb moisture while drying, and allows me to focus on the first thing that I work on in the mornings post shower....</li>
            <li> The smell is heaven, reminds me of my vacation in Las Vegas, my hotel room smelled exactly like it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost done with my first bottle and have to say my hair has improved 10 fold</li>
            <li> My hair is so soft, smooth, manageable, and shiny.</li>
            <li> I wondered maybe the first time was coincidental</li>
            <li> I can only say that I love the results.</li>
            <li> Because this product is so natural and free of Sulfate</li>
            <li> , that been said, I am never 100% satisfied by any of them, to the point that I combined different ones that I like to get that silky feel</li>
            <li> left my hair incredibly soft and silky and most importantly without frizz.</li>
            <li> This product is great for thick hair.</li>
            <li> It leaves your hair feeling very refreshed!</li>
            <li> Even my ends of my hair are much softer!</li>
            <li> It made my hair soft and free of tangles ...</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> My only issue is that I am using more of the conditioner to fully work into my hair than I am of the shampoo.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I used this condtioner</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more and recommending this conditioner to my family and friends.</li>
            <li> Used it for the first time and never experience itchiness or any allergic reaction, I have seborrheic dermatitis/psoriasis</li>
            <li> I have blonde hair and when I get my roots touched up, we use bleach which I&#x27;m sure you all know how damaging that can be.  </li>
            <li> and this stuff really helped me!</li>
            <li> Love this product, and can&#x27;t say enough about it.</li>
            <li> First of all, the scent is heavenly.</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner, PLEASE consider making it larger oz.</li>
            <li> AND I noticed right away that I didn&#x27;t have large amounts of hair falling out anymore</li>
            <li> -really!</li>
            <li> First impression</li>
            <li> This is the first I tried this product.</li>
            <li> First of all, I like the smell (vanilla scent).  </li>
            <li> First of all, I am including pictures on a review for the first time ever because 1.)</li>
            <li> but damn I just love being blonde!)</li>
            <li> I really cannot believe the difference!</li>
            <li> Used it for the first time.</li>
            <li> Like it it make my hair look pretty and silky</li>
            <li> so I went on a search for a similar but more hydrating product</li>
            <li> I am pretty darn picky when it comes to conditioners</li>
            <li> My teenage daughter and I love this conditioner.</li>
            <li> though I would give this one a try as it was promoted as natural and sulfate free.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used this product and felt it in my hair</li>
            <li> and I will update and also leave a separate review  on the shampoo (it will most likely be another month before I</li>
            <li> This is the first conditioner I have used where I don&#x27;t need gobs of it to feel like I have covered my hair.</li>
            <li> I really like this product!</li>
            <li> First, I attempted to use it as a detangler for my 4b curls.</li>
            <li> ~) And if you like the Tresemme conditioner then you will absolutely looooove this!</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing more in the future!</li>
            <li> I re ordered a third bottle to make sure I keep it in stock.</li>
            <li> love it as a deep condition/leave in/regular condition/</li>
            <li> That being said, this conditioner smells absolutely heavenly!</li>
            <li> Will definitely buy again  :)</li>
            <li> It looks much healthier!</li>
            <li> I will definitely be trying more products by maple holistics.</li>
            <li> I have been using Silk 18 for almost two weeks now and my hair feels so much healthier!  </li>
            <li> Updated to 5 stars because we like it that much!  </li>
            <li> and it turned out really soft and light and shiny.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s pretty worrisome, but thankfully the hairline isn&#x27;t receding yet.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I try this brand</li>
            <li> It gives my hair a healthier look, and my hair feels softer after the first use.  </li>
            <li> My hair finally stopped shedding and its once again healthy.</li>
            <li> Well, after learning more about the type of chemicals that are lurking in our products and doing thorough research on various products on Environmental Working Group&#x27;s site - including line by line on this product - I decided that I would take the plunge on this</li>
            <li> The only downside is the scent, it&#x27;s more musk-like than vanilla.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s better again.&lt;br /&gt;Today I also ordered a shampoo by the same company, let&#x27;s see if it saves the situation.</li>
            <li> And that&#x27;s exactly what it did.</li>
            <li> It felt soft and smooth even after the first use.</li>
            <li> The first time I tried this conditioner, I did not like it.</li>
            <li> and it is naturally kind of rough</li>
            <li> When I&#x27;m out, I&#x27;ll be back for more.</li>
            <li> It is refreshing to come across a product that actually does what it says!</li>
            <li> I noticed a change in the texture of my hair after using it for the first time.  </li>
            <li> I used it for the first time yesterday</li>
            <li> It is warm and inviting and very soothing after a long day.</li>
            <li> This may not be appropriate for someone with thinner hair, but I benefit from some extra weight.</li>
            <li> okay let&#x27;s try this and after about 2nd week</li>
            <li> For the first time I have found a conditioner I am willing to purchase again and again.</li>
            <li> I can see results at first use.</li>
            <li> I believe that it really helps my hair to recover and be all well!</li>
            <li> All in all, I&#x27;m satisfied with this conditioner and will definitely be purchasing more in the future.</li>
            <li> The fact that it is vegan and all natural is why I bought it, but the results were fabulous.</li>
            <li> At first I was thinking this was a bit pricey -</li>
            <li> Will definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li> but with this one, I&#x27;m using about a quarter size, maybe a squeeze more, and getting the same results.  </li>
            <li> and I am always looking for products to leave my hair soft and frizz free, this product do the job.</li>
            <li> review was NOT paid for or compensated in any way; I&#x27;m actually just writing it because I&#x27;m so in love with this product.</li>
            <li> My last bottle of conditioner was okay</li>
            <li> Even after washing it out, my hair feels pretty well moisturized.</li>
            <li> The shine is back in her hair and it is much more manageable.  </li>
            <li> I recommend for any hair type and smell is absolutely  scrumptious for Men or Women!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found a better conditioner since I stopped using commercial products.</li>
            <li> not in love with the smell, it does work (detangles, conditions), but did not notice a giant difference in hair.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these products and will continue to buy them in the future.</li>
            <li> I like this conditioner which makes my hair soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product, and will definitely consider purchasing another bottle when this one is gone.</li>
            <li> I use a a quarter-size amount and the first time</li>
            <li> I will be back for more .....</li>
            <li> with humidity this conditioner does exactly what it says it will do!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this conditioner!</li>
            <li> Just tried it with a Neutrogena shampoo and it worked pretty well considering the fact that the Neutrogena shampoo is a dandruff shampoo</li>
            <li> For the first time, my hair wasn&#x27;t frizzy.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many different products because my hair has been fried from coloring it so many different times (and colors).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely buy more when I run out.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to use a whole lot!</li>
            <li> FAST SHIPPING!</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> It smells fantastic and leaves my hair feeling soft and silky.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using the product for a couple days, but I already love how it smells.</li>
            <li> I feel like it can only get better at this point.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this conditioner and plan on purchasing more in the future.</li>
            <li> My regular conditioner (tresseme platinum strength) works better than this.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li> During pregnancy and breastfeeding, I went completely natural and toxin free.</li>
            <li> This one leaves my hair pretty silky and moisturized.</li>
            <li> Considering I only wash my hair 3 times a week, though, it has lasted me longer than it would for most people.  </li>
            <li> and it has really improved my hair!</li>
            <li> I have tried several conditioners but have to say that I am extremely pleased to have found this product.  </li>
            <li> Even after air drying, my hair is still soft and smooth, as if I put silicone in it.  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff and definitely will buy it again!!</li>
            <li> I have used so many products on my hair, I try multiple throughout the year on a quest to find something that works.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it does a better job than run of the mill conditioners like Pantene or what have you, but it definitely does the job without all those chemicals, which is what attracted me to it in the first place.</li>
            <li> First off  </li>
            <li> This conditioner is worth three times as much.  </li>
            <li> I am definitely going to buy a lot more of this conditioner.  </li>
            <li> So my hair has been abused recently, but still I don&#x27;t like to use conditioners with cones in them and this is lovely.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I&#x27;ve been searching for and has no scary chemicals.</li>
            <li> So glad I finally found my brand, woohoo!!</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s going to love hearing about this stuff - and she buys quite regularly for her shelf products from Amazon</li>
            <li> I can clearly see my hair better, much smoother, much softer.</li>
            <li> so i will definitely be purchasing it through here more often.</li>
            <li> I hope the results &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34;, as I don&#x27;t think one has to buy lots of different products to maintain healthy hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it twice now and can definitely say that it is fantastic!</li>
            <li> I shampoo and condition my hair first</li>
            <li> Leaves hair very silky and tames the frizz!</li>
            <li> I have just finished up my first bottle of this product.</li>
            <li> but this may not work for everyone, so test it first on your hair type.&lt;br</li>
            <li> OMG this is the first time everrrr....</li>
            <li> At first it didnt seem to be working</li>
            <li> so it likely wouldnt get better overnight.  </li>
            <li> and I found this one recently which works magic on my hair.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> Looking forward to Maple Holistics future offerings - hopefully a better complement to their Sage shampoo is forthcoming.</li>
            <li> Overall this product is named appropriately.</li>
            <li> First, there is not gluten (wheat germ or oats), a must for me.</li>
            <li> Anytime I use a different conditioner I fall in love with this one all over again.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair so silky and really helps with frizz!</li>
            <li> I used this conditioner for the first time today and man</li>
            <li> This is the first time in my life that I didn&#x27;t have to add a oil or cream for frizz after I shampooed.</li>
            <li> I just received those samples today and they are a very generous (1.5 fl oz)!  </li>
            <li> I also installed a vitamin c shower head filter with a flexible hose a week after installing the first shower filter after reading about them and what the vitamin c does for your hair and skin.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel even better than a deep conditioning.</li>
            <li> Now if I could only get a bit more for my money...</li>
            <li> My hair is shiny, frizz free and soft</li>
            <li> I will definitely be purchasing more.</li>
            <li> but, after many months with a thyroid disorder, has grown in grainy, kinky, and coarse.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried of many different conditioners and masks</li>
            <li> First of all it should come with directions.</li>
            <li> And here&#x27;s a random fact--this stuff makes the best shaving cream ever!</li>
            <li> It is also already so much softer after just one use!</li>
            <li> Each time I use it, my hair soaks the conditioner up, so I feel it will only get better with extended</li>
            <li> but I can see why some guys have reviewed this as smelling too &amp;#34;girly&amp;#34;).  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find that it performs any better than my L&#x27;Oreal conditioner, and the L&#x27;Oreal is only a fraction of the price.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This conditioner has a gentle and fresh scent, and my curls are formed and not frizzy.  </li>
            <li> It is sulfate free and all natural.</li>
            <li> Hope this helps ;)</li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li> Overall, my hair now looks better, my scalp feels healthier</li>
            <li> Highly recommend using!!  </li>
            <li> I bought the shampoo and conditioner for her as the sulfate free products coupled with oils are what is needed to keep curly hair soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li> and I am very picky about what I use on my 3A curly hair!  </li>
            <li> I really like this product!</li>
            <li> Itchiness become unbearable with more use and red spots become visible.  </li>
            <li> I believe they currently do have some discount for buying more than one bottle</li>
            <li> I am so interested in trying this.</li>
            <li> We bought our first bottle based on revews.</li>
            <li> I used Degrease the first month</li>
            <li> Will be ordering more in the future!!</li>
            <li> My hair feels soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s all natural, free of harmful chemicals, and actually works.  </li>
            <li> My hair was straighter, bouncier and shinier after the first use.</li>
            <li> Only had to use a small amount and worked great!!</li>
            <li> After letting my stylist talk me into bleaching out sections of my hair for the first time in 14 years, my hair was feeling just about like straw post treatment.</li>
            <li> I feel like I&#x27;m using a much higher end product and the compliments from my husband as to the look and feel of my hair don&#x27;t hurt either.</li>
            <li> Thanks, Maple Holistics!</li>
            <li> it is definitely one of the better conditioners I have tried.</li>
            <li> Really like this conditioner!</li>
            <li> Natural conditioner by Maple Holistics sulfate free.</li>
            <li> Did not find this product to be particularly better than others especially after factoring its pricing.</li>
            <li> This is a crappy conditioner covered with marketing buzzwords to makes one feel crunchy and environmentally aware.</li>
            <li> Maybe it works better on somebody with short hair but def not for me.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is really natural, light, not overbearing and</li>
            <li> This is my first Maple Holistics purchase and I&#x27;m floored by the quality of this conditioner.</li>
            <li> And I did  not give up until I found exactly what I was looking for: Maple Holistics and their products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also using a natural, sulfate free shampoo in combination and I would recommend everyone do this.</li>
            <li> I get the more coarse and curly my hair has become.  </li>
            <li> If only you could get alittle more.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff and am definitely going to try one of their shampoos</li>
            <li> For the price I really don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the instant difference this shampoo and conditioner made.</li>
            <li> At first I tried this conditioner</li>
            <li> I use it with the shampoo and overall my hair seems more moisturized.</li>
            <li> , my hair is soft, frizz free</li>
            <li> and I could tell it was helping from the first use</li>
            <li> I almost always use natural/organic hair products, but this is the first time I&#x27;ve actually been able to notice a difference in how my hair feels.  </li>
            <li> I bought this conditioner along with the argan shampoo (which sadly didn&#x27;t work for me) and it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not heavy and it&#x27;s not too light</li>
            <li> My hair was soft and tangle free.</li>
            <li> I had started developing a static problem that prompted me to change shampoo and conditioner to this brand and that is entirely eliminated.  </li>
            <li> I  really enjoy the natural vanilla scent as well; I wish they would add it to the shampoo.</li>
            <li> Seemed like the perfect product ... until I noticed something unsettling.  </li>
            <li> After the first shampoo and conditioning treatment I see a difference.</li>
            <li> Her first application</li>
            <li> When I have more time in the morning I will actually apply this conditioner and wrap my hair up</li>
            <li> cause its got good ingredients and sulfate, sodium chloride, dyes, harsh salts, parabens and gluten</li>
            <li> Squeaky clean and very soft.</li>
            <li> My hair is dry, frizzy, damaged and breaks off very easily.  </li>
            <li> First of all I&#x27;m a cosmetologist that has access to all the professional products and have tried many and always looking for new ones at the beauty supply.</li>
            <li> I have very fine long hair, prone to frizz and dryness - this conditioner works wonders.</li>
            <li> I have fairly long, color treated hair that is very fine</li>
            <li> I have very fine and often tangled long hair.</li>
            <li> but I am very excited to try different products from this line after my first experience.</li>
            <li> After only a few uses, this is remarkable!  </li>
            <li> \\&quot;I really enjoy this conditioner, I tried many different homemade all natural shampoos and conditioners, and never had positive results.</li>
            <li> My fussy hair goes super smooth after only one time using the product.</li>
            <li> I went from needing to use so much product to leaving my hair to naturally dry and look amazing.</li>
            <li> My hair feels softer, shinier, and more important, less frizzy.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth buying, made my hair super soft and</li>
            <li> My hair has always been really dry, so I was looking for a good, natural conditioner.</li>
            <li> I use this with the Tea Tree Shampoo for moderate dandruff with argan and jojoba offered by Maple holistics, and my hair feels very clean and soft ... and dandruff free.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very excited to see what the future hold for my tresses with continued use!</li>
            <li> I have paid much more for other products with poor results, I am very happy to have discovered this companies hair products.</li>
            <li> Still very soft, I am in love with this product now, plus it didn&#x27;t bother my sensitive hands.  </li>
            <li> Received my silk 18 conditioner and was pleasantly satisfied, smooths my frizzy ends, leaves my natural hair very soft &amp; moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> For some people this conditioner alone works just fine, but for my hair I feel like I need a little bit more</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner, sweet vanilla scent with some other herbs and stuff.  </li>
            <li> My hair is left soft, shiny, and smelling FANTASTIC!!</li>
            <li> And then the next day when I did the shampoo followed by Silk 18, holy leaping cow - I can honestly say I LOVE this conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I super recommend this product for normal hair like mine.</li>
            <li> Smells so good and helps me tame frizzies.</li>
            <li> Its scent is barely there, not too strong.  </li>
            <li> Has good &#x27;slip&#x27; for a natural product that isn&#x27;t full of silicones like cheaper conditioners that only make your hair feel good temporarily but make it worse over time.  </li>
            <li> This conditioner not only smells great (a not over powering vanilla scent), but works like no other natural conditioner I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> the record, I have thin, fine hair, that needs a good washing about three times a week...</li>
            <li> After using it a couple of times, I don&#x27;t see or feel any difference in my very long, very fine, chemically treated hair..  </li>
            <li> It is hard to find the right balance, but I think this product does an amazing job of delivering just the right amount of moisture!</li>
            <li> I have hightlights in my hair ( very fine hair), and it gets a bit frizzy and dry after its highlighted.</li>
            <li> Other than that this conditioner is amazing.</li>
            <li> The ingredient deck is AWESOME (minus containing Alcohol a little premature in Ingrd. deck )</li>
            <li> you can have soft, silky hair without all the chemicals in this great little bottle.</li>
            <li> It really leaves my fine hair which tends to be dry and frizzy, silky smooth and manageable.</li>
            <li> My natural hair color looks darker and rich.</li>
            <li> This is not usually a scent I go for because it smells sweet</li>
            <li> I am only on my second use though and my hair feels pretty good.</li>
            <li> Because of this conditioner my hair is full, smooth, shiny, thick, healthy and bouncy.</li>
            <li> but this doesn&#x27;t give me any kind of irritation or any other bothersome outcome</li>
            <li> My daughter and I have completely different hair types; hers is super course and curly and mine is fine and straight.  </li>
            <li> and I figured why not try something new since I&#x27;ve loved Maple Holistics other products.</li>
            <li> I have very dry scalp and have tried practically every shampoo and conditioner on the market, and this is by far the best I have tried, I started using the silk18 about 1 month ago with the Sage shampoo and my dry scalp is gone.</li>
            <li> Works very well for me, makes my hair softer, but doesn&#x27;t help control my frizzyness very much, the smell is pretty neutral too me.</li>
            <li> I have pretty coarse hair and this stuff smoothed it out beautifully without weighing it down or leaving it looking greasy.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is a fantastic product, makes your hair soft without weighing it down and it leaves a nice scent.</li>
            <li> The only reason I give it 4 stars is because my hair doesn&#x27;t feel quite as soft after it dries, however, that could very well simply be attributed to my fine, blond hair that seems to get a dry and tangled no matter how wonderful the product is!</li>
            <li> You now have a new loyal costumer ☺️5 Stars</li>
            <li> It really keeps my hair soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> This product is very good......makes my hair frizz free and soft.</li>
            <li> my  long hair is now  naturally shiny and very healthy...</li>
            <li> Silk 18 has a great, subtle aroma.</li>
            <li> Really leaves my hair silky smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> I received this along with my maple holistics tea tree dandruff shampoo earlier than expected, which was great.</li>
            <li> I only used it a couple of times but so far this conditioner is amazing.</li>
            <li> So, I will continue to use this conditioner as it works great ... just be careful on what shampoo you use prior to it.</li>
            <li> My hair feels so clean without feeling stripped of its natural oils.</li>
            <li> It changes it from dry and brittle, to more soft and smooth like silk.</li>
            <li> it left my hair really soft and easy to detangle but because of the aloe vera in it, you have to watch your dew levels to avoid a huge poofy look to your hair.</li>
            <li> This conditioner made my hair clean, soft, and moisturized.  </li>
            <li> After a week, my scalp is still clean and my hair is soft and not fly-away.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair was left so soft and nice, yet, I was at ease using it.  </li>
            <li> I only buy organic or natural products for my skin and hair and I dabble in making my own at home.</li>
            <li> I used this conditioner for the past 2 weeks and my hair is consistently soft shiny and beautiful.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this conditoner and felt it wouldn&#x27;t be fair to post a review without actually trying it for a period of time.  </li>
            <li> Not only does this smell nice but it leaves your hair silky soft.</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s made my hair a lot more manageable and soft.  </li>
            <li> I currently use Lush shampoo bars which are also nice</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who wants their hair to look and feel healthy.</li>
            <li> once i used the conditioner it left my hair so nice and soft and</li>
            <li> This did leave my color treated hair soft and I love that it is all natural.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying for the longest time to find an effective natural sulfate-free conditioner that actually conditions my hair without leaving it greasy or feeling hay like.</li>
            <li> only gripe is that the product is a bit pricey, but I am loving it so far</li>
            <li> This conditioner has made my hair unbelievably soft, and now I even find that after I shower, my hair has that hair commercial-like shininess to it (which I honestly thought only straight-haired women got).</li>
            <li> I honestly woke up with my hair so soft that I wanted to see if it comes in bigger sizes.  </li>
            <li> It seems to me that Silk18 brightened my natural, kind of dishwater-ey blonde and also removed some of the the brassiness elsewhere</li>
            <li> With continued use I&#x27;m sure this is going to clear it up completely.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad to have finally found something that really works.</li>
            <li> This natural conditioner is my favorite so far.</li>
            <li> This is gentle and smells great and the only thing I trust on her sweet little head.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;m trying this product, hope it;s as good as the other reviews I have read so far</li>
            <li> At first I thought the vanilla scent smelled fake, but the more I use it, the more I really enjoy the smell.  </li>
            <li> Her hair is oily and mine is dry and the shampoo barely needs a conditioner even for me, and both leave our hair clean, smooth, shiny, comfortable.</li>
            <li> My hair simply did not feel CLEAN!</li>
            <li> Makes my hair super shiny and soft!  </li>
            <li> It is nice and light which isn&#x27;t enough for my very dry hair sometimes.</li>
            <li> I loved this conditioner because you only need a little to detangle and smooth out your hair.</li>
            <li> so it gets really dry especially after coloring it but this conditioner is amazing!</li>
            <li> I liked how it made my hair feel, but having a quick reaction usually means something is in this that may not be pointed out.</li>
            <li> First, the slight vanilla scent is really nice and soothing.</li>
            <li> I was fooled by all the positive ratings.</li>
            <li> , I read the reviews and they were all positive</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand the positive reviews because I read those before I purchased this and those people either have no hair</li>
            <li> I read all the positive reviews and decided to try this conditioner on the strength of those reviews.</li>
            <li> The card that asks for a review requests for the buyer to leave a review, it does not say leave a positive review.</li>
            <li> I came across this conditioner on Amazon and decided to give it a try with all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> I was concerned if all the positive reviews were legit....</li>
            <li> and I found the smell and the texture of people&#x27;s hair seemed to come up a lot in positive remarks.</li>
            <li> I tried this conditioner based on the positive reviews it had gotten on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> After reading positive reviews of the product I wanted to give it a try myself.</li>
            <li> I was super excited because I have low porosity 4c hair and the amino acids really help with moisture retention and manageability.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended, especially to the ladies with fine hair!</li>
            <li> I have long hair and have been getting compliments on how healthy my hair looks after using this conditioner.</li>
            <li> In the long run it is better to get this item and try it.</li>
            <li> I am so happy with this purchased that I feel tempted to get rid of all my other conditioners because I feel like this is the only one I need.</li>
            <li> And my hair feels clean, no residue, no slightly greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ve tried argan oil, conditioning treatments, overnight creams, curl cream, mousse, keratin, coconut oil, and pretty much</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty picky about my hair products, so this stuff is really knocking it out of the ballpark for me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It leaves my hair feeling really silky and smooth, much nicer than any natural conditioner I&#x27;ve tried before.</li>
            <li> BUT, I deal with it because it makes my long hair feel healthy.</li>
            <li> When i first used the conditioner i didn&#x27;t use much and as i was applying the conditioner was not spreading to all of my hair</li>
            <li> After dying my hair for the first time, so much of it fell out.</li>
            <li> I love that it also helps untangle my long, wavy hair.</li>
            <li> - I have about 22-24 inches of hair in long layers and slightly more</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s because they are more powerful than the other stuff that can be found on the market.</li>
            <li> The smell is pretty reasonable for a conditioner not overly powering which is why I bought it.</li>
            <li> love it and will stay with this brand for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Wish</li>
            <li> I stumbled on Maple Holistics while doing some online Christmas shopping last year, and decided that it was worth a shot to splurge on a more natural product, even if it wasn&#x27;t specifically a curly-hair</li>
            <li> After searching for random things on Amazon, I came across this Silk 18 Natural Conditioner &amp; saw so many great reviews, I decided to give it a shot.  </li>
            <li> , I have really dry/fried/frizzy/damaged hair and this has helped so much!</li>
            <li> I have tried so many conditioners and although they may have temporarily conditioned my hair, in the long run they were doing nothing for my hair.  </li>
            <li> I feel good about using a natural product and a natural product that actually works well</li>
            <li> I have fairly wavy hair that usually gets a bit frizzy.</li>
            <li> Her hair looks clean, soft, shiny and her scalp feels great and still makes her long thick hair easy to brush with no weigh-down.</li>
            <li> If possible it might be good to also have a bigger size with a pump also at a reasonable price (around $20).</li>
            <li> /&gt;Consistency of this product is also good , so you need to use small amount and you are done.</li>
            <li> Also, my top layer of hair always seemed to be moisturized but the bottom layer - especially at the nape of my neck - remained slightly brittle and would tangle very easily.   </li>
            <li> 18 Natural Conditioner seems to be keeping my hair more and more manageable , less frizzy, and softer !</li>
            <li> Smell is amazing, and it conditions my hair without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> This conditioner leaves everyones hair in my family looking amazing without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> It smells amazing and conditions my hair without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is on par with the Perfect 10 brand for less than half the price.  </li>
            <li> It creates a nice slip and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down or make it feel greasy.  </li>
            <li> Then I can let my hair air dry wavy, or I can blowdry it straight, and it looks smooth, shiny, full, and doesn&#x27;t frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have dry, frizzy curly hair and this made it smell nice and feel soft after the first wash.</li>
            <li> I have been trying many natural conditioner choices lately and thought this one might be it since it had such great ratings.</li>
            <li> I have tried and used so many different shampoos and conditioners but this one is one of the best using natural ingredients and not as expensive as Wen.  </li>
            <li> My hair is naturally very fine &amp; easily tangled, especially when wet.</li>
            <li> I use this on all of my little girls and we all love it!</li>
            <li> next couple days while I wait for my full bottle!  </li>
            <li> My scalp is not itchy and does not dry out as fast; I live in the desert and it sure leaves a strain on my hair.</li>
            <li> For instance I love clean smells such as the combination of citrus and white pepper.</li>
            <li> I have been dealing with flaky dandruff dry scalp to top it off...</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised that this conditioner worked so well on my super tangled hair.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s coarse and tends to frizz easily.</li>
            <li> I have very fragile hair that breaks easily.  </li>
            <li> I actually use this as a deep conditioner and again am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> your hair is dry, you&#x27;ll probably love this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very particular about what products I use on my hair</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel super soft and silky.</li>
            <li> ends are still a bit dry after although most of my hair texture comes out softer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I ordered this because I have really dry hair and wanted more moisture and shine.  </li>
            <li> another note, for those individuals with super sensitive skin, this is the product to use...</li>
            <li> I have curly, highlighted hair and after switching from drugstore shampoo and conditioner to this and their Hydrate shampoo for dry hair, my hair has never looked better.</li>
            <li> It is not moisturizing enough for normal and healthy hairs.</li>
            <li> I have short wavy hair and it has a tendency of getting frizzy very quickly as soon as I leave the house.</li>
            <li> My hair became more brittle and dry.</li>
            <li> I could not believe how it left my hair silky and easy to comb through.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have normal hair and leaves my hair feeling and looking soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry hair and love this conditioner.</li>
            <li> All of the &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; conditioners I have tried make my hair even more dry and brittle, but they do stop my hair from falling out (so that must have been a chemical problem)</li>
            <li> Hair feels super soft and silky.</li>
            <li> also have super sensitive skin...</li>
            <li> my hair super soft, manageable and</li>
            <li> Makes my hair super shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so strong that it took hours and multiple washings for the smell to leave my hands.  </li>
            <li> I have yet to find a conditioner that helps my thin, fine hair be more full.</li>
            <li> 5 days later I received a complimentary full sized bottle of this conditioner as promised..</li>
            <li> But regardless of the what scent it has, it is just too strong enough to give me a headache.  </li>
            <li> I do not use fragrance(s) and prefer my hair not have such a strong sustained fragrance.  </li>
            <li> Wonderful product, I have long thick hair</li>
            <li> Once dry, my hair felt great very soft and shiny, I even had an extra oomph of volume.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t contain any harsh ingredients, it smells wonderful and leaves my hair super soft without weighing it down or making it feel sticky.</li>
            <li> Finally found one that works great with detangling and does not weight our hair down.  </li>
            <li> It has certainly lived up to her expectations and mine.</li>
            <li> When I wash my hair, I let the conditioner soak in as directed and rinsing it out is like feeling pure silk in your hair.</li>
            <li> The large in the cocoons are boiled to death so that the cocoon bodies unravel to produce the silk.</li>
            <li> I certainly recommend that you buy this and see for yourself.</li>
            <li> I have very fine and thin hair; most often my hair felt blah.  </li>
            <li> The thing I like most is how easily it rinses out... far quicker than other products in this price range, which is high.</li>
            <li> Great silky feel and allows me to wet brush through my long hair!</li>
            <li> I have pretty thick wavy hair, and this does a great job at keeping it soft, and not too frizzy.</li>
            <li> After a few more uses, I am even happier with this product!  </li>
            <li> Now that I have used this conditioner a few times, I must say I love it!  </li>
            <li> I was searching for a cheap nAtural conditioner to get my frizzy hair under control now that I live in Hawaii.</li>
            <li> : Added a couple more pictures (fourth and fifth) after trying a new hair styling routine.</li>
            <li> : Added a couple more pictures (fourth and fifth) after trying a new hair styling routine.</li>
            <li> I live in Canada and we are Snowbirds, and you can be sure that I will bring a supply back home with me.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a good conditioner to go along with my new organic shampoo that I purchased a few weeks ago.  </li>
            <li> This conditioner makes my hair feel silky, look shiny, and allows me to comb through my thick, wavy hair much more easily without needing to use a leave-in conditioner.</li>
            <li> This product is the best remedy for my dry, frizzy, thick, curly, color treated hair.</li>
            <li> really this product leaves your hair super soft.</li>
            <li> It is very creamy and leaves my hair super shiny and soft.  </li>
            <li> Now, after 2 washes, my hair feels as soft as my 7 year olds, and get this--I don&#x27;t even have to blow it dry for it to look nice.</li>
            <li> Texture is very silky and easy to apply, don&#x27;t need to use a ton; which, with my hair being coarse and curly, I tend to blow through conditioner rapidly.</li>
            <li> My hair became very dull and I experienced some hair breakage after having my hair hi-lited.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so sold on this whole line because they use natural ingredients, as well as they make my hair amazingly soft, tangle free and so much healthier!</li>
            <li> I read a review that mentioned that Maple Holistics was offering a free product if you left a positive review.</li>
            <li> -- mine is short, gray, and somewhat fine.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m back to no hair loss in the shower or throughout the day) and works fine too.</li>
            <li> I really love that it made my coarse hair soft!</li>
            <li> I not only generally love this product but also I adore the fact that it&#x27;s made from natural ingredients and not tested on animals!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product several times now, and it seems like an affordable product for curly hair, plus it offers really great moisture for anybody with dry hair.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews, I decided to try Silk 18 and one other brand and from the first time I used it, I was in LOVE.  </li>
            <li> I have used one bottle of Silk 18 and have ordered another, primarily because I like that it is comprised of more of the natural ingredients than the typical hair product.</li>
            <li> I am pretty particular about conditioners</li>
            <li> It is much softer and I just let it air dry and work some coconut serum through it to get rid of the last bit of frizzies and it is good to go.  </li>
            <li> (Note: I had been using a very high end conditioner &amp; matching shampoo by a company that makes professional/salon haircolor).</li>
            <li> have unruly hair that is very high maintenance;&lt;br /&gt;Silk</li>
            <li> It has a deep warm vanilla smell and leaves my hair feeling very soft and natural.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very humid where I live right now</li>
            <li> It is a great conditioner, but a little heavy for my fine, curly hair.  </li>
            <li> this i have to pour out a large amount since it doesn&#x27;t have as much slickness, and i feel like i pull my hair out when i brush it through with my fingers..</li>
            <li> Its a little pricey for the size, but I&#x27;m telling you, its amazing stuff.  </li>
            <li> I have fine, thick, frizzy hair, and the frizz is so much better when I use this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I used the Hydrate Shampoo first and left it on my hair and scalp for 3 minutes as recommended, and then rinsed it clean.  </li>
            <li> It does the job without weighing my already fine, straight hair totally lifeless.</li>
            <li> I fill it right in my scalp-it alive now!</li>
            <li> Anyway, I used this conditioner with high hopes considering the name (Silk 18) and stellar reviews.</li>
            <li> I have always had to use more expensive brands of shampoos and conditioners and we have tried more brands and spent more money than I care to recall over the years!</li>
            <li> I started  using the Argan Shampoo and Silk Conditioner, the first time I used my hair been so easy to deal with, strong,  thick, and so shine</li>
            <li> And I think it actually makes my fine, thin hair look somewhat fuller, which is great.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s hard to find a good conditioning</li>
            <li> My hair isn&#x27;t as frizzy or dry anymore due to the great ingredients that are in the product.</li>
            <li> their website will send you a free sample to try first, I only buy high end hair products</li>
            <li> Using only a little bit, and despite being sulfate free it suds up nicely and gets my hair very clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> I agree with the many other positive reviews.</li>
            <li> I have been using this conditioner for a few years now and it is absolutely amazing.  </li>
            <li> so even though I know it still looks very poofy to some, just know that this is seriously such a huge improvement for me.</li>
            <li> so even though I know it still looks very poofy to some, just know that this is seriously such a huge improvement for me.</li>
            <li> Third, I really like that it&#x27;s sulfate free.</li>
            <li> and I have instantly noticed a huge difference.</li>
            <li> The last time I visited my hair stylist for a cut &amp; color, I had only just ordered Silk 18 and used the conditioner one time, and my stylist could not stop freaking out at how shiny and amazing my hair looked.  </li>
            <li> However,  I really like this product.</li>
            <li> I straightened my hair and my hair looked so much softer and thinner than ever because there is no chemicals or sulfates in it</li>
            <li> This Maple Holistics product works really well</li>
            <li> This treatment reminds of conditioners I have purchased at the salon that cost twice as much.</li>
            <li> I really like them both.</li>
            <li> I really like the almond scent</li>
            <li> Within 3 uses, my hair became so much smoother.</li>
            <li> It really made my hair stop falling out as much (</li>
            <li> That said, my scalp gets really itchy and I was hoping this would cure it.</li>
            <li> I really like this conditioner.</li>
            <li> I can really see the difference in my hair and scalp.</li>
            <li> It really isn&#x27;t an issue</li>
            <li> I really like all of the maple holistics products that I have purchased.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my hair very hydrated</li>
            <li> My hair has a natural wave to it in the back and underneath and is straight in the front and on top.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very picky about my conditioner.</li>
            <li> i purchased this product based on the reviews and it really does what it claims.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe this is actually sulfate free.</li>
            <li> I leave it in while I wash to really let it soak into my ends.</li>
            <li> My hair is no longer frizzy, it&#x27;s much stronger and does not break off anymore.  </li>
            <li> It is very concentrated, so</li>
            <li> and I wanted a heavier finish, but now that it&#x27;s a bit longer not so much.</li>
            <li> But I really like it.</li>
            <li> And it moisturized very well, didn&#x27;t leave build up and untangled my hair.</li>
            <li> Using a bit more than a pea size amount left my hair soft and my scalp really relaxed.</li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> I really like this conditioner.</li>
            <li> and I really like that.</li>
            <li> My hair is very curly and tends towards dryness.</li>
            <li> but I really like it.  </li>
            <li> Minus one star because the scent is not my favorite</li>
            <li> but I really like this one.</li>
            <li> Even using the diffuser didn&#x27;t really help at all.</li>
            <li> You will not immediately be able to run your hands through your hair, and it will not feel silky while it&#x27;s wet.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this conditioner after all the rave reviews</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t leave my hair as smooth as a regular product (like Pantene for example).</li>
            <li> I could run my fingers through my hair and really get it worked in.</li>
            <li> Left my hair smooth and silk.</li>
            <li> This conditioner leaves my hair silky smooth, definitely will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m at 3 weeks now and my hair is much improved.  </li>
            <li> Very impress</li>
            <li> I tried so many products throughout my life but my prayers were unanswered as Curly hair doesn&#x27;t suit me .</li>
            <li> somehow when i apply this conditioner, i feel too much of hair fall during wash...</li>
            <li> it has a real swing to it now...and people have remarked on it.  </li>
            <li> My hair is very damaged.  </li>
            <li> I find I don&#x27;t need to use as much argan oil-based leave in conditioner as I did before.</li>
            <li> After about a week of using it my hair looked so much healthier.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> My hair is very course and a bit damaged though, so it may work for you if your hair isn&#x27;t damaged at all.</li>
            <li> , I recommend this products  to every one, it work for all  hair, Thank you so much  Maple Holistic,</li>
            <li> Definitely silky smooth</li>
            <li> I have a ton of hair so this is going to go fast.</li>
            <li> I really  like the smell.</li>
            <li> I dye my hair light blonde</li>
            <li> its used to much lather in shampoos and conditioners..</li>
            <li> I feel like leaving in the conditioner to sit in my hair works really well</li>
            <li> I have very acne prone skin</li>
            <li> Also the price is so reasonable for the quality.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughters&#x27; very curly hair.</li>
            <li> They both really like it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> It really softens crunchy hair.</li>
            <li> so it wouldn&#x27;t get washed out before I was ready.</li>
            <li> None of them really worked well.  </li>
            <li> shampoo conditioner that I really like.  </li>
            <li> so this conditioner may do better on coarser hair or even no straight</li>
            <li> When I use these hair products I really feel like I am doing my hair a favor.</li>
            <li> I really do. :</li>
            <li> Really helps detangle my hair.  </li>
            <li> I am very picky with my conditioner.</li>
            <li> I really couldn&#x27;t believe it.  </li>
            <li> I was initially very scared of using anything homeopathic.</li>
            <li> really recommended</li>
            <li> I really this conditioner, even though it leaked all over the packaging.</li>
            <li> It feels so much softer when I run my fingers through it</li>
            <li> Also, the curls stay very well defined.</li>
            <li> I really like this conditioner.  </li>
            <li> so I have tried serums to control frizz, but I ended up with unusual side effect...</li>
            <li> but it is very lightweight</li>
            <li> The scent is gentle and not overpowering.</li>
            <li> I realized then how much this conditioner has been helping me.</li>
            <li> Better than expected - if it continues to work I will give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> /nasty like the grocery store conditioner I had been using (for about 10 min after applying the cheap conditioner, my hands would always feel so gross even after washing)</li>
            <li> My hair was breaking off a lot and after using this product I can really tell a difference.</li>
            <li> and I really like it, though it does pull out a lot of color from my hair --</li>
            <li> I have gray hair and this leaves it very silver.</li>
            <li> However, Maple Holistics contacted me to see If I was satisfied with this product, When I told them not really</li>
            <li> The tangles come out much easier.</li>
            <li> really it works.....</li>
            <li> This product really makes a difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> Very unmanageable.  </li>
            <li> but it left my hair feeling wonderful/soft and light after one use.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this shampoo along with the Silk 18 conditioner about a month ago, and I can really see and feel a difference in my hair.  </li>
            <li> I started washing with a Maple Holistics shampoo for dandruff/dry scalp, condition with this for 5-15 minutes depending on how much time I have, follow it up with a detangling spray (</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Nexus Color Assure sulfate-free shampoo for about a month, which I really like, but adding this conditioner has made a noticeable difference.  </li>
            <li> My hair absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li> I never thought I would ever find a product that actually, really worked!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried to use it sparingly because I didnt want to go through it so fast.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I really like this conditioner.</li>
            <li> I use Maple Holistics shampoo which I really like as it makes my hair feel  so much thicker</li>
            <li> After much research, i stumbled upon this product on amazon.</li>
            <li> I really like this conditioner a lot.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t need to use too much.</li>
            <li> The conditioner works very well.</li>
            <li> It is vanilla-scented and very soothing.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really give me any noticeable results.</li>
            <li> Added some moisture but not as much as i had desired.</li>
            <li> I found this product to be very oily, so much so that my hair looks and feels oily for two days after using it.  </li>
            <li> and I really believe it earned it&#x27;s name &amp;#34;silk!&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> Overall, a great conditioner that I would recommend to anyone looking for a healthy alternative and anyone with damaged, thin hair like mine!</li>
            <li> I also really like the way it smells.</li>
            <li> so conditioning is an absolute must</li>
            <li> &amp;#34; Whether is it vegetarian and ethically raised, ask the the company where they get their silk protein.</li>
            <li> but I guess that is the whole point of Silk 18.</li>
            <li> This in combination with the Sage Shampoo has really helped me.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do much for my hair</li>
            <li> My hair feels much smoother.  </li>
            <li> It did NOTHING for tangled hair and didn&#x27;t really help with frizz either...</li>
            <li> This is absolutely miraculous.</li>
            <li> I actually really like it.</li>
            <li> This conditioner makes my hair very shiny and silky.  </li>
            <li> and this allows me to comb it straight out of the shower.......</li>
            <li> I am using it in the shower each time I wash my hair, and really like the application-</li>
            <li> I am a real jerk to my hair</li>
            <li> So I really needed a product that can help my hair keep its moisture.</li>
            <li> I really like the smell too.</li>
            <li> Much to my surprise, after using this conditioner twice, it transformed my hair from straw to silk.</li>
            <li> Price point is a bit of a challenge for the size but worth it for the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> It also really nourishes--not just coats the hair.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even know if that&#x27;s legal??</li>
            <li> I really hope I get to try it.</li>
            <li> Really wanted to like this product after reading all the reviews.</li>
            <li> My hair is soo much thicker after using this.</li>
            <li> This conditioner makes that much easier to do.</li>
            <li> Very smoky vanilla type smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this conditioner for a couple of months now and really like it.</li>
            <li> Aside from that, I really like this conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have extensions in (real hair, tape in-</li>
            <li> Really like this stuff</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been battling my whole life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> --I used to simply pick any shampoo that &amp;#34;looked good,&amp;#34; was priced cheap and used it until finished with the bottle.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t need to use nearly as much conditioner to untangle my hair with this product.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll really like it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already had to cut too much off and was looking for something to salvage the rest until it can grow out.</li>
            <li> Also the rep was very knowledgeable</li>
            <li> I really like the product.</li>
            <li> Delivered on time but product made my hair very tangly.</li>
            <li> it really put the moisture in my hair.</li>
            <li> I really want to try their shampoo with tea tree and see if that helps my thinning and hair breaking off.</li>
            <li> It really works well on my color treated and curly hair.  </li>
            <li> , really.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to others!  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to all!</li>
            <li> It really depends on your hair type.</li>
            <li> Has a lot more chemical ingredients than I expected, but I tried it out.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t very concentrated.</li>
            <li> I use it on my 8 yr olds very curly hair</li>
            <li> I was very disapointed with the results.</li>
            <li> After using this conditioner once, I could feel my hair was much softer and hydrated.</li>
            <li> My hair is overly processed and this product has really helped repair it.  </li>
            <li> I have very curly hair</li>
            <li> Then I proceeded to use my straight iron to style my hair</li>
            <li> and I refuse to pay that much money for something I use every day and go through quickly.&lt;br /&gt;After reading reviews on this product I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> So I can&#x27;t brush it very often which was causing hideous tangles.</li>
            <li> makes brushing much easier since its so conditioned.  </li>
            <li> My hair feels very silky after use, and my biggest concern of having an allergic, itchy reaction did not come to pass.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s much healthier for my scalp and hair than what I&#x27;d been using before.</li>
            <li> This smells absolutely divine.</li>
            <li> I give it four stars because I think the price is a bit much for the size of the bottle.</li>
            <li> I really, really did.</li>
            <li> wish I could tell you that I absolutely adored the product and will be purchasing it again.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I really like using this conditioner.</li>
            <li> It really moisturizes my hair, but it also rinses out very well.</li>
            <li> Haha.</li>
            <li> The amino acids &amp; silk proteins really get to work on your hair and you can tell the difference immediately.</li>
            <li> but it really doesn&#x27;t bother me.  </li>
            <li> This product, while probably works, can&#x27;t really be used.  </li>
            <li> In reality removing a smell by dominating it with something else really just enhances both.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely noticed a difference in the vibrancy and resiliency of my hair after just one use.</li>
            <li> Left my hair so silky and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I use this along with the Tea Tree lice treatment shampoo you have and will not buy another conditioner unless I absolutely have to.  </li>
            <li> In fact, I really like it.</li>
            <li> I really like the fragrance</li>
            <li> MY HAIR IS REALLY</li>
            <li> but I would much rather a herbal or flowery smell.</li>
            <li> I already have thinning hair (thanks to thyroid and hormone issues)</li>
            <li> The combination really helps my scalp.</li>
            <li> Also,  I did not find this conditioner very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> ;  I&#x27;m real.  </li>
            <li> I really like the conditioner.</li>
            <li> make my hair soooo much softer.</li>
            <li> I really wanted this product to work.</li>
            <li> It makes brushing my daughters hair much easier.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After I used the cleansing scalp shampoo, my hair was VERY stripped and brittle and after I put the Silk 18 on, it almost immediately softened and detangled.</li>
            <li> I believe this would really help ty</li>
            <li> Silk 18 is gentle and conditions thoroughly without leaving any build-up.</li>
            <li> , you really have no idea</li>
            <li> So much so that my bathroom looks like the hair care isle in a store.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and plan to buy it again!</li>
            <li> I like the shampoo so much</li>
            <li> The conditioner worked really well on my hair.</li>
            <li> However I really didn&#x27;t like the scent...</li>
            <li> I have paid so much money for hair products and now I ask myself why?</li>
            <li> It really helped his flakes.  </li>
            <li> Like real vanilla, not like cake.  </li>
            <li> My only negative is it kind of burned my eyes more then</li>
            <li> I like it so much</li>
            <li> I have hair below my chest and it really gets all of it and well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really silk in a bottle.  </li>
            <li> , my hair feels so much softer.</li>
            <li> I recently switched to sulfate free shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> The customers reviews really helped me a lot.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair very tangly.</li>
            <li> I really like this conditioner.  </li>
            <li> so it really makes up for the cost</li>
            <li> Ooooo, the vanilla smell is absolutely DEVINE</li>
            <li> so i don&#x27;t focus to much on taking care of my hair</li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> But I really do like the way it leaves your hair feeling.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Almost totally dandruff free already&amp;#34;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This conditioner leaves my hair with so much bounce and body.</li>
            <li> I  apply this product as a leave-in conditioner on wet hair mostly.  </li>
            <li> It has never had so much volume.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have really frizzy hair, and I was looking for a product to help me deal with it.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had much dandruff since I started using it.</li>
            <li> I would suggest trying to get a sample of this product to test on your hair before purchasing a whole bottle.</li>
            <li> and it still goes fast.</li>
            <li> It allows for you dangle so much easier.</li>
            <li> Really like this product, it seems to condition my split ends.</li>
            <li> haha.  </li>
            <li> You really should try this product.</li>
            <li> Works really well too.</li>
            <li> I really like the feel of my hair with this conditioner.  </li>
            <li> The shine is very noticeable.</li>
            <li> My husband notices it and really loves it</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s enough to keep my hair smooth.</li>
            <li> I have very frizzy damaged hair</li>
            <li> I actually really like this stuff and would buy again</li>
            <li> and  adds much needed shine.</li>
            <li> It really does give hair a silkiness.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make your hair straight or anything.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to use much to style my hair with these products.</li>
            <li> This works very well.  </li>
            <li> My hair was like straw before and after one use it feel much softer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shipping was fast, and I appreciate the company emailing me to see if I like their product.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> I was worried this would be too much moisture for me but its not at all.  </li>
            <li> I believe it has worked well with a vitamin shampoo to really strengthen my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> conditioner partners very well with &amp;#34;VITAMINS Hair Loss Shampoo&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Leaves hair soft &amp; tangle free,  but not heavy weighted like some products.</li>
            <li> though I kind of want a giant bottle of it just so it&#x27;ll last me a bit longer.</li>
            <li> the last several bottles I&#x27;ve purchased smell kind of funky.</li>
            <li> I really liked this conditioner only because of how organic it felt and how it left my hair and scalp after use.</li>
            <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t seem to accept moisture well regardless of what I use on it, but this at least gave it good slip and detangled well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did some research and found that when people have low elasticity in their hair they either do better with a natural oil like coconut oil or with protein.</li>
            <li> Since I became more conscientious about products I used in my daily life, I went on a quest for a natural shampoo and air conditioner.</li>
            <li> This conditioner, in a brief amount of time, has made my hair look and feel soft, shiny and healthy.  </li>
            <li> my hair has recovered nicely from using this product for such a short period of time.  </li>
            <li> This conditioner not only seal my ends on my hair, but it uses natural ingredients to make it smooth!</li>
            <li> My hair felt really nice, but it didn&#x27;t make it feel any nicer than when I leave it on in the shower for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a cosmetologist and the list of products I have tried is endless, but this is by far my favorite!</li>
            <li> My ends are looking better, too, but I think only a trim can make them as soft as I would like.</li>
            <li> I have tried nearly every conditioner on the market ranging from top of the line to generic brands.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ve actually got a nice even tone without having to run back to the hairdresser!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have air dried and blow dried my hair and it leaves my hair just wonderful.</li>
            <li> it seems more trouble then it&#x27;s worth, &amp;#34;It&#x27;s just conditioner guys, just finish it</li>
            <li> Nice conditioner, not too heavy.</li>
            <li> But sometimes 2 out of 5 times i felt the hair is soft but when i run my fingers through my hair it was kind of rough.</li>
            <li> old, almost sure it&#x27;ll have the same effect.  </li>
            <li> The smell is good, but not amazing:</li>
            <li> So if u are looking for s good natural conditioner without harsh chemicals</li>
            <li> conditioner works surprisingly well on my thick, frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li> No more dry scalp, soft beautiful hair!!!</li>
            <li> I am an older woman and color my hair which has always been fine, but thick and now thinning on top.</li>
            <li> It left my hair dry and full of static.</li>
            <li> I have long, highlighted hair and this conditioner is my new favorite.</li>
            <li> WOW!!!</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t believe how soft and shiny it made my hair without oil build up!!!  </li>
            <li> The softness and tangle-free state that it left my hair is nothing less than amazing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been battling my dry curly hair for decades and this is the first product I&#x27;ve found that genuinely makes a difference</li>
            <li> After using this for the very first time, I noticed a major difference in my hair texture.</li>
            <li> I could tell a difference right away, keeping my hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> For reference purposes, I have think, long, curly, easily frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> Inotherwords, it doesn&#x27;t turn my hair from blonde to brown like other products I&#x27;ve tried and does a good job of conditioning.</li>
            <li> The vanilla scent is a bit strong but does not linger long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also been known to wake up after a long night with some pretty significant &#x27;bed head&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> This conditioner makes my hair very soft and doesn&#x27;t seem dry any more.  </li>
            <li> I have been searching endlessly for an alcohol-free conditioner, safe for color and that will also help nourish my brittle and frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> I have tried many other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; brands of shampoo and conditioner with unsatisfactory results.  </li>
            <li> and I can still smell a bit of the scent hours after shampooing - with most other shampoos/conditioners, my hair just smells like hair.  </li>
            <li> We received this last week and we already see a significant improvement in her dandruff.  </li>
            <li> I am also eager to try out the shampoo products from this company now that I&#x27;ve seen what the conditioner can do; I hope there are other conditioning treatments available in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for reading about my experience, and I hope this works out as well for you as it did for me!</li>
            <li> I am also eager to try out the shampoo products from this company now that I&#x27;ve seen what the conditioner can do; I hope there are other conditioning treatments available in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for reading about my experience, and I hope this works out as well for you as it did for me!</li>
            <li> I love it and would recommend other</li>
            <li> I’ve been raving on and on about how great it smells and how a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> But, I wanted to make sure since my first purchase of this product, over a year later, I received same product for review purpose again.</li>
            <li> I do mostly co-wash for my hair and this works extremely well.</li>
            <li> I am excited to try their tea tree shampoo next and see if it can fix my scalp problem!</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m excited to see my results after I finish the entire bottle.</li>
            <li> I love how the scent seems to linger longer than other conditions.</li>
            <li> I have dropped it more than any other bottle in my shower.</li>
            <li> /&gt;long way; with other conditioners I would have to use a lot more to get any&lt;br /&gt;result.</li>
            <li> I have very long hair, and it is not always easy to take care of.  </li>
            <li> I have had my wavy caucasian hair in dreads, which were combed out a year or so ago, then white-blonde bleached and now dyed bright purple, so my hair has seriously seen some things.  </li>
            <li> As I have gotten older and damaged my hair I have not recieved much in the way of compliments.</li>
            <li> I am African American,  I did the big chop and only used natural products on my hair and this product works perfect on my hair..</li>
            <li> I have long fine hair, and this conditioner did nothing for me.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this product, I wanted to run to the computer and post a glowing review, but I decided to try it a few more days, just in case.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair, and I like to wear it long and curled.</li>
            <li> The smell is great and I only need a small amount.</li>
            <li> I have long, fine hair</li>
            <li> Not only does it fell clean</li>
            <li> It has helped my long gray, frizzy hair that is also fine.</li>
            <li> I have long fine color treated hair with lots of flyaways:</li>
            <li> It is incredibly moisturizing on my long, thick, overly processed hair.</li>
            <li> Very light weight, doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li> This was very light and didn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li> After just 2 days of using this conditioner, my hair looks silky and feels very smooth and does not weigh down with residue or leave flakes on my scalp.</li>
            <li> I have very light hair and was concerned this could weight it down or leave it oily</li>
            <li> The company offers a free product on your next order if you leave a positive review.</li>
            <li> A lot of the products for curls just end up weighing down the hair on top of my head, so that it is straight while the sides are curly.  </li>
            <li> ;) I normally awaken to a tangled, frizzy mess that looks as if it has more purpose in a birds nest than on my head.</li>
            <li> Silk 18 was the perfect solution for my very thick hair that loves to both frizz and dry out.</li>
            <li> It has a very nice vanilla scent to it and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I also very much appreciate your natural approach.</li>
            <li> I really like the scent and the product and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have thin, fine, straight hair and most conditioners</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this for myself because I was tired of buying Pantene conditioner or other brands at Rite Aid, and thought I would try this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simply: The BEST conditioner I have ever used and more natural.</li>
            <li> I love the shampoo of this type and decided to try the conditioner too, but find it&#x27;s a bit much for my fine thin hair.  </li>
            <li> Just a little bit leaves my hair soft and smooth, and the scent is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly, course, dry hair that has been lightened...leading to more dryness.  </li>
            <li> It left my hair really soft and easy to brush afterwards.</li>
            <li> It made it super soft, soft as silk.</li>
            <li> I have long, fine hair and most conditioners weigh my hair down</li>
            <li> Was expecting to make my hair silky and soft but it made it more tangled and dry.</li>
            <li> It smells mild and that&#x27;s perfect (no &amp;#34;tropical coconut&amp;#34; crap).</li>
            <li> But I googled most of them and every single one were basically natural.</li>
            <li> I have stocked up on it, as long as I can find it as cheap.</li>
            <li> the smell is fine, vanilla ,not my favorite but not strong at all only could smell it in shower not after my hair was done.  </li>
            <li> My first time trying this product I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> The smell is so nice, but not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I have to shampoo pretty frequently because of my oily scalp.</li>
            <li> It was soft and managable after the first use.</li>
            <li> they were so nice and sent me a small sample bottle to try.  </li>
            <li> I immediately ordered the full size as well as one of their shampoos and it has made such a difference.  </li>
            <li> My 9 yr old has received many compliments about how soft her hair is since using it on a regular basis.  </li>
            <li> My hair after the first use was really soft feeling, even after blow drying it.  </li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed after using the Maple Holistics shampoo &amp; conditioner was that it made my hair really soft.  </li>
            <li> As expensive as natural and organic product is it is nice to be able to just use it when I am going somewhere that I would need to do something with my hair.</li>
            <li> The best of it is only last one day, and not like other chemical brands that smell can be last forever.</li>
            <li> my hair is so soft and shiny, and it helped with the frizziness with the first use.</li>
            <li> I dye my hair frequently and this conditioner really helps to bring it out of its straw-like state!</li>
            <li> It smells terrific and left my daughters hair very shiny, silky, and smooth!</li>
            <li> From the first use my hair was soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> my hair feels alive and had body for the first time.</li>
            <li> I have a pretty sensitive nose, but this scent doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> Aloe Vera is the second ingredient, and it has botanical keratin, shea butter, pomegranate, hibiscus green tea, sea buckthorn, argan, jojoba, and most importantly, silk amino acids.</li>
            <li> I washed with my regular shampoo then applied Silk 18, put a palm full of water on my hair to help \\&quot;move\\&quot; the product throughout my hair, covering every strand.  </li>
            <li> He loved it and was surprised how it dried and looked like it has professional curls done.</li>
            <li> Let me preface by saying I have tried more conditioners than I can count on two hands (and feet!), both cheap grocery store brands and expensive beauty supply brands.</li>
            <li> naturally curly hair gets a lot of damage from highlights and I live in Florida right now..</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and many conditioners are just too heavy, causing my hair to appear flat and lifeless.  </li>
            <li> I have long, fine to normal hair, wavyish in texture.</li>
            <li> The smell is not nauseating to me, and it&#x27;s hands down a better (and cheaper) product than Wen.</li>
            <li> Hands down my favorite conditioner.</li>
            <li> But, because I don&#x27;t shampoo, if I use it too many times a week, it can start to weigh my hair down.  </li>
            <li> I would love to see the price go down a bit--maybe to the $9 mark--or</li>
            <li> the more it also weighs my hair down.</li>
            <li> I immediately noticed a positive difference but it has always been the hair conditioner that has left me still searching for the right one.  </li>
            <li> This is my new go-to conditioner!</li>
            <li> I cannot live without this!</li>
            <li> I found my new conditioner!</li>
            <li> My co-worker even asked me if I had a new product!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll make an exception for special events, but my general routine is to just wash and go (I&#x27;m a busy mom!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will update in the future if there is any significant difference in my hair after a few more months.</li>
            <li> This conditioner, is not only sulphate or any other chemical free, but also has amino acids and proteins that make my hair smooth.</li>
            <li> Silk 18 is great because it&#x27;s all natural and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling heavy and flat.</li>
            <li> I dont live in a tropical humid location, but still my hair tends to get frizzy, but has done very well with this conditioner.</li>
            <li> I live in Texas where it is very humid and this stuff fits the bill for me.</li>
            <li> I can also tell a huge difference in my itchy scalp, it is no longer dry.  </li>
            <li> Also my dry, flakey scalp has seen a huge improvement.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t shower every day nor use a bunch of products and would say that I&#x27;m on the less is more spectrum of life so this product fits the bill.</li>
            <li> and I disagree with previous reviewers that say the scent is overwhelming.</li>
            <li> In addition, using this combination of products is saving me so much more time because I&#x27;m washing my hair a lot less.</li>
            <li> so I love using it for that reason alone, but it also conditions so well and without having to use half the bottle.</li>
            <li> It has made my hair so much more manageable in terms of smoother and less tangled.</li>
            <li> I love the texture and slight vanilla smell of the Silk 18 conditioner and how silky it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li> After a month and a half I continue seeing improvement and feel much better.  </li>
            <li> I can immediately feel a difference when using it, and my hair has become much less oily and curls better.</li>
            <li> My hair was absolutely more silky/shiny and had less frizz.  </li>
            <li> I felt my hair was still dry and not silky or smooth at all.</li>
            <li> but then I could use less and use it more often.  </li>
            <li> I have always been sceptical about products that say they moisturize, mostly because I never found one that did even half the job it says it would.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely stay loyal to this conditioner .</li>
            <li> I am now using only organic or natural products and their products fit the bill.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the main reason I started using these</li>
            <li> Secondly, it leaves my hair really soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I am definitely going to buy more of this in the future.</li>
            <li> I spent many days to find another natural hair products</li>
            <li> The shape of the curls themselves aren&#x27;t very consistent at all, and the silhouette of the style is unusual (flat in some places, voluminous in others).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This literally transformed my hair after only one use, love this product and will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> and I had used many different conditioners and detangling products on her hair prior to Silk 18.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m seriously never wasting my time on another conditioner again.</li>
            <li> I will seriously never use another conditioner again.</li>
            <li> and my hair is still the same, soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> The second time i applied much more and in layers buti still had the same problem just not as severe.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s decently moisturizing but not at all greasy.</li>
            <li> when I say it was exactly like after that first wash; strands simply ran from my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I recently got this as a present and really love the way it feels on my hair.</li>
            <li> Overall, I was most definitely 5-star</li>
            <li> It smells great and a small amount goes a long wait.  </li>
            <li> Leaves hair soft and shiny following your fantastic shampoo.</li>
            <li> I would not pay more than $10.77 for this size bottle of this product and wouldn&#x27;t even have looked at it if it was more expensive.</li>
            <li> We emailed back and forth several times as I had questions about which shampoo would most benefit my hair/scalp as I have itchy, flaky issues.  </li>
            <li> I made a career of it and got used to short hair and kept it short for many years.</li>
            <li> My main filter is the Pelican I purchased on Amazon and the Vitamin c shower head filter I purchased on anther online store, but they do sell them on Amazon.    </li>
            <li> People with a similar hair type I imagine would have similar results :).&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wish it came in a larger bottle as I will be purchasing more in the future.  </li>
            <li> This product tamed my super frizzy hair with a lasting vanilla scent.</li>
            <li> It is nice smelling, fairly thick, and really conditions well.</li>
            <li> and when I take out my twist my is back soft and tangle free.</li>
            <li> Has a very subtle vanilla smell to it and definitely the best conditioner i have used so far.</li>
            <li> Great product I&#x27;ve decided to go natural and stop putting unhealthy stuff in my hair so it can grow stronger and fuller</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of vanilla scent so its particularly obnoxious to me.</li>
            <li> I am happy to recommend SILK 18 to anyone with similar conditions or just as a soothing after shampoo treatment for delicate hair.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a natural conditioner that actually leaves my hair knot-free and silky smooth.  </li>
            <li> I just bought this item recently and I have to say it&#x27;s fabulous, leaves my hair feeling hydrated but not heavy</li>
            <li> (By the way, I&#x27;m about to purchase my fourth bottle, so the results do appear rather quickly.)  </li>
            <li> As I said before, I&#x27;ve only used it once, but already my hair feels soft to the touch, light, moisturized, not greasy AND</li>
            <li> The older</li>
            <li> However I didn&#x27;t particularly care for the smell.</li>
            <li> I like that its a decent price.</li>
            <li> If nothing else I would say to try these products worry free as they are true to their word and will refund your money if you are not satisfied.</li>
            <li> It detangled my fine hair and left it silky smooth without weighing it down.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this conditioner to any person that is looking for a change in their hair treatment or just looking for a new conditioner!</li>
            <li> very well - my hair is very soft</li>
            <li> My hair is very fine and curly, and I usually don&#x27;t have to do much to get the tangles out.</li>
            <li> Makes my fine and &amp;#34;too often straightened with a flat iron&amp;#34; hair seem soft.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that this is a natural conditioner so that and all the positive reviews are what made me purchase it along with the argan shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I have short hair (above my shoulders) and I have to use a lot more of this product than I normally do.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for a couple weeks now, and my hair is much shinier and soft and all around healthier!</li>
            <li> My hair never feels very soft until now!</li>
            <li> Love that the ingredient list is readable and not full of synthetics.</li>
            <li> Both my goals were accomplished and now my hair is silky soft and tamed!</li>
            <li> A friendly company goes a long way in my book.</li>
            <li> The scent is of vanilla and almonds, sweet but not overpowering, so you actually like how it leaves a soft and gentle aroma.</li>
            <li> Not only are the ingredients safe, but my hair is super soft and smooth after only a few weeks of using.</li>
            <li> My hair is silky smooth and my scalp isn&#x27;t dry and flaky like it normally is this time of year.</li>
            <li> I really think this stuff is just full of chemicals, it has to be to dry my hair out like that</li>
            <li> Wonderful scent, leaves hair as shiny and soft as my most expensive deep conditioning treatments ( e.g. Lush&#x27;s Fluff-ease) and doesn&#x27;t weigh down my long, straight fine hair at all.</li>
            <li> in all, I would wholeheartedly recommend this conditioner to anyone with wavy-curly hair, or just more generally, to anyone with dry hair.</li>
            <li> The smell is a pleasant vanilla and not overpowering and you only need to use a small amount of conditioner, as it is so concentrated.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Wish price wasn&#x27;t so high</li>

            <li> I HIGHLY recommend getting this</li>
            <li> By the way, If You have issues with dandruff, the Sage shampoo is another product I would highly recommend you try.</li>
            <li> After using Silk 18, I highly doubt I will try anything else.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> , I highly recommend you try this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone who deals with tangles.</li>
            <li> I have seen a huge improvement in my dry, brittle ends!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t expect any naturally based product to magically make me have movie star hair, but it has made it soooo much smoother and less tangled</li>
            <li> On the other hand, it really doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel silky smooth.  </li>
            <li> Smells better than other natural conditioners.</li>
            <li> I can finally find a product that is both natural and works effectively to seal my dry ends.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is a little better than other conditioners I have used because my hair is not limp, but I will continue searching for a better conditioner for my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to paying a little more for high quality products and ingredients, so I understand it,</li>
            <li> It made my hair feel very soft and did a good job of detangling my thick, naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li> I might also add that certain products cause me to have rashes and redness, so I am switching to organic, 100% natural products.</li>
            <li> My hair is super soft , shiny, and full, without being weighed down .</li>
            <li> So far I like the smell even though it&#x27;s not something I&#x27;d usually pick, but after using it my hair is smooth and easy to comb through and soft the rest of the day.</li>
            <li> I have recently purchased this conditioner for the first time and have seen an immediate change in the manageability of my hair!  </li>
            <li> It left my hair feeling silky and shiny after the first use!  </li>
            <li> I just wish it gave my hair a little more body.  </li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel really soft!!</li>
            <li> I combine this with another conditioner that is a little heavier to keep my hair more manageable.</li>
            <li> I noticed a major difference even after the first use.  </li>
            <li> WOW!!</li>
            <li> I also tried their argan oil shampoo and it is equally amazing-leaves the hair clean, but soft.</li>
            <li> It left my hair feeling clean (no residue), soft, manageable, and silky as the name states.</li>
            <li> Often I&#x27;ve tried natural shampoos being careful to steer clear of all the chemicals in most shampoos/conditioners, and been less than satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> I have a lot fine, long blond hair and my old shampoo was too drying.</li>
            <li> I live in a very dry climate and I have been looking for a conditioner that would help my fine hair to be moisturized but not too greasy.</li>
            <li> I have tried many chemical free hair products a lot more expensive, and nothing even compares!!  </li>
            <li> Before trying this amazing product my hair was dull and I decided to go homeopathic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so so many things to get my fine, thin, highlighted hair to feel soft again</li>
            <li> but like some other reviews the fragrance is a bit strong on the vanilla side, but nothing that would make me Not buy the product.</li>
            <li> Other reviews remarked that it was too strong.  </li>
            <li> Kind of hard not getting on my scalp</li>
            <li> They left my hair feeling clean and smooth, without looking oily or weighed down.</li>
            <li> It has a creamy feel and texture like a &amp;#34;traditional conditioner&amp;#34;, detangles and smooths my fine hair well without weighing it down, makes my scalp and head feel and smell amazing (like Vanilla; it&#x27;s not overwhelming</li>
            <li> so I my hair isn&#x27;t going to look amazing (at least to me),</li>
            <li> and I know that not all professional products really work for ever hair type.</li>
            <li> I am sensitive to smells but the smell isn&#x27;t so overpowering to make you sneeze the whole time.</li>
            <li> My hair is much softer than before and it seems that the frequent loss of hair is coming to an end.</li>
            <li> She has thick course red hair and this conditioner has amazing results!  </li>
            <li> In addition to the way this product makes my hair feel, I also like the idea that the product is gentle, and uses natural and sometimes organic ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I really do not believe this is silicone free and &amp;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so sold on this whole line because they use natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> The price is reasonable for a natural conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> It really tames frizz and makes my hair so soft and silky.</li>
            <li> I really like the silk18 conditioner, one for the natural ingredients</li>
            <li> Today my hair is so soft and shiny and very manageable.</li>
            <li> hair is fine, half-wavy, tangles easily, and is still recovering from a lot of color and bleach damage from some poor choices.</li>
            <li> really can&#x27;t believe that this stuff works so well and is made from natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I really like the conditioning properties to this natural conditioner.</li>
            <li> and so far I don&#x27;t notice as much of a difference as others have.</li>
            <li> I figured I found a great solution, but was mistakenly wrong.</li>
            <li> Also leaves my baby fine (but terribly dry) hair feeling soft and smoothe.</li>
            <li> So far I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had a soft and straight hair and</li>
            <li> I can tell a huge difference between the two, and now I am thinking that it would actually be worth it to keep buying this one despite its small size and cost.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair soft and very shinny.  </li>
            <li> It stands up to its name &#x27;Silk&#x27; and really makes my hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair extremely soft and look much healthier.</li>
            <li> It make my hair so soft, really touchable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just make my hair smooth as I expected.</li>
            <li> have natural curly hair that I have struggled with my whole life</li>
            <li> So far I really like this conditioner-</li>
            <li> but my hair is very silky and soft.</li>
            <li> I have to use quite a bit of it to really get my hair conditioned, but I frequently do use a lot with all conditioners.  </li>
            <li> However, when I try natural shampoos they are very hit and miss.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft and very shining without all the chemicals.</li>
            <li> It is all natural and really shows.</li>
            <li> It leaves even my combination Brillo/Buffalo hair soft and very well moisturized.</li>
            <li> Worth a shot with the money back guarantee.</li>
            <li> It is gentle enough to use on the whole family!</li>
            <li> and my hair has actually looked better around the second and third day than it does on the first</li>
            <li> I normally had to deal with.</li>
            <li> but i&#x27;d say this is worth the extra money.  </li>
            <li> and I love that it is not filled with toxic chemicals.</li>
            <li> It smells like vanilla, and you can leave it on your hair for a few minutes while you shave, and your hair comes out silky smooth!</li>
            <li> My hair was so healthy after 2 years of doing nothing to it but always limp and lacked body.  </li>
            <li> I used to use volumizing conditioner from Big Sexy Hair and alternate with Ion&#x27;s Deep Repair Conditioner for color-treated hair, but results weren&#x27;t really consistent.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product to others and it is worth the buy.</li>
            <li> I wasted my money, since I won&#x27;t be able to tolerate the smell.</li>
            <li> I have crazy hair that needs to be blown out or straightened, and it dries on its own with Silk 18, looking soft and healthy.</li>
            <li> My hair is so dried out and thinning on top.</li>
            <li> I love the shampoo and will be purchasing it again, but this product seemed to heavy for my hair.  </li>
            <li> I reviewed all the comments and saw how much people love it, and my friend let me use a small amount of hers.</li>
            <li> I love that it conditions so fully, without leaving my hair limp or greasy.</li>
            <li> I should get my hair trimmed more regularly, but it&#x27;s such a pain finding a reasonably-priced stylist, who also knows how to deal with curly hair, that I tend to judge when I need to bite the bullet and get a cut, by when my ends become completely unmanageable and</li>
            <li> I normally use Deva products, but wanted to switch things up.  </li>
            <li> I had a noticeable line where my natural ash blonde was hitting the more brassy, dyed blonde that was bleached lighter from the brown hair dye phase.  </li>
            <li> Not one who normally likes a vanilla scent</li>
            <li> I use a few products and simply love them all.</li>
            <li> It dried my hair out and made it more damaged than before.</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t write Amazon reviews, but I wasn&#x27;t a fan of this conditioner.</li>
            <li> The only reason I did not give it a 5 star is because I have not tried it that long and want to make sure it keeps</li>
            <li> I was using normal conditioners before this and after just one use I could feel and see a difference in the softness and shininess of my hair.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth the extra cost for the result.  </li>
            <li> the only drawback was the amount of conditioner, but it&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li> I just received it yesterday and tried it for the first time today and WOW sooo soft very manageable with a light feel for such a deep conditioner.  </li>
            <li> The good thing is the silky feeling didn&#x27;t last long as well but leaves my hair soft until next wash.</li>
            <li> Just rinse out lightly as it doesn&#x27;t really weigh hair down.</li>
            <li> I have long, very fine blonde hair with a natural wave.</li>
            <li> I love it and would highly recommend to anyone who needs to tame their hair.</li>
            <li> The second is that after applying it on my hair,quality of my hair is getting better, which i mean is silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> In other words, I have a lot of fine hair.</li>
            <li> and I think that works 100% better than this, for half the price no less!</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s not to love?&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use this conditioner, and came back to buy a bottle for my daughter whose hair is very wavy, long, tangles easily and is damaged from years of coloring.</li>
            <li> I have naturally coiled typed hair and live in a very humid environment</li>
            <li> Nothing special, my hair stays dry and unmanageable after using this product.</li>
            <li> This product actually caused my hair to become more dry.</li>
            <li> I then towel dry my hair and apply more from the mid section of my hair to the ends like a leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for more than a month and my hair - which is wavy and tends to be dry and frizzy - is definitely softer.</li>
            <li> This is great for thick curly dry hair.</li>
            <li> and how it made my hair super soft for the next 2-3 days.</li>
            <li> only criticism is that my hair is left smelling a bit like a sugar cookie with the strong Vanilla scent.  </li>
            <li> After using it a few more times, my hair has only continued to look and feel better - even now in the winter where I&#x27;m around dry radiator heat all day! -</li>
            <li> So the right “conditioner&amp;#34; is critical.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this stuff and suggest giving it time if you don&#x27;t see results right away.</li>
            <li> I bought this conditioner because I loved that all the ingredients have a low rating on skin deep, and my all natural shampoo was leaving ym hair very dry.  </li>
            <li> full of tangles, dry, frizzy.</li>
            <li> My hair isn&#x27;t super long, but it tangles a lot.</li>
            <li> I am also happy to use something in my hair what is not full with harsh chemicals.  </li>
            <li> I noticed from doing this my hair is becoming less frizzy.</li>
            <li> This conditioner was able to tame my mane.</li>
            <li> I would love to see larger batches made available at a bulk discount for serious customers.</li>
            <li> was very excited for this product, hoping it would help with my damaged hair, but ive found that applying coconut oil and shea butter to the ends of my hair after a shower worked the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dont waste your money, or if you do buy it on ebay new for $13.</li>
            <li> Worth giving a shot though, as it seems to make your hair manageable without putting a bunch of fake chemicals into it and definitely works better than cheap conditioners.</li>
            <li> Well, it&#x27;s dry right now as I type and am absolutely amazed by it.</li>
            <li> Well, it&#x27;s dry right now as I type and am absolutely amazed by it.</li>
            <li> I have very coarse and dry hair, and I&#x27;ve tried one too many natural conditioners from Whole Foods and Lush, with no results.</li>
            <li> The conditioner distributes easily throughout hair without leaving it feeling weighed down or greasy.</li>
            <li> I also get migraines and some strong smells really bother me, and this is not strong smelling at all.</li>
            <li> I can even use this conditioner on my roots, which I normally don&#x27;t do, as it isn&#x27;t heavy and rinses very clean, even in my softened well water.</li>
            <li> and I can even go without gel or any other styling products if I want which is a huge bonus for me.  </li>
            <li> Using this silk 18 conditioner in conjunction with this hair mask every other washing http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00I32AN4K/ref&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o05_s00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1 has made a huge difference in the texture and health of my hair.  </li>
            <li> which what other conditioners cause to my hair) and it made it really smooth.</li>
            <li> I wanted to move to sulfate free products to protect my hair color and found Maple Holistics and I won&#x27;t be using any other products on my hair.</li>
            <li> This product makes my hair feel smooth compared to other conditioners.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very user friendly.</li>
            <li> Also, my scalp and nearby skin (neck, face, and upper back) are happy: no more itching or breakouts.  </li>
            <li> The end result was soft and a little more manageable.</li>
            <li> After rinsing out my old shampoo, I applied a quarter size of this conditioner throughout the body of my hair and then a little more at the ends.  </li>
            <li> I have fine hair, but a lot of it, so it&#x27;s hard to find just the right conditioner.</li>
            <li> love that all of these products are economical, and a little seems to go a very long way.</li>
            <li> Ordering today again a new supply from them.</li>
            <li> New staple conditioner.</li>
            <li> I tend to invest regularly in new hair products, so</li>
            <li> I look forward to my new hair journey with this product.</li>
            <li> My new fav..</li>
            <li> I am adding this new comment...</li>
            <li> I live this conditioner.</li>
            <li> This is one of my new favorites.</li>
            <li> I had never heard of the brand before but was looking for a new conditioner and decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for a new conditioner/shampoo since I DESTROYED my hair using the &#x27;on sale&#x27; shampoos/conditioners...</li>
            <li> I am always looking for new shampoos and conditioners to try.  </li>
            <li> Depending where you live they could be using Chlorine,Chloramines or Monochloramines to purify the water.</li>
            <li> At this point, I had been using Tresemme&#x27;s curly hair conditioner for years, but decided it was time to test out new hair products, to see if that could help with this issue.</li>
            <li> This is my new line of hair products.</li>
            <li> Since using this conditioner,about 7 weeks,my scalp and hair have felt like new.</li>
            <li> We live in Hawaii and my daughter swims in chlorinated pools all week in addition to lots of sun and saltwater exposure.  </li>
            <li> I live in Kentucky where the water contains a lot of calcium.</li>
            <li> It has a very strong scent of vanilla, which I am not a fan of, but seems to be getting milder, the further down the bottle I go.</li>
            <li> 8 oz bottle lasted about a month and a half, not bad!</li>
            <li> A lot of other natural beauty companies claim their products are amazing, when they&#x27;re really not, but I was very statisfied with my purchase here.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and live in a very dry climate, so it is hard to keep my hair healthy.</li>
            <li> I have been using this and it has made my hair feel better than other high end brands that I have tried such as Living Proof, Alterna, Color Proof, Redken, etc</li>
            <li> I have dry thin caucasian hair, and the first time I used it, the difference was truly remarkable.</li>
            <li> I did however send it back because I recently went fragrance free</li>
            <li> I tried using it in various ways, especially because I enjoy the smell.</li>
            <li> It has a nice, subtle smell.</li>
            <li> Anyway, after only my second use, my girlfriend complimented me on my smooth shiny hair.</li>
            <li> My 8 month old was born with a head full of long hair that I needed to start conditioning when she was a newborn.</li>
            <li> My whole family wants to know my hair care routine because of how different my hair looks.</li>
            <li> I just received this last week and have natural wavy hair (i have dyed for years) but do not use heating irons, curling  or even blow dry more than 2-3 times a week TOPS.</li>
            <li> I only wish there was a larger size available.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is kind of expensive but worth</li>
            <li> Before changing over to the better quality shampoo I had been using the bargain basement shampoo from target for a long long time.</li>
            <li> A few months ago I decided I am going to let it grow out again and have a pony tail like most of the old retirees I see around.  </li>
            <li> so my hair is super dry from the sun.  </li>
            <li> Along with a whole foods diet I have also been swapping out all my old chemical laden beauty and hair care products to natural products.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product mainly because it has natural ingredients in it</li>
            <li> but for free sure ill try it why not.</li>
            <li> I also loved the smell, very subtle vanilla scent.</li>
            <li> Also the fragrance of this conditioner is so pleasant and natural unlike the fake intense floral hair product out there.</li>
            <li> I love how NATURALLY soft my hair feels when I get out of the shower, versus full of junk that doesn&#x27;t wash out properly and leaves my hair dull.</li>
            <li> I have to be careful of conditioners too, because while I want smoothness and shine, and easy wet-combing, most conditioners weigh my hair down and make it look flat, even though I know not to put it on my scalp.</li>
            <li> and after my hair is very soft.</li>
            <li> phase if this will work for my very sensitive scalp (hoping it will).</li>
            <li> this made it very soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I was actually very surprised with the results.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair very soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> It made my hair very soft and shiny, as well.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair very soft.  </li>
            <li> This stuff made my hair very soft, with a feeling like a toddler&#x27;s hair.  </li>
            <li> Leaves hair very soft, shiny and silky feeling...</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair very soft</li>
            <li> Not only are thousands and thousands of larvae killed in the process but silk worms have been inbred for so long that they cannot fly anymore and do not exist in the wild.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my hair very soft and silky.  </li>
            <li> This conditioner has a very natural vanilla scent to it that does not bother me at all.</li>
            <li> Also, I am very sensitive to EVERTHING</li>
            <li> My hair is very soft and shiny when I use it.</li>
            <li> I used this product along with purador shampoo and after using this my hairs feel very soft.</li>
            <li> Silk 18 leaves my hair very soft, silky, and manageable, and i can go out without straightening my hair often.</li>
            <li> but it does make my 4c hair very very soft.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair very soft, and the smell is like vanilla almonds.</li>
            <li> It made my hair very soft, silky, and manageable.</li>
            <li> it is very soft.</li>
            <li> hair is very soft and silky - and after 2 uses now, the dryness (friz) is about 90 percent gone.</li>
            <li> its very natural</li>
            <li> My daughter has eczema and very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair very soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair very soft.</li>
            <li> and it leaves it very  soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I am highly endorsing this products to all my natural and non-natural friends.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many conditioners, but most left my hair weighted down, limp, and/or oily.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never instantly had, detangled, soft bouncy curls right out of the shower.</li>
            <li> but it was so strong and full of chemicals that it started irritating my skin.</li>
            <li> It hard to find natural products with a good price and actually work!!</li>
            <li> I have fine hair that is wavy, and I usually use conditioner from 100 percent pure, but now I&#x27;ve been alternating between this and</li>
            <li> I have very curly and coarse hair, and Silk 18 Natural Conditioner seems to be keeping it more manageable , less frizzy, and softer.  </li>
            <li> My hair felt very soft after the first use and the vanilla scent was lasting!</li>
            <li> And from the very first use, my hair has felt softer, less frizzy and 100% more manageable than with any other natural hair care product I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even need to blow dry or flat iron after washing (which is pretty much always necessary for a smooth style on my hair).</li>
            <li> My hair was not a tangled mess after I washed it, its softer than it usually is, and this conditioner has a great scent.</li>
            <li> Recently started growing out my hair into a mini-fro for the first time.</li>
            <li> Leaves my (silver)  hair silky soft!</li>
            <li> first time I used this conditioner I used it alone since I wanted to get a sense of its mousturizing capabilities so after washing my hair with the sage shampoo of the same brand and after apllying it</li>
            <li> My hair was soft, silky, and shinny!  </li>
            <li> The only downside is the price, but with all the benefits it has, I&#x27;m willing to pay for it.</li>
            <li> It may work better for other people, but overall I give it four stars.</li>
            <li> This is much better than the usual Pantene conditioner, or the drugstore hair conditioners I&#x27;ve used before.  </li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed was obviously the smell.</li>
            <li> I also use it on my 5 yr old daughter&#x27;s hair, and it leaves it gleaming!</li>
            <li> This seemed to work okay, but not as well as my other deep conditioners.  </li>
            <li> I tried this on my AA hair and wow!</li>
            <li> all natural  ingredients  and selling fast as my  sister  wants but it currently  </li>
            <li> After using this natura solution my hair completely changed and the difference was noticeable!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe this can be natural!</li>
            <li> I have never used something that makes my hair feel so silky and soft!</li>
            <li> Second, it really works!  </li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner made my hair so soft!</li>
            <li> This is extremely moisturizing and has a rich vanilla scent, which my husband likes.</li>
            <li> This conditioner made my hair feel so soft!</li>
            <li> You also can&#x27;t beat the fact that it is 100% natural and under $15!</li>
            <li> I applied a small amount and tapped it on top of my head</li>
            <li> I am pleasantly surprised by this conditioner!</li>
            <li> And wow!</li>
            <li> So far I am liking it!</li>
            <li> It made my hair so soft!</li>
            <li> After the first use there was an obvious change!</li>
            <li> and she said it made her hair soft and reduced the appearance &amp; feel of damage!</li>
            <li> Most other conditioner advise to only apply to the ends of the hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is so shiny and soft!  </li>
            <li> After my first use my hair has a silkiness it only has after being at the hair salon.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my hair feeling soft and touchable!</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair, and this reduced the frizz in just one wash!</li>
            <li> $16 for a conditioner that lasts about a month is pretty steep, but I have been alternating its use with a regular brand of conditioner.</li>
            <li> Plus so natural!</li>
            <li> I also purchased the sage shampoo which is cleansing but not harsh on my color treated hair!</li>
            <li> WOW!  </li>
            <li> Leaves my hair silky and soft for days!</li>
            <li> WOW!  </li>
            <li> Only gave it 4 stars because this was my first use</li>
            <li> This conditioner has made my hair so soft !</li>
            <li> I was looking for a natural conditioner and found it!</li>
            <li> , therefore naturally prone to frizzy and fuzzy looking!  </li>
            <li> Sometimes I prefer to use hair products which usually target a more feminine &#x27;audience&#x27;.</li>
            <li> This completely damaged my hair to the extent that I could&#x27;t use any heat utensils like my blow dryer, straightener, etc because my hair would just literally burn off!</li>
            <li> I bought this along with the sage shampoo...perfect combination for sensitive scalp and no build up!</li>
            <li> I have tried countless products for my hair and this is the first time</li>
            <li> It was the softest it has ever been while using Silk18, my curls were soft and not frizzy, and required no leave-in product whatsoever!</li>
            <li> My hair is so soft!</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I am excited to try their other products too</li>
            <li> my hair felt so soft and looked shiny!</li>
            <li> I straighten it daily, so its pretty damaged as well.</li>
            <li> I first tried this after using a friend&#x27;s conditioner when I ran out last year, but I never got around to buying it because I forgot what the brand was.</li>
            <li> My first purchase and the above review was from 2014</li>
            <li> It is soft and I can&#x27;t stop running my hands through it!  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair so soft and shiny!</li>
            <li> Sticking to a low poo regimen and using this twice a week made my hair exactly how I&#x27;ve always wanted it to be:</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair shiny, soft and well hydrated!</li>
            <li> Makes my hair soft and silky!</li>
            <li> And, WOW!  </li>
            <li> My hair is now shiny for the first time in 3 years, my split ends are almost all gone (after second use)</li>
            <li> it made my hair as soft as my girlfriends!</li>
            <li> Her hair is so soft that I purchased another bottle for myself!</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m sitting in bed typing this having used the product for the first time last night with my hair softer than its been since I was a baby (I assume).  </li>
            <li> Hair was so soft, silky, and shiny after just one use!</li>
            <li> My hair is really soft and shiny!</li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair (mid-back length) and generally need a great deal of conditioner to even get the knots out.  </li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> After using it the first time, my hair went from straw to silk instantly...</li>
            <li> First used and instant results.  </li>
            <li> I usually have a lot of issues with tangling and frizz, but this made it a lot better.</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> safe.)&lt;br /&gt;Anyway... My only issue with this product is that they need to make a body lotion, or even a matching shampoo with this exact scent.  </li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I received the Silk18 conditioner in the mail yesterday and used it last night for the first time.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much for making a natural conditioner that actually works!!!</li>
            <li> My hair has never felt so silky soft before!</li>
            <li> so I try to stay away from the normal sulfate shampoos and instead use these kinds with natural oils and ingredients.</li>
            <li> Boy, was I surprised!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried various products and this has been consistent perfection.</li>
            <li> I put on the conditioner and left it in for a few minutes and my hair softened up a good bit, but it did not feel silky and it left me with lots of tangles to get out.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first time my hair actually feels clean and though my hair was left still a bit pouffy, it was definitely softer and felt lighter.</li>
            <li> It smells artificial and un-natural and just WAY too strong!!!</li>
            <li> Has the clean smell and viscosity of much more expensive, un-natural conditioners, but it Natural!</li>
            <li> It smells amazing, though subtle, and makes my aging hair soft, silky and shinier than it&#x27;s been in a decade.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have been on the hunt for an all natural conditioner for my super curly, dry hair for a while now.  </li>
            <li> and smooth, without being weighed down.  </li>
            <li> It also made my hair feel light and not weighed down.  </li>
            <li> I would not say frizz free, however, the frizz does die down for 2-3 days.</li>
            <li> It makes my frizzy damaged hair silk smooth without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> My hair tends to frizz quite a bit, and this conditioner makes my hair feel really smooth without weighing it down</li>
            <li> It does not weigh down my hair or leave any build up, which is important since I have issues with dandruff/psoriasis/itching.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair smooth without tangles and it does not weigh it down.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to try this conditioner, based on all the great reviews, but also a little skeptical.  </li>
            <li> Not only does it smell amazing, my hair looks shinier, feels softer, and didn’t take as long to dry.</li>
            <li> I also developed a little issue with my scalp becoming oily the day after washing my hair</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair, but it is thick.</li>
            <li> I have very fine but thick hair.</li>
            <li> Being a guy with wavy, &amp;#34;poofy&amp;#34; hair, I&#x27;ve always found it near impossible to find some kind of shampoo/conditioner that keeps my hair from drying out and becoming &amp;#34;poofier&amp;#34; as the day wares on.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick and fuzzy hair, after applying this conditioner, my hair becomes smooth and easy to comb.</li>
            <li> Really nice conditioner, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have recently purchased this conditioner based on the reviews - being skeptical I wasn&#x27;t so sure if it would be effective or not, this is my second time using it</li>
            <li> product has made my high volume, naturally wavy, fine hair (read: shrivels and dries up at the flick of a straightener switch) soft and easy to tame without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to the world of natural hair products and have heard horror stories.</li>
            <li> My hair got so silky that now it&#x27;s kind of hard to control them!</li>
            <li> but it may have to do with the free product you get if you write a good review :-(</li>
            <li> The vanilla smell initially seems like it might be a bit much, but once you wash it out, it leaves a nice, subtle fragrance.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t like vanilla scent in beauty products, but it&#x27;s so light that it doesn&#x27;t bother me too much.  </li>
            <li> my fine hair had turned really dry and frizzy with the product I was using, so i went on Amazon looking for a deep conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have long naturally straight hair that responds very well to this conditioner.  </li>
            <li> My hair is nearly waist length, slightly wavy and fine</li>
            <li> It is definitely worth a try if you suffer from dry hair like I do.</li>
            <li> I am almost completely flake free now, and my red, dry scalp has returned to normal.</li>
            <li> It is not too heavy, leaving your hair easy to style.</li>
            <li> In the past I have always found either the consistency of natural conditioners to be off (typically more runny than what I prefer)</li>
            <li> Feels like normal conditioner, doesn&#x27;t do much for my hair (asian).</li>
            <li> and I think my family prefers it far more than the apple cider vinegar rinses I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> then blue, which of course meant i needed to bleach my hair first because naturally I&#x27;m a brunette.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really NOT into super &amp;#34;feminine&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> yodaughter has thick tangly long hair which needs good conditioner.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very thick</li>
            <li> This was taken after using Aussie shampoo/conditioner, letting my hair dry on its own for a little under an hour, and then using a diffuser to finish drying it.</li>
            <li> I have used many other products such as Clear and Pantene but they don&#x27;t nearly compare to this.</li>
            <li> I often have issues with conditioners leaving my hair feeling weighed down, but as soon as I rinsed it out, my hair felt light soft.</li>
            <li> I have shortish fine hair, did not help unravel my little tangles</li>
            <li> I have very thick, wavy, frizzy hair, so it was a surprise that it made it so smooth so quickly.</li>
            <li> It rinses clean unlike other natural conditioner&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I accidentally came across this product and read the reviews which turn out to be terrific and amazingly positive.</li>
            <li> I recently ordered this product after reading positive reviews on here.</li>
            <li> Transformed my fine, dry, color treated frizz back into soft, shiny, silky strands.  </li>
            <li> I have been natural for about 4 years and my natural 4a/4b hair loves this product as a leave-in conditioner!</li>
            <li> That being said, I LOVED the way this product left my hair feeling healthier and looking less dry and frizzy!</li>
            <li> She has thin mostly straight hair, and it reflected light really well after using this!</li>
            <li> In the last year, I have been diligently looking for a sulfate free conditioner for my 62-year old, long, mostly-dark brown hair.</li>
            <li> have not used this long enough to know if I Love it, but for the last week I have used it I do like it</li>
            <li> The only product that could get my hair soft prior to this was l&#x27;oreal&#x27;s  everpure conditioning mask, but that is full of chemicals.</li>
            <li> Yes I over process my blonde locks but also life changes have made for less hormones and more dryness.</li>
            <li> I have very coarse dry hair and stumbled upon this conditioner when searching for sulfate free shampoo.</li>
            <li> After trying waaaaayyy too many conditioners, I had finally resolved myself to an over the counter brand that if I used half cup at a time, I could manage to work through and detangle my hair in about 10 minutes in the shower.  </li>
            <li> The product worked very, and left my hair very soft.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for straight hair, but didn&#x27;t work well enough for us in the long run on my husband&#x27;s curly hair (whose problem with his unmanageable curly hair is the reason behind why we bought this product).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My husband and I have been using this conditioner for over eight times so far and have definitely noticed smoother and more shining hair for both of us (long and short hairs).</li>
            <li> Tried it right away since my hair was so dry.</li>
            <li> I am so excited to try all the other hair products from this line!</li>
            <li> excited to try out all of the other Maple Holistics products!</li>
            <li> I am really excited to try Maple Holistics&#x27; other products!</li>
            <li> I wish it was larger especially since I have to use more product since I have very long hair.</li>
            <li> This conditioner relieved my dry itchy scalp and left my hair really smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> Seems too heavy for my fine hair</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I prefer more floral or fruity scents when it comes to hair products, but don&#x27;t you worry, it is not a deal breaker here!</li>
            <li> It is not too heavy or greasy for my ultra fine hair.</li>
            <li> As far as application - it has a nice, thick consistency, yet it spreads nicely through my long, thick hair.</li>
            <li> Several years ago, I realized how damaging certain chemicals were to my hair and skin</li>
            <li> obviously I would go more, but time and money are both tight.</li>
            <li> I have extremely thick hair and this conditioner was so gentle and made my hair feel so light and soft!</li>
            <li> I have very long, wavy hair with lots of grey covered by home coloring that tends to frizz easily.</li>
            <li> My hair is straight and fine but has never reacted negatively to conditioner before.</li>
            <li> I dry shampoo every other day which has caused some dry flakiness to occur on my scalp all around my face and right a the top of my hair.</li>
            <li> Nice smelling &amp; very thick.</li>
            <li> Tried on my colored, wavy, shoulder length hair, my teen&#x27;s very long and super thick straight hair, and my toddler&#x27;s long baby fine curly hair, all with success.</li>
            <li> A co-worker of mine recommended this product to me and with all this frizzy coarse curly mixed hair I&#x27;m always willing to try ANYTHING!  </li>
            <li> I will be 45 in a couple of weeks and have bleached my hair most of my life so it tends to get mousy and dull and dry/brittle</li>
            <li> It is hard to find healthy alternatives for a lot of the products out there.</li>
            <li> Good but a little heavy for</li>
            <li> I originally purchased two bottles of the Argan Oil Shampoo and was not a fan, since it left my hair bit to dry.  </li>
            <li> use Silk 18 as a conditioner and leave it in for about 5 minutes before rinsing out and have noticed a significant improvement in the softness in my hair and also, my dry scalp is starting to subside!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I let my hair air dry and for the first time in years, my hair was actually soft!</li>
            <li> I have dry damaged hair due to coloring my hair for many years.</li>
            <li> The way it made my hair feel is unbelievable, I have tried so many high end conditioners, deep conditioners, and hair masques and now of them compare to this!</li>
            <li> I have ethnic hair, so my hair is very thick and curly, since using the conditioner, it has left my hair soft every time and smells good.  </li>
            <li> I never find it leaves my hair dry or brittle, which I can say has been the result with many other natural brands.</li>
            <li> It makes a huge difference if you can leave it on for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> on the bottle it says &amp;#34;Complimented with soft natural vanilla undertones&amp;#34; I might not know what natural vanilla smells like because this smelled like a vanilla car freshener- like on of the trees you can hang in your car.</li>
            <li> Not only did it feel amazingly soft, it also made it really really shiny.</li>
            <li> It left my hair feeling extremely soft, shiny, and very healthy--which is saying a lot considering I fried the living daylights out of it by bleaching it.</li>
            <li> My husband got this for me for Christmas because I am very picky with my products (I want then as natural as possible).</li>
            <li> but he is bald so clearly would never need this</li>
            <li> I have hi-lighted hair and it has made it so soft and</li>
            <li> I’m always searching and trying natural products (make-up, hair, vitamins, etc).</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft, shiny, and manageable.</li>
            <li> I searched for a natural conditioner and Silk 18 came up</li>
            <li> but so far my hair is silky and soft.</li>
            <li> It is also naturally curly &amp; I straighten it once or twice a week.</li>
            <li> It became soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> After two months of use, it still keeps my hair silky and soft.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair but get keratin every 4 months to reduce the curl and frizz.  </li>
            <li> I have used SILK 18 for my natural hair.  </li>
            <li> am 52 yrs old, female/newly postmenopausal</li>
            <li> I also noticed that the smell was still in my hair even after a couple of days which surprised me.</li>
            <li> WOW.</li>
            <li> but WOW.</li>
            <li> And, it&#x27;s all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> Me and my daughter both have naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by the results of trying this natural conditioner.  </li>
            <li> This conditioner leaves my hair so soft, manageable and</li>
            <li> how it&#x27;s all natural, sulfate-free, how it makes my hair easier to comb through.</li>
            <li> I have very curly and coarse hair and nothing seems to keep the &amp;#34;big&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> With this product I am liking my hair for the first time in a long time.  </li>
            <li> It is manageable, silky, soft and</li>
            <li> My hair become soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Two starts for natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> My 26 year old daughter researched and found this conditioner, raved about it for days, so I had to try it.  </li>
            <li> I was worried that it would make my hair too mushy and that it wouldn&#x27;t hold the curls I was attempting to form, but it formed bouncy and soft yet defined curls as if I used a gel.</li>
            <li> My hair is currently very silky because of my use of Silk18 conditioner, and I would definitely recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> My hair was so soft and manageable after using it</li>
            <li> so I was surprised by the results.  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel really soft.</li>
            <li> So far so goood.</li>
            <li> Everything listed in the ingredients was completely natural.</li>
            <li> It made my hair feel soft and helped with the dryness.</li>
            <li> I like the natural vanilla scent too.  </li>
            <li> I came upon it on a search for hair products that were natural.</li>
            <li> Another thing I like about it is that it&#x27;s 100% natural.  </li>
            <li> My doctor recommended me using all natural hair products and some treatments.</li>
            <li> Maybe for me a bit too soft, but I like the product as a protection for my hair.</li>
            <li> and I believe it&#x27;s because this product works with my natural oils rather than against it.</li>
            <li> I found that I cannot put too much on and only on the ends of my hair or it gives me a bit of a greasy feeling.  </li>
            <li> The only way I could really wear my hair</li>
            <li> naturally curly was</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, just to sum things up so far, I have been struggling with trying to get defined, soft, natural-looking curls for years.</li>
            <li> WOW</li>
            <li> WOW</li>
            <li> I would absolutely purchase this in the future.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and have tried everything out there...</li>
            <li> I ordered Silk18 Natural Conditioner based on favorable reviews, and the fact that it has naturally based ingredients.  </li>
            <li> This conditioner is helping my natural hair shows its waves without the frizz</li>

            <li> It leaves my hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t make my hair as soft as I was hoping for</li>
            <li> It has a natural vanilla smell, not a chemical smell.  </li>
            <li> The bonus is it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li> Recommend to anyone looking for a natural conditioner without chemical junk.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> So soft, I keep running my hands through</li>

            <li> It leaves my hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li> After some pro-active research, I decided to buy the Silk 18 natural conditioner along with Pura d&#x27;or Hair Loss Prevention shampoo.</li>
            <li> Natural and sulfate-free.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> So far it is halfway gone</li>
            <li> It makes my hair soft and shiny for days.</li>
            <li> This makes it feel soft and silky again.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my hair soft and manageable.</li>

            <li> and hair feels as soft as it has ever been.</li>
            <li> Hair is radiant, soft, and in control for days.</li>

            <li> It leaves my hair feeling soft and silky.  </li>
            <li> Hair feels soft and silky after use and it is natural.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hydrating and lightweight enough for straight hair without being too oily.</li>
            <li> - You need to use a lot of product in order to completely cover your hair.</li>
            <li> Vanilla is not my favorite scent, so while this is a negative imo, it might be a plus to others.</li>
            <li> but this far out weighs that.  </li>
            <li> this conditioner keeps my hair so soft..</li>

            <li> like my natural hair too...</li>
            <li> Leaves hair silky, soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a lot of luck with natural products.</li>
            <li> The Silk 18 conditioner makes my hair so soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> Since I have an itchy, oily scalp, I will always refrain from using conditioners directly on it.</li>
            <li> A conditioner that offers everything that you want and nothing that you don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy and leaves my hair feeling really soft.  </li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m liking this product and hope to reach the 5 star mark with continued use.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a conditioner with natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> My hair has never been so soft and it is also not frizzy.</li>
            <li> and it is soft curls.</li>
            <li> so she can make the switch to natural products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair sooo soft.</li>
            <li> It feels 10x stronger and it is so soft and shiny now.</li>
            <li> Not heavy, and leaved hair feeling really soft</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft.</li>
            <li> This makes my hair really soft.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my hair soft, but not greasy and does not damage color treatment.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;m outside so much</li>
            <li> but I can say that I can rum my fingers through my hair without them getting caught and it feels silky and soft.</li>
            <li> and it makes my hair soft.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair soft.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Now, to the product… The reason that I bought this conditioner was because I had just gotten my hair professionally colored</li>
            <li> but it feels completely transformed after one use.  </li>
            <li> My face/body does not look like I am as old as I am ..</li>
            <li> Because it is a natural product I do understand the justification</li>
            <li> it makes my hair soft and shine</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a woman of color with naturally kinky hair, and this conditioner helped with my damaged hair and split ends.</li>
            <li> Truly cannot be beaten, and I have run the gamut on natural conditioners.</li>
            <li> It was just too soft.  </li>
            <li> It was soft.</li>
            <li> It is a soft vanilla smell.</li>
            <li> Also, my hair is oily but since i have been using Maple Holistics Degreaser shampoo along with Silk18 my hair&#x27;s oil has balanced out to where my hair is now soft and not greasy and oily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very interested in trying out their other products.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by this conditioner.</li>
            <li> if you are sensitive at all I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I decided to switch to an all natural conditioner thinking it would help.</li>
            <li> This stuff has also made my hair so soft.</li>
            <li> I switched to what I thought was a natural shampoo and conditioner brand, but it was not.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly/wavy hair</li>
            <li> and it made my hair extremely soft.</li>
            <li> This product is not 100% natural.</li>
            <li> I do not like a product with unnatural fragrance in it as I am sensitive to it and do not want my baby to be around it at all.</li>
            <li> The only issue I have that almost made me give it 4 instead of 5 stars is that the bottle doesn&#x27;t give you a whole lot for the price.</li>
            <li> but after using this product my hair is so soft and silky (beyond my imagination).</li>
            <li> - i&#x27;m sensitive to smells and have skin allergies.</li>
            <li> Makes hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been pleasantly surprised by this conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Now that I am nearly done with the bottle, my hair is not as soft as it used to be.</li>
            <li> so I follow with this moisturizing conditioner and my hair is soft and there&#x27;s no dryness.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t feel like it was absorbing into my hair, I left it in for about five minutes while in the shower.</li>
            <li> The Silk 18 Natural Conditioner was the number one seller on Amazon, but I still read the reviews and did some research.  </li>
            <li> So I was on the search for a Natural conditioner and Silk</li>
            <li> But I would want to give a try to the natural shampoo.</li>
            <li> so far this works, even my kids are using it.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a natural, color-friendly conditioner to revive my overprocessed, straw-like hair.  </li>
            <li> After one use, my hair is soft, silky, and shiny.  </li>
            <li> It makes it soft like silk.</li>
            <li> Not heavy.  </li>
            <li> and I have found that I only need about a dime size amount for my meduim length straight hair.</li>
            <li> Leaves them silky, soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> This conditioner smooths my wild hair considerably.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m naturally curly</li>
            <li> I needed a product that would not irritate my sensitive scalp, but still leave my hair soft.  </li>
            <li> If you are sensitive to smells, avoid this conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I have very frizzy hair especially in the summer time</li>
            <li> It is, as one reviewer put it &#x27;almost too soft&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> Makes my hair so soft and silky.</li>
            <li> a old friend of mine told me about this product</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair shiny and soft.  </li>
            <li> I feel my hair is alive after using this product.</li>
            <li> and I used to have to put after that leave-in conditioner to make it feel soft.</li>
            <li> The conditioner relaxed the  frizz of  my hair, creating soft defined curls.  </li>
            <li> This conditioner works well and keeps my hair soft and moist.</li>
            <li> I must admit I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> My hair feels soft and oil-free for days.  </li>
            <li> I am 47 years old with shoulder length natural &amp;#34;silver&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> quite the opposite really.</li>
            <li> Now I have gained an extra day between showers because this conditioner has helped so much.</li>
            <li> Just soft tangle-free hair that smells</li>
            <li> Silky baby soft hair.</li>
            <li> But I found that this actually didn&#x27;t make me itch as much as I thought it would.</li>
            <li> but I like that it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li> I also like the fact that this product is all natural, without parabens.</li>
            <li> With the water shortage out here, no one wants to be waiting 10 minutes between shampoo and final rinse.</li>
            <li> I use natural soap on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Conditioner left my hair very manageable.</li>

            <li> I was pleasantly surprised at the results after using this conditioner.</li>
            <li> My hair is so soft and shiny</li>
            <li> But the outer touch was soft.</li>
            <li> I was using another natural conditioner</li>

            <li> So far I&#x27;ve bought over 10 bottles.</li>
            <li> you have sensitive skin (</li>
            <li> My hair became soft &amp; shiny after using this conditioner.</li>
            <li> Got Silk conditioner and Argan oil Shampoo a week ago, and so far I&#x27;ve used both in combination 3 times.</li>
            <li> The drug store conditioner made my hair feel soft, but look frizzy and undefined.  </li>
            <li> I am switching over to an all natural hair/face product line.</li>
            <li> Price seemed reasonable, especially with the sale that is going on.</li>
            <li> My hair was still soft, even after 10 minutes of t-shirt drying.  </li>
            <li> I feel like the natural women on those youtube videos that rave about a conditioner they just tried while they&#x27;re rubbing there hair in the mirror.</li>
            <li> I like that this is natural and my hair likes that it contains no sulfates.</li>
            <li> should I try next?&amp;#34; I considered switching brands completely, but knowing that Silk 18 is made with natural ingredients</li>
            <li> It also has helped with frizziness and had made my hair overall much smoother.</li>
            <li> Wow, what a difference.  </li>

            <li> so far have made my hair noticeably softer and smoother.  </li>
            <li> Hair that I hadn&#x27;t felt since nearly fifteen years.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft and silky just like it said it would.</li>
            <li> within days I noticed a difference in my curly hair;  it feels soft</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start off saying I was surprised at the size of the bottle</li>
            <li> conditioner made my hair sooo soft</li>
            <li> It makes it soft which in turn makes it manageable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> if you switch between this conditioners every so often, with this, then your hair will continue to be soft.</li>
            <li> /&gt;THE SMELL: natural vanilla.</li>
            <li> It reminds me of that vegan store called Lush (naturally hand made products for skin, hair, etc.)</li>
            <li> Not to heavy and has a light vanilla scent.</li>
            <li> oh-so-soft, and completely detangled my hair.</li>
            <li> During the time that I waiting for it to arrive and not using any conditioner, the shedding stopped -- completely.</li>
            <li> Either there is something in this conditioner that shouldn&#x27;t be in it, or I am personally sensitive to one of the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> Leaves your hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m all natural and have been for 2 1/2 years.</li>
            <li> Maybe because I&#x27;ve been using natural shampoo for months now.</li>
            <li> Not a heavy conditioner</li>
            <li> It leaves their hair extremely soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I occasionally use a tiny bit as a leave-in as well, but is rarely needed.</li>
            <li> This conditioner leaves my hair smooth and soft without leaving a heavy residue.</li>
            <li> so I have to use a lot of product and this is more expensive, but it is totally worth it to me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m definitely going to order a few more bottles.</li>
            <li> I only shampoo a few times a week - at most - and use the product each time.  </li>
            <li> I have only used it a few times and every time my hair looks better.  </li>
            <li> Oops, a few more gross details about my hair and habits.</li>
            <li> It is thick conditioner, and don&#x27;t need to use  too much to get smooth healthier looking hair.</li>
            <li> But overall i felt its a good product but felt it to be bit expensive as it really hasnt worked wonders.</li>
            <li> It is thick and luxurious and I love that it is a holistic product.</li>
            <li> the type of person that loves my hair products to smell good, this product unfortunately doesn&#x27;t have a smell.</li>
            <li> but kind of thin and watery.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it&#x27;s still a good product, just not what I was expecting.  </li>
            <li> I use essential oils for cleaning, instead of over-the-counter medications and in my massage business,-it&#x27;s nice to find a product that&#x27;s up to my high standard for natural purity and as a bonus was worked like a charm to tame my curly mane!</li>
            <li> These last months I keep traveling between two different climates: one is very hot and very humid, the other one is extremely dry, cool and windy.</li>
            <li> I have very frizzy long hair and live in a very humid Australian climate.</li>
            <li> This conditioner does not feel heavy and oily--it is light and fluffy and works perfectly for my hair, which is very thin.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair silky smooth, and i notice LESS frizzies when i use it!</li>
            <li> I have thick wavy hair that can get pretty dry, and this product has helped my hair retain more moisture, as well as prevent frizz.</li>
            <li> It is very frustrating since most of my hair is straight, but the tangled regions look very fractured and damaged, even after combing it out.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many different conditioners to tame my frizzy hair</li>
            <li> LoveThis prosuct tried it once and it made my hair so soft and healthy feeling without have the itchy thick conditioner scalp my hair felt clean for quite a few days and stayed soft.</li>
            <li> but if you have long hair or if you need to wash your hair often, you will definitely go through this bottle rather quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not entirely sure why a company would make a natural conditioner and then scent it so strongly.</li>
            <li> When I was using devacurl it was way more expensive, and it left my hair smelling super strongly of herbs, which I disliked.</li>
            <li> but it actually feels normal now!</li>
            <li> Managing my long, thick hair can be overwhelming at times especially when I would like for it to be soft and pretty!</li>
            <li> plus I noticed is that even though we&#x27;re having really humid weather right now where I live, my hair didn&#x27;t pouf up like it usually does.  </li>
            <li> (i.e. a small amount easily covers my head</li>
            <li> my hair is pretty dry because I always bleach my hair for coloring and highlights .</li>
            <li> I also wanted a conditioner that was sulfate free to allow my curls to actually form since 2c and 2b hair tends to be thinner than other curly hair types.</li>
            <li> I bought this conditioner completely unaware of the other products available.</li>
            <li> so well I don&#x27;t use as much as with other shampoos, very efficient.  </li>
            <li> After I bleached my hair couple times, my hair start hating me and became pretty dry.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get past the horribly strong &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34; of vanilla.</li>
            <li> It costs a little more than what I usually spend on hair products, but I think it is absolutely worth it.</li>
            <li> I have coarse greying hair, and in recent months with more grey areas coming in, my hair has become totally unmagageable with cowlicks sticking up everywhere when I get up in the morning.  </li>
            <li> In fact, it&#x27;s probably not as soft as it is when I use conventional conditioner, but it&#x27;s worth it because of the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> That being said, it is not priced like many similar natural products that are equal in results, it is very reasonably priced as a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> As a result, I will need less argon oil to keep my dry ends healthy and go longer between trims.</li>
            <li> I can actually air dry it without having super poofy, frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair is SUPER dry and this actually works.</li>
            <li> I also love the natural, subtle vanilla scent this conditioner leaves.</li>
            <li> I got lucky with thicker full head of coarse, dry and frizzy mess with out product.</li>
            <li> I have had snarly, fine hair for my entire life and can vividly recall crying and protesting, throughout my early childhood, while my mother tried to brush through my hair.  </li>
            <li> left my hair so straight and easy to straighten; I have never straightened my hair with a flat iron in less than 10</li>
            <li> Left my hair feeling amazing after only a few uses!</li>
            <li> This smells like vanilla (ok), makes some of my hair feel soft (ok), but it makes my hair tangle like CRAZY!  </li>
            <li> What I really love is that a little goes a long way and I can apply it from roots to ends</li>
            <li> Because I did not add anything else to my hair before flat ironing, it feels so much softer.    </li>
            <li> Because of this I think that some of the broken hairs that I have at the  front were actually a bit more flyaway at first, but not in the frizzy way they used to be.  </li>
            <li> I only wash my hair twice a week and it stays soft even on the days I only rinse with hot water.</li>
            <li> It is kind of a small bottle for the price, which may be the only draw back.</li>
            <li> Most all natural shampoos and conditioners are pretty expensive, so when I saw this one on &amp;#34;sale&amp;#34; for $10.77, I figured I&#x27;d give it a try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to try their other products in the near future.  </li>
            <li> You also barely need to use any for your hair to be soft!</li>
            <li> I have long, curly, frizzy hair that is tough to get a brush through without a good conditioner</li>
            <li> My ends in the shower even feel dry, and I generally finger detangle my hair and spend too much time carefully picking apart fairy knots and using hand full after handfull of conditioner to get through my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After my hair was destroyed by a botched professional bleach job, I searched high and low for a product to save the remnants of hair.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need very much of the product, a nickel size is usually enough to coat my hair, so this product will hopefully last me months.</li>
            <li> some not - and the baking soda/apple cider vinegar method, most of which either made my hair too dry, or had the opposite effect and left my hair greasy and matted-looking by the next day.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t really subtle despite what some people say, so make sure you like vanilla before buying this.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> with our well water, it rinses out cleanly and leaves my long, fine, thin hair feeling and looking great.&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li> I have fine, straight, shoulder-length hair, which is naturally dark blonde, but I have been coloring for a number of years to cover the grey.  </li>
            <li> This is ok, but I have used better products that were less expensive.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many products over my 55 years that it is ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> , it has a nicer, more subtle scent.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product for anyone with dry hair or who simply wants a natural product that creates a soft texture.  </li>
            <li> I felt since I have done hours of research on different conditioners (including this particular one)</li>
            <li> so I only use about a dimes worth but it just seems to go a long way.</li>
            <li> I use a decent, but not too big amount, start on my ends and work my way up, then comb it through and leave on for a couple minutes.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it was on a &#x27;wash only&#x27; day, as I shampoo only 2-3 times a week.  </li>
            <li> After several weeks of using, I came to the conclusion that this shampoo delivers exactly as desribed by the seller because I am seeing some obvious improvements in which regards the look of my hair.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s not homeopathic in any way) on the bottle, wtf is up with that?</li>
            <li> Regular conditioners do not make the cut, so I went on Amazon and searched for cruelty free under conditioners (under beauty) and sorted by average customer review.</li>
            <li> and I think its a better product than any of the higher end and expensive lines.</li>
            <li> Also I&#x27;m not a fan of fragrance, but this is shampoo has a very subtle vanilla smell which is nice.</li>
            <li> I originally ordered Silk18 Natural Conditioner (and the Maple Holistics Teatree Oil Shampoo) for my granddaughter who recently had head lice and had to have her very long, curly hair cut short after chemical lice treatments.  </li>
            <li> I have very fine but frizzy hair and this conditioner provides just the right amount of weight to my hair to prevent crazy frizz, while still staying soft but not oily looking.  </li>
            <li> It does not seem to moisturize as well as I expected, but my hair isn&#x27;t dry, so I suppose it&#x27;s more that this conditioner isn&#x27;t ridiculously rich &amp; thick like store brand conditioners.</li>
            <li> This conditioner instantly makes my stressed out hair relax and smooth down.  </li>
            <li> I have long, fine blonde hair, and have never loved a hair conditioner so much!!!</li>
            <li> The products are a little on the costly side for such a small amount, but hey, it&#x27;s worth every penny if I&#x27;m able to wear my hair naturally and get compliments!</li>
            <li> I emailed them, telling them what had happened, and they they promptly sent me a FULL SIZED product to try,  instead of the little sample bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard of the no-poo method, but I&#x27;m not willing to deviate enough to feel that my hair isn&#x27;t clean or conditioned.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this conditioner, but the only con I would mention is the smell.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for anyone and especially my fellow curly girls!</li>
            <li> Overall I highly recommend trying this.</li>
            <li> highly recommend and I will definitely be purchasing again!</li>
            <li> I definitely plan to keep on using this product and recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> And I highly recommend this to you if you have similar problem.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve searched high and low for a conditioner that doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy looking and feeling after washing with it.</li>
            <li> I have seen major differences in the last two months since using this product, my hair is soft, smooth, and much less brittle...</li>
            <li> I have been looking for new all natural hair care for some time and this product is a total answer to my prayers!</li>
            <li> I have major issues with my hair!  </li>
            <li> also like the fact that they are chemical free - compared to your typical big box store offerings</li>
            <li> This conditioner really does the job of leaving my dry hair well nourished and soft after a shampoo treatment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve really noticed a transformation from my once unruly, super thick and curly hair.</li>
            <li> I like to leave it in my hair overnight and feel like it moisturizes just as well, if not better, than the chemical filled alternatives.</li>
            <li> Used as just a regular conditioner it de tangled my hair and left it really shiny and soft</li>
            <li> and (for me) lasts almost as long because you don&#x27;t have to use as much.</li>
            <li> (I clog the shower drain every time I shower because I shed so frequently), coarse hair normally.</li>
            <li> I normally use salon brands only but figured I&#x27;d give this a try</li>
            <li> I am completely natural and I only use natural products!</li>
            <li> But I actually end up using about 1/4 the amount of conditioner that i normally would.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I tried my deep conditioner that I use normally, a salon brand deep conditioner, my normal conditioner, I even tried the eggs and mayo remedy.</li>
            <li> My first time using this conditioner my hair was pliable when wet</li>
            <li> love the results I got from using this, but this bottle would last me a very short amount of time, used it while traveling around America for a few weeks</li>
            <li> first couple tries I was using it, it did not help detangle my hair when I went to brush it.</li>
            <li> Finally I noticed a true difference that isn&#x27;t seeming to go away with each use as is the case with other shampoos and conditioners.</li>
            <li> As a male, the last thing I wanted was for my hair to smell like a baked good or, worse, a Yankee Candle all day.</li>
            <li> This is a really quality products that smells good, nourishes the hair very well, and isn&#x27;t full of any nasty and potentially harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t even let the conditioner sit for more than a minute before rinsing and it still conditions very well without leaving my hair weighed down and greasy.  </li>
            <li> Second, since I have very fine hair, I only need to use a small amount on the ends and it already smooths out my hair.  </li>
            <li> This left my hair very soft with less frizz, and more shine, absolutely no oil or weight traces.</li>
            <li> I love keeping a tiny little bit in my hair after rinsing for soft hair all day long.</li>
            <li> No more itchy scalp and my hair is so clean and soft.  </li>
            <li> Really liked it, as it left my curly, thick hair super soft plus no frizz in the south Carolina&#x27;s humid late spring this year.</li>
            <li> My hair is very dry and this product made it very shinny and soft without weighing it down.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now my hair is very fine and thin</li>
            <li> I have very fine, thin hair and</li>
            <li> This product helps in keeping my hair more normal and less dried out then before when I was not using &amp;#34;Silk 18&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I have bleached my hair, had perms done, and a lot of heat damage, but this stuff brings my super long asian hair back to life.</li>
            <li> I have a short afro due to me embracing my african american roots, I went full on natural and this product is number oe for me !!!</li>
            <li> Leaves your hair nice and soft especially if you have long thick hair.</li>
            <li> I let my hair air dry and what a huge difference from other conditioners.</li>
            <li> I usually have super sensitive skin and break out to almost everything I try and use!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also full of alcohol and not seemingly all that different from conventional conditioners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> noticed immediately after my first wash with the shampoo followed by this conditioner that my hair was unbelievable silky and smooth, unlike any other product ive used, and believe me ive tried many.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is my new daily shampoo.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my new standard conditioner.</li>
            <li> I live in southern California</li>
            <li> I live in the desert in Southern California and this products works!  </li>
            <li> I have long hair, medium thickness, with a pretty tight curl and after a week of using Silk18 my hair curls from roots to tips in consistent rings and</li>
            <li> However, I am not certain I like it better than Maple Holistics&#x27; other similar Argan conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry damaged hair and this conditioner really helped with that.</li>
            <li> I thought the conditioner really helped moisturize my dry scalp and relieve any itchiness.</li>
            <li> but because I bleached my hair, it became very damaged, dry, and unmanageable.</li>
            <li> Really helps moisturize my hair which is getting dry as it grays.  </li>
            <li> Over the summer my hair has become really brittle and dry from the sun and chlorine.  </li>
            <li> My hair is dry and very freezy..</li>
            <li> and it really helps my waist length dry hair.</li>
            <li> I have very curly dry fizzy hair and this conditioner works wonders.  </li>
            <li> I really like the product and would recommend it if you have dry hair and want it to feel softer.</li>
            <li> omggg this made my hair super soft and i have the type of hair that gets so rough n dry after washing</li>
            <li> My ends are frazzled and dry, but I really didn&#x27;t want to cut my hair.</li>
            <li> she couldn&#x27;t believe how much it had grown in such a short amount of time!</li>
            <li> Though this might sound unappealing, I was actually extremely excited to feel the strange texture because this meant that it really was unlike any other product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Very waxy and really leaves a heavy coat if you don&#x27;t use a clarifying shampoo in between uses.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a black woman with long, fine, wavy hair.</li>
            <li> Also i was unsure about buying this because some natural products (such as natural bug spray) don&#x27;t work as well as they claim.</li>
            <li> I have dry, frizzy hair and was left with soft, healthy, bouncy curls after leaving it on in the shower for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Even the parts that are dead were soft and looked really fresh.</li>
            <li> It feels much stronger, looks fuller, and actually stays feeling conditioned after washing for several days</li>
            <li> After trying numerous conditioners, I have finally found this product that really works.</li>
            <li> I have natural hair and makes my hair feel so soft after is use the same brand for dandruff shampoo.</li>
            <li> For the last 3 years it has been really struggling, breaking, falling out, and has been extra tangley and unmanagable.</li>
            <li> Left my natural, coily hair soft and detangling was a breeze.</li>
            <li> The conditioner leaving my thick hair soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Our hair is soft and not dry or &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; feeling.  </li>
            <li> Treat your hair well, it really can add or take away from your overall appearance and overall self esteem.</li>
            <li> I have straight hair in the front and coarse curly hair in the back.</li>
            <li> The difference doesn&#x27;t really make sense as both projects list all the same ingredients and in the same order, with the one additional ingredient of &amp;#34;natural vanilla fragrance&amp;#34; added to the Silk 18.</li>
            <li> and wow it felt thick and smooth, even the ends.  </li>
            <li> I have only used silk 18 for few times and it gives my hair a smooth finish.</li>
            <li> On top of all that, I have continuously bleached my hair for more years in a row than I can count (hair dressers hate me for it,</li>
            <li> Okay, so I ran out of conditioner and was using some really drying (and ironically expensive keratin shampoo) for a week before I received this conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I love using this, and I think I will slowly transition into only using Maple Holistics brand for my hair.</li>
            <li> Work well, conditions without being super heavy.  </li>
            <li> It turned my 35 year old dry brittle hair back to my soft silkie 20 yrs old hair!!!</li>
            <li> My hair is very long and fine and this did not weigh it down.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You can store it upside down or right side up.</li>
            <li> Still trying to pin down the right shampoo from there line that works for my dandruff</li>
            <li> second beef is that the conditioner doesn&#x27;t go very far.</li>
            <li> It has left my hair very soft and silky after using it.</li>
            <li> It left my hair feeling very soft and silky.</li>
            <li> I have a friend who is very sensitive to perfumes and she has no problems sitting next to me</li>
            <li> The only drawback for me - I am very sensitive to smells</li>
            <li> I have been using Silk 18 as a leave-in conditioner every other day for the past week, and it has already made the middle of my hair much softer and more mousturized.</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it 4 stars is due to the strong smell of vanilla that lasts long after the shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Love the vanilla scent &amp; leaves my hair so soft, will not go back to buying any other shampoo&#x27;s or conditioners other than Maple Holistics!</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be switching back to my old conditioner again!</li>
            <li> No other conditioner has tangles my hair the way this product does.</li>
            <li> There is no other conditioner on the market that can match this product.</li>
            <li> The consistency is similar to Tresemme&#x27;s Natural Avocado Conditioner and the smell is heavenly!</li>
            <li> No other complaints.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now on my second bottle, my hair is silky and soft!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s free from harsh chemicals AND leaves my long hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li> I used it with Totlogic 2 in 1 shampoo and body wash and in my entire life, my hair has never been this soft!</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m outside and busy!)</li>
            <li> Silk 18 left my hair soft, manageable and my curls were shining like the stars!.  </li>
            <li> Wow! Where to start on how this conditioner has totally saved my hair!</li>
            <li> I felt a major improvement after one use.</li>
            <li> I have only used this three times, but I already see a difference in how soft my hair is!  </li>
            <li> I have coarse, wavy, color treated hair, and my hair has never felt so soft or looked so shiny!  </li>
            <li> Had no other expectations besides those.</li>
            <li> Using this conditioner my wet brush slides right through not only when my hair is coated in conditioner</li>
            <li> I have dry damaged hair, it makes my hair soft and normal again thank you.</li>
            <li> No more static or dry hair</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I paired this conditioner after the Argan Oil shampoo (which also worked beautifully by the way), and thoroughly brushed it through my long longs and waited at least a few minutes before showering.</li>
            <li> I just take a small spray bottle and put half of the silk 18 and the other half water, shake it up real good.....</li>
            <li> The argan and jojoba oils along with other natural ingredients have really improved the dryness of my processed hair.  </li>
            <li> I have very wavy/curly hair &amp; have a big problem with frizz as I let my hair dry naturally</li>
            <li> it was too heavy didn&#x27;t saturate and actually made it more dry.</li>
            <li> This, for instance, is mostly coconut oil and water, with shea butter and a few other oils.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Maple Holistic&#x27;s products are not exactly cheap, but I definitely think the products are worth the money!</li>
            <li> With lots of fine hair, I do have to take it into consideration that, perhaps a person with thick hair may like it.</li>
            <li> This conditioner just seemed to work for my thick but fine hair.</li>
            <li> I have very curly ethnic hair that tends to get very dry.</li>
            <li> Perhaps my hair is dryer than the average Jill, but I feel like the bottle is going way too fast, especially since it&#x27;s not super cheap.</li>
            <li> I have to pretty carefully ration-out my conditioner-use when I&#x27;m in the shower, but on the plus side, this stuff is so creamy and nourishing, that I don&#x27;t have to use as much on my roots as I used to, when I was using other conditioners.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But the real thing I love is how crazy soft my hair is!</li>
            <li> Last January when I first stumbled across this product, I was very skeptical due to all the great reviews but decided to go ahead and give this conditioner a try.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, it takes out the tangles, and my hair is smooth as it gets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Truly, a little goes a long way with this, so I feel the price is justified.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to squeeze out, but the product itself is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say there is anything special about the way my hair feels - it&#x27;s not silkier than usual.</li>
            <li> Silk 18 made my hair shiny, and it helped the curls clump better than the other brand I was using, but it also made my hair kinda stiff and crunchy.  </li>
            <li> I only use organic shampoo and organic products and this fits right in with all of my other products.</li>
            <li> If you diy you know that beauty/skin care ingredients - depending on what they are - are actually quite cheap and that only a little is used in a product.  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair easier to brush, smells good, and only takes a little bit in my extremely thick hair.  </li>
            <li> Having thin hair, I often struggle with finding a conditioner that does not weigh my hair down, and this one washes out clean and my hair feels light afterward.</li>
            <li> a side note, it is kind of hard to squeeze out of the bottle unless you have it stored upside down</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t a bad conditioner, but it isn&#x27;t great.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it hasn&#x27;t done anything amazing for my hair.  </li>
            <li> I had hoped the Silk 18 conditioner would calm her unruly dried out hair.  </li>
            <li> This conditioner gave my fine flyaway hair lots of body and shine, however after a few uses it made my hair seem dry with lots of frizzy</li>
            <li> I hope to continue seeing progress in my current state of hair health as I am transitioning from relaxed hair to my natural hair.</li>
            <li> I will continue to shop here in the near future.</li>
            <li> Not only did it make my hair feel soft and silky, but I was not shedding hair when I was applying it on my hair and after rinsing it off.  </li>
            <li> And each time, my hair was left soft and silky without my worrying about excess hair falling out.   </li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I have 3B/3C natural mixed race hair and my number one biggest problem is dryness.</li>
            <li> so I tried it and it left my hair so saturated and soft</li>
            <li> Not only did it untangle my hair but my hair was so soft for days.</li>
            <li> Left my hair feeling really soft.</li>
            <li> It made my hair extremely soft and supple as I styled for the following day.</li>
            <li> No regrets to invest on this product.</li>
            <li> I thought it would make my hair soft and silky and help detangle after washing, but it did just the opposite.  </li>
            <li> The results/difference are apparent immediately after use.</li>
            <li> I have gone through the gamut of natural, paraben-free, sulfate-free shampoos and conditioners, until finally stumbling upon the Maple Holistics brand.</li>
            <li> I used it only 3 times so far</li>
            <li> I like trying different conditioners for my natural hair.</li>
            <li> I tried several natural hair products but they made my hair unmanageable,tangle;therefore</li>
            <li> I wanted to find a product that was all natural but actually worked, which until now, i didnt think was possible.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> u should tried u won&#x27;t regret it and finally found it a natural product that I can use for as conditioner and leaving and</li>
            <li> I can barely get a comb through it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product once so far but reviewed it thoroughly before purchasing</li>
            <li> My hair actually felt soft.</li>
            <li> I am natural and recently straightened my hair and acquired quite a bit of heat damage</li>
            <li> This product left my hair silky soft, and got my waves under control.</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t cut it nearly often enough.</li>
            <li> I tried consecutive use for 2 weeks and had to switch back to my old conditioner because brushing my hair became a tangled nightmare.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t want to use my natural look as much as possible...</li>
            <li> So those who are saying that apparently need to brush up on their reading comprehension skills.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> My hair and I have been searching for and trying out &#x27;natural&#x27; shampoos and conditioners for several years.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I only wash my hair once or twice a week so not to over strip the natural oils.</li>
            <li> It left my hair so silky and soft.</li>
            <li> I have only used this conditioner once so far.</li>
            <li> together they left my hair soft and shiney.</li>
            <li> We use it daily and leaves hair feeling incredibly soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> My hair has become dry as I have gotten older and also use color.  </li>
            <li> After one use all my hair is the same soft shiny texture.</li>
            <li> I get compliments on how shiny &amp; soft my hair is &amp; washing/combing is not such a chore after using it.</li>
            <li> By day 2, the frizz from my hair is completely gone and the shine is back!</li>
            <li> When I discovered SILK I immediately cancelled all future shipments of my old brand.  </li>
            <li> I was searching for a natural shampoo and conditioner after trying multiple products, including leave in conditioners and oils.  </li>
            <li> Leaves hair feeling silky and soft, even the next day&lt;</li>
            <li> I am the happiest I&#x27;ve ever been with my hair outside of a professional treatment.</li>
            <li> Yes, it left my hair soft and manageable after using the Maple Holistics Argan Oil Shampoo, Sulfate Free.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> Which definitely were NOT dried or damaged.</li>
            <li> Secondly, (I&#x27;ve only used it twice so far)</li>
            <li> Completely revived my hair in a way that left me speechless..</li>
            <li> You just have to be careful with how much of this you use.  </li>
            <li> So far my only quarrel with the product is pricing</li>
            <li> /&gt;Maple Holistics Natural Conditioner gets my approval especially if you&#x27;re not concerned with the cost (whatever it</li>
            <li> I have natural ash blonde hair</li>
            <li> Perhaps it is because I used the Tea Tree shampoo for my scalp prior to using this conditioner, but my hair did not feel soft and &amp;#34;nourished&amp;#34; after I used it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going back to my old standby:</li>
            <li> This helped me bring my hair back its old luster.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for about 2 weeks, but so far it&#x27;s a keeper.</li>
            <li> Male, early 30-s.</li>
            <li> Then, after very scrutinized and careful research and reading of hundreds of consumer reviews, I came across Maple Holistics.</li>
            <li> my son, 26 years old recently mentioned he had an uncontrollable dandruff problem, and nothing he tried worked.  </li>
            <li> This conditioner left my hair silky soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my coarse hair feeling so soft.</li>
            <li> I have switched over to using only natural products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m older, and my hair is so dry</li>
            <li> The effect is similar to applying silicones in your hair, but this is natural.</li>
            <li> Silk 18 has actually managed to give my hair the BUSINESS by making my hair retain a soft moisturized feel for now 6 days.  </li>
            <li> My husband has thick caucasian hair that tangles, and this conditioner has helped keep his hair smooth and manageable.</li>
            <li> And it has a subtle vanilla sent which I prefer over the strong smelling hair products.</li>
            <li> (I usually always use a shampoo conditioner combo for full effect).</li>
            <li> Seems like a random drawing kind of thing to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am not impressed with this conditioner, but to be honest my hair needs a lot of work.</li>
            <li> not too expensive, good for daily use... definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I read reviews about this product and decided to give it a try, though honestly I was a bit skeptical that it would work as well as people claimed.</li>
            <li> it is worth trying it for a few weeks to see if it works for your hair.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical for a number of reasons, but mainly because so many people with positive reviews had coarse, curly hair.  </li>
            <li> I was really let down by this conditioner , I clearly was not looking for a miracle in a bottle just a product that would&lt;br</li>
            <li> The conditioner is nice and thick meaning the product is not watered down.  </li>
            <li> It even dries frizz free with very little to no styling product!</li>
            <li> I have very fine, thin hair, relatively short.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to use it a little more sparingly, but it has still only lasted me about 3 weeks for every other day use for medium length hair.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for dry and damaged hair.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this conditioner for dry hair or any hair for that matter.</li>
            <li> I live by the ocean and swim in saltwater daily for the entire year!</li>
            <li> After the very first use it left my naturally wavy thick hair soft and supple.</li>
            <li> I have really coarse, dry, chemically straightened hair, and this conditioner works really well.</li>
            <li> so I started looking for an affordable natural product that made my dry hair soft and did not have cones.</li>
            <li> i have dry color treated hair and so far silk18 is making my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> The smell as everyone claims is a dreamy vanilla and just letting it soak in for 2 minutes before rinsing it off made my hair super soft and the frizz is reduced by at least 80%.</li>
            <li> Those chemicals you are absorbing while taking a shower dry out your hair and skin big time.</li>
            <li> When my hair is feeling extra dry, I just put a squirt of this on the ends and they feel much softer.  </li>
            <li> This stuff, I use much less than I normally would, then follow up with my normal bit of moroccan oil...</li>
            <li> Although the bottle seems smaller than a typical store-bought conditioner, it&#x27;s well worth it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so difficult finding a GOOD conditioner that works on my dry, brittle, frizzy, unruly curly hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell of cheap perfumes, Wen Haircare products, and other conventional hair products.  </li>
            <li> I only have this conditioner by MH, but it works great with other random shampoos that I have lying around the house.</li>
            <li> I have very little hair, and on top of that it is extremely thin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Sadly, though, with my fine short hair I got more of a limp result.  </li>
            <li> Also a little goes a long way which is nice because when I initally got the bottle I was surprised by how small it was.</li>
            <li> First, I have very fine curly hair that will frizz if I don&#x27;t use a conditioner and would be impossible to comb out after a shampoo.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I used as much as a typical high-end conditioner would require.  </li>
            <li> With the two,my hair falls a lot less and within the first week I noticed the immediate change in the texture and look of my hair.</li>
            <li> I am not one that uses conditioner that often because it tends to make my hair look greasy and dirty but after using the Natural Conditioner I fell in love!</li>
            <li> No big difference, and much higher in price then other products</li>
            <li> I got this (and several other stuff from &amp;#34;the amazon&amp;#34;) yesterday.</li>
            <li> I got this (and several other stuff from &amp;#34;the amazon&amp;#34;) yesterday.</li>
            <li> Over the past two years, I have transitioned my diet and products I use from traditional to organic and Eco friendly.</li>
            <li> This is the first natural conditioner that didn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling dry and stringy or extremely greasy.  </li>
            <li> I did a simple blow out after washing and using the product and I have used no other products on my hair as I wanted to see what the raves are all about!  </li>
            <li> My hair is very dry and frizzy and used to be thick and course, but has been thinning significantly as I&#x27;ve gotten older.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend to people with dry hair!</li>
            <li> I normally have very dry coarse african american hair and my hair did become soft and stayed soft even after I washed out the conditioner.</li>
            <li> I accidentally used to much and it didn&#x27;t affect my hair as other products would.</li>
            <li> I have medium, straight-wavy hair that has been falling out a bit due to illness, and this conditioner makes it feel much better.&lt;br /&gt;Update:  </li>
            <li> I will absolutely be trying other maple holistic products out because of this conditioner.</li>
            <li> she had very tangled hair and is extremely tender headed.</li>
            <li> It is 3b curly type hair (cuacasion hair that is very curly in some areas and wavy in other areas and tends to be frizzy).  </li>
            <li> I use a very small amount and it conditions my hair thoroughly with a light vanilla scent that lasts.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see much of a difference when compared to other conditioners though.</li>
            <li> do not have any real smell as compared to other brands.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve really messed up my hair with other products including the baking soda</li>
            <li> In my opinion, both the shampoo and the Silk 18 conditioner seam to complement each other really well.</li>
            <li> (I don&#x27;t see how some of the other people reviewing it could go through the whole bottle in just 1 week).</li>
            <li> It took us a long time to find a natural product that worked!</li>
            <li> I agree with other reviewers--a little does go a long way; however, I still feel like $13 should buy more than 2 months worth of conditioner (and I condition my hair every other day and also have long hair).</li>
            <li> I have really long hair, and it just takes a little bit to do the full length.  </li>
            <li> My hair looks more alive and less dull.</li>
            <li> My hair looks more alive and less dull.</li>
            <li> and I live in Phoenix so it is getting dry on the bottom portion.  </li>
            <li> My hair is seriously silky smooth</li>
            <li> I was always afraid of conditioner because my hair can get really greasy and oily real quick, but I read that curly hair needs moisture, so I gave conditioners a try, as well as trying to go &amp;#34;no-poo&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;lo-poo&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I love the smell, I was afraid that it would be too much</li>
            <li> My hair seemed to go through a dry spell, but I was using a different shampoo (common store brand), so I switched to Maple Holistic&#x27;s hydrate shampoo to see if it compliments the silk18 better.  </li>
            <li> It will definitely help to condition your scalp and, if you are a sometimes-dandruff sufferer, like I am, the combination of this conditioner with the occasional use of any tea-tree oil shampoo, should really help to get rid of any dry scalp problems.</li>
            <li> For specific ethnic groups, daily hair cleansing strips the natural oils required to prevent brittle hair.</li>
            <li> I was at the point where I felt completely discouraged, since everything I tried prior to Silk 18 had lots to desire in the final results.</li>
            <li> I also love the smell of it, it doesn&#x27;t smell fake, it smells like vanilla and natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I still needed to use some all day conditioner and oils to keep it hydrated, but this is the only natural conditioner I have used that actually  has worked for my hair.  </li>
            <li> Not only silky and soft, but I smelled of vanilla the entire day!</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY natural conditioner I have found that actually works.</li>
            <li> I can not say it enough, These shampoos and conditioners try to put back the natural oils that these chemicals in the water are taking out.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tested several conditioners throughout the years, but this is the only one that makes my hair this soft and frizz-free.</li>
            <li> Also it seemed like near my scalp was constantly oily, but I usually only apply the conditioner to my ends.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not dry and frizzy</li>
            <li> does not dry my hair out after blow drying.  </li>
            <li> Works okay for my relaxed hair but left a medicine like smell behind.</li>
            <li> Smells nice, but honestly my thin curly hair did not really benefit from this conditioner.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is super thick, really stays on my wet hair without dripping off while I shave my legs.  </li>
            <li> I have many daughters with long hair and have had such a hard time finding an organic conditioner that actually works.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product if your hair is in rough shape...</li>
            <li> Just to further help others in need of moisturized, beautiful hair:  when my cousin came for a visit she asked about what I was using on my hair... needless to say, she jumped at the opportunity to take an extra bottle of the product I had in my closet when I offer it to her in case she wanted to try the conditioner for a few days herself.</li>
            <li> I have extremely  dry hair and this condition completely turned my hair around after one use!</li>
            <li> I have long, fine, thin, fragile, dry, natural, pin straight, caucasian hair.</li>
            <li> Silk 18 is more expensive (especially considering how much conditioner I use), but I&#x27;m a sucker for natural products and the reviews made it seem promising.  </li>
            <li> I can not speak as to the health aspects, but as a conditioner it does not work any better than any other natural health food store conditioner at less than half the price.</li>
            <li> Giving it 4 stars(more of 4 and 1/2) as I think bottles are bit too slick and so holds less quantity, should be more for the price.</li>
            <li> Luckily, you only need to use a small amount.</li>
            <li> I have spent many of wasted money on salon products only to find out that they make my hair greasy or dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried every high end product under the sun and found that most of them weigh my thin, curly hair down.</li>
            <li> And the interesting thing is that my hair takes less time to become dry and less frizz</li>
            <li> I was looking for a conditioner that would make my hair silky and soft for a long time.</li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy long hair</li>
            <li> Additionally, the Natural Conditioner doesn&#x27;t leave any gross residue on your skin like other conditioners and, hello, it&#x27;s all natural!</li>
            <li> My hair has not been this soft for a long time.</li>
            <li> for long time my hair hasn&#x27;t been that soft after I used this product .</li>
            <li> I am 64, and it makes my long hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I use it on my 13 inch long beard, split ends are gone and it is manageable and soft.</li>
            <li> Leaves my corse grey colored hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t been this soft or shiney in so long.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s under the hot sun a lot and exposed to salty harsh ocean water as well as chlorine.</li>
            <li> The vanilla frangrance is fresh and natrual I usually wash my hair before bed and the vanilla scent helps to sooth to sleep.</li>
            <li> Bought a few bottles to try it for the first time.  </li>
            <li> This is the first time conditioner did not make my hair limp and lifeless.  </li>
            <li> My hair is noticeable softer after just the first few washes.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I can only say that I liked it and this will probably be only a one time purchase for me.</li>
            <li> I tried this conditioner for the first time a few weeks ago and I will never get anything else.</li>
            <li> Even though this product is not cheap, but for what it does I&#x27;m willing to pay the price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find a conditioner that works to soften without weighing down my fine hair, and this is it!</li>
            <li> I leave a little of this in my hair, not completely rinsing it, and I have shiny soft locks that have pretty individual curls after scrunching gel into it after I get out of the shower.</li>
            <li> I kept on using the conditioner and realized that it&#x27;s actually very moisturizing for my scalp and doesn&#x27;t make my scalp greasy or weigh down my hair afterwards</li>
            <li> It worked really well to keep frizz down through the day.</li>
            <li> Really people need to pipe down.</li>
            <li> I really like that it doesn&#x27;t fade my color out or feel like it&#x27;s weighing it down, either.  </li>
            <li> so it is very noticeable if I use a product that weighs down my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ready to also try some of their other products!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little more than I usually spend on conditioner</li>
            <li> I just bought our 5th bottle (although it is worth noting that a little does go a long way, however with my daughter being a swimmer, she is washing/conditioning every day</li>
            <li> just because I have dry hair.. rinsed with coldest water possible.. for frizz,.. and then blow dried with cool air.</li>
            <li> It detangles, softens and it makes my super dull hair shine.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s very dry and feels like straw, but after using this conditioner my hair has never felt so soft!  </li>
            <li> I recently switched to using shampoo bars, because I heard that conventional shampoos really damages the hair.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and would try out other products from Maple Holistics without any hesitation.</li>
            <li> Other conditioners I&#x27;ve owned only made my hair feel weighed down and full of chemicals</li>
            <li> natural conditioner is making my hair softer I also noticed that it&#x27;s not falling as much not sure</li>
            <li> Silk18 makes my hair look less brassy, and evened out the shape of the curls and made them much bouncier.</li>
            <li> I let my hair dry naturally</li>
            <li> My damaged, dry, frizzy hair comes out soft and shiny after drying.</li>
            <li> My hair is much easier to comb through and have noticed less breakage.</li>
            <li> I still have to put some natural product in my hair before letting it dry, but I expect that.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally curly, dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li> I have dry and naturally curly hair and have always bought store shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> Quality products, from a trusted company, combine to make my previously dry hair luxuriously soft and fantastically fragrant.</li>
            <li> I have naturally course, dry, curly blond hair.  </li>
            <li> so it gets oily near the roots and dry at the ends.</li>
            <li> In just one application, my hair was transformed from dry and brittle to soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> It makes my dry brittle hair feel so silky and soft.</li>
            <li> ( After using the shampoo and conditioner together I noticed my hair was very silky and seemed to have less frizz.  </li>
            <li> I only need to use a dime size amount and it completely coats my long hair with a emollient silky feel.</li>
            <li> but it is 53 year old hair and grey is starting to peak out.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I step out of the shower and damp dried my hair, then comb it and hours later still no frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> I have dry, thick, damaged hair, and always struggled with finding shampoo and conditioner that wouldn&#x27;t leave my hair even more dry.</li>
            <li> my easy to manage hair became brittle, greasy, and seriously thin.  </li>
            <li> and this isn&#x27;t a super thick formula.</li>
            <li> This conditioner made me hair extremely shiny &amp; soft!!</li>
            <li> After using this for the first time last night, the comb glided right through it and there were very few hairs in my brush after when brushing after it dried.</li>
            <li> I left it on my hair for about 2 minutes while in the shower, and the end result was my hair feeling very silky without being weighed down --</li>
            <li> Because this product doesn&#x27;t weigh down your hair and is able to soften thick unruly hair; I would recommend it for all hair types.</li>
            <li> and I was pleasantly surprised at how soft and shiny my hair was compared to when I use other conditioners!</li>
            <li> Would certainly recommend this product, though it is a little pricey...</li>
            <li> When I rinse it out, I usually leave a little in my hair, it isn&#x27;t greasy or stiff, it smells good and helps with the frizz.  </li>
            <li> (in terms of length, it&#x27;s about 3-inches below shoulder-length right now, when dried and curly) and I&#x27;m long overdue for a haircut</li>
            <li> or I may have to alternate with another natural conditioner that is less expensive, but I do really love this!  </li>
            <li> My hair is very long thin &amp; color treated too &amp; after trying many products (esp conditioners)</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and need that extra conditioner because my hair tends to be dry.</li>
            <li> I allow my hair to dry naturally to avoid heat damage and to reduce and further frizziness.</li>
            <li> It left my hair tangled, and once dry it wasn&#x27;t really soft.</li>
            <li> Also, the bottle is way too small, I have long hair, so it goes quickly.  </li>
            <li> these products work well for a week or so, but unfortunately, the tips of my hair then start getting dry and brittle, and for some reason the products aren&#x27;t effective for long-term use.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair that used to be dry and brittle until I tried this product!  </li>
            <li> could I pull the comb through the bottom 6&amp;#34; of a small section of hair without it becoming a knotted mess?</li>
            <li> I have fine and thin hair...</li>
            <li> this conditioner made my fine thin curly hair feel like burlap rope.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to see if this could work on my hair which is fine, thin and color treated.  </li>
            <li> I have natural loose curls that tend to frizz on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> /&gt;BTW - Maple Holistics offered to refund my money for the Argan Shampoo and send me a new bottle of their new and improved Argan Shampoo since I was not completely satisfied with it.  </li>
            <li> I have very dry, brittle, naturally curly 60-something hair.  </li>
            <li> But on the whole, I&#x27;ll probably switch to this one and just spritz with a little water and oil to make up the difference.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need much, just a little thermal protector, after I rinse out the Silk 18.</li>
            <li> This is the first natural conditioner that de-tangles my (long) hair, without irritating my (very sensitive) scalp.</li>
            <li> I have been trying to combat the new texture of my hair and extreme dryness.  </li>
            <li> I have fine, thin, hair and this product has totally transformed it!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the price is a bit high for an average family for the size of the product</li>
            <li> My hair is coarse , dry and long plus I live at elevation in the Rocky Mountains.  </li>
            <li> This made my very healthy hair extremely dry, so dry it was difficult to brush thru.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way, and it works SO fast!</li>
            <li> so it takes a little more time to wash thick hair thoroughly without tangling it.  </li>
            <li> I have shoulder length, very thick wavy/curly hair that two months ago I had stripped from red to light brown with highlights.</li>
            <li> But within the next few hours and overnight, I had large red welts and a rash around my jawline, chin and next to my ears.</li>
            <li> The other thing is that this conditioner really helps to moisturize my dry hair.  </li>
            <li> I have long thick wavy hair, and once upon a time in my life my hair was soft and very very shiny.</li>
            <li> The usual little frizzy hairs that go wild in the Midwest humidity are much tamer than normal.  </li>
            <li> I  have dry hair due to styling tools  my hair did become soft and stayed soft even after I washed out the conditioner.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first because it wasn&#x27;t as thick and creamy as my usual conditioner, but this stuff is awesome!  </li>
            <li> leaves hair very soft and it last longer than other cont.</li>
            <li> and I do not have to sacrifice a bad hair day to use a product that is good for my hair and skin.</li>
            <li> The formula is thick enough as to not be runny, and it still spreads evenly and smoothly throughout my wet hair.</li>
            <li> It has a nice smell to it also which is good since I hate conditioners that make my hair smell weird</li>
            <li> Normally if I blow dry and straighten my hair, it will feel very dry afterwards</li>
            <li> My hair went from being dull and frizzy to silky with the right amount of volume.</li>
            <li> Stays clean and manageable at least a week!  </li>
            <li> Hair was easy to comb through but was somewhat dry and very dull.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, wavy, long hair and noticed after use my hair felt drier and more frizzier, not soft like with other over the counter conditioners I have used; will definitely not buy again.</li>
            <li> I feel like I have soft child hair, and I already see new hair sprouting and no more flakes.</li>
            <li> I am a total canary and react to just about any chemical anything you can think of (with itching, rashes, acne: not fun), so I am always leery of trying new products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair is really thin and get frizzy fast but with this conditioner it never gets frizzy!!!</li>
            <li> I have long hair that is often dry and frizzy, this conditioner leaves my hair soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li> No matter how much conditioner I use, my hair always feels dry and frizzy -- or alternately, weighed down by goopy conditioner.</li>
            <li> Also, the smell was pleasant at first, but after a week it got very annoyingly repetitive/strong.</li>
            <li> I have an oily scalp and dry hair, and live in a very dry climate.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised with how soft my hair was after using this conditioner and didn&#x27;t feel at all heavy or flat.</li>
            <li> I also hate the way it looks and feels after I use most conditioning products that are &amp;#34;designed&amp;#34; to make it less dry and more conditioned.</li>
            <li> (I have very long hair) and you barely even need to comb afterwards</li>
            <li> The formula is safe enough to use on my delicate scalp, and it leaves my hair feeling moisturized but not particularly weighed down or sticky.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not strong and my hair smells like hair after one day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank goodness for Amazon reviews that allow a person to really research a product before purchasing it.</li>
            <li> I usually use a hair mask once a week because I have dry hair, and I have been only doing that every other week because this product works fabulously.  </li>
            <li> I am also now hooked on finding other natural products to replace the my current ones.</li>
            <li> I switched over to using this combination after having tried several other shampoos and conditioners - some natural,</li>
            <li> The only reason this product received 4 stars and not 5 stars was cost ($14 seems just a little high).  </li>
            <li> I have an all natural conditioner that is paraben free, sulfate free, with no dyes or artificial fragrances or dyes, AND no animal testing!!</li>
            <li> I had long hair when I was a teenager in the early seventies until I went in the Air Force,then good-by long hair, in fact good-by hair all together!!.  </li>
            <li> I have very coarse, dry, hair (being a red head - we have very dry hair naturally).</li>
            <li> Only negative which is a personal opinion is the fragrance smell is a little too strong for me.</li>
            <li> Before these 2 products, various shampoo and conditioner I tried used to leave my hair dry and frizzy, and I used to loose natural texture of my hairs.</li>
            <li> Silk 18 made my curls defined and shiny, but not soft, and the Tresemme made my hair soft but undefined and not particularly shiny</li>
            <li> I was nervous to buy another natural haircare product after trying something I found at Whole Foods that left my hair tangled, dull and dry like straw.</li>
            <li> As a young man, I have long curly hair and also because of very dry weather here</li>
            <li> Looking forward to trying their other natural products.</li>
            <li> I used to washed my hair every day, but because of this natural product I wash it every other day.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair quite soft, and not feeling greasy like some other conditioners might do.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair extremely manageable and soft.</li>
            <li> I have used other natural brands before</li>
            <li> I tried Silk 18 Natural Conditioner based on reviews by other curly haired women and decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> As I often have problems with my hair (damaged due to enviromental factors), I decided to try this natural conditioner which is known to repair damaged hair.</li>
            <li> My hair was surprisingly soft  when other products didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> everything else I&#x27;ve tried does (even other natural products).</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair so soft and manageable, unlike all the other products I have found.  </li>
            <li> unlike other store-bought conditioners...is natural and not &amp;</li>
            <li> I have used other natural conditioners before, and those did practically nothing.</li>
            <li> Also it doesn&#x27;t make me break out like the other products, I assume because is all natural.</li>
            <li> To me, there are other natural conditioners that&#x27;s not a pain to use.</li>
            <li> I have been coloring it for years, flat ironing and blow drying daily, and it has taken a toll.  </li>
            <li> I noticed that my hair is fuller looking after use and also that it seems to act as similarly to Biosilk for flat ironing.  </li>
            <li> I actually didn&#x27;t even have to flat iron after using this conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have found my new go to conditioner for my thick natural hair!  </li>
            <li> The ingredients in the conditioner are very gentle and a small amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I purchased a few organic products from stores like whole foods and whatnot, but they only left my hair dry and tangled.</li>
            <li> You only need a little bit and it easily spreads through my thick curly hair.</li>
            <li> only complaint is that the vanilla fragrance is a little strong, but after a day it fades away.</li>
            <li> the quality of the products made by this company but this particular shampoo left my hair feeling a bit limp and flat.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a typical &amp;#34;squeeze&amp;#34; bottle -- more of a hard plastic that I need to thrust into my hand and hope that a lot of product doesn&#x27;t get wasted as it shoots unpredictably out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> After using it, my hair isn&#x27;t any softer or smoother or better conditioned than less expensive natural conditioners out there.</li>
            <li> Nothing I&#x27;ve tried has worked well for this long, and I&#x27;ve tried things from the inexpensive Garnier Fructis Sleek &amp; Shine to the more expensive Wen Fig and a lot in between.  </li>
            <li> My hair felt soft and silky, but not too soft to hold a curl with my usual styling routine (which includes a styling product).</li>
            <li> My only issue is that my hair is not only curly but long.</li>
            <li> This is actually the second product i got from Maple Holistics a long with their Sage shampoo.</li>
            <li> My hair is normal type, it is not straight, yet not really wavy.</li>
            <li> BUT just for some time upon drying it was very dry and dull and same as any other regular drug store brand conditioner&#x27;s so basically the overhype of the product is for a FREE product....</li>
            <li> My hair is less tangled, and very soft.</li>
            <li> My hair feels very soft after using and I notice less frizz.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my hair very soft and less fizzy.  </li>
            <li> I recently decided to embrace my curls and was looking for a conditioner that wouldn&#x27;t weigh down my hair, but would still leave my curls soft and handle the frizziness.</li>
            <li> The shampoo definitely took the oily appearance out of my hair and I applied this stuff only to the tips of my hair and not my scalp, it left my hair soft and now I don&#x27;t have to worry about my hair drying out or producing excess oil because it&#x27;s dried out.</li>
            <li> My hair is very thick and full bodied</li>
            <li> I also noticed since using this that my hair dries faster, whether blow or air drying which for my super thick hair is something!</li>
            <li> I was using a conventional salon brand because I couldn&#x27;t find a natural conditioner that would</li>
            <li> I only used this 2 times and my dry hair suddenly got softer, shinier and healthier!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have awful dry hair and this has been great for me!</li>
            <li> The only downside I&#x27;ve noticed after using this conditioner along with the dry hair and and flaking scalp shampoo from the same company is that it leaves quite a bit of flyaway hair.</li>
            <li> After the birth of my second son, my hair totally changed and my scalp became dry.</li>
            <li> Pay attention to that last remark as I have the propensity for oily hair while at the same time it&#x27;s dry and brittle from highlighting it.  </li>
            <li> I am a Caucasian male with very coarse, frizzy, dry hair.</li>
            <li> I had major dry scalp problems when I moved to a dry climate.</li>
            <li> Conditioners either typically weigh my hair down, making it limp and flat, or conditioners are too light, essentially doing nothing.</li>
            <li> I appreciated that the small card that comes with the product informs you: &amp;#34;Shampoo is for the scalp</li>
            <li> and I feel like my whole body is slick and silky.  </li>
            <li> Very hydrating but not too heavy - doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy the day after I wash it!</li>
            <li> Fragrance is enchanting, conditions well with just a small amount and the hair is so much softer.</li>
            <li> not sure if it is the shampoo or the conditioner), is that my hair seems very static-y, which has never been a problem before.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my hair shiny and manageable and doesn&#x27;t make it flat or oily looking.</li>
            <li> Also, I have a feeling that the bottle will last a long time.  </li>
            <li> One bottle will be last a long time.</li>
            <li> my hair  and cause it to look flat.  </li>
            <li> but with those products it goes flat in a day or so.</li>
            <li> so I think the bottle will last a long time, too.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something that worked but didn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling flat.</li>
            <li> I only gave it 4 stars because I can&#x27;t comment on the product&#x27;s performance over a long period of time yet.</li>
            <li> I used this product is slot of times, It treated my hair because it was damaged for coloring it and the flat iron.</li>
            <li> I leave it in my hair as long as possible.  </li>
            <li> I normally leave my conditioner in for a few minutes then rinse it out.</li>
            <li> Hello there, I have sensitive scalp, curly hair, thin hair, my hair get very tangle, and it comes out easily, in only 2 weeks</li>
            <li> I wouldn’t say that it makes my hair silky (although my hair has rarely ever been “silky” in its life…it’s just too thick!), but it is DEFINITELY smoother.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not BAD, but it&#x27;s not great also.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a bad hair but this &amp;#34;silk&amp;#34; makes it very flat , unmanageable, and very static.</li>
            <li> My hair feels soft and manageable after using it with out weighing it down.  </li>
            <li> This conditioner helps my hair feel silky and soft without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> I tried the Silk 18 Natural Conditioner and it&#x27;s done wonders to extending the life of my blowout without weighing down my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is so soft and shiny now and this doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft and shiny without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair soft without weighing it down, and increases the shine, too.  </li>
            <li> Keeps my hair soft, well hydrated without weighing it down or making it greasy.  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel so soft without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> This made my hair soft and silky without weighing down.</li>
            <li> If you use too much your hair is very very limp.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, long, very straight hair, and this conditioner does just the trick.</li>
            <li> I will definitely repurchase as long as maple holistics continues making this product!</li>
            <li> and it did not go flat even after two days!</li>
            <li> In fact, the vanilla scent is only a bit strong while your using the conditioner in the shower, but afterwards, the scent becomes very subtle and I don&#x27;t smell it at all, once I put in my other hair</li>
            <li> I am also very sensitive to products that weigh my hair down and this product doesn&#x27;t seem to do that at all!  </li>
            <li> And the smell last for days, I have very long hair.</li>
            <li> I like that it is a more of natural shampoo that doesn&#x27;t have a lot of added or bad ingredients in it.</li>
            <li> I have a dry and coarse hair and as per my friends suggestions I started using this.its been almost 3 months</li>
            <li> I recently bleached my hair and didn&#x27;t like the feel of the dry brassy feeling.  </li>
            <li> It instantly got rid of my dry tangled winter hair.</li>
            <li> I then brushed my hair, crimp-dried it with a towel, and then let it air dry.</li>
            <li> It was frizzy, dry and totally unmanageable.  </li>
            <li> After applying it, my hair felt soft and less frizzy.</li>
            <li> , I felt like it did not do anything to my hair, but I dyed my hair last month and it became horribly dry, and when I used this omg</li>
            <li> I considered chopping off my hair because it had become dry, lifeless, fragile and brittle.</li>
            <li> Obviously, if I don&#x27;t use conditioner, my hair gets extremely dry.</li>
            <li> THAT ACTUALLY WORK I CAN GO TO WASHING MY HAIR EVERYOTHER DAY WITHOUT USING DRY SHAMPOO AND LOOKING</li>
            <li> I have Southeast Asian hair that is exceptionally dry and prone to knotting.  </li>
            <li> Not a lot of conditioners work well on my curly, frizzy, dry hair, but this is really different.</li>
            <li> Left it dry and unmanageable.</li>
            <li> Does what it is suppose to do made my hair soft much less frizzy.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t come out as soft as with my previous conditioner.</li>
            <li> This leaves my hair soft and less brittle.</li>
            <li> My hair feels soft again and gets less tangles.</li>
            <li> My hair is double processed and tends to be dry.</li>
            <li> It was simple to blow dry ,y hair after using this conditioner.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my hair silky soft and easy to manage, even in the cold dry winter air.</li>
            <li> I have been coloring, using heating products for years &amp; this caused my hair to be dry &amp; coarse.  </li>
            <li> So - yes this company does ask those who purchase to leave a review and in return you get a free product, BUT if you hated the product why would you want a free one?</li>
            <li> I tried this conditioner with shampoo for dry hair and flaking scalp in the hope of healing peeling, itchy open sores that  </li>
            <li> I had a several dry hair when I moved to California two months ago, dehydrate, hair scalp, hair loss and itchy.</li>
            <li> My hair is so soft now and has less breakage.</li>
            <li> I have only been using it for a few days so far</li>
            <li> my hair has become over the last few months, and decided that I wanted to go the all natural route to begin to heal my hair.</li>
            <li> 8oz doesn&#x27;t last long with long hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also get it bleached/dyed blonde (my hair is normally black), and I know what you are picturing, overall it&#x27;s just not that pretty usually.</li>
            <li> I have only used a few times so far as I just received but my hair felt softer/smoother immediately.</li>
            <li> My hair is thin and most conditioners leave my hair feeling heavy and greasy.</li>
            <li> I have thin, frizzy hair that also gets greasy quickly.</li>
            <li> This product goes a long way, only takes a little to completely condition my hair.  </li>
            <li> I also noticed a big difference in how soft my hair was after using this conditioner and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I will now go back and purchase the limited edition winter shampoo also.  </li>
            <li> not only do you see every single one..</li>
            <li> After moving to NYC in the winter I found my hair even dryer than normal and my scalp becoming to dry out fairly badly which I put down to a complete lack of any humidity in this part of the world during the winter</li>
            <li> This conditioner has helped me wear my hair natural and not feel like a frizzy lion mane mess.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s been through the ringer over the last couple of years, going dark brown, back to blonde</li>
            <li> After the shower, I lightly wrapped my hair in a jersey-knit t-shirt until it was a little less damp, then air dried it the rest of the way.  </li>
            <li> Ok, I am going to let you in on a little secret, I did some research on line about what causes your hair and skin to dry out like it does.</li>
            <li> (for my long, course, curly/wavy hair) is to wash w/ diluted Dr Bronner&#x27;s soap, apply conditioner and rinse, and then use some of the same conditioner as a leave-in when I get out of the shower, and let my hair air dry.  </li>
            <li> At first I was a bit sceptic because my hair is so thick and dry</li>
            <li> Now it&#x27;s soft with tight curls that aren&#x27;t gressy .</li>
            <li> I was looking for a natural product for dry hair, my hair feels less dry after just one use of this conditioner (combined with the Argan shampoo of the same brand).</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use it until a couple days later as I was finishing up the last of my other conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I prefer to only wash my hair twice a week, and have found that with this combination, my hair doesn&#x27;t seem to need a washing as often as with some other commercial shampoos/conditioners.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other deep conditioners and this product is somewhere in the middle for quality.</li>
            <li> For reference, I have shoulder-blade length, thin, fine, wavy hair with little damage but fragile.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally very dry and coarse</li>
            <li> use this treatment on my very dry coarse hair</li>
            <li> the opposite made it very dry and straw like feeling..</li>
            <li> I understand the product is highly/purely natural, however it does little as a conditioner.</li>
            <li> I was initially worried about the vanilla scent because I was afraid I might smell like a birthday cake, but this is a nice perfumy vanilla - not a sickly sweet type.</li>
            <li> I put this silk 18 conditioner in hoping it would help a little and to my udder shock and relief my hair felt silky soft as I smoothed it through.</li>
            <li> I have only found a couple of conditioners that I can use and then comb through my hair without too much trouble when it&#x27;s wet, but then I wanted to go all Natural!  </li>
            <li> Finally, and this was the deal-breaker for me, it actively made my hair fall out--though only in the shower while rinsing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very fragrant and will dull out post-shower.</li>
            <li> This conditioner leaves my hair feeling silky soft and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> My mother has been hoarding tons of shampoos and conditioners from Costco (it’s hard for a lady to resist those prices hahaha)</li>
            <li> When I tried Silk 18 conditioner for the first time, I kept my expectations low but the result I got was unbelievable!!  </li>
            <li> The bottle is a bit hard to squeeze, and there are no real directions on the bottle, but then again conditioner is pretty self explanatory.</li>
            <li> It looks great on your hair while it is wet, but when it dries, it leave a dull whiteish residue in your hair and scalp, makes your hair look dirty.  </li>
            <li> I do not usually blow dry my hair for everyday wear but let it dry naturally which sometimes looks a little disheveled -  and today after using this conditioner</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive for the amount you get but all these sulfate free etc.</li>
            <li> I have been using Silk18 for a couple months now at least and it really lives up to it&#x27;s name.</li>
            <li> I like this stuff and the Degrease Shampoo which works pretty well on my ridiculous dry (and somehow still greasy) curly hair.</li>
            <li> To me, it smells like a cheap fake vanilla candle.  </li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t want to negative review.</li>
            <li> Living near the ocean, it usually feels coarse with a puffy unkept appearance not matter what I do to it.  </li>
            <li> I look for products that are natural and don&#x27;t have harsh chemicals or toxicity.</li>
            <li> minor thing you should know</li>
            <li> I have long hair color treated hair</li>
            <li> I will see how it works in the long run, but at this point I intend to continue using these for long.  </li>
            <li> a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;This will be in my shower for a long time.</li>
            <li> Since my hair started turning grey, it has changed texture, become thinner and finer.</li>
            <li> bottle is disappointingly small and quite pricey (per ounce) compared to my normal 20-33 ounce bottles of thickener conditioner, so I am using this conditioner once or twice a week.</li>
            <li> As long as Silk18 is produced, we will buy it.</li>
            <li> It instantly detangles my hair in the shower and feels silky when wet.</li>
            <li> Its really not the same!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried that leave a strange oily residue.  </li>
            <li> I got this and tried it a few times so far.</li>
            <li> I have long hair</li>
            <li> My daughter has medium long hair</li>
            <li> I have long hair.</li>
            <li> no frizz for a long time.</li>
            <li> This conditioner exacerbated my tangles and my hair got unmanageable after only two tries.  </li>
            <li> my hair and I plan to stay with you for a long time.</li>
            <li> I have been using shampoo with no conditioner for a long time.</li>
            <li> I let it sit as long as I can,</li>
            <li> (I know that sounds strange).</li>
            <li> I have long curly/wavy medium texture, sometimes frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li> A quarter size is truly enough for my mid-length hair worked through the ends of my hair with a wide tooth comb.  </li>
            <li> I guessed at how long to keep it on my hair (5 minutes) and it seemed to do the job.</li>
            <li> My daighter, who has long, wavy/frizzy hair loves it too.</li>
            <li> Well, it didnt take long to find out my hair was not what it used to be.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t leave it on that long either because here in California we are in a drought</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t leave it on that long either because here in California we are in a drought</li>
            <li> Lots of brushing helps to make it feel softer, but not for long before it feels a bit course again.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few weeks now and it has made my bleached/damaged hair soft again.</li>
            <li> I have long, curly hair that gets knotty.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with an itchy, flaky scalp for as long as I can remember.</li>
            <li> Bottle was smaller than I expected, but it does leave my hair softer and smoother.</li>
            <li> I have tried so may different products and spent a fortune on my hair.</li>
            <li> I have to mist or wet some areas to get them to lie back in place.  </li>
            <li> It does not have the harsh chemicals so it leaves my hair so soft.</li>
            <li> As long as this conditioner is around I will never buy anything else.</li>
            <li> I will be using these two products together for as long as I can.</li>
            <li> Not natural or holistic like at all.</li>
            <li> It is mid-back long and it takes a lot of conditioner to cover all that hair</li>
            <li> and i don&#x27;t have long hair</li>
            <li> I get asked all the time how long it took to style my hair.</li>
            <li> I would consider buying it again for this purpose, but it will depend on how long I can get</li>
            <li> I have long hair and it helps with detangling</li>
            <li> After a few uses of this natural conditioner I noticed a significance difference in texture and feel of my hair.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and finding a product I can use consistently has been difficult.  </li>
            <li> and I really like a thick conditioner that I can comb through in the shower as well as after its rinsed out.</li>
            <li> Really moisturizes my hair that is thick, curly and wiry.</li>
            <li> I have thick and frizzy hair that is very susceptible to breakage.</li>
            <li> I have extremely thick hair, I often clog shower drain because I shed so much.</li>
            <li> My hair is extremely thick, and as a consequence, can get very frizzy.</li>
            <li> This conditioner has a lovely, subtle vanilla scent, and while it is a bit costly, I have found that using only a very small dollop is enough, and I expect this small bottle to last several weeks/months.  </li>
            <li> My hair is now nearly down to my mid back</li>
            <li> The only down side is that II wish they made a bigger bottle with a pump.</li>
            <li> I was searching for a conditioner which could deep condition but at the same time does not weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li> After using Silk 18 Natural Conditioner, I notice my hair is exponentially less frizzy!</li>
            <li> natural salon quality haircare for less!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t go as far as it give out bad odor, but it is just too strong.  </li>
            <li> Helps with static during the cold and dry winter in Minnesota.  </li>
            <li> The next time I used much less, mixed a bit with water, combed through, and had non-greasy results.  </li>
            <li> I use much less conditioner (and products) overall than when I was using the bigger brand name products.</li>
            <li> But as far as everyday I can just shower and air dry.</li>
            <li> I am of mixed heritage ( black and white).</li>
            <li> My long hair is not easy to keep soft, as it is also color treated.</li>
            <li> After using it multiple times, my hair would break less when I brushed it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have time to blow dry my hair last night and fell asleep with it slightly wet.</li>
            <li> I have very curly, thick, dry hair.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve started having less trouble with dandruff, which tends to be an issue for me in the Spring and the Fall), AND my curls are much easier to style.</li>
            <li> Although when rinsing it out my hair did feel silky, upon drying my hair felt very dry and flat.</li>
            <li> My hair has been damaged and dried out by chemical treatments to the extreme and just when I thought it wAs beyond repair I tried this stuff and my hair actually laid down instead of sticking straight up.</li>
            <li> I have fine, thin hair with little to no volume.</li>
            <li> I have been coloring my hair for a few years just to cover the grey and only recently began to get highlights to offset my very dark natural hair color.  </li>
            <li> I have long wavy hair that is on the dry side</li>
            <li> I was super skeptical as everything &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; seems to dry out and damage my hair even further.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got thick, somewhat coarse hair and this conditioner softens it up like no other conditioner I have used and there is no greasy residue left over.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I purposely didn&#x27;t use the leave-in argan oil conditioner I have always used in the past and even without it my hair is very soft and easier to work with - no frizzies and not wiry feeling.  </li>
            <li> After first use the difference from the commercial conditioner I was using was dramatic.</li>
            <li> I have tried other conditioners and with these others, my hair feels brittle and coarse.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even style my hair the same when i have used other conditioners.</li>
            <li> I was trying carols daughter and several other products with hopes that one would suffice.</li>
            <li> Silk18 has just replaced the only other conditioner I will buy over and over again.</li>
            <li> It left my hair extremely silky and with volume.</li>
            <li> I returned to familiar (&amp; expensive) non-natural products but my desire to ditch the chemicals</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve definitely noticed a difference, wish the bottle was a little bigger.</li>
            <li> Other conditioners left my hair frizzy during the day and just not as shiny.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely buy this product again and plan to try other products from Maple Holistics.</li>
            <li> That says a lot because I&#x27;m caucasian with long course curly hair so to have a plus plus in every category is, or has been unheard of....up until now!</li>
            <li> If it is, it is mixed with other smell.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be using this for a long time!</li>
            <li> And I only put a little of this stuff on and only on my ends.</li>
            <li> She will definitely buy this conditioner again and try other shampoos by Maple Holistics.</li>
            <li> I will keep on using this products as long as I can afford it!</li>
            <li> I usually leave it in my hair for several minutes to get that extra benefit of a deep condoner!</li>
            <li> I had been having problems with my hair due to me bleaching it last year and it seemed like</li>
            <li> I use only every other day.</li>
            <li> I have been using it as a deep conditioner that I use about once every other week.</li>
            <li> After styling as usual, I was amazed by how silky, shiny, and soft my hair was!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to go back to other conditioners when I run out of this one because they never really help my hair that much.</li>
            <li> AND I can use FAR less of it than with other conditioners.  </li>
            <li> I had switched back to my other hair product after finishing the first bottle because I was not very impressed by the shampoo/conditioner.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t leave it in that very long (about 2 minutes while I shave)</li>
            <li> I like the vanilla smell, and I like that the bottle lasts a very long time even when I use it every day (and I have A LOT of hair for a guy).</li>
            <li> I have very long hair, but a dime to quarter-sized amount is all that I need to saturate my ends.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my granddaughter who has very long,  curly, frizzy hair.  </li>

            <li> , a small amount goes a long way and my hair turns out soft.</li>
            <li> My husband has curly hair and didn&#x27;t find this to be hydrating enough for him without using like a tenth of the bottle, and even then, found that he needed to rely heavily on a leave-in product in order for his curls to be hydrated enough.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Asian with black, thick and straight hair.</li>
            <li> Even while applying it, I could tell my hair was getting soft, which is naturally thick and coarse.</li>
            <li> I can imagine that if you have thick coarse hair you would swoon to have it soft and silky</li>
            <li> Second, my thick hair feels really soft and manageable when dry.</li>
            <li> I am in my mid 40&#x27;s have naturally wavy hair, fairly thick</li>
            <li> I spent a few months near the ocean</li>
            <li> natural.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very very excited to try this conditioner due to my history of nasty reactions to most drug store type everyday hair care items.  </li>
            <li> My hair is long and was very dry when my friend gave me some to try..</li>
            <li> Now my boyfriend has long (for a guy) think, curly, and very dry hair.</li>
            <li> When I use normal conditioner my hair becomes dry and dull.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended, at least to try to see if it works with your hair type.</li>
            <li> I have used it for about a little over a week my hair is very soft and not weighed down.</li>
            <li> and I have not had a single breakout on my scalp or neck since using this.</li>
            <li> It left my hair feeling stiff and like a waxy residue was left on it.</li>
            <li> (I usually let my hair dry naturally).  </li>
            <li> With previous conditioners, my hair either felt weighed down or felt completely parched and dry.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t get dry skin/scalp, but for some reason this winter has been killing me so far.</li>
            <li> I have thick coarse hair that is extremely dry from coloring, styling tools and a health issue and have several different brands on condtioner and not one came close to how this one conditioned my hair.</li>
            <li> The conditioner will not have a dramatic effect on your hair right away</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and dry, and I live in a dry climate</li>
            <li> Before my hair was dry, frizzy, and extremely dry, but after using this product, all of my hair problems were gone!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t read the product information close and was a bit surprised with the size of the bottle (small).</li>
            <li> I have medium curls and fairly coarse textured dark hair with highlights.</li>
            <li> and i used a small amount of this conditioner and my hair was so soft.</li>
            <li> My hair is soft, shiny, and fluffy!</li>
            <li> Unless you&#x27;re hell-bent on completely natural products, it&#x27;s no better than anything you could by at walmart.</li>
            <li> Its not worth it especially at this price.</li>
            <li> The combination of my hair type and the natural soap was making my hair unmanageable, and I was not satisfied with how it felt or looked.</li>
            <li> A small amount goes far, I use about a quarter size and have med-long hair, just below my shoulders.</li>
            <li> After a couple of days of using this conditioner, I noticed the effect it had had on smoothing the hair cuticle and minimizing split ends so that my hair wasn&#x27;t nearly as frizzy as it usually is without styling gel.</li>
            <li> For the past year, it has been trial and error process for me as I tried all natural hair products...</li>
            <li> I thought it was a bit expensive but after using Maple Holistics I&#x27;m a true fan.</li>
            <li> The ends are still a bit frizzy but again, its probably because I have long hair and go to sleep with it wet.</li>
            <li> My daughter-in-law had died and left behind a baby that was only 8 months old.  </li>
            <li> The natural conditioner made my dead limp hair come back to life.  </li>
            <li> I have only used Silk 18 three times so far but my hair feels like silk, my curls are not frizzy and weighted down like they usually are</li>
            <li> I also have dry (like very dry) hair</li>
            <li> I usually buy my shampoo and conditioner in the large salon size pump bottles because I have such long, thick hair that I end up using a lot just.  </li>
            <li> The ingredients here are natural and not harmful to one&#x27;s hair -- reason enough to put serious thought into ordering this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Seriously, it sounds cheesy, but when I put it on, I feel my hair kind of relax and breathe a sigh of relief.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s the only conditioner that didn&#x27;t weigh it down after using.</li>
            <li> Only one down side for me is the feeling of my hair after using it.</li>
            <li> they either make me want to gag or track down a bakery, because why on earth would you want to smell like a cookie or cinnamon roll, unless you have constant access to those desserts???)</li>
            <li> Look further down my hair length</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the price is high for such a small amount, which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.  </li>
            <li> I am never going back to any other conditioner again!</li>
            <li> It took me a long time to find this conditioner!!</li>
            <li> I have very dry and thin bleached hair, when i&#x27;m washing my hair with silk18 conditioner and argan oil shampoo at first</li>
            <li> little bit goes a long way, I could see this bottle easily lasting months.</li>
            <li> have thin, dry, long hair that is very prone to tangling.  </li>
            <li> now so 1 bottle lasts a very long time!</li>
            <li> My hair is a &amp;#34;hot mess&amp;#34; with the New England weather and the fact that I am not kind to my hair at all by coloring and highlights</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s way too hard and doesn&#x27;t squeeze very well upside down.</li>
            <li> I needed a leave-in conditioner because my hair was breaking off because it was so incredibly DRY!  </li>
            <li> I tried this conditioner for my toddler who has extremely dry hair, to the point of every morning she wakes up with dreadlocks!  </li>
            <li> When he uses the degrees-er shampoo, I don&#x27;t have to use dry shampoo on his hair!  </li>
            <li> No harmful additives to dry out and damage hair!</li>
            <li> My hair felt horribly dry and doll like!</li>
            <li> It makes my frizzy dry hair feel supersoft and look and feel bouncy!</li>
            <li> Usually I have an entire process of drying, de-frizzing, twisting and adding leave in product and oil to have lasting results.  </li>
            <li> I also noticed unlike with typical commercial conditioners, there isn&#x27;t any gunk build-up in the shower</li>
            <li> Typically I will only use a conditioner on the ends because it leaves my scalp area</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t see half the bottle because I want it to last.</li>
            <li> I was unable to locate the exact label with a list of ingredients prior to purchasing.</li>
            <li> (so I hope they keep plenty in stock!)&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, if you, like me, don&#x27;t mind spending a little extra as long as you get what your paying for, give this a try!</li>
            <li> I stumbled upon it looking for a remedy for my aged, dry and brittle hair.  </li>
            <li> Even my hairdresser commented when I went in last that my hair was stronger and my scalp less irritated.  </li>
            <li> All my life I&#x27;ve been a typical male when it comes to washing one&#x27;s hair</li>
            <li> I am an Asian woman in her twenties with shoulder-length black hair.  </li>
            <li> Usually the only reason to add aroma is to cover up another smell, which might be the only way to screw up a vanilla smell.  </li>
            <li> The lower half, and especially the ends, were looking rather dry and rough.</li>
            <li> It also leaves it super silly</li>
            <li> It hardly justifies the very high price paid for such a small bottle.</li>
            <li> However, it does work on dry hair for a little extra moisture.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this item because it contained all of the ingredients that typically leave my hair soft, shiny and less dry:  keratin, panthenol and silk amino acids among other desirable contents.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and was looking for something that wasn&#x27;t harsh and would not weigh down my ringlets.</li>
            <li> This makes my dry, dull hair look and feel soft, shiny, and moisturized.  </li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical, simply because I have made many shopping mistakes online, and ended up with a product that didn&#x27;t work as well as it said it did, thus with less money, and thus with a feeling of disappointment.</li>
            <li> After bleaching my hair three times, my hair was very dry and felt like hay.</li>
            <li> I have very dry hair</li>
            <li> My hair feels very dry.</li>
            <li> so it was very dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> I have very dry hair and scalp.</li>
            <li> (when used with the Sage shampoo, which can make my scalp very dry).</li>
            <li> I have very dry, damaged hair and</li>
            <li> If you have very dry hair, I suggest you give it a try.  </li>
            <li> I have very dry, curly hair, and the underneath layer is always the driest to the point of being crunchy and way too curly.</li>
            <li> I use to have very dry hair</li>
            <li> hair quality is very dry and after using this product i can see lots of improvement in my hair quality and i can feel softness in my hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I color my hair every month and it gets very dry and brittle</li>
            <li> I was looking for an All-Natural Conditioner that would moisturize very dry hair.</li>
            <li> I have very dry, brittle  hair,i have tried almost every condition known to man..</li>
            <li> I have very dry, color treated hair.  </li>
            <li> my hair has been very dry.</li>
            <li> Her hair was very dry and frizzy.  </li>
            <li> This left my hair a mess:</li>
            <li> I have tried every possible conditioner ever made for my hair, expensive or cheap they never really satisfied my needs....until now.  </li>
            <li> This was exciting for me because I was concerned that the small size of the bottle would mean I had to purchase it quite often.</li>
            <li> would highly recommend this product to anyone with thick hair as I can&#x27;t speak for any other type of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She commented on how soft and silky my very long thick wavy hair is.</li>
            <li> My hair is very long and at the ends it is dead and coarse.</li>
            <li> May be it works for curly hair to flat them down but</li>
            <li> This conditioner leaves my thick, coarse, chemically treated hair soft and silky without being heavy, in fact I use far less of this conditioner than I did with my previous conditioners.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair hair down to the middle of my back, and this bottle lasted me a month, and I am now ordering my second bottle!</li>
            <li> First off, I have VERY long, thick hair, well past my waist.</li>
            <li> I color my hair about every six weeks, and being blonde is super tough on the hair!!  </li>
            <li> I do have SUPER sensitive, acne prone skin, so I&#x27;m not terribly surprised, just disappointed.</li>
            <li> This product left my hair softer and didn&#x27;t weigh it down like other conditioners can.</li>
            <li> but since I only have to use a little, the price works out in the end.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve only been using it for a little over a week.</li>
            <li> I left it in a little longer on what it said on the bottle.</li>
            <li> I might have preferred it to be a little lighter but it is milder and doesn&#x27;t last on my hair which I like.</li>
            <li> What is up with this tiny little bottle.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have oily hair so need only a little bit.  </li>
            <li> The product came with a neat little information card that explained some of the key ingredients and how your hair will benefit.  </li>
            <li> This is the only conditioner that makes my childrens tangles fall out with little brushing effort.</li>
            <li> The smell is a soft vanilla, slight coconut smell and it not strong as some reviewers said.  </li>
            <li> As a desert dweller, my hair can dry out very quickly if not nourished properly, especially if I am out in the heat or the pool.  </li>
            <li> My hair is dry and damaged due to coloring and heat styling.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have stated, this made my hair incredibly dry.</li>
            <li> It is hard for me to find a conditioner that works well and that leaves my hair soft.</li>
            <li> she likes it, hardly any hair in her comb and the hair feels soft.</li>
            <li> The bottle is a bit hard for old hands to squeeze, but not a deal breaker.  </li>
            <li> Hard to find products that are all natural AND work well,</li>
            <li> At the very least I would like it to be soft; I have used multiple products just for this reason alone.</li>
            <li> I have blue hair that is extremely hard to keep blue.</li>
            <li> I have very dark brown hair that is bleached &amp; highlighted blonde.</li>
            <li> Despite the possible fake positive reviews for this product (see my other review), I still went ahead and ordered it.</li>
            <li> but it honestly wasn&#x27;t too bad once my hair dried.</li>
            <li> In terms of how my hair feels, I enjoy knowing that I&#x27;m not using artificial chemicals on it.</li>
            <li> I have been trying a lot of natural products lately including</li>
            <li> There are a &amp;#34;few places” that are recently obtaining silk ethically but it is “very&amp;#34; expensive:</li>
            <li> /&gt;Honestly, my only complaint is that I wish they had a bigger size of this.  </li>
            <li> (I find that the Wet Paddle Brush helps to spread evenly without pulling, stretching, and breaking wet</li>
            <li> and so I have to be careful what products I use.  </li>
            <li> Used store brought conditioner but never really gave me the softness like this conditioner gave me.</li>
            <li> I distribute it evenly with a wide tooth comb and put it up with a hair clip while I carried on washing my face, etc</li>
            <li> No frizzy or rough hair after my shampoo and condition.</li>
            <li> and I always experience itchiness after a few hours of using different shampoo/conditioner</li>
            <li> Blow drying my hair is a nightmare- unless it&#x27;s using a diffuser and careful hand movements, don&#x27;t even think about it.</li>
            <li> but it seems that my brother loves it too as the bottle is nearly empty</li>
            <li> I just spent $20 on a so so conditioner.</li>
            <li> I wash her her once or twice a week and sometimes just wet it and put this conditioner on it.</li>
            <li> Big waste of money.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to get quite a few washes in before I left a review</li>
            <li> The price is what is expected for a product with quality ingredients</li>
            <li> After only a few uses I could tell there was a difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is thin and very frizzy.</li>
            <li> Hope not much product was lost.</li>
            <li> I have spent untold amounts of money over the years on hair conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this conditioner for a few days and here is what is does and doesn&#x27;t do for my hair.  </li>
            <li> , few peoples ask me what I do to my hair, I told them I finally find my shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li> no thanks.</li>
            <li> I had used the same conditioner for a few years and was looking for a change.</li>
            <li> I have read the ingredients over and over and really do not know how or why this happens.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m curious to see how it handles my curls after my blowout wears off.</li>
            <li> It is medium length, about mid-shoulder blades when wet.  </li>
            <li> so use carefully if you&#x27;ve got color-treated hair.</li>
            <li> I also use a mask with it but only leave it on a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> I have only been using is for a few days now</li>
            <li> It leaves behind a faint but lovely vanilla aroma, so I don&#x27;t need to put on any extra fragrance when I go to work.</li>
            <li> Before start using this one, I had a lot of split end of hairs, now I have only few.</li>
            <li> The majority of silk production is not vegan and not ethically harvested.</li>
            <li> Both the &amp;#34;long&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;curled&amp;#34; present challenges because it can look dried out from the curling iron,</li>
            <li> To help others who review this product, I am listing the actual ingredients: Water, Aloe Barbadenis Leaf, Cetaeryl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Chloride, Glycerin, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Livate, Phytokeratin, Proppanediol, Caprylic Capric Triglyceride, Argan Oil, Shea Butter, Certified Organic Blend Pomegranate, Hibiscus, Green Tea and Sea Buckthorn, Silk Amino Acids, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Phenoxyethanol, Potassium Sorbate.</li>
            <li> However with the company be holistic, this is to be expected.  </li>
            <li> I just start by washing my hair with shampoo, rinse, wet my loofah and turn the shower off.</li>
            <li> I just start by washing my hair with shampoo, rinse, wet my loofah and turn the shower off.</li>
            <li> In the last few months I have been working with a doctor to balance my hormones.</li>
            <li> The shampoo im not very fond of</li>
            <li> I have only used it a few times but my hair already feels a lot softer and smoother.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this conditioner for only a few days</li>
            <li> After few trials and solid evidence I stopped using it.</li>
            <li> Watery consistency, not very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I too was curious at the tidal wave of 5 stars.  </li>
            <li> not really anything speacial</li>
            <li> Gives me the feeling of having an incense over my head, I expected a nicer vanilla smell</li>
            <li> Refreshed, hydrated, moisturized hair, minus the residue.</li>
            <li> I had resigned myself to the no-&#x27;poo method, which was removing my blonde highlights, but when I recently returned to Florida and had to go back to using the horrible chlorine/chloramine-treated water here, no-&#x27;poo just wasn&#x27;t working any more... and my scalp was irritated and itchy, to boot.  </li>
            <li> I have spent years trying dozens of &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; conditioners.  </li>
            <li> I have course thick hair with natural texture</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve been using it, my hair feels so soft and silky, my extensions don&#x27;t feel dried out or dead.</li>
            <li> I have thick and coarse red hair.</li>
            <li> I have bra band length coarse, thick, naturally curly, dark brown hair that has been highlighted for the past two years and is now mostly blonde.  </li>
            <li> I hate to say it, but it reminds me of the warm deliciousness of pancakes on a Sunday morning when you haven&#x27;t eaten in a day or two.</li>
            <li> Now when my hair gets a little dry during the week I just spray a little water mixed with conditioner and hydrate my hair when becomes dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li> I have long waving hair down to my waist.</li>
            <li> Now when my hair gets a little dry during the week I just spray a little water mixed with conditioner and hydrate my hair and flat twist it down</li>
            <li> Use it as a hair masque and it does wonders for my dry over processed lochs!!</li>
            <li> It is the only product I have found that makes it easier to brush my hair with less knots!</li>
            <li> You only need a little and it practically eliminates the need for other products.  </li>
            <li> I have very thin and dry hair, and usually when using other conditioners in the shower, my hair still feels dry while washing out, and never feels smooth when getting out of the shower.</li>
            <li> I have dry, curly, thin, color-tread hair that normally feels like hay before applying condition</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;m not certain that I&#x27;m allergic to it</li>
            <li> This product can be a little bit hard to dispense, but that&#x27;s a minor problem as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
            <li> My  hands are not strong enough to squeeze this bottle.</li>
            <li> The bottle is pretty small, so I try to use it sparingly when I wash every other day, but it lasts me about a month and a half with my hair just past shoulder length.</li>
            <li> and i have tried a lot of different products to tame them.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few other products including: Hydrating Argan Oil Hair Mask and Deep Conditioner By Arvazallia</li>
            <li> I always have to just to tame it, and obviously that causes hair loss too.</li>
            <li> I purchased this conditioner in the hopes that i would finally find a product that would tame my frizzy, bleached and dyed hair.</li>
            <li> And I only have to use a very little bit for the effect (and I have very long hair!).</li>
            <li> It works well on my dry hair...makes it very soft and adds a very delicate fragrance to it.</li>
            <li> my toddlers hair is finally not a frizzy mess!</li>
            <li> This &amp;#34;product&amp;#34; left my hair a tangled, knotted, fly-away, mess!</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the bottle is too small, especially for daily use.</li>
            <li> Less red scratchy skin, less dandruff and stronger hair.  </li>
            <li> This product has done wonders for my dry scalp and conditions my hair without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> It helps mending for my dry end hair without weighting down my hair.</li>
            <li> It rocks my long curly hair was a mess I looked homeless at times.</li>
            <li> leave my hair flat and heavy looking</li>
            <li> I stopped using regular shampoo for that very reason, so it&#x27;s very disturbing to try a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; shampoo and conditioner that causes the same issue.</li>
            <li> My hair is fluffy and silky instead of flat and greasy.  </li>
            <li> Would purchase again, and curious to try their other products.</li>
            <li> However, over the years between applying gel, hairspray, bleaching it, flat ironing it, curling it, I have managed to destroy my hair.</li>
            <li> I do not do well with moisture shampoos or conditioners as my hair will get heavy, flat and oily by the end of the day.  </li>
            <li> My hair was even harder to brush, as I have long thick blonde hair.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, long hair that has natural curl.</li>
            <li> My hair wasso dry that I hated even touching it!  </li>
            <li> I even started using this on my 6-year old daughter and she loves how it easily works through her hair and removes the painful knots!  </li>
            <li> I have tried my share of very high end conditioners that make my hair heavy and look greasy which is not a good look for anyone.</li>
            <li> the first one (it&#x27;s a few years old, sorry!) is an example of what happens to my hair when I attempt to blow dry it straight; this is partially for your amusement and partly to show just how annoying it is to try and get ready quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very long, slightly wavy, medium brown hair.  </li>
            <li> It made my slightly dry ends stiff as cardboard and dry like straw.</li>
            <li> I have naturally very thick, coarse hair and have trouble getting product completely gone!</li>
            <li> I also noticed that my ends are a lot less dry and not splitting.</li>
            <li> Previously when I visited the hairdresser for my 6 week color treatment they&#x27;d always comment on how dry my hair was even though I was using quality hair products.  </li>
            <li> My previous ones used to leave my hair dry.</li>
            <li> I have tried many conditioners that claim to be organic or natural and they always leave my hair nasty feeling dry</li>
            <li> I have thick, long, naturally blonde (</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly haor that is really thick and down to my shoulders</li>
            <li> and it keeps my thick hair soft without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> I find cleansing conditioners weigh my hair down after I use them several days, but I don&#x27;t want harsh chemicals and sulfates.  </li>
            <li> I have been looking for a natural conditioner without all the bad chemicals that actually makes my hair feels soft and this one does!</li>
            <li> A little bit of this goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little bit of this goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need to use handfuls of it - a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to say a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> Also, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Plus a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way</li>
            <li> And a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> And even though this conditioner does have the &amp;#34;little bit goes a long way&amp;#34; quality, I still worry that I&#x27;m going to have to buy these little bottles every once a month.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I felt my hair turned into a giant dread after using this product, and if anyone has long thick hair like I do, look for other options.</li>
            <li> for volume.. and still a lil dull (but not as with using sulfate, and silicone products) so added a lil coconut oil to my dry curls only ..</li>
            <li> I had been purchasing a competitors &amp;#34;cleansing conditioner&amp;#34; for over two years but was tired of paying the high prices for lack luster results.</li>
            <li> It only take a small amount (a little less than the size of a quarter) of shampoo and conditioner to lather up my entire head</li>
            <li> I have very hard water where I live</li>
            <li> I live in a city that has very hard water.  </li>
            <li> Even with the terrible water here, I can brush right through my hair without any ripping, so I don&#x27;t end up with a brush full of hair.</li>
            <li> My hair went from feeling very dry, due to a damaging protein treatment to silky and moisturized!</li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse, very long hair</li>
            <li> have thick, wavy hair, kinda dry and definitely frizzy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a few times and already notice that my hair is a lot less frizzy.</li>
            <li> If you have thick hair with dry ends, I would suggest following up with some hair serum or oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a young man with thick, coarse black hair past shoulder-length.</li>
            <li> It is a really thick product, a little hard to get just the right amount out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> Not good for my natural curls.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I can use any other conditioner ever again.</li>
            <li> * Leave it in while you shave or do other things to give your hair a chance to absorb.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I can afford other products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been bleaching my hair for so long that it was nearly dead.  </li>
            <li> I have never had this problem with any other application bottles.</li>
            <li> I will never use any other conditioner again.</li>
            <li> I use a small amount for big results.</li>
            <li> so I kept using it every other day which is how often I wash my hair.  </li>
            <li> This guy has been doing the trick the last few days!</li>
            <li> First let me start by telling you guys that I am completely obsessed with conditioners</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not one who usually reviews products - especially hair products</li>
            <li> I get pawed at by the other nursing home women when I visit mom</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other argan oil based conditioners, but are pricy and some did not work.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have dreaded frizz that I used to get with other products either.</li>
            <li> My hair used to get oily after 3 days with other products, but not this.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have to put any other product in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty expensive for such a small bottle.</li>
            <li> Other people like the smell of my hair when I use it, though.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First I will start off by saying that I only wash my hair 2-3 times a week, usually 2.</li>
            <li> This was an extremely unsuccessful endeavor, as the product provided no slip whatsoever.</li>
            <li> Just a little bit goes a long way!  </li>
            <li> All other conditioners have never performed as Silk18 does.</li>
            <li> I went to my doctor the other day</li>
            <li> like other conditioner</li>
            <li> My hair was damaged over a month time span due to over processing.</li>
            <li> My hair has always been extremely greasy.</li>
            <li> The vanilla scent is absolutely heavenly--strong but not cloying-- and still lingers in a faint way a few days later.</li>
            <li> My only qualm is that it is a small bottle for the price.</li>
            <li> that because this conditioner does things for my hair that other conditioners do not.</li>
            <li> I just wish it came in other scents other than vanilla.</li>
            <li> I want to try other products.</li>
            <li> I have to wash my hair once or twice every day because of sports and other outdoor activities.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking forward to trying other products by these guys.</li>
            <li> Due to reviews I found this product and used after using argan oil shampoo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not used to conditioning all of my hair, I would usually pull my hair back into a ponytail and condition the ends</li>
            <li> If it was more expensive I&#x27;m not sure if I would buy again, since the bottle is rather small.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to all who have damaged due to color or have frizzy hair...</li>
            <li> and i see a noticeable difference compared to other conditioner.</li>
            <li> Thank you for a product that delivers what it promises and know that I will try other products in your line.</li>
            <li> It is thicker than other conditioners i have tried.</li>
            <li> When I first used it, I figured it was just another fail.</li>
            <li> I was losing a lot of hair due to stress.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m checking out their other products as well, now that I see the quality of their product.</li>
            <li> Only a SMALL amount is needed</li>
            <li> Every other holistic product I have used ends up leaving my hair greasy eventually.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to use a deep conditioner once a week from now on and use whats worked for me in the past instead of wasting my money on things like this.</li>
            <li> My hair is behaving like hair, not straw, and it is extremely shiny.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled by infomercials for other brands...</li>
            <li> Well, I have absolutely minimal dandruff!</li>
            <li> Keep your eyes closed when rinsing, it stings!</li>
            <li> A lot of the shower filter advertisements descriptions say they will reduce Chlorine but do not mention the other two, If they removed them they would put that in their advertisement.</li>
            <li> After 1 wash I could see a difference that even other people noticed.  </li>
            <li> I find it leaves my hair rather greasy after a day while other conditioners have not.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to try the other products.</li>
            <li> a small amount was enough.</li>
            <li> Some vanilla and other herbal scentss.</li>
            <li> One was Wen, the other is Maple Holistics.</li>
            <li> Extreme itchiness from using this product.</li>
            <li> The only downfall when using it on small children is that I could not locate any &amp;#34;tear free&amp;#34; products in this brand.</li>
            <li> but it is a small bottle (only 8oz)</li>
            <li> My two daughters dont want to use any other conditioner, loves the smell</li>
            <li> In the past I have tried different shampoos and conditioners.</li>
            <li> and I can go a day between washes, which was never the case with other brands.  </li>
            <li> #34;What have you been doing differently these past 6 months?</li>
            <li> So I was extremely sceptical, but out of desperation, purchased anyway.</li>
            <li> I have extremely think and unruly hair.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to change to other conditioner now :P.</li>
            <li> I usually use deep hydrating conditioners.</li>
            <li> any other product I have tried</li>
            <li> I in fact wear vanilla extract as a perfume (due to a perfume allergy...</li>
            <li> I have tried other sulfate-free conditioners and they suck.</li>
            <li> Without using other synthetic ingrediants it makes my hair curlier and smoother.</li>
            <li> But man the fragrance is extremely over powering.</li>
            <li> The reason why i gave it 4 stars is because it&#x27;s pretty expensive for such a small amount</li>
            <li> This has never happened before with other products...</li>
            <li> I look forward to trying other shampoos and conditioners from Maple Holistics.</li>
            <li> A lot of other reviewer raved about doing this</li>
            <li> My other conditioners do not compare to this one at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> another reason (and probably why most people are even looking at this product) is because you are sick of detergents and other odd chemicals being put into hair products.  </li>
            <li> My poor hair has had to deal with hard water in the past and just hasn&#x27;t ever been strong since.</li>
            <li> and then I put it down and brush it, again with a wide tooth comb and let it air dry.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair that tends to get very dry, especially in the winter months.  </li>
            <li> May be a little expensive, but it is worth the cost.</li>
            <li> Sometimes when I see 1 star reviews with so much negativity I&#x27;m a little suspicious that maybe its a competitor writing false reviews</li>
            <li> I have very few conditioners that I buy a second time.</li>
            <li> Only a very few will filter out Monochloramines, some water companies use that instead Chlorine.</li>
            <li> My hair had split ends and was very rough with no shine at all,I decided to give this product a try I cant vouch for split ends</li>
            <li> and unfortunately it gets very tangly when it&#x27;s wet.  </li>
            <li> Naturally the coarseness and weird texture hasn&#x27;t gone away, but the conditioner does something to the overall feel and look of my hair.</li>
            <li> something I&#x27;ve found to be very difficult to achieve, because usually the more moisturizing a conditioner is,</li>
            <li> My wife says:    I have been switching all my products from \\&quot;regular\\&quot; ones to ones that are more natural and don&#x27;t contain all the nasty chemicals.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I can&#x27;t buy it by the gallon (though the 8oz size will last a while with how little is needed)!</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a very long way!</li>
            <li> This product as a leave-in conditioner also holds my curls very well, without making them stiff or tough.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m definitely returning this, waste of money which stinks because I was so looking forward to it coming in the mail at first.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick curly hair that tends to be dry</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, dry, frizzy hair</li>
            <li> I bought this product after trying several other conditioning products that hardly made a difference.</li>
            <li> I was having a very hard time managing my naturally curly hair and had been shampoo and conditioner shopping for something that would encourage my curls without making my hair look frizzy.  </li>
            <li> Moisturizes extremely well, but does not weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li> so I had researched a lot before zeroing down to this product and one other product.</li>
            <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t have that weighted down feeling that I would get with other products.  </li>
            <li> It also calms down any frizziness that happens due to the weather.</li>
            <li> While this conditioner is extremely nourishing, it never weighs down my hair.</li>
            <li> I will second the advice of other reviewers here to rinse with cold water!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, highly recommended product and seller.</li>
            <li> The only negative I have is that the bottle is fairly small, so I&#x27;m not sure how long it will last.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be such a dramatic difference, but I&#x27;m already starting to see a change in my hair.</li>
            <li> I have fine, thin, dirty blonde hair and get it highlighted so there is some damage.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hard on my hair every four weeks with an extensive coloring process.</li>
            <li> say, that only downside about this conditioner is that the bottle is a little bit small.</li>
            <li> I use along with Cantu Shea butter hair silk when my hair is in need of double help as curly hair can be hard to manage at times.  </li>
            <li> At first, I was a little skeptical; I&#x27;ve never heard of Maple Holistics before.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the lack of additional size options.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a sucker for conditioners my entire post-pubescent life when my hair changed to this monstrosity it is.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Silk18 does not feel like your average conditioner when you apply it.</li>
            <li> have long, naturally wavy, rather difficult hair.  </li>
            <li> I usually use coconut oil at the bottom of my long hair to help with the dryness...</li>
            <li> I had to start by using it as a leave-in due to corkscrewing, a mess I have been trying to resolve for months.</li>
            <li> The stuff is not worth the money.</li>
            <li> not worth the money.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s definitely negative reviews out there from people like me who would rather have their money back than endorse something that doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about spending this much money on a hair product, but after getting my hair colored and reading about all the harmful effects of non-organic products, I decided it was time to give this a try.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately I can not use it very often.</li>
            <li> This brings me to my final complaint:</li>
            <li> I really do like this conditioner, but goodness it&#x27;s expensive.</li>
            <li> The only negative for me is that I don&#x27;t like vanilla</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t mind this one so much because the vanilla does not smell like fake extract</li>
            <li> I only have one complaint...</li>
            <li> But I got a dark circle under eye cream.</li>
            <li> The only negative thing I noticed (</li>
            <li> I am not sure why some seem to have great results with this conditioner and others, like me, have terrible results.</li>
            <li> This conditioner smells so overpowering, like an old Victoria&#x27;s Secret Vanilla scent girls used to wear years ago.  </li>
            <li> I decided to try to do something about my thinning, thin hair - and the Argan Oil Shampoo along with the Silk 18 Natural Conditioner by Maple Holistics sounded hopeful, so I purchased both just two weeks ago.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried putting it up, even in a bun, but my fingers always find a way in there to the attempting to feel the texture of the individual, thick and splitter hairs.</li>
            <li> However, this conditioner moisturizes and makes my hair soft without leaving a residue behind.</li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse hair that is also curly.</li>
            <li> Normally, I would hate this in a body/hair product, and it was a bit overly sweet-smelling for me the first few times I used it, but I&#x27;ve also gotten used to the aroma</li>
            <li> I have thick coarse hair and this California heat and sun has damaged it a lot over the years.  </li>
            <li> I have medium, thick, a bit wavy, and coarse hair.  </li>
            <li> Unlike my other natural conditioner, after one use of this product I noticed dramatic differences in the texture and appearance of my hair.</li>
            <li> I have thin dry short wavy hair which is also partly gray.  </li>
            <li> If you want your hair silky and shiny without being weighed down this is the product.</li>
            <li> does not weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li> Perhaps this could be toned down a bit?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also turned the temperature of the water down in the shower as recommended, hair likes cooler water.</li>
            <li> In fact, tend to weigh my hair down a bit.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down.</li>
            <li> I never put conditioner on my roots, I start applying it about 4&amp;#34; away from my roots down to the end of my hair.</li>
            <li> Leaves it feeling silky, but not weighted down.  </li>
            <li> I have been looking for a conditioner that doesn&#x27;t weight down my hair or make it greasy.</li>
            <li> Was concerned that it would weigh my hair down, but it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> It did not weigh down my hair at all.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li> Price needs to come down for me to buy it again.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair look silky without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> this conditioner doesn&#x27;t weigh it down at all-</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down at all.  </li>
            <li> I have a lot of pain in my thumbs and even with it stored upside down</li>
            <li> This conditioner leaves my hair feeling so silky and manageable without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> It is hands down my go to conditioner.</li>
            <li> Conditions without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> It works well without weighing down my hair.  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair manageable, but not weighed down.  </li>
            <li> I have the bottle turned upside down in the shower shelf</li>
            <li> Does not leave my hair weighed down.</li>
            <li> When I take it down in the morning it looks like I took time to curl my hair.</li>
            <li> and it does not weigh my hair down.  </li>
            <li> It leave my hair silky but not weighted down or greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to try some of their other products to see if they also perform as well!</li>
            <li> Just need to leave the conditioner in the hair a little longer than other products.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m hooked for now and would like to try some of their other products too!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to try some of their other products!</li>
            <li> I tossed my other conditioner and am officially switching to this!</li>
            <li> it was so dry, just after a few days of use!  </li>
            <li> My hair does not feel dry or brittle, it does not leave my hair feeling oily, and there is a slight shine when it is fully dried (air dried).</li>
            <li> My hair is curly and usually on the dry side.</li>
            <li> As time has gone by, my hair is still soft, the flyaway broken hair is slightly (but not a lot) less flyaway, and my hair feels somewhat thicker and fuller at the roots as well as through the length of my hair.  </li>
            <li> I used this conditioner after using henna (usually leaves my hair a bit dry) and I have also used it after just shampoo, and my hair looks like a magazine ad in both instances.  </li>
            <li> I usually color my hair every 3-4weeks, and have dry, damaged, and frizzed hair.</li>
            <li> I usually wash my hair, towel dry, then put this in as a leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have wavy hair and usually my roots are oily and the ends are extremely dry.  </li>
            <li> I go through the bottle fairly quickly due to my long, thick hair.</li>
            <li> I find it very hard to squeeze the bottles, especially in the shower when my hands are wet.  </li>
            <li> I received it quick, thanks to Amazon Prime, but was a bit disappointed in the small bottle thinking &amp;#34;11 bucks for this?!&amp;#34; Until I used it that is.... I cannot stop smelling my hair!!!It is a subtle hint of vanilla that does not fade throughout the day.</li>
            <li> My issue with other conditioners has always been that when I&#x27;ve used them my hair has felt slimy and heavy - like the product was weighing down my hair.</li>
            <li> It made a world of difference, and my hair felt less damaged and not weighed down, either.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it&#x27;s not bad, but it&#x27;s not exceptional</li>
            <li> Every other product leaves my hair dried out and flaky (prone to falling out when combed) after an hour or two.</li>
            <li> I have extremely curly hair and always had trouble with it being frizzy.</li>
            <li> Other conditioners always make my hair feel heavy and oily.</li>
            <li> I know the bottles may seem small for the price, but this bottle has lasted me for 2 months--a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a decent conditioner for a while now as my preferred brand had been discontinued, and I had been let down by even the expensive &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Maple Holistics refunded my purchase 100%.I have a bad reaction to silicones: my skin gets small red welts, and I bought this because it&#x27;s been touted as silicone-free, and I didn&#x27;t see any ingredients that are in my list of silicones, but within 10 minutes of using this product, I got my classic silicone-related welts and had to strip my entire body and head with a harsh cleanser to remove it.</li>
            <li> However, it wasn&#x27;t that hard to get out the knots, just a few extra minutes.  </li>
            <li> It has a vanilla scent with a slight almond undertone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m half Hispanic</li>
            <li> and I typically have dry/frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> but I don’t see any flakes on my black tops.</li>
            <li> After using this I noticed less breakage after my shower.  </li>
            <li> It is not overbearing for me and after it is rinsed out it leaves a slight scent.</li>
            <li> and it made my curls smoother and less frizzy.</li>
            <li> My hair is softer and less frizzy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The slightly longer version -</li>
            <li> I was previously using a drug store conditioner and the Silk 18</li>
            <li> leaves my hair softer and less frizzy when it dries</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that as it rinses off my hair I have trouble fully rinsing it from my body</li>
            <li> and I feel like I need to use half the bottle to feel like my hair is conditioned.</li>
            <li> I find myself having less breakage.  </li>
            <li> I have two slight beefs with this product.</li>
            <li> It is not too much, only subtle hints all the way.</li>
            <li> I had it chemically straightened months ago and lost half my hair to it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a top quality conditioner that instantly revatilizes my curls, gives my hair an insane amount of moisture, softness and shine.</li>
            <li> After using this conditioner, my hair is shinier, less split ends</li>
            <li> and I just went through my cabinets and got rid of all the half used hair products that I had been saving.</li>
            <li> This conditioner has a slight vanilla smell.  </li>
            <li> I seem to have less &amp;#34;fallout&amp;#34; in the shower and my curly hair has been manageable.  </li>
            <li> I was previously going between Head &amp; Shoulders and Dove.</li>
            <li> I got a slight break out, but that was it.</li>
            <li> Ive had some serious health issues recently and between sickness and medications</li>
            <li> My next complaint is that my scalp gets itchy with dandruff within a few hours after washing my hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair feels softer with significantly less breakage after blow-drying and straightening.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also less frizzy and, therefore, shinier.</li>
            <li> So, without more gruesome details, I can definitely tell when it&#x27;s time for a haircut.</li>
            <li> My hair is bouncy shinier and less frizzy.</li>
            <li> As dandruff becomes an issue quickly if I do not use a conditioner.</li>
            <li> Not a super conditioning conditioner, but works well</li>
            <li> breaks a lot less too.</li>
            <li> I also think that my hair is less frizzy.</li>
            <li> My hair is softer and smoother, less frizzy.</li>
            <li> And I had tried four different brands of shampoo and conditioner before, but none of them worked out, neither cause serious hair loss or make it greasy and oily...</li>
            <li> (if I had to say) would be that I wish it came in a bulk size to make it less costly.</li>
            <li> My hair fall is less than half what it was 6 weeks ago.</li>
            <li> Also, I only need to use a very small amount of it for my thick and long hair.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is how stiff the plastic bottle is.</li>
            <li> as I let my hair air dry: my usually dry curly hair that frizzes if you look at it the wrong way was drying with tamed well-defined curls (as long as I didn&#x27;t touch or mess them up in any way</li>
            <li> I have tried almost every conditioner on the market, some of which are very expensive, to try to help manage my dry, very curly hair.</li>
            <li> For the past few years, my hair has been thinning (nothing drastic) and it has become dry and brittle towards the ends.  </li>
            <li> It is no longer a frazzled, frizzy, curly mess.</li>
            <li> your hair will not end up a sticky oily mess.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 28 years old and if you could see my collection of half-used bottles of conditioners, you&#x27;d be appalled at how much money I&#x27;ve wasted over the years trying to find the holy grail of conditioners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so will find out if both of these products work well in couple months, since damaged hair takes at least that long to repair.</li>
            <li> I have been experimenting with the amount of Silk-18 I need to achieve the results I&#x27;m looking for (since it&#x27;s pricier than conditioners I have purchased in the past) and have found that a quarter-size amount that is carefully combed from root to ends does the trick.  </li>
            <li> I never really strayed away from my usual &amp;#34;drugstore&amp;#34; brand conditioner until a friend gave me this for Christmas.</li>
            <li> I normally do not brush my hair, but started the past few months.</li>
            <li> If you have long and/or thick hair, this makes your hair greasy and fro&#x27;d out.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately I have long and thick hair</li>
            <li> I have really thick, long, and wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical that it wasn&#x27;t natural due to all the the ingredients sounding like they have chemicals.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair, long and thick.</li>
            <li> She also has thick, long curly hair.</li>
            <li> I have a thick black hair and its not easy to find natural product that does the job on the thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have noticed less frizz, and my hair is a little shinier than before.</li>
            <li> I have dermatitis issues and as a result, have trouble finding a conditioner that doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair and make it overly greasy.</li>
            <li> This does not weigh it down or leave it feeling greasy or heavy.  </li>
            <li> Product buid-up is the enemy since we hardly comb through our hair once it is dry.</li>
            <li> I recommended this product for anyone with dry dull hair.</li>
            <li> It is extremely hard to manage and is quite dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li> The shampoo takes a little getting used to for someone with thick, long hair.  </li>
            <li> I was highly skeptical that this conditioner would live up to its rave reviews.</li>
            <li> I have very long and thick hair</li>
            <li> Lately I&#x27;ve been bleaching my hair and it was dry and all frizzy.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ve got dry thick curly hair.</li>
            <li> my letting it air dry, and who has TIME for that with how thick our hair</li>
            <li> I have thick, dry, curly, frizzy hair</li>
            <li> I have thick, curly hair that tends to get dry</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s really not more expensive because it lasts much longer.  </li>
            <li> I have tried conditioner after conditioner to de-frizz my thick, dry, curly hair.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that this is a small bottle for the price.  </li>
            <li> In the past when I have bought a small bottle of conditioner in this price range, it has been concentrated and lasted a long time.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, another slight note: if you don&#x27;t like sweet-smelling products, it will take a few uses to get used to this product&#x27;s smell.</li>
            <li> I typically lather shampoo and let it sit for a few minutes while I shower</li>
            <li> and it made all the difference when it dried, less frizzy an shiny.</li>
            <li> but it felt heavy and had an odd smell to it.  </li>
            <li> Not quite as thick as I&#x27;d like it to be,  since I have dry curly hair, but it&#x27;s alright.</li>
            <li> As some other reviewers mentioned, I just need a very little amount to condition my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair feels lighter, not as weighed down, so the shorter,  broken hairs are still a bit flyaway, but not in the same frizzy sort of way they used to be.  </li>
            <li> It not only detangles my hair, but doesn&#x27;t leave any sort of greasy film behind that weighs my hair down.  </li>
            <li> I have long thick hair which is hard to comb when wet.</li>
            <li> I find that the static isn&#x27;t as bad either, which is a plus!</li>
            <li> I have learned that if you don&#x27;t have oily skin then you don&#x27;t need to wash your hair as often but instead run a little conditioner through, let it set then rinse.</li>
            <li> I was a little worried when I used the sage bc of the organic smell</li>
            <li> A little background about my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure whether it was due to the Silk 18 conditioner, the Argan Shampoo or a combination of both</li>
            <li> A little background-</li>
            <li> , a little goes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 50 yo woman who needs to preserve and take care of every little hair on my head.</li>
            <li> I do believe I even detected a little swing when I moved.</li>
            <li> And I have used a little on the ends as a leave in.</li>
            <li> I started using the product a little over a month ago.  </li>
            <li> Even the day after my hair looks hydrated but not greasy unlike other products I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> Leave a little in.</li>
            <li> and with a little gel to prevent frizz</li>
            <li> I thought this was a little pricey but after reading the reviews I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> I think it smells a little like almonds.</li>
            <li> I also put a little in a spray bottle with water and use it as a leave in.</li>
            <li> So a little background about my hair, my scalp decided to get flaky, greasy, sore, and itchy.</li>
            <li> Before going into details on the product I wanted to give a little history.  </li>
            <li> It made a little bit of difference.</li>
            <li> A very small amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> However, I do think the conditioner is a little pricy for the amount you get, but it does work so I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I wish the smell were a little stronger</li>
            <li> I was skeptical as usual, because I have tried a LOT of conditioners that have 5 star reviews, with no luck, and many of them made my hair worse!</li>
            <li> I have been using the product for a little over a month.</li>
            <li> I bought this with little expectations, just based on everyone else&#x27;s reviews.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work even a little bit ..</li>
            <li> Seems like my hair feels little softer.</li>
            <li> When I opened the bottle, a little got on my fingertips.  </li>
            <li> This product though has seriously helped my hair become healthier and  less dry.</li>
            <li> It is very hard for me to find natural hair products that would work on my thick and curly hair...</li>
            <li> A little heavy</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the conditioner is a little hard to get out of the bottle</li>
            <li> I found it very average.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally a very dark brown</li>
            <li> I have very thick, but very fragile hair.</li>
            <li> I will be trying other items!!</li>
            <li> I carefully searched for shampoo and conditioner to help my dull hair and the reviews made me think this was just the ticket.</li>
            <li> In recent years I&#x27;ve battled some tough dandruff and about two months ago I discovered Sage Shampoo for Heavy Dandruff.</li>
            <li> Plus, I&#x27;ve always had a hard time finding a product that works well with my thick, wavy, frizzy East Asian hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> I have very frizzy crazy curly hair.</li>
            <li> I think the reviews are probably artificially inflated considering that the brand isn&#x27;t really well known.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a variety of &amp;#34;eco and health friendly&amp;#34; products and been unhappy with the results (IE the product cost 3x as much as the Tres Semme</li>
            <li> few hints that may help (science or superstition</li>
            <li> I lather it all over my hair and leave it in for a few minutes and rinse with lukewarm water.  </li>
            <li> Not at all a heavy product.</li>
            <li> This was priced at something I can afford to use everyday if I run out.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks, I&#x27;m still liking this one.</li>
            <li> smells of heavy vanilla</li>
            <li> Not fantastic for my hair.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling heavy and over weighed.</li>
            <li> why use it, but I won&#x27;t waste it...</li>
            <li> I bought this product a few times</li>
            <li> I do not like to over wash my hair or use products that have harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> I rub it on my skin after the Dead Sea mask Maple Holistics sells, then rinse off.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for few time but already seen the improvements.</li>
            <li> , I then followed it with the Silk 18 Conditioner...left it in my hair for a few minutes and rinsed it out...</li>
            <li> Lots of shampoos and conditioners leave my scalp itchy after a few uses, but these have not done that.  </li>
            <li> and my hair has low porosity,.. and medium thin...</li>
            <li> so I just have to wait a few showers for my hair and scalp to get used to it..</li>
            <li> found Silk 18 a few months ago.  </li>
            <li> I feel like I moisturized my hair with out making it heavy or greasy-</li>
            <li> It is not too heavy.</li>
            <li> Made my hair feel heavy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not happy that they advertise &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;guaranteed&amp;#34; and can&#x27;t back up either.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few days now</li>
            <li> PLEASE don&#x27;t waste your valuable time and money buying this product.</li>
            <li> A few days after delivery I received an e-mail from a customer service representative asking if I had received the product,  and inquiring about my satisfaction.</li>
            <li> I wash my hair everyday which can make my hair a bit like straw.</li>
            <li> I can use this everyday and not have build up.</li>
            <li> All it did was turn my hair the color of copper and dried it out, big-time!&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I thought that this might actually be THE ONE, but alas, it was not meant to be.</li>
            <li> I use it in combination with Sage Shampoo for Heavy Dandruff from Maple Holistics.  </li>
            <li> but when I added the conditioner too, my hair wouldn&#x27;t hold the fluffy style I need.  </li>
            <li> I like to leave it on and wash my body/shave to let it soak into my hair for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Ojon stuff that dried out my hair</li>
            <li> I was tired of having hair that didn&#x27;t actually feel like hair.</li>
            <li> We both have dried hair.</li>
            <li> but it was honestly worse than regular grocery store conditioner.</li>
            <li> After a few months, I could not stand it any longer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too heavy</li>
            <li> Waste of money in my opinion.</li>
            <li> A few months ago I decided to go purple,</li>
            <li> My hair has gotten completely dried out from always changing the color</li>
            <li> This makes me feel like I need to wash my hair everyday, but I don&#x27;t want to because I feel like I lose a lot of hair each time I wash.  </li>
            <li> I dried my hair by squeezing moisture out with a towel.  </li>
            <li> Initially bought the Degreaser Shampoo but was not happy with it.  </li>
            <li> My daughter came over and said your hair is all dried out from using that degreaser of a shampoo you use.</li>
            <li> After a couple of weeks my hair was still dried out.  </li>
            <li> I went online and found a shower filter that removed the Chlorine and Chloramines and the heavy metals from my water and installed them onto my shower.</li>
            <li> I wanted to use it a few times before leaving a review here.</li>
            <li> It is a habit because I shower everyday.  </li>
            <li> I purchase this conditioner because I was looking for hair products without sulfates and harsh ingredients.</li>
            <li> I have heavily treated hair because of bleaching and dying over the years and this product makes my hair feel like I have never done that.</li>
            <li> I get compliments on it everyday.</li>
            <li> This conditioner was brought to my attention via the Amazon bestseller list and after juggling between a few choices I decided to go with it on chance.</li>
            <li> The conditioner itself is nice but the bottle is horrible.</li>
            <li> It must&#x27;ve been a combination of the salt and the harsh sun.</li>
            <li> Was skeptical to try the Silk 18 Natural Conditioner.</li>
            <li> It was too spicy (really heavy vanilla...).</li>
            <li> I bought their Sage shampoo for heavy dandruff and saw they had a conditioner</li>
            <li> because if I use itI everyday it makes my hair feel like straw</li>
            <li> I was worried that this may be too heavy for me</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t like the feeling after my hair dried.</li>
            <li> I gave it a few shots but happened every time..</li>
            <li> This conditioner has done miracles in the few weeks that I have been using it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s medium length - about two inches below my shoulders - and I heavy bangs.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> I could not afford to use it for everyday.</li>
            <li> I started using the Silk 18 conditioner a few days ago along with the Argan shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been losing hair for a few years now</li>
            <li> I have thin hair, and I recently went through a six month hair loss cycle.  </li>
            <li> This conditioner works very well on thin (not thinning, but thin) hair.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not a huge fan of vanilla.  </li>
            <li> My hair is usually frizzy but this product makes it silky without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> They usually feel so watered down that it does not truly condition hair one bit.</li>
            <li> It has a raw vanilla scent, not sweet.</li>
            <li> I let my hair air dry after using this product (per my usual routine) and I was a tad disappointed that my hair looked pretty frizzy.</li>
            <li> I have a lot less breakage too!</li>
            <li> I, I have notice they are less frizzy!</li>
            <li> Made my hair softer and less frizzy!</li>
            <li> I typically have to comb my hair in the shower to maximize he de tangling of conditioner, but not with this one!</li>
            <li> Half the bottle has to be used to feel a small difference.</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference in less than a week!</li>
            <li> but now I feel a bit heartbroken because I suspect their shampoo and conditioner were the culprits behind my flat, lifeless and greasy thinning hair.  </li>
            <li> so I was forced to use other styling products to boost volume.  </li>
            <li> After using it, my hair feels stiff.</li>
            <li> The bottle is also stiff</li>
            <li> I probably wouldn&#x27;t need such a dramatic conditioner because it wouldn&#x27;t be as damaged as it is</li>
            <li> And unfortunately, none of the products I had tried (and I&#x27;d tried so many, even to the very expensive ones)  </li>
            <li> I have used it  to tame my frizzes in between shampoos.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to tame ALL my frizz and flyaways</li>
            <li> This product helps tame the frizz</li>
            <li> It  was  not easy nowadays for me to find hair products that have no toxic ingredients in them and work quality  on hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this together with the Sage shampoo with the hope that I could tame some scalp itchiness and frizz.</li>
            <li> The reason for not giving a five star comment is that this bottle is a little bit too small</li>
            <li> I have long, VERY thick</li>
            <li> My hair is long, very thick, type 2a/2b curly hair.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m so eager for the future when this product is nourishing my hair instead of saving it from the brink of winter&#x27;s cold, dry vengeance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But as it&#x27;s impossible for human hands to compress this bottle, there is no possible chance the conditioner will ever make it through the tilt cap</li>
            <li> I prefer not to spend too much time and energy on my hair and hate having to blow dry and straighten.</li>
            <li> It is very hard to find products that don&#x27;t dry out my hair and cause it to frizz.</li>
            <li> The one complaint is that the bottle is such thick plastic that it can be hard to squeeze at times.</li>
            <li> Also, I find I just need to use a very small amount each time as compared with other products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Organix shampoo and conditioner for the past few years, but MH conditioner will be my go-to now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the shampoo I am using or the conditioner, but I have some trouble getting my hair to hold a style.  </li>
            <li> I usually leave it in for a few minutes and rinse it out at the end of my shower.</li>
            <li> just not sure if this can be my everyday conditioner at this price point</li>
            <li> I usually comb it in the shower while the conditioner is in it, and don&#x27;t comb or brush it after it&#x27;s dried.</li>
            <li> I have been on a quest to find a natural shampoo and conditioner and after testing several of them that left my hair in TERRIBLE condition, I stumbled across this brand.</li>
            <li> This makes it very difficult to find hair products that work for my whole head.</li>
            <li> Usually my hair starts smelling unfresh after a few hours.</li>
            <li> I order the 8 ounce bottle which was smaller than I realized and a little expensive which is why I chose 4 stars instead of 5 stars</li>
            <li> Also it added vibrancy &amp; lessened the dull tones my color treatments left behind.</li>
            <li> I was wary because not a single product has worked for me.</li>
            <li> i have thin and dry hair.</li>
            <li> Recommend product for dry, thin, color treated hair.</li>
            <li> I have always had extremely dry hair and now that its going gray, its even worse.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally dry course curly hair, plus it got damaged a couple months ago with a poor coloring choice.</li>
            <li> I would always have thin, dry, and frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick, naturally curly hair with a keratin treatment that has been destroyed by a bleach job gone terribly wrong.</li>
            <li> My thick, wavy, color treated hair was a mess.  </li>
            <li> I also have found that with my thickness, conditioner can be very expensive because I essentially have to use an entire handful in order to fully coat my thick hair.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical about all natural products, but Maple Holistcs proved me wrong with this conditioner and their Shampoo for Dry Hair.</li>
            <li> My scalp became red dry and scratchy and I developed terrible dandruff.  </li>
            <li> I cannot stand these type of products where u have to shake the bottle upside down to get the product out of the bottle!!</li>
            <li> I have very dry thin hair.</li>
            <li> Typically, after washing and conditioning, my hair feels stiff when wet and difficult to comb through.</li>
            <li> Tons of tangles,  No slip, my hair looked dull, lifeless &amp; limp with no shine,.</li>
            <li> and, for my thick-haired ladies, add a small amount to your palm and try to spread evenly.</li>
            <li> The only reason I give it four stars instead of five is that it is difficult to get out of the container.</li>
            <li> I received my shampoo yesterday and have used it twice in the past 24 hours.  </li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t take the time to write reviews, but I wanted to for this product</li>
            <li> This fixes it and without the harsh chemicals!</li>
            <li> No more tangles, no more ouches.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is unbelievable.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it didn&#x27;t and the only thing that seems to help is products that have tea tree in it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews, but I felt this one deserved it.</li>
            <li> I also have a sensitive scalp which itches like crazy after using just about any styling products.</li>
            <li> and I usually need an excessive amount of conditioner.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t like a thick heavy conditioner.</li>
            <li> Not sure that it even adds volume over what any conditioner claims to do.  </li>
            <li> My hair is softer after using Silk 18 for the past 30 days.</li>
            <li> After a few washes my hair felt thicker and softer!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get past the smell, I had to wash it out....</li>
            <li> Hopefully they will start making larger sizes so it doesn&#x27;t have to go so quickly &amp; it won&#x27;t be so expensive.</li>
            <li> The only thing I&#x27;m disappointed about is the fact that these don&#x27;t come in larger sized bottles.</li>
            <li> may update if im not satisfied with it..</li>
            <li> Usually, if I don&#x27;t put some sort of post-shower product in my hair, it will frizz.  </li>
            <li> I usually write reviews on Amazon, so I know what a 5 star product is.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how small the bottle was until I got it.</li>
            <li> I usually need a handful of conditioner to feel like my strands are thoroughly coated.</li>
            <li> The only way to get the conditioner out is to unscrew the useless tilt cap and shake, shake, shake.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve noticed I can now go 2/3 days without a wash and not have any issue whatsoever with excessive oil production.  </li>
            <li> Without itchy after applying small amount.</li>
            <li> No more yucky dandruff</li>
            <li> but I am not sure I would purchase it again though.  </li>
            <li> and it usually dries out my hair a lot.</li>
            <li> And it wasn&#x27;t as curly as it usually gets, which is also a miracle.</li>
            <li> product is in my locker at work, so I might use it is small amounts.  </li>
            <li> A small dot on my finger each morning</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t use a conditioner because it causes my hair oily, but Silk 18 doesn&#x27;t cause my hair oily.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m honestly pretty disappointed.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write a review but this time I decided to.</li>
            <li> And it was so noticeable because I usually wear my hair up in clips (instead of bands) and it would slip out.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li> i had purchase numerous expensive products and</li>
            <li> I know sometimes a hair product can go overboard on scent.</li>
            <li> And my usual frizzy hair is tamed after washing my hair with this.</li>
            <li> My hair never felt so dead!</li>
            <li> Silly me, I was only keeping it in my hair for like 20 seconds.</li>
            <li> No more looking, I found my conditioner.</li>
            <li> so i usually take 2 benadryl......</li>
            <li> A few facts up front: 1) I have naturally thick, oily, semi-curly hair, 2)</li>
            <li> No more paying $30 a bottle for conditioner that doesn&#x27;t make a difference.</li>
            <li> Waste of money!</li>
            <li> so it could just be weather-related, but I think the conditioner played a small part.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> i wanted something holistic, i&#x27;m not sure why.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually respond to these communications</li>
            <li> It is too expensive for such a small bottle and the ingredients and results are not something I would pay money for.</li>
            <li> The only reason I give this 4 stars is it is a bit expensive.</li>
            <li> I usually get my hair cut twice a year if I can</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nasty habit, and the more I pull, eventually some get pulled out, or pull others out in the tangling process.</li>
            <li> so I am anxious to try this conditioner for myself.  </li>
            <li> But the size is too small.</li>
            <li> One thing I didn&#x27;t like was the price tag for this small bottle.</li>
            <li> Love the conditioner ESP knowing it doesn&#x27;t have those horrible harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li> I was never able to wash my hair and go because it was too frizzy.  </li>
            <li> and I have noticed that my highlights do not seem to fade out as they did in the past.  </li>
            <li> This was a big fail.</li>
            <li> A small amount of the product goes a&lt;br</li>
            <li> Finally something that will repair my poor hair!</li>
            <li> She was quite anxious to get it and try it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been educating myself recently about all the nasty ingredients in beauty/health products, so I&#x27;ve been interested in switching to products without sulfates/parabens, etc.</li>
            <li> They are usually either too moisturizing, or they leave my hair so tangled I can&#x27;t comb through it.  </li>
            <li> After using Argan Oil Shampoo just one time, my hair has been softer to the touch, and no more waking up with wild and crazy hair in the mornings.  </li>
            <li> This product was a waste of my money!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this product at all :/</li>
            <li> My hair is not as knotty as it usually is out of the shower</li>
            <li> I have shorter hair that was starting to die by the wrong products I was and wasn&#x27;t using.</li>
            <li> But, I am not sure I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> Not sure.</li>
            <li> My usual hair routine</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a small bottle</li>
            <li> , I went back to the Amazon page to figure out what I was doing wrong.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the combo of these two</li>
            <li> the bottle is small, so I want to cherish every drop</li>
            <li> I have had big amounts of hair lose, and my hair is usually like so dry and bad looking after wash.</li>
            <li> With lack of humidity during winter months in New England, it&#x27;s normally very difficult to keep my hair in place, until now.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very expensive and it has the same level of performance as any other product from a grocery or drug store.</li>
            <li> And by that I mean I go through products like crazy, a new one all the time for basically every beauty routine.</li>
            <li> other products I tried just seemed to make the damage worse.</li>
            <li> I have thin short hair that has the worse scalp ever..</li>
            <li> I have gone through the baking soda and apple cider vinegar phase, but it didn&#x27;t work well enough for me so back to the chemical shampoo crap</li>
            <li> only complaint that I have is that it is difficult to brush my hair after dowel drying.</li>
            <li> Combine this with nasty, hard water and you can only imagine what a total disaster my long hair was in.</li>
            <li> HorrIble because it promises so much and falls flat.</li>
            <li> I have medium length thin to average hair, colored with henna.</li>
            <li> It comes out of the bottle thick, but dissolves into a slick, almost serum-like consistency when you rub it into the hair.  </li>
            <li> One minor critique would be the bottle itself, which is difficult to squeeze and control the amount of product released.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if hair ever gets used to a product and then loses effectiveness, but if it doesn&#x27;t, I will be using this conditioner for life.thing or conditioner as well).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if hair ever gets used to a product and then loses effectiveness, but if it doesn&#x27;t, I will be using this conditioner for life.</li>
            <li> my wife has thick hair that usually looks like she is a lion...</li>
            <li> Because my hair doesn&#x27;t feel as dirty or oily, a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> and/or scalp) and fine, snarly hair that is terrible to brush out</li>
            <li> I also have hard water.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really hard to find a product that works.</li>
            <li> The bottle was also hard to squeeze.</li>
            <li> it was dull and unattractive before I started using this product...</li>
            <li> My hair didn&#x27;t understand that and got dull and</li>
            <li> but my hair is hard on conditioner reviews.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also been using it on my daughter&#x27;s hair which was damaged by pool water, sun, and brushing too hard.  </li>
            <li> I hardly ever even used heat on my hair...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too hard.</li>
            <li> I use a separate protein conditioner and sometimes it makes my hair hard</li>
            <li> I color my hair and that makes my hair so dull and damaged.</li>
            <li> which is a hard balance to find.  </li>
            <li> It used to be frizzy and dull with my anti frizz chemical shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> would give it a five star if the bottle was not too hard to push.</li>
            <li> I have 3B curly hair, and it is hard to find the &amp;#34;right one&amp;#34; for me.</li>
            <li> I learned this the hard way.</li>
            <li> Her hair is always hard to brush through and always so knotty.</li>
            <li> The bottle is also hard to work with once you&#x27;re halfway through the bottle.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Small bottle.&lt;br /&gt;Very hard to squeeze the bottle.</li>
            <li> I have hard water in my house</li>
            <li> so I periodically use the Malibu hard water treatment.  </li>
            <li> I hardly return Amazon products bc</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find customer service like that.</li>
            <li> I hardly ever write reviews.</li>
            <li> I have very thin, course/dry hair and, after my hair air-dried, it was still course and somewhat dry</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this one if you&#x27;re trying to salvage your existing hair instead of just cutting it off!</li>
            <li> cold rinse is recommended as well as adding a little to your paddle brush to help with brushing out all the snarls without pulling or damaging the hair when wet.</li>
            <li> have had thick frizzy hair for years and it is so so hard to manage</li>
            <li> I gave 4 stars because the bottle is made with very hard material and not easy to release the conditioner.</li>
            <li> Initially I left it in for about an hour before rinsing with cold water as another reviewer had done.</li>
            <li> and I find myself having to use at least a 1/3 of the bottle every time I wash my hair.</li>
            <li> or they&#x27;re not operating on all cylinders because this conditioner sucks.</li>
            <li> but at least this one helps me to relieve stress from losing hair with brushing.</li>
            <li> I am in my late 60&#x27;s and</li>
            <li> but I was also being careful not to use alot because I think it is expensive.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel self conscious in public anymore or worry that someone will point out the nasty flakes  in my hair!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m over 50 and lately noticed my hair getting dryer and frizzier.</li>
            <li> so I have to treat it like a delicate science experiment and it did not react well to this luscious product.</li>
            <li> I usually use it as leave in conditioner and it surprisingly is not greasy.</li>
            <li> I am shocked that a natural product would work so well.</li>
            <li> It has to be the coconut oil, which is one of the common ingredients in all that I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently found that a brazilian blowout works well for making my hair look shiny and revitalized but am unhappy with the damage that comes with chemically treating my hair.</li>
            <li> and I was afraid it wasn&#x27;t going to be moisturizing enough as I rinsed my hair.</li>
            <li> I leave it on for at least 5 minutes before rinsing and my hair softens well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> With that being said, it feels hydrated but not oily (at least not for 3 days for me).</li>
            <li> I was afraid if having the same problem.</li>
            <li> So, I can&#x27;t complaint about the product.  </li>
            <li> I did tests using it with different shampoos, replaced it with another conditioner and then tried it again (just to see if I was crazy), but no.</li>
            <li> My chief complaint with my hair is that it tangles where it makes contact with my pillow.  </li>
            <li> I left it on for 5 minutes, then rinsed it out with cold water.  </li>
            <li> At least from how my hair felt.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for an all natural product that won&#x27;t gunk up your hair with all the nasty residue the big names do, this is the product for you.</li>
            <li> I put this in while I am in shower and let it sit for at least 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I bought it because I was curious what others were raving about and was afraid I was missing out.</li>
            <li> (I do NOT recommend that ladies or gents with thin hair use this as a leave-in because it may be too heavy for your hair.)</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and a lot of it.</li>
            <li> Before, I combed thru my hair slowly, petrified after seeing with each pass strands of frayed hair in the comb.</li>
            <li> I need something thick feeling</li>
            <li> I have thick, course,  frizzy/curly hair.</li>
            <li> Having thick and curly hair</li>

            <li> I have brown hair thick and somewhat course, caucasian hair, color treated with a lot of gray.  </li>
            <li> Plus it is wavy and thick.</li>
            <li> My hair is really thick, but thinning as I have this disorder Trichotillomania (a hair-puuling disorder).</li>
            <li> My hair is waist length and quite thick.</li>
            <li> It does, however, smell thick and putrid.  </li>
            <li> thick-</li>
            <li> It works well for my naturally thick hair and doesn&#x27;t leave the hair oily/greasy.</li>
            <li> It is thick and does help my hair feel softer.  </li>
            <li> My hair is thick, wirey, and wavy.  </li>
            <li> I have thick hair and sebaceous dermatitis.  </li>
            <li> I have thick hair and this helps me comb through it.</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t get a conditioner down that doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down, and I&#x27;m afraid</li>
            <li> But this week it has needed very little muss and fuss....which I adore!</li>
            <li> I have very thin, shoulder-length, naturally slightly-wavy hair that frizzes up if you look at it wrong.  </li>
            <li> No more wasteful spending!</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t already have this conditioner then you are Missing Out!!</li>
            <li> Look no further if your skeptical of its smoothing qualities!</li>
            <li> I mean *</li>
            <li> I want you to all be assured that when I say I have poofy hair, I actually mean POOFY HAIR.</li>
            <li> No more tangles!  </li>
            <li> The bottle is a little small, but its not that expensive for what you get and how it makes your hair feel.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve ever dyed your hair at home, you&#x27;ll know what I mean</li>
            <li> I mean I break about 3 combs a year,</li>
            <li> When I say every, I mean EVERY one.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of thin colored treated fried hair that has been so hard to brush in the past .</li>
            <li> This did only keep my hair greasy but it dried out my hair so bad i was having a hard time brushing my hair!</li>
            <li> I can use this product very sparingly, but it de-tangles my hair, conditions and protects it, without weighing it down or leaving a nasty buildup.</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t know, pig hair is very coarse and unpleasant).</li>
            <li> On a personal note, I have color treated my hair for years and have always used very expensive salon shampoos and conditioners.  </li>
            <li> I have used all sorts of very expensive salon brands and only the redken ginger &amp;#34;came close&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> At first, I was skeptical because usually things that tout that they&#x27;re &amp;#34;holistic&amp;#34; are crap.</li>
            <li> The only thing i did not like is that is very difficult to squeeze it out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> and i used a very small amount.</li>
            <li> Bottle is very small.</li>
            <li> And it is very small ..</li>
            <li> And I can&#x27;t give this product anything less!!!</li>
            <li> My hair was a real mess!</li>
            <li> I also like the subtly of the smell</li>
            <li> serious 10 stars.</li>
            <li> if you have a problem like mine, u seriously should try this stuff.  </li>
            <li> smell is too subtle for my taste.  </li>
            <li> I know everyone&#x27;s hair is different but this is possibly one of the worst conditioners I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Escaping the sun is next to impossible.</li>
            <li> Seriously my hair feels silky after I use this.</li>
            <li> I started using this conditioner about 6 months ago - Desperate to find something to help my dry, damaged, brittle, breaking, frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li> You also don&#x27;t have to leave it 20 mins which is ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> so I had serious doubts because of the lower price,i never buy at a drugstore</li>
            <li> I have thick, wavy hair that can be very hard to control and brush through.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so frustrating! - not worth my time!</li>
            <li> it is a little expensive for my non-existant beauty budget.</li>
            <li> Also, the bottle is poorly designed, making it hard to dispense the product.</li>
            <li> Not so bad , but will look for something cheaper next time...</li>
            <li> I bought this product because my hair needed a deep conditioning badly</li>
            <li> My hair especially reacts badly to silicones and proteins.</li>
            <li> It causes breakage and it&#x27;s not good for your hair.</li>
            <li> Sorry I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> I became so frustrated at my straw textured hair that I even used apple cider vinegar mixed with filtered water as a rinse.</li>
            <li> Summer humidity is not good to me but this conditioner does seem to be taming my frizzy hair without making it feel oily.</li>
            <li> Not good as the reviews said ..</li>
            <li> I do not have thick hair nor thin hair</li>
            <li> I decided to try and look for a protein based conditioner that was natural so that it wouldn&#x27;t weigh down my hair with nasty chemicals.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a bad history with fizzy and dry hair that it was really hard to manage and style.</li>
            <li> I was suffering from dry, frizzy hair and getting terrible knots in the back if I didn’t wash and condition every day.</li>
            <li> I know some people say that it smells like vanilla and other have complain that it stinks.  </li>
            <li> After a horrible time desperately bleaching an unintended color out of my hair, I was pretty upset to see my hair an acceptable color, but elastic, damaged and rough.</li>
            <li> NOT PLEASANT.</li>
            <li> I was afraid this would be too heavy when I read the raves by women with thick curly hair</li>
            <li> Hoped this would do the job for my dry damaged hair....very disappointed and hard to rinse out.</li>
            <li> my usual DHS conditioner (which is mediocre).  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel as guilty using my flat-iron everyday because this product supplies my hair with plenty of moisture!  </li>
            <li> Disappointed big time.</li>
            <li> When I put it on my hair after washing, my hair feels course and is very hard to comb out.  </li>
            <li> it is very hard for me to find a product that I can use and that I like.</li>
            <li> Very hard to get the product out.</li>
            <li> I consider myself a &amp;#34;hair care snob&amp;#34; and I have spent stupid amounts of money on hair products in the past, but not anymore.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s nearly impossible to get a comb through wet, it</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m just not very impressed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not silky and is tough to comb.</li>
            <li> We both have very thick hair that is prone to frizz.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick course hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair is very thick and frizzy.</li>
            <li> bit about my hair -- it is shoulder-length and very, very thick and wavy.  </li>
            <li> The conditioner itself is very thick compared to others I have tried.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick hair that is wavy</li>
            <li> Silk 18 is very thick.  </li>
            <li> Very thick consistency.</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair and this product is a must in my shower routine!!!!</li>
            <li> but the bottle is hard and makes it difficult to squeeze out conditioner.</li>
            <li> But alas, I found this conditioner</li>
            <li> I have really thin hair</li>
            <li> I have tired every dandruff shampoo.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is that I hate the smell.</li>
            <li> And after 2 months, my hair is not as thin anymore.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m hoping that it will help with the broken hair as time goes by.  </li>
            <li> I am totally addicted to this conditioner and have also been using the shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I have suffered with thin hair all my life (63 years).  </li>
            <li> Again not great but gets the job done.</li>
            <li> and then it can break and look thin and scraggly.</li>
            <li> used 3 times &amp; not happy at all.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awful, I really thought it would soften my hair because of all the rave reviews</li>
            <li> Its as thin as water and doesnt work at all.</li>
            <li> I was so upset and regretting what I had done to my hair because now it looked to be permanently broken.</li>
            <li> I am addicted to Camamu shampoo bars</li>
            <li> lot of people complained about its faint smell and its ineffective usage unlike the Silk 18 conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have very greasy disgusting hair.</li>
            <li> I wash my hair approximately every 4 days and NEVER use a brush.  </li>
            <li> This product made my hair even worse..</li>
            <li> For years I&#x27;ve had a chronic, dryness problem with my thin, blond hair.</li>
            <li> Some of the products I&#x27;ve gone through are Kevin Murphy, Pureology, and Kiehl&#x27;s, and to make matters worse</li>
            <li> Not great at detangling</li>
            <li> My hair is curly but thin and needs a lot of TLC.</li>
            <li> My hair shaft has always been thin, but I used to have a lot of it.</li>
            <li> I use a very small dab of this as touch up ( no rinse) when blow drying and my frizz disappears!  </li>
            <li> This winter has been brutal on my hair, it was dry frizzy, dull and itchy.</li>
            <li> So, YES, I agree with the other bad reviews.</li>
            <li> After this VERY harsh Northeast winter, my poor bleach-blonde hair felt so straw-like and terrible, so I started looking at deep conditioners.</li>
            <li> Even in my adult life, I have always had to rip my way through my hair, just to brush it out, with just two exceptions: (1) I can use a cider vinegar rinse (part of the no-&#x27;poo method), or (2) I can use Maple Holistics Silk 18 conditioner (yay!).  </li>
            <li> Its so absurdly thick and rigid that, even squeezing as hard as you can with two hands, it impossible to get the conditioner out.  </li>
            <li> I usually wake up with unhappy hair that is begging for hair wash.</li>
            <li> No better than anything I already bought at WalMart which is really disappointing</li>
            <li> I bought this conditioner and the Argan Oil Shampoo they offer and can see a dramatic difference in my hair from just using it for 3 days.</li>
            <li> The scent is very faint to me and not strong at all.</li>
            <li> Not good product!</li>
            <li> The bottle is very hard, making it difficult to get the product out.  </li>
            <li> I decided to keep trying a little while longer hoping my hair just needed to adjust, I didnt get bad overnight</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair that tends to frizz and be difficult to style.</li>
            <li> * Rinse in cold water (my hair becomes extra shiny when I rinse in cold water!)</li>
            <li> hair is usually soft and shine but using this product for couple of times made it look horrible and lifeless..</li>
            <li> As soon as it got a little longer it was all frizzy and dried out, looked terrible, I thought about going to get a hair cut and forget about the pony tail.  </li>
            <li> but I felt guilty , I was afraid of the chemical conditioner but, at least it&#x27;s organic and cause no damage</li>
            <li> I have very bad dry scalp and flakes</li>
            <li> it is hard and painful to get it out.</li>
            <li> This bad boy is thick, creamy, and luscious.</li>
            <li> This saved my life after using the shampoo from this same company (which was horrible).  </li>
            <li> (Sorry Wen!)&lt;br /&gt;Second, there is the quality.</li>
            <li> Now i&#x27;m obsessed.</li>
            <li> but kinda weird at times</li>
            <li> I color my hair a lot, and unfortunately it has been through a lot of abuse with bleach and heat styling.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive</li>
            <li> used the hair fall has decreased!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going back to using Shea Moisture which stopped all hair loss for me (until I tried this CRAP!</li>
            <li> , unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t help my hair at all.</li>
            <li> I look at my dad&#x27;s side of the family and see a history of unfortunate genetics in the form of baldness.</li>
            <li> Not impressed.</li>
            <li> downside - I broke out horribly with back acne after using this a couple times.</li>
            <li> My one critique is that the bottle I received it in was really difficult to get the product out.</li>
            <li> sadly, will not be one of them.</li>
            <li> I was not impressed when I used this conditioner.</li>
            <li> This plastic bottle is the WORSE!  </li>
            <li> Sadly, Silk 18 is not it.</li>
            <li> Sorry Maple -</li>
            <li> Seriously obsessed  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t go wrong with this brand and product.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the conditioner didn&#x27;t work as well as I thought it would.</li>
            <li> Some expensive chemically made products do work</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried expensive products like Living Proof that didn&#x27;t help at all!&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> It is also a somewhat expensive for the quantity in the bottle, but i guess one gets what pays for.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical about the claims and decided to give it a try atlast.</li>
            <li> I have curly frizzy hair, and it&#x27;s been increasingly difficult to manage the tangles after I wash my hair.  </li>
            <li> useless product.</li>
            <li> Just a faint hint of vanilla.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to find conditioner that doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;weigh down&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive.</li>
            <li> I have tried a million conditioners and all failed.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong</li>
            <li> a time, I stopped using shampoo, merely washing my hair with conditioner and water, or a co-wash and water, or a cleansing conditioner and water.</li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> I even tried some on my 4-year-old granddaughter&#x27;s thin, fly-away baby hair, and even she noticed!  </li>
            <li> I am obsessed about using natural/organic products because I am concerned about the environment as well as the health of my hair.</li>
            <li> You really can&#x27;t go wrong with this conditioner.</li>
            <li> So I never just randomly write reviews unless I&#x27;m going to be getting something in return for it.</li>
            <li> I knew it was getting bad, and my hair was getting worse and worse.</li>
            <li> but it was SO expensive</li>
            <li> I had been buying and worked 3x worse!).  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy in the the Expensive &amp;#34;Silk Hype&amp;#34; It Will Cost You.</li>
            <li> I have had an incredibly difficult time finding a conditioner that does not leave my hair frizzy.</li>
            <li> I am going to be really sad the</li>
            <li> so it has been difficult finding something that helps to ease frizz and keep my hair manageable.</li>
            <li> I am skeptical about buying before trying though.</li>
            <li> Needless to say</li>
            <li> The container does not allow you to squeeze the product out like it is suppose to, therefore making it to difficult to get any conditioner out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> Sorry to say, that this conditioner did not work for me.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s really expensive.</li>
            <li> Sorry.</li>
            <li> The vanilla scent wasn&#x27;t so overpowering and awful, it was  totally tolerable.  </li>
            <li> Not work buying and way too expensive.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I abuse it.  </li>
            <li> I know this is weird</li>
            <li> So, something is definitely wrong.</li>
            <li> The musky vanilla smell reminded me of that powdered deodorizer you sprinkle on your carpet before you vacuum, which to me is an awful smell!</li>
            <li> Now, it&#x27;s thin and thin:(.</li>
            <li> I also thought that a lot of the hair that was falling out while I was conditioning my hair in the shower was due to the fact that it was in very bad shape or a seasonal thing.</li>
            <li> I have a very thin ended hair, always tangled up.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife who has very thin hair that breaks eaily.</li>
            <li> I have a very thin and damaged hair.</li>
            <li> This stuff is SERIOUS!!  </li>
            <li> I have terrible issues with my dry and flaky scalp.  </li>
            <li> Seriously, you will NOT be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have very dry frizzy curly hair which is thinning at a terrible rate.</li>
            <li> but my thick strands became so thin it was outrageous.</li>
            <li> A little hair background, I&#x27;m an indian, 19/f, and my hair is something I wouldn&#x27;t wish on my worst enemy.</li>
            <li> and after about 3 minutes I rinsed with cold water.</li>
            <li> Then rinse with cold water in the sink after dressing.</li>
            <li> I had to remove color from my hair and was so afraid my hair would be ruined.  </li>
            <li> Then I rinsed the conditioner out with cold water.</li>
            <li> I had a friend who bought this and wasn&#x27;t crazy about it.</li>
            <li> I was also afraid my hair was going to be tangled.</li>
            <li> The really crazy part is that I didn&#x27;t have to use a ton of it to fully coat my hair</li>
            <li> And it stinks.  </li>
            <li> Then I rinse with cold water.</li>
            <li> I am a fan of all things truly &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; and can&#x27;t do artificial..</li>
            <li> I was a bit afraid that it may not work as well if I used just the recommended amount of conditioner for my hair</li>
            <li> My hair feels somewhat dirty even though I thoroughly rinsed my hair.</li>
            <li> Hair loss and nasty lingering smell make this totally a waste of money to me!</li>
            <li> Useless!</li>
            <li> It is frizzy, unruly (and possibly scary) hair that I feel will never be tamed :(</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical since I have never heard of this brand</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry to say, I was disappointed :(</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nearly impossible to use in the shower.</li>
            <li> I have frizzy, curly hair and currently a bad haircut.  </li>
            <li> (yes I know it&#x27;s bad</li>
            <li> (that&#x27;s bad)  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not giving a bad review because I think the quality is bad.</li>
            <li> It got so bad that I started experiencing hair loss.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a bad encounter with customer service.</li>
            <li> It really isn&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> I was shocked, not expecting that.  </li>
            <li> I was shocked.</li>
            <li> I was so frustrated.</li>
            <li> but I am generally disappointed.</li>
            <li> (so horrified :( )</li>
            <li> I could feel dryness up to 2 inches from the ends of my hair  :(  </li>
            <li> The hair serums I used caused my skin to breakout :(</li>
            <li> My hair is brittle and falling out like crazy!</li>
            <li> and my hair is insanely curly with a weird film on my scalp.</li>
            <li> :-(</li>
            <li> The product would always leave my hair greasy and I hate that feeling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m convinced the lingering of it would have made me hate it.</li>
            <li> I started using it myself and when I don&#x27;t use it my hair is frizzy and annoying.</li>
            <li> I absolutely hate having to detangle without.   </li>
            <li> If I brush it, it frizzes out and looks like crap.  </li>
            <li> I wanted so badly to like this product!</li>
            <li> I also wrote a review for the argon oil shampoo, and I hated that as well.</li>

            <li> Awful conditioner!  </li>
            <li> My hair is horrible.</li>
            <li> My biggest criticism would be that the bottle it comes in is really horrible to try and squeeze.  </li>
            <li> This is a horrible conditioner!</li>
            <li> The smell of this conditioner was one of the worst I have ever encountered.  </li>
            <li> terrible choice for strait blond hair.</li>
            <li> Horrible conditioner.</li>
            <li> I used this on my hair, and after leaving it in for about 10 minutes, rinsed, it felt horrible.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s corkscrew curly, it&#x27;s worst enemy is humidity, and it&#x27;s damaged.</li>
            <li> After showering, I use to just have a terrible day of flakes.</li>
            <li> It was disgusting and I was petrified thinking I&#x27;d have to chop it all off.</li>

            <li> I absolutely love Silk18.  I have hi-lighted hair and it has made it so soft and&lt;br /&gt;silky feeling.  The smell is incredible too!</li>
            <li> Great product and fast shipping</li>
            <li> I have to admit,  I didn&#x27;t read the product information close and was a bit surprised with the size of the bottle (small). However,  I really like this product. It smells good and makes my hair feel good. My 5 yodaughter has thick tangly long hair which needs good conditioner. This really has done amazing things for her hair both times I used it for her.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and results! Will buy again</li>
            <li> Love this. Better conditioner than any I&#x27;ve ever used not to mention much healthier!</li>
            <li> Great product! Leaves my hair feeling smooth and silky. Smells fantastic too!</li>
            <li> I have fine, thin, hair and this product has totally transformed it!! My hair has NEVER looked better! It is full, shiny, and healthy! I have spent many of wasted money on salon products only to find out that they make my hair greasy or dry. No more wasteful spending! This stuff is amazing and I wish I would have known about it YEARS ago!!!</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner! I have tried other conditioners and with these others, my hair feels brittle and coarse. I can&#x27;t even style my hair the same when i have used other conditioners. With this conditioner, my hair feels smooth and it is easy to style. Also, this conditioner smells amazing, which adds to its greatness. I don&#x27;t think I can use any other conditioner ever again. I am hooked!</li>
            <li> HorrIble because it promises so much and falls flat. This left my hair a mess: full of tangles, dry, frizzy. I will not purchase it again. I was fooled by all the positive ratings. Any inexpensive conditioner from the drug store is more effective than this one. I&#x27;m assuming they make their money from one time buyers that are duped like I was.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair really soft, not heavy and love the scent, a real mild vanilla...</li>
            <li> This conditioner not only smells great (a not over powering vanilla scent), but works like no other natural conditioner I have ever tried. My hair is shiny and smooth and healthy looking after just one use of this product. I have long hair and have been getting compliments on how healthy my hair looks after using this conditioner. I am going to continue to buy this conditioner and I am going to try all of their other products too since my results have been great. I have paid much more for other products with poor results, I am very happy to have discovered this companies hair products.</li>
            <li> Very good conditioner. Leaves hair soft &amp; tangle free,  but not heavy weighted like some products. It smells good too and most of all it is sulfate free. I have thin, fine, straight hair and most conditioners leave my hair flat and heavy looking, this is much better for me.</li>
            <li> This saved my life after using the shampoo from this same company (which was horrible).  The conditioner left my hair silky until the next wash.  I would probably get this again!</li>
            <li> dont like this conditioner made my dry like dry grass wont purchase again</li>
            <li> I purchased the argan shampoo, conditioner and Silk 18. I have no words! Not enough to discribe these products. I&#x27;ve had them for 3 days and am so filled with joy that I FINALLY found a product that doesn&#x27;t leave my hair tacky or hard to brush, love the smell and truthfully, my very favorite is Silk 18. I was scared to buy only because so many products are greasy. Oh my gosh, totally in love with it. I accidentally used to much and it didn&#x27;t affect my hair as other products would. My daughter calls me a &amp;#34;product whore&amp;#34; now it&#x27;s just for this product!! Thank you</li>
            <li> Great conditioner smells wonderful</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I have long, VERY thick (I clog the shower drain every time I shower because I shed so frequently), coarse hair normally. It&#x27;s unruly, it frizzes easily, and it&#x27;s a huge hassle if I don&#x27;t do something with it and let it dry au naturale. Allow me to walk you through why I believe you should give this product a chance:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First there is the smell. It has a vanilla scent with a slight almond undertone. It&#x27;s very fragrant and will dull out post-shower. The smell is not nauseating to me, and it&#x27;s hands down a better (and cheaper) product than Wen. (Sorry Wen!)&lt;br /&gt;Second, there is the quality. I don&#x27;t leave it in that very long (about 2 minutes while I shave) and after my hair is very soft. With Wen I had to use it twice and leave it in for an indeterminable amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;Third, there is it&#x27;s magical ability to be used as a leave-in conditioner (I do NOT recommend that ladies or gents with thin hair use this as a leave-in because it may be too heavy for your hair.) I use it as a leave-in and no frizz (I took a hint from Wen) even when it&#x27;s moist out. (Didn&#x27;t use it as a leave-in one time and it was a huge mistake!)&lt;br /&gt;Fourth, it does help my hair feel different--in a good way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few hints that may help (science or superstition, I don&#x27;t know but I think it helps.)&lt;br /&gt;* Leave it in while you shave or do other things to give your hair a chance to absorb.&lt;br /&gt;* Rinse in cold water (my hair becomes extra shiny when I rinse in cold water!) and, for my thick-haired ladies, add a small amount to your palm and try to spread evenly. (I find that the Wet Paddle Brush helps to spread evenly without pulling, stretching, and breaking wet hair.)&lt;br /&gt;* Post shower, do NOT towel dry your hair. It causes breakage and it&#x27;s not good for your hair. Instead, I recommend the MICROFIBER turbie twist. I love it because it keeps my hair in place, it isn&#x27;t bulky, it helps the hair absorb moisture while drying, and allows me to focus on the first thing that I work on in the mornings post shower....my facial regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feel free to ask some questions!

            <li> Very nice, natural products!  And the seller was also great to deal with; I will definitely purchase this again!</li>
            <li> I’m always searching and trying natural products (make-up, hair, vitamins, etc). I came across Maple Holistics products weeks ago and decided to try their Sage shampoo and Silk 18 conditioner.  Both products are excellent, my hair feels healthier than ever, it is shiny, clean, and smells wonderful.  The Sage shampoo does not cause build-up yet, it is very gentle. I have extremely fine hair and so I have to be careful what products I use.  I’m planning to stick with these two products. I’m a huge fan!&lt;br /&gt;I’m also very satisfied with the retailer Maple Holistics, they were extremely professional and speedy!  Ordering today again a new supply from them.</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner, sweet vanilla scent with some other herbs and stuff.  Leaves my hair perfect so soft, and real moisture.  I used it along with the Argan Oil Shampoo, but the shampoo leaves my hair at first clean but very tangled.  I definitely need the conditioner</li>
            <li> I love this product&lt;br /&gt;I have had thick frizzy hair for years and it is so so hard to manage&lt;br /&gt;This product is a god send from start to finish it is light, it smells beautiful a soft vanilla tone and it washes out so well. I straightened my hair and my hair looked so much softer and thinner than ever because there is no chemicals or sulfates in it</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner.  It smells awesome and makes my hair feel silky.</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner. I use it on my head and facial hair. Doesnt irritate my skin and keeps my hair and scalp hydrated.</li>
            <li> Fix my hair really nice.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is fantastic!!! Silk, indeed! The smell is heaven, reminds me of my vacation in Las Vegas, my hotel room smelled exactly like it and I love it! Hair is very smooth after using it. It amazed me how it felt watery applying it, but don&#x27;t let it fool you. It works!  Very light weight, doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down. Definitely will repurchase!</li>
            <li> This Maple Holistics product works really well and I like mixing and matching the different shampoos they offer with it in order to meet my specific needs.</li>
            <li> I use this conditioner in combination with a sulfate free shampoo. It leaves my hair soft, shiny, and manageable. I style my hair with a hot air brush and it looks better then it ever did before. I highly recommend this product. The only reason I give it four stars instead of five is that it is difficult to get out of the container.</li>
            <li> smells really good :)</li>
            <li> I just bought this conditioner, received it promptly and have used it twice already and am in love with it!  I have used it once with their tea tree oil shampoo (which is also great and smells wonderful) and by itself (since I don&#x27;t like to shampoo my hair too often).  I have hair that&#x27;s very dry and feels like straw, but after using this conditioner my hair has never felt so soft!  I lather it all over my hair and leave it in for a few minutes and rinse with lukewarm water.  And bonus points for it smelling like vanilla :)  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many conditioners in the past, but this one is the best that I&#x27;ve found by far!  I enjoy not having to use a lot of chemicals.  It has my hair soft and smooth, and leaves it pleasant smelling.  For the price, its worth every cent.  I have stocked up on it, as long as I can find it as cheap.</li>
            <li> Smells so good! Hair loves it! Wish price wasn&#x27;t so high so I can afford other products. Love products that are not harsh on my hair. In the long run it is better to get this item and try it.</li>
            <li> I Love this Product so much that I only use it when I want my hair to look its best! Because it does the job Amazingly well. This product has a wonderful and pleasing smell, it makes my hair very soft, and it also makes my hair shine to the max. My hair always feels very Healthy and I couldn&#x27;t be more happy to find this product. I came across it on my search to saving my damaged hair because I did&#x27;t want to shave it off. It definitely helped me take care of my hair. When I use this conditioner I get a lot of comments on my hair, people tell me that my hair looks healthy and I am asked frequenlty what products I use. I am always happy to share. If you don&#x27;t already have this conditioner then you are Missing Out!! I am so excited to try all the other hair products from this line!</li>
            <li> After bleaching my hair three times, my hair was very dry and felt like hay. Even after one conditioner use I noticed a significant difference. My hair was softer, smoother and felt amazing! This is the best conditioner I have used and I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love Silk 18 conditioner!!! I have hightlights in my hair ( very fine hair), and it gets a bit frizzy and dry after its highlighted. I was searching for a reall good conditioner that didn&#x27;t take the volume away and at the same time gave my hair the moisture it needs to feel healthy and bouncy and shiny. I searched for a natural conditioner and Silk 18 came up, I read the reviews and they were all positive so I decided to buy it, it&#x27;s a bit pricey but a little product goes a long way, I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase and will most probably will buy it again. My hair feels amazing, very shiney and bouncy and the highlights just pop! Awesome product!! ❤️</li>
            <li> I love the smell and I have only used it once but so far my hair is silky and soft. I was very skeptical since I have never heard of this brand but I am very excited to try different products from this line after my first experience. I hope to continue seeing progress in my current state of hair health as I am transitioning from relaxed hair to my natural hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been bleaching my hair for so long that it was nearly dead.  Ever since I started using this product my hair has life again and looks beautiful.  I love it and would absolutely recommend it for everyone</li>
            <li> First of all I&#x27;m a cosmetologist that has access to all the professional products and have tried many and always looking for new ones at the beauty supply. I ordered this on a whim because the company seemed very reputable and I know that not all professional products really work for ever hair type. I&#x27;m almost done with my first bottle and have to say my hair has improved 10 fold and I&#x27;ve actually ordered a bottle for my mom in AZ who struggles with heat and dryness. This is an exceptional product and I will recommend and also give it as gifts for the holidays. Thank you amazon-much appreciated for such a wonderful product. Lisa</li>
            <li> great product! Smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> Great product.  Made my hair smell good and my hair feels softer now.  I will continue to shop here in the near future.</li>
            <li> I love the smell, and it de-tangles beautifully. I have a lot of curly hair and some conditioners either don&#x27;t work to de-tangle or leave it greasy and weighted-down. I will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner! It has a sweet but mild vanilla scent and leaves my hair soft and smooth. Already used 2 bottles, will continue using this!</li>
            <li> Love the conditioner love the smell.</li>
            <li> I have thin short hair that has the worse scalp ever.. I have searched forever for the perfect conditioner that nourished my scalp and didn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy... And I finally found it. My hair feels amazing and is so easy to style.. No more dry scalp, soft beautiful hair!!!</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner ! My hair is so brittle after using hair color for so many years. Used store brought conditioner but never really gave me the softness like this conditioner gave me. I will definitely buy this product again.</li>
            <li> A little bit of this goes a long way.  The first time I used it, I used as much as a typical high-end conditioner would require.  Well, it did condition my hair but it also left it too oily.  The next time I used much less, mixed a bit with water, combed through, and had non-greasy results.  The smell is a bit strong but dissipates after about 6 hours.  For the price, it is a good, strong product.</li>
            <li> My  hands are not strong enough to squeeze this bottle. So i have to take the top off and shake it out. I have never had this problem with any other application bottles. its a hassle.</li>
            <li> Great conditioner! I put it on and leave it in. Helps with fly-away hair! Smells of vanilla! Nice</li>
            <li> I will never use any other conditioner again. The smell is wonderful and it leaves your hair so soft.  I love that it&#x27;s sulfate free and my hair is so full of shine.</li>
            <li> If you want your hair silky and shiny without being weighed down this is the product. I normally use salon brands only but figured I&#x27;d give this a try and I&#x27;m so glad I did. I&#x27;m half Hispanic so I&#x27;ve got dry thick curly hair. This made it moisturized.</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff. I have fine, thick, frizzy hair, and the frizz is so much better when I use this shampoo. SMELLS AMAZING.  Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I use a small amount for big results. This conditioner doesn&#x27;t hide any hair highlights. Inotherwords, it doesn&#x27;t turn my hair from blonde to brown like other products I&#x27;ve tried and does a good job of conditioning. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I have two daughters, one with super fine hair and one with super curly hair.  This conditioner gets them both smooth as silk!  I love the fact that it&#x27;s 100% natural and it smells wonderful.  I only wish it was sold in huge bottles!</li>
            <li> Excellent product! I have very dark brown hair that is bleached &amp; highlighted blonde. It is also naturally curly &amp; I straighten it once or twice a week. This conditioner made me hair extremely shiny &amp; soft!! I LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> Leaves your hair feeling silky soft and super easy to comb out after shampooing and conditioning.</li>
            <li> My hair is coarse and in humid weather gets frizzy. I like that this conditioner coats my hair and keeps it under control throughout the day. I like the vanilla scent. It feels like a spa treatment. This treatment reminds of conditioners I have purchased at the salon that cost twice as much.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair incredible silky smooth and smells wonderful (though subtle) - like creamy shea butter. I use much less conditioner (and products) overall than when I was using the bigger brand name products. Will be buying again!</li>
            <li> If you want your hair to smell like delicious baked goods all day, this is the stuff for you. It works well as a basic conditioner. My hair isn&#x27;t silky smooth, but it is tangle free and sufficiently moisturized. I use this along with the Maple Holistics Degrease shampoo, and it is a great combo for my needs.</li>
            <li> This stuff is very good quality and I love what it does for my naturally curly hair!  Will buy again in the future.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful conditioner, love it and it smells like pure vanilla!</li>
            <li> I received my shampoo yesterday and have used it twice in the past 24 hours.  So far very happy with my purchase - the product was packaged very well and no leakage in transport.  I have been coloring my hair for a few years just to cover the grey and only recently began to get highlights to offset my very dark natural hair color.  The highlights are damaging as is the color and damage is easily seen on my straight hair.  I do not usually blow dry my hair for everyday wear but let it dry naturally which sometimes looks a little disheveled -  and today after using this conditioner I still got several compliments on how healthy it looked!  I&#x27;m very excited to see what the future hold for my tresses with continued use!</li>
            <li> Recently started growing out my hair into a mini-fro for the first time. Every other product leaves my hair dried out and flaky (prone to falling out when combed) after an hour or two. Since I started using this just two weeks ago the hair is permanently softer and easier to comb/manage. Also smells quite nice.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product, smells good and leaves hair shiny and silky.</li>
            <li> This Product is amazing! Not at all a heavy product. My hair is thin and most conditioners leave my hair feeling heavy and greasy. This conditioner is light and leaves my hair not only smelling great but feeling soft as well. I have only been using it for a few days so far and I feel like my hair is stronger. A++++</li>
            <li> I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this conditioner!  A little bit goes a long way, and it works SO fast! Smells amazing, kind of like warm vanilla sugar.  Moisturizes extremely well, but does not weigh my hair down. I occasionally use a tiny bit as a leave-in as well, but is rarely needed. My hair is so soft, smooth, manageable, and shiny. My only complaint is that I can&#x27;t buy it by the gallon (though the 8oz size will last a while with how little is needed)!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I use it in both my hair and my beard. It has a really nice vanilla smell and is a nice companion product to use after their Argan Oil shampoo. I really like them both.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t take the time to write reviews, but I wanted to for this product bc I am so compelled by it.  My story is that I have been struggling to find a conditioner that didn&#x27;t make my hair fall out any more than it should.  Several years ago, I realized how damaging certain chemicals were to my hair and skin and thus I got rid of all my drug store bought items and switched to products that were more organic.  I immediately noticed a positive difference but it has always been the hair conditioner that has left me still searching for the right one.  I had tried so many brands but all of them regardless of how pure the ingredients were still made my hair fall out when it came time to condition it. Thus, I often skipped using a conditioner after washing my hair in the shower.   By no means am I having an issue with thinning hair, but still, I don&#x27;t feel comfortable seeing strands of hair all over my hands while I&#x27;m applying the conditioner or seeing a clump remaining in the drain after I&#x27;ve rinsed the conditioner off.  And unfortunately, none of the products I had tried (and I&#x27;d tried so many, even to the very expensive ones)  solved this problem until I found Silk 18 on Amazon.  I like to read reviews when I&#x27;m shopping and I am so glad I decided to try it.    When I tried Silk 18 conditioner for the first time, I kept my expectations low but the result I got was unbelievable!!  Not only did it make my hair feel soft and silky, but I was not shedding hair when I was applying it on my hair and after rinsing it off.  I noticed maybe 4-5 strands of hair total that fell out but the silky texture of the conditioner did not make me lose any more hair than I naturally would have.  My hair was left so soft and nice, yet, I was at ease using it.  I wondered maybe the first time was coincidental so I kept using it every other day which is how often I wash my hair.  And each time, my hair was left soft and silky without my worrying about excess hair falling out.   Thank goodness!!  Finally, I have found a hair conditioner that works wonderfully.  This is hands down an excellent product and the only hair conditioner I will ever use!!      Please don&#x27;t hesitate to try it for yourself.</li>
            <li> Great conditioner to help with dry flakes. Smells incredible, no harsh or toxic chemicals. Great product. If you are here looking for a way to get moisture back in your scalp or hair avoid all the anti-dandruff stuff that just hides it. This fixes it and without the harsh chemicals! Suggest pairing with the Maple Holistics Shampoo for Dry Hair and Flaking Scalp as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say enough about this product. Don&#x27;t hesitate just buy it and see for yourself. Did I mention how incredible it smells?</li>
            <li> This conditioner rocks! My hair has been damaged and dried out by chemical treatments to the extreme and just when I thought it wAs beyond repair I tried this stuff and my hair actually laid down instead of sticking straight up. It became soft and shiny. A miracle worker. Must buy more. Give it as gifts for christmas too!</li>
            <li> Super defined type 4 curls. My natural hair color looks darker and rich. Also made detangling a breeze.</li>
            <li> The best shampoo ever used, smells naturally great !!</li>
            <li> I was searching for a cheap nAtural conditioner to get my frizzy hair under control now that I live in Hawaii. This guy has been doing the trick the last few days! Initially I left it in for about an hour before rinsing with cold water as another reviewer had done. Just that first use alone has given a lot of healthy characteristics to my longer hairstyle. No complaints whatsoever! And it as a pleasant smell as well! Look no further if your skeptical of its smoothing qualities!</li>
            <li> excellent conditioner for dry hair. Very nice vanilla-y scent. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Silk 18 was the perfect solution for my very thick hair that loves to both frizz and dry out. I&#x27;ve been through a number of conditioners and I have only now found one that I feel good with. It does the job. My hair is moisturizer, smooth and so much healthier! I know that Silk 18 is a natural product with many great ingredients for hair treatment. I&#x27;m not a chemist. I can only say that I love the results. I also color my hair and it does not strip the color. Add that beautiful vanilla scent that it has... I&#x27;m not going anywhere else.</li>
            <li> I have dry thin caucasian hair, and the first time I used it, the difference was truly remarkable. After two months of use, it still keeps my hair silky and soft. My husband has thick caucasian hair that tangles, and this conditioner has helped keep his hair smooth and manageable. It is the only conditioner that he has used since I purchased this item. I will be buying this product again.</li>
            <li> Bought the Shampoo and although I could skip the conditioner between washes; this is also a good substitute if you don&#x27;t need to wash after a couple days but want your hair to look fresh. I have learned that if you don&#x27;t have oily skin then you don&#x27;t need to wash your hair as often but instead run a little conditioner through, let it set then rinse. Because this product is so natural and free of Sulfate you get shiny hair with just a simply condition. I will be purchasing this again and again</li>
            <li> I have been using the Silk 18 Conditioner along with the Argan Shampoo for 3 months. Honestly, I can say my hair has never felt better. I have been searching for the perfect Shampoo/Conditioner combo and I have finally found it! I have wavy/frizzy hair, and it controls the frizz while leaving my hair manageable. Oh and did I add it smells AMAZING!!!</li>
            <li> Best Conditioner ever!!</li>
            <li> So far, so good after using it for a day. I will update more about this product in the coming weeks</li>
            <li> Leaves my (silver)  hair silky soft!</li>
            <li> This product actually caused my hair to become more dry.</li>
            <li> I used this conditioner, and it doesn&#x27;t treat my hair.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this conditioner! At first I was a bit sceptic because my hair is so thick and dry but It smells great and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling weighted down after blow drying or a co-wash!</li>
            <li> Very nice conditioner. The smell was good, and as you rinsed your hair you felt it was softer. Great product.</li>
            <li> natural conditioner is making my hair softer I also noticed that it&#x27;s not falling as much not sure if it&#x27;s related. Great customer service smells wonderful</li>
            <li> Hands down my favorite conditioner. I have zero plans to ever try or use another for the remainder of my lifetime. The smell is TERRIFIC! I use after the Degrease shampoo day 1, then just rinse my hair the next day and follow with this conditioner. I have never been able to go a day without shampooing but my hair day 2 is better than day 1 and this conditioner helps rinse out product and leaves no residue. Love it, love it, love it!</li>
            <li> I just started using this conditioner. I have curly hair, so a good conditioner is vital! I look for products that are natural and don&#x27;t have harsh chemicals or toxicity. So far, I am pleased with this product. I look forward to continuing to use it.</li>
            <li> love the way it made my hair fell</li>
            <li> Love this stuff... It makes my hair feel fresh and clean.  It also leaves it super silly and I typically have dry/frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product about 6 months ago and did not have a chance to use it until now.  First let me start by telling you guys that I am completely obsessed with conditioners, that been said, I am never 100% satisfied by any of them, to the point that I combined different ones that I like to get that silky feel I crave.&lt;br /&gt;I have thick, wavy hair, kinda dry and definitely frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used this conditioner I used it alone since I wanted to get a sense of its mousturizing capabilities so after washing my hair with the sage shampoo of the same brand and after apllying it I distribute it evenly with a wide tooth comb and put it up with a hair clip while I carried on washing my face, etc and after about 3 minutes I rinsed with cold water. I could feel its silkness instantly.&lt;br /&gt;It has a sweet smell to it, kind of like vanilla or honey.&lt;br /&gt;I never blow dry my hair, I just put it up in a head wrap while I cook so it can soak up the water and then I put it down and brush it, again with a wide tooth comb and let it air dry.&lt;br /&gt;This left my hair incredibly soft and silky and most importantly without frizz. I am so happy with this purchased that I feel tempted to get rid of all my other conditioners because I feel like this is the only one I need.</li>
            <li> it is the first hair conditioner I brought in USA and am really impressed by its excellent effects. The first  is for its good smelling.I really like the almond scent and it maybe lasts 2 or more days.The second is that after applying it on my hair,quality of my hair is getting better, which i mean is silky and smooth. After all, I will buy it second and third time in short future after I finish the one I have just now.</li>
            <li> My first time trying this product I was pleasantly surprised. I have tried many different conditioners to tame my frizzy hair but I was never truly satisfied. After using this, my hair was so so smooth and shiny, and no frizz! I&#x27;ve had such wonderful experience with it, that I&#x27;ve been recommending it to friends and family. Absolutely love Silk 18!</li>
            <li> This conditioner first and foremost smells amazing. I often have issues with conditioners leaving my hair feeling weighed down, but as soon as I rinsed it out, my hair felt light soft. The vanilla smell initially seems like it might be a bit much, but once you wash it out, it leaves a nice, subtle fragrance.</li>
            <li> This product is great for thick hair. It&#x27;s also great to know it&#x27;s natural. Huge plus to me. Within 3 uses, my hair became so much smoother. I use it as a deep conditioner. I put it on, and let it sit for about 7 mins, and rinse well, and My hair is amazingly smoothe!</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner! It leaves your hair feeling very refreshed! Also, it have a very pleasant smell.I am completely natural and I only use natural products!</li>
            <li> Holy good smelling conditioner!! First things first, this stuff fantastic.. I was shocked, not expecting that.  If that weren&#x27;t enough it lives up to the name silk.  My hair was soft, silky, and shinny!  Whatever they use is something special!  Love it!</li>
            <li> I use this as a deep conditioning treatment. I have color treated hair and often have brittle hair. This conditioner leaves my hair smooth and soft without leaving a heavy residue.</li>
            <li> This is a great product . Leaves your hair nice and soft especially if you have long thick hair. Also leave it feeling healthy and strong. Love love this .</li>
            <li> This product is really good.I have a dry and coarse hair and as per my friends suggestions I started using this.its been almost 3 months I am using this conditioner and the difference is amazing.i would want to purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> When I think of my hair staying beautiful and long lasting results it matters to me. My hair has felt amazing each time I used it. Others around me has noticed.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  I have very long hair, and it is not always easy to take care of.  This made it feel so smooth!  I also have a thyroid condition, and I swear it makes it feel fuller.  The smell was WONDERFUL!  It makes my hair smell amazing even a day later.  It is a great price for this!</li>
            <li> This works well and smells good! It really keeps my hair soft and smooth. Even my ends of my hair are much softer!</li>
            <li> I tried Maple Holistics shampoo and conditioner as a gift from my son. He tried it and loved it and said I would too. I thought it was a bit expensive but after using Maple Holistics I&#x27;m a true fan. That&#x27;s all we use now and it&#x27;s worth every penny. 👍</li>
            <li> I have tried many many top line hair products and spent a fortune on them.  This conditioner is amazing.  I have naturally curly hair but get keratin every 4 months to reduce the curl and frizz.  Also have color in my hair.  When I went to my colorist this week she commented that my hair was in really good shape and I am not in need of a haircut!  I should be by now, but I think this product is the reason.  It is a miracle product. I love this conditioner so much I am now using on my kids and their hair has never been so soft and easy to brush.  No more tangles, no more ouches.  5 stars, easy.</li>
            <li> I have used SILK 18 for my natural hair.  I recently bleached my hair and didn&#x27;t like the feel of the dry brassy feeling.  Thankfully I received the silk 18 from my sister as a gift for Christmas and have been using it evey since, it is reviving my. Chemical treated hair.  I am very happy to say the silk 18 works, it help restore the moisture back to my brassy hair.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is absolutely my favorite natural conditioner.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  Have used it twice and it seems to work well on my overabundant, dry hair.  The product arrived rather timely.  No issues.  Would certainly recommend this product, though it is a little pricey...</li>
            <li> I ordered this product in November of 2014.&lt;br /&gt;My hair had disturbingly,suddenly become incredibly dry.&lt;br /&gt;I tried my favorite leave in conditioners (biosilk is one) to no avail.&lt;br /&gt;I attempted to go over a week at a time without shampooing it, and brushing, brushing, brushing.&lt;br /&gt;Nothing worked.&lt;br /&gt;I am 52 yrs old, female/newly postmenopausal - maybe this is an adjustment phase?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went online to research and started reading Amazon reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After treating my hair ONE time, my hair was silky and soft again and my ends are healthy after one trim about a month ago.&lt;br /&gt;I continue to use this and it is continues to amaze me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shampoo, rinse, apply and leave it in for 10 minutes, a couple of times a week. Then rinse with cold water in the sink after dressing. (I am always in a hurry.)</li>
            <li> I tried a sample of the product and was very happy with the results. It really made my hair stop falling out as much (which what other conditioners cause to my hair) and it made it really smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not one who usually reviews products - especially hair products but i&#x27;m going to review this one because it deserves to be known! Let me start by saying I have 3B/3C natural mixed race hair and my number one biggest problem is dryness. I, like many curly girls are product junkies and moisture is the key to keeping my hair happy, curly and looking great. My ends in the shower even feel dry, and I generally finger detangle my hair and spend too much time carefully picking apart fairy knots and using hand full after handfull of conditioner to get through my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product changed that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used miss jessie&#x27;s super slip sudsy shampoo to start. Then I put the Silk 18 in my hair. I started with a quarter amount and it covered my entire head! I instantly finger detangled my curls, rinsed and then re-applied a dime size amount into my hair. Now i&#x27;m obsessed. I&#x27;ve never instantly had, detangled, soft bouncy curls right out of the shower. Usually I have an entire process of drying, de-frizzing, twisting and adding leave in product and oil to have lasting results.  This product, has left my hair in the best possible condition after the first time using it.  I got out of the shower, and let it air dry and that was it. Ive even attached a photo of my curls to show you how great my hair looks 8 hours later. I&#x27;ve been getting compliments all day -  I love it and am so happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One minor thing you should know, this product smells like maple syrup &amp; vanilla. It will stay with you during the day. This is not usually a scent I go for because it smells sweet but it wasn&#x27;t offensive and i&#x27;ll definitely continue to use the product.</li>
            <li> I only buy organic or natural products for my skin and hair and I dabble in making my own at home. I loved this conditioner because you only need a little to detangle and smooth out your hair. I thought it was pricy for only 8oz. but since I only have to use a little, the price works out in the end. I love how silky and shiny it made my hair. I also loved the smell, very subtle vanilla scent. I also noticed that the smell was still in my hair even after a couple of days which surprised me. I am very happy with my purchase. I probably will only buy this conditioner when is on sale though.</li>
            <li> WOW. I just got my bottle Sage and the Silk Conditioner. I have only used each product once but WOW. AMAZING. I have shoulder length fine, wavy, oily hair. I dry shampoo every other day which has caused some dry flakiness to occur on my scalp all around my face and right a the top of my hair. This stuff is unbelievable. My hair made it all day without getting super greas-due to the sage I believe! It was so shiny and soft.-due to the silk conditioner I believe! I was a little worried when I used the sage bc of the organic smell but it honestly wasn&#x27;t too bad once my hair dried. I will be trying other items!!</li>
            <li> love it, smells great and hair so soft</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my teen son who hates leave in conditioner, mouse or gel but needs it to keep his curly hair tamed. He loved it and was surprised how it dried and looked like it has professional curls done.</li>
            <li> I gave this product a 5/5 because of the results I have obtained after four uses. Not only does it smell lovely, but I have genuinely noticed that my hair is softer, shinier, and easier to comb right out of the shower. Maple Holitics greatly appeals to me for their sulfate free formula and for the fact that they are a cruelty free company. A product worth telling your friends and family about.</li>
            <li> Purchased on Amazon.com, been using almost a week now. After first use the difference from the commercial conditioner I was using was dramatic. My hair feels light and healthy and super soft. I&#x27;ve been blessed with shoulder length classic curly hair; and only require the amount of this product less than the size of an almond.</li>
            <li> It rocks my long curly hair was a mess I looked homeless at times. Now it&#x27;s soft with tight curls that aren&#x27;t gressy . I get pawed at by the other nursing home women when I visit mom some cuss me for having nice hair it&#x27;s all in fun but kinda weird at times</li>
            <li> After trying various conditioners and serums in the market, I have finally found a conditioner that beats them all. Unlike various hair products, the Silk 18 is silicone free which is a huge thumbs up!! After the very first use it left my naturally wavy thick hair soft and supple. It instantly got rid of my dry tangled winter hair. Surprisingly the product did not leave my hair greasy or weighed down. The ingredients in the conditioner are very gentle and a small amount goes a long way. I highly recommend this product and would try out other products from Maple Holistics without any hesitation.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a natural product for dry hair, my hair feels less dry after just one use of this conditioner (combined with the Argan shampoo of the same brand).</li>
            <li> My hair feels more luxurious than it&#x27;s felt in years, and if it could, no doubt would be doing a happy dance for all the nutrients it&#x27;s now being fed with this conditioner. The smooth, soft texture is a delight to my fingers and the vanilla fragrance is a delicious added bonus. I have been looking for new all natural hair care for some time and this product is a total answer to my prayers!</li>
            <li> This conditioner is friggin Amazing! It was recommended by a close friend so I tried it and it left my hair so saturated and soft I had to get one for myself. I also use as a leave in and it smells Great!</li>
            <li> My hair is more shiny and full than ever.  I highly recommend this product.  It can be very challenging to find a natural product that is reasonable and works well.  This product exceeded my expectations and I will purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner. It has already shown a huge difference in my hair and I&#x27;ve only been using it for a little over a week. My hair feels stronger and looks smoother. Using it as a leave-in treatment does wonders over night. Just wish the bottle was a bit bigger so I don&#x27;t have to order as often.</li>
            <li> Amazing. I had to remove color from my hair and was so afraid my hair would be ruined.  I used this conditioner afterward and you would never know I just stripped my hair.  Will purchase again and again.</li>
            <li> This is a really great conditioner. It smells wonderful and it coats really well (i.e. a small amount easily covers my head [I&#x27;m a guy with 2.5&amp;#34; length hair]). That said, my scalp gets really itchy and I was hoping this would cure it. Unfortunately it didn&#x27;t and the only thing that seems to help is products that have tea tree in it. I&#x27;m looking forward to trying Maple Holistics Tea Tree version of this though and seeing if that will do the trick.</li>
            <li> I just received my order today and used it today . I love it . It made my hair soft and free of tangles ... I will definitely stay loyal to this conditioner . ;)</li>
            <li> I have been searching endlessly for an alcohol-free conditioner, safe for color and that will also help nourish my brittle and frizzy hair. I FINALLY found it! Silk 18 is great because it&#x27;s all natural and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling heavy and flat. The conditioner also smells so yummy, but not overpowering. My boyfriend approves of the smell, which is important :)</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe my brittle pad of hair can feel like feathers. I absolutely love this product. Please do not make any changes to the ingredients. I hope to continue to use this product for years to come.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is very light. When you take it out of the bottle it is almost weightless. I put it in my hair after shampooing and kept it in for about 3-5 minutes, as soon as i started rinsing off i already knew this would be great. Once dry, my hair felt great very soft and shiny, I even had an extra oomph of volume. And my hair feels clean, no residue, no slightly greasy feeling. Squeaky clean and very soft. I highly recommend this conditioner, but the only con I would mention is the smell. on the bottle it says &amp;#34;Complimented with soft natural vanilla undertones&amp;#34; I might not know what natural vanilla smells like because this smelled like a vanilla car freshener- like on of the trees you can hang in your car. NOT PLEASANT. I guess some people would like this kind of smell but it is definitely a turn off for me. It would be great if they created this conditioner with a variety of smells. For instance I love clean smells such as the combination of citrus and white pepper.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product! Thank you.</li>
            <li> I really like this conditioner. I have very thin and dry hair, and usually when using other conditioners in the shower, my hair still feels dry while washing out, and never feels smooth when getting out of the shower. This conditioner not only managed to do that, but it also smells so good! And, it&#x27;s all natural ingredients. I am really glad I tried this product.</li>
            <li> This is the first natural conditioner that de-tangles my (long) hair, without irritating my (very sensitive) scalp. Oh and it smells great! I use this on all of my little girls and we all love it! It took us a long time to find a natural product that worked! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Nice smell, great on the hair.</li>
            <li> Excellent conditioner. It leaves my curls moisturized, soft, and smelling like wonderful vanilla.  Will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> This is the best conditioner I have ever used! Me and my daughter both have naturally curly hair. Product buid-up is the enemy since we hardly comb through our hair once it is dry. This conditioner is awesome and we feel good about using it, it is excellent!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sold on this conditioner.  I had an itchy head from dry winter scalp before I started using this conditioner.  I also had extremely dry damaged hair.  After 2 weeks my hair is looking so much more healthy.  My head doesn&#x27;t itch.  I&#x27;m so grateful for this product.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by the results of trying this natural conditioner.  I have tried many other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; brands of shampoo and conditioner with unsatisfactory results.  I have very hard water where I live and it takes a toll on your hair by drying it out and changing the texture of your hair.  After using the Argan Shampoo and the Silk 18 Conditioner I could see an immediate difference in how my hair felt.  I have long hair color treated hair and it is now feeling silky again and has a very nice shine that recently someone commented about.  Will continue using these great products!</li>
            <li> I wanted so badly to like this product! I love the fact that it is all natural and it smells yummy! It just didn&#x27;t do it for my hair. I recently had my hair stripped of its color and needed a great conditioner but this just wasn&#x27;t it for me. Worth a shot with the money back guarantee.</li>
            <li> This the BEST natural conditioner that wife has used to date.  It has a light sent to it and is not overpowering.  Her hair does what it&#x27;s suppose to do as she says.  Overall it has been great!! She recommends the Shampoo as well!!!</li>
            <li> Maple Holistics is one of my new favorite companies!  This conditioner leaves my hair so soft, manageable and shiny!&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful product</li>
            <li> Great Product! I have been using this conditioner just over a week and I would recommend giving it a try. I can really see the difference in my hair and scalp. My hair is silky smooth and my scalp isn&#x27;t dry and flaky like it normally is this time of year. My only issue is that I am using more of the conditioner to fully work into my hair than I am of the shampoo. It really isn&#x27;t an issue but I think it&#x27;s worth mentioning. Overall, I feel that this is an excellent product worth trying.</li>
            <li> I just ordered this product for my scalp. I have been dealing with flaky dandruff dry scalp to top it off...For my work I always have to wear black!&lt;br /&gt;I just used this product for the second time since I received it and not only do I see a difference but I don’t see any flakes on my black tops. I am still in the trial period but I so far love it. I also really like the fact that they avoid using harsh chemicals and that the ingredients  are 100% natural.&lt;br /&gt;I am glad I found it. SO far best product for my dry scalp issues.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is amazing. I love how it smells like vanilla, how it&#x27;s all natural, sulfate-free, how it makes my hair easier to comb through. My hair used to be so dry from dyeing my hair all the time but it actually feels normal now! The only downside is the price, but with all the benefits it has, I&#x27;m willing to pay for it.</li>
            <li> I have recently purchased this conditioner for the first time and have seen an immediate change in the manageability of my hair!  I have very curly and coarse hair and nothing seems to keep the &amp;#34;big&amp;#34; out of it.  With this product I am liking my hair for the first time in a long time.  I&#x27;ll be purchasing again for sure!</li>
            <li> Great product.  For the price, this is probably the best conditioner out there.  I won&#x27;t be switching back to my old conditioner again!</li>
            <li> Smell was way too strong for me</li>
            <li> I really like all of the maple holistics products that I have purchased.  I am now using only organic or natural products and their products fit the bill.  The conditioner is very nice, smells great, and I have been using it faithfully since my first purchase.  The only reason I gave it a 4 is  because the packaging.  I find it very hard to squeeze the bottles, especially in the shower when my hands are wet.  If ity wasn&#x27;t for that I would give them a 5 all around.</li>
            <li> This conditioner has saved my hair from ending up in a pile on the salon floor.  I was so over trying to get my hair to behave that I made an appointment to have it cut into a very short pixie cut. But alas, I found this conditioner and OMG I love my hair again! It is no longer a frazzled, frizzy, curly mess. It is manageable, silky, soft and my curls are bouncy again. My only complaint is the lack of additional size options. I have waist-length-4b hair and I find myself having to use at least a 1/3 of the bottle every time I wash my hair. Other than that this conditioner is amazing. AMAZING!</li>
            <li> The product is super silky and smooth. I normally do not brush my hair, but started the past few months. My hair can be dry and have dreadlocks but this product helps with the tangle. My hair isn&#x27;t super long, but it tangles a lot. I&#x27;ve tried other argan oil based conditioners, but are pricy and some did not work. This was priced at something I can afford to use everyday if I run out. I enjoy the scent and would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I live in a very dry climate and I have been looking for a conditioner that would help my fine hair to be moisturized but not too greasy. This is it! I also like the subtly of the smell, it&#x27;s natural and not overpowering like so many products on the market.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised that this conditioner worked so well on my super tangled hair. The smell is so nice, but not overwhelming. It doesn&#x27;t completely fight my frizz, but I still love it.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly/wavy hair and this conditioner is one of the best that I have used.  Leaves my hair very hydrated helping keep the frizz calm.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this conditioner.  I bought this to use along with the Maple Holistics Argan shampoo.  Fabulous combination.  I am dealing with hormonal changes after having a baby and the condition of my hair is suffering.  I was looking for a more natural product to use when I stumbled upon Maple Holistics products.  This conditioner leaves my hair feeling silky (see what I did there?) and smooth, without being weighed down.  It also smells very nice and I can still smell a bit of the scent hours after shampooing - with most other shampoos/conditioners, my hair just smells like hair.  I highly recommend this conditioner and the Argan shampoo.  I have ordered the Argan conditioner as well and can&#x27;t wait to receive it and try it out!</li>
            <li> This is an awesome conditioner, made my hair silky and smooth. Not only did it untangle my hair but my hair was so soft for days. Highly recommend this conditioner. Looking forward to trying their other natural products.Loved the conditioner.</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic. I have thick, long, naturally blonde (though it&#x27;s been graying since I was 17 - now 34) hair.  My hair has a natural wave to it in the back and underneath and is straight in the front and on top. Because of the different textures it tangles very easily and frizzes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried A LOT of different conditioners over the years. I&#x27;m very picky about my conditioner. It has to leave my hair smooth feeling with a decent detangling and even better if it can help keep frizz at bay and/or help with the texture of my hair.  This one does it all. AND I can use FAR less of it than with other conditioners.  I was shocked. I thought the tiny bottle would only last me a week (and I only wash my hair ever 2-3 days) but it lasted me over a month.  It&#x27;s so great though I kind of want a giant bottle of it just so it&#x27;ll last me a bit longer.</li>
            <li> I was super skeptical as everything &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; seems to dry out and damage my hair even further. I used this with the argan shampoo from the same company. My hair feels amazing ! It&#x27;s not dry and frizzy it feels like I just went to get my hair done smooth.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I used this condtioner and I already feel the difference.  My hair become soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> No other conditioner has tangles my hair the way this product does. I will not be reordering. Two starts for natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> My 26 year old daughter researched and found this conditioner, raved about it for days, so I had to try it.  I bought it and am very impressed with how silky rich it feels, and my tendency toward oily hair is not exacerbated which is always my fear with conditioners.  I also love that it is sulfate free!  I highly recommend giving it a try.</li>
            <li> i purchased this product based on the reviews and it really does what it claims. I&#x27;m already recommending it to my co-workers.</li>
            <li> I love it !!! I used this conditioner for the past 2 weeks and my hair is consistently soft shiny and beautiful. I have received so many compliments. I have medium curls and fairly coarse textured dark hair with highlights. This winter has been brutal on my hair, it was dry frizzy, dull and itchy. Just one use of this miraculous conditioner made it like salon perfect! Also I bought the Sage shampoo for dandruff issues that basically disappeared after using it for 1 week. I have probably spend thousands of dollars in my lifetime trying to find the perfect fit of hair product for my hair and I think I found it!! Also the fragrance of this conditioner is so pleasant and natural unlike the fake intense floral hair product out there.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this conditioner, along with the argon oil shampoo for one of my guest bathrooms. But, since we don&#x27;t have any guests at the moment, I decided to give it a try. Really liked it, as it left my curly, thick hair super soft plus no frizz in the south Carolina&#x27;s humid late spring this year. I noticed the shampoo and conditioner leaves no residue as my hair looks good even the next morning,. I usually wake up with unhappy hair that is begging for hair wash.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is great! It&#x27;s natural vanilla scent is amazing &amp; not over powering to my nose, plus, it helps to cover the (offputting) scent of my shampoo. It does not seem to moisturize as well as I expected, but my hair isn&#x27;t dry, so I suppose it&#x27;s more that this conditioner isn&#x27;t ridiculously rich &amp; thick like store brand conditioners. Doesn&#x27;t detangle like I&#x27;d prefer, but not at all a deal breaker.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe this is actually sulfate free. I paid $ 400.00 for a keratin treatment and after switching from the real sulfate free shampoo to this one, my hair immediately changed.</li>
            <li> Best thing that happened to my hair. I love how silky this conditioner is. And it has a subtle vanilla sent which I prefer over the strong smelling hair products.</li>
            <li> Living in the heat of the South, we probably wash and dry our hair more than most. I also have hard water. I need a conditioner that can tackle these elements, and after several uses, Maple Holistics Silk 18 has impressed me. I have hair just below the shoulders and only need a nickel-size amount. I leave it in while I wash to really let it soak into my ends. After drying, my hair still retains a softness and shine. The smell is yummy too. I&#x27;ll be purchasing the shampoo, too. My only wish is that it came in a larger bottle!</li>
            <li> Excellent product.. I&#x27;ll but it again :)</li>
            <li> Really good conditioner. Left my hair feeling really soft.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best conditioners I have used in my natural hair journey. I have been natural for about 4 years and my natural 4a/4b hair loves this product as a leave-in conditioner! It made my hair extremely soft and supple as I styled for the following day. My hair went from feeling very dry, due to a damaging protein treatment to silky and moisturized! I was worried that it would make my hair too mushy and that it wouldn&#x27;t hold the curls I was attempting to form, but it formed bouncy and soft yet defined curls as if I used a gel. My hair is currently very silky because of my use of Silk18 conditioner, and I would definitely recommend it to others. I used this product after I had a damaging protein treatment, even upon washing out the Silk18 my hair feels balanced and even better than before!</li>
            <li> This conditioner is really nice- or smells good, leaves my hair soft and shiny - I most definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews, but I felt this one deserved it. This conditioner is amazing. It pairs nicely with the sage shampoo and smells so good. The vanilla isn&#x27;t overpowering at all. It makes my hair nice and silky. I don&#x27;t have dreaded frizz that I used to get with other products either. My hair used to get oily after 3 days with other products, but not this. I wash my hair because I feel it necessary, but it still looks just as good on day 3 as it does on day 1! No oil!</li>
            <li> Has a very nice vanilla scent but it didn&#x27;t do much for my hair.  My hair breaks and splits easy.  It&#x27;s wavy/curly and coarse.</li>
            <li> Very Good Shampoo and Conditioner Made My Hair Very Soft and Smooth!(:💝 would like a Free Product for My 5 Star Review!(:💝</li>
            <li> Nice for collor hair thanks</li>
            <li> Great product. My hair is usually frizzy but this product makes it silky without weighing it down. A little goes a long way. It smells good too.</li>
            <li> A little background about my hair. I used to have pencil straight, fine hair. However, my hair changed once I had my second child five years ago. It became wavy and frizzy! Everything, and I mean *everything* I tried didn&#x27;t help with the frizz. I bought this Silk 18 conditioner and it takes away almost all of the frizz. YEAH! I like the way this product smells, a small amount goes a long way and my hair turns out soft. I am so happy with Silk 18. I also use shampoo from Maple Holistics.</li>
            <li> Awesome! My fussy hair goes super smooth after only one time using the product. However, I&#x27;m not a fan of the very strong warm vanilla smell after that ... therefore 4 starts.</li>
            <li> Finished using the product I purchased wanted to wait to make a review after finishing use of product for a more truthful experience.  The conditioner did not work well with my hair.  I have thick, wavy, long hair and noticed after use my hair felt drier and more frizzier, not soft like with other over the counter conditioners I have used; will definitely not buy again.</li>
            <li> Smells better than other natural conditioners.</li>
            <li> This product has done wonders for my dry hair. No frizzy or rough hair after my shampoo and condition. I didn&#x27;t even need to blow dry or flat iron after washing (which is pretty much always necessary for a smooth style on my hair). Conditioner smells great, and I do not need to use much per wash. Will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Smells great and works great on my hair! The bottle is a bit hard to squeeze, and there are no real directions on the bottle, but then again conditioner is pretty self explanatory. I&#x27;ve let it sit in my hair for a bit and then washed off. Definitely the best bang for the buck out there.</li>
            <li> This is a very high quality hair product!  It makes your hair silky smooth and feeling healthy.  Customer&#x27;s service at Maple Holistics is superb.  I will order more products from this company.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a reason the reviews for this product are through the roof. Affordable, effective, and organic...can&#x27;t really get much better than that.&lt;br /&gt;Leave it in for a couple of minutes and you&#x27;ll be floored by the results. Cannot recommend highly enough!</li>
            <li> Needed a good, natural conditioner for my color-treated hair. After a few weeks, I&#x27;m still liking this one.</li>
            <li> This natural conditioner was recommended by my good friend working in a health department. I read the ingredients in the conditioner, and purchased it. I love all natural product and am very happy with this product! I have very fine long hair, prone to frizz and dryness - this conditioner works wonders. I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more and recommending this conditioner to my family and friends.</li>
            <li> Got this conditioner with the winter shampoo. Used it for the first time and never experience itchiness or any allergic reaction, I have seborrheic dermatitis/psoriasis and I always experience itchiness after a few hours of using different shampoo/conditioner that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m always in search of shampoo/ conditioner. The reason I gave this a 4 star is because I&#x27;m still in the &amp;#34;observation&amp;#34; phase if this will work for my very sensitive scalp (hoping it will).</li>
            <li> My daughter has dry scalp.  We received this last week and we already see a significant improvement in her dandruff.  I</li>
            <li> This is the absolute best conditioner I have ever used! I am an older woman and color my hair which has always been fine, but thick and now thinning on top. An inherited problem. I also have a sensitive scalp which itches like crazy after using just about any styling products. Silk 18 leaves my curly wavy hair looking much thicker on top and shiny all over. No flyaways, no additional products needed. No itching! With lack of humidity during winter months in New England, it&#x27;s normally very difficult to keep my hair in place, until now. I am a most satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> Love love love this conditioner!!!  I have blonde hair and when I get my roots touched up, we use bleach which I&#x27;m sure you all know how damaging that can be.  I have been using this conditioner for a few years now and it is absolutely amazing.  Before using this product my hair use to be frizzy with split ends and it would break easily.  My hair is no longer frizzy, it&#x27;s much stronger and does not break off anymore.  I also use it as a leave in conditioner.  I just take a small spray bottle and put half of the silk 18 and the other half water, shake it up real good.....now you&#x27;ve got yourself the perfect leave in conditioner!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff. I was trying carols daughter and several other products with hopes that one would suffice. The product would always leave my hair greasy and I hate that feeling. It makes me feel like I have to wash my hair constinstanly. This conditioner is wonderful it doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel like it&#x27;s greasy. I have used it for about a little over a week my hair is very soft and not weighed down. You now have a new loyal costumer ☺️5 Stars</li>
            <li> I hestitate to spend a lot of money on conditioner, but I bought this one after I did my keratin treatment at salon. I&#x27;m in love with this product, the vanilla smell was great and leave a soft touch on the hair. No regrets to invest on this product.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is the richest most luxurious product I&#x27;ve ever used to wash my hair. The shampoo feels conditioning in itself but I also bought the conditioner which was magical. My hair was so soft and manageable after using it I didn&#x27;t have to put any other product in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this combination and will repurchase again and again! Thank you for creating such wonderful products!</li>
            <li> This conditioner, I found, made my 3b curly hair,easier to comb through. The end result was soft and a little more manageable. It didn&#x27;t define my curls as much as I would have liked. It may work better for other people, but overall I give it four stars.</li>
            <li> I color my hair about every six weeks, and being blonde is super tough on the hair!!  I needed a leave-in conditioner because my hair was breaking off because it was so incredibly DRY!  After just one use, I noticed that the hair shaft was noticeably smoother...I could actually get a comb through my hair without losing about 100 strands of hair!  It is very concentrated, so it&#x27;s what I needed, and I like I don&#x27;t have to rinse it out.  I am also very sensitive to products that weigh my hair down and this product doesn&#x27;t seem to do that at all!  It&#x27;s wonderful!!</li>
            <li> This just arrived today so I&#x27;ve not used it yet and I&amp;#34;m sure it&#x27;s very good conditioner. However, no description was given of the smell and I like shampoos and conditioners that smell fresh and clean and bright. Nothing that smells like suntan lotion or food (unless it&#x27;s lemon or grapefruit).&lt;br /&gt;This smells of heavy vanilla so I do not like it.</li>
            <li> I bought this because of the good reviews so I was surprised by the results.  I thought it would make my hair soft and silky and help detangle after washing, but it did just the opposite.  When I put it on my hair after washing, my hair feels course and is very hard to comb out.  Sorry I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> Not fantastic for my hair. I love the smell - wonderful but not overpowering. But my hair is way too oily now. It worked great when my curly hair was ultra-short and I wanted a heavier finish, but now that it&#x27;s a bit longer not so much.</li>
            <li> I sent an e mail to Maple Holistics and recievied a sample of this conditioner.  It is best used with a bar of  Dr. Bronners lavender soap  as a shampoo!  The conditioner has a light scent and leaves hair soft!</li>
            <li> Size is a little smaller than I was expecting for the price, but the product is wonderful. I love the smell and it leaves my hair smooth.</li>
            <li> Tried it right away since my hair was so dry. Has a nice smell and really help my hair. Since my hair is dry it may need a couple of use&#x27;s. But I really like it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many natural conditioners and this is my top! I have very curly, thick, dry hair. And it moisturized very well, didn&#x27;t leave build up and untangled my hair. Also the scent is very pleasant, woodsy vanilla scent. I am sensitive to smells but the smell isn&#x27;t so overpowering to make you sneeze the whole time. It truly left my hair &amp;#34;like silk&amp;#34;. I have a video review over this product as well as the Argan shampoo @ http://youtu.be/wQGHko9EDRU</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, my hair has never been so healthy and full.  Love all their products.</li>
            <li> I have dry damaged hair, it makes my hair soft and normal again thank you.</li>
            <li> This product worked wonders for my dry hair and split ends. You won&#x27;t regret purchasing this. It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling heavy and over weighed. It&#x27;s nice soft and flowy.</li>
            <li> This Conditioner when paired with the Argan Shampoo make for amazing hair restoration combination. I&#x27;ve had a bad history with fizzy and dry hair that it was really hard to manage and style. It was terrible but then I came across these 2 products on Amazon and decided to give it a try since it had really good reviews. Once the products came, I use them the night off and there was tremendous difference in softness and control. It was amazing, it likes Jesus came to bless my hair, it was better to style and definitely healthier. I definitely recommend this product to anyone who feels like they need &amp;#34;repair&amp;#34; done on their hair or just want a quality shampoo and conditioner. The results/difference are apparent immediately after use.</li>
            <li> I recently used this product at a girlfriend of mines, house. I absolutely loved it!!! I have very bad dry scalp and flakes and this stuff really helped me! Love it!!</li>
            <li> This is the best conditioner ever, I&#x27;m natural with super dry hair this helps me keep from been dry. I will never purchase another conditioner</li>
            <li> This Product is AMAZING! It makes my hair feel really soft.</li>
            <li> I have tried this product in hopes of helping my dry brittle hair.. i was amazed by how wonderful it had worked, its made my hair feel so healthy and great looking, a product i would recommend to anyone with these issues</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner, it smells like vanilla cupcake -works very well - my hair is very soft</li>
            <li> I have been looking for an organic shampoo for awhile now, My friend recommended me to try this because she said it was nice and made her hair feel nice. I bought this and gave this product a try. This is my new conditioner, it leaves my hair smelling so lovely as well as smooth and not brittle. I started to notice the difference in my hair after about the 4th use. I definitely will be buying this product for now on. If you have damaged hair or want to use an organic shampoo definitely give this shampoo a try. You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> Love the conditioner. It is the only one could find that worked for my hair</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t anything special for me.</li>
            <li> Love this product, and can&#x27;t say enough about it. I have extremely curly hair and always had trouble with it being frizzy. When using this product it has helped with that! Also love that it is sulfate free.</li>
            <li> A co-worker of mine recommended this product to me and with all this frizzy coarse curly mixed hair I&#x27;m always willing to try ANYTHING!  My hair is so dry it&#x27;s really hard to find a product that works. So far so goood. I post another review in a week with an update :)</li>
            <li> I have gone through the gamut of natural, paraben-free, sulfate-free shampoos and conditioners, until finally stumbling upon the Maple Holistics brand. After reading through tons of reviews, I decided to try the Silk18 Conditioner, and I am so glad I did! I immediately fell in love with this product. The smell is delightful, the conditioner is thick, and it leaves my hair soft, silky, and never greasy. In the past I have always found either the consistency of natural conditioners to be off (typically more runny than what I prefer) or I have had a problem with my hair just seeming kind of lifeless after their use, but not with this Maple Holistics conditioner. I have thick, long, very straight hair, and this conditioner does just the trick. After using it for a couple of months, I recently got my haircut and my hairdresser commented on my &amp;#34;beautiful mermaid&amp;#34; hair - she couldn&#x27;t believe how much it had grown in such a short amount of time! I use the Silk18 conditioner in rotating combination with the Degrease shampoo and the Argan shampoo. The Argan shampoo helps keep my hair soft, while I use the Degrease shampoo as more of a once-a-week clarifying shampoo. I am so happy to have found this brand of hair products that meets all of my requirements and far surpasses my expectations.</li>
            <li> wish I could see a difference in my hair..but I don&#x27;t.  I don&#x27;t know what I will do with the rest of it...why use it, but I won&#x27;t waste it...maybe I will give it away to a family member to try.</li>
            <li> I got it today and used it once, it is very good. my hair feels  very smooth.</li>
            <li> This is much better than the usual Pantene conditioner, or the drugstore hair conditioners I&#x27;ve used before.  I can notice the difference after I use it - with this conditioner, my hair is softer and shinier.  I thought that my hair would always be damaged because I did too much hair coloring, but thankfully I found this conditioner to restore it to better quality.  The conditioner smells really good too.</li>
            <li> I bought Silk 18 conditioner and Argan oil Shampoo from Maple Holistics. I used it only 3 times so far and I have been more than satisfied of these products. Before these 2 products, various shampoo and conditioner I tried used to leave my hair dry and frizzy, and I used to loose natural texture of my hairs. That&#x27;s not the case with Argan oil shampoo and silk 18 conditioner. My hair becomes even smoother and softer.  That&#x27;s the main reason I started using these and I am glad it stand upto my expectation. I will see how it works in the long run, but at this point I intend to continue using these for long.  Giving it 4 stars(more of 4 and 1/2) as I think bottles are bit too slick and so holds less quantity, should be more for the price.</li>
            <li> If you have long and/or thick hair, this makes your hair greasy and fro&#x27;d out. It makes my scalp itchy too. I don&#x27;t understand the positive reviews because I read those before I purchased this and those people either have no hair or they&#x27;re not operating on all cylinders because this conditioner sucks.</li>
            <li> I have an oily scalp and dry hair, and live in a very dry climate. I&#x27;ve been a sucker for conditioners my entire post-pubescent life when my hair changed to this monstrosity it is. I have very few conditioners that I buy a second time. Silk18 has just replaced the only other conditioner I will buy over and over again. I like how light it is, but it does a great job! I don&#x27;t have to condition every night when I use Silk18, but I can still shampoo without over drying my hair. I have to shampoo pretty frequently because of my oily scalp. This will be a staple in my shower. I can&#x27;t wait to try some of their other products to see if they also perform as well!</li>
            <li> This conditioner has a light, pleasant scent and works well--it leaves my dry hair feeling smooth and soft, and my wintertime static is under control. I have medium, straight-wavy hair that has been falling out a bit due to illness, and this conditioner makes it feel much better.&lt;br /&gt;Update:  the last several bottles I&#x27;ve purchased smell kind of funky. I&#x27;m not purchasing this anymore.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product a couple weeks ago after researching ingredients and reading many reviews. I am so glad I did. First of all, the scent is heavenly. It&#x27;s a delicious vanilla scent that becomes more mild but still smells great over time. Secondly, it leaves my hair really soft and smooth. I have thick hair and a lot of it. I don&#x27;t have to use very much of the product to get its intended results. I am extremely happy with this product and only wish they sold it in a much larger size.</li>
            <li> I have used many products by maple holistics&amp;#62; This conditioner is by far my favorite! I have tried many conditioners that claim to be organic or natural and they always leave my hair nasty feeling dry and course.this conditioner does the opposite. It leaves my hair tangle free, smooth, soft and it smells really good! I tried the no poo method and it did not work so I just use this and literally only wash and condition my hair with maple holistic shampoo and this conditioner once a week even sometimes longer. Stays clean and manageable at least a week!  Fast shipping,  (except once I experienced delayed shipping but was given a refund for all the inconvenience , great products!  I love love love it and would recommend to everyone</li>
            <li> love this product very conditioning</li>
            <li> Not only are the ingredients safe, but my hair is super soft and smooth after only a few weeks of using. This is my new go-to conditioner!</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this conditoner and felt it wouldn&#x27;t be fair to post a review without actually trying it for a period of time.  I am AMAZED and a customer for life! The smell is wonderful, my hair is incredibly soft, and my curls are actually formed and soft rather than poofed out everywhere! I&#x27;m not sure whether it was due to the Silk 18 conditioner, the Argan Shampoo or a combination of both but I am incredibly pleased!</li>
            <li> Free of alcohol and drying chemicals. Everything listed in the ingredients was completely natural. Made my hair super soft and smell great. New staple conditioner.</li>
            <li> It smells fantastic! It has a warm vanilla extract scent that makes my hair smell good even after i get out of the shower. I love this conditioner and I will buy it again from the seller, thank you maple holistics!</li>
            <li> After using it, my hair feels stiff. It&#x27;s not silky and is tough to comb. It&#x27;s pretty expensive for such a small bottle.</li>
            <li> This conditioner makes my hair feel silky, look shiny, and allows me to comb through my thick, wavy hair much more easily without needing to use a leave-in conditioner. And the best part is that it&#x27;s a holistic product that doesn&#x27;t make me worry about what I&#x27;m putting on my body. I highly recommend this product :)</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner, PLEASE consider making it larger oz.</li>
            <li> Returned this after a week.  Did not work as well as my standard Pantene for me.</li>
            <li> I really liked this conditioner only because of how organic it felt and how it left my hair and scalp after use. Using a bit more than a pea size amount left my hair soft and my scalp really relaxed. I am definitely going to buy more of this in the future.</li>
            <li> Would Love to try the silk 18!! Love having soft hair!!</li>
            <li> I bought this product a few times and I really like it. It made my hair feel soft and helped with the dryness. I have extremely dry damaged hair and this conditioner really helped with that.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!! Makes my hair look great and soft!! It hard to find natural products with a good price and actually work!!</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner! It makes my hair look so healthy and silky! This is a great product to revive your hair!!</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this conditioner and leaves my hair silky. I feel good about using a natural product and a natural product that actually works well is even better.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this conditioner!! It leaves my hair silky smooth, and i notice LESS frizzies when i use it! It is gentle enough to use on the whole family! My girls love the smell of it and they say it makes them feel like they have &amp;#34;model&amp;#34; hair!</li>
            <li> I really like this conditioner. I have really thin hair and it&#x27;s the only conditioner that didn&#x27;t weigh it down after using. Will be buying again.it also made my hair smooth and silky and I really like that.</li>
            <li> This conditioner smell wonderful and left my 4b/4c hair super soft. I left it in a little longer on what it said on the bottle. I have very dry hair this made it very soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> My hair is very curly and tends towards dryness. I also hate the way it looks and feels after I use most conditioning products that are &amp;#34;designed&amp;#34; to make it less dry and more conditioned. That being said, I LOVED the way this product left my hair feeling healthier and looking less dry and frizzy! It made a world of difference, and my hair felt less damaged and not weighed down, either. Definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li> Wonderful conditioner, love the scent.</li>
            <li> I love it,It is incredible to leave my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product. I have thick coarse hair that is extremely dry from coloring, styling tools and a health issue and have several different brands on condtioner and not one came close to how this one conditioned my hair. It was soft and managable after the first use. And...it made my hair smell wonderful.</li>
            <li> This product is very good......makes my hair frizz free and soft. The smell of this product is very nice. I gave 4 stars because the bottle is made with very hard material and not easy to release the conditioner.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. I have long, thick hair and I usually need an excessive amount of conditioner. With this product, I only use a quarter sized amount and that was plenty! It makes my hair soft and smooth and it smells amazing! I will definitely be buying again. And customer service beats all expectations! Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;ve finally found a conditioner which is good for my hair.  They were literally more silky after this conditioner comparing to the otheres.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner!!! I have seen a huge improvement in my dry, brittle ends! It is thick and luxurious and I love that it is a holistic product. My hair does NOT become greasy as most intensive moisturizers tend to do. It is hard to find the right balance, but I think this product does an amazing job of delivering just the right amount of moisture! The only thing that is off to me about it is that it smells like chocolate or cake. It&#x27;s not a bad smell, just different, as I prefer fresh, clean smelling hair products.</li>
            <li> A little background-I purchased this conditioner via my husband&#x27;s Amazon account. My hair became very dull and I experienced some hair breakage after having my hair hi-lited. I also thought that a lot of the hair that was falling out while I was conditioning my hair in the shower was due to the fact that it was in very bad shape or a seasonal thing. (Note: I had been using a very high end conditioner &amp; matching shampoo by a company that makes professional/salon haircolor). The good news: Silk 18 Conditioner delivers on so many levels! It adds moisture and shine AND I noticed right away that I didn&#x27;t have large amounts of hair falling out anymore-really! And lastly, it has a lovely, soft sent. :-)</li>
            <li> Love the conditioner!! My hair have never felt so moisturized but not greasy!</li>
            <li> I color my hair a lot, and unfortunately it has been through a lot of abuse with bleach and heat styling. I&#x27;ve tried a ton of products to keep my hair from frizzing and falling out and after just one use of this along with their argon oil shampoo my hair felt so much softer and wasn&#x27;t as brittle as it was before :) It&#x27;s hard to go back to other conditioners when I run out of this one because they never really help my hair that much.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 bottles of this conditioner, together with 2 different types of shampoo of the same brand. I understand the product is highly/purely natural, however it does little as a conditioner. My hair feels very dry. It hardly justifies the very high price paid for such a small bottle.</li>
            <li> I was sceptical of this conditioner because I had never heard of this company before, but I was impressed.  My hair is naturally very dry and coarse so good conditioner is very important.  I would use this again, it works well and has a pleasant scent too!</li>
            <li> So happy i discovered this product! its only been a week or so using this and i can definitely feel a difference. My hair feels truly healthy so far. I will absolutely be trying other maple holistic products out because of this conditioner.</li>
            <li> First impression when I opened the bottle and took a whiff: delicious sweet vanilla scent, yum!  First impression when I was in the shower and put some in my hand: liked that it wasn&#x27;t runny and was a good thick consistency but still easily spreadable through my hair so I didn&#x27;t need to use a lot.  Has good &#x27;slip&#x27; for a natural product that isn&#x27;t full of silicones like cheaper conditioners that only make your hair feel good temporarily but make it worse over time.  First impression as I let my hair air dry: my usually dry curly hair that frizzes if you look at it the wrong way was drying with tamed well-defined curls (as long as I didn&#x27;t touch or mess them up in any way but that&#x27;s the case with ANY product I put in my hair).    After using it a few more times, my hair has only continued to look and feel better - even now in the winter where I&#x27;m around dry radiator heat all day! - so I can&#x27;t wait to see how it looks when I finish the bottle.</li>
            <li> I am a professional hairstylist for 15 years and have used MANY shampoo and conditioner products and out of ALL of them this is the BEST conditioner to repair and rejuvenate damaged hair!!! Can also be used on all types of keratin treated and color/chemical treated hair!</li>
            <li> I am always looking for a product that will add to the health of my hair. Silk 18 is one of those products that&#x27;s doing just that. It contains good ingredients that not only feeds my hair, but naturally moisturizes and tames my persistent frizz. It has a subtle vanilla smell that&#x27;s not over-powering and dissipates quickly.  I like this product a lot.</li>
            <li> Very gentle to my hair and I feel it help in giving volume to my thinning hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick, wavy hair that can be very hard to control and brush through. I was looking for a conditioner that was free of fragrance but could get the job done.. I am so happy with this product! I love the vanilla scent and even more, I love knowing that I&#x27;m not putting harsh chemicals into my hair.</li>
            <li> Great product! love it</li>
            <li> This is really awesome conditioner.  It leaves my hair very light feeling and soft.  It&#x27;s expensive but I really like it.  I am used to paying this much or more at a salon and those items are chemical laden and cause buildup in my fine hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got thick, somewhat coarse hair and this conditioner softens it up like no other conditioner I have used and there is no greasy residue left over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product to anyone with thick hair as I can&#x27;t speak for any other type of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will be in my shower for a long time.</li>
            <li> This is the first I tried this product. I was looking for a Sulfate-free product because I&#x27;m allergic to sulfate. My hair is very fine so I don&#x27;t like a thick heavy conditioner. This was very light and didn&#x27;t weigh my hair down. I also liked the scent, not too much but enough, it has a light sweet almond smell. I would definitely buy again and recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I carefully searched for shampoo and conditioner to help my dull hair and the reviews made me think this was just the ticket. Not! No better than anything I already bought at WalMart which is really disappointing</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I used it right away after I received it. I bought this after I read all the review. I am going to use it for while&lt;br /&gt;and see how it works. I believe it will control my hair fall.</li>
            <li> After reading all the stellar reviews, I was excited to try this product.  After using it a couple of times, I don&#x27;t see or feel any difference in my very long, very fine, chemically treated hair..  That said, I will continue to use until gone and update my review if anything should change.</li>
            <li> I tried this product yesterday and I am already in love with it. I have very little hair, and on top of that it is extremely thin.&lt;br /&gt;I have to start by its scent of vanilla, it is delightful. It left my hair extremely silky and with volume. I have been looking for the right conditioner for my type of hair and I am glad to say that I have finally found it. I will definitively keep buying this product.</li>
            <li> Great stuff! I have curly unruly  hair and i have tried a lot of different products to tame them. After the first use of Silk 18 my hair felt soft, silky and LIGHT and i love the smell.  So far im very happy with this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;Its pricey for the size of the bottle but honestly you dont need much.</li>
            <li> Great conditioner for my thin,frizzy and dry damaged hair.  My hair already looks stronger and healthier and I have only used it once with the Maple Holistics organ oil shampoo.  A fabulous combination!!!</li>
            <li> Love this product. Works instantly and smells amazing. Works on any type of hair.</li>
            <li> Great stuff! I like trying different conditioners for my natural hair. This made my hair feel silky with a nice slip and soft. No oily build build, light weight.&lt;br /&gt;I will use again and add to my staples of hair care products.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and my hair feels great after using it.</li>
            <li> I recently decided to embrace my curls and was looking for a conditioner that wouldn&#x27;t weigh down my hair, but would still leave my curls soft and handle the frizziness. So far, I have been happy with this conditioner and plan to buy it again. The product also smells great. The one complaint is that the bottle is such thick plastic that it can be hard to squeeze at times.</li>
            <li> This makes my dry, dull hair look and feel soft, shiny, and moisturized.  Even though its not meant to be used as a co wash, I have also been using it as one.  I like the natural vanilla scent too.  My only complaint is that the price is high for such a small amount, which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.  I would like to use only this conditioner from now on, but the cost is too high, so I will alternate between this and something more cost effective.</li>
            <li> I have a very thin ended hair, always tangled up. I love the condtioner, now i am going to oder the shampoo. My hair is shine and manageable since i am using, maple holistic products. I am also happy to use something in my hair what is not full with harsh chemicals.  Love this product,  smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> Love this brand of shampoo &amp; conditioner. I came upon it on a search for hair products that were natural. I&#x27;m a 50 yo woman who needs to preserve and take care of every little hair on my head. This product has strengthened my hair and has made my hair appear fuller. It has also added shine and bounce to my hair. My hair truly hasn&#x27;t looked this healthy since I was in my twenties! No joke.</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;m not certain that I&#x27;m allergic to it (it&#x27;s spring; I&#x27;m allergic, period), the vanilla fragrance is way too strong.  It&#x27;s so strong that it took hours and multiple washings for the smell to leave my hands.  And, it doesn&#x27;t condition as well as my usual DHS conditioner (which is mediocre).  I&#x27;ve already ordered a different conditioner, and this one will be going in the trash.</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner! It makes my hair so silky smooth and smells like warm vanilla sugar!</li>
            <li> Love this! I have so many chemical allergies it is very hard for me to find a product that I can use and that I like. This works awesome on my fine hair. Will definitely continue to purchase this</li>
            <li> I give this product a 4-stars.  First of all, I like the smell (vanilla scent).  Second, since I have very fine hair, I only need to use a small amount on the ends and it already smooths out my hair.  This bottle size can last me up to two or conservatively three months.  Another thing I like about it is that it&#x27;s 100% natural.  I feel my hair look healthier after using it.  So I strong recommend this!</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best conditioner i have ever used. Pleasant smell, not heavy, smoothes hair, calms frizzies and fuzzy ends. I&#x27;ve ordered 2 more so I don&#x27;t run out. Since my hair started turning grey, it has changed texture, become thinner and finer. This conditioner brings out the best in your hair. It helps my hair look more like it did 10 years ago. Great product.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is so amazing. I have recently been suffering from alopecia areata monolocularis . My doctor recommended me using all natural hair products and some treatments. I tried several natural hair products but they made my hair unmanageable,tangle;therefore, I looked at a lot of fallen hair while brushing.  I spent many days to find another natural hair products and I found this product. Using this for 3 weeks, my hair looks healthy and soft, so I&#x27;m never afraid of brushing my hair any more. I know this product doesn&#x27;t heal or cure my alopecia areata monolocularis but at least this one helps me to relieve stress from losing hair with brushing. I don&#x27;t want to lose my hair anymore, so I will use this one while I have being treated for alopecia areata.</li>
            <li> This product is a pleasant-smelling conditioner that left my hair silky ams shiny. It is a great option for those who wish to avoid chemicals yet still want gorgeous hair.</li>
            <li> I have dry, curly,frizzy hair.  I have been trying to find a more natural conditioner and gave this a shot.  I love it.  It smells awesome--a light vanilla scent.  It leaves me with softer curls instead of a frizz bomb.  I will definitely buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Silk 18 rocks. There is no other conditioner on the market that can match this product.</li>
            <li> I used this on mine and my daughters hair... I LOVE IT. she had very tangled hair and is extremely tender headed. She didn&#x27;t say ouch even once!!! Amazing!!</li>
            <li> This is by far, the best conditioner I have ever used!  This is my 3rd or 4th bottle, and I&#x27;m a happy camper!</li>
            <li> I wanted to find a product that was all natural but actually worked, which until now, i didnt think was possible.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this because of the really good reviews and am thrilled to see it is all true.&lt;br /&gt;I noticed immediately after my first wash with the shampoo followed by this conditioner that my hair was unbelievable silky and smooth, unlike any other product ive used, and believe me ive tried many.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately I have long and thick hair so I have to use a lot of product and this is more expensive, but it is totally worth it to me.&lt;br /&gt;I am hooked!</li>
            <li> Makes my fine and &amp;#34;too often straightened with a flat iron&amp;#34; hair seem soft. Maybe for me a bit too soft, but I like the product as a protection for my hair.</li>
            <li> I have used this product twice after receiving it last week. I was nervous to buy another natural haircare product after trying something I found at Whole Foods that left my hair tangled, dull and dry like straw. I returned to familiar (&amp; expensive) non-natural products but my desire to ditch the chemicals persevered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has made my high volume, naturally wavy, fine hair (read: shrivels and dries up at the flick of a straightener switch) soft and easy to tame without weighing it down. I condition my hair twice a week and my hair has actually looked better around the second and third day than it does on the first and I believe it&#x27;s because this product works with my natural oils rather than against it. Minus one star because the scent is not my favorite but it&#x27;s not strong and my hair smells like hair after one day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank goodness for Amazon reviews that allow a person to really research a product before purchasing it. Consider this one a thumbs up! I will be trying a shampoo from this company next.</li>
            <li> I bought this conditioner based on reviews, and I love it.  I was pleasantly surprised with how soft my hair was after using this conditioner and didn&#x27;t feel at all heavy or flat.This conditioner moisturizes hair very well, and it makes for a great deep conditioner.Loved this smell of this conditioner, very subtly sweet and delicious. I am pretty particular about conditioners but I really like this one.</li>
            <li> Just okay, nothing special. The bottle was also hard to squeeze. Smells great though.</li>
            <li> This product is just great!!! I can honestly say this product is amazing on my hair and the vanilla scent is so good. It hydrates my hair this is beyond the best product I have used other than my other shampoos and conditioners and none of them are good but this one!!</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful.  Feels great going on. I found that I cannot put too much on and only on the ends of my hair or it gives me a bit of a greasy feeling.  I am only on my second use though and my hair feels pretty good.</li>
            <li> This product, honestly and truly, is a miracle product. I know, I know- you&#x27;ve heard it before. You&#x27;ve tried argan oil, conditioning treatments, overnight creams, curl cream, mousse, keratin, coconut oil, and pretty much every brand of shampoo/conditioner on the shelf. LOOK NO FURTHER THAN THIS PRODUCT. First of all, I am including pictures on a review for the first time ever because 1.) obviously, you have to see the before/after difference and 2.) I want you to all be assured that when I say I have poofy hair, I actually mean POOFY HAIR. I straightened my already unruly hair for years and years during middle school/high school/most of college since that was the trend at the time, plus it&#x27;s often easier to just straighten it and get it out of my face. Often I would cause even more damage by straightening it, and then proceeding to curl it to avoid frizz. On top of all that, I have continuously bleached my hair for more years in a row than I can count (hair dressers hate me for it, but damn I just love being blonde!) Blow drying my hair is a nightmare- unless it&#x27;s using a diffuser and careful hand movements, don&#x27;t even think about it. Even using the diffuser didn&#x27;t really help at all. The only way I could really wear my hair naturally curly was my letting it air dry, and who has TIME for that with how thick our hair is?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, just to sum things up so far, I have been struggling with trying to get defined, soft, natural-looking curls for years. I hesitated to buy this product because nothing else had ever worked, and I didn&#x27;t want to get my hopes up again. I&#x27;m telling you right now- if this worked on my hair texture, I feel extremely confident in saying that you should not be worried about encountering yet another dud product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Silk18 does not feel like your average conditioner when you apply it. You will not immediately be able to run your hands through your hair, and it will not feel silky while it&#x27;s wet. Though this might sound unappealing, I was actually extremely excited to feel the strange texture because this meant that it really was unlike any other product I&#x27;ve tried. The scent is strong in the shower- there are wonderful vanilla and maple hues, and the scent is just the right amount of subtle when your hair dries (my boyfriend really likes it too!). I appreciated that the small card that comes with the product informs you: &amp;#34;Shampoo is for the scalp, conditioner is for the hair!&amp;#34; This has forever changed the way I will wash my hair. So, I used the shampoo I had (Aussie moisterizing) to my scalp, rinsed, and then I applied Silk18 just before shaving my legs so it could sit for awhile. Then I rinsed the conditioner out with cold water. I wasn&#x27;t sure how much to use though- I felt like I had to use a bit more than expected to cover my hair, which is fine, but I wish there were bigger bottles available because I might end up running through this one pretty quickly! I then brushed my hair, crimp-dried it with a towel, and then let it air dry. I was so happy with the results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am including three pictures- the first one (it&#x27;s a few years old, sorry!) is an example of what happens to my hair when I attempt to blow dry it straight; this is partially for your amusement and partly to show just how annoying it is to try and get ready quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second before is my &amp;#34;before&amp;#34; picture. This was taken after using Aussie shampoo/conditioner, letting my hair dry on its own for a little under an hour, and then using a diffuser to finish drying it. Notice that even though I have really dry hair, the texture is a bit greasy looking. The shape of the curls themselves aren&#x27;t very consistent at all, and the silhouette of the style is unusual (flat in some places, voluminous in others).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The third is my &amp;#34;after&amp;#34; picture! Silk18 makes my hair look less brassy, and evened out the shape of the curls and made them much bouncier. I think it&#x27;s important to say that the top of my hair is EXTREMELY damaged from bleaching/straightening- the curls underneath formed thick, perfect ringlets and looked even better than my top layer...so even though I know it still looks very poofy to some, just know that this is seriously such a huge improvement for me. My hope is that this product will allow me to stop relying on a straightener so that my hair can heal- I will be updating this post later to update you guys on how the top layer looks after using this product in place of a straightener for awhile, and whether my relationship with blow dryers has improved! I am also eager to try out the shampoo products from this company now that I&#x27;ve seen what the conditioner can do; I hope there are other conditioning treatments available in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for reading about my experience, and I hope this works out as well for you as it did for me! THANK YOU MAPLE HOLISTICS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Added a couple more pictures (fourth and fifth) after trying a new hair styling routine. I DID NOT brush my hair before squeezing it with a towel, and then I used a diffuser (this product works with a blowdryer!!!) after spraying OGX&#x27;s Weightless Healing Oil Mist into my damp hair. WOW what a difference! Now I am even more pleased with Silk18, this stuff is such a life saver!f my hair is EXTREMELY damaged from bleaching/straightening- the curls underneath formed thick, perfect ringlets and looked even better than my top layer...so even though I know it still looks very poofy to some, just know that this is seriously such a huge improvement for me.

            <li> I really wanted to like this conditioner after all the rave reviews but I&#x27;m just not very impressed. I have fine hair but it&#x27;s coarse and tends to frizz easily. This conditioner doesn&#x27;t seem to offer many benefits for my hair. After using it, my hair isn&#x27;t any softer or smoother or better conditioned than less expensive natural conditioners out there. It does smell really good but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> After this VERY harsh Northeast winter, my poor bleach-blonde hair felt so straw-like and terrible, so I started looking at deep conditioners. I found this but was so hesitant to use it because my hair felt so fragile...but after leaving it in the duration of my shower then rinsing it out (maybe 10 minutes) my hair feels silky again!!!! I really cannot believe the difference! And I&#x27;m so eager for the future when this product is nourishing my hair instead of saving it from the brink of winter&#x27;s cold, dry vengeance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A serious 10 stars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve definitely noticed a difference, wish the bottle was a little bigger.</li>
            <li> Feels like normal conditioner, doesn&#x27;t do much for my hair (asian). Maybe it&#x27;ll be more effective for other hair types.</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner!  Makes my hair super shiny and soft!  Will continue to buy!</li>
            <li> Works great, bought 2 more....wifey loved it</li>
            <li> Used it for the first time. WOW!!! My hair is so smooth and shiny. My hair has not looked and felt this good in ages. I love this product! Best conditioner I have used.</li>
            <li> I love the way my hair smells after I use this.  The vanilla and honey is so nice.  My hair is nice and smooth and looks nice.  I would absolutely purchase this in the future.  Really glad I purchased this in combination with the Argan Oil Shampoo I also bought from Maple Holistics because that leaves my hair not only clean, but tangled.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is great. It smells lovely (like coco butter) and leaves my hair very smooth! Pairs great with their Sage Shampoo for Heavy Dandruff!</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner.  I have very fragile hair that breaks easily.  After using this I noticed less breakage after my shower.  It also helped with tangles.  I really love that it is natural and organic.  Wonderful product.</li>
            <li> Great conditioner! And smells lovely. :)</li>
            <li> Only used once. So far so good.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS! It leaves my hair super soft and smelling wonderful! Most surprising to me is that the scent lasts for days! I bought Silk 18 because I wanted to stop using hair products that contain harmful chemicals. I am never going back to any other conditioner again! I currently practice the &amp;#34;No Poo&amp;#34; (No Shampoo) method of cleaning my hair so a good conditioner is important to me. Washing my hair with Silk 18 leaves it feeling clean and fresh. I&#x27;m definitely going to order a few more bottles.</li>
            <li> Like it it make my hair look pretty and silky</li>
            <li> I have never written a review but this product needed praise! I have naturally curly hair and have tried everything out there... This conditioner at this price doesn&#x27;t compare to anything out there. It&#x27;s absolutely wonderful on my curly hair and like the name it truly feels silky after I&#x27;m done showering. I continue to buy this and won&#x27;t use anything else. The shampoo is amazing as well!</li>
            <li> Silk 18 conditioner is the best i have used so far. i have thin and dry hair. this adds body and shine. more softer. does not dry my hair out after blow drying.  does not weigh my hair down. love it:) I use it with argan oil sulfate free shampoo.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this conditioner. A little bit goes a very long way! Will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> Before entering this review I used 2 bottles of this wonderful conditioner. I used to washed my hair every day, but because of this natural product I wash it every other day. Because of this conditioner my hair is full, smooth, shiny, thick, healthy and bouncy. I also noticed that it grows much faster than ever before!!! This conditioner works wonders:)</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this stuff!! You only need a little bit and it easily spreads through my thick curly hair. My hair is left soft, shiny, and smelling FANTASTIC!! I&#x27;ve tried just about every kind of conditioner under the sun and this one is by FAR the best with both quality and price. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner. I use it with the argan oil shampoo. It has a delicious smell and leaves my hair feeling soft and smooth. I bought this for myself but it seems that my brother loves it too as the bottle is nearly empty and I feel like I just bought it! I&#x27;ll have to buy another one again soon!</li>
            <li> Nice smelling, good to know no toxic ingredients.</li>
            <li> Smells great and after only a couple uses my hair feels extremely soft. Also a little goes a long way which is nice because when I initally got the bottle I was surprised by how small it was.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t a bad conditioner, but it isn&#x27;t great.  Yes for Carrots actually leaves my hair softer than this which is surprising.  I will not be buying this again.  It does have a really good vanilla smell.</li>
            <li> I received a sample to try it before buying it myself. This product works like magic!! I have dry, frizzy curly hair and this made it smell nice and feel soft after the first wash. I will definitely stock up on this conditioner and recommend it to my friends</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy I Googled best frizzy hair products.  I found this gem.  My adjectives for this product are &amp;#34;smooth, silky, light, with a light smell of vanilla almond&amp;#34;.  My hair is color treated (blond) and takes a beating each time I lighten my hair and when I go out in the sun.  This conditioner makes a big difference with the frizzies and smoothes out my semi wavy hair.</li>
            <li> Thank you Maple Holistics!&lt;br /&gt;My hair is now so smooth and shining.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner! I have been using Aveda on my stylist&#x27;s recommendation but have found that it seems to be drying my hair so I went on a search for a similar but more hydrating product and I think this is the one for me! I have fairly long, color treated hair that is very fine but there is a ton of it and I really like a thick conditioner that I can comb through in the shower as well as after its rinsed out. I dont want to have to fight to comb or use a detangler, I feel like that is the conditioner&#x27;s job.  This didn&#x27;t work great with the Aveda shampoo (but that&#x27;s prolly the shampoo) but works much better with my Pureology and now that I have faith I am definitely going to order the Argan Oil shampoo from Maple Holistics because I think it will work even better with that. I have a tendency to test the conditioner because it is more important to me than what shampoo I use. I am pretty darn picky when it comes to conditioners and I think this is well worth the money. I can go a couple days without washing and it doesn&#x27;t get oily and I can even go without gel or any other styling products if I want which is a huge bonus for me.  Great product!!</li>
            <li> I have used this for about a week now. I have course thick hair with natural texture And it can be a pain! But this week it has needed very little muss and fuss....which I adore! I prefer not to spend too much time and energy on my hair and hate having to blow dry and straighten. This conditioner has helped me wear my hair natural and not feel like a frizzy lion mane mess. One week has made a difference. The photo has no additional product just freshly washed and conditioned.</li>
            <li> Love it! Silky smooth feel and shine. Really helps keep over processed (heat, color sprays) smooth and manageable!</li>
            <li> After using this conditioner, my hair was noticeably softer and more easy to manage. I have dry hair and my hair wasn&#x27;t as dry after using this.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m the type of person that loves my hair products to smell good, this product unfortunately doesn&#x27;t have a smell. But it does make it softer which I love. :)</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading many positive reviews but it does not perform that well. I just spent $20 on a so so conditioner.</li>
            <li> Okay, so I ran out of conditioner and was using some really drying (and ironically expensive keratin shampoo) for a week before I received this conditioner.  My thick, wavy, color treated hair was a mess.  It was frizzy, dry and totally unmanageable.  I ordered Silk18 Natural Conditioner based on favorable reviews, and the fact that it has naturally based ingredients.  I received my order quickly and upon use, immediately noticed a difference in my hair.  The dryness and frizz were gone.  And this product did not leave my hair greasy, even after a couple of days of not washing my hair.  The only reason this product received 4 stars and not 5 stars was cost ($14 seems just a little high).  I also bought Maple Holistics Argan Oil condition for under $6 and can&#x27;t wait to try that product out.</li>
            <li> My teenage daughter and I love this conditioner. I just bought our 5th bottle (although it is worth noting that a little does go a long way, however with my daughter being a swimmer, she is washing/conditioning every day so we go through a lot!)  We both have very thick hair that is prone to frizz.  I have always had to use more expensive brands of shampoos and conditioners and we have tried more brands and spent more money than I care to recall over the years! This conditioner really helps smooth, soften and tame and it smells great too!  It is also worth noting that I have been impressed with the company.  Shipping has always been quick and they have great customer service which I experienced with a shampoo that I tried that was not suitable for me.  Will continue to purchase this product.</li>
            <li> It is light weight, smells great and makes my hair feel soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I am so impressed with this conditioner. The first thing I noticed was obviously the smell. It&#x27;s smells incredible. It has a wonderful vanilla scent that doesn&#x27;t smell like the cheap vanilla many products have. I have thick, dry, curly, frizzy hair and i used a small amount of this conditioner and my hair was so soft. It felt better than I can ever remember. I don&#x27;t think the price is a bit high for an average family for the size of the product but it it a fantastic product. Also there is no reference to the size of the product in its description and is not visible on the picture of he bottle.</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping it would make my hair more moisturized. I normally leave my conditioner in for a few minutes then rinse it out. I did that here and I rinsed it out immediately (to see if there was different results. There wasn&#x27;t) It actually died out my hair and made it smell like Playdoh. My hair got so tangly and dry after this. I definitely don&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is amazing! I have fairly wavy hair that usually gets a bit frizzy. This conditioner is helping my natural hair shows its waves without the frizz I normally had to deal with.</li>
            <li> I started using this product in September of 2014 and it has made a big difference in my hair... it has helped to prevent snarls and tangles tremendously.  It also smells heavenly and my hair keeps that fragrance for days.  I am in my late 60&#x27;s and my  long hair is now  naturally shiny and very healthy...it was dull and unattractive before I started using this product... I also use the Argan oil shampoo in the red bottle.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, Maple Holistics, for a truly helpful product!</li>
            <li> I have long hair that is often dry and frizzy, this conditioner leaves my hair soft and manageable.  It&#x27;s a little more than I usually spend on conditioner but i&#x27;d say this is worth the extra money.  I&#x27;ve tried a few different products from Maple Holistics and have been impressed with most so far but this conditioner is awesome! It&#x27;s definitely a heavy duty conditioner that leaves hair light and silky.</li>
            <li> First, I love that it is all natural with no suspicious chemicals. The scent is nice, kind of vanilla almond. I might have preferred it to be a little lighter but it is milder and doesn&#x27;t last on my hair which I like. It leaves my hair soft and silky. I haven&#x27;t tried it yet as a leave in conditioner but I definitely will based on prior reviews. I will definitely be buying this again!</li>
            <li> I used this conditioner after using their Aragan Jojoba shampoo. Silk 18 distributed evenly and rinsed out easily. The scent was light and clean. I would use this conditioner again.</li>
            <li> I Love it .. its just amazing</li>
            <li> This conditioner is ok. Would recommend, but not my favorite. The smell is good, but not amazing: maple/sugar with notes of something like tree bark. Other people like the smell of my hair when I use it, though. It makes my hair softer than if I didn&#x27;t use it, but it&#x27;s not the best conditioner out there, despite other rave reviews. I have used better at a better price (try Aussie&#x27;s 3 Minute Miracle, $2.99, for that price it really is a miracle).</li>
            <li> (Not Doug-wife here!!) It took me a long time to find this conditioner!! I LOVE it, my husband LOVES the way my hair smells and how it makes my hair look! I finaly found the Curly Girl Method, and was searching for a sulfate free product, and this one is GREAT! I have thick curly hair hair down to the middle of my back, and this bottle lasted me a month, and I am now ordering my second bottle! I don&#x27;t think I will use anything else! I leave a little of this in my hair, not completely rinsing it, and I have shiny soft locks that have pretty individual curls after scrunching gel into it after I get out of the shower. LOVE this conditioner!! I also use it on my 5 yr old daughter&#x27;s hair, and it leaves it gleaming! She has thin mostly straight hair, and it reflected light really well after using this!</li>
            <li> I love this product!  My hair feels soft and manageable after using it with out weighing it down.  I have used it  to tame my frizzes in between shampoos.  I will definitely re order Silk 18!</li>
            <li> I like the scent and my hair feels very soft, so overall I would say the product is great. But uI&#x27;m concerned for the customer who had a rash form after using this product and the company never responded - that doesn&#x27;t make me very comfortable so I may or may not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Good product.  It didn&#x27;t make my hair as soft as I was hoping for (I would need a miracle!), but it definitely made a difference in my damaged, colored hair.  For the price, it is really a good product in a good size bottle.  Should last for several months.  I would recommend!</li>
            <li> I tried this conditioner for my toddler who has extremely dry hair, to the point of every morning she wakes up with dreadlocks!  I can say it has made her hair ALOT softer and not as tangled.  I wash her her once or twice a week and sometimes just wet it and put this conditioner on it. I tried it on my hair which is neither dry nor oily and I couldn&#x27;t tell any difference but I was also being careful not to use alot because I think it is expensive.  This conditioner also smells good and my kids love the smell.  I will buy this product again.</li>
            <li> make hair looks much better and delivered fast!!！</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed the vanilla fragrance in this conditioner. It has a natural vanilla smell, not a chemical smell.  Some of the ingredients are synthetic, but there are some natural and even organically-based ingredients, as well, which is a nice change.  As a middle-aged male with thinning hair, however, this conditioner does not do anything to thicken the hair.  Not sure that it even adds volume over what any conditioner claims to do.  But I will say it does make hair very smooth and shiny, which feels great when the hair dries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is disappointingly small and quite pricey (per ounce) compared to my normal 20-33 ounce bottles of thickener conditioner, so I am using this conditioner once or twice a week.</li>
            <li> A little bit of this goes a long way. Good stuff if you like the smell of vanilla (which I certainly do).</li>
            <li> I have medium length thin to average hair, colored with henna. I used SILK 18 as deep conditioner (covered with plastic shower cup and warm towel for 20 min). Can not keep my hands from checking how smooth my hair feels.</li>
            <li> I had never heard of this product or company before seeing it while browsing for hair products on Amazon.  I tend to invest regularly in new hair products, so I though I would give this one a try as it was promoted as natural and sulfate free.  I received the product promptly and used it after my next wash.  I am very impressed with the quality of the ingrediants in this conditioner. I am a bit of a snob about product quality and this one meets the grade!  Highly recommended, at least to try to see if it works with your hair type.</li>
            <li> Awful conditioner!  This stuff dried out my hair incredibly!  I used it for a week and my hair (below shoulder length) was CRISPY dry even though I put jojoba oil on it every night to try to counteract the effect of the conditioner.  It was breaking off it was so dry, just after a few days of use!  Big waste of money.  I will stick with Arvazallia conditioner from now on.</li>
            <li> love this product.. my hair is too dry, its works great for me..</li>
            <li> I have tried almost every conditioner on the market, some of which are very expensive, to try to help manage my dry, very curly hair. After reading the reviews here I thought I might as well try it. It is simply amazing. My hair is now so much softer and more manageable. My wife is now hooked on it also. Only wish it came in a larger size.</li>
            <li> Some reviewers rave about this conditioner. I found it very average. Didn&#x27;t leave my hair as smooth as a regular product (like Pantene for example). Probably won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> My hair has never been softer or shinier. The bonus is it&#x27;s all natural. I use it with the shampoo.</li>
            <li> So far, this is one of the best conditioners I&#x27;ve used. It leaves my hair smooth. I also use their Argan and Sage shampoos. My winter dry scalp is gone and my hair does not get greasy between shampoos.</li>
            <li> I have had this product for about a month now and I enjoy it quite a bit. My hair is normal type, it is not straight, yet not really wavy. I do not have thick hair nor thin hair, it&#x27;s kind of in the middle. It is also mid length, just below the shoulders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First I will start off by saying that I only wash my hair 2-3 times a week, usually 2. I do not like to over wash my hair or use products that have harsh chemicals. I wanted to get quite a few washes in before I left a review so I can give an honest opinion of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite some reviews, I enjoy the smell. It is not overbearing for me and after it is rinsed out it leaves a slight scent. The first time I used this product and felt it in my hair I understood why they call it silk, it felt amazing! I could run my fingers through my hair and really get it worked in. I leave it on for about 5 minutes each time I use it. My hair does not feel dry or brittle, it does not leave my hair feeling oily, and there is a slight shine when it is fully dried (air dried). I really enjoy the conditioner, however, for me I feel like I need a shampoo to pair it with in order to gain the full benefits of the product. For some people this conditioner alone works just fine, but for my hair I feel like I need a little bit more (I usually always use a shampoo conditioner combo for full effect). I really do enjoy the product and will purchase a shampoo (I don&#x27;t know which one yet) and I will update and also leave a separate review  on the shampoo (it will most likely be another month before I update).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5: Since it is winter where I am I can not say how well it will work when the hot humid summer is in full swing. The price is what is expected for a product with quality ingredients and I like the smell. It is only because I want to see how it holds up in the summer that I gave it 4 out of 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*EDIT: check out my review of the Argan Oil shampoo. I wanted tosee how well they paired together. http://www.amazon.com/review/R1LNUZLDI5J70Q/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_rdp_perm?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;ASIN&#x3D;B00L4FQVB2</li>
            <li> Wow...I love how it makes my hair feel.  Works great! Will order again. TY</li>
            <li> Used it while traveling because airplanes dry out my hair. Left my hair smooth and silk. Recommend to anyone looking for a natural conditioner without chemical junk.</li>
            <li> This product left my hair soft and smelling great! I have naturally curly hair and it made my curls smoother and less frizzy.</li>
            <li> I have purchased Silk 18 twice and loved it both times! This conditioner leaves my hair silky smooth, definitely will be purchasing again. Also this company had awesome customer service Alesha-</li>
            <li> This was very moisturizing and smells wonderful. I did however send it back because I recently went fragrance free so it was too strong for me. This is a very natural conditioner that contains some great oils , I will be trying their other products to find a more mild scented one for me. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a natural moisturizing conditioner with a warm vanilla scent.</li>
            <li> Love the softness, no tangles, no buildup so my hair stays full.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a solution for my teenage daughter who deals with an itchy scalp and an oily appearance to her hair.  After only a few uses, this is remarkable!  Her hair looks clean, soft, shiny and her scalp feels great and still makes her long thick hair easy to brush with no weigh-down.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great and makes my hair feel really nice.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I have used this both as a leave in conditioner for my curly hair and as a regular conditioner and it&#x27;s awesome! It provides excellent slip and keeps my hair frizz free all day when used as a leave in!</li>
            <li> My hair stylist remarked that my hair had thickened and felt great after I started using this conditioner. I have very fine hair that can get frizzy.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for two weeks now and my hair feels great! This is the first conditioner I have used where I don&#x27;t need gobs of it to feel like I have covered my hair.</li>
            <li> I really like this product! At first it did not seem special. I tried using it in various ways, especially because I enjoy the smell. First, I attempted to use it as a detangler for my 4b curls. This was an extremely unsuccessful endeavor, as the product provided no slip whatsoever. Trying to detangle with this conditioner was basically like detangling my hair without anything and afterwards I would use my regular detangler, anyhow. In my second attempt to find usefulness of this product, I tried it as a deep conditioner. This seemed to work okay, but not as well as my other deep conditioners.  My hair seemed to absorb it all, but it still didn&#x27;t affect how my hair reacted to stress or the softness. Lastly, I attempted to use this conditioner as a leave-in conditioner. It worked beautifully. The product finally made my hair feel silky and allowed easy stretching! Also, it make my hair (and me as a whole) smell delicious all day! This product as a leave-in conditioner also holds my curls very well, without making them stiff or tough.</li>
            <li> I tried this on my AA hair and wow! The consistency is similar to Tresemme&#x27;s Natural Avocado Conditioner and the smell is heavenly! It has amazing slip and best of all, it&#x27;s a natural conditioner! You can&#x27;t beat that! I 100% recommend this to my AA sistas! :~) And if you like the Tresemme conditioner then you will absolutely looooove this! I will be purchasing more in the future! Try it girls!</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;d have to say that I&#x27;m very satisfied with Maple Holistics Silk 18. Some of my favorite things that I love is the scent and the softness it leaves in my hair. How I use this product is by washing my hair with shampoo then condition with Silk 18. I then towel dry my hair and apply more from the mid section of my hair to the ends like a leave in conditioner. I noticed from doing this my hair is becoming less frizzy. I look forward to my new hair journey with this product.</li>
            <li> I was very impressed with this product was amazing the first time I used I see the results my hair was de tangle smoth and shine and used as a leaving as my hair is curly I LOVE LOVE LOVE it!All the curly girls out there u should tried u won&#x27;t regret it and finally found it a natural product that I can use for as conditioner and leaving and the smell is really nice like vanilla my hair like a lot so now is gonna be in my list of the month I will buy again!!!Thanks u Maplejolistics for your products now I want to try the shampoo for dry hair is the blue Boyle and lavender</li>
            <li> First, the aroma keeps my shower stall freshly scented; most importantly, this conditioner has thoroughly replenished the natural oils in my hair. For specific ethnic groups, daily hair cleansing strips the natural oils required to prevent brittle hair. My hair is softer after using Silk 18 for the past 30 days. I leave the conditioner on my hair longer than the label indicates but I have short hair and it doesn&#x27;t affect my hairstyle or hair color.</li>
            <li> Love the feel of my hair after using this product. So soft, I keep running my hands through&lt;br /&gt;my hair all day. Great product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> It does in fact help a lot to soften dry hair.  My hair is now nearly down to my mid back and I live in Phoenix so it is getting dry on the bottom portion.  I&#x27;ve tried all of the conditioning treatments at Sallys etc etc...they don&#x27;t work too well.  I have fine and thin hair...this is working real good with no build up or weight.  It gets better by the week so be patient...it takes time to condition and improve...I&#x27;m at 3 weeks now and my hair is much improved.  Very happy with the results so far.  You don&#x27;t have to use a lot either.  I&#x27;m also using a dry oil spray that I found at Sallys and it is good too.</li>
            <li> Wowww simply  great  product..all natural  ingredients  and selling fast as my  sister  wants but it currently  unavailable.&lt;br /&gt;If you have damage hair you should try this.&lt;br /&gt;Very great smell ...just in one use you will fall in love.</li>
            <li> I was afraid this would be too heavy when I read the raves by women with thick curly hair -- mine is short, gray, and somewhat fine.  Not so - it leaves my hair quite manageable, no heavy residue (I do rinse out).  Great customer service, too&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update.  The vanilla grows on you.  I&#x27;m out, and I crave it, almost like ice cream.  Oh, and this stuff makes a good skin moisturizer.  I rub it on my skin after the Dead Sea mask Maple Holistics sells, then rinse off.  My skin is so much less itchy, my hair is great.  Yummy</li>
            <li> Es buenissimo!! Very impress I got curly dry hair, it does hydrate my hair and I use it for leaving condition also..MY HAIR IT&#x27;S HEALTHY VERY GOOD PRODUCT!!</li>
            <li> I were supprised when the bottle seal insdide the cap were already opened because somebody might use it already before shipping to me.</li>
            <li> This is hands-down an amazing product. I have a very dry,unruly and curly hair which frizzes so easily. I tried so many products throughout my life but my prayers were unanswered as Curly hair doesn&#x27;t suit me . I accidentally came across this product and read the reviews which turn out to be terrific and amazingly positive. I wasn&#x27;t sure with all my experience of Conditioners but i gave it a try as it was available for a reduced price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Believe me when i say that from the first use itself my hair started to feel and look way way better. I am able to comb it and the frizzyness is no where to be seen. It smells Vanilla for the first 15-20 minutes, nothing over the top. You can style your hair as you like and once at work, people started noticing the difference. The product may have found a fan for life and i would recommend this product without a second thought!</li>
            <li> My chemically treated hair soaked up this conditioner and loving it! After a few washes my hair felt thicker and softer! I really liked it. I&#x27;m ready to also try some of their other products!</li>
            <li> For me, I have curly/wavy beach hair! Before trying this amazing product my hair was dull and I decided to go homeopathic. After using this natura solution my hair completely changed and the difference was noticeable!</li>
            <li> Good good conditioner, I have tried  Kerastase Nutritive Bain Satin 2 Complete Nutrition products, Moroccan products but these conditioner is the one for my frizzy, damage hair, split ends. I could finally leave my hair alone, after showering. No need for iron or blow dry it. The smell, vanilla which I like.</li>
            <li> I looked for a product that could help my damaged hair. I came across this product and decided to give it a try, and I&#x27;m glad that I did. After only a few uses I could tell there was a difference in my hair. It was a lot softer and looked a lot healthier. This is a good product, works great!</li>
            <li> I really love how my hair looked and smelled after using this conditioner!!  I was a little skeptical at first because it wasn&#x27;t as thick and creamy as my usual conditioner, but this stuff is awesome!  Just a little bit goes a long way!  It left my hair feeling silky and shiny after the first use!  Love it!!</li>
            <li> I have terrible issues with my dry and flaky scalp.  I have tired every dandruff shampoo.  I have even tried medicated shampoos from my doctor.  nothing ever eliminated the problem.  saw this on amazon and emailed the company.  they were so nice and sent me a small sample bottle to try.  in three days, my scalp was clean and flake free!  This stuff is SERIOUS!!  I immediately ordered the full size as well as one of their shampoos and it has made such a difference.  I don&#x27;t feel self conscious in public anymore or worry that someone will point out the nasty flakes  in my hair!  if you have a problem like mine, u seriously should try this stuff.  I love it.</li>
            <li> I just got this conditioner and I absolutely love it. I was looking for a conditioner that would make my hair silky and soft for a long time. My hair is thin and very frizzy. And I found Maple Holistics Silk 18 conditioner is perfect. After applying it, my hair felt soft and less frizzy. I would highly recommend this conditioner</li>
            <li> I have been trying many natural conditioner choices lately and thought this one might be it since it had such great ratings. It wasn&#x27;t. I love the smell and I love the ingredient list but I don&#x27;t love how my hair feels during and after using it. For reference purposes, I have think, long, curly, easily frizzy hair. I have to use a ton of this stuff just to coat my hair (like an entire handful) and then it still doesn&#x27;t feel conditioned. I can barely get a comb through it. I wanted to love this, but the search continues...</li>
            <li> I really love this conditioner.  The warm vanilla smell is the best and I love that it is not filled with toxic chemicals.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ve tried argan oil, conditioning treatments, keratin, coconut oil, trying to find what this product gave me, from the fist time i used it i felt how my hair was with a better texture and felt exactly like silk!. this made my list of permanent use products,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m already losing hair and wanted to be cautious.. somehow when i apply this conditioner, i feel too much of hair fall during wash...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: i&#x27;ve been using Sage Shampoo but that works for me.</li>
            <li> The musky vanilla smell reminded me of that powdered deodorizer you sprinkle on your carpet before you vacuum, which to me is an awful smell! I couldn&#x27;t get past the smell, I had to wash it out....yuck.</li>
            <li> If you love vanilla you&#x27;ll love this product. Smells great and leaves my hair silky smooth!</li>
            <li> Just a quarter size and your hair is sooo soft.</li>
            <li> This is my second time buying this conditioner. I am in love with it!!!!! It leaves hair soft with no build up. Its all vegan and has no parabens,  which is important to me. I re ordered a third bottle to make sure I keep it in stock. Love, love, love! !!!</li>
            <li> This is the best conditioner we have ever used. All other conditioners have never performed as Silk18 does. Our hair literally feels like silk. As long as Silk18 is produced, we will buy it.</li>
            <li> Defines my curls, smells great, easy pump, great for transitioners/natural hair girls !! love it as a deep condition/leave in/regular condition/pre poo/everything!</li>
            <li> LoveThis prosuct tried it once and it made my hair so soft and healthy feeling without have the itchy thick conditioner scalp my hair felt clean for quite a few days and stayed soft.</li>
            <li> i just bought both the shampoo and conditioner so far it leaves my hair smooth,silky and shiny. I would recommend these products</li>
            <li> Best conditioner I have ever used ! I have a lot of thin colored treated fried hair that has been so hard to brush in the past . I no longer have that problem .I give a A+</li>
            <li> An ecellent prduci, but I did not rrceive a recipe book as advertised.</li>
            <li> Used this conditioner along with the Argan oil shampoo.. Very impressed with the results! My hair feels softer and somehow I feel in just 3 used the hair fall has decreased!</li>
            <li> Love, love this conditioner! It does wonders but doesn&#x27;t weigh down hair, a great product! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t love the fact that it had leaked all over the inside of the packaging.  Hope not much product was lost.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this conditioner so far! I only need to use a dime size amount and it completely coats my long hair with a emollient silky feel. This was exciting for me because I was concerned that the small size of the bottle would mean I had to purchase it quite often. But I actually end up using about 1/4 the amount of conditioner that i normally would.&lt;br /&gt;I am also happy with the natural ingredients, it is important to me to stay away from harsh detergents/SLS/parabens/synthetic fragrances in my skin/body care. That being said, this conditioner smells absolutely heavenly! It also keeps my hair static free during the dry winter months, which is why I wanted to this conditioner to begin with. I am a Maple Holistics loyal customer from now on!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for few time but already seen the improvements. My hair is much softer than before and it seems that the frequent loss of hair is coming to an end. However, the best part of using it is the smell it has, this is just surprisingly great, loved it.</li>
            <li> The most nourishing conditioner ever used! Will definitely buy again  :)</li>
            <li> I was actually very surprised with the results. My hair is naturally a very dark brown but I dye it very light blonde so I buy anything and everything that has good reviews but I am generally disappointed. Not this time. It leaves my hair very soft and manageable. It looks much healthier! I would definitely recommend this product to anybody with damaged hair.</li>
            <li> Recently bought this item to go along with Maple Holistics Hydrate Shampoo.  I was at first a little hesitant because the vanilla aroma in the bottle was quite strong, but once on my hair it toned down to a very gentle kind of aroma which was very nice.  I used the Hydrate Shampoo first and left it on my hair and scalp for 3 minutes as recommended, and then rinsed it clean.  The shampoo lathered well and rinsed away easily and my head felt totally fresh and clean, I then followed it with the Silk 18 Conditioner...left it in my hair for a few minutes and rinsed it out...again it rinsed out easily and my hair felt clean and was easy to comb.  After blow drying I could not help but notice how healthy and shiny may hair looked...it has a real swing to it now...and people have remarked on it.  I shall use this from now on, and highly recommend it. I have looked a long time for a good healthy shampoo and conditioner, this is most definitely the one I have been searching for.  My daughter is using the Tea Tree Shampoo from this range and will now use nothing else...her scalp has not been so healthy ever - and she is now a devoted user too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a great deep conditioning treatment, and this one definitely works for me. No need to go to the salon for keratin treatment!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best hair conditioner I&#x27;ve used. I can feel that my hair gets immediately very smooth after applying it. Also, I find I just need to use a very small amount each time as compared with other products.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair unbelievably soft and silky. I recommend this product for anyone who has dry, over processed hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product once so far but reviewed it thoroughly before purchasing and I am impressed! The pleasant smell, the consistency, and the silkiness of my hair after use is fantastic. I will definitely be trying more products by maple holistics.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! My hair is dry and damaged due to coloring and heat styling. This conditioner helps my hair feel silky and soft without weighing it down. It doesn&#x27;t make my scalp look greasy either. It has a nice, subtle smell.</li>
            <li> I have spent untold amounts of money over the years on hair conditioner. I have very fine, thinning, curly, unruly hair. I use sulfate free products and even sleep in a silk granny hat. My hair is horrible. I love this conditioner. My hair actually felt soft. One use. I do believe I even detected a little swing when I moved. I have high hopes that this will continue. Right now I am loving it and am looking forward to trying other products.</li>
            <li> I liked the conditioner, left hair feeling silky smooth. Only negative which is a personal opinion is the fragrance smell is a little too strong for me.</li>
            <li> This conditioner has been the best for us long haired girls (ages 5, 9 and 39).  Finally found one that works great with detangling and does not weight our hair down.  It works best when left on hair for about 5 min or more before rinsing.  My 9 yr old has received many compliments about how soft her hair is since using it on a regular basis.  She has thick course red hair and this conditioner has amazing results!  My hair is a mix of fine and course so it tends to frizz at the ends when styling- I use a very small dab of this as touch up ( no rinse) when blow drying and my frizz disappears!  A little bit goes a long way so 8 oz bottle lasts quite a while making it a good value!</li>
            <li> My hair has never felt better than when I started using this conditioner.  Other conditioners left my hair frizzy during the day and just not as shiny.  This conditioner is absolutely wonderful for my hair.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> This product is awesome!!!! I have very thick course hair.  I tried this conditioner and it made my hair manageable.  It added shine, deatangled, and hydrated my hair.  Wonderful product!</li>
            <li> Really good conditioner! It makes my hair quite soft, and not feeling greasy like some other conditioners might do. Smells very nice too, a clean vanilla smell. It is nice that not too much of it needs to be used each time so the bottle will last you quite a while. Just wish you could order a bigger sized bottle, or maybe have this one be a bit cheaper.</li>
            <li> It is a bit too sweet and didn&#x27;t really like the container.</li>
            <li> I also wrote a review for the argon oil shampoo, and I hated that as well. It&#x27;s worth noting I used this and the shampoo together twice and this by itself with Shea Moisture shampoo once, with the same results all three times: Gorgeous hair, but lots of lost hair in the shower and tons of shedding for days afterwards. It seems to works incredibly well, and I loved how soft my hair was and how it looked afterwards, but the hair loss horrified and disturbed me!!! I stopped using regular shampoo for that very reason, so it&#x27;s very disturbing to try a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; shampoo and conditioner that causes the same issue. So I returned it and my reason was that the product doesn&#x27;t line up with the description. I don&#x27;t believe this can be natural! I feel it damaged my hair. Another reason I dislike this product is the smell. It smells like candy. It&#x27;s sickeningly sweet. I didn&#x27;t notice any vanilla really, just a syrupy sweet smell that lingered FOREVER. Even if I had liked the smell to begin with I&#x27;m convinced the lingering of it would have made me hate it. So, YES, I agree with the other bad reviews. Hair loss and nasty lingering smell make this totally a waste of money to me! I&#x27;m going back to using Shea Moisture which stopped all hair loss for me (until I tried this CRAP! But thankfully after I stopped using this and returned to She Moisture I&#x27;m back to no hair loss in the shower or throughout the day) and works fine too. It&#x27;s also cheaper, at Walmart.</li>
            <li> My hair is very damaged.  It is 3b curly type hair (cuacasion hair that is very curly in some areas and wavy in other areas and tends to be frizzy).  I have colored and lightened and done way too much to my hair which tends to be very fragile to begin with.  However, when my hair is healthy and I take care of it, it is gorgeous.  My hair is very thick and full bodied and when I was younger I woulld recieve compliments on my hair all the time.  As I have gotten older and damaged my hair I have not recieved much in the way of compliments. Anyway... I am trying to get my hair back to its former glory.  I have been using Silk 18 for almost two weeks now and my hair feels so much healthier!  It looks so much better and I am loving it!  I went to my doctor the other day and she told me whatever I was doing was working, and asked me what I was using in my hair because my hair looked gorgeous.  I also received a compliment from a co-worker yesteday. She told me she loved my curly hair. Finally.... I am starting to get compliments again.  YAY.  I have been looking for something that is sulfate free and natural and healthy.  I have tried quite a few different products out there, but none of them seemed to really help my hair until now.  I am so glad I found Silk18!  The price is SOOOOO good and it does wonders for my hair.  Thank you for making such a great product.</li>
            <li> Been using this product regularly since I bought it.  Updated to 5 stars because we like it that much!  Nice to have a product that works this well without a bunch of chemical ingredients.</li>
            <li> Just tried this, along with the Maple Holistics Hydrate shampoo. I like both very much. I find I don&#x27;t need to use as much argan oil-based leave in conditioner as I did before. I&#x27;m over 50 and lately noticed my hair getting dryer and frizzier. (Aging - gotta love it!) Anyway, after only my second use, my girlfriend complimented me on my smooth shiny hair. Ok, to be fair, it was just cut and blown dry, but my hairstylist was impressed with my hair as well. In addition to the way this product makes my hair feel, I also like the idea that the product is gentle, and uses natural and sometimes organic ingredients.  Others dislike the strong vanilla smell, but I love it! You can tell it&#x27;s got lots of oil in it, but don&#x27;t worry, your hair will not end up a sticky oily mess. You don&#x27;t need to spend a fortune for great hair products.  Tip:  After shampooing, be sure you don&#x27;t wash out too much conditioner. Stop rinsing when your hair is still very slippery and smooth.</li>
            <li> like other conditioner</li>
            <li> Being a guy with wavy, &amp;#34;poofy&amp;#34; hair, I&#x27;ve always found it near impossible to find some kind of shampoo/conditioner that keeps my hair from drying out and becoming &amp;#34;poofier&amp;#34; as the day wares on. However, this conditioner has proven to be a big help, especially if left in. Give this stuff a shot!</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner! I have never used something that makes my hair feel so silky and soft! After about a week of using it my hair looked so much healthier. I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> I have only been using this conditioner for a few days and here is what is does and doesn&#x27;t do for my hair.  First, I have very fine curly hair that will frizz if I don&#x27;t use a conditioner and would be impossible to comb out after a shampoo.  I like the fact that this is a natural conditioner so that and all the positive reviews are what made me purchase it along with the argan shampoo.  The shampoo lathers up very nicely and has a nice scent to it, but after rinsing my hair it felt dry and brittle.  I put on the conditioner and left it in for a few minutes and my hair softened up a good bit, but it did not feel silky and it left me with lots of tangles to get out.  However, it wasn&#x27;t that hard to get out the knots, just a few extra minutes.  I let my hair dry naturally and it turned out really soft and light and shiny.  Lots of shampoos and conditioners leave my scalp itchy after a few uses, but these have not done that.  I will definitely buy this again!</li>
            <li> Smell is fantastic and goes great with the Maple Holistics Argan oil shampoo!</li>
            <li> This conditioner is AMAZING! I have very frizzy crazy curly hair. This conditioner was able to tame my mane. Once using the product in the shower within about a minute of leaving it in my hair was smooth I could nicely run my finger through my hair. I let it air dry without adding a drop of any other products and my curls were beautiful and frizz free. Along with the great benefits to my hair the product smells sooo good!!! This is now definitely my go to conditioner. The only thing I wish is that they would sell this product in a larger bottle option. That would be amazing! I highly recommend this product for anyone and especially my fellow curly girls!</li>
            <li> I decided that I did not want any chemicals in my personal beauty regime and set out to find a good conditioner. I was suffering from dry, frizzy hair and getting terrible knots in the back if I didn’t wash and condition every day. I came across Maple Holistics and decided to give it a try. After a month, I am very happy with the product. My hair is conditioned, not heavy, and looks so shiny.  It instantly detangles my hair in the shower and feels silky when wet. The smell is a pleasant vanilla and not overpowering and you only need to use a small amount of conditioner, as it is so concentrated. I will definitely keep using this product.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this conditioner!  I use it with the Maple Holistics Degrease shampoo.  It leaves my hair smelling great and feeling soft.  I just wish it gave my hair a little more body.  Also, the bottle is way too small, I have long hair, so it goes quickly.  Hopefully they will start making larger sizes so it doesn&#x27;t have to go so quickly &amp; it won&#x27;t be so expensive. However, I am very pleased with the conditioner overall &amp; will probably reorder.</li>
            <li> Prompt delivery.  Item as described.</li>
            <li> this is amazing, I did not like it at first actually, I felt like it did not do anything to my hair, but I dyed my hair last month and it became horribly dry, and when I used this omg you can see the difference right away it made my hair softer, smoother and more moist, I like it a lot, 4 stars for not showing any directions to use or even ingredients on the bottle</li>
            <li> The conditioner smells great and I love that it is holistic in nature, unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t help my hair at all. After 3 weeks of use, my hair still felt as dry as it did before.  My hair is very course and a bit damaged though, so it may work for you if your hair isn&#x27;t damaged at all.</li>
            <li> Love the product. Softens and conditions beautifully.</li>
            <li> I thought the conditioner really helped moisturize my dry scalp and relieve any itchiness. It made my hair very soft and shiny, as well. Detangling was a breeze and all I did was leave the conditioner on for 5 minutes in the shower. I would definitely recommend this conditioner, because it does what it says it will. Great product! The only thing I&#x27;m disappointed about is the fact that these don&#x27;t come in larger sized bottles.</li>
            <li> Hello there, I have sensitive scalp, curly hair, thin hair, my hair get very tangle, and it comes out easily, in only 2 weeks the I started  using the Argan Shampoo and Silk Conditioner, the first time I used my hair been so easy to deal with, strong,  thick, and so shine, few peoples ask me what I do to my hair, I told them I finally find my shampoo and conditioner, I&#x27;m so happy I took the chance to tray it, I recommend this products  to every one, it work for all  hair, Thank you so much  Maple Holistic, here is my Amazon purchased ID #1140173554-2268229 :)  22 Clenning Street, Nepean Ontario, K2J 5B2  Canada.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mayra Acosta.</li>
            <li> This really wonderful product. Like very light smell and doesn&#x27;t make hair artificially soft or chemicalized.</li>
            <li> Good product, but like some other reviews the fragrance is a bit strong on the vanilla side, but nothing that would make me Not buy the product. It does a nice job of hydrating my curly hair and actually makes my curls soft and defined which is awesome especially in the humid months.</li>
            <li> This conditioner smells great!! It leaves my hair soft and silky. Love this product. Definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s start with some background. I&#x27;m a young man with thick, coarse black hair past shoulder-length. I look at my dad&#x27;s side of the family and see a history of unfortunate genetics in the form of baldness. That&#x27;s pretty worrisome, but thankfully the hairline isn&#x27;t receding yet. After some pro-active research, I decided to buy the Silk 18 natural conditioner along with Pura d&#x27;or Hair Loss Prevention shampoo. The shampoo has a strong medicinal smell, and I&#x27;m telling you this because this Silk 18 conditioner has a strong, masking vanilla scent. My hair kind of smells like spiced vanilla or root beer, which I like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Natural and sulfate-free.&lt;br /&gt;- Definitely silky smooth consistency.&lt;br /&gt;- Strong vanilla scent. It isn&#x27;t really subtle despite what some people say, so make sure you like vanilla before buying this.&lt;br /&gt;- Very light feeling on hair with no residue. I also noticed unlike with typical commercial conditioners, there isn&#x27;t any gunk build-up in the shower drain.&lt;br /&gt;- No dandruff, scalp feels clean and not itchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con (just one):&lt;br /&gt;- Only 8 ounces. I have a ton of hair so this is going to go fast. I wish Maple Holistics made a 16 oz. bottle, with a pump dispenser. That would be a dream come true.</li>
            <li> It smells so good. I got it yesterday, I tried it and my head feels wonderful.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product. This product could not have come at a better time. FYI this is for every ethnicity!!! I am natural and recently straightened my hair and acquired quite a bit of heat damage (so horrified :( ) but using this product, is strengthening my hair up and the amino acids in the conditioner is helping my curl pattern come back. I actually use this as a deep conditioner and again am very pleased with this product. I wish there was a larger bottle because I will be needing another  bottle soon. So far it is halfway gone and I have had about four uses out of it.</li>
            <li> i can feel my hair so smooth already!!! Its really not the same! My hair are healthy now!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Sage shampoo which I love but it&#x27;s a bit drying for me so I tried this and love it.  My hair is softer and less frizzy.</li>
            <li> I actually was looking for a leave in conditioner when I found this and thought I&#x27;d give it a try. I LOVE IT! The fragrance is soft and pleasant and my hair feels like silk when I&#x27;m done. And I have used a little on the ends as a leave in. It doesn&#x27;t leave any greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> My 8 month old was born with a head full of long hair that I needed to start conditioning when she was a newborn. This is gentle and smells great and the only thing I trust on her sweet little head.</li>
            <li> This product left my hair silky soft, and got my waves under control. I also noticed that my ends are a lot less dry and not splitting. I love that it does not weigh your hair down and it leaves a very pleasant light vanilla scent. I definitely recommend it for all types of hair!</li>
            <li> This is the best conditioner that I have used in a long time.  It makes your hair very soft and smells very good.  I love it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this conditioner! My hair is so soft after using and the smell is amazing!</li>
            <li> My hair feels amazing after using, and I love the scent.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is the best I ever used. It makes my hair soft and shiny for days. I really  like the smell. Will surely buy this conditioner again!</li>
            <li> i love it. smell is so good</li>
            <li> I found this product on Amazon while searching for a really good conditioner for dry hair.  I have naturally curly, course, dry hair that has been lightened...leading to more dryness.  I started using the product a little over a month ago.  I only shampoo a few times a week - at most - and use the product each time.  I have been leaving it in for about 10 minutes and then rinsing with tepid water.  First of all, I LOVE the smell of this product.  Second, it really works!  My hair is back to being very healthy and I am absolutely thrilled.  My biggest criticism would be that the bottle it comes in is really horrible to try and squeeze.  The company should change the bottle or perhaps put a pump on it instead.  No other complaints.  Great stuff!</li>
            <li> I ordered this conditioner along with Maple Holistic&#x27;s Argan Oil Shampoo at the same time. The shampoo works fine but nothing to rave about in my honest opinion, but I love love love this conditioner! It costs a little more than what I usually spend on hair products, but I think it is absolutely worth it. My damaged, dry, frizzy hair comes out soft and shiny after drying. Wish I knew of this product sooner. I&#x27;ve been using the Organix shampoo and conditioner for the past few years, but MH conditioner will be my go-to now.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner made my hair so soft! I love it and will go back for more! I have curly coarse hair and I have tried everything! This is great I really love that it made my coarse hair soft! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  I dye my hair light blonde so it dries out easily.  This makes it feel soft and silky again.  I tried using a different shampoo and conditioner for a while and my hair feels like straw, going back to Maple Holistics!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I try this brand and I&#x27;m very satisfied. The conditioner leaves the hair silk-soft and smelling good. Lately I&#x27;ve been bleaching my hair and it was dry and all frizzy. It improved a lot after using this product.</li>
            <li> very good product. it made my hair a lot smoother and shinier.</li>
            <li> Lovely vanilla smell that lightly lingers on dry hair. Leaves my hair soft and manageable. This is my second purchase and I will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> I have really coarse, dry, chemically straightened hair, and this conditioner works really well. It gives my hair a healthier look, and my hair feels softer after the first use.  Plus it smells wonderful. It&#x27;s a bit pricy for the amount you get, and that&#x27;s the reason for a four-star rating. Otherwise, five stars</li>
            <li> For My Daughter.  Used in conjunction with Tea Tree Oil Shampoo for Moderate Dandruff with Organic Lavender &amp; Rosemary.  Can&#x27;t say enough good stuff about these products.  Can change drastically damaged hair into soft, shiny hair with body and lovely texture.  Thank you</li>
            <li> Great light conditioner. It does the job without weighing my already fine, straight hair totally lifeless. I am VERY PLEASED and will definitely purchase again. Thank you  !</li>
            <li> Well to be honest I have used it once! I have what seems like 3a type curls.. about armpit length.. and my hair has low porosity,.. and medium thin... Anyways I have used a lot of heat styling to it.. mostly blow drying.. and its just easier, and nicer for me to wear my curls then to just straighten It all the time.&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for a conditioner that was sulfate, and silicone free.. And this one has that pluse amino acids, plus good oils. keratin,what seems like aloe juice, and a bunch of other good ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;I may update if im not satisfied with it..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gotta say I also bought a sulfate free shampoo.. Renpure Cononut milk nourishing shampoo 16 fl oz at TJ Maxx for $6.99 so I also started using that one cause its got good ingredients and sulfate, sodium chloride, dyes, harsh salts, parabens and gluten free... sooo&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;after the shower I left a lil of this conditioner on. just because I have dry hair.. rinsed with coldest water possible.. for frizz,.. and then blow dried with cool air. for volume.. and still a lil dull (but not as with using sulfate, and silicone products) so added a lil coconut oil to my dry curls only .. now my hair is a lil too oily for my taste.. but its because my scalp is over producing oil cause its used to much lather in shampoos and conditioners.. so I just have to wait a few showers for my hair and scalp to get used to it..</li>
            <li> I have naturally very thick, coarse hair and have trouble getting product completely gone! I also take an hour to blow dry after air drying. Managing my long, thick hair can be overwhelming at times especially when I would like for it to be soft and pretty! I have only used Maple Holistics Argan Shampoo and Silk 18 Conditioner and already feel transformed! Not only does it smell amazing, my hair looks shinier, feels softer, and didn’t take as long to dry. It feels overall healthier which is great!</li>
            <li> This is honestly the best conditioner I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long, naturally wavy, rather difficult hair.  I was using a conventional salon brand because I couldn&#x27;t find a natural conditioner that would work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found Silk 18 a few months ago.  A little goes a long way, it takes out the tangles, and my hair is smooth as it gets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my new favorite!</li>
            <li> This literally transformed my hair after only one use, love this product and will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> After searching quite a while for a Natural Conditioner that actually works I&#x27;m so happy to have found this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is left tangle free, shinny, and healthy!  It rinses clean unlike other natural conditioner&#x27;s I&#x27;ve tried that leave a strange oily residue.  This one seems to be the perfect balance!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only criticism is that my hair is left smelling a bit like a sugar cookie with the strong Vanilla scent.  (The only reason for the 4 stars instead of 5) Perhaps this could be toned down a bit?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very excited to try out all of the other Maple Holistics products!</li>
            <li> I love love love this!!! My hair finally stopped shedding and its once again healthy.</li>
            <li> I am African American,  I did the big chop and only used natural products on my hair and this product works perfect on my hair..Buy it natural sisters ASAP. You don&#x27;t even need conditioner, feels like a cowash</li>
            <li> I had a friend who bought this and wasn&#x27;t crazy about it. I however, would try anything. My hair was damaged over a month time span due to over processing. I tried my deep conditioner that I use normally, a salon brand deep conditioner, my normal conditioner, I even tried the eggs and mayo remedy. Nothing worked until I tried this. My fried hair now was soft and silky again. I would buy this for myself.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product!  I use it as my once a week deep conditioner..i was bleaching my hair a lot so it was very dry and brittle. My hair dresser recommended this and it has done wonders for my hair. I would definitely recommend</li>
            <li> This is amazing conditioner and it smells great! My hair is long and was very dry when my friend gave me some to try.. I&#x27;m now on my second bottle, my hair is silky and soft! I have a lot less breakage too!</li>
            <li> With the winter months drying out my hair, this product is perfect. It smells like vanilla, and you can leave it on your hair for a few minutes while you shave, and your hair comes out silky smooth!</li>
            <li> This product is great. It&#x27;s free from harsh chemicals AND leaves my long hair soft and silky. I will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> Its a good product .Hope it worked good for my long ,thick,black hair</li>
            <li> I love Maple Holistics&lt;br /&gt;I use this treatment on my very dry coarse hair I wrap my hair with a shower cap And massage the maple holistic conditioner all over my scalp.. Its very soothing and it has the subtle with a hint of vanilla scent.&lt;br /&gt;leaving my hair Silky and oh it did worked on my frizzy dry damaged hair It gave my hair A body and volumized texture leaving it looking healthy! And I like it that its Sulfate free Its works wonders for me</li>
            <li> I use this product with the Argan oil shampoo and they both work wonders on my hair. I have over processed hair that fell out a lot. With the two,my hair falls a lot less and within the first week I noticed the immediate change in the texture and look of my hair. My hair is naturally wavy but because I bleached my hair, it became very damaged, dry, and unmanageable. I feel like leaving in the conditioner to sit in my hair works really well and hair feels as soft as it has ever been. My whole family wants to know my hair care routine because of how different my hair looks.</li>
            <li> I gave Silk 18 to my daughter and my niece recently as gifts. Both young ladies were delighted with the results, so I ordered a bottle for myself. This conditioner is among the best I have used. Hair is radiant, soft, and in control for days. Silk 18 has a great, subtle aroma. The thing I like most is how easily it rinses out... far quicker than other products in this price range, which is high. The results justify the cost if you care about your hair. Good stuff. Company seems cool, too.</li>
            <li> Juat love the Silk 18th Conditioner it has helped my hair so much.</li>
            <li> Eh. Not impressed. Smell was ok. That was probably the best thing about it. Very waxy and really leaves a heavy coat if you don&#x27;t use a clarifying shampoo in between uses. Wouldn&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> This may be the best conditioning product I have ever used. I have long, very fine blonde hair with a natural wave. I can use this product very sparingly, but it de-tangles my hair, conditions and protects it, without weighing it down or leaving a nasty buildup. I can even use this conditioner on my roots, which I normally don&#x27;t do, as it isn&#x27;t heavy and rinses very clean, even in my softened well water. Then I can let my hair air dry wavy, or I can blowdry it straight, and it looks smooth, shiny, full, and doesn&#x27;t frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most conditioners don&#x27;t work on fine hair, especially those designed for fine hair, because they try to thicken the hair rather than simply smooth it. This conditioner is super light, but still keeps my hair looking and feeling great. It&#x27;s perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that all of these products are economical, and a little seems to go a very long way. Also, made in the USA!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think a conditioner could ever be any better than this Silk 18! It is truly amazing! You really only need just a dab and massage it in for a minute or two. I just love this company! They truly care about their products and customers.</li>
            <li> Me and my daughter both just used this conditioner, and its awesome. We both absolutely love this stuff already!!! Oh yeah, my daughter is only 6 and asked me if she can use it every day lol. Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is extremely moisturizing and has a rich vanilla scent, which my husband likes. My hair doesn&#x27;t seem to accept moisture well regardless of what I use on it, but this at least gave it good slip and detangled well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One downside - I broke out horribly with back acne after using this a couple times. I have very acne prone skin so I have to treat it like a delicate science experiment and it did not react well to this luscious product. Bummer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your hair is dry, you&#x27;ll probably love this. It&#x27;s all natural, too, which is AWESOME!</li>
            <li> Great product.&lt;br /&gt;Great service&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner! I have very fine and often tangled long hair. I bought this product soley based on a blog review I saw about it And I&#x27;m so happy that I did! My hair feels fuller, softer and smells great! I have also noticed a brush goes through it more easily now. I will definitely be repurchasing when this bottle runs out, and planning on getting some of the pairing shampoo once my current bottle runs out! Highly recommended, especially to the ladies with fine hair!</li>
            <li> Excellent conditioner!</li>
            <li> Product worked some on my frizzy hair.  Will not be buying again.</li>
            <li> Smells so awesome after the 2nd or 3rd time of use I could tell my hair is much much softer!</li>
            <li> This stuff works great!! I can&#x27;t wait to buy some shampoo next! My hair after the first use was really soft feeling, even after blow drying it.  Still very soft, I am in love with this product now, plus it didn&#x27;t bother my sensitive hands.  I will have to say after trying so many different organic and natural brands, I think this one is my most favorite!</li>
            <li> I considered chopping off my hair because it had become dry, lifeless, fragile and brittle. Today, I received the argon oil shampoo and silk 18 conditioner. Additionally, I used the HSI heat protectant. Can you say &#x27;thoroughly impressed&#x27;!&lt;br /&gt;Immediately, my hair felt silky and was tangle-free. Before, I combed thru my hair slowly, petrified after seeing with each pass strands of frayed hair in the comb. The combination of these products have been a hair-savior. I can&#x27;t wait to show-off my hair!</li>
            <li> This conditioner made my hair feel so soft!</li>
            <li> I purchased this conditioner in addition to the degrease shampoo by Maple Holistics and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. My hair has always been extremely greasy. Even if I would wash my hair each morning, my hair would look as if I hadn&#x27;t showered in days. The degrease shampoo has gotten rid of all of the build up and I love applying the Silk 18 as my follow up conditioner. It makes my hair manageable to brush right out of the shower and leaves it feeling smooth and light, without adding any build up back into my hair. I am very satisfied with this product and will continue to purchase in the future.</li>
            <li> Received my silk 18 conditioner and was pleasantly satisfied, smooths my frizzy ends, leaves my natural hair very soft &amp; moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;Love the vanilla frangence. My new fav..so glad I ordered</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this conditioner! It leaves my hair extremely manageable and soft. I have thick, curly hair that tends to get dry but this product is amazing for nourishing it. I usually use it as leave in conditioner and it surprisingly is not greasy. Even the day after my hair looks hydrated but not greasy unlike other products I have used in the past. I definitely recommend it for either regular conditioner or leave in conditioner (for thicker, curlier hair). You also can&#x27;t beat the fact that it is 100% natural and under $15!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product, and works great on by 3A/3B curly hair. I tried the DevaCurl method and it was not for me.  After reading the reviews, I decided to give this product a try.  I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the product and how it works on my hair.  It leaves it soft, manageable, and smelling great.  It is also light and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy.  The only down side is that II wish they made a bigger bottle with a pump.</li>
            <li> This shampoo smells great almost edible, however the amount I had to use just to feel the softness made me return my bottle. It is pricey for the amount of ounces in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Nice conditioner with a nice scent.</li>
            <li> THIS CONDITIONER IS AMAZING. It smells great and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue. I highly recommend</li>
            <li> I am shocked that a natural product would work so well. I have used other natural brands before but I have been unimpressed. This conditioner packs a punch. I usually use coconut oil at the bottom of my long hair to help with the dryness...I don&#x27;t have to do that when I use this amazing conditioner. Also the price is so reasonable for the quality.</li>
            <li> This is my new daily shampoo. I can&#x27;t believe I wasted so much money on expensive, products when the results weren&#x27;t that much better. Not only does it smell amazing, but it also makes my hair very soft and full of life.</li>
            <li> this conditioner made my fine thin curly hair feel like burlap rope.  used is 3 times.  no thanks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a beach girl with a very low maintenance hair routine (read: neglecting my hair). It&#x27;s under the hot sun a lot and exposed to salty harsh ocean water as well as chlorine. I also don&#x27;t cut it nearly often enough. Well, as a result, I recently noticed just how brittle, damaged (split-ends, dryness) my hair has become over the last few months, and decided that I wanted to go the all natural route to begin to heal my hair. I have gone through the baking soda and apple cider vinegar phase, but it didn&#x27;t work well enough for me so back to the chemical shampoo crap I went. Well, after learning more about the type of chemicals that are lurking in our products and doing thorough research on various products on Environmental Working Group&#x27;s site - including line by line on this product - I decided that I would take the plunge on this company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I paired this conditioner after the Argan Oil shampoo (which also worked beautifully by the way), and thoroughly brushed it through my long longs and waited at least a few minutes before showering. The vanilla scent is absolutely heavenly--strong but not cloying-- and still lingers in a faint way a few days later. More importantly, my soft, shiny and smooth locks have lingered too! After just one wash, they already feel softer, healthier and shinier. I have great hopes! Love this product, and the honest and great practices of the company. I&#x27;m totally sold!</li>
            <li> I got this and tried it a few times so far. I love how silky it makes my hair in the shower. The only reason I give it 4 stars is because my hair doesn&#x27;t feel quite as soft after it dries, however, that could very well simply be attributed to my fine, blond hair that seems to get a dry and tangled no matter how wonderful the product is! Will continue to use and see how it improves the condition of my hair. Worth giving a shot though, as it seems to make your hair manageable without putting a bunch of fake chemicals into it and definitely works better than cheap conditioners.</li>
            <li> Based on my experience with this conditioner, I would reccomend it to anyone who wants a safe and natural option to protect their hair. The vanilla scent is very pleasant and is not too strong after you rinse it off. During and after the usage of this conditioner, your hair will feel silky. The only downside of this product is its size.</li>
            <li> Great product for color-treated/highlighted hair at a great price.  Leaves hair very soft.  One plus I noticed is that even though we&#x27;re having really humid weather right now where I live, my hair didn&#x27;t pouf up like it usually does.  The only downside is the scent, it&#x27;s more musk-like than vanilla.  It didn&#x27;t seem to linger, however, once my hair was completely dry.  Next time will try the Maple Holistics Argan Oil conditioner which has no scent.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughters&#x27; very curly hair. They both really like it. The smell is excellent, and it is luxuriously moisturizing. I like that it is natural.</li>
            <li> Really helps moisturize my hair which is getting dry as it grays.  Just rinse out lightly as it doesn&#x27;t really weigh hair down.</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing conditioner, my hair is silky smooth.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t soften my hair. I know it is organic , but what good it is if it doesn&#x27;t soften the hair. I&#x27;ll use it until I finish the bottle but wouldn&#x27;t buy it again. When I use this product, I have to use more conditioning products  to soften my hair before blow drying.</li>
            <li> I have used a lot of different types of conditioner and this is honestly among the top. I have bleached my hair, had perms done, and a lot of heat damage, but this stuff brings my super long asian hair back to life. My one critique is that the bottle I received it in was really difficult to get the product out. It&#x27;s not a typical &amp;#34;squeeze&amp;#34; bottle -- more of a hard plastic that I need to thrust into my hand and hope that a lot of product doesn&#x27;t get wasted as it shoots unpredictably out of the bottle. (Think glass ketchup bottle status). Overall the product itself is great, I can see why so many people have rated it highly and that is one of the reasons I decided to try it in the first place. Would highly recommend this one if you&#x27;re trying to salvage your existing hair instead of just cutting it off! Wish it came in a bigger size!</li>
            <li> It is good. I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> This product has made my hair go from dry and unmanageable to silky and easy to style!! I absolutely love this product and plan to keep buying from maple holistics for ever!!!!</li>
            <li> This conditioner made de-tangling very easy after shampoo.  It has a great smell and definitely will be a part of my hair care regimen going forward.</li>
            <li> This stuff works wonders for my 2 year olds hair..it leave his curls manageable and moistureized.</li>
            <li> What is up with this tiny little bottle.&lt;br /&gt;Maple Holistics Hello.... Can you make this a lot BIGGER.&lt;br /&gt;Industrial size is welcome, LOL&lt;br /&gt;LOVE LOVE LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> Absolutely great conditioner. I have dermatitis issues and as a result, have trouble finding a conditioner that doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair and make it overly greasy. This conditioner keeps my hair soft and supple without being overly greasy. I use a very small amount and it conditions my hair thoroughly with a light vanilla scent that lasts. I was concerned at first, as my hair seemed knotty upon drying, but my comb glided easily through with no tugging. Overall, I am very pleased with this conditioner :)</li>
            <li> Highly recommended! This is excellent and my wife is very happy with this conditioner. Most of the ingredients are natural and best part is that these are sulfite free!</li>
            <li> This def is great conditioner. It smells like vanilla! It really softens crunchy hair.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is fabulous. I am always looking for the most natural yet effective product for my dry hair and this is it. After shampooing I applied it and left it on for probably 2-3 minutes. I have long hair so I also tied it up with an elastic so it wouldn&#x27;t get washed out before I was ready. After rinsing I could already feel a difference. Per the included usage tips i made sure to use the conditioner everywhere, not just the ends of my hair. Typically I will only use a conditioner on the ends because it leaves my scalp area greasy looking immediately- not this stuff! I also turned the temperature of the water down in the shower as recommended, hair likes cooler water. I let my hair air dry and what a huge difference from other conditioners. I feel like I moisturized my hair with out making it heavy or greasy- for once!! Plus it&#x27;s a safe and natural product I feel good about using. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because my daughters hair seems to get tangles. This is the only product that eliminates them! It makes her hair so soft and healthy without residue. I would recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li> I was sent a sample after calling the company with some questions about which products they would recommend for me. This conditioner truly feels like silk and makes my hair soft and detangled. It is not too heavy. I love that it doesn&#x27;t contain harmful ingredients which is my main motivation for using it. The vanilla smell is great too.</li>
            <li> My family and I started using Maple Holistics Argan Shampoo and Silk 18 Conditioner about 5 months ago.  This conditioner is AWESOME!!! My daughter has medium long hair and I had used many different conditioners and detangling products on her hair prior to Silk 18.  None of them really worked well.  Those of you who have battled the tangles of childhood hair can understand the frustration.  I started using this on my daughter hair, along with a wet brush, and it brushes through beautifully.  No more tangles!  Plus it has a wonderful scent.</li>
            <li> I had used the same conditioner for a few years and was looking for a change. I&#x27;m very particular about what products I use on my hair so I had researched a lot before zeroing down to this product and one other product. After using this for the very first time, I noticed a major difference in my hair texture. It had become more manageable and frizz had reduced considerably. My only qualm is that it is a small bottle for the price.</li>
            <li> I bought this product about 3 weeks ago and I use it once a week. I absolutely love love love how soft this makes my hair feel. I leave it on as a deep conditioner for about 20-30 minutes with a shower cap. Making sure that I rinse real well and boom, soft shiny and silky hair. It&#x27;s amazing that this condition contains all natural oils and gentle for your hair and scalp. I definitely will be buying this product again once I run out!</li>
            <li> My hair got so silky that now it&#x27;s kind of hard to control them! It&#x27;s a funny problem to have :)) I love the result. These last months I keep traveling between two different climates: one is very hot and very humid, the other one is extremely dry, cool and windy. My hair didn&#x27;t understand that and got dull and split.&lt;br /&gt;Now it&#x27;s better again.&lt;br /&gt;Today I also ordered a shampoo by the same company, let&#x27;s see if it saves the situation.</li>
            <li> This makes my hair smooth and not as frizzy. it helps with manageability. I use it daily.</li>
            <li> Four star for the ingredients, probably about 3 starts for product itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really wanted to love this, since the ingredients are great and I&#x27;m still looking for a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; shampoo conditioner that I really like.  I do ok with making my own shampoo but I can&#x27;t get a conditioner down that doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down, and I&#x27;m afraid no company I&#x27;ve found can, either.  It has to be the coconut oil, which is one of the common ingredients in all that I&#x27;ve tried.  I have very fine, wavy hair so this conditioner may do better on coarser hair or even no straight hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Someone on another review mentioned price and I agree that it&#x27;s pricey at the &amp;#34;full&amp;#34; price.  If you diy you know that beauty/skin care ingredients - depending on what they are - are actually quite cheap and that only a little is used in a product.  This, for instance, is mostly coconut oil and water, with shea butter and a few other oils.  Honestly, if you&#x27;re paying a ton for any beauty product, you&#x27;re wasting your money.</li>
            <li> Made my hair feel heavy.</li>
            <li> I really love ALL of the Maple Holistics shampoo&#x27;s and conditioners. My boyfriend and I tried this one out because we were looking for something that felt really great for our hair and this is definitely it! When I use these hair products I really feel like I am doing my hair a favor.</li>
            <li> I really do not believe this is silicone free and &amp;#34;all natural.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very very excited to try this conditioner due to my history of nasty reactions to most drug store type everyday hair care items.  While researching paraben and silicone free shampoo, this product kept popping up and seemed to have great reviews.&lt;br /&gt;I sadly, will not be one of them. I have searched high and low, and I WANT to find that great product that doesn&#x27;t cause me harm... I really do. :[&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After letting this conditioner sit in my hair for about 20 mins, i was impressed with how soft and silky it made my hair feel even while rinsing.  But within the next few hours and overnight, I had large red welts and a rash around my jawline, chin and next to my ears. I have read the ingredients over and over and really do not know how or why this happens. i just know that I will not be buying it again. I liked how it made my hair feel, but having a quick reaction usually means something is in this that may not be pointed out. :[&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also don&#x27;t like being asked to review this positively to receive free items. :\&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**************Edited!!***********&lt;br /&gt;Changed from 3 stars to 1 star based on the &amp;#34;money back guarantee&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;I wrote to Maple Holistics asking them about the ingredients and telling them of my experience and was never contacted. I have tried 3 times to speak with someone to discuss this and... well here I am. I&#x27;m not happy that they advertise &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;guaranteed&amp;#34; and can&#x27;t back up either.  Will not be buying anything from this line again.</li>
            <li> This conditioner has a lovely scent to it, and it left my hair feeling healthy. Days after my hair has not been dry or brittle. I have yet to try the Shampoo, but will post a review on that after I have used it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few days now and I like it better than my H&amp;S conditioner. Great feel and aroma.</li>
            <li> I really love the smell. I also noticed a big difference in how soft my hair was after using this conditioner and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty picky about my hair products, so this stuff is really knocking it out of the ballpark for me. After switching to having more natural beauty products. I was afarid I would be loosing quality, but this is actually better than anything I&#x27;ve tried before. I have pretty thick wavy hair, and this does a great job at keeping it soft, and not too frizzy. I love keeping a tiny little bit in my hair after rinsing for soft hair all day long. Also, the vanilla scent is amazing! Can&#x27;t wait to try the shampoo next.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing conditioner! I&#x27;m so sold on this whole line because they use natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> The conditioner is great. For the first time in a long while my curls are under control. Thank you! I also very much appreciate your natural approach. I use essential oils for cleaning, instead of over-the-counter medications and in my massage business,-it&#x27;s nice to find a product that&#x27;s up to my high standard for natural purity and as a bonus was worked like a charm to tame my curly mane!</li>
            <li> I like the smell of it and the softness of my hair after using it.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST conditioner I&#x27;ve ever owned! Even while applying it, I could tell my hair was getting soft, which is naturally thick and coarse. I used it with Totlogic 2 in 1 shampoo and body wash and in my entire life, my hair has never been this soft! Ordered another 2 bottles right away!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like its fragrance</li>
            <li> The ingredients appear to be ones that would dry out your hair. And that&#x27;s exactly what it did. My hair is even dryer now. I like the IDEA of what this company says they want to do here, which is to create a natural healthy conditioner. However, they&#x27;re not there yet. I wish I could get my money back.</li>
            <li> feels great, good product, will buy again!</li>
            <li> Really helps detangle my hair.  Already ordered 4 items in the last 3 weeks.  Will continue to buy this wonderful product!</li>
            <li> Silk 18 is a great conditioner with lots of slip.  I love the vanilla scent! It leaves my hair feeling soft and silky.  I can feel my hair react to the conditioner as soon as I put it on in the shower.  I don&#x27;t need to use handfuls of it - a little goes a long way.  I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the shampoo I am using or the conditioner, but I have some trouble getting my hair to hold a style.  Otherwise, I would have given it five stars.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything as it promise.</li>
            <li> It does fantastic things for my fine, frizzy, curly hair. It felt soft and smooth even after the first use. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is that I hate the smell. I will continue to use it, but I will be on the lookout for the same product without the overpowering vanilla scent.</li>
            <li> I have very dry hair and scalp. This is THE BEST conditioner I have ever tried.  I use it in conjunction with their Hydrate shampoo.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner. It makes my hair feel super soft and silky. I use it with the tea tree oil shampoo. Great combo!</li>
            <li> The first time I tried this conditioner, I did not like it. It&#x27;s not moisturizing enough for the ends and my hair gets all tangled up because of it. The seller immediately issued me a refund and let me keep the bottle. I kept on using the conditioner and realized that it&#x27;s actually very moisturizing for my scalp and doesn&#x27;t make my scalp greasy or weigh down my hair afterwards (when used with the Sage shampoo, which can make my scalp very dry).</li>
            <li> Hair feels soft and silky after use and it is natural. Nice product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good natural product. It&#x27;s great for straight hair, but didn&#x27;t work well enough for us in the long run on my husband&#x27;s curly hair (whose problem with his unmanageable curly hair is the reason behind why we bought this product).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros - It smells GREAT! I love the warm vanilla sugar smell that lasts all day! It&#x27;s hydrating and lightweight enough for straight hair without being too oily. The ingredients are awesome. The price is reasonable for a natural conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons - You need to use a lot of product in order to completely cover your hair. My husband has curly hair and didn&#x27;t find this to be hydrating enough for him without using like a tenth of the bottle, and even then, found that he needed to rely heavily on a leave-in product in order for his curls to be hydrated enough.</li>
            <li> I have purchase Silk 18 twice now and am very pleased with the results. I am very picky with my conditioner. I need something thick feeling so I know it will help my dry tangled hair. I love the smell! I can comb my hair easily when I get out of the shower. I go to an Aveda salon to get my hair done. My stylist tells me that my hair is extremely healthy and that the products I am using in my hair are working well. I am happy that I have found a product that is affordable, natural and works.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to try this conditioner, based on all the great reviews, but also a little skeptical.  I have very thin, shoulder-length, naturally slightly-wavy hair that frizzes up if you look at it wrong.  I have tried so many products.  A lot of the products for curls just end up weighing down the hair on top of my head, so that it is straight while the sides are curly.  Any anti-frizz products just make it greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this conditioner for 3 days now, and am thrilled.  Usually, if I don&#x27;t put some sort of post-shower product in my hair, it will frizz.  After using this conditioner, I let my hair air-dry, as I normally do in summer, and it curled up nicely all over, with no frizz!  I really couldn&#x27;t believe it.  It worked even better when I made sure just to apply the conditioner to the ends of my hair and not the scalp.  I don&#x27;t have a lot of hair, so I only needed about a dime-sized drop, which I rubbed on my hands then smoothed through my hair until it was coated.  I let it sit in my hair for another 10 minutes or so while I completed my shower, then rinsed it out.  After the shower, I lightly wrapped my hair in a jersey-knit t-shirt until it was a little less damp, then air dried it the rest of the way.  The difference was dramatic; I was very impressed.  The conditioner smells amazing as well.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. I usually write reviews on Amazon, so I know what a 5 star product is. And I can&#x27;t give this product anything less!!! It makes my hair look great. I was initially very scared of using anything homeopathic. But this conditioner is just something else. I really, truly enjoy the product and plan to purchase the shampoo counterpart.</li>
            <li> For a conditioner that doesn&#x27;t cause cancer, this is pretty fantastic. All of the ingredients are actually something that I recognize.&lt;br /&gt;It leaves my hair feeling really silky and smooth, much nicer than any natural conditioner I&#x27;ve tried before. I have fine hair that is wavy, and I usually use conditioner from 100 percent pure, but now I&#x27;ve been alternating between this and that because this conditioner does things for my hair that other conditioners do not. It really tames frizz and makes my hair so soft and silky. Also, it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair overly oily or anything, I can go without washing my hair for several days and it still looks and feels nice.&lt;br /&gt;The price is not bad either, for a conditioner that has decent ingredients. I have paid more for conditioner that didn&#x27;t work as well. This is a great conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that the vanilla fragrance is a little strong, but after a day it fades away. Vanilla is not my favorite scent, so while this is a negative imo, it might be a plus to others.</li>
            <li> OMG this is the BEST ... I have previously been using Beautiful Lengths conditioner but this far out weighs that.  Thank you, Maple Holistics..&lt;br /&gt;My naturally curly hair gets a lot of damage from highlights and I live in Florida right now..a lot of humidity..this conditioner keeps my hair so soft.. I applied a small amount and tapped it on top of my head (I have long hair) and then ran just enough cool water over that .. it spread like wild fire through my hair..didn&#x27;t rinse it all out..so nice!!!  I will purchase more.</li>
            <li> I bought this conditioner because I loved that all the ingredients have a low rating on skin deep, and my all natural shampoo was leaving ym hair very dry.  I have been using this conditioner for over a month now and it is perfect.  It has a deep warm vanilla smell and leaves my hair feeling very soft and natural.  I have very fine but frizzy hair and this conditioner provides just the right amount of weight to my hair to prevent crazy frizz, while still staying soft but not oily looking.  Will definitely be buying this regularly.</li>
            <li> I bought this along with the shampoo for itchy scalp, and have been using it for about a month. The shampoo is great and I am so glad I bought it, but this conditioner does nothing for my hair. It&#x27;s not moisturizing at all. I used it after the shampoo and use a comb to evenly distribute through my hair and leave it in while I wash my body before rinsing but my hair still feels dry afterwards.</li>
            <li> I have been trying a lot of natural products lately including As I Am Cowash and Trader Joe hair products. This by far has left my hair in an amazing condition and I love how it&#x27;s all natural</li>
            <li> I have fine, mature hair that is curly and frizzy. I&#x27;ve recently found that a brazilian blowout works well for making my hair look shiny and revitalized but am unhappy with the damage that comes with chemically treating my hair. I tried the Silk 18 Natural Conditioner and it&#x27;s done wonders to extending the life of my blowout without weighing down my hair. It leaves my hair shiny and manageable and doesn&#x27;t make it flat or oily looking. I can also go several without rewashing using this product. I&#x27;m curious to see how it handles my curls after my blowout wears off. I&#x27;ll definitely buy this product again and plan to try other products from Maple Holistics.</li>
            <li> i justl love love love this product! my hair is beautiful now!</li>
            <li> Nothing special.. I was not impressed when I used this conditioner. My hair is still dry and frizzy after using this product.</li>
            <li> I am so happy I found this product!, I was not disappointed and the conditioner is awesome !!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Silk 18 Natural Conditioner seems to be keeping my hair more and more manageable , less frizzy, and softer ! Smells great !!&lt;br /&gt;I really recommended</li>
            <li> This conditioner  is gentle and wonderful! My hair felt so clean and my curls were so bouncy! I loved finding a conditioner that is chemical free and won&#x27;t damage my hair anymore! Most shampoos flatten my curls but this did not! Great product! Great price! Plus the light smell was great!</li>
            <li> I originally purchased two bottles of the Argan Oil Shampoo and was not a fan, since it left my hair bit to dry.  However I surprisingly found the Silk 18 conditioner worked beautifully.  I love how smooth my hair feels and so clean, and most importantly my hair no longer tangles into knots the day after I shampoo. I just wish it came in other scents other than vanilla.</li>
            <li> I have thick, course,  frizzy/curly hair. I wasn&#x27;t very impressed with the smoothing properties this shampoo.  I thought my hair felt like straw after using it.</li>
            <li> SUCH A GREAT CONDITIONER!!! I have long wavy hair that is on the dry side and this conditioner is perfection. It makes my hair super shiny and manageable and smooths the halo of frizz that humid summers can bring. And this effect lasts for days. I don&#x27;t shower every day nor use a bunch of products and would say that I&#x27;m on the less is more spectrum of life so this product fits the bill. What I like about this conditioner and maple Holistics Argan Oil Shampoo is that I can go 4 days (I&#x27;m an herbalist, goat lady and permaculture designer so I&#x27;m outside and busy!) between washings and my hair still looks good, my scalp feels good (no itch) and as a result I FEEL GOOD. I want my co-op to carry this conditioner and shampoo in bulk so that I can get away from the plastic bottles and am going to work on that. If you have fine hair, like my daughter does, you will want to use just a touch and not overdo it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been doing no-poo for over two months and needed something to help my hair from breaking at the ends. Just the slightest pull and my hair would snap, there was no elasticity despite trying coconut oil masks or egg/avocado masks on an almost daily basis. My poor hair has had to deal with hard water in the past and just hasn&#x27;t ever been strong since. I did some research and found that when people have low elasticity in their hair they either do better with a natural oil like coconut oil or with protein. I decided to try and look for a protein based conditioner that was natural so that it wouldn&#x27;t weigh down my hair with nasty chemicals. I have shoulder length hair that I wash with sifted rye flour (best no-poo shampoo I&#x27;ve tried) or occasionally a whole egg. This silk conditioner works wonderfully as is or as a leave in treatment. My hair is so noticeably soft and not heavy or greasy. I totally LOVE the scent and I think my family prefers it far more than the apple cider vinegar rinses I&#x27;ve used in the past. I love how natural the ingredients are and how strong and healthy my hair feels now. I have tried a few other products including: Hydrating Argan Oil Hair Mask and Deep Conditioner By Arvazallia, It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle Leave-in Product and DermOrganic Leave-In Treatment, and none of these items helped but I think it has to do with the fact that my hair does not want oil per say but a protein instead.</li>
            <li> So far this conditioner is great! I have only been able to use it a few times but my hair already feels soft and smooth and the smell is amazing! Definitely recommend this product, feels great to use something that is more natural for your hair that actually works!</li>
            <li> My favorite conditioner smells great and leaves my hair feeling soft.  I wish they would come with a bigger bottles. I run out really quick bc I have long hair.</li>
            <li> Smells Great! And I love that it&#x27;s pretty natural. I don&#x27;t see much of a difference when compared to other conditioners though.</li>
            <li> Great natural product line.  This conditioner contains most of the ingredients I was planning to treat my scalp with.  I just added their argan shampoo to my cart as well.</li>
            <li> came on time. will have to use it for a bit before i can tell for sure but it seems to be making my hair healthier!</li>
            <li> I really this conditioner, even though it leaked all over the packaging. I didn&#x27;t realize how small the bottle was until I got it. It smells very nice, Very sweet and vanilla, but I haven&#x27;t noticed to big of a difference in my hair since using it. It has a nice, creamy texture, which I like, plus the fact that it has no sulfates is good for my thick, curly/wavy hair. I hope to see more of a difference as I keep using this conditioner.</li>
            <li> After four uses, I like this conditioner very much. For reference, I have shoulder-blade length, thin, fine, wavy hair with little damage but fragile. It leaves my hair shiny, bouncy and soft, with no frizz or fly-aways.  The vanilla scent is a bit strong but does not linger long. All in all, very nice though.</li>
            <li> I have longer has for a man and it is naturally kind of rough, my friend recommended this product and after reading the reviews i decided to buy, and it has been awesome my hair feels so much softer and i have noticed that i do not have as many split ends as before...if you need to repair or to improve your hair I recommend this item.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a black woman with long, fine, wavy hair. This conditioner smells great and leaves my hair shiny and more manageable. When I&#x27;m out, I&#x27;ll be back for more.</li>
            <li> This conditioner relieved my dry itchy scalp and left my hair really smooth and soft.  Very happy with it.  Will used it on my kids&#x27; hair now too.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this for myself because I was tired of buying Pantene conditioner or other brands at Rite Aid, and thought I would try this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simply: The BEST conditioner I have ever used and more natural. My hair is so soft and shiny now and this doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down. I LOVE IT! My mom tried it and she can&#x27;t wait to get her own! Thank you, we are both very satisfied and we both thank you for it. It is refreshing to come across a product that actually does what it says!</li>
            <li> i have been in search of a natural conditioner and Silk 18 has surpassed my expectations. I noticed a change in the texture of my hair after using it for the first time.  Most importantly it has done it without the harmful additives. I get complements on my hair all the time now.</li>
            <li> This did nothing for my hair- I purchased along with the top selling natural shampoo with the best ratings on amazon and my hair is just as dry as before using the product. I tried consecutive use for 2 weeks and had to switch back to my old conditioner because brushing my hair became a tangled nightmare. Do not recommend.</li>
            <li> I bought this product thinking that it will make my hair sliky and good along with the Argan shampoo.. it just did it the opposite made it very dry and straw like feeling..&lt;br /&gt;My hair is usually soft and shine but using this product for couple of times made it look horrible and lifeless..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and yes its true that u get a free bottle if u leave a good review... so don&#x27;t be fooled by those reviews. PLEASE don&#x27;t waste your valuable time and money buying this product. This is a horrible conditioner! don&#x27;t buy</li>
            <li> I have long fine hair, and this conditioner did nothing for me. I also purchased the shampoo... Wasn&#x27;t impressed by it either. Would not recommend and would not repurchase.</li>
            <li> I really like the silk18 conditioner, one for the natural ingredients, it makes me feel better knowing I am not putting a bunch of chemicals on my head and I like what it does for my hair.  When I rinse it out, I usually leave a little in my hair, it isn&#x27;t greasy or stiff, it smells good and helps with the frizz.  I have naturally curly hair and need that extra conditioner because my hair tends to be dry.</li>
            <li> My hair is very thick and frizzy. I tried a lot of different conditioners but this one leaft my hair smelling great and feeling fresh! I loved this I&#x27;m letting my girls try it now😍</li>
            <li> I was really let down by this conditioner , I clearly was not looking for a miracle in a bottle just a product that would&lt;br /&gt;do what it promised.I will say it does have a lovely scent, and also made my hair shine nicely.</li>
            <li> This could be the nectar of the gods,but I won&#x27;t . buy it with such a product page. No sizing, no ingredients, and frankly it&#x27;s listed with a lot of hipster marketing BS. My wife is biracial with fantastic color and curls, but if you won&#x27;t give basic info to your customers willing to spend top dollar, you don&#x27;t deserve a penny.</li>
            <li> Useless! It breaks my hair and my customer&#x27;s hair even more now.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair but a good amount of it, and shoulder length.  My hair was so healthy after 2 years of doing nothing to it but always limp and lacked body.  Had the wonderful idea to get a perm and it totally fried my hair!  I could feel dryness up to 2 inches from the ends of my hair  :(  of course while one is trying to grow out hair the idea is not to have to cut it all off.  I have used the Silk 18 conditioner only 2 times and it has softened my hair and smoothed a ton of embarrassing frizz!  beauty is even without silicones!!! which over time just dry out your hair on top of coating it!  Love love love this conditioner!</li>
            <li> I love the way looked after using this conditioner. I want to try other products. My hair looks amazing.  Thank you Maple Holistics for making this product.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner! I have really thick, long, and wavy hair. I left this in my hair for 5 minutes while I washed my body and shaved my legs. I then combed it while I rinsed it out and wrapped my hair in a t-shirt when I was done. I then combed it again and braided it. Today my hair is so soft and shiny and very manageable. I will definitely be ordering this conditioner again and again and I will definitely recommend it to my friends. The scent is very faint to me and not strong at all.</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time yesterday and I was afraid it wasn&#x27;t going to be moisturizing enough as I rinsed my hair. I was also afraid my hair was going to be tangled. Well, it WAS moisturizing enough and my hair did de-tangle. Leave a little in. I think I like it. It certainly smells good. A warm Vanilla smell. It&#x27;s expensive for the amount you get but all these sulfate free etc. products are.</li>
            <li> BUY SILK 18. YOU WILL NOT BE DISSAPPOINTED.  This product is the best remedy for my dry, frizzy, thick, curly, color treated hair. The formula is spectacular; the smell is enticing almost like maple syrup. I will be purchasing in bulk.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair. I have never been able to just wake up and walk out the door with my hair natural. It is frizzy, unruly (and possibly scary) hair that I feel will never be tamed :( I tried Silk 18 Natural Conditioner based on reviews by other curly haired women and decided to give it a try. I cannot rave more about the smell! I love vanilla anyways and so the scent alone will keep me using it! It is warm and inviting and very soothing after a long day. As for the conditioning, I have used it 4 times so far. I take a shower before I go to bed and let my hair air dry (I know that this is part of the reason my hair is so unmanageable in the morning, but I like to go to bed clean ;) I normally awaken to a tangled, frizzy mess that looks as if it has more purpose in a birds nest than on my head. After using Silk 18 Natural Conditioner, I notice my hair is exponentially less frizzy! It actually is quite smooth at the top. The ends are still a bit frizzy but again, its probably because I have long hair and go to sleep with it wet. However, though they are frizzy I, I have notice they are less frizzy! I also am able to straighten my hair and style it way easier than normal and it looks healthier!!! It feels so much softer when I run my fingers through it and it seems to keep the style longer. I will definitely be buying this product again. I do wish it came in a bigger bottle.</li>
            <li> Smells great and my 6 year old thinks so too. I use it with the Rosemary shampoo. Love love this product.</li>
            <li> I have to wash my hair once or twice every day because of sports and other outdoor activities. Obviously, if I don&#x27;t use conditioner, my hair gets extremely dry. I use this conditioner every day and my hair feels and looks great without a greasy texture like some other conditioners leave. I like the vanilla smell, and I like that the bottle lasts a very long time even when I use it every day (and I have A LOT of hair for a guy).</li>
            <li> Great product,  love it</li>
            <li> This is the first time I step out of the shower and damp dried my hair, then comb it and hours later still no frizzy hair. I Love it, I&#x27;ll recommend it to friends.</li>
            <li> Four out of stars is a good thing!  I&#x27;d give it 5 stars but my hair is hard on conditioner reviews.  I&#x27;d compare it with WEN conditioner, if that helps.</li>
            <li> Awesome product! Purchase the shampoo and conditioner today and had it shipped out today. I love it! So far so good :)</li>
            <li> I read all the positive reviews and decided to try this conditioner on the strength of those reviews. I was not disappointed and the conditioner is awesome.  I&#x27;ve tried every high end product under the sun and found that most of them weigh my thin, curly hair down. Since my hair is colored I was looking for something that was both effective as a conditioner but would not strip the color.  Silk 18 left my hair soft, manageable and my curls were shining like the stars!.  I also ordered a bottle for my daughter and she was as impressed with it as I am!  This will be my go to conditioner from now on!!!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product!  I have very curly and coarse hair, and Silk 18 Natural Conditioner seems to be keeping it more manageable , less frizzy, and softer.  Also, the curls stay very well defined.</li>
            <li> this is an excellent, affordable product with quality ingredients. I like to leave it in my hair overnight and feel like it moisturizes just as well, if not better, than the chemical filled alternatives. people always comment on how good my hair smells after I use it! this stuff smells INCREDIBLE! I will definitely repurchase as long as maple holistics continues making this product!</li>
            <li> I just tried the shampoo and conditioner, so far so good! It&#x27;s the first time my hair actually feels clean and though my hair was left still a bit pouffy, it was definitely softer and felt lighter. Can&#x27;t wait to see how continued use will treat my hair. The price is pretty good considering other brands out there so it&#x27;s definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li> I have natural hair and this melts my hair like butter♡</li>
            <li> I really like this conditioner.  It does not leave hair feeling slimey.  I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Smells divine. Love how it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product. I was having a very hard time managing my naturally curly hair and had been shampoo and conditioner shopping for something that would encourage my curls without making my hair look frizzy.  This did the trick (in combination with Maple Holistics Argan Oil Shampoo!). It smells amazing and I disagree with previous reviewers that say the scent is overwhelming. I love how NATURALLY soft my hair feels when I get out of the shower, versus full of junk that doesn&#x27;t wash out properly and leaves my hair dull. I&#x27;ll be back for more!</li>
            <li> Very good conditioner.</li>
            <li> I like the conditioner, but am not blown away by it. The vanilla scent is nice, but stronger than I would like in a conditioner. In fact, hours later, I can still smell the vanilla scent in my hair. I have yet to find a conditioner that helps my thin, fine hair be more full. This conditioner is a little better than other conditioners I have used because my hair is not limp, but I will continue searching for a better conditioner for my hair.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product , my hair feels silky and smooth , i deff recommend it :)</li>
            <li> Well I have a kind of wavy and somewhat curly hair. Most of the times after washing my hair it tends to frizz fast. I like to straighten it, but like my natural hair too... Don&#x27;t want to use my natural look as much as possible...so I have tried serums to control frizz, but I ended up with unusual side effect... The hair serums I used caused my skin to breakout :( so when I was searching for a good conditioner I came across this one customer review seems to be pretty good so wanted to try. On my first use it was good. But on the second time I started using it as a leave in conditioner too.. And the results are amazing I got very nice curls and the most important thing no frizz for a long time.</li>
            <li> This conditioner smells so overpowering, like an old Victoria&#x27;s Secret Vanilla scent girls used to wear years ago.  I don&#x27;t like the smell of cheap perfumes, Wen Haircare products, and other conventional hair products.  They give me a headache and I don&#x27;t like feeling that I can&#x27;t get away from the smell.  I used this shampoo after using Maple Holistic&#x27;s Argan Oil Shampoo (zero smell).  The smell of this conditioner was one of the worst I have ever encountered.  It&#x27;s also full of alcohol and not seemingly all that different from conventional conditioners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thin, dry, long hair that is very prone to tangling.  This conditioner exacerbated my tangles and my hair got unmanageable after only two tries.  Can not stand the smell.  Not using again.</li>
            <li> Very nice! I fill it right in my scalp-it alive now! So fresh! So healthy! I will by it again and again!</li>
            <li> Beautiful vanilla scent. Did not trigger my allergies. Leaves hair silky, soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> Having thick and curly hair I haven&#x27;t had a lot of luck with natural products. I am pleasantly surprised by this conditioner! Even while I was still in the shower I noticed that my hair felt great and was super soft after the first use. The really crazy part is that I didn&#x27;t have to use a ton of it to fully coat my hair and this isn&#x27;t a super thick formula. I usually need a handful of conditioner to feel like my strands are thoroughly coated. For once I feel like a bottle of conditioner will actually last me for a bit. A couple times I&#x27;ve used a tiny bit as a leave-in also. It worked really well to keep frizz down through the day. This may not be appropriate for someone with thinner hair, but I benefit from some extra weight. The smell is pretty sweet and does stick with you but luckily I enjoy the smell. I&#x27;m looking forward to trying other products by these guys. According to the reviews it looks like they have some winners!</li>
            <li> I always looked for products with 5 star reviews...found silk 18 conditioner and i was like okay let&#x27;s try this and after about 2nd week i started liking the conditioner my hair felt reallyyy silky, awsomeee BUT just for some time upon drying it was very dry and dull and same as any other regular drug store brand conditioner&#x27;s so basically the overhype of the product is for a FREE product....&lt;br /&gt;  But i give it 3 stars just for that luxurious feeling of the hair.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner. I have fine hair that is color treated and need a really good conditioner or I can&#x27;t get a comb through it after showering. This is the best conditioner I have ever used, and it&#x27;s all natural, which is a huge plus for me. I will continue to order this product, and plan to try out their shampoo as well.</li>
            <li> I leave it on for at least 5 minutes before rinsing and my hair softens well.&lt;br /&gt;My ends are still a bit dry after although most of my hair texture comes out softer.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d probably buy it again.</li>
            <li> I am really loving this conditioner so far!! It made my hair feel very soft and did a good job of detangling my thick, naturally curly hair.  I would have given it 5 stars but it is very lightweight and I feel like I had to use quite a bit of product in order to thoroughly concentrate my hair from roots to tips.</li>
            <li> Since I became more conscientious about products I used in my daily life, I went on a quest for a natural shampoo and air conditioner. I have tried probably 5-6 products before I discovered Maple Holistic Silk 18 and I finally found a natural shampoo that helps to nourish my hair with great ingredients while leaving it shiny, light and silky. I was at the point where I felt completely discouraged, since everything I tried prior to Silk 18 had lots to desire in the final results. Alas, Silk is perfect for my hair and I highly recommend it. It smells nice too, which is surprisingly rare among natural products. I just hope the price remains around $12-14 dollar.</li>
            <li> Love the vanilla scent &amp; leaves my hair so soft, will not go back to buying any other shampoo&#x27;s or conditioners other than Maple Holistics!</li>
            <li> I would like to recommend this conditioner. The vanilla smell is very pleasant, and it&#x27;s not very thick like most other conditioners, but not less effective. I have long, thick and fuzzy hair, after applying this conditioner, my hair becomes smooth and easy to comb. I really like the idea of natural ingredients, which is better for our health. I only used it a couple of times, I will stick to it for a while to see if it can finally improve my hair condition.</li>
            <li> Smells great and made my hair super soft. I am very impressed.  I will buy again</li>
            <li> My scalp hasn&#x27;t felt this good in years! I have dry hair and skin which made a perfect combo for dandruff. Since using this stuff every 2-3 days I have had no dandruff.</li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner is great.  It smells good and keeps your hair feeling soft and lightweight</li>
            <li> OMGOSH!!! This stuff TRULY lives up to it&#x27;s reputation/reviews. The smell alone is enough to keep me a regular customer. I have pretty coarse hair and this stuff smoothed it out beautifully without weighing it down or leaving it looking greasy. Did I mention the SMELL?? I feel like I&#x27;m at a spa while in the shower and the smell lasts even when your hair is dry. Seriously, you will NOT be disappointed. SO glad I stumbled upon it while looking for an alternative conditioner.</li>
            <li> For the first time I have found a conditioner I am willing to purchase again and again. I was on a quest for years to find a conditioner that WORKS and is free of parabens and synthetic perfumes. This is it. It works great- smooths my coarse, unruly hair. The scent is gentle and not overpowering. It leaves my hair feeling smooth and softened.</li>
            <li> This plastic bottle is the WORSE!  Its so absurdly thick and rigid that, even squeezing as hard as you can with two hands, it impossible to get the conditioner out.  There is only one way to get the stuff out. You have to screw open the cap and shake out the contents.  To taunt you even further, the bottle includes one of those tilt caps designed for dispensing the product. But as it&#x27;s impossible for human hands to compress this bottle, there is no possible chance the conditioner will ever make it through the tilt cap dispenser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can store it upside down or right side up. It won&#x27;t matter. The only way to get the conditioner out is to unscrew the useless tilt cap and shake, shake, shake.</li>
            <li> Made it here on time and in good shape, but it made my hair feel dry and brittle</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful. I can see results at first use. My hair looks and feel like silk</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT IT THE FIRST PRODUCT OUT OF MANY THAT ACTUALLY WORK I CAN GO TO WASHING MY HAIR EVERYOTHER DAY WITHOUT USING DRY SHAMPOO AND LOOKING LIKE I POUR GREASE ON MY HAIR PLAN ON BUYING ANPTHER BOTTLE NEXT WEEK TO MAKE SURE I DONT RUN OUT ITS A BIT PRICEY BUT WORTH IT</li>
            <li> The Silk 18 conditioner makes my hair so soft and shiny. It has a wonderful smell and I could not believe how much better my hair felt after the first time I used it. I will definitely buy this product again!</li>
            <li> I am a product junkie and am in a constant search for my holy grail hair product. Sadly, Silk 18 is not it. I am almost done with the bottle, and I didn&#x27;t notice any difference whatsoever.</li>
            <li> The minute I received the silk18 conditioner by Maple Holistics I immediately ran to wash my hair because I was so excited to try it out. I had read the reviews before buying and was eager to see for myself. My hair is curly and usually on the dry side. First of all the smell is amazing.. slightly sweet but not overpowering. Right after I washed/conditioned my hair it felt rich. It has a beautiful silky feel and a lot of shine. Overall I am very pleased with this product so far and can&#x27;t wait to see what the continued use will do for my hair!</li>
            <li> As a young man, I have long curly hair and also because of very dry weather here I have had big amounts of hair lose, and my hair is usually like so dry and bad looking after wash. Due to reviews I found this product and used after using argan oil shampoo. As stated on its name, after I rinse it my hair was like silk and I thought i still have some conditioner to rinse out, but no it was my hair. Additionally, it smells amazingly good that I want to  smell my hair day long :) as it is natural, I can safely use it and with ingredients I believe that it really helps my hair to recover and be all well!</li>
            <li> I received the condtioner on time.  I like it and I see the different  already. I&#x27;m happy about the result and I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Not good for my natural curls.  Seems too heavy for my fine hair</li>
            <li> I purchased this conditioner after a friend&#x27;s recommendation, and I&#x27;m definitely glad I did! This conditioner leaves my hair feeling silky soft and a little bit goes a long way. I will be purchasing again. My only complaint is that the conditioner is a little hard to get out of the bottle but it wasn&#x27;t a huge deal.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner.  I usually use a hair mask once a week because I have dry hair, and I have been only doing that every other week because this product works fabulously.  I will be buying this conditioner again.</li>
            <li> After using this product my hair is smooth and the frizz is gone.</li>
            <li> I was excited to recieve this conditioner as I am trying to use more natural products. First thing is first, this smells incredible. It smells of vanilla and my hair felt so smooth after using it. I&#x27;m not used to conditioning all of my hair, I would usually pull my hair back into a ponytail and condition the ends but I was pleased with the results after using this conditioner once, it didn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy or oily. I will be ordering the shampoo as well!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the shower &amp; bath gel at the gym so I thought I&#x27;d get my own and saw this! The size is perfect and the reviews are great so I was sold instantly. So far I like the smell even though it&#x27;s not something I&#x27;d usually pick, but after using it my hair is smooth and easy to comb through and soft the rest of the day. I have oily skin so if I don&#x27;t break out using this by the end of the bottle the I&#x27;ll definitely purchase it again!</li>
            <li> I have Southeast Asian hair that is exceptionally dry and prone to knotting.  This conditioner, in a brief amount of time, has made my hair look and feel soft, shiny and healthy.  It has also allowed me to comb daily through my hair with ease.  I have very long hair, but a dime to quarter-sized amount is all that I need to saturate my ends.  Since I have an itchy, oily scalp, I will always refrain from using conditioners directly on it. So I cannot speak to how this conditioner might feel or affect one&#x27;s scalp.  All in all, I&#x27;m satisfied with this conditioner and will definitely be purchasing more in the future.</li>
            <li> Nice smelling &amp; very thick. My hair is naturally very fine &amp; easily tangled, especially when wet. Using this conditioner my wet brush slides right through not only when my hair is coated in conditioner but ALSO when it&#x27;s rinsed out after towel drying!!</li>
            <li> This conditioner is my favorite conditioner and my husband is hooked too. The conditioner will not have a dramatic effect on your hair right away but it does make my hair silkier and healthier over time. I had switched back to my other hair product after finishing the first bottle because I was not very impressed by the shampoo/conditioner. But then I started to notice an increase in fallen hair in my shower and an irritated scalp. I realized then how much this conditioner has been helping me. I would highly recommend trying this out and give it a couple months to see the result.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair very smooth .. I love it</li>
            <li> Not the greatest conditioner I ever used. I will not buy it again.</li>
            <li> A conditioner that offers everything that you want and nothing that you don&#x27;t. The fact that it is vegan and all natural is why I bought it, but the results were fabulous. The vanilla frangrance is fresh and natrual I usually wash my hair before bed and the vanilla scent helps to sooth to sleep. My hair is full of body with no hampering residue. I&#x27;m very happy with my new conditioner.</li>
            <li> Better than expected - if it continues to work I will give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with this conditioner.  It&#x27;s not greasy and leaves my hair feeling really soft.  I&#x27;ve also been using it on my daughter&#x27;s hair which was damaged by pool water, sun, and brushing too hard.  This conditioner has made a big difference with repairing her locks!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 4 year old daughter who has very fine curly hair, that is prone to tangling.  It made her hair so soft and smell so good after one use.  I liked that it didn&#x27;t make my hands fill super oily/nasty like the grocery store conditioner I had been using (for about 10 min after applying the cheap conditioner, my hands would always feel so gross even after washing) but with this conditioner after I rinsed once my hands felt clean.  I will def continue using this on my daughter&#x27;s hair and will try it on my own long hair once my Pureology runs out.</li>
            <li> I just started using this product. I use the argan shampoo and silk 18 conditioner, I love the combination together.  I have extensions and I&#x27;ve been looking for a good shampoo and conditioner that is sulfate free that doesn&#x27;t cost a fortune. No matter if they are new extensions or not, nothing leaves my hair feeling nice and silky, and I&#x27;ve used many different conditioners. Since I&#x27;ve been using it, my hair feels so soft and silky, my extensions don&#x27;t feel dried out or dead. I love this! The bottle is a little small, but its not that expensive for what you get and how it makes your hair feel. Oh and I love the smell! If you have dry or damaged hair or you have extensions and need a good conditioner, try this you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> Ok. Really people need to pipe down. The card that asks for a review requests for the buyer to leave a review, it does not say leave a positive review. So those who are saying that apparently need to brush up on their reading comprehension skills.&lt;br /&gt;Also, it says if you leave a review you MAY receive a free product. Seems like a random drawing kind of thing to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I love what this product has done for my toddlers curly, fine hair. It has made it so manageable and silky!&lt;br /&gt;For my hair, so far it&#x27;s pretty good. I don&#x27;t expect any naturally based product to magically make me have movie star hair, but it has made it soooo much smoother and less tangled which was a problem for me before. I love the smell. A lot.&lt;br /&gt;Edit: I have been using this conditioner on mine and my toddlers hair for over a month now. And wow! My hair is the most manageable it has ever been and my toddlers hair is finally not a frizzy mess! I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The picture shown is my toddlers hair! It&#x27;s gorgeous!</li>
            <li> The short version - My hair is very dry and frizzy and used to be thick and course, but has been thinning significantly as I&#x27;ve gotten older.  This stuff made my hair very soft, with a feeling like a toddler&#x27;s hair.  My hair feels lighter, not as weighed down, so the shorter,  broken hairs are still a bit flyaway, but not in the same frizzy sort of way they used to be.  And after 2 months, my hair is not as thin anymore.  I love it and would recommend other give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The slightly longer version - I have very dry, frizzy, wavy hair that has thinned as I&#x27;ve gotten older and became much more broken since I&#x27;ve moved to a house with very hard water a few years ago.  It is medium length, about mid-shoulder blades when wet.  I&#x27;ve been using this Silk18 conditioner with the the Maple Holistics Hydrate Shampoo for Dry Hair and Flaking Scalp for about 2 months now.  I wanted to know how it would work somewhat longer term.  I&#x27;ve used some shampoo/conditioners that seem great for the first couple of weeks and then don&#x27;t work well anymore.  Nothing I&#x27;ve tried has worked well for this long, and I&#x27;ve tried things from the inexpensive Garnier Fructis Sleek &amp; Shine to the more expensive Wen Fig and a lot in between.  The first thing I noticed after using the Maple Holistics shampoo &amp; conditioner was that it made my hair really soft.  It also made my hair feel light and not weighed down.  Because of this I think that some of the broken hairs that I have at the  front were actually a bit more flyaway at first, but not in the frizzy way they used to be.  As time has gone by, my hair is still soft, the flyaway broken hair is slightly (but not a lot) less flyaway, and my hair feels somewhat thicker and fuller at the roots as well as through the length of my hair.  I am very happy that I&#x27;ve finally found something that helps my hair look and feel healthier and I&#x27;m hoping that it will help with the broken hair as time goes by.  I would recommend it to others with dry or frizzy hair.  I will update in the future if there is any significant difference in my hair after a few more months.</li>
            <li> Best conditioner ever! I have colored hair so it gets really dry especially after coloring it but this conditioner is amazing! I feel the difference with this conditioner when I get out of the shower and even days later. And it smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> I recently had my hair highlighted for the first time and wanted to purchase a good moisturizing conditioner to keep my hair from becoming frizzy and damaged.  I read the reviews on this product and decided to give it a try.  I have been using it for 2 weeks and have to say I am pretty happy with it.  I was previously using a drug store conditioner and the Silk 18 leaves my hair softer and less frizzy when it dries (I usually let my hair dry naturally).  I am very happy with my purchase so far.  My only complaint is that as it rinses off my hair I have trouble fully rinsing it from my body and I feel like my whole body is slick and silky.  Some people might like this but I like to be more squeaky clean when I rinse off so 4/5 stars from me.</li>
            <li> Does not seem to de-tangle or improve my hair at all. In fact, tend to weigh my hair down a bit. With lots of fine hair, I do have to take it into consideration that, perhaps a person with thick hair may like it.</li>
            <li> Great smelling light-weight conditioner! It leaves my hair soft and shiny without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> My hair and I have been searching for and trying out &#x27;natural&#x27; shampoos and conditioners for several years.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this conditioner along with Maple Holistics Argan Oil Shampoo for three weeks now....&lt;br /&gt;This conditioner goes on and combs through easier than any conditioner I have ever used before.&lt;br /&gt;Even with our well water, it rinses out cleanly and leaves my long, fine, thin hair feeling and looking great.&lt;br /&gt;Thank You, Maple Holistics .... my hair and I plan to stay with you for a long time.</li>
            <li> I am not impressed with this conditioner, but to be honest my hair needs a lot of work. I use a liberal amount of this conditioner and I feel like I need to use half the bottle to feel like my hair is conditioned. Since it&#x27;s pricey (for me) I can&#x27;t see half the bottle because I want it to last. I will continue to use this conditioner and maybe that&#x27;s what my hair needs. After a weeks use I am in the mind set to try a different Maple Holistics conditioner. This one isn&#x27;t for me, but will update this review after I&#x27;ve completed the bottle. It does seen wonderful though!</li>
            <li> Not only does this smell nice but it leaves your hair silky soft. This is my go conditioner. It doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down. I love it!!!</li>
            <li> This conditioner made my hair feel great. So smooth and wonderful. Most importantly it kept my flyaways from flying away. I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> This made my very healthy hair extremely dry, so dry it was difficult to brush thru.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because I have really dry hair and wanted more moisture and shine.  It works great - my hair feels better after washing with thier Argan Oil Shampoo &amp; conditioning, and it&#x27;s prettier.  At first I was thinking this was a bit pricey - but I use almost 1/2 the amount that I was using of Panteine.  So it&#x27;s really not more expensive because it lasts much longer.  Will definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m liking this product and hope to reach the 5 star mark with continued use.  I&#x27;m used to lathering on quite a bit of conditioner because my hair is so dry but with this one, I&#x27;m using about a quarter size, maybe a squeeze more, and getting the same results.  I must say my hair is definitely in better shape than when I began using it, but I also attribute that to a sunflower/castor oil mask I made at home.  I find myself having less breakage.  I also developed a little issue with my scalp becoming oily the day after washing my hair but I&#x27;ve noticed I can now go 2/3 days without a wash and not have any issue whatsoever with excessive oil production.  There&#x27;s only two things I would change with this product: 1. a bigger bottle would be nice, 2. smell is too subtle for my taste.  Overall I highly recommend trying this.</li>
            <li> I used to spend a lot of money with famous brand, believing that a $40 dollars shampoo or a $30 dollars conditioner could repair your hair, and I was wrong, that is the second time I bought this conditioner and I couldn&#x27;t be happier, I am saving my money and this conditioner gives a balance to my hair, keeps soft and hydrate for days, and with a amazing smell. I super recommend this product for normal hair like mine. Love it!</li>
            <li> Not a bad product, great shipping, nice vanilla scent, but kind of watery and certainly not super moisturizing or a detangler. I have shortish fine hair, did not help unravel my little tangles (if you have fine hair, you understand why this matters, can&#x27;t tug through like heartier tresses.) Ultimately overpriced, will not purchase again. Sorry Maple - I wanted to love you.</li>
            <li> This conditioner goes hand in hand with their shampoo. My hair has never felt better and my hair dresser even commented on how nice my hair feels.</li>
            <li> My friend introduced me to this fabulous product. Since starting to use it, I&#x27;ve received comments that my hair are brighter and glossier.My hair was breaking off a lot and after using this product I can really tell a difference. Helps my hair feel silky and smooth. Smells great.</li>
            <li> smells so good. Without itchy after applying small amount. Will continue use it to see if the effect lasts. Some products I tried work at first, then after a while, the magic disappears.</li>
            <li> I have coarse wavy hair.  Living near the ocean, it usually feels coarse with a puffy unkept appearance not matter what I do to it.  After one use of Silk 18, there was noticeable difference in the texture of my hair.  I am very satisfied with this product and am looking forward to seeing how much it will continue to help my hair with repeated use.</li>
            <li> I like the smell and it&#x27;s great that the ingredients are natural. So far I am liking it!</li>
            <li> Smells delicious and leaves my hair feeling so silky after just a few minutes.  I paired it with the Argan shampoo and have seen amazing results since!</li>
            <li> This product seems to help my hair be shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li> this is one of the best conditioners I have used!! I have curly hair and I am always looking for products to leave my hair soft and frizz free, this product do the job. I don&#x27;t know if they have it on bigger sizes, but i would like a bigger one.</li>
            <li> I am not one that uses conditioner that often because it tends to make my hair look greasy and dirty but after using the Natural Conditioner I fell in love! The scent is amazing, the way it makes my hair look is amazing, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the product!</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful! I have very dry, damaged hair and this product is a miracle! It made my hair so soft! I cannot live without this!</li>
            <li> Works okay for my relaxed hair but left a medicine like smell behind. I tried on my daughters natural hair and it worked good (no medicine like smell there). I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for relaxed hair but an okay produce for natural hair. I would have preferred something with maybe shea butter or egg white proteins.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m seriously never wasting my time on another conditioner again. I&#x27;m 28 years old and if you could see my collection of half-used bottles of conditioners, you&#x27;d be appalled at how much money I&#x27;ve wasted over the years trying to find the holy grail of conditioners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is fine, half-wavy, tangles easily, and is still recovering from a lot of color and bleach damage from some poor choices. No matter how much conditioner I use, my hair always feels dry and frizzy -- or alternately, weighed down by goopy conditioner. I used to use volumizing conditioner from Big Sexy Hair and alternate with Ion&#x27;s Deep Repair Conditioner for color-treated hair, but results weren&#x27;t really consistent. Now those bottles are relegated to the under-sink area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really can&#x27;t believe that this stuff works so well and is made from natural ingredients. My hair is soft, shiny, and fluffy! The bottle is pretty small, so I try to use it sparingly when I wash every other day, but it lasts me about a month and a half with my hair just past shoulder length. Luckily, it&#x27;s not very expensive, and I think it&#x27;s totally worth it. I will seriously never use another conditioner again. And I feel really good about using a product from a smaller company with a focus on using natural ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This review was NOT paid for or compensated in any way; I&#x27;m actually just writing it because I&#x27;m so in love with this product. I&#x27;ve started using the hydrating shampoo as well and I really like it, though it does pull out a lot of color from my hair -- so use carefully if you&#x27;ve got color-treated hair. Either way, this conditioner works great regardless of what shampoo you use with it!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about all natural products, but Maple Holistcs proved me wrong with this conditioner and their Shampoo for Dry Hair. They left my hair feeling clean and smooth, without looking oily or weighed down. I have naturally wavy long hair and it&#x27;s extremely important that my conditioner is very detangling. I am happy to report that I have no problem getting a brush through my hair after using this product. I would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a conditioner with natural ingredients. Silk 18 is better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried. It leaves my hair shiny and silky. I have gray hair and this leaves it very silver. Smells nice too!!</li>
            <li> As a girl with &amp;#34;problem&amp;#34; hair, my hair has always been a nightmare. Finally someone pulled me aside and told me I&#x27;ve got a &amp;#34;nice wave to my hair&amp;#34;, and my curly girl journey began. I&#x27;ve since been trying different ways to bring out my best curl. I was always afraid of conditioner because my hair can get really greasy and oily real quick, but I read that curly hair needs moisture, so I gave conditioners a try, as well as trying to go &amp;#34;no-poo&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;lo-poo&amp;#34;. My last bottle of conditioner was okay but kind of thin and watery. This bad boy is thick, creamy, and luscious. It conditions well and with a little gel to prevent frizz it leaves my hair shiny, curly, and smooth. It smells mild and that&#x27;s perfect (no &amp;#34;tropical coconut&amp;#34; crap). The bottle is a bit smaller than I thought it would be when it arrived, I guess you pay for the quality and you don&#x27;t get a lot of it. I&#x27;d like to say a little goes a long way but actually I use quite a bit of it even on my shoulder-length hair. I&#x27;m a convert now--girls, you can&#x27;t over-condition. Moisturize that hair and it will thank you! The next thing I&#x27;m going to try is using this and skipping the gel, that will be the ultimate test. I&#x27;ll update this review when I find a day I want to risk that experiment.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner, but the price is high.</li>
            <li> This is the best conditioner that I have ever used on my hair! Not only does it have a light refreshing vanilla smell but even better is the results! My hair has never been so soft and it is also not frizzy. I used to have to put oils and de-frizzers in my hair after every shower. I can comb my hair and let it dry and it is soft curls. I love that if I am just bumming around I do not have to put any product in my hair. As expensive as natural and organic product is it is nice to be able to just use it when I am going somewhere that I would need to do something with my hair. But as far as everyday I can just shower and air dry. I love that there are no harsh chemicals and that it is truly all ingredients that are good. The best part is that it works and I do not have to sacrifice a bad hair day to use a product that is good for my hair and skin.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product based on good Amazon reviews after asking my hairdresser what kind of conditioner works best on color treated hair, shoulder length hair. She suggested a sulfate free product. I agree with the many other positive reviews. It has improved the condition of my hair in the two weeks I have used it. I will definitely purchase it again. Customer service is also good. A few days after delivery I received an e-mail from a customer service representative asking if I had received the product,  and inquiring about my satisfaction. Nice touch!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a bad hair but this &amp;#34;silk&amp;#34; makes it very flat , unmanageable, and very static. May be it works for curly hair to flat them down but terrible choice for strait blond hair.</li>
            <li> I really like the conditioning properties to this natural conditioner. What I don&#x27;t care for is the VERY VERY vanilla smell.  I&#x27;m not a vanilla kind of person. I don&#x27;t like vanilla candles, air freshener, soaps, etc.  BUT, I deal with it because it makes my long hair feel healthy. I&#x27;d buy this again!</li>
            <li> I’m so incredibly happy about my purchase!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair has always been dry and frizzy. I was somewhat reluctant in trying this conditioner because nothing has ever worked for me, not even argan oil. I hardly ever even used heat on my hair...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only did this conditioner exceed my expectations, my hair has never been smoother, softer, or easier to manage. It smells wonderful and  but just a little bit of the conditioner has greatly improved the look and feel of my hair! I also purchased the Sage Shampoo. My hair feels so clean without feeling stripped of its natural oils. With that being said, it feels hydrated but not oily (at least not for 3 days for me). Other conditioners always make my hair feel heavy and oily. I’ve been raving on and on about how great it smells and how a little goes a long way. I never write reviews but I’m so incredibly happy with my purchase that I want to share and support this product. Additionally, the Natural Conditioner doesn&#x27;t leave any gross residue on your skin like other conditioners and, hello, it&#x27;s all natural! My mother has been hoarding tons of shampoos and conditioners from Costco (it’s hard for a lady to resist those prices hahaha) and I’m about to tell her to give them away to her friends so she can make the switch to natural products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maple Holistic&#x27;s products are not exactly cheap, but I definitely think the products are worth the money! Because my hair doesn&#x27;t feel as dirty or oily, a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I have only used it twice and so far I don&#x27;t notice as much of a difference as others have. However it smells good and it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down or make it greasy looking so that is good. I have been using it with the argan shampoo</li>
            <li> Nothing special, my hair stays dry and unmanageable after using this product. Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> I have kinky/curly hair and this product makes my hair very easy to detangle. It&#x27;s also good to use as a deep conditioner. Even after washing it out, my hair feels pretty well moisturized.</li>
            <li> I tried this conditioner because I was looking for something that would work on my fine, straight hair.  I need a strong conditioner as it gets tangled and static, but I wanted something all-natural and cruelty-free.  I am totally addicted to this conditioner and have also been using the shampoo.  It works incredibly well, and the amazing smell is an added benefit.</li>
            <li> This conditioner gave my fine flyaway hair lots of body and shine, however after a few uses it made my hair seem dry with lots of frizzy flyaways.&lt;br /&gt;I was very disappointed. However, Maple Holistics contacted me to see If I was satisfied with this product, When I told them not really and why they sent me a free product of my choosing. I received a free bottle of Argon oil conditioner, which I just love.&lt;br /&gt;So this product did not work for me, But the customer service is great and I am happy with the replacement conditioner.</li>
            <li> I originally ordered Silk18 Natural Conditioner (and the Maple Holistics Teatree Oil Shampoo) for my granddaughter who recently had head lice and had to have her very long, curly hair cut short after chemical lice treatments.  I had hoped the Silk 18 conditioner would calm her unruly dried out hair.  It has certainly lived up to her expectations and mine. The shine is back in her hair and it is much more manageable.  On a personal note, I have color treated my hair for years and have always used very expensive salon shampoos and conditioners.  I decided to try Silk 18 and love the softness and luscious vanilla scent it gives my hair.  The argan and jojoba oils along with other natural ingredients have really improved the dryness of my processed hair.  I absolutely love this conditioner!  .</li>
            <li> I just received this last week and have natural wavy hair (i have dyed for years) but do not use heating irons, curling  or even blow dry more than 2-3 times a week TOPS. I got lucky with thicker full head of coarse, dry and frizzy mess with out product. I immediately noticed the softness, shine and overall &amp;#34;tameness Silk 18 brought. The ingredient deck is AWESOME (minus containing Alcohol a little premature in Ingrd. deck )ithe  the Best conditioner i used in over 10 years. That includes working at 3 hair salons (with &amp;#34;professional grade&amp;#34; , tried WEN ....So far I am impressed with Silkyness of hair and overall results. Will return after month ( i condition 6-7 days a week and shampoo 3-4 tops bc of nature. I recommend for any hair type and smell is absolutely  scrumptious for Men or Women!</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair, but it is thick. In other words, I have a lot of fine hair. Conditioners either typically weigh my hair down, making it limp and flat, or conditioners are too light, essentially doing nothing. Silk 18 is perfect for my hair. I use a tiny amount (a nickel-sized dollop) and I only apply it to the ends, and I rinse after a minute or so. My hair is less tangled, and very soft. The tangles come out much easier. I&#x27;m impressed, and will continue to use this conditioner for as long as I can.</li>
            <li> makes my hair feel amazing, love it!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found a better conditioner since I stopped using commercial products. I have very coarse and dry hair, and I&#x27;ve tried one too many natural conditioners from Whole Foods and Lush, with no results. This product is soooo good for my hair I had to try it twice just to believe it! Leaves my hair sooo soft. One thing that bothers me though is the vanilla scent. I&#x27;m not a fan of vanilla, it makes me naseaus. If they had it in another scent this product would deserve more than 5 stars. If you don&#x27;t mind the smell of vanilla you should definitely go for this product.</li>
            <li> not in love with the smell, it does work (detangles, conditions), but did not notice a giant difference in hair.</li>
            <li> Horrible conditioner. I used this on my hair, and after leaving it in for about 10 minutes, rinsed, it felt horrible. My hair was even harder to brush, as I have long thick blonde hair. I felt my hair turned into a giant dread after using this product, and if anyone has long thick hair like I do, look for other options. I felt since I have done hours of research on different conditioners (including this particular one) I figured I found a great solution, but was mistakenly wrong.</li>
            <li> This is the best conditioner I have EVER used. I had to start by using it as a leave-in due to corkscrewing, a mess I have been trying to resolve for months. My hair is now free, no loss, feels and looks healthy. Truly silky, shiny, totally manageable and smells yummy too! Will set up up for regular delivery.  Never want to run out! The company ethics match my own, or I would not have bought it.</li>
            <li> So I think I just found the conditioner I am going to use the rest of my life. This stuff is amazing! It smell like a vanilla candle and I have only been using it for a week but my hair feels great. It feels 10x stronger and it is so soft and shiny now. I love it and I would recommend this product to anyone and everyone.</li>
            <li> Works great, and the value/price balance is ok at $12. If it was more expensive I&#x27;m not sure if I would buy again, since the bottle is rather small.</li>
            <li> This is hands down the BEST conditioner I have ever used. I have very thick, long hair that has natural curl. It is hard for me to find a conditioner that works well and that leaves my hair soft. I don&#x27;t have to use much of Silk 18 to get great results. My hair has never felt better. It rinses well. I only wash my hair twice a week and it stays soft even on the days I only rinse with hot water.</li>
            <li> I have very coarse, dry, hair (being a red head - we have very dry hair naturally). After moving to NYC in the winter I found my hair even dryer than normal and my scalp becoming to dry out fairly badly which I put down to a complete lack of any humidity in this part of the world during the winter (I&#x27;m originally from Australia).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use Silk 18 as a conditioner and leave it in for about 5 minutes before rinsing out and have noticed a significant improvement in the softness in my hair and also, my dry scalp is starting to subside!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After this I also bought Maple&#x27;s Argan Oil shampoo and use them both together now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like the fact that they are chemical free - compared to your typical big box store offerings these are the perfect alternative for people looking to avoid covering their bodies with chemical ridden products.</li>
            <li> No big difference, and much higher in price then other products</li>
            <li> Amazing amazing ...really this product leaves your hair super soft. I had frizzy hair and was looking for some conditioner which can help in smoothening of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;This product works so well.....I would recommend this product to all who have damaged due to color or have frizzy hair...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just give it a try and you would be happy ...really it works.....</li>
            <li> Loving this product!! It works perfectly and just as it should! After the first use there was an obvious change! And it smells fantastic!</li>
            <li> Smells incredible and the scent lasts without being cloying or headache-inducing. Also leaves my baby fine (but terribly dry) hair feeling soft and smoothe. Seriously obsessed  I will be reordering this!!</li>
            <li> So far I really like this product.  My hair is thick and dry, and I live in a dry climate so I always use a conditioner, sometimes oil, too.  My hair feels nicely conditioned and is not unruly after using silk 18.  I plan to take some camping in the desert to use as a light-weight leave in conditioner.  It is also true that I may get a product for writing this review,  but, I can still review it any way I like.  It is kind of a small bottle for the price, which may be the only draw back.</li>
            <li> I have tried conditioner after conditioner to de-frizz my thick, dry, curly hair. This product really makes a difference in my hair. The curls are more defined and my hair is so much softer. I will continue to buy Silk18, I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> My hair used to be dry and flyaway.  Very unmanageable.  Now it is much better.  Recommend product for dry, thin, color treated hair.</li>
            <li> seems to be pretty awesome.  its a pretty small bottle but it left my hair feeling wonderful/soft and light after one use.  so no complaints</li>
            <li> This product is great! It contains many natural ingredients so it has a lot of benefits!</li>
            <li> I have no idea how this conditioner got sooo many good reviews. I know everyone&#x27;s hair is different but this is possibly one of the worst conditioners I have ever used. I only wash my hair once or twice a week so not to over strip the natural oils. I have very easily tangled hair and need a conditioner that does a great job with the knots. I had such high hopes for this, due to all the wonderful reviews but it took me an antire 30 minutes to finally rip all the tangles out of my hair, even after using my regular products after this one. I also used two applications and a good amount of product each time, leaving it on for 2-3 minutes. I have no idea why my hair didn&#x27;t cooperate with this product but I will be returning it!</li>
            <li> This smells like vanilla icecream. Love the smell and texture. My hair looks and feels amazing.</li>
            <li> Really like the conditioner!! Not heavy, and leaved hair feeling really soft</li>
            <li> I have suffered with thin hair all my life (63 years).  My hair also has damaged ends and doesn&#x27;t hold a style.  I purchased this shampoo along with the Silk 18 conditioner about a month ago, and I can really see and feel a difference in my hair.  It has more shine and body, and it feels thicker.  After shampooing, I use the Silk 18 Conditioner; and my hair feels so clean afterward.  My hair doesn&#x27;t have that weighted down feeling that I would get with other products.  I also like the fresh fragrance!  I absolutely love these products and will continue to buy them in the future.</li>
            <li> I can not speak as to the health aspects, but as a conditioner it does not work any better than any other natural health food store conditioner at less than half the price.</li>
            <li> I am so impressed! I have always bought cheap shampoos from the pharmacy and I figured why not try something new since I&#x27;ve loved Maple Holistics other products. The only reason I am giving this 4 stars is because of the size. I wish it was larger especially since I have to use more product since I have very long hair. I would be willing to pay more for a &amp;#34;value&amp;#34; size.</li>
            <li> Wow! Where to start on how this conditioner has totally saved my hair! First off, I have VERY long, thick hair, well past my waist. And I never cut it, so split ends are a part of life for me. I have tried MANY different natural &amp; organic conditioners that were ok, but nothing great- I refuse to put chemicals on my hair. I became so frustrated at my straw textured hair that I even used apple cider vinegar mixed with filtered water as a rinse. Combine this with nasty, hard water and you can only imagine what a total disaster my long hair was in. It would take me LITERALLY 30 minutes to comb out my hair after all this and I would lose an enormous amount of hair in the process. So I started doing olive oil hair packs once a week...MESSY! And I had to wash my hair 5 times to get all the oil out. Not time effective. I knew there had to be a better solution. So I did what I always do, got on amazon and started reading reviews. This conditioner sounded too good to be true, but I thought at this point it couldn&#x27;t get any worse-could it?! As soon as it arrived in the mail I tried it. I never put conditioner on my roots, I start applying it about 4&amp;#34; away from my roots down to the end of my hair. After towel drying my hair the true test came...could I pull the comb through the bottom 6&amp;#34; of a small section of hair without it becoming a knotted mess? I couldn&#x27;t believe it?! I was able to comb the bottom 6&amp;#34; of ALL my hair without tangles! That hadn&#x27;t happened in over 7 YEARS! I have recommended this conditioner to ALL my friends. You won&#x27;t be disappointed! If Maple Holistics ever stops making this awesome conditioner I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;ll do.</li>
            <li> I love the smell. I have very fine but thick hair. Eventually all conditioners leave my hair oily and looking like I never washed it. Most on the first use. I have been using shampoo with no conditioner for a long time. I wash my hair everyday which can make my hair a bit like straw. Which is still better than oily.  I can use this everyday and not have build up. It leaves my hair soft. I use it with Argan Oil shampoo and it works great.</li>
            <li> Bought yesterday!  Washed my hair this am following the hydrate shampoo by Maple Holistics!  Great products!  You won&#x27;t go wrong with this brand and product.  Hair is silky smooth!</li>
            <li> I bought this conditioner based on the reviews and because I have the sage dandruff shampoo. I have extremely thick hair and this conditioner was so gentle and made my hair feel so light and soft! Other conditioners I&#x27;ve owned only made my hair feel weighed down and full of chemicals but this conditioner was awesome. It has a very nice vanilla scent to it and a little goes a long way. I would definitely recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> I like this conditioner which makes my hair soft and smooth. The smell is good and the hair looks shiny after using. The reason for not giving a five star comment is that this bottle is a little bit too small and I shall soon need another bottle of it.</li>
            <li> Smells incredible &amp; really helps with dry hair. Sulfate free! great product, very pleased</li>
            <li> Awesome conditioner :) :) and Love the smell. I will def. cont. to buy/use. Thank you :)</li>
            <li> I have damaged curly hair and it always been a miss finding a good conditioner. Silk 18 has helped a lot, it leaves my hair smoother whether I wear it curly of straight,without being greasy.</li>
            <li> Truly good smelling conditioner that leaves my coarse hair feeling soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife who has very thin hair that breaks eaily. she likes it, hardly any hair in her comb and the hair feels soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had a soft and straight hair and a couple of years ago I went to blonde, I remember my hair was kind of damage and it took time to recover my smooth hair. Two weeks ago I got highlights and they bleached my hair a lot I was afraid if having the same problem. As soon as I got home I started doing research and I found this conditioners had such a good reviews, so I got it. I&#x27;ve been using it since day one and my hair is still the same, soft and smooth. It doesn&#x27;t look damage at all and my hair has the same vitality. This conditioner works wonderful!</li>
            <li> This makes my hair really soft.  I have very long and thick hair and this works better than 90% of things I have tried, but the price is good.  Leaves my hair soft, but not greasy and does not damage color treatment.</li>
            <li> I have two slight beefs with this product. One, it claims to be homeopathic. There is nothing homeopathic about this product and it is a pet peeve of mine when people throw around that term. Homeopathy is different than naturopathy. Homeopathy is a specific branch of medicine based on the theory that &amp;#34;like cures like&amp;#34;. Please know the meaning of a term before posting it on your product label. (Plus, even if they just said this product was &amp;#34;all-natural&amp;#34; or something, I&#x27;d take issue with that as well as there are definitely non-natural ingredients. But I think it&#x27;s better than most.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My second beef is that the conditioner doesn&#x27;t go very far. I have short hair (above my shoulders) and I have to use a lot more of this product than I normally do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, I will say that my hair has been softer and healthier looking and easier to manage since I started using this. And I love the scent, even though I&#x27;m sensitive to smells. This conditioner smells pleasant and I love it when I get a whiff of my hair throughout the day. Overall, I&#x27;d probably recommend it, and I&#x27;ll consider buying it again once I run out.</li>
            <li> Great silky feel and allows me to wet brush through my long hair!</li>
            <li> I have very dry frizzy curly hair which is thinning at a terrible rate. I have tried every possible conditioner ever made for my hair, expensive or cheap they never really satisfied my needs....until now.  This stuff is awesome,after the first use I knew I found something that is honesty made and does exactly what it claims to do! I just ordered the Hydrate shampoo knowing it too will be just as awesome!  I also love the price, it makes it very affordable! PS. I am adding this new comment...I submitted my review and order # and 5 days later I received a complimentary full sized bottle of this conditioner as promised..</li>
            <li> second time I bought this !&lt;br /&gt;Feel so good when I am using it ~</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical, simply because I have made many shopping mistakes online, and ended up with a product that didn&#x27;t work as well as it said it did, thus with less money, and thus with a feeling of disappointment. Also i was unsure about buying this because some natural products (such as natural bug spray) don&#x27;t work as well as they claim. After reading about this product and all the greatness it has to offer (natural ingredients that i can pronounce, no animal testing, and all the great reviews, etc.), I was intrigued, and i realized that this product might really be worth it. I have an all natural conditioner that is paraben free, sulfate free, with no dyes or artificial fragrances or dyes, AND no animal testing!! Plus the bottle is made of recycled materials, all of which are big to me. Unfortunately, the conditioner didn&#x27;t work as well as I thought it would. So I went back to using store bought, chemical filled conditioner. After receiving graduation money as a gift, I decided to invest in some good conditioner, and I am so glad I chose Silk 18! Unlike my other natural conditioner, after one use of this product I noticed dramatic differences in the texture and appearance of my hair. Not only did it feel amazingly soft, it also made it really really shiny. My sister has bleached platinum blonde hair, so I let her use it and she said it made her hair soft and reduced the appearance &amp; feel of damage! I absolutely LOVE this product, and will definitely consider purchasing another bottle when this one is gone. I also love the smell of it, it doesn&#x27;t smell fake, it smells like vanilla and natural ingredients. And IT WORKS. It is NATURAL, NO ANIMAL TESTING, and it  WORKS AMAZINGLY! And not to mention it is affordable. It is the best conditioner I have ever used. I would recommend it to anyone and everyone.</li>
            <li> I have been meaning to write this review for a while because I rarely find a product for my fine hair that I truly LOVE!  I use both the Maple Holistics shampoo and their Silk 18 conditioner and have never found anything that leaves my hair in better condition.  Previously when I visited the hairdresser for my 6 week color treatment they&#x27;d always comment on how dry my hair was even though I was using quality hair products.  That hasn&#x27;t happened once since I began using the Maple Holistics shampoo and conditioner months ago.  Thank you for these products and for Amazon that allowed me to find them and know that I will continue as a loyal customer.</li>
            <li> I color and highlight my hair which is thick and wavy. Over the summer my hair has become really brittle and dry from the sun and chlorine.  Since I&#x27;m outside so much sometimes I&#x27;ll go a couple of days without washing it - letting the chlorine just dry in my hair and then pinning it up.  I read the great reviews about Silk18 conditioner.  So far it&#x27;s made my hair a lot more manageable and soft.  I was actually able to get a comb through my hair after I got out of the shower which is a miracle.  It&#x27;s very humid where I live right now so I my hair isn&#x27;t going to look amazing (at least to me), but I can say that I can rum my fingers through my hair without them getting caught and it feels silky and soft.</li>
            <li> This is a good product, it is one of the better conditioners i have tried. Most other conditioner advise to only apply to the ends of the hair. Silk18 recommends applying from the roots and scalp to the ends. This is fantastic for hair to absorb the most. Lathering is very smooth, the product spreads well and during the rinse process my hair feels very smooth. But the problem i have with this product is its the amount i have to use. I have 4 feet of hair. When i first used the conditioner i didn&#x27;t use much and as i was applying the conditioner was not spreading to all of my hair and i was getting some friction between my hand and my hair. The second time i applied much more and in layers buti still had the same problem just not as severe.  The smell is vanilla but it wears off quick, this is not a downside.</li>
            <li> I love it! It makes my curly hair SO much more manageable. I&#x27;ve been using it all summer and love it.</li>
            <li> Made my hair softer and less frizzy!</li>
            <li> BEST conditioner I have ever used!!! Leaves hair very soft, shiny and silky feeling...awesome product!!!!</li>
            <li> Never have I ever used something so clean and dominant before in my life. The vanilla dominance is too clean and nice. I am a cologne addict and still see how great this fragrance is and the magic it does to my hair. Everything about it screams natural ingredients and my hair feels great afterwards. Never using sulfate products again.</li>
            <li> This is one of a good conditioner I have used so far. My hair feels more silky and hydrated after i started using it and i see a noticeable difference compared to other conditioner. I will say its worth trying.</li>
            <li> My hair feels like silk when using this!  I have tried many natural conditioners that weren&#x27;t impressive, but this is not one of them.  highly recommend and I will definitely be purchasing again!</li>
            <li> Let me preface by saying I have tried more conditioners than I can count on two hands (and feet!), both cheap grocery store brands and expensive beauty supply brands. This conditioner blows almost all of them out of the water, and is very reasonably priced. Not only is it much more natural and absent of harmful chemicals, but it has a very light vanilla smell that doesn&#x27;t overpower perfume/cologne and is quite soothing. It left my hair feeling extremely soft, shiny, and very healthy--which is saying a lot considering I fried the living daylights out of it by bleaching it. I started washing with a Maple Holistics shampoo for dandruff/dry scalp, condition with this for 5-15 minutes depending on how much time I have, follow it up with a detangling spray (although this conditioner does that pretty well on its own, my hair is fussy), blow dry with cool air and then straighten to seal the follicles. After a couple weeks of that my hair has gotten visibly stronger and healthier! No more yucky dandruff and it always feels very nice. I am extremely satisfied with my purchase and will be buying this one again.</li>
            <li> This is a life-changing product!  I was very skeptical for a number of reasons, but mainly because so many people with positive reviews had coarse, curly hair.  I have fine, straight, shoulder-length hair, which is naturally dark blonde, but I have been coloring for a number of years to cover the grey.  I have tried many conditioners, but most left my hair weighted down, limp, and/or oily.  For the past few years, my hair has been thinning (nothing drastic) and it has become dry and brittle towards the ends.  The first time I used this product, I wanted to run to the computer and post a glowing review, but I decided to try it a few more days, just in case. After a few more uses, I am even happier with this product!  My hair is so shiny and soft!  I&#x27;ve been using Nexus Color Assure sulfate-free shampoo for about a month, which I really like, but adding this conditioner has made a noticeable difference.  I use a a quarter-size amount and the first time, I left in for about 5 minutes.  Since then, I leave it in about 1-2 minutes and then rinse.  It comes out of the bottle thick, but dissolves into a slick, almost serum-like consistency when you rub it into the hair.  The smell is a soft vanilla, slight coconut smell and it not strong as some reviewers said.  Once my hair is dry, I cannot smell it at all.  Before this product, I was cleaning hair out of my brush every few days, and now I don&#x27;t see as much hair loss.  The only negative I have is that the bottle is fairly small, so I&#x27;m not sure how long it will last.  But you can bet, I will be purchasing this again!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the last 2 weeks Very HAPPY with the results and would recommend it to both men &amp; women</li>
            <li> This is a nice conditioner but I am not sure I would purchase it again though.  Bed head is better</li>
            <li> Nice smell and it makes my hair soft.</li>
            <li> Bought a few bottles to try it for the first time.  Every shampoo and conditioner was not working on my now dry and brittle hair.  Yes I over process my blonde locks but also life changes have made for less hormones and more dryness. I have been trying to combat the new texture of my hair and extreme dryness.  Some expensive chemically made products do work but I wanted something more natural. I love this conditioner.  I will order more and gave some to my mom to try who also loved it.  This has added more moisture to my hair.  If my hair was at a zero in how dry it is out of 10 being the best hair; I would say this product brought my hair to a 7.  I still needed to use some all day conditioner and oils to keep it hydrated, but this is the only natural conditioner I have used that actually  has worked for my hair.  Just the thought that it has helped keep it conditioned and healthy for the past 2 months is wonderful.  I do need a good shampoo as I only have the conditioner so I am only leaving this review on the conditioner.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful.  Makes my hair soft.  I recommend.</li>
            <li> First let me say that this is literally the best company that I have ever dealt with.  They truly care about their customers and what we think of their product.  I wish that more companies would pay attention to their business model!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, to the product… The reason that I bought this conditioner was because I had just gotten my hair professionally colored and I wanted  a way to make the color last.  Also. another reason (and probably why most people are even looking at this product) is because you are sick of detergents and other odd chemicals being put into hair products.  The ingredients here are natural and not harmful to one&#x27;s hair -- reason enough to put serious thought into ordering this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A bit about my hair -- it is shoulder-length and very, very thick and wavy.  I have been using this conditioner for a few weeks, and it’s literally the best conditioner I’ve ever used (and believe me….I’ve used a LOT of different kinds).  It makes my hair soft without weighing it down, and increases the shine, too.  I wouldn’t say that it makes my hair silky (although my hair has rarely ever been “silky” in its life…it’s just too thick!), but it is DEFINITELY smoother.  Also, I have a feeling that the bottle will last a long time.  You truly only need the smallest amount for it to do its job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love feeling good about putting good products on my hair, and I feel even better supporting a company that cares about their customers as much as Maple Holistics does.  Customer for life!</li>
            <li> I purchased this conditioner after reading through the feedback here and I have to say this conditioner ROCKS!  I just received it yesterday and tried it for the first time today and WOW sooo soft very manageable with a light feel for such a deep conditioner.  My hair absolutely loves it.  I will be 45 in a couple of weeks and have bleached my hair most of my life so it tends to get mousy and dull and dry/brittle but it feels completely transformed after one use.  Some products start to build up after a while and lose their punch, I am hoping this does not happen with this product.  I will now go back and purchase the limited edition winter shampoo also.  I currently use Lush shampoo bars which are also nice but their conditioner needs some help.  My face/body does not look like I am as old as I am .. so I would like my hair to look younger too ... and this does the trick! It also does a nice job at taming my cowlicks (sp?) and helping my hair hold a nice smooth curl!!  I have used all sorts of very expensive salon brands and only the redken ginger &amp;#34;came close&amp;#34;.  I will be back for more .....</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this product and I was totally surprised and, of course, very happy with the results, having only used it three times.  I recently used a spray on hair lightener product, with peroxide in it.  All it did was turn my hair the color of copper and dried it out, big-time!&lt;br /&gt;So, I went online in search of a scent-free product that promised results.  I&#x27;m so happy with the results......my hair has recovered nicely from using this product for such a short period of time.  I live in Canada and we are Snowbirds, and you can be sure that I will bring a supply back home with me.  Thank you for a product that delivers what it promises and know that I will try other products in your line.</li>
            <li> Good conditioner.....leaves hair silky....I also use a mask with it but only leave it on a few minutes.  Never seem to have the time to spend 20 minutes with a mask in my hair.</li>
            <li> I love this product it changed my hair&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s hard to find a good conditioning and this one is great&lt;br /&gt;It fits my frizzy curly hair</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference after the first use!  My hair is normally dry and I had just had it colored - it was feeling like straw. I felt a major improvement after one use. You don&#x27;t need to use much, but be sure to leave it on 3-5 minutes. I&#x27;m very pleased with the results and just ordered my second bottle.</li>
            <li> So far this is my favorite conditioner. It smells great, like vanilla, and leaves my hair noticeabley silky without feeling weighed down. My only complaint is how stiff the plastic bottle is. It&#x27;s hard to squeeze out, but the product itself is fantastic.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product. It does make your hair feel like silk and it lasts until the next washing. I have had many complements on my hair now.&lt;br /&gt;Comb and brush just glide through. I highly recommend and will buy for life now.</li>
            <li> I never thought I would ever find a product that actually, really worked!&lt;br /&gt;This is it!&lt;br /&gt;For those like me who have porous, dry, damaged, frizzy hair, you need not look any further!&lt;br /&gt;This is an amazing product!&lt;br /&gt;Even with humidity this conditioner does exactly what it says it will do!&lt;br /&gt;I have unruly hair that is very high maintenance;&lt;br /&gt;Silk 18 Conditioner makes blow drying a breeze; hair dries smooth, yet the product is not heavy; hair feels clean and vibrant!&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a reason this product has won awards---&lt;br /&gt;The price is right---I&#x27;ve tried expensive products like Living Proof that didn&#x27;t help at all!&lt;br /&gt;You will love it!</li>
            <li> This stuff is liquid gold!!! I use a cheap box dye on my long hair and this just made it look so shiny and healthy and it feels and smells like heaven, too. How did I never know about this?</li>
            <li> I love that this product was !00% natural. It smells wonderful too. I think this product was a good purchase considering I have tried a couple of different brands of &amp;#34;Natural&amp;#34; hair products. My only issue is that my hair is not only curly but long. I tried to use it sparingly because I didnt want to go through it so fast. I let it sit in my hair for a while and even used it as a leave in conditioner sometimes. It leaves my hair manageable and awesomely scented. I think the downfall is the price for the amount. Because it is a natural product I do understand the justification but if you have long hair or if you need to wash your hair often, you will definitely go through this bottle rather quickly.</li>
            <li> This conditioner not only seal my ends on my hair, but it uses natural ingredients to make it smooth! I can finally find a product that is both natural and works effectively to seal my dry ends. Thank you Maple Holistics!</li>
            <li> I ordered this conditioner along with their argan oil shampoo and the two of them together are a winning combination. I had been a devoted customer of Pantene products but after one use I was hooked. My hair went from being dull and frizzy to silky with the right amount of volume. I have stubborn hair to begin with so there was still some frizz but it was much more manageable and healthy looking. In addition, using this combination of products is saving me so much more time because I&#x27;m washing my hair a lot less. With Pantene I was going maybe 1-2 days before the roots appeared greasy but now I&#x27;m getting 3-4. I definitely plan on buying this again.</li>
            <li> this product is really good i have a curly hair it makes my hair soft and shine and actually i l have a nice curl  from that.</li>
            <li> Amazing product.  This conditioner saved my hair!  It has not felt so soft and strong in years!  Thank you thank you thank you!!</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this conditioner! The reviews were so great, I thought that this might actually be THE ONE, but alas, it was not meant to be. My very fine hair is tricky. It&#x27;s color treated, so it needs a lot of moisture. But because it&#x27;s fine, it gets weighed down very easily. This conditioner feels good at first, but after 8-12 hours, my hair starts to look and feel greasy. The one great thing is that it smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> At first, I was skeptical because usually things that tout that they&#x27;re &amp;#34;holistic&amp;#34; are crap. But this conditioner is amazing! I&#x27;m a woman of color with naturally kinky hair, and this conditioner helped with my damaged hair and split ends. It&#x27;s really wonderful!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful conditioner.  My hair is color treated, somewhat thin,a bit dry and tends to frizz.  After my first use my hair has a silkiness it only has after being at the hair salon.  The usual little frizzy hairs that go wild in the Midwest humidity are much tamer than normal.  I find the scent very mild and pleasant.  I love this stuff and wish there was a larger and more economical size.  In the meantime I guess I&#x27;ll use it on special occasions!</li>
            <li> The stuff is not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Amazing conditioner. Has the clean smell and viscosity of much more expensive, un-natural conditioners, but it Natural! Truly cannot be beaten, and I have run the gamut on natural conditioners. Will be buying again, possibly for life.</li>
            <li> Just tried it with a Neutrogena shampoo and it worked pretty well considering the fact that the Neutrogena shampoo is a dandruff shampoo and it usually dries out my hair a lot. I will try it with a different shampoo and update.</li>
            <li> This was a great conditioner and left my hair soft and shiny.  The scent is not too strong which I also like.  My hair is very long and fine and this did not weigh it down.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product!! Use it as a hair masque and it does wonders for my dry over processed lochs!!</li>
            <li> I have been trying to reduce the sulphate use on my hair. Trying to be more of organic in the cosmetic department too. This conditioner, is not only sulphate or any other chemical free, but also has amino acids and proteins that make my hair smooth. I would not say frizz free, however, the frizz does die down for 2-3 days. The star earning quality of this conditioner is the fragrance. It is warm, soothing vanilla that just helps me relax. It is not too much, only subtle hints all the way. The fragrance lasts on the hair for 2-3 days.  I use it in combination with Sage Shampoo for Heavy Dandruff from Maple Holistics.  Overall. a very good conditioner and I have been hooked on, ever since the 1st use!</li>
            <li> I love the shampoo of this type and decided to try the conditioner too, but find it&#x27;s a bit much for my fine thin hair.  Perhaps it&#x27;s the combination of both on my hair, but it ends up being too much of a good thing for me.  I love that the shampoo makes my hair soft and healthy feeling and I still have good body for my styling, but when I added the conditioner too, my hair wouldn&#x27;t hold the fluffy style I need.  It was just too soft.  Now for some people this would be the best thing ever.  I can imagine that if you have thick coarse hair you would swoon to have it soft and silky and I&#x27;ll bet this would do just that.  Sadly, though, with my fine short hair I got more of a limp result.  Guess this conditioner is not for me, so I&#x27;ll pass it along to my daughter whose hair would benefit from it and just stick with the shampoo.</li>
            <li> I buy a lot of stuff from Amazon but never feel obligated to leave a review because nothing has impressed me like this before. A little hair background, I&#x27;m an indian, 19/f, and my hair is something I wouldn&#x27;t wish on my worst enemy. It&#x27;s corkscrew curly, it&#x27;s worst enemy is humidity, and it&#x27;s damaged. I had it chemically straightened months ago and lost half my hair to it and I pretty much lost hope of having touchable, smooth hair. I came across this product. I don&#x27;t know how. I was wary because not a single product has worked for me. But I said screw it, why not? I ordered it (this conditioner and the shampoo), got it two days later, and used them the moment they was delivered. I was astounded. For the first time, my hair wasn&#x27;t frizzy. It was soft. And the conditioner made it smell like magic. And it wasn&#x27;t as curly as it usually gets, which is also a miracle. I didn&#x27;t have to even use a straightener! I always have to just to tame it, and obviously that causes hair loss too. So worth the money, so worth it. This is gonna be my shampoo/conditioner from now on!&lt;br /&gt;I will update in a couple months so that I can update on the results.</li>
            <li> Great conditioner for getting out knots and making hair smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> Now that I have used this conditioner a few times, I must say I love it!  Really leaves my hair silky smooth and soft.  The bottle is a bit hard for old hands to squeeze, but not a deal breaker.  Would give it a 5 star if the price was a bit lower on this size bottle.  Regardless,  great product, delivered promptly.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> it is good, making my hair silky!</li>
            <li> I have dry scalp and dry curly hair. I wash my hair twice a week. This product has done wonders for my dry scalp and conditions my hair without weighing it down. I also love the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Product smells pretty good and leaves hair soft. It is thicker than other conditioners i have tried. I will probably buy more. The only thing i did not like is that is very difficult to squeeze it out of the bottle. It may be better if it was on a box like those they put body scrubs. I had to open the bottle to get product out. It is also a somewhat expensive for the quantity in the bottle, but i guess one gets what pays for.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel really soft!! I Like this product</li>
            <li> Smells great and I love the natural ingredients. Great product!</li>
            <li> I really like this conditioner. I have very fine natural hair and after I get done using Silk 18 by Maple Holistics my hair feels soft and more manageable.  The other thing is that this conditioner really helps to moisturize my dry hair.  I would definitely recommend this product to others and it is worth the buy.</li>
            <li> This is a great product so far.  I have only been using is for a few days now and I am loving it.  I have tried so many different products because my hair has been fried from coloring it so many different times (and colors).  My hair does feels healthier and I can go a day without washing now!  I cant wait to try more of these products!</li>
            <li> I use Maple Holistics shampoo which I really like as it makes my hair feel  so much thicker and it feels so clean.  Silk 18 is also really nice as it has a great smell and makes my hair look so healthy and shiny. I have used many  other name products and like this product the best. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who wants their hair to look and feel healthy.</li>
            <li> I have always had frizzy hair and maintaining my hair was a nightmare to me. After much research, i stumbled upon this product on amazon. I was a bit skeptical about the claims and decided to give it a try atlast. AND I LOVED IT!!!! I could feel the difference and loved it. My hair is smoother and silkier and the mild aroma of vanilla is wonderful. Definitely worth the price!!!</li>
            <li> A beautiful, warm vanilla scent that really does leave your hair silky and moisturized. I always get compliments whenever I use this! My hair also always seems healthy and happy after as well.</li>
            <li> For the price I didn&#x27;t notice any changes</li>
            <li> I love the conditioner! But the bottle is lacking. I would give it five stars if the bottle was easier to squeeze. It&#x27;s too hard.</li>
            <li> I love the way this conditioner smells and feels on my hair and beard. It isn&#x27;t fruity, but more of a coconut scent nice enough for any man. It leaves my hair feeling soft and touchable! Works great as a &amp;#34;no poo&amp;#34; for in between days. Excellent product!</li>
            <li> Love the smell, love the product... Just need to leave the conditioner in the hair a little longer than other products.  My hair seemed to go through a dry spell, but I was using a different shampoo (common store brand), so I switched to Maple Holistic&#x27;s hydrate shampoo to see if it compliments the silk18 better.  Too soon to tell...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On another note, for those individuals with super sensitive skin, this is the product to use...</li>
            <li> I really like this conditioner a lot. I love the smell of it. It is a soft vanilla smell. It has left my hair very soft and silky after using it. I&#x27;ll definitely buy more when I run out.</li>
            <li> Amazing conditioner! Smells great and works really well. Don&#x27;t need to use too much.</li>
            <li> The conditioner works very well. The vanilla smell is powerful at first but has a calming aroma afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;18 healthy minerals, thank you!</li>
            <li> It was an amazing experience my hair need a lot of Cear and this product gave to me a lot  thank you</li>
            <li> The smell of this conditioner makes its purchase worthwhile. It is vanilla-scented and very soothing. I am constantly on the hunt for good products for naturally curly hair. My scalp recently informed me that it is allergic to sulfates. That makes my hunt all the more challenging. So, for a non-sulfate, argan and more oil, gentle conditioner, so far this one is awesome. It is great at hydrating my scalp and hair. My hair smells amazing and the components are all natural! I will be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is awesome for women with super frizzy, course hair.  I have only used it a few times and every time my hair looks better.  I can actually air dry it without having super poofy, frizzy hair.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really give me any noticeable results. Probably won&#x27;t order again.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner. It smells great and  keeps my hair super soft even when I blow dry it. I admit I first thought it was pricey but after using it I do feel it is worth it. I only wish there was a larger size available.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is AMAZING! It smells very nice and vibrant... it eventually fades once your hair dries out. I&#x27;ve been looking for the right conditioner that doesn&#x27;t irritate my eczema and this is the one! It left my hair feeling very soft and silky. Wonderful product...</li>
            <li> I have been using Silk18 for a couple months now at least and it really lives up to it&#x27;s name. When I wash my hair, I let the conditioner soak in as directed and rinsing it out is like feeling pure silk in your hair. Your fingers slide right through easily (I have very long hair) and you barely even need to comb afterwards it&#x27;s so tangle free. My hair (which was damaged) has never felt softer and the scent is amazing. Also, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> When I brought this comditioner i was very excited to use it for the first time. I thought that it got the job done wasnt great but good at making my hair very manageable and soft. Added some moisture but not as much as i had desired. So if u are looking for s good natural conditioner without harsh chemicals u should guve this one a try.... Again not great but gets the job done.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is lightweight but highly moisturizing. I have curly, highlighted hair and after switching from drugstore shampoo and conditioner to this and their Hydrate shampoo for dry hair, my hair has never looked better. It even dries frizz free with very little to no styling product!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing conditioner, along with the Argan Oil conditioner! I&#x27;m so sold on this whole line because they use natural ingredients, as well as they make my hair amazingly soft, tangle free and so much healthier! That says a lot because I&#x27;m caucasian with long course curly hair so to have a plus plus in every category is, or has been unheard of....up until now! Thank you, I&#x27;m sold, and will be buying your products from now on!</li>
            <li> Wow! One wash I can see a huge difference! Plus, the smell is amazing!</li>
            <li> This conditioner is everything it claims to be. natural ingredients, smells good, and leaves my hair siky smooth!</li>
            <li> I like the conditioner better than the shampoo. Smells nice and conditions well.</li>
            <li> Company seems genuinely invested in their product.  Smell is nice.  I have brown hair thick and somewhat course, caucasian hair, color treated with a lot of gray.  I found this product to be very oily, so much so that my hair looks and feels oily for two days after using it.  I tried twice with same results. Then I used a marginal amount which still flattened my hair but did not leave it as oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is in my locker at work, so I might use it is small amounts.  Maybe this should be marketed as an oil treatment rather than a conditioner.</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing. It smells very good but it isn&#x27;t over powering. It leaves my hair very soft and I don&#x27;t have to use a whole lot!</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair, and this reduced the frizz in just one wash! I will definitely buy again. Great, natural, good smelling product/</li>
            <li> Superb product CANNOT BE SURPASSED WITH QUALITY</li>
            <li> I seriously loved this product!  This conditioner smells amazing and I really believe it earned it&#x27;s name &amp;#34;silk!&amp;#34;  My hair feels straight and frizz free. :)  I did receive a sample of this product for free, but it doesn&#x27;t change that I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This is one of the purest and best conditioners I have ever used. My hair has not been this soft for a long time. I went to get my hair cut yesterday in an Aveda Salon by a stylist who had never cut my hair before.  She commented on how soft and silky my very long thick wavy hair is. Also, my hair is oily but since i have been using Maple Holistics Degreaser shampoo along with Silk18 my hair&#x27;s oil has balanced out to where my hair is now soft and not greasy and oily. My hair is fluffy and silky instead of flat and greasy.  I love this conditioner and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> A sample of Argan Oil Shampoo &amp; Conditioner was given to me and I absolutely loved it! It left my hair the softest it&#x27;s ever been! So when I went online to order some and that&#x27;s when I saw this product, Silk 18.  I thought to myself, if the Argan left my hair this soft surely &amp;#34;Silk&amp;#34; 18 would be even better.  I&#x27;m sorry to say, I was disappointed :( Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it&#x27;s still a good product, just not what I was expecting.  With all that said, I will continue to use these products as they are still better than what&#x27;s offered in salons.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best conditioner I have ever used. It is clean, soft, and has very pleasant vanilla aroma, and unlike other conditioners that take forever to wash off, this conditioner rinses off with ease. It leaves behind a faint but lovely vanilla aroma, so I don&#x27;t need to put on any extra fragrance when I go to work. This conditioner does not feel heavy and oily--it is light and fluffy and works perfectly for my hair, which is very thin. $16 for a conditioner that lasts about a month is pretty steep, but I have been alternating its use with a regular brand of conditioner. I can tell a huge difference between the two, and now I am thinking that it would actually be worth it to keep buying this one despite its small size and cost. Overall, a great conditioner that I would recommend to anyone looking for a healthy alternative and anyone with damaged, thin hair like mine!</li>
            <li> I thought this was a little pricey but after reading the reviews I decided to give it a try. I&#x27;ve only used it a few times and already notice that my hair is a lot less frizzy. Summer humidity is not good to me but this conditioner does seem to be taming my frizzy hair without making it feel oily. I also really like the way it smells. I think it smells a little like almonds. Another bonus is that it doesn&#x27;t take a ton of it to work. Now my hair is very fine and thin so I only use about a dimes worth but it just seems to go a long way. I will update this if anything changes but so far so good. (Crossed fingers)</li>
            <li> very good cont. leaves hair very soft and it last longer than other cont. ive used.</li>
            <li> Soft healthy silky hair!  I get a lot of compliments on how great my hair is all e time.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT. SMELLS GREAT. FAST SHIPPING!</li>
            <li> Smells like something you want to eat so I love using it for that reason alone, but it also conditions so well and without having to use half the bottle. I have naturally curly haor that is really thick and down to my shoulders so conditioning is an absolute must and this stuff made me sublimely happy.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It truly made my hair very soft with great shine and very manageable. My hair is much easier to comb through and have noticed less breakage. I&#x27;m very interested in trying out their other products.</li>
            <li> Best conditioner ever. I get compliments all the time.</li>
            <li> I would definitely give this product five stars! It&#x27;s a top quality conditioner that instantly revatilizes my curls, gives my hair an insane amount of moisture, softness and shine. I recommend this conditioner to everyone because it works for all hair types, and the smells rocks too! ;)</li>
            <li> This conditioner is awesome!!  It smells fantastic and leaves my hair feeling soft and silky.  I love that it is sulfate free.  I will never use another conditioner again!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this products for 2 months and I comfirmed that Silk 18 Natural Conditioner repairs my dameged hair very quickly. Before start using this one, I had a lot of split end of hairs, now I have only few. Thank you Maple Holistics and I will buy it again!!</li>
            <li> This product honestly is amazing! With just one use, my hair felt brand new, silky, shiny &amp; healthy. It was absolutley amazing.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this conditioner! It does everything it promises! Ordering more😊.</li>
            <li> I really liked both the product and the speed at which the product was delivered. It came on time, and seems to be just as advertised. I&#x27;ve only been using the product for a couple days, but I already love how it smells. I feel like it can only get better at this point. In terms of how my hair feels, I enjoy knowing that I&#x27;m not using artificial chemicals on it.</li>
            <li> I tried many conditioners. This is the only one that keeps my hair controllable.</li>
            <li> Been using this for the last two months and it is really amazing. I wanted to move to sulfate free products to protect my hair color and found Maple Holistics and I won&#x27;t be using any other products on my hair. I am also now hooked on finding other natural products to replace the my current ones. This conditioner leaves my thick, coarse, chemically treated hair soft and silky without being heavy, in fact I use far less of this conditioner than I did with my previous conditioners. I also noticed since using this that my hair dries faster, whether blow or air drying which for my super thick hair is something! Still trying to pin down the right shampoo from there line that works for my dandruff but I think the Sage is going to be the winner :D</li>
            <li> A small dot on my finger each morning (I have short hair) and my hair is in amazing shape in 10 days.</li>
            <li> for long time my hair hasn&#x27;t been that soft after I used this product . this is raly a good product made my hair very soft and not too much falling. I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Smell is amazing, and it conditions my hair without weighing it down. Plus so natural! A+!</li>
            <li> This worked great on my hair!  I love it!</li>
            <li> It smells good, leaves hair soft, silky, and fresh.  It gets the job done.  It is much better than those store bought brands as they are full of toxins.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This stuff is just fantastic... It smells like HEAVEN and is the perfect compliment after using their natural Argon shampoo which I have purchased as well.  The smell and feel this conditioner leaves is incredible and very lasting.  The conditioner itself is very thick compared to others I have tried.  I will continue to use this product!!</li>
            <li> It helps mending for my dry end hair without weighting down my hair. So, I can&#x27;t complaint about the product.  But, it has very strong smell.  I don&#x27;t know how to describe the smell. It said hint of Vanilla, but I am not so sure about that. If it is, it is mixed with other smell.  But regardless of the what scent it has, it is just too strong enough to give me a headache.  I wouldn&#x27;t go as far as it give out bad odor, but it is just too strong.  Even after dry my hair, people around me ask what I am wearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  May 2016&lt;br /&gt;I received this product from seller for review, but I didn&#x27;t realized it was same one that I bought while back.  My rating still remain same.  But, I wanted to make sure since my first purchase of this product, over a year later, I received same product for review purpose again. So, I wanted to put disclaimer.  All my reviews and star rating on the items are truthful and unbiased.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product.  Great for my short, fine hair.  Leaves it feeling silky, but not weighted down.  Love it!!!</li>
            <li> I was thinking about how many positive reviews this product received.  I think the reviews are probably artificially inflated considering that the brand isn&#x27;t really well known.  I was suckered in by that.&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s nothing exceptional about this conditioner.  And it stinks.  I  will likely throw it away.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner!  I have very fine and thin hair; most often my hair felt blah.  After using this conditioner, my hair is shinier, less split ends and it looks good strait.  I would recommend this conditioner and plan on purchasing more in the future.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by this conditioner. I have thick, coarse, very long hair and this helped me manage it tremendously and tamed my frizzes. It has a nice vanilla scent that is not overpowering. I have bleached blonde hair and this has not stripped the color away. I like to leave it on and wash my body/shave to let it soak into my hair for a few minutes. Then I rinse with cold water. The only con is the size of the bottle. I go through the bottle fairly quickly due to my long, thick hair. Luckily, you only need to use a small amount. It would be nice if they had larger sized bottles.</li>
            <li> If I could give it 0 starts I would. This did only keep my hair greasy but it dried out my hair so bad i was having a hard time brushing my hair!</li>
            <li> leave in? Soak? Rinse? Who knows?</li>
            <li> I LOVE this conditioner. It has made my hair so much more manageable in terms of smoother and less tangled. I have curly frizzy hair, and it&#x27;s been increasingly difficult to manage the tangles after I wash my hair.  I also purchased the sage shampoo which is cleansing but not harsh on my color treated hair!</li>
            <li> This is not a vegan product. This product contains silk amino acids and the majority of silk production is &amp;#34;not vegan and not cruelty free&amp;#34;. The majority of silk production is not vegan and not ethically harvested. Silk comes from the &amp;#34;killed&amp;#34; larvae of silk moths. The large in the cocoons are boiled to death so that the cocoon bodies unravel to produce the silk. Not only are thousands and thousands of larvae killed in the process but silk worms have been inbred for so long that they cannot fly anymore and do not exist in the wild.  There are a &amp;#34;few places” that are recently obtaining silk ethically but it is “very&amp;#34; expensive: ex: Ahimsa silk also called Peace Silk from India. At ca. $13/bottle, ask the company where they get their silk. Again: It is definitely not vegan: Read the Product description: &amp;#34;Literally from the silkworm during its process of creating silk....&amp;#34; Whether is it vegetarian and ethically raised, ask the the company where they get their silk protein.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t use a conditioner because it causes my hair oily, but Silk 18 doesn&#x27;t cause my hair oily. I also like the smell. It has a very nice vanilla smell. The best of it is only last one day, and not like other chemical brands that smell can be last forever. Only one down side for me is the feeling of my hair after using it. My hair feels so silky but I guess that is the whole point of Silk 18. The good thing is the silky feeling didn&#x27;t last long as well but leaves my hair soft until next wash. Also, I only need to use a very small amount of it for my thick and long hair. One bottle will be last a long time. Overall, it is a good buy!!</li>
            <li> Does the job.  Great smell.</li>
            <li> Helps my dandruff a lot! After showering, I use to just have a terrible day of flakes. Not anymore! This in combination with the Sage Shampoo has really helped me. I cannot reccommend this enough.</li>
            <li> WOW!  My hair is dry and very freezy.. after one use my hair looks healthy, shinny and beautiful! I am using it as a leave-in and getting salon results at home. The best conditioner I have ever tried!  Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> I have never used a better conditioner. My hair is extremely dry and brittle and this conditioner revived it. The smell is so amazing it reminds me of amaretto and French vanilla coffee. I will definitely be making another purchase.</li>
            <li> Unless you&#x27;re hell-bent on completely natural products, it&#x27;s no better than anything you could by at walmart. It didn&#x27;t do much for my hair and I&#x27;m honestly pretty disappointed.</li>
            <li> LOVE this conditioner! Leaves my hair silky and soft for days!</li>
            <li> Fantastic!  Leaves my hair very soft and silky.  I&#x27;ll buy this shampoo and conditioner again.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s decently moisturizing but not at all greasy. and guys? it. smells. amazing. not too expensive, good for daily use... definitely recommend it. bonus: it came so quick i was honestly blown away.</li>
            <li> This stuff rocks! My hair has so much more volume and bounce to it and seems to catch the light better, giving my hair a depth of color and texture that it didn&#x27;t have before with storebought conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is a really nice vanilla that doesn&#x27;t stick around after the shower is over; your hair will be natural-smelling once it dries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little bit goes a long way, I could see this bottle easily lasting months. It helps to use a wide-toothed comb in the shower to pull the product through your hair evenly. I will second the advice of other reviewers here to rinse with cold water!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, highly recommended product and seller.</li>
            <li> not worth the money. useless product. plz don&#x27;t buy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write a review but this time I decided to. It is indeed the BEST conditioner I&#x27;ve ever tried! It makes my hair smooth and light and shiny. It would be perfect if you can offer a fragrance-free version. Have recommended it to a friend and she just placed an order!</li>
            <li> One of the best natural conditioners out there. I use it with the shampoo for the oily hair from Maple Holistics.  Keeps my hair soft, well hydrated without weighing it down or making it greasy.  Excellent!</li>
            <li> Shockingly great on my relaxed african American hair</li>
            <li> My regular conditioner (tresseme platinum strength) works better than this.&lt;br /&gt;With this i have to pour out a large amount since it doesn&#x27;t have as much slickness, and i feel like i pull my hair out when i brush it through with my fingers.. The smell is so-so; its a strong vanilla scent, but has a certain touch to it where it smells like a vanilla candle.&lt;br /&gt;I was very excited for this product, hoping it would help with my damaged hair, but ive found that applying coconut oil and shea butter to the ends of my hair after a shower worked the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dont waste your money, or if you do buy it on ebay new for $13.</li>
            <li> First use and I already see AMAZING RESULTS!! It turned my 35 year old dry brittle hair back to my soft silkie 20 yrs old hair!!! LOVE!</li>
            <li> Feels great in my hair and it smells great too!</li>
            <li> The conditioner itself may be okay. I can&#x27;t get past the horribly strong &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34; of vanilla. It smells artificial and un-natural and just WAY too strong!!! I wasted my money, since I won&#x27;t be able to tolerate the smell. Even my husband couldn&#x27;t stand it.. so I ended up having to rewash my hair to get the &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34; out. If you like everyone to be able to smell you when you walk into room then you&#x27;ll probably love this. . and of course you must like vanilla a lot! I am a fan of all things truly &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; and can&#x27;t do artificial.. if you are sensitive at all I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Now that I have been using Silk 18 for a while (on my third bottle), I can now say that it is the best conditioner I have ever used. I have tried everything and every brand, and this conditioner does wonders for my hair. I am 64, and it makes my long hair soft and shiny. May be a little expensive, but it is worth the cost.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through one bottle of this product, and still love it.  It conditions my hair and leaves it (almost) silky.  I&#x27;ve used the hair salon products - Nexxus, Nioxin, Paul Mitchell - these products work well for a week or so, but unfortunately, the tips of my hair then start getting dry and brittle, and for some reason the products aren&#x27;t effective for long-term use.  This conditioner smells great, and does moisturize.  My hair feels much smoother.  It would be great if this came in a bigger bottle - 1 bottle lasted me 3 weeks with daily use.</li>
            <li> I recently ordered this product after reading positive reviews on here. I have to say, after one use I am very satisfied. I have dry, frizzy hair and was left with soft, healthy, bouncy curls after leaving it on in the shower for a few minutes. I am happy with the ingredients, which I can pronounce and with the way it left my hair feeling and smelling! Just a faint hint of vanilla. I don&#x27;t like to wash my hair on a daily basis and after two days, my hair has lost all that moisture. I will he happy, however, to recondition with this product.</li>
            <li> Smells nice, but honestly my thin curly hair did not really benefit from this conditioner. It did NOTHING for tangled hair and didn&#x27;t really help with frizz either...</li>
            <li> Tried this stuff on a whim. I have blue hair that is extremely hard to keep blue. I decided to switch to an all natural conditioner thinking it would help. It has. This stuff has also made my hair so soft. I can&#x27;t stop touching it. This has a very light vanilla scent. I found my new conditioner!</li>
            <li> Love it.  Leaves hair so smooth smells nice!!</li>
            <li> It is not moisturizing enough for normal and healthy hairs.</li>
            <li> After a horrible time desperately bleaching an unintended color out of my hair, I was pretty upset to see my hair an acceptable color, but elastic, damaged and rough. You couldn&#x27;t even run your fingers through it happily when it was DRY. It was disgusting and I was petrified thinking I&#x27;d have to chop it all off. I bought this product on a whim and I&#x27;m extremely impressed. I washed it four times during the week and already my hair is healthier. It has valiantly fought through my abuse with the help of this product, and I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li> These products are really nice for my hair. I&#x27;d recommend them to anyone.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the feeling i get after using the conditioner. I Had bought both the shampoo and the conditioner the shampoo i wasn&#x27;t too fond of, but once i used the conditioner it left my hair so nice and soft and even the smell of is pretty nice. I Would Definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> This conditioner did wonders on my hair in just one use.  I love this stuff my hairs so soft and has  reduced the look of damage in my hair :)</li>
            <li> Smelled good, did good job moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Awesome!  I used this after the Argon Shampoo.  The smell is beyond divine.  It is very creamy and leaves my hair super shiny and soft.  I love that I can use a natural conditioner and get these results.  I think it is a great value for the money.  I&#x27;ll be using this for a long time!</li>
            <li> This is absolutely miraculous. After dying my hair for the first time, so much of it fell out. I switched to what I thought was a natural shampoo and conditioner brand, but it was not. It had synthetic fragrance, and even more of my hair fell out, my scalp started to peel, and it was inflamed. Then, I found this conditioner and the Argan shampoo by Maple Holistics as well, and after just one wash, I was impressed. Now, after 2 washes, my hair feels as soft as my 7 year olds, and get this--I don&#x27;t even have to blow it dry for it to look nice. I have crazy hair that needs to be blown out or straightened, and it dries on its own with Silk 18, looking soft and healthy. I don&#x27;t know how they do it because there is no build up or greasy residue. I feel like I have soft child hair, and I already see new hair sprouting and no more flakes. Please keep the prices low, as this is the best conditioner (and shampoo) I&#x27;ve ever used in my life!!! I feel compelled to stock up and hoard it; it&#x27;s that good!</li>
            <li> Not only is it affordable, it&#x27;s a great product! I have naturally curly/wavy hair and it made my hair extremely soft. Love the smell and quality. Great buy!</li>
            <li> I have very fine, thin hair, relatively short.  It is difficult to find conditioner that doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;weigh down&amp;#34; my hair  and cause it to look flat.  I used the Silk 18 conditioner after shampooing with argan special formula shampoo for two mornings in a row now.  I love the lather of the argan shampoo and the fact it doesn&#x27;t have much scent.  I prefer unscented products, but very light scent is ok.  I love the texture and slight vanilla smell of the Silk 18 conditioner and how silky it makes my hair feel. I like that they are sulfate free.  I like my hair swingy and these products fit the bill.  I will buy the again!  Thank you for a great product line.</li>
            <li> i love it my hair become good .no loss</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!!!! I have been looking for a conditioner that doesn&#x27;t weight down my hair or make it greasy. This stuff is the best! I condition daily and wash every 3 days so non greasy is a must have for me. Silk 18 is the best conditioner I have ever used. I will buy again!</li>
            <li> My hair is dry and brittle. Typically, after washing and conditioning, my hair feels stiff when wet and difficult to comb through. My first time using this conditioner my hair was pliable when wet and I wasn&#x27;t left with a handful of hair after combing. This conditioner has helped my hair stay moisturized and has reduced fly-aways.</li>
            <li> I have dry curly hair which is also colored and highlighted. My hair does not like silicones because they leave my hair greasy and break my scalp out. I was using Color Proof before I found this but it broke my scalp out because it was laden with cones so I started looking for an affordable natural product that made my dry hair soft and did not have cones. I came across this conditioner on Amazon and decided to give it a try with all the positive reviews. I am not disappointed.  I have been using this and it has made my hair feel better than other high end brands that I have tried such as Living Proof, Alterna, Color Proof, Redken, etc...... Normally if I blow dry and straighten my hair, it will feel very dry afterwards but I just had silky hair with this conditioner. It also smells wonderful like natural vanilla beans and rinses clean. I am truly impressed and for the price it can&#x27;t be beat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updated:&lt;br /&gt;The more I use this conditioner,  the more I love it. My hair literally feels like silk and I have not had a single breakout on my scalp or neck since using this. Maple Holistics has excellent customer service and I just went through my cabinets and got rid of all the half used hair products that I had been saving. My hair has never felt greasy either.</li>
            <li> I only used this 2 times and my dry hair suddenly got softer, shinier and healthier!!!!! The vanilla scent is alright too, sweet and not too strong. I would recommend making a larger size though so I won&#x27;t have to purchase this multiple times in the future. Overall, I&#x27;m really really glad I found this product!!</li>
            <li> My step daughter purchased this product as a gift for me; and the slip is amazing.  The product can be applied to the hair so smoothly.</li>
            <li> This stuff, jeez. I was SO excited to find a a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; conditioner that would make my frizzy, out-of control hair be somewhat more manageable, and it did...but the reason it worked truly sucked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. This product is not 100% natural. Check out the answer in the Q&amp;A section about ingredients and be sure to expand it (I didn&#x27;t before my purchase, which was a mistake). Things like &amp;#34;Natural Vanilla Fragrance, Panthenol, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Phenoxyethanol, Potassium Sorbate&amp;#34; are not natural, and some aren&#x27;t exactly good for you either.&lt;br /&gt;2. Yeah it makes your hair more manageable, because it strips it. May have just been me, I don&#x27;t know, but my thick strands became so thin it was outrageous. And it was so noticeable because I usually wear my hair up in clips (instead of bands) and it would slip out.&lt;br /&gt;3. Finally, and this was the deal-breaker for me, it actively made my hair fall out--though only in the shower while rinsing. I did tests using it with different shampoos, replaced it with another conditioner and then tried it again (just to see if I was crazy), but no. This conditioner made my hair fall out in clumps. Clumps! If you&#x27;ve ever dyed your hair at home, you&#x27;ll know what I mean when I say it was exactly like after that first wash; strands simply ran from my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So yes, it did make my hair feel nice (silky) and it was more manageable BUT there are risks it seems.</li>
            <li> I was concerned if all the positive reviews were legit.... Have used this now for 2 weeks and am impressed!  It is a really thick product, a little hard to get just the right amount out of the bottle. Was concerned that it would weigh my hair down, but it didn&#x27;t. I have fine hair, but a lot of it, so it&#x27;s hard to find just the right conditioner. Seems to help with frizz. A friend actually commented that my hair looked really good. Love the fact that it has natural ingredients. Would purchase again, and curious to try their other products.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of course, dry hair and it used to take quite a bit of product to make it look shiny and moisturized. During pregnancy and breastfeeding, I went completely natural and toxin free. I tried more than a fair share of products for my hair and am so, so happy that I came upon this conditioner. I do not like a product with unnatural fragrance in it as I am sensitive to it and do not want my baby to be around it at all. This conditioner has a very natural vanilla scent to it that does not bother me at all. I actually really like it. It sort of relaxes me in the shower.  As far as application - it has a nice, thick consistency, yet it spreads nicely through my long, thick hair. I use a decent, but not too big amount, start on my ends and work my way up, then comb it through and leave on for a couple minutes. With previous conditioners, my hair either felt weighed down or felt completely parched and dry. This one leaves my hair pretty silky and moisturized. I still have to put some natural product in my hair before letting it dry, but I expect that.Out of all of the safe and natural conditioners I have tried, it is the best I have found so far. I have only tried the conditioner and am planning on purchasing again as well as trying a shampoo from Maple Holistics. The only issue I have that almost made me give it 4 instead of 5 stars is that the bottle doesn&#x27;t give you a whole lot for the price. Considering I only wash my hair 3 times a week, though, it has lasted me longer than it would for most people.  I&#x27;d love if there were more in the bottle, but, for now, I will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> This conditioner works very well on thin (not thinning, but thin) hair.  It is light, yet very effective.  Makes my hair soft and very shinny.  Best thing about it is that it gets rid of static electricity that tends to be abundant in my home for some reason.  I love the product, I only wish it were more affordable.</li>
            <li> wonderful wonderful stuff. i am so happy i ordered this. my hair is so soft and shiny, and it helped with the frizziness with the first use. i can&#x27;t wait to see how much better my hair gets with continued use</li>
            <li> This is a great product, it makes my hair soft and shiny. I highly recommend this product for dry and damaged hair.</li>
            <li> WOW!  Unbelievably Good!  Absolutely the best conditioner (and shampoo)  I&#x27;ve ever used.  Transformed my fine, dry, color treated frizz back into soft, shiny, silky strands.  Even restored body and fullness.  My hair looks 15 years younger.  My advice to you - try Silk 18.  If your results are anything like mine, you&#x27;ll be a customer for life.  And your satisfaction is 100% guaranteed by Maple Holistics.</li>
            <li> Have used and it hydrates your hair and smells very good.</li>
            <li> This is a great product I have used it for a few years now and it has really improved my hair! Feels super smooth.</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair and this product is a must in my shower routine!!!! I love the smell also.</li>
            <li> This smells great. My hair is naturally curly, dry and frizzy. but after using this product my hair is so soft and silky (beyond my imagination). It did not weigh down my hair at all. my hair is curly and bouncy. Its a kind of miracle for my dry and tangle prone hair. Definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> very nice conditioner. i have been using this and the Argan shampoo and love both. great light fragrance and no allgery issues - i&#x27;m sensitive to smells and have skin allergies. very pleased with the products and Maple Holistics as a seller.</li>
            <li> Smells great. Makes hair soft and silky. It&#x27;s my new standard conditioner.</li>
            <li> I purchased this along with the shampoo. I love this conditioner. It stands up to its name &#x27;Silk&#x27; and really makes my hair soft and silky. I have short wavy hair and it has a tendency of getting frizzy very quickly as soon as I leave the house. I have tried many conditioners and this is the first conditioner that seems to keep my hair under control. I dont live in a tropical humid location, but still my hair tends to get frizzy, but has done very well with this conditioner. As some other reviewers mentioned, I just need a very little amount to condition my hair. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love the smell! Works great too!</li>
            <li> I have major issues with my hair!  I have been coloring it for years, flat ironing and blow drying daily, and it has taken a toll.  My hair is dry, frizzy, damaged and breaks off very easily.  I have tried several conditioners but have to say that I am extremely pleased to have found this product.  I&#x27;m thrilled that it&#x27;s sulfate free because I know it won&#x27;t compromise my hair coloring.  I use it in the shower after shampooing on a daily basis, and then I use it twice a week as a deep conditioning treatment by wetting my hair with warm water, covering all my hair with the product, brush it through and then wrap it in a warm damp towel.  I have seen major differences in the last two months since using this product, my hair is soft, smooth, and much less brittle...I don&#x27;t feel as guilty using my flat-iron everyday because this product supplies my hair with plenty of moisture!  The product is VERY reasonably priced for the results that it gives!  I would highly recommend this product if your hair is in rough shape...you will see results!</li>
            <li> The only way to explain this conditioner is AMAZING! I have extremely  dry hair and this condition completely turned my hair around after one use! I will definitely be reordering. If you have curly hair it will definitely define and enhance your curls.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS! My hair always has a faint vanilla smell to it now which I love because I get a whiff of it every now &amp; then.  It&#x27;s not an overbearing smell, it&#x27;s just right! Also, I am very sensitive to EVERTHING but this doesn&#x27;t give me any kind of irritation or any other bothersome outcome</li>
            <li> The smell is amazing, but the reviews I received at work the next day were even better!  First time I have had frizz free hair that looked like I had just done a perfect perm!!! It was bouncy and held the curl better than ever before.  I have curly, dry, color treated hair.  I will be stocking up on this product .</li>
            <li> Love Love Silk 18.  I live in a city that has very hard water.  This conditioner makes my hair very shiny and silky.  This is my second bottle.  If you need a great conditioner at a great price, don&#x27;t hesitate to try Silk 18..</li>
            <li> A nice conditioner. Didn&#x27;t weigh my hair down. Hoping it repairs with regular use. Combined with the Tea Tree Oil Shampoo with rosemary and lavender, a clean fresh soft feeling.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair extremely soft and look much healthier. I dye my hair frequently and this conditioner really helps to bring it out of its straw-like state! Very hydrating but not too heavy - doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy the day after I wash it!</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner . I have fine curly hair and this made my hair smooth and manageable . Combs out easily and feels hydrated.</li>
            <li> Love the product... But mine exploded in the mail so the whole bottle was gooey and slimy and a bit of the product was missing because of that... but it&#x27;s a great product my hair loves it.</li>
            <li> The vanilla aroma like others said is so good smelling. This did leave my color treated hair soft and I love that it is all natural. I would definitely  purchase this again and it is affordable considering all the good ingredients in it. If possible it might be good to also have a bigger size with a pump also at a reasonable price (around $20).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been pleasantly surprised by this conditioner.  I purchased this along with the Sage Dandruff Shampoo, also by Maple Holistics.  Honestly, I didn&#x27;t have huge expectations because my experience with &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; beauty products hasn&#x27;t been great.  Plus, I&#x27;ve always had a hard time finding a product that works well with my thick, wavy, frizzy East Asian hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I don&#x27;t use any styling products in my hair or blow dry my hair.  I&#x27;ll make an exception for special events, but my general routine is to just wash and go (I&#x27;m a busy mom!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This conditioner works surprisingly well on my thick, frizzy hair.  Even after air drying, my hair is still soft and smooth, as if I put silicone in it.  I&#x27;m particularly happy that I can get these results from a natural conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only cons:&lt;br /&gt;- This conditioner has a slight vanilla smell.  I usually don&#x27;t like vanilla scent in beauty products, but it&#x27;s so light that it doesn&#x27;t bother me too much.  I definitely like the Sage shampoo scent better.&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s expensive.</li>
            <li> this is the best conditioner I have ever used. My hair is so dry and this allows me to comb it straight out of the shower.......never happened before. I love this conditioner.</li>
            <li> Best stuff I have ever used...can&#x27;t wait to try the shampoo.  I will be ordering this again and again and the price is not bad at all for this quality product.  The conditioner smells more like root beer than vanilla scent, but i love it anyway!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite conditioner. I&#x27;ve used Alterna at $30+ a bottle, that Ojon stuff that dried out my hair, Wen, ugh, there&#x27;s been so many and this... THIS conditioner by Maple Holistics is by far my favorite! It doesn&#x27;t contain any harsh ingredients, it smells wonderful and leaves my hair super soft without weighing it down or making it feel sticky. I LOVE it! I have very thick hair that is wavy and this leaves my hair feeling like silk! I would definitely recommend this</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for a couple weeks now, and my hair is much shinier and soft and all around healthier! Very happy with this product, I would recommend it!</li>
            <li> This shampoo will be the most amazing thing you have put in your hair for the first month! It left my hair so silky and soft. Not only silky and soft, but I smelled of vanilla the entire day! Now that I am nearly done with the bottle, my hair is not as soft as it used to be. My fingers don&#x27;t run through my hair as smoothly as they did. I still love it and will continue to use it because my hair still feels MUCH BETTER when compared to other conditioners I have used.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair, and I like to wear it long and curled. Both the &amp;#34;long&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;curled&amp;#34; present challenges because it can look dried out from the curling iron, and then it can break and look thin and scraggly. I have to be careful of conditioners too, because while I want smoothness and shine, and easy wet-combing, most conditioners weigh my hair down and make it look flat, even though I know not to put it on my scalp. I know it&#x27;s possible to get the look I want though, because my hair looks pretty good coming out of the salon - but with those products it goes flat in a day or so. So -- I tried this -- I am already hooked! My hair looks shiny, healthy and bouncy ... and it did not go flat even after two days! I squeezed out the water after shampooing, put in the conditioner, waited about 2 minutes then rinsed thoroughly. My hair felt soft and silky, but not too soft to hold a curl with my usual styling routine (which includes a styling product). Love this stuff and definitely will buy it again!! Thank you!</li>
            <li> This is the best moisturizing conditioner I&#x27;ve used. I&#x27;ve tried several conditioners that were much more expensive but this tops them all. I use a separate protein conditioner and sometimes it makes my hair hard so I follow with this moisturizing conditioner and my hair is soft and there&#x27;s no dryness. I loooove this conditioner. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have coarse, curly hair. For years I have dyed, straightened, curled, used hair dryers, and have blown it out. I have used so many products on my hair, I try multiple throughout the year on a quest to find something that works. I was tired of having hair that didn&#x27;t actually feel like hair. At the very least I would like it to be soft; I have used multiple products just for this reason alone. It is rare for me to find something that i am satisfied with and this is one of those rare times. When I first used it, I figured it was just another fail. It didn&#x27;t feel like it was absorbing into my hair, I left it in for about five minutes while in the shower. I let my hair air dry and for the first time in years, my hair was actually soft! The smell is great and I only need a small amount. I find myself buying alot of conditioner because I use a ton each time, but with this I don&#x27;t need to worry about that. I would definitely recommend this to others!</li>
            <li> Love this!  I have very wavy color-treated hair which frizzes easily.  This conditioner works like magic.  I will be ordering again!</li>
            <li> Just started using this product recently with a DHT blocking shampoo, and I&#x27;m very impressed so far. Smells great, but more importantly, definitely leaves my hair feeling softer/smoother and looking a bit &#x27;brighter&#x27;. I don&#x27;t know if it does a better job than run of the mill conditioners like Pantene or what have you, but it definitely does the job without all those chemicals, which is what attracted me to it in the first place. The product is quite pricey, but sometimes you have to pay for the best. One minor critique would be the bottle itself, which is difficult to squeeze and control the amount of product released. Pump action would be much better.</li>
            <li> Has nice smell but nothing special.</li>
            <li> This did nothing at all for my hair. I am of mixed heritage ( black and white). I had the most difficult time trying to comb my hair out in the shower while this was still in my hair. If you have curly hair ( corkscrew type) this may not be the best for you. Glad it works so well for everyone else but I have to keep looking.</li>
            <li> I have only used this three times, but I already see a difference in how soft my hair is!  I have very long, slightly wavy, medium brown hair.  I have been looking for something with cleaner ingredients than what I had been using, but that worked well.  I am very happy I found this company.  I also like their shampoo.  This conditioner is super thick, really stays on my wet hair without dripping off while I shave my legs.  I let it sit as long as I can, while I finish doing everything else in my shower, then I rinse it off.  It also smells good too.  Just a hint of warm vanilla, not too strong.  I will definitely be re-ordering.</li>
            <li> I was searching for a good, daily conditioner for my fine hair.  As a desert dweller, my hair can dry out very quickly if not nourished properly, especially if I am out in the heat or the pool.  In addition, I keep extensions in my hair all summer.  The Silk 18 Natural Conditioner was the number one seller on Amazon, but I still read the reviews and did some research.  I am using it in the shower each time I wash my hair, and really like the application- you can tell it is being absorbed into your hair.  As a result, I will need less argon oil to keep my dry ends healthy and go longer between trims.</li>
            <li> Fantastic conditioner.  Leaves my hair silky smooth and smelling great.  Will buy again and again!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this conditioner!  I have long, fine hair and unfortunately it gets very tangly when it&#x27;s wet.  I have only found a couple of conditioners that I can use and then comb through my hair without too much trouble when it&#x27;s wet, but then I wanted to go all Natural!  So I was on the search for a Natural conditioner and Silk 18 works like a dream.  My hair is seriously silky smooth and I can comb right through it when it&#x27;s wet, and the smell is amazing!  I will continue to buy this conditioner.</li>
            <li> Been looking for good conditioner for my daughter n myself. We both have dried hair. This natural conditioner did make my hair feel light silky smooth. My only discomfort is my hair feel itchy after 1 day. But I would want to give a try to the natural shampoo.</li>
            <li> I live this conditioner. It smells amazing and moisturizes my frizzzy, wavy hair but I have noticed that it does break me out where it touches my face (jaw and sometimes around the mouth). I do have SUPER sensitive, acne prone skin, so I&#x27;m not terribly surprised, just disappointed.</li>
            <li> i have dry color treated hair and so far silk18 is making my hair soft and manageable. i had purchase numerous expensive products and so far this works, even my kids are using it.</li>
            <li> This item is listed as a low chemical product for hair. I was unable to locate the exact label with a list of ingredients prior to purchasing. I read the customer reviews and the product description. The product has more than just natural ingredients, and in fact contains potassium sorbate. Potassium sorbate damages hair, and I have been advised by my physician to avoid it. To help others who review this product, I am listing the actual ingredients: Water, Aloe Barbadenis Leaf, Cetaeryl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Chloride, Glycerin, Cetearyl Olivate, Sorbitan Livate, Phytokeratin, Proppanediol, Caprylic Capric Triglyceride, Argan Oil, Shea Butter, Certified Organic Blend Pomegranate, Hibiscus, Green Tea and Sea Buckthorn, Silk Amino Acids, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Phenoxyethanol, Potassium Sorbate. I am returning this product and plan to make my own conditioner using organic aloe vera from the organic plant, mixing it with water and spraying on my hair as a detangled</li>
            <li> Received this product today and could not wait to use it. I was super excited because I have low porosity 4c hair and the amino acids really help with moisture retention and manageability. I used it as a leave in conditioner sat under my hair steamer for about 20 minutes and BOOM manageable hair with a curl pattern. I only co washed my hair so I would like to see how it functions when I wash my hair with shampoo. Only gave it 4 stars because this was my first use however it was pretty darn good.</li>
            <li> I have many daughters with long hair and have had such a hard time finding an organic conditioner that actually works.  Not only does it work, but it smells good and for the first time in awhile my kids love getting their hair brushed! As for myself, without knowing that I started using a new conditioner, commented on how good my hair looked after just the first use!</li>
            <li> I was looking for sulfate-free hair products and read the reviews about this conditioner. I thought I&#x27;d try it and I&#x27;m glad I did. First off  I noticed the smell, it&#x27;s fantastic. And the smell last for days, I have very long hair. To say that this conditioner works wonders would be a huge understatement. My long hair is not easy to keep soft, as it is also color treated. It make my hair so soft, really touchable. This conditioner is worth three times as much.  I hope that they make a matching/similar shampoo. I love this, and have found a cruelty-free, American-made hair product that I can&#x27;t say enough good things about. Try it, you&#x27;ll be happy you did.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a natural, color-friendly conditioner to revive my overprocessed, straw-like hair.  This conditioner has those stats, and a wonderful creamy texture that seemed to absorb into the hair quicker than other products i have tried.  Smells great and serves to detangle, but does not yield any extraordinary result.  However, i will be buying it again because it is as close to chemical-free as i can find.</li>
            <li> I have found a hair conditioning product for life......I have very coarse dry hair and stumbled upon this conditioner when searching for sulfate free shampoo. I thought why not give it a try. When I received the product  I admit I was in a very doubtful state. Once I opened the bottle and that soothing vanilla fragrance permeated I quickly  thought &amp;#34;no time like the present to try this&amp;#34;. Oh my goodness! The softness and tangle-free state that it left my hair is nothing less than amazing!</li>
            <li> I have tried a million conditioners and all failed. This conditioner has made my hair so soft ! I love this stuff ! Look if your looking for a conditioner to make your hair feel like it did before you started coloring it.. Then buy this stuff . You will love how it makes your hair feel. I will be buying more !</li>
            <li> Hair looks amazing after applying this product</li>
            <li> good conditioner with affordable price indeed!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent conditioner. Most conditioners have a chemical feel to them and this one does not. I use it on my 13 inch long beard, split ends are gone and it is manageable and soft. Nice aroma, not overpowering. I will continue using Maple Holistics Silk 18.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Silk 18 for about a month and I love it.  I have naturally curly hair and finding a product I can use consistently has been difficult.  I do not use shampoo at all so, I tend to use Silk 18 sparingly, alternating with a cleansing conditioner.  The Silk 18 leaves my curls silky and bouncy.. and my hair smelling great!  But, because I don&#x27;t shampoo, if I use it too many times a week, it can start to weigh my hair down.  However, after a month of use I&#x27;m still getting consistent results, which is unique.</li>
            <li> All I can say is &amp;#34;WOW&amp;#34;.  I have never had a conditioner that made such a difference on my hair!  I was losing a lot of hair due to stress. My daughter-in-law had died and left behind a baby that was only 8 months old.  Talk about losing some hair! So I started using this product and within one week saw a reduction in the hair loss.  I am definitely going to buy a lot more of this conditioner.  It works along with any shampoo that I use.  I only use organic shampoo and organic products and this fits right in with all of my other products.</li>
            <li> I really liked this conditioner.  It has leaves a nice vanilla smell in your hair and works to loosen up your hair.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is really wonderful, I have to say I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
            <li> This conditioner was great. I was looking for a natural conditioner and found it! It left my hair really soft and easy to brush afterwards. I usually leave it in for a few minutes and rinse it out at the end of my shower.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth buying, made my hair super soft and the shuttle smell is delicious. I didn&#x27;t think it would be that great just because nothing works with my hair but this is awesome!&lt;br /&gt;Emily B.</li>
            <li> After one use, my hair is soft, silky, and shiny.  The dryness is gone.  And I got complimented by my husband!</li>
            <li> I purchased this conditioner last week. I have dry curly hair and it works amazing on my hair. It makes it soft like silk. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The conditioner made an immediate difference to my dry/frizzy hair. I have dry scalp/thin hair and this conditioner gave a good lift and volume.</li>
            <li> The best conditioner I&#x27;ve used thus far, can feel the difference from my previous conditioner to this one. Will continue with this product!</li>
            <li> Hands down, THE best conditioner I&#x27;ve used.  Very effective with extremely dry, curly hair. I&#x27;ve tried a ton of conditioners, NONE leaves the effect that Silk 18 does. I love this conditioner and what it does for my hair.  Leaves my curls hydrated and defined.  High quality conditioner.  Not heavy.  Good clean smell.  I will use this over and over again.  If you have very dry hair, I suggest you give it a try.  I&#x27;m checking out their other products as well, now that I see the quality of their product.</li>
            <li> Such a great product! I recently got this as a present and really love the way it feels on my hair. Not a lot of conditioners work well on my curly, frizzy, dry hair, but this is really different. I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be such a dramatic difference, but I&#x27;m already starting to see a change in my hair.</li>
            <li> I have only used this conditioner once so far. I received this along with my maple holistics tea tree dandruff shampoo earlier than expected, which was great. I immediately opened the package and I was delighted by the smell of this product. It smells like vanilla with a hint of coconut oil. It&#x27;s very pleasant. I used it after I colored my hair and it did a fantastic job at keeping my hair soft and smooth even after all of the stuff I had just put it through. I love that it also helps untangle my long, wavy hair. It&#x27;s incredible. I love it already, honestly. I will definitely be purchasing this again!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this! I have shoulder length, very thick wavy/curly hair that two months ago I had stripped from red to light brown with highlights. So my hair has been abused recently, but still I don&#x27;t like to use conditioners with cones in them and this is lovely. I tried it as a deep conditioner by washing my hair then applying this and leaving it on for 30 minutes. My hair felt really nice, but it didn&#x27;t make it feel any nicer than when I leave it on in the shower for a few minutes. I also put a little in a spray bottle with water and use it as a leave in. I also get migraines and some strong smells really bother me, and this is not strong smelling at all.</li>
            <li> This product allowed my hair to become more manageable than ever. I have 4c hair &amp; not all conditioners work well. Silk 18 does a great job.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is amazing! It made my hair softer than any conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used. It also works great for detangling. The product was packaged nicely and I would highly recommend ordering it!</li>
            <li> I purchased the Silk 18 along with the hydrating shampoo and I love them. I have been on the hunt for a natural shampoo and conditioner and after reading through many reviews decided upon Maple Holistics. I am especially impressed with the conditioner since my hair gets tangled easily. The Silk conditioner works great. It&#x27;s very light weight and I have found that I only need about a dime size amount for my meduim length straight hair. I run it through with my fingers and in seconds all the knots are gone and my hair feels silky smooth. The conditioner smells lovely as well like vanilla. Very pleased with this purchase!</li>
            <li> It is a very good conditioner. It untangles my hair. Leaves them silky, soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get enough of this conditioner. I am a real jerk to my hair - I blow dry and then straighten/curl every day. I&#x27;ve been trying for the longest time to find an effective natural sulfate-free conditioner that actually conditions my hair without leaving it greasy or feeling hay like. Then I found this miracle product. It&#x27;s exactly what I&#x27;ve been searching for and has no scary chemicals. It is a little pricey compared to drugstore brands, but the quality and great natural ingredients make it totally worth it.</li>
            <li> This is some good conditioner love the way it make your hair feel and smell this is some good product.</li>
            <li> I have relaxed hair. This product did not add moisture to my hair as promised. Its not worth it especially at this price.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner. I paired it with the Argan shampoo by Maple Holistics...together they left my hair soft and shiney. I will be a repeat customer.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is kind of expensive but worth every penny!!This conditioner totally changes the texture and feel to my hair. It changes it from dry and brittle, to more soft and smooth like silk. I love the scent of this product and it&#x27;s 100%natural.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner, has a wonderful fragrance and works very well for conditioning, I leave it on a little longer than normal to get the result I want. It is great that it is free of so may toxic chemicals that are in most conditioners.</li>
            <li> My hair never feels very soft until now! Omg it smells like coconut too! I love this stuff! Was using miracle7 conditioner for a while and it is nothing compared to this one. I have started getting compliments and I swear my hair has been growing since I used it. I just bleached parts of my hair too and it&#x27;s like silk. And it&#x27;s my hair!! Best product I have ever bought</li>
            <li> I love the product. It makes my hair feel soft and shiny. I love it.</li>
            <li> This is the best  conditioner I never had,</li>
            <li> Good but a little heavy for my fine hair still trying to get the right amount. I bought it for winter fly away hair . My hair is very soft and shiny when I use it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic. My hair is SUPER dry and this actually works. The only product that could get my hair soft prior to this was l&#x27;oreal&#x27;s  everpure conditioning mask, but that is full of chemicals. This is the ONLY natural conditioner I have found that actually works. I also tried their argan oil shampoo and it is equally amazing-leaves the hair clean, but soft. So glad I finally found my brand, woohoo!!</li>
            <li> I think this is a nice conditioner.  I have frizzy, curly hair and currently a bad haircut.  This conditioner smooths my wild hair considerably.  I still need a leave-in conditioner and styling product (which is why I gave 4 stars and not 5) so it&#x27;s not a miracle - but certainly better than others I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the scent.  Other reviews remarked that it was too strong.  I agree that if you stick your nose in the bottle, it is strong but if you rinse it out of your hair, I find it very pleasant.  It&#x27;s a light vanilla-ish smell.  I have a friend who is very sensitive to perfumes and she has no problems sitting next to me (after I rinse my hair with this product).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll buy this again</li>
            <li> Overall, I was most definitely 5-star pleased with this product and the company.  I received it within just a couple days of placing my order.  I didn&#x27;t use it until a couple days later as I was finishing up the last of my other conditioner.  The first time I used it was on a &#x27;wash only&#x27; day, as I shampoo only 2-3 times a week.  But wowzer!  I sure was impressed.  And then the next day when I did the shampoo followed by Silk 18, holy leaping cow - I can honestly say I LOVE this conditioner.  (In fact, I went to Maple Holistics page and ordered another bottle, along with some Argon Oil shampoo!)  Here&#x27;s a breakdown of the reasons why I&#x27;m singing its praises:&lt;br /&gt;*amount needed - I have about 22-24 inches of hair in long layers and slightly more than a quarter size amount is all I need to use.&lt;br /&gt;*the smell - fabulous!  It has a light fragrance smell that is pleasant and fresh&lt;br /&gt;*the difference in my hair - after only using it twice, I can see and feel the difference in my hair.  I&#x27;m naturally curly, therefore naturally prone to frizzy and fuzzy looking!  The last two days, however, I&#x27;ve had to use VERY LITTLE product and my hair smells great and looks healthy and has a &#x27;shine&#x27; to it.  (I use an Argon curl cream, so I&#x27;m sure going to give them a review and some of this credit!)&lt;br /&gt;*sulfate-free - my hair dresser has been on me for a long time to move to sulfate free, yet anytime I&#x27;ve tried anything s-free, I absolutely couldn&#x27;t stand it!  She&#x27;s going to love hearing about this stuff - and she buys quite regularly for her shelf products from Amazon (so I hope they keep plenty in stock!)&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, if you, like me, don&#x27;t mind spending a little extra as long as you get what your paying for, give this a try!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start by saying that I love maple holistics products.  The natural conditioner made my dead limp hair come back to life.  My hair is tricky and it seems that none of the products in the stores help. Either they make it to oily or no help at all.  I love natural products and this mh had the best. You can&#x27;t go wrong</li>
            <li> It is the only product I have found that makes it easier to brush my hair with less knots! It leaves my hair so silky and smooth! Amazing product!!</li>
            <li> I read the reviews of this product before I bought it and I found the smell and the texture of people&#x27;s hair seemed to come up a lot in positive remarks. So I took a chance and bought it and I am glad I did! My hair is course and dry. Plus it is wavy and thick. I live in southern California so I am in the sun most of my time. Escaping the sun is next to impossible. So I really needed a product that can help my hair keep its moisture. This does the job! Seriously my hair feels silky after I use this. A day or two after I use it, and the effect is still there. Maybe longer. I really like the smell too. I know sometimes a hair product can go overboard on scent. This is not one of them. I hate to say it, but it reminds me of the warm deliciousness of pancakes on a Sunday morning when you haven&#x27;t eaten in a day or two. It smells really nice.</li>
            <li> I have awful dry hair and this has been great for me! It helps to make my hair much softer and more manageable. It is definitely worth a try if you suffer from dry hair like I do. It has a nice smell to it also which is good since I hate conditioners that make my hair smell weird (I know that sounds strange). Great product!</li>
            <li> Great conditioner! We use it daily and leaves hair feeling incredibly soft and shiny. Love that the ingredient list is readable and not full of synthetics.</li>
            <li> My hair is very long and at the ends it is dead and coarse. After I used this conditioner, my hair looked and felt amazing. Even the parts that are dead were soft and looked really fresh. I would definitely recommend this conditioner.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is liquid gold. After my hair was destroyed by a botched professional bleach job, I searched high and low for a product to save the remnants of hair. I was highly skeptical that this conditioner would live up to its rave reviews. Much to my surprise, after using this conditioner twice, it transformed my hair from straw to silk. I am in love with this conditioner and plan to keep it in my hair routine.</li>
            <li> I have a 2 year old daughter that has hair that tangles easily. I&#x27;ve been on the search for something to help but something that doesn&#x27;t have chemicals in it. After researching and reading customer reviews, I decided on the Silk 18 conditioner. This is awesome stuff. Her hair brushes out so easily after bath time. Only a SMALL amount is needed so I think the bottle will last a long time, too. It also smells incredible. Even my husband is impressed! I definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I like holistic products because they don&#x27;t include loads of toxic chemicals that can cause skin irritation or an allergic reaction. This product does contain many moisturizing products, but nothing toxic or particularly worrisome. The formula is safe enough to use on my delicate scalp, and it leaves my hair feeling moisturized but not particularly weighed down or sticky. The scent is of vanilla and almonds, sweet but not overpowering, so you actually like how it leaves a soft and gentle aroma. The formula is thick enough as to not be runny, and it still spreads evenly and smoothly throughout my wet hair. You don&#x27;t need very much of the product, a nickel size is usually enough to coat my hair, so this product will hopefully last me months.</li>
            <li> This product smells wonderful and conditions fairly well.  I like that it includes sea buckthorn oil and I sometimes add a drop of additional sea buckthron oil to it.  I seem to have less &amp;#34;fallout&amp;#34; in the shower and my curly hair has been manageable.  Price point is a bit of a challenge for the size but worth it for the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> love the results I got from using this, but this bottle would last me a very short amount of time, used it while traveling around America for a few weeks</li>
            <li> I needed a product that would not irritate my sensitive scalp, but still leave my hair soft.  This definitely does the job. I have very thick hair that tends to frizz and be difficult to style. This product leaves my hair soft, easy to brush through and style. It makes a huge difference if you can leave it on for a few minutes. It has a very light pleasant fragrance.</li>
            <li> Did not work well with my hair but it is 53 year old hair and grey is starting to peak out.</li>
            <li> If you are sensitive to smells, avoid this conditioner.  I&#x27;m not entirely sure why a company would make a natural conditioner and then scent it so strongly. It was like I&#x27;d covered myself in a cheap body spray from the mall.  Instant headache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My curls looked great when they were done drying, but I won&#x27;t be able to use the conditioner again.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this conditioner more, but it really didn&#x27;t follow through with its promises. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it&#x27;s not bad, but it&#x27;s not exceptional and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the price.  I have long, thick curly hair that tends to be dry and I didn&#x27;t find that this conditioner helped with moisture or damage. After using this product I switched to a certified organic hydrating conditioner and I think that works 100% better than this, for half the price no less! This may work well for some hair types, but not mine.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT!  I used it combined with the oily itchy scalp shampoo.  I can wash &amp; go with no worries.  I have long curly/wavy medium texture, sometimes frizzy hair.  Every other holistic product I have used ends up leaving my hair greasy eventually.  Also I feel like I need to use a ton to cover my hair.  I used a probably pea size amount of Silk18, &amp;  it glides through all my hair very easily.  I can go a couple days without washing/conditioning.  I can even jump in the shower and rinse off without washing my hair in the morning (my wake up) &amp; let my hair air dry after...it still turns out sleek &amp; smooth.  I think I read in one of the reviews that someone didn&#x27;t like the smell?  It smells wonderful.  It is vanilla.  Maybe that person doesn&#x27;t like vanilla!  I love it!</li>
            <li> Great conditioner. I have very frizzy hair especially in the summer time and this does a great job taming it without feeling greasy or oily. Just ordered another bottle. Love it. Paired it with the oily, itchy and greasy hair with organic rosemary shampoo. Works great together.</li>
            <li> I have lightweight curls which are easily distorted by products containing dimethicone, so understandably I was happy to find a product that does not contain this ingredient. The conditioner distributes easily throughout hair without leaving it feeling weighed down or greasy. It also really nourishes--not just coats the hair. I do feel like my hair is healthier after using it for two months. I agree with other reviewers--a little does go a long way; however, I still feel like $13 should buy more than 2 months worth of conditioner (and I condition my hair every other day and also have long hair). I would love to see the price go down a bit--maybe to the $9 mark--or perhaps the product volume increase by 50%. That seems like a more reasonable value to me.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of the Silk 18 &amp; fell in love with it.  It smells so good &amp; leaves my hair so soft &amp; shiny.  I have very wavy/curly hair &amp; have a big problem with frizz as I let my hair dry naturally &amp; this product seems to help a lot with that.  I love it &amp; highly recommend this as a great product!!</li>
            <li> If you have a sensitivity to fragrance or just find the smell of many products aggressively perfumey then this one is certainly worth a try. Also, it&#x27;s not heavy or oily but conditions my hair perfectly. My hair stylist is in love with my hair now.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item because it contained all of the ingredients that typically leave my hair soft, shiny and less dry:  keratin, panthenol and silk amino acids among other desirable contents.  The great reviews were another reason I decided to try Silk 18.  My hair has become dry as I have gotten older and also use color.  I have tried this ONE time and am so very pleased at the instant softness and shine using only a nickle size drop for hair that is to the top of my shoulders in length.  The application did not appear to impact the color as some products will.  The softness lasted through a nights sleep.  It is, as one reviewer put it &#x27;almost too soft&#x27;.  I will probably use it every 2-3 shampoos for this reason.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is due to the strong smell of vanilla that lasts long after the shampoo.  I do not use fragrance(s) and prefer my hair not have such a strong sustained fragrance.  I know this will keep my husband from benefiting from this awesome conditioner.</li>
            <li> I really love this conditioner.  It smells delicious, but not overpowering, just a sweet vanilla scent.  It is also all natural ingredients which is very important to me.  My hair feels very soft after using and I notice less frizz.  My only complaint is that this is a small bottle for the price.  I&#x27;ve been trying to use it a little more sparingly, but it has still only lasted me about 3 weeks for every other day use for medium length hair.  I&#x27;m used to paying a little more for high quality products and ingredients, so I understand it, just not sure if this can be my everyday conditioner at this price point or I may have to alternate with another natural conditioner that is less expensive, but I do really love this!  I just re-ordered another bottle so I&#x27;m hooked for now and would like to try some of their other products too!</li>
            <li> This conditioner is fantastic.  It smells wonderful and doesn&#x27;t tangle my hair.</li>
            <li> used 3 times &amp; not happy at all. Dries my hair out</li>
            <li> I just try a conditioner because my hair is beginning to dry in winter. I didn&#x27;t have a conditioner before. So without any experience, I chose the the bestseller 1 in Amazon. The result is excellent! I can clearly see my hair better, much smoother, much softer. Maybe next time I&#x27;ll try the shampoo of this band.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is wonderful! It smells terrific and left my daughters hair very shiny, silky, and smooth!</li>
            <li> I have been using Silk 18 for about 2 years now and i absolutely love it. I stumbled upon it looking for a remedy for my aged, dry and brittle hair.  Since my hair was also thinning, moisturizing it was a must. Since i started using silk 18, my curls are smoother, bouncier and shinier. My hair literally feels silky soft after evey wash and smells great! Amazon shipped it super fast so i will definitely be purchasing it through here more often. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Sometimes I prefer to use hair products which usually target a more feminine &#x27;audience&#x27;. That&#x27;s because they are more powerful than the other stuff that can be found on the market. As I often have problems with my hair (damaged due to enviromental factors), I decided to try this natural conditioner which is known to repair damaged hair. After several weeks of using, I came to the conclusion that this shampoo delivers exactly as desribed by the seller because I am seeing some obvious improvements in which regards the look of my hair.</li>
            <li> This is a good product. The company seems really honest about their products, I cant wait to try some more after this is over with.</li>
            <li> Very nice, works well, all natural, love it.</li>
            <li> I always use high quality shampoo and conditioner because I have long curly hair, which tends to be dry and have had fairly good results, but this stuff is the bomb!!  I purposely didn&#x27;t use the leave-in argan oil conditioner I have always used in the past and even without it my hair is very soft and easier to work with - no frizzies and not wiry feeling.  And honestly you can&#x27;t beat the price - MUCH better than salon brands.  I&#x27;m a convert!!</li>
            <li> My hair was surprisingly soft  when other products didn&#x27;t work. I have very dry, curly hair, and the underneath layer is always the driest to the point of being crunchy and way too curly. After one use all my hair is the same soft shiny texture. It also smells like vanilla. I love it!</li>
            <li> Wanted to try Wen hair care but I didnt want to spend the money and then I stumbled over this product. I love it! It makes my frizzy damaged hair silk smooth without weighing it down. It smells very nice, which my boyfriend loves. And my usual frizzy hair is tamed after washing my hair with this. Love this product!</li>
            <li> I love everything about this conditioner.  As one with curly hair, I don&#x27;t wash my hair every day, so I am especially pleased that it leaves my hair smelling freshly-washed for days!</li>
            <li> This is a really great product.  As I have oily hair I need a light conditioner and this does it.  Does not strip my color  and there is no build up on your scalp.  I know some people say that it smells like vanilla and other have complain that it stinks.  I personally think it smells like the warm brown sugar fragrance from Bath and Body Works. I use it with Maple Holistics Argan Oil Shampoo.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t untangle my hair. Left it dry and unmanageable. My 3 dollar suave conditioner is much better.</li>
            <li> great conditioner great seller&lt;br /&gt;thank you so much&lt;br /&gt;many thanks</li>
            <li> This stuff is awful, I really thought it would soften my hair because of all the rave reviews but it was honestly worse than regular grocery store conditioner. I loved the &#x27;silk&#x27; name, thought it would make my hair silky soft and fell for the labels nicely placed alongside the picture. I really don&#x27;t know why people love this stuff but it may have to do with the free product you get if you write a good review :-( Wish I knew about that sooner. I&#x27;m definitely returning this, waste of money which stinks because I was so looking forward to it coming in the mail at first. It made my slightly dry ends stiff as cardboard and dry like straw. My hair never felt so dead! And I only put a little of this stuff on and only on my ends. Maybe it works different for different hair types. My hair is straight and fine but has never reacted negatively to conditioner before. I really think this stuff is just full of chemicals, it has to be to dry my hair out like that and there isn&#x27;t even an ingredient list on the bottle! I don&#x27;t even know if that&#x27;s legal?? I&#x27;m going to use a deep conditioner once a week from now on and use whats worked for me in the past instead of wasting my money on things like this. I would really advise anyone to look through reviews by star ratings, don&#x27;t just go through the first couple of pages and see all 5 star ratings and think its a great product, most of these reviews were probably done positively to get the free product. There&#x27;s definitely negative reviews out there from people like me who would rather have their money back than endorse something that doesn&#x27;t work. But hey, maybe it does work for some people, I just wish I didn&#x27;t fall for the product.</li>
            <li> I have long, fine blonde hair, and have never loved a hair conditioner so much!!! THE BEST!!!</li>
            <li> It seemed to have made my hair smoother and more manageable, however it wasn&#x27;t as soft as i imagined it to be. My hair needs the extra TLC, but overall good smell not overpowering love that its holistic and does make my hair more manageable and less frizzy,</li>
            <li> Great product.  Leaves my corse grey colored hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Love this product and will continue to use!</li>
            <li> So I actually never use conditioner because it always makes my hair oily but I decided to get this conditioner along with my shampoo and it actually is awesomeness!!! It makes my hair silky and smooth without making it oily so it&#x27;s now officially the only conditioner I&#x27;ll use!!! 5stars!!!</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough about this and the shampoo.  Wonderful products!</li>
            <li> Oh I just love this conditioner!!! Makes my hair so soft and silky. My hair is really thin and get frizzy fast but with this conditioner it never gets frizzy!!! Jus soft beautiful hair :)</li>
            <li> I use to have very dry hair a old friend of mine told me about this product and I used it for like two weeks on my hair and I must say this has become my favorite conditioner for my hair and don&#x27;t get me started on the shampoo these are two amazing products for your hair</li>
            <li> My husband got this for me for Christmas because I am very picky with my products (I want then as natural as possible). I love love love this conditioner. It smells amazing and makes my hair so soft and easy to brush wet!</li>
            <li> In the last year, I have been diligently looking for a sulfate free conditioner for my 62-year old, long, mostly-dark brown hair. If you check my reviews, I have tried several different products, recently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a time, I stopped using shampoo, merely washing my hair with conditioner and water, or a co-wash and water, or a cleansing conditioner and water. After a few months, I could not stand it any longer. My hair simply did not feel CLEAN! So...I went back to using the only great shampoo that seems to leave my hair on my head, instead of in the sink and the drain, and the only one that really leaves my hair shiny - Jason&#x27;s Biotin Shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After washing it, I have been doing a &amp;#34;conditioner-experiment&amp;#34;, and while most of the results were good, the results I got using the Silk 18 Natural Conditioner by Maple Holistics, were great! My hair is behaving like hair, not straw, and it is extremely shiny. I only shampooed my hair once, rinsed it thoroughly, applied the conditioner at let it stay in my hair for about 60 seconds, and rinsed it out. I used my blow dryer, and my curling iron, too - so the conditioner seems to stand up to heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, my hair looks and feels great. I hope the results &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34;, as I don&#x27;t think one has to buy lots of different products to maintain healthy hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I will update this, after I have used it for awhile.</li>
            <li> My hair is very long thin &amp; color treated too &amp; after trying many products (esp conditioners) I ran across this item by recommendation on a blog I frequently visit &amp; was super impressed. I get compliments on how shiny &amp; soft my hair is &amp; washing/combing is not such a chore after using it. Also it added vibrancy &amp; lessened the dull tones my color treatments left behind. I recommend this highly!!!</li>
            <li> this is the best conditioner i tried.. my hair become silky and shine.. :)</li>
            <li> I think this would be a great assets to the dandify shampoo they offer.l I really hope I get to try it.</li>
            <li> This is the best conditioner I have ever tried. I had to try it as all the reviews raved on It. From the first use my hair was soft and shiny. I have always had extremely dry hair and now that its going gray, its even worse.  Silk 18 tamed it. I love the aroma too. The conditioner smells like almonds. I have been recommending it to everyone I know. Buy this conditioner, you will love your hair.</li>
            <li> Really wanted to like this product after reading all the reviews. It left my hair dry and full of static. Company made good on money back warranty.</li>
            <li> This is the most awesome, fantastic, moisturizing conditioner I&#x27;ve used in ages. I have since purchased 3 more bottles of Silk after I first used this one. I do mostly co-wash for my hair and this works extremely well. I am member of several hair forums and had written several post letting everyone know what a wonderful conditioner this is. I do hope this is never discontinued. Don&#x27;t sleep on Silk, you will be missing out on a wonderful product!!</li>
            <li> my fine hair had turned really dry and frizzy with the product I was using, so i went on Amazon looking for a deep conditioner. I read reviews about this product and decided to give it a try, though honestly I was a bit skeptical that it would work as well as people claimed. I&#x27;ve used it twice now and can definitely say that it is fantastic! The smell as everyone claims is a dreamy vanilla and just letting it soak in for 2 minutes before rinsing it off made my hair super soft and the frizz is reduced by at least 80%. By day 2, the frizz from my hair is completely gone and the shine is back! So far I am loving this conditioner and hope it will continue to give me amazing results. I recommend this product 100%</li>
            <li> Price needs to come down for me to buy it again.</li>
            <li> I used this product along with purador shampoo and after using this my hairs feel very soft.</li>
            <li> My hair is soo much thicker after using this.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful, makes your hair look and feel healthy without weighing it down. 5 stars!</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner. I was looking for something that worked but didn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling flat. Washes clean and got compliments on my hair the first time I used it! Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Such a wonderful conditioner! I bought it with their hydrate shampoo (which is great and smells amazing, btw) and it makes a good pair. I have dry, thick, damaged hair, and always struggled with finding shampoo and conditioner that wouldn&#x27;t leave my hair even more dry. Silk 18 leaves my hair very soft, silky, and manageable, and i can go out without straightening my hair often. This means that I won&#x27;t have to further damage my hair. There isn&#x27;t really much of a scent to the conditioner, which is nice, and you only have to use about a quarter sized amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only gripe is that the product is a bit pricey, but I am loving it so far and I&#x27;m glad i made the purchase.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this conditioner. I also bought the sulfate free shampoo which I love. I have long thick hair which is hard to comb when wet. This conditioner makes that much easier to do.</li>
            <li> Absolutely in love with this conditioner! I love the scent and the way it leaves my hair feeling so smooth and silky!! I was a bit afraid that it may not work as well if I used just the recommended amount of conditioner for my hair (I have medium length), but I was able to brush through my hair much more easily than with any other product of conditioner I have used in the past (with more product to even get the same effect that Silk 18 is able to do too). I would highly recommend this conditioner to any person that is looking for a change in their hair treatment or just looking for a new conditioner!</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. It makes my hair look silky without weighing it down. That&#x27;s a trick since my hair is frizzy from bleach, dye, and gray. This conditioner also doesn&#x27;t make my scalp itchy the way everything else I&#x27;ve tried does (even other natural products). I look forward to seeing the results of extended use. By all means, give it a try!</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner. It leaves my hair shiny and soft.  I&#x27;ve been looking for this kind of product for a long time. It also calms down any frizziness that happens due to the weather.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is the best of i have used till date. I color my hair and that makes my hair so dull and damaged. This conditioner worked like a magic. I feel my hair is alive after using this product. It leaves hair shiny, smooth and manageable</li>
            <li> I got this together with the argan oil shampoo and I absolutely love it! I have dry, curly, thin, color-tread hair that normally feels like hay before applying condition and I used to have to put after that leave-in conditioner to make it feel soft. NOT ANYMORE!!! This conditioner is super soft, I can&#x27;t stop touching my hair!!!!</li>
            <li> I liked trying shampoos and conditioner, and when I came to this silk 18 I couldn&#x27;t stop using it it makes your hair soft and it smells really nice</li>
            <li> This is one of my new favorites. I have very curly ethnic hair that tends to get very dry. So the right “conditioner&amp;#34; is critical. It left my hair feeling clean (no residue), soft, manageable, and silky as the name states. I was skeptical that it wasn&#x27;t natural due to all the the ingredients sounding like they have chemicals. But I googled most of them and every single one were basically natural. Oh and the scent was very pleasant. Hint of vanilla. The kind you smell in a all natural shop. Very smoky vanilla type smell. Calming.</li>
            <li> I like this conditioner as it is affordable, leaves hair feeling great and does not have toxic chemicals.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is wonderful!  I have very dry, brittle, naturally curly 60-something hair.  My hair is also chemically treated (to cover the gray). With the very first application,  my hair was  softer and silkier than it has been in years.  The conditioner relaxed the  frizz of  my hair, creating soft defined curls.  So happy I found this product!  Try it......you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> I had been purchasing a competitors &amp;#34;cleansing conditioner&amp;#34; for over two years but was tired of paying the high prices for lack luster results. When I discovered SILK I immediately cancelled all future shipments of my old brand.  Love how truly &amp;#34;silky&amp;#34; this conditioner leaves my hair...without having to use much at all.  A quarter size is truly enough for my mid-length hair worked through the ends of my hair with a wide tooth comb.  Don&#x27;t be fooled by infomercials for other brands...you can have soft, silky hair without all the chemicals in this great little bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this conditioner for a couple of months now and really like it. I have fine hair and live in a very dry climate, so it is hard to keep my hair healthy. This conditioner works well and keeps my hair soft and moist.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about spending this much money on a hair product, but after getting my hair colored and reading about all the harmful effects of non-organic products, I decided it was time to give this a try.  I must admit I was pleasantly surprised.  The conditioner works well.  It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy and yet it&#x27;s moisturized.  It smells great and a small amount goes a long wait.  I shampoo and condition my hair first so that I can leave it in until the end of my shower.  I am looking forward to trying the shampoo next!  Definitely high quality product.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is truly amazing!  My hair feels soft and oil-free for days.  It also smells amazing.  I highly recommend this product for anyone.</li>
            <li> I purchased this conditioner and two bottles of their shampoo--the shampoo for oily hair I purchased for my teenage son.  This conditioner is an AWESOME product!  I am 47 years old with shoulder length natural &amp;#34;silver&amp;#34; hair.  I have been looking for sulfate/paraben free products so that my hair will be soft, &amp;#34;un-wiry&amp;#34; and smooth.  This product is fantastic.  My husband loves to run his fingers through my hair.  He says that it feels like it did when we were dating 20+ years ago!  I will definitely buy this product again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My son is also happy with the shampoo to help with his oily hair.  I used to have to use dry shampoo on his hair in the morning (he showers and shampoos at bedtime).  When he uses the degrees-er shampoo, I don&#x27;t have to use dry shampoo on his hair!  Plus a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with my purchases!  I just wish they were available in stores as well!!</li>
            <li> use it with Sage Shampoo. Excellent product.</li>
            <li> I used this conditioner today and I really liked it. it has a wonderful smell and my hair felt very soft. There was a noticeable difference in the weight of my hair, it felt very light. I only gave it 4 stars because I can&#x27;t comment on the product&#x27;s performance over a long period of time yet.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipper. I ordered on a Thursday and received my package 2 days later. Way before the projected delivery date. Aside from that, I really like this conditioner. It&#x27;s not too heavy and it really helps my waist length dry hair. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like is that there is not any directions on the bottle. I guessed at how long to keep it on my hair (5 minutes) and it seemed to do the job. The scent is a strong vanilla type smell. It&#x27;s very strong in the shower but fades once your hair dries. I&#x27;ll definitely order it again.</li>
            <li> On one hand, it&#x27;s nice to know that I&#x27;m using a natural product on my hair.  I like the fact that they don&#x27;t use sulfates.  On the other hand, it really doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel silky smooth.  While I&#x27;m not necessarily interested in using this conditioner again, I&#x27;m definitely interested in trying some of their other products.</li>
            <li> I have naturally dry course curly hair, plus it got damaged a couple months ago with a poor coloring choice. This conditioner is amazing!! As soon as you put it on your hair you know it&#x27;s working. I can tell such a difference in just a couple weeks. Get it-you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I cannot overstate how amazing it smells! I have very fine, thin hair and this conditioner doesn&#x27;t weigh it down at all- quite the opposite really. My hair is incredibly bouncy and soft.</li>
            <li> lovely conditioner that smells great and has changed my hair. i love it so much.</li>
            <li> Love it, happy again with maple holistic!</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive skin. Pleasant vanilla scent is light and not overly perfumed. Leaves hair very silky and tames the frizz!</li>
            <li> Very good if couple of drops used. Otherwise leaves a residue.</li>
            <li> I have just finished up my first bottle of this product. I take a shower every 2 days now so 1 bottle lasts a very long time! So a little background about my hair, my scalp decided to get flaky, greasy, sore, and itchy. I was previously going between Head &amp; Shoulders and Dove. I decided I might as well give this product a shot and it has relieved my symptoms enormously. I purchased this in 2014 of September and wanted to wait until today to see the full effects of the switch before I wrote my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What has changed? Well, I have absolutely minimal dandruff! I literally had to shower every day in order to keep my hair non-greasy and non-itchy. Now I have gained an extra day between showers because this conditioner has helped so much. I really have no words to explain how happy I am that I ran into Maple Holistics. Not only is their custom service amazing, but their products are a godsend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first couple tries I was using it, it did not help detangle my hair when I went to brush it. Silly me, I was only keeping it in my hair for like 20 seconds. As soon as I gave it 2-3 minutes in my hair like the directions suggested my hair was very easy to brush!</li>
            <li> I have very long, wavy hair with lots of grey covered by home coloring that tends to frizz easily. I have tried my share of very high end conditioners that make my hair heavy and look greasy which is not a good look for anyone. After just 2 days of using this conditioner, my hair looks silky and feels very smooth and does not weigh down with residue or leave flakes on my scalp. Just soft tangle-free hair that smells amazing.&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients are natural and it lends to the outdoorsy smell with vanilla undertones that smells great all day. That being said, it is not priced like many similar natural products that are equal in results, it is very reasonably priced as a little goes a long way. About 2 minutes on while in the shower and rinse out with cool water. I alternate using it as a leave-in conditioner but this may not work for everyone, so test it first on your hair type.&lt;br /&gt;A cold rinse is recommended as well as adding a little to your paddle brush to help with brushing out all the snarls without pulling or damaging the hair when wet. I allow my hair to dry naturally to avoid heat damage and to reduce and further frizziness. I have been using it for 3 week now and it has become my new favorite. My hair looks and feels great and I am getting compliments.</li>
            <li> I love this product it&#x27;s made my hair really soft and flexible. my hair is pretty dry because I always bleach my hair for coloring and highlights . Now I don&#x27;t have to worry for dying my hair because I have Silk 18 *_*!&lt;br /&gt;thanks.</li>
            <li> Giving 4 out of 5 because of my unique hair type. The scent is amazing and the quality is excellent, however I have very dry and very thick and very damaged color treated hair so my hair requires a deep conditioning &#x27;masque&#x27; type conditioner. With that said, this still is an excellent product and my hair feels great after use. I just have to use another kind of deep conditioning treatment for the unruly curls and damaged ends once a week.</li>
            <li> It smells great! Really moisturizes my hair that is thick, curly and wiry. Best of all, it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li> Amazing . Silky baby soft hair. The best. On second bottle !! Get it.</li>
            <li> I adore this company AND this conditioner! I had received a sample of this conditioner to review, but my bottle had come damaged. And in all, I only received enough to coat the ends of my hair. I emailed them, telling them what had happened, and they they promptly sent me a FULL SIZED product to try,  instead of the little sample bottle. It was excellent and fast customer service! I think my replacement bottle came within a day or two.The conditioner was FABULOUS! It made my hair bouncy and full of life. I usually have super sensitive skin and break out to almost everything I try and use! But I found that this actually didn&#x27;t make me itch as much as I thought it would. I got a slight break out, but that was it. Other than that it was wonderful. The smell was like fresh wonderful vanilla. This was definitely worth the wait!!</li>
            <li> Abosultely fantastic! I have extensions in (real hair, tape in- if anyone has extensions) and they are beginning to get dry at the ends.  This conditioner if fantastic.  It smells delicious and it makes my hair feel so soft and smooth.  It is all natural and safe on hair.</li>
            <li> A little heavy but I like that it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this several times, just to be sure to give it a fair chance. I can&#x27;t say I would recommend it. It left my hair tangled, and once dry it wasn&#x27;t really soft. My hair feels somewhat dirty even though I thoroughly rinsed my hair.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice conditioner that leaves my hair feeling soft but manageable.  I have fine hair and many conditioners are just too heavy, causing my hair to appear flat and lifeless.  I also like the fact that this product is all natural, without parabens.</li>
            <li> The product worked very, and left my hair very soft.  However, I didn&#x27;t care for the vanilla scent. It was too strong for me. I will use this product occasionally.</li>
            <li> Worst conditioner i have ever used. Its as thin as water and doesnt work at all. All it does is make my back all slimey. Waste of money in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I was searching for a natural shampoo and conditioner after trying multiple products, including leave in conditioners and oils.  I tried this product based on the write up and its good reviews.  It detangled my fine hair and left it silky smooth without weighing it down.  No more looking, I found my conditioner.</li>
            <li> This is my now my third  purchase of this conditioner. It really leaves my fine hair which tends to be dry and frizzy, silky smooth and manageable. Love this one!</li>
            <li> Wonderful scent, leaves hair as shiny and soft as my most expensive deep conditioning treatments ( e.g. Lush&#x27;s Fluff-ease) and doesn&#x27;t weigh down my long, straight fine hair at all. Couldn&#x27;t be better! Ordering a second bottle right away just to make sure I won&#x27;t ever run out of it! My daighter, who has long, wavy/frizzy hair loves it too. Best thing I&#x27;ve ever tried for my hair. The product is silky to the point of being slippery - wonderful, wondferful, wonderful. Don&#x27;t change a thing!</li>
            <li> Really like this stuff but im highly allergic to something in it. Hair itches, hives and cherry redness.......but it does make my 4c hair very very soft. Unfortunately I can not use it very often. I did not return because i decided to use for ends of my hair the times i do use it. Kind of hard not getting on my scalp so i usually take 2 benadryl......just know once benedryl wear off head goes back to itching etc.</li>
            <li> Does what it is suppose to do made my hair soft much less frizzy.  Must buy both the  shampoo Argan Oil Shampoo, Sulfate...&lt;br /&gt;Maple Holistics and the silky conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have been on the hunt for an all natural conditioner for my super curly, dry hair for a while now.  I honestly bought this because it was on sale but it&#x27;s safe to say that I love the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It leaves my hair extremely soft and smooth, it does a fantastic job of fighting the frizz I&#x27;ve been battling my whole life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely worth it for the price and I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> This product smells and looks great! My hair feels super clean afterwards and even looks clean! I love it :)</li>
            <li> Really amazing conditioner, but the overwhelming vanilla perfume makes me gag. Very strong perfume smell.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this conditioner!  First time user - wonderful fragrance.  I live in the desert in Southern California and this products works!  Softens and moisturizes my hair.  Thank you Maple Holistics for creating this product!</li>
            <li> Makes your hair super soft!!! The smell isn&#x27;t as great as I would like it to be though.</li>
            <li> OMG this is the first time everrrr.... my hair has been so silky I mean I break about 3 combs a year, not anymore!&lt;br /&gt;This left my hair so straight and easy to straighten; I have never straightened my hair with a flat iron in less than 10 mins.&lt;br /&gt;For the most part I am scared of Keratin treatments, it dries but hair out but this in combination with all the amino acids... miraculous.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy again and again and again :)</li>
            <li> I purchased the argan oil shampoo and silk 18 conditioner about a  month and a half ago and wanted to make sure to use it for a while before reviewing to make sure I had a good idea.  Before going into details on the product I wanted to give a little history.  Ive had some serious health issues recently and between sickness and medications my easy to manage hair became brittle, greasy, and seriously thin.  My scalp became red dry and scratchy and I developed terrible dandruff.  For the last 9 months ive been trying to find a solution and finally came across this stuff.  At first it didnt seem to be working well my hair seemed more brittle and became greasy faster.  I decided to keep trying a little while longer hoping my hair just needed to adjust, I didnt get bad overnight so it likely wouldnt get better overnight.  After about 3 weeks I started seeing an improvement.  Less red scratchy skin, less dandruff and stronger hair.  Even my hairdresser commented when I went in last that my hair was stronger and my scalp less irritated.  After a month and a half I continue seeing improvement and feel much better.  I definitely recommend this stuff and suggest giving it time if you don&#x27;t see results right away.</li>
            <li> This is a good conditioner. My hair always feels nice and soft after my showers. I like that it is a more of natural shampoo that doesn&#x27;t have a lot of added or bad ingredients in it. Also I&#x27;m not a fan of fragrance, but this is shampoo has a very subtle vanilla smell which is nice.</li>
            <li> This and Argon shampoo is like someone sending you to a Spa, literally. Of course, I read all of the great comments  that everyone was saying and then I ordered. I used them the day that they came and &amp;#34;Oh my goodness &amp;#34;. The shampoo was a GREAT experience by itself but I&#x27;m a person who is moved by her nose...lol SCENTS  ,there is none . But, then I moved on to Silk18 that so many reviewers were speaking of. YESSSSS! Just the SMELLS will win you over but the experience does not end there. My HAIR, I&#x27;ve Dread Locks, was SOOO SILKY....in 1 wash! I purchased the 8 oz bottles used minimum with Dreads that are passed my waist. This stuff is awesome and make a VERY GOOD pair!</li>
            <li> All my life I&#x27;ve been a typical male when it comes to washing one&#x27;s hair--I used to simply pick any shampoo that &amp;#34;looked good,&amp;#34; was priced cheap and used it until finished with the bottle. Rarely a thought about conditioning my hair, etc. In recent years I&#x27;ve battled some tough dandruff and about two months ago I discovered Sage Shampoo for Heavy Dandruff. It worked!! I was so pleased with the Sage Shampoo that I was thrilled to learn about the companion Silk 18 conditioner and was willing for the first time in my adult life to buy a conditioner. Well it&#x27;s been about 3 weeks now that I&#x27;ve been using Silk 18 and I must say that I look forward now to spending those extra minutes just to condition my hair in the shower. First, the slight vanilla scent is really nice and soothing. Second, my thick hair feels really soft and manageable when dry. Third, I really like that it&#x27;s sulfate free. I definitely plan to keep on using this product and recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a honest conditioner to my frizzy brittle hair and I found this one recently which works magic on my hair. It&#x27;s just make my hair smooth as I expected. I would buy again &amp; often.</li>
            <li> Very good conditioner for one you don&#x27;t have to leave in for 10 minutes. With the water shortage out here, no one wants to be waiting 10 minutes between shampoo and final rinse. This one works in just 2 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is light and very pleasant. I&#x27;m also glad to know the ingredients are all natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give it 5 stars except that my hair needs a deeper conditioning. It doesn&#x27;t come out as soft as with my previous conditioner. But on the whole, I&#x27;ll probably switch to this one and just spritz with a little water and oil to make up the difference. The pluses definitely outweigh the minuses. And if your hair doesn&#x27;t need as deep a conditioning, then there will be no minuses. Just soft, smooth hair with no flyaways and no chemicals or strong fragrance.</li>
            <li> before writing any review , i wanted to use this product for sufficient amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;Now I am using product last 2 months and all i can say it is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;My hair quality is very dry and after using this product i can see lots of improvement in my hair quality and i can feel softness in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Consistency of this product is also good , so you need to use small amount and you are done. For me one bottle lasted around two months and i have medium length hair.&lt;br /&gt;I am loving this product and will continue to use.</li>
            <li> A few facts up front: 1) I have naturally thick, oily, semi-curly hair, 2) I&#x27;ve rarely let my hair grow out for more than several months, 3) I&#x27;ve never bought an &amp;#34;expensive&amp;#34; conditioner before, and 4) I use natural soap on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The review: I decided to try this product after about 7 months of letting my hair grow out. The combination of my hair type and the natural soap was making my hair unmanageable, and I was not satisfied with how it felt or looked. At first, I bought a cheaper conditioner, and though that helped, I wasn&#x27;t thrilled about some of the ingredients (and lack of others). Through some searching, I came across Silk18 by Maple Holistics and was happy to see what it included (100% natural) and what it left out (no artificial fragrances, colors, and sulfates). Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with SIlk18. I can immediately feel a difference when using it, and my hair has become much less oily and curls better. On the downside, this product is a bit pricey; however, you get what you pay for with a product like this.</li>
            <li> I tried Silk 18 conditioner from Maple Holistics and I love it! It left my hair super soft and the shine is incredible! The aromatherapy is great too, nice sweet vanilla!! I&#x27;m hooked!! I highly recommend this product!! 😊</li>
            <li> This conditioner has a nice vanilla bean scent that is not overly potent. I didn&#x27;t need to use nearly as much conditioner to untangle my hair with this product. It has a nice silky smooth texture and left my feeling very soft.  I have thick wavy hair that can get pretty dry, and this product has helped my hair retain more moisture, as well as prevent frizz. If you have thick hair with dry ends, I would suggest following up with some hair serum or oil. Overall, I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product. Because this product doesn&#x27;t weigh down your hair and is able to soften thick unruly hair; I would recommend it for all hair types.</li>
            <li> Worked great on my hair! Loved the shine it leaves</li>
            <li> This is good stuff and smells great. It is nice and light which isn&#x27;t enough for my very dry hair sometimes. Overall, I&#x27;d recommend this product though and I&#x27;ve bought it multiple times.</li>
            <li> The conditioner conditions, so high marks there. My problem is with the scent. I purchased this as a complement to their Sage shampoo, but did not know that the vanilla scent would be so overpowering. As a male, the last thing I wanted was for my hair to smell like a baked good or, worse, a Yankee Candle all day. Looking forward to Maple Holistics future offerings - hopefully a better complement to their Sage shampoo is forthcoming.</li>
            <li> This product smell wonderful a nice light vanilla smell. I bleach my hair and this product made it feel nice a soft. I will buy this product again!</li>
            <li> Loved the warm vanilla scent when using! Conditioner left my hair very manageable. Will continue to use.</li>
            <li> I purchased this conditioner in the hopes that i would finally find a product that would tame my frizzy, bleached and dyed hair. A few months ago I decided to go purple,then blue, which of course meant i needed to bleach my hair first because naturally I&#x27;m a brunette. This completely damaged my hair to the extent that I could&#x27;t use any heat utensils like my blow dryer, straightener, etc because my hair would just literally burn off! I was so upset and regretting what I had done to my hair because now it looked to be permanently broken. I purchased a few organic products from stores like whole foods and whatnot, but they only left my hair dry and tangled. I was literally at the point of just wanting to cut all my hair off. I was so frustrated. But I checked on Amazon and came across this company. I read some of the reviews and decided I had nothing to lose. So I purchased the Silk 18 Conditioner alongside the moisturizing shampoo. I was thrilled to see that I could put a comb through my hair after using these products and not catch a single tangle. It was like my hair was completely tamed. It was softer, smelled amazing, and looked healthy! The products are a little on the costly side for such a small amount, but hey, it&#x27;s worth every penny if I&#x27;m able to wear my hair naturally and get compliments! Definitely going to repurchase, although I think I&#x27;ll try a different shampoo.</li>
            <li> I bought this product about three months ago all I can say is that I didn&#x27;t like it. I bought it because I read all the wonderful reviews, but I didn&#x27;t get the same results. It&#x27;s very expensive and it has the same level of performance as any other product from a grocery or drug store.</li>
            <li> My favorite conditioner. Smells so good and leaves my hair soft but not limp.</li>
            <li> As a swimmer, I was looking for a product that would help protect my hair from chlorine damage and the constant washing and drying that goes along with swimming. This product helps in keeping my hair more normal and less dried out then before when I was not using &amp;#34;Silk 18&amp;#34;. I use this along with this &amp;#34;It&#x27;s A 10 Miracle Leave In Product, 4-Ounces&amp;#34; which I put on my hair before going to the pool. If you want to protect your hair then I recommend both. I hope that this information is useful to you and if it is then please click the helpful button.</li>
            <li> love the smell and feel of this in my hair, great product</li>
            <li> I decided to try to do something about my thinning, thin hair - and the Argan Oil Shampoo along with the Silk 18 Natural Conditioner by Maple Holistics sounded hopeful, so I purchased both just two weeks ago. Already, my hair has more body, shine and texture to it - and is looking like real hair - not frizzy-foam.  I even tried some on my 4-year-old granddaughter&#x27;s thin, fly-away baby hair, and even she noticed!  She said her hair made her feel like Rapunzel!  From the mouths of babes...you&#x27;ll really like it.</li>
            <li> Overall this product is named appropriately. Makes my hair super silky! I have fine straighter hair and it makes it shine, and feel healthier. Only drawback is has no volume, so I use a volumizing spary on my roots to give texture.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this! I&#x27;m a cosmetologist and the list of products I have tried is endless, but this is by far my favorite! My hair has gotten completely dried out from always changing the color (yes I know it&#x27;s bad but I can&#x27;t help it!) but, after using this conditioner just once my hair feels a million times better so I am beyond excited to keep using it and I plan on recommending this product and brand to all of my friends. I not only generally love this product but also I adore the fact that it&#x27;s made from natural ingredients and not tested on animals! All in all, five stars from me and would definitely recommend trying this!</li>
            <li> I have tried almost every hair product out there and have always been on the search for the perfect conditioner.....this is it!  I use it as both a regular conditioner and a leave on. It detangles, softens and it makes my super dull hair shine. I have thick, naturally curly hair with a keratin treatment that has been destroyed by a bleach job gone terribly wrong. I&#x27;ve already had to cut too much off and was looking for something to salvage the rest until it can grow out. I I tried this conditioner based on the positive reviews it had gotten on Amazon.  I was initially worried about the vanilla scent because I was afraid I might smell like a birthday cake, but this is a nice perfumy vanilla - not a sickly sweet type. I really like the scent and the product and highly recommend it. I have not yet tried their shampoos but definitely thinking about it!</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner! Makes my hair very soft, and the smell is like vanilla almonds. :) Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I bought this along with the sage shampoo...perfect combination for sensitive scalp and no build up!</li>
            <li> I am an Asian woman in her twenties with shoulder-length black hair.  I never use heat products on my hair.  My chief complaint with my hair is that it tangles where it makes contact with my pillow.  It is very frustrating since most of my hair is straight, but the tangled regions look very fractured and damaged, even after combing it out.  My next complaint is that my scalp gets itchy with dandruff within a few hours after washing my hair.  This makes me feel like I need to wash my hair everyday, but I don&#x27;t want to because I feel like I lose a lot of hair each time I wash.  This brings me to my final complaint: my hair is losing its volume.    I had been a loyal customer of Organix products throughout college, but now I feel a bit heartbroken because I suspect their shampoo and conditioner were the culprits behind my flat, lifeless and greasy thinning hair.  Perhaps they changed the ingredients over time.  I was not even halfway through my old shampoo and conditioner bottles, but my hair was screaming at me to try something better.    Three days ago, I bought the Silk 18 conditioner.  It arrived yesterday.  After rinsing out my old shampoo, I applied a quarter size of this conditioner throughout the body of my hair and then a little more at the ends.  It had a concentrated but pleasant vanilla scent to it.  I left it on for 5 minutes, then rinsed it out with cold water.  I dried my hair by squeezing moisture out with a towel.  Then, I let it airdry.    This morning, I woke up with straight, healthy-feeling and lightly scented hair!  I&#x27;m pretty happy with this product, since my hair felt a little bit stronger after one use.  It was very easy to comb through it.  Maple Holistics seems like a company I can trust.  I am excited to try their tea tree shampoo next and see if it can fix my scalp problem!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful conditioner, leaves my hair soft, manageable and weightless. I have oily hair so need only a little bit.  Initially bought the Degreaser Shampoo but was not happy with it.  I mentioned this to the customer service rep who contacted me.  He told me he would send me another shampoo which would work better for me.  He sent me the Sage Shampoo FREE OF COST - This is great customer service for a product that is so affordable in the first place.  Also the rep was very knowledgeable - the new shampoo he sent me was perfect for my hair type.  My hair and scalp are no longer greasy, completely flake free.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product.  it is worth trying it for a few weeks to see if it works for your hair.</li>
            <li> First, there is not gluten (wheat germ or oats), a must for me. I really like the product. I had never heard of the brand before but was looking for a new conditioner and decided to give it a try. I have very fine shoulder-length hair and it worked like a charm, silky, no tangles, and smells really nice!</li>
            <li> Wonderful stuff.  Smells great and vanilla-ey without being overpowering.  I have noticed a definite improvement in my dry/frizzy hair.  It is much softer and I just let it air dry and work some coconut serum through it to get rid of the last bit of frizzies and it is good to go.  Using this silk 18 conditioner in conjunction with this hair mask every other washing http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00I32AN4K/ref&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o05_s00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1 has made a huge difference in the texture and health of my hair.  It feels much stronger, looks fuller, and actually stays feeling conditioned after washing for several days (I only wash my hair about once every 3-4 days).  Highly recommend this conditioner and I love the natural/high quality ingredients!</li>
            <li> this conditioner leaves my hair soft and shiny and the smell is so nice!</li>
            <li> I am in love! This is the best conditioner I have EVER used. No more paying $30 a bottle for conditioner that doesn&#x27;t make a difference. This leaves my hair soft and less brittle. Wonderful product. Will continue to purchase!  Update: 11/15/2016. Still buying this product. Still makes my hair soft and beautiful. Anytime I use a different conditioner I fall in love with this one all over again. Just buy it!!!!</li>
            <li> Wonderful, best I&#x27;ve ever used! Leaves hair soft and shiny following your fantastic shampoo.</li>
            <li> I love the product. It has a really nice smells. It does the job. I am obsessed about using natural/organic products because I am concerned about the environment as well as the health of my hair. This product is cruelty free, and has great quality. Leaves my hair smooth and I am very sure my hair loves all the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> A true conditioner. Works great. I wish I could buy it in a huge bottle that&#x27;s how much I loved it.</li>
            <li> smells great and makes my hair feel silky smooth. really wonderful conditioner! and my hair is bleached to the max. it&#x27;s great to have something that can repair such damage i&#x27;ve done.</li>
            <li> This conditioner smells amazing, Im pretty sure I&#x27;ve found my shampoo and conditioner I can actually stick with.</li>
            <li> This is truly a wonderful conditioner. Often I&#x27;ve tried natural shampoos being careful to steer clear of all the chemicals in most shampoos/conditioners, and been less than satisfied with the results. The Maple Holistics line is true to it&#x27;s word leaving my hair, clean, soft, manageable, smelling great and easy to style. I never find it leaves my hair dry or brittle, which I can say has been the result with many other natural brands.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing! Just a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Made my hair manageable..</li>
            <li> Repeat customer.  Works great on my long hair. I put a quarter sized amount in my ends after I wash and towel dry. I alternate between this and my Niel george</li>
            <li> Delivered on time but product made my hair very tangly. Not as described and very disappointed. Had to discard! Waste of money!</li>
            <li> I also use a sulfate free shampoo by Maple Holistics and I&#x27;m very happy with their products.  A good choice for people wanting to keep chemicals out if their bodies and homes.</li>
            <li> This stuff is GREAT! I had been looking for a new conditioner/shampoo since I DESTROYED my hair using the &#x27;on sale&#x27; shampoos/conditioners... In 1 wash I could already see a difference... in about 3-4 washes my hair is almost back to it&#x27;s full luster! My hair feels soft again and gets less tangles. This is a cheaper option then WEN and I honestly like it better! Do they make bigger sizes??? LOL</li>
            <li> After trying numerous conditioners, I have finally found this product that really works. It leaves my hair soft and silky, and it feels so natural. It also works as a great detangler. My hair is long, fine, and color-treated, and this conditioner is perfect for it. I am sure it would be great for any hair type.</li>
            <li> Great conditioner!! It makes my hair so silky and really helps with frizz! It smells wonderful too like vanilla! I&#x27;m so glad I found this!</li>
            <li> Loved this product!&lt;br /&gt;I purchased with the argan shampoo. The shampoo is fine, nothing to write home about, but the conditioner is fabulous.&lt;br /&gt;When my hair feels straw-like after shampooing, this makes it honestly silky smooth!&lt;br /&gt;Love the vanilla scent!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for more than a month and my hair - which is wavy and tends to be dry and frizzy - is definitely softer. I combine this with another conditioner that is a little heavier to keep my hair more manageable. I recommend this conditioner and plan to try their shampoo.</li>
            <li> Just purchased my 2nd bottle!This has to be the best conditioner I have used in my life. I have dry and naturally curly hair and have always bought store shampoo and conditioner. My hair is so dried out and thinning on top. I used this conditioner for the first time today and man it really put the moisture in my hair. This is the first time in my life that I didn&#x27;t have to add a oil or cream for frizz after I shampooed. This stuff is awesome and I&#x27;m a forever user. I really want to try their shampoo with tea tree and see if that helps my thinning and hair breaking off. I highly recommend this conditioner for dry hair or any hair for that matter. You won&#x27;t be disappointed ! Love it :) my hair feels alive and had body for the first time.</li>
            <li> I have thin dry short wavy hair which is also partly gray.  Silk 18 seems better than most store brands for helping manageability of my hair, even in the dry winter season.  The bottle lasted me about two winter months based upon two times a week usage.  I agree with some reviewers that the fragrance is a bit strong while standing in the shower, but I don&#x27;t notice it anymore after rinsing and drying.  It rinses cleanly and I don&#x27;t feel any residue.  Keep your eyes closed when rinsing, it stings!</li>
            <li> I ordered this product based on the reviews and I can honestly tell you it&#x27;s the best! My hair was silky smooth. I love the scent as well very pleasant not over powering!  Will I order it again!!!! DEFINITELY YES!!</li>
            <li> I have tried countless products for my hair and this is the first time, I think I would make a repeat purchase.  My hair feels softer with significantly less breakage after blow-drying and straightening.  My only con would be products (shampoo &amp; conditioner) do not have any real smell as compared to other brands.  However with the company be holistic, this is to be expected.  I would prefer this over chemical additives to improve product scent.  I definitely will purchase again!</li>
            <li> I am always looking for new shampoos and conditioners to try.  I saw this on sale and decided to give it a try.  It really works well on my color treated and curly hair.  My hair tends to frizz quite a bit, and this conditioner makes my hair feel really smooth without weighing it down which is a hard balance to find.  This conditioner allows body while taking away frizz.  At first I thought the vanilla scent smelled fake, but the more I use it, the more I really enjoy the smell.  The price was an ok cost for the size of the bottle.  I will look elsewhere however if the price does not remain on sale.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner.  It smells great and makes my hair very silky and manageable!</li>
            <li> I am addicted to Camamu shampoo bars and I have been trying to find a conditioning product that would work for me as well as that brand does. It is very hard for me to find natural hair products that would work on my thick and curly hair... stating that- this conditioner is amazing! My hair was not a tangled mess after I washed it, its softer than it usually is, and this conditioner has a great scent. I certainly recommend that you buy this and see for yourself.</li>
            <li> After an unsuccessful attempt at the No Poo method, I decided to transition to all natural haircare products. Most all natural shampoos and conditioners are pretty expensive, so when I saw this one on &amp;#34;sale&amp;#34; for $10.77, I figured I&#x27;d give it a try. Although, the cluster of all positive reviews all on the same days as one another was suspicious, and honestly made me think twice about this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for about two weeks now, and am glad I purchased it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- It has a pleasant but very strong warm vanilla smell at first, but it does air out a bit after the shower.&lt;br /&gt;- A little bit goes a long way&lt;br /&gt;- Leaves hair feeling silky and soft, even the next day&lt;br /&gt;- Seems to reduce frizz? Although, we&#x27;re at the end of a NC summer so it could just be weather-related, but I think the conditioner played a small part.&lt;br /&gt;- Tried on my colored, wavy, shoulder length hair, my teen&#x27;s very long and super thick straight hair, and my toddler&#x27;s long baby fine curly hair, all with success. Everyone&#x27;s hair was soft, smelled nice, and easily combed. Just be sure to rinse hair well to get all of the conditioner out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;None, really. Although, I&#x27;m concerned with the pricing of this item - List price: $24.99 Price: $19.99 Sale Price: $10.77. I would not pay more than $10.77 for this size bottle of this product and wouldn&#x27;t even have looked at it if it was more expensive. I hope it doesn&#x27;t go up in price, or else I&#x27;ll have to look elsewhere for conditioner.</li>
            <li> i wanted something holistic, i&#x27;m not sure why. This smelt awful and i used a very small amount. I think you should pass wish i did.</li>
            <li> I decided to order this product after reading reviews and I liked that they 100% back their products.  I also like that it is a sulfate free product.  The product came with a neat little information card that explained some of the key ingredients and how your hair will benefit.  It also provided washing/styling instructions.  I noticed a difference right away after using this product.  My co-worker even asked me if I had a new product!  My hair feels softer, silkier, and very healthy with a natural shine.  The scent is a very light vanilla (not too overpowering).  Shortly, after receiving the product I was contacted via email by the company.  The rep wanted to confirm I&#x27;d received the product and how I liked it.  I don&#x27;t usually respond to these communications but I was so pleased I decided to let them know (I also don&#x27;t ever write reviews)!  We emailed back and forth several times as I had questions about which shampoo would most benefit my hair/scalp as I have itchy, flaky issues.  The rep offered me samples of the two he recommended and shipped them out same day!  I just received those samples today and they are a very generous (1.5 fl oz)!  I am thrilled because I know I will need to use the products several times in order to see true results.  I would highly recommend this product to others!  :)</li>
            <li> Love it. It make my hair feels and looks silky.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a good conditioner to go along with my new organic shampoo that I purchased a few weeks ago.  Before changing over to the better quality shampoo I had been using the bargain basement shampoo from target for a long long time. I just purchased the cheapest shampoo I could see on the shelf. Yeah you guessed it, I am a guy and getting up there at that. I had long hair when I was a teenager in the early seventies until I went in the Air Force,then good-by long hair, in fact good-by hair all together!!.  I made a career of it and got used to short hair and kept it short for many years. A few months ago I decided I am going to let it grow out again and have a pony tail like most of the old retirees I see around.  Well, it didnt take long to find out my hair was not what it used to be. As soon as it got a little longer it was all frizzy and dried out, looked terrible, I thought about going to get a hair cut and forget about the pony tail.  My daughter came over and said your hair is all dried out from using that degreaser of a shampoo you use. So I went and bought a organic shampoo and started using that. It made a little bit of difference. After a couple of weeks my hair was still dried out.  Ok, I am going to let you in on a little secret, I did some research on line about what causes your hair and skin to dry out like it does. And it always comes back to the water you are using to shower or bath in. The water quality in this country is terrible. Depending where you live they could be using Chlorine,Chloramines or Monochloramines to purify the water. Those chemicals you are absorbing while taking a shower dry out your hair and skin big time. And your breathing in the mist into your lungs while taking a shower. (that&#x27;s bad)  I went online and found a shower filter that removed the Chlorine and Chloramines and the heavy metals from my water and installed them onto my shower. Within three days I could feel the difference in my hair and skin. I can not say it enough, These shampoos and conditioners try to put back the natural oils that these chemicals in the water are taking out. Using these good quality shampoos and conditioners along with the shower filter makes a huge difference.  I also installed a vitamin c shower head filter with a flexible hose a week after installing the first shower filter after reading about them and what the vitamin c does for your hair and skin. That was like icing on the cake. Even at my age my hair is soft and shinny. I cant believe it.  My main filter is the Pelican I purchased on Amazon and the Vitamin c shower head filter I purchased on anther online store, but they do sell them on Amazon.    If you decide to purchase a shower filter contact your local water company and talk to the water quality section to find out what they use to purify the water. Then check on the company website of the shower filter you are thinking of buying to see what the shower filter will reduce or eliminate, you might have to call the filter company as they don&#x27;t always say what they \\&quot;wont\\&quot; filter out. Only a very few will filter out Monochloramines, some water companies use that instead Chlorine. Some use Chloramine and some use both Chlorine and Chloramine like my water company. A lot of the shower filter advertisements descriptions say they will reduce Chlorine but do not mention the other two, If they removed them they would put that in their advertisement. Check before purchasing, you might think that the filter you bought is protecting you when in reality it is not filtering anything.﻿</li>
            <li> My expectations of this product has been reached 100% !!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the smell and its great for my natural hair. I wanted to try this because I had a run in with Maple Holistics Argan Sulfate Free Shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;A lot of people complained about its faint smell and its ineffective usage unlike the Silk 18 conditioner. I tried the argan sulfate free shampoo because it was the number one shampoo recommended on amazon. I have to say I had amazing results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now after reading the silk 18 reviews I was happy to try it. I love the smell, I was afraid that it would be too much but it was just right. My hair looks amazing and it feels great. I have a short afro due to me embracing my african american roots, I went full on natural and this product is number oe for me !!!</li>
            <li> This conditioner is a fantastic product, makes your hair soft without weighing it down and it leaves a nice scent. I&#x27;m in love with this product.</li>
            <li> I love the Silk 18 by Maple Holistics! When you use it for the first time you can feel a huge difference. It has a nice vanilla smell that stays with you all day and keep your hair looking silky and great.</li>
            <li> Best product I ever bought for my hair.... hair feels incredibly soft.</li>
            <li> Great product, makes my hair feel silky and clean.  I will be buying again for sure.</li>
            <li> I have curly-wavy hair and have been using DEva curl products for quite some time.  I recently tried Silk 18 and have found the results to be the same as Deva curl conditioner. Love the smell! will re-order.</li>
            <li> The product is excellent!!! Never felt my hair so soft, never saw them so shiny. Great smell!</li>
            <li> It really surprised me how concentrated the conditioner was with the natural ingredients it has. I have tried the conditioner from Christina Moss Naturals, but I used up the bottle in about five uses. It runs through my hair very easily. I am still unsure that it does absolute miracles for my hair, but it is definitely a plus in my book for the conditioner to contain ingredients that are truly good for my body. My only complaint is that I prefer more floral or fruity scents when it comes to hair products, but don&#x27;t you worry, it is not a deal breaker here!</li>
            <li> Love it! Leaves my hair smooth and smells sooo good!</li>
            <li> This conditioner really helped my hair, it is much better looking and I have to thank this product for it! My hair isn&#x27;t as frizzy or dry anymore due to the great ingredients that are in the product. I have used many other products such as Clear and Pantene but they don&#x27;t nearly compare to this. I highly recommend this to all!</li>
            <li> I love it!  My hair loves it!  I&#x27;ll never go without this conditioner I hope.  My hair is coarse , dry and long plus I live at elevation in the Rocky Mountains.  This conditioner makes my hair feel nourished and moisturized like nothing else I&#x27;ve tried.  My hair is so soft I keep touching it and other people have commented on how good it looks.  I rave about it to anyone who will listen.  Found this on a fluke and am so happy I did.  The best part?  All natural and made in the USA.  Well worth the money.  Buy it!</li>
            <li> This conditioner does wonders for my hair! I have used every type of organic conditioner and really feel that this is the best conditioner for my hair. It makes my hair feel even better than a deep conditioning. I love using this, and I think I will slowly transition into only using Maple Holistics brand for my hair. Very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> perfect for the Henna natural color system. Leaves your hair sleek and soft but not unmanageable I will use this no matter what hair color I use.&lt;br /&gt;I have natural curly hair that I have struggled with my whole life so this is just a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> This conditioner works great - and has a nice smell as well. It made my hair very soft, silky, and manageable. Now if I could only get a bit more for my money...8oz doesn&#x27;t last long with long hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the record, I have thin, fine hair, that needs a good washing about three times a week... so probably moderately oily. People with a similar hair type I imagine would have similar results :).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: After using the conditioner for a while I did find it to be somewhat drying when I used it with their accompanying shampoo. I think part of the problem is that there is keratin in this conditioner which is great (makes hair shinier, stronger) but for some people if you use this conditioner more than once a week it will be drying for you. It really depends on your hair type. For some people this would be better as a supplementary conditioner, for others (like me) three times a week works well.</li>
            <li> Has a lot more chemical ingredients than I expected, but I tried it out. It left my hair feeling stiff and like a waxy residue was left on it. The smell was great, but hardly natural. Overall, I do not think I will purchase this product again. It is too expensive for such a small bottle and the ingredients and results are not something I would pay money for.</li>
            <li> This conditioner felt silky in my hair, and did not leave a residue, or build up over time.  Instead it left my hair feeling smooth and healthy.  I will continue to use it!</li>
            <li> This product makes my hair feel smooth compared to other conditioners. I like to use sulphate-free shampoos and conditioners. My previous ones used to leave my hair dry. But I like this one! The only reason I give this 4 stars is it is a bit expensive.</li>
            <li> After reading positive reviews of the product I wanted to give it a try myself. I was searching for a conditioner which could deep condition but at the same time does not weigh my hair down. I wanted to use it a few times before leaving a review here. I have to say I am very pleased with this product. It feels great, smells sweet and works! My hair is shiny, frizz free and soft now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me the top 3 selling points of this conditioner are that it&#x27;s sulfate free, not tested on animals and i can use it with my own shampoo! And of course that it does what it promises. Silk 18 is the star in my bathroom :) Thank you for this amazing product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month now. It has a very strong scent of vanilla, which I am not a fan of, but seems to be getting milder, the further down the bottle I go. The performance of this product is incredible for being natural. It makes my hair soft, manageable, and shiny. I have tried many chemical free hair products a lot more expensive, and nothing even compares!!  The results, are what I get when I go to the salon!</li>
            <li> Smells awesome!  And a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have fine, oily hair; I bought the Maple Holistics Degrease shampoo and this conditioner.  I love the shampoo and will be purchasing it again, but this product seemed to heavy for my hair.  However, the company has excellent customer service.  I contacted them, and they recommended the Argan Conditioner.  I passed this product on to a friend with coarser hair, and she loves it.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner. It has a vanilla scent to it. It leaves my hair very smooth and soft. I would recommend this product to anyone. You really can&#x27;t go wrong with this conditioner.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed this conditioner! It leaves my hair so soft and manageable, unlike all the other products I have found.  This is by far the best and most natural creme rinse for any hair type. Thanks Maple Holistic for such a wonderful product!</li>
            <li> Best conditioner I have ever used. I give this as a gift to friends now. Great to use with or without the argan oil shampoo.</li>
            <li> I used this along with their Argan Oil shampoo.  The shampoo takes a little getting used to for someone with thick, long hair.  It doesn&#x27;t get sudsy like cheaper shampoo&#x27;s so it takes a little more time to wash thick hair thoroughly without tangling it.  The conditioner worked well and was easy to apply.  After 1 wash I could see a difference that even other people noticed.  My hair was absolutely more silky/shiny and had less frizz.  I will definitely be purchasing more.</li>
            <li> I love that this product has so many natural oils and ingredients.  I have fine hair that is nice and full after drying my hair.  It leaves an incredible shine and my hair is lightened however it is super easy to comb through after washing.  I no longer need another product to help comb through tangles. I wish it came in a larger bottle as I will be purchasing more in the future.  Wonderful vanilla fragrance as well that doesn&#x27;t linger after drying your hair.</li>
            <li> I work outside in Florida so my hair is super dry from the sun.  I love this conditioner!  My hair is super soft and love the vanilla smell.</li>
            <li> Love, love this conditioner! This with the MH Argan shampoo leaves my hair luxuriously soft and wavy and shiny. It&#x27;s hard to find a conditioner that works to soften without weighing down my fine hair, and this is it! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I bought this as an attempt to bring some life back to my hair, which used to be one of my best features but, after many months with a thyroid disorder, has grown in grainy, kinky, and coarse. After two uses, I can say that my hair feels significantly softer. Naturally the coarseness and weird texture hasn&#x27;t gone away, but the conditioner does something to the overall feel and look of my hair. It&#x27;s also less frizzy and, therefore, shinier. I plan to keep purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> Love it! Smells SO nice- like vanilla. I use the maple holistics degrease shampoo which leave my hair horribly tangled- the Silk conditioner does a fantastic job of detangling. It smells wonderful, is easy to work through my hair with my fingers in the shower and makes a huge difference in my ability to comb out my hair without ripping it all out.  I&#x27;ve been using it for 30 days and am very pleased. It does not weigh down my hair or leave any build up, which is important since I have issues with dandruff/psoriasis/itching. Worth the cost. A small amount goes far, I use about a quarter size and have med-long hair, just below my shoulders. I wash and condition daily. The bottle is on the smaller side, but I think it will last about 2 months. (hopefully!)</li>
            <li> MY HAIR&lt;br /&gt;My hair is fine, straight, damaged, and dyed. I was looking for something that would restore health to my hair and preserve my color longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE GOOD&lt;br /&gt;- The conditioner leaves my hair light and airy, perhaps more than any other conditioner I have used.&lt;br /&gt;- It does a great job at not stripping out my color.&lt;br /&gt;- It smells luxurious and pleasant but not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOT SO GOOD&lt;br /&gt;- It isn&#x27;t very concentrated. I have to use as much as if I were using a cheap $3 conditioner.  In the past when I have bought a small bottle of conditioner in this price range, it has been concentrated and lasted a long time.&lt;br /&gt;- If you are used to creamy conditioners that detangle your hair be prepared to adjust to a sulfate - free experience.</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner. It does what it should (conditions!) and it smells very good and natural. Not perfumey.  I only use it a couple times a week. Depends on needs of your hair.</li>
            <li> My hair has never felt so heathy! I&#x27;ve gotten lots of compliments on my hair since I switched my shampoo and conditioner. I used the Argan shampoo and Silk 18 conditioner. I went from needing to use so much product to leaving my hair to naturally dry and look amazing. I am the happiest I&#x27;ve ever been with my hair outside of a professional treatment.</li>
            <li> I have a very thin and damaged hair. I&#x27;ve tried of many different conditioners and masks but they didn&#x27;t help me. My hair became more brittle and dry. When I start to use this conditioner, I noticed that my hair became more elastic and soft. I didn&#x27;t expect a such result from conditioner but it is better then all my expensive masks.</li>
            <li> My hair feels and looks healthy again.  So grateful for your Silk 18 Conditioner.  I will be sure to order again.  Thank you so very much</li>
            <li> This conditioner is AMAZING! I use it on my 8 yr olds very curly hair and it detangles immediately. You can leave in and doesn&#x27;t cause filmy build up.</li>
            <li> So I never just randomly write reviews unless I&#x27;m going to be getting something in return for it. I don&#x27;t take care of my hair...at all. I brush it maybe once a month (it&#x27;s straight anyways), and for special occasions I might straighten it (maybe max. 10x/yr). I also get it bleached/dyed blonde (my hair is normally black), and I know what you are picturing, overall it&#x27;s just not that pretty usually. I usually get my hair cut twice a year if I can (I have 4 children, 2 xl dogs, a cat, husband, and not to mention attempting to go to school full-time to one day become a doctor...obviously I would go more, but time and money are both tight. So, without more gruesome details, I can definitely tell when it&#x27;s time for a haircut. This starts around month 3  post haircut. I can feel it. Oops, a few more gross details about my hair and habits. My hair is really thick, but thinning as I have this disorder Trichotillomania (a hair-puuling disorder). I dont necessarily pull it out, but i individually pick hairs that feel just gross and feel their texture. So if you can imagine an unsanded piece of wood, and you ran your fingers over it, you can feel it or maybe even get some splinters! Now try running some fabric over it and sure to get snagged. My hair does this when I pull. I&#x27;ve tried putting it up, even in a bun, but my fingers always find a way in there to the attempting to feel the texture of the individual, thick and splitter hairs. If I take my bun out, it almost stays because my hair had gotte so frizzy and tangled in the process. It&#x27;s a nasty habit, and the more I pull, eventually some get pulled out, or pull others out in the tangling process. It&#x27;s a nasty habit I do when I feel it and/or stressed. Well, I try to use natural products on my hair when I can, and stuff like &amp;#34;wen&amp;#34;. I knew it was getting bad, and my hair was getting worse and worse. I looked up conditioner on Amazon, looking for one with zero sulfates (I don&#x27;t even know if that&#x27;s strictly a shampoo thing or conditioner as well). This one had great reviews. I got this (and several other stuff from &amp;#34;the amazon&amp;#34;) yesterday. And I tried it today. I didn&#x27;t leave it on that long either because here in California we are in a drought so I try to limit my showers to 5 minutes. It&#x27;s not that gross. I just start by washing my hair with shampoo, rinse, wet my loofah and turn the shower off. Then I put conditioner in and let that sit while I put soap on my loofah and lather. Then I rinse. Well, it&#x27;s dry right now as I type and am absolutely amazed by it. It feels smooth and straight. I can&#x27;t find any textured hairs. It isn&#x27;t frizzy or dry, but truly like silk. I&#x27;m not sure if hair ever gets used to a product and then loses effectiveness, but if it doesn&#x27;t, I will be using this conditioner for life.thing or conditioner as well). This one had great reviews. I got this (and several other stuff from &amp;#34;the amazon&amp;#34;) yesterday. And I tried it today.

            <li> I was expecting more from this product. I have probably used every product line at one time or another. First of all it should come with directions. My hair is double processed and tends to be dry. I applied it after shampooing and used my bonnet dryer to increase the conditioning. I was very disapointed with the results. Pureology hydrating products and even some store bought brands that I have used did a better job. I cannot recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great conditioner for my color treated hair. I&#x27;m hard on my hair every four weeks with an extensive coloring process. Maple Holistics is the best line I&#x27;ve found to keep my scalp in shape without color fade. Wonderful stuff.</li>
            <li> Excellent! Hands down the best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used. Quality products, from a trusted company, combine to make my previously dry hair luxuriously soft and fantastically fragrant. My wife love this conditioner on me as much as I do so thank you!!</li>
            <li> it does the work. I would like to compliment the service of Maple Holistics company.</li>
            <li> I just started using this conditioner and I have instantly noticed a huge difference. My hair is bouncy shinier and less frizzy. I love the smell of this product and I am happy to know that it is all natural.  I can&#x27;t wait to see what my hair looks and feels like in a week after using this product!</li>
            <li> My hair was very brittle and would break easily.  After using this conditioner once, I could feel my hair was much softer and hydrated. After using it multiple times, my hair would break less when I brushed it. Wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I recently switched to using shampoo bars, because I heard that conventional shampoos really damages the hair. I love it except I don&#x27;t get the smooth feeling I do after using regular shampoo and conditioner. Searched everywhere for a natural hair conditioner to use after using the shampoo bar and found this wonderful product. It does the job, leaving my hair silky smooth and I absolutely love the hint of vanilla scent.</li>
            <li> Liked it for about the first week... After I felt my hair was getting dry. Also, the smell was pleasant at first, but after a week it got very annoyingly repetitive/strong.</li>
            <li> This has to be the best conditioner that I have ever used.  I have long naturally straight hair that responds very well to this conditioner.  After realizing that my grays have made dying my hair necessary more often than I would have liked, I decided to go natural with the all of my hair products.  I used this conditioner after using henna (usually leaves my hair a bit dry) and I have also used it after just shampoo, and my hair looks like a magazine ad in both instances.  Could not be happier with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Wonderful. Made my dry ends look and feel healthy and shiny after just one use!</li>
            <li> This product tamed my super frizzy hair with a lasting vanilla scent.</li>
            <li> This is a great conditioner!  I have been looking for a decent conditioner for a while now as my preferred brand had been discontinued, and I had been let down by even the expensive &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; lines.  You can feel the difference as soon as you put it in your hair while in the shower.  My hair is overly processed and this product has really helped repair it.  The smell is also pleasant.</li>
            <li> The smell is pretty reasonable for a conditioner not overly powering which is why I bought it. I find it leaves my hair rather greasy after a day while other conditioners have not. Also it says homeopathic (I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s not homeopathic in any way) on the bottle, wtf is up with that? I probably would not have bought it if I saw that in the amazon title.</li>
            <li> This conditioner did AWESOME things for my hair. It was the softest it has ever been while using Silk18, my curls were soft and not frizzy, and required no leave-in product whatsoever! Definitely plan on getting some more SOON!</li>
            <li> I reviewed all the comments and saw how much people love it, and my friend let me use a small amount of hers. I&#x27;m totally in love with it too, now. I have very curly hair and it&#x27;s nearly always frizzy. I can&#x27;t believe the improvement with just a couple uses. Can&#x27;t wait to receive my order for my very own bottle!</li>
            <li> This conditioner is very good, but I didn&#x27;t feel the silkiness right out of the shower, like I would if I used some of the chemical-ridden conditioners. My hair is waist length and quite thick. I let my hair air dry after using this product (per my usual routine) and I was a tad disappointed that my hair looked pretty frizzy. Then I proceeded to use my straight iron to style my hair and I was pleasantly surprised at how soft and shiny my hair was compared to when I use other conditioners! And here&#x27;s a random fact--this stuff makes the best shaving cream ever! I found this out in a moment of desperation :D As for the scent, it is heavenly!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my granddaughter who has very long,  curly, frizzy hair.  When my daughter used it on my granddaughters hair she said it was absolutely  wonderful the difference it made in the texture and feel of my granddaughters hair was amazing.  So now I want to try it for myself.  I color my hair every month and it gets very dry and brittle so I am anxious to try this conditioner for myself.  I also have a lot of allergies so I like that this is an all natural product.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! Smells wonderful! My hair is so soft! My husband even uses it on his beard and loves it. Will definitely stick with the company. I can&#x27;t wait to try the other products. Another huge plus is its all organic and made here in the good ol&#x27; USA!!</li>
            <li> Not so bad , but will look for something cheaper next time...</li>
            <li> This is great for thick curly dry hair.</li>
            <li> In the last few months I have been working with a doctor to balance my hormones. Along with a whole foods diet I have also been swapping out all my old chemical laden beauty and hair care products to natural products. I found a product I really liked but it was SO expensive and I refuse to pay that much money for something I use every day and go through quickly.&lt;br /&gt;After reading reviews on this product I decided to give it a try. I am in love with this stuff! It is nice smelling, fairly thick, and really conditions well. It leaves my hair, shiny and bouncy and easy to style. I consider myself a &amp;#34;hair care snob&amp;#34; and I have spent stupid amounts of money on hair products in the past, but not anymore. In my opinion this is better than the product I stopped using because of the price tag that came with it! I am in my mid 40&#x27;s have naturally wavy hair, fairly thick and I straighten it daily. I live in Texas where it is very humid and this stuff fits the bill for me.</li>
            <li> My hair is brittle and falling out like crazy! So I can&#x27;t brush it very often which was causing hideous tangles. I used this product ONCE and I already see a huge improvement! I can run a brush all the way through my hair now without taking out a wad of hair!... It is also already so much softer after just one use!</li>
            <li> Love how soft my hair feels after using it. Vanilla scent is great, but a bit strong. I could see some people not digging the pervasiveness of the scent. Bottle is very small. Wish it felt like a better value.</li>
            <li> Good conditioner and a little is all you need which I like so the bottle will last quite a while. It smells wonderful!!! I would recommend.</li>
            <li> Wonderful conditioner...definately will buy this again...smells good too!</li>
            <li> Love it, love it, love it!!! Yes, it left my hair soft and manageable after using the Maple Holistics Argan Oil Shampoo, Sulfate Free.&lt;br /&gt;Just a small amount was enough. I could not believe how it left my hair silky and easy to comb through.&lt;br /&gt;I love it and will stay with this brand for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Wish they had a leave in conditioner, but The Argan Oil for Hair Treatment by Arvazallia is doing the number!&lt;br /&gt;Glad Amazon is carrying these products!</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I like that this company seems to work hard at producing healthier alternative products by using the best natural ingredients.available.</li>
            <li> I am impressed with this product. I have used it once and can honestly say I have never had such a positive result with any product. My hair feels soft and looks very nice. I am going to give it some time to see how it affects my hair over time.</li>
            <li> I was torn about giving this one 5 stars! Love the product but feel that I have to use too much of it to get the desired effect. Perhaps my hair is dryer than the average Jill, but I feel like the bottle is going way too fast, especially since it&#x27;s not super cheap. I don&#x27;t think the price is too high - but perhaps there should be an economy size available too.</li>
            <li> Overall its a pretty good conditioner and the scent is really good. Leaves hair soft and shiny. Also, its quite inexpensive and seems to have mostly natural ingredients. The only downside I&#x27;ve noticed after using this conditioner along with the dry hair and and flaking scalp shampoo from the same company is that it leaves quite a bit of flyaway hair.</li>
            <li> I love this and it keeps my thick hair soft without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> Recently discovered Maple Holistic products...and am &amp;#34;sold&amp;#34;....I tried the Silk 18 Conditioner....works wonderfully...softens hair after using the Degrease Shampoo and ...unlike other store-bought conditioners...is natural and not &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34;...hair does not lie flat....and smells great!</li>
            <li> My hair curls again! I have been using this conditioner for a week now and I am very pleased with the results. I use only this product on my hair and no shampoo or anything after the conditioner. I have long hair, medium thickness, with a pretty tight curl and after a week of using Silk18 my hair curls from roots to tips in consistent rings and it is very soft. The only drawback for me - I am very sensitive to smells -is that it has a pretty strong vanilla/sweet smell but others might like this so it&#x27;s just preference.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased Silk 18. I was looking for an All-Natural Conditioner that would moisturize very dry hair. I found it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tentatively added nothing to my hair after conditioning - no oils or &#x27;defrizzing&#x27; agents - to see how Silk 18 would hold up on its own. I let my hair dry naturally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is very soft and silky - and after 2 uses now, the dryness (friz) is about 90 percent gone. Each time I use it, my hair soaks the conditioner up, so I feel it will only get better with extended use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...And the smell - wonderfully pleasing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kimberly on behalf of Sabrina</li>
            <li> I have long waving hair down to my waist. Since I moved to Arizona my hair and scalp became extremely dry. I tried many hair products, but they didn&#x27;t work. This conditioner keeps my hair hydrated, soft, shiny and easy to comb. As a conditioner with non toxic ingredients I think it works amazingly. I will buy again!</li>
            <li> It works well on my dry hair...makes it very soft and adds a very delicate fragrance to it. It does not ruin my hair color at all. This company&#x27;s customer service deserves a 5-star, too!! Can I give them 6 stars???</li>
            <li> I used it as a deep conditioner. I put it on my hair and then put on a plastic cap for about thirty minutes. I normally have very dry coarse african american hair and my hair did become soft and stayed soft even after I washed out the conditioner. Now when my hair gets a little dry during the week I just spray a little water mixed with conditioner and hydrate my hair and flat twist it down and when I take out my twist my is back soft and tangle free.</li>
            <li> this stuff is fantastic.  smells awesome, and my hair is so silky and soft!!  makes brushing much easier since its so conditioned.  it doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down at all.  love it, will continue to buy!!!</li>
            <li> This is the first time conditioner did not make my hair limp and lifeless.  It smells wonderful and makes my hair feel inviting to touch which my husband does more often now that I am using this product.  Will definitely continuing using.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner. I bought my mom some too.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased to find this wonderful product. Silk 18 is it.  This product goes a long way, only takes a little to completely condition my hair.  The smell is very nice too.  I will continue to buy this conditioner over and over again.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with the quality. Fragrance is enchanting, conditions well with just a small amount and the hair is so much softer. I don&#x27;t often repeat products, but this one is a keeper</li>
            <li> After trying this product I have reordered 3. My hair feels very silky after use, and my biggest concern of having an allergic, itchy reaction did not come to pass. My scalp is allergic to most shampoos and conditioners so I sought something more natural. This product is a blessing to me.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. It lasts about a month with me and my husband using it every day. I started using it myself and when I don&#x27;t use it my hair is frizzy and annoying. My husband uses it because he likes how soft it makes it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you came on amazon to find a good product for a conditioner then you just found it!</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. It works best for me if I use it both as a wash-out and leave-in conditioner. It is not too heavy or greasy for my ultra fine hair. It makes my hair soft and shiny, and adds slip for great combability. I have used other natural conditioners before, and those did practically nothing. I like the vanilla scent; it does stay on my hair, although fades to almost nothing once my hair is dry.</li>
            <li> Soft Silky hair just as promised.</li>
            <li> Update: Maple Holistics refunded my purchase 100%.I have a bad reaction to silicones: my skin gets small red welts, and I bought this because it&#x27;s been touted as silicone-free, and I didn&#x27;t see any ingredients that are in my list of silicones, but within 10 minutes of using this product, I got my classic silicone-related welts and had to strip my entire body and head with a harsh cleanser to remove it. Maybe there&#x27;s another ingredient that causes the same reaction as silicones in this.  Aside from that, it smells great, and I wish I could use it. I&#x27;m not giving a bad review because I think the quality is bad.</li>
            <li> I really do like this conditioner, but goodness it&#x27;s expensive. I think it does a great job of pretty much eliminating static electricity in my hair. And I think it actually makes my fine, thin hair look somewhat fuller, which is great. However, my hair does not look or feel silky. Lots of brushing helps to make it feel softer, but not for long before it feels a bit course again. But overall I&#x27;m pretty much happy with this product because my hair is no longer full of static and it&#x27;s much healthier for my scalp and hair than what I&#x27;d been using before.</li>
            <li> Okay so... My boyfriend purchased this for me for Christmas, but I couldn&#x27;t wait to use it after I opened it and took a whiff. It smells AMAZING. While I was in the shower I was in awe of how silky my hair felt. It was literally falling through my fingers. I have very thick, wavy, frizzy hair, so it was a surprise that it made it so smooth so quickly. After I got out of the shower I let it air dry, it seemed like it was drying nicely, but then I woke up and my hair is insanely curly with a weird film on my scalp. It&#x27;s possible that I didn&#x27;t rinse it out well enough, but I&#x27;ve only used it once so I&#x27;m excited to see my results after I finish the entire bottle.</li>
            <li> I bought shampoo and conditioner specifically because my hair has,been breaking off and falling out. The shampoo im not very fond of but the conditioner is lovely. It smells nice and my comb just glides through my hair when I apply it</li>
            <li> So far I really like this conditioner- my hair feels very silky after but not oily- its a great balance! The smell is wonderful too! Some vanilla and other herbal scentss. Looking forward to trying their shampoos next!</li>
            <li> Best conditioner ever!!!!  I&#x27;ve been looking for shampoo/conditioner that I can feel good about as my family moves towards a more natural and chemical free lifestyle.  I&#x27;ve tried a variety of &amp;#34;eco and health friendly&amp;#34; products and been unhappy with the results (IE the product cost 3x as much as the Tres Semme I had been buying and worked 3x worse!).  I even tried lots of DIY recipes to make my own (same issue).  Finally I found Maple Holistics Silk18 Conditioner and can stop searching.  This is hands down the BEST conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used.  Why? It has a creamy feel and texture like a &amp;#34;traditional conditioner&amp;#34;, detangles and smooths my fine hair well without weighing it down, makes my scalp and head feel and smell amazing (like Vanilla; it&#x27;s not overwhelming but I can see why some guys have reviewed this as smelling too &amp;#34;girly&amp;#34;).  And almost as importantly, this is a reasonably priced product available on Prime :)</li>
            <li> Good smell .. made my hair fall out in hands full</li>
            <li> Definitely would buy this product again! I found it great for my hair health. Smells great and has given my hair a brilliant sheen.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product. All natural, smells amazing, and leaves my hair super shiny, and healthy after just one use. I literally want to buy a gallon of this stuff!</li>
            <li> This smells absolutely divine. It&#x27;s a bit of a thicker conditioner so I don&#x27;t use it every day. It leaves my hair smelling and feeling great!</li>
            <li> This product is everything I have been looking for. Not only did it hydrate and condition my hair it also brought shine to it. My hair is noticeable softer after just the first few washes. When I use normal conditioner my hair becomes dry and dull. However when I use this my hair becomes soft and easy to maintain. It also smells great! I look forward to buying more. I recommended this product for anyone with dry dull hair.</li>
            <li> One of the worst conditioners I have ever used. Tons of tangles,  No slip, my hair looked dull, lifeless &amp; limp with no shine,. I used a shampoo first, which I only occasionally do (usually I cowash). This stuff was a nightmare. I had to try and get out the tangles without breaking my hair. My hair is very fine and curly, and I usually don&#x27;t have to do much to get the tangles out. I usually comb it in the shower while the conditioner is in it, and don&#x27;t comb or brush it after it&#x27;s dried. That, along with some smoothing cream is usually enough to keep the pouf from exploding. My hair was a real mess! The only good thing I have to say about it  is that it smelled good. I also tried it as a leave in conditioner, and it didn&#x27;t have any notice effect except it took my hair longer to dry. THE WORST ever invented. Also, the bottle is poorly designed, making it hard to dispense the product.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this product... I can&#x27;t stop touching my hair. I am sold on these products!</li>
            <li> So far so good!! I came across this product when looking for an all natural conditioner for curly hair. I&#x27;ve only used it twice but my hair is very silky and soft. I think my hair lost a lot of ground after two pregnancies, but this conditioner seemed to hair brought it back to life.  It also smells amazing!  I give it four stars because I think the price is a bit much for the size of the bottle. I have a lot of hair and need to use a lot of conditioner.  I also purchased Maple Holistics Tea Tree shampoo for my husband and we both like that one as well.</li>
            <li> Awesome product! Hard to find products that are all natural AND work well, but this is one! After use, my hair is noticeably softer and styles more easily. Hands down the best conditioner I have used! And I love the scent (as does my boyfriend) - nice subtle vanilla.</li>
            <li> This is ok, but I have used better products that were less expensive.</li>
            <li> I purchased this conditioner along with the Hydrate shampoo for dry scalp and they have both been amazing! This conditioner leaves everyones hair in my family looking amazing without weighing it down. It also leaves hair So soft and manageable. I am so happy to have found this fantastic product! I can&#x27;t wait to try more from Maple Holistics!</li>
            <li> I wanted to LOVE it. I really, really did. I was excited about a more natural, made in America product that sounded so good for my hair. Another plus - my husband and I loved the scent.&lt;br /&gt;However, as far as actual performance goes - I only liked it. I don&#x27;t find that it performs any better than my L&#x27;Oreal conditioner, and the L&#x27;Oreal is only a fraction of the price.&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could tell you that I absolutely adored the product and will be purchasing it again. Unfortunately, I can only say that I liked it and this will probably be only a one time purchase for me.</li>
            <li> I tried the Silk 18 after purchasing the Degrease shampoo. Wow! My hair is super soft , shiny, and full, without being weighed down . I&#x27;m sticking with both of these products!</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive oily scalp  and problem with dandruff .this conditioner works great for me doesn&#x27;t irritate skin and makes my hair so soft i noticed difference after first use .smells really nice .I choose it cause the reviews are really good and don&#x27;t regret now looking forward try the shampoo.</li>
            <li> This conditioner has a gentle and fresh scent, and my curls are formed and not frizzy.  My hair is soft and conditioned, but bouncy, too.  I am excited about this conditioner--it seems to suit my hair.  I wish I had discovered Argan oil sooner! :))  I love that it conditions so fully, without leaving my hair limp or greasy.</li>
            <li> I bought this after a blogger recommended it.  I have thin, frizzy hair that also gets greasy quickly. After using this product once, the difference was incredible!  Super silky without being greasy, shiny, healthier looking, and much easier to style.  I have now been using it for a few weeks and, while the difference isn&#x27;t quite as drastic as the first time I used it, it&#x27;s still the best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used.  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I have been looking for an all natural conditioner for a while now. After seeing and reading the reviews here on Amazon I decided to give it a try. I am glad I did! I only used it a couple of times but so far this conditioner is amazing. It leaves my hair smooth without tangles and it does not weigh it down. My scalp is not itchy and does not dry out as fast; I live in the desert and it sure leaves a strain on my hair. I would definitely recommend this conditioner.</li>
            <li> The Silk18 Conditioner, by Maple Holistics is the best I have used. I have very dry scalp and have tried practically every shampoo and conditioner on the market, and this is by far the best I have tried, I started using the silk18 about 1 month ago with the Sage shampoo and my dry scalp is gone. I do shampoo and use the conditioner every day. It is a habit because I shower everyday.  I will continue to use Silk18 as I have ordered more. The Silk18 conditioner smells like coconut and leaves my hair looking like silk.&lt;br /&gt;  The package was easy to open.&lt;br /&gt;PS- It is sulfate free and all natural.</li>
            <li> I have tried many shampoos and conditioners over the years and this one is the best by far.  The product makes my hair look and fell great without weighing it down.  I love the smell of their products too.  It is hard to find healthy alternatives for a lot of the products out there. I have tried many and again this is my favorite.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and fast service.  I usually color my hair every 3-4weeks, and have dry, damaged, and frizzed hair. This hair conditioner is wonderful!!! It is thick conditioner, and don&#x27;t need to use  too much to get smooth healthier looking hair. You must try it!  I highly recommend to people with dry hair!</li>
            <li> I purchase this conditioner because I was looking for hair products without sulfates and harsh ingredients. My hair felt soft after using this conditioner. However, my african american hair type needs a conditioner that adds moisture and detangles as well. This conditioner did not do that for me that&#x27;s why I gave it 3 stars. If your hair type doesn&#x27;t need extra moisture then this product might be a 5 star product for you. I will continue to use it though and find something else to compensate what it does not do for me. Hope this helps ;)</li>
            <li> I love the silky texture of it. My hair appears healthy and voluminous.</li>
            <li> Works better, much better, than my chemical ridden conditioner. I love the smell, the feel, and natural approach of this conditioner. I will definitely be buying more. My hair looks better than it has in years. It used to be frizzy and dull with my anti frizz chemical shampoo and conditioner. Now, it&#x27;s the perfect amount of shiny, soft and managable without being greasy like some other natural conditioners made it. Absolute love</li>
            <li> This smells great. My hair seems to like it</li>
            <li> I have natural hair and makes my hair feel so soft after is use the same brand for dandruff shampoo.</li>
            <li> I really like using this conditioner. It really moisturizes my hair, but it also rinses out very well. A lot of conditioners I have tried leave a &amp;#34;film&amp;#34; which feels kind of greasy even after rinsing. However, this conditioner moisturizes and makes my hair soft without leaving a residue behind.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t  say it&#x27;s worth the amount paid. It&#x27;s decent conditioner for sure but the bottle is hard and makes it difficult to squeeze out conditioner.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product mainly because it has natural ingredients in it and I am trying to transition to healthier health care (&amp; beauty) products. I loved this silk conditioner because it made my hair softer and shinier. Mostly noticed the softness and it made my hair more bouncy too. Even my boyfriend told me my hair looked exceptionally nice the day I used the conditioner. Haha. I am excited to try their other products too since I know this is an honest company now. A lot of other natural beauty companies claim their products are amazing, when they&#x27;re really not, but I was very statisfied with my purchase here. The amino acids &amp; silk proteins really get to work on your hair and you can tell the difference immediately. Does not weigh your hair down and has a light, pleasant smell. I already ordered again :)</li>
            <li> Works for itchy, dry scalp, as advertised. The scent is okay, sorta maple-y.</li>
            <li> Made my hair super soft and it smells really good.  I can understand why some reviewers say the scent is strong but it really doesn&#x27;t bother me.  It smells like vanilla!</li>
            <li> This conditioner is absolutely amazing. It makes my hair manageable, Shiny and most importantly smell heavenly! I live by the ocean and swim in saltwater daily for the entire year! I can undoubtedly say this product works.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great conditioner. I used  this product with the Argan Shampoo twice. It worked very well on my asian hair.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is not too strong. It gives moisture in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I would give it a five star if the bottle was not too hard to push. The shampoo bottle was fine, though.</li>
            <li> Great find- a conditioner you can feel good about using! Enjoyed the scent and will continue using this line!</li>
            <li> This product, while probably works, can&#x27;t really be used.  They say it smells like Vanilla.  I would say this is a stretch at best, but probably, yes, this is vanilla.  It does, however, smell thick and putrid.  How can this be?  How can a product smell both vanilla and putrid?  Maple Holistics accomplishes this.  Usually the only reason to add aroma is to cover up another smell, which might be the only way to screw up a vanilla smell.  In reality removing a smell by dominating it with something else really just enhances both.  They would be better off letting their customers use cologne or perfume for their aromatic needs.  It is embarrassing to have someone else smell my hair with this product in it.  Still, it does, actually, work, so while I am looking for another product I will not yet rule out Maple Holistics.  They need to provide this product without the radioactive odor.</li>
            <li> best conditioner for think asian hair and it smells great!</li>
            <li> The package arrived in good condition</li>
            <li> I bought this product because my hair needed a deep conditioning badly and I thought &amp;#34;why not try something new?&amp;#34;, and I am GLAD I did. This product is amazing! I got it today and used it and let me tell you;after using it my hair felt so soft and looked shiny! Plus, IT SMELLS AMAZING I highly recommend. I will continue using this brand and buying more products 5 stars</li>
            <li> Absolutely outstanding. my hair feels great! I have normal hair and leaves my hair feeling and looking soft and smooth. Most importantly it feels healthy!</li>
            <li> Works well and smell amazing.</li>
            <li> I really love the way this conditioner makes my hair feel. I have thick, coarse hair that is also curly. I straighten it daily, so its pretty damaged as well. This stuff worked miracles! The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the smell of the shea butter is very strong. Its not a deal breaker though, especially since it works so well! I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this conditioner for about 4 months now and I absolutely love it! I have wavy-curly hair (in terms of length, it&#x27;s about 3-inches below shoulder-length right now, when dried and curly) and I&#x27;m long overdue for a haircut (it&#x27;s probably been about 6 or 7 months since I got one). And I know, I know...I should get my hair trimmed more regularly, but it&#x27;s such a pain finding a reasonably-priced stylist, who also knows how to deal with curly hair, that I tend to judge when I need to bite the bullet and get a cut, by when my ends become completely unmanageable and unstylable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mention all this, because about a month or two after I got my most &amp;#34;recent&amp;#34; haircut, I realized that I was already having problems keeping my hair styled not at my ends, but at my roots! Which definitely were NOT dried or damaged. At this point, I had been using Tresemme&#x27;s curly hair conditioner for years, but decided it was time to test out new hair products, to see if that could help with this issue. I stumbled on Maple Holistics while doing some online Christmas shopping last year, and decided that it was worth a shot to splurge on a more natural product, even if it wasn&#x27;t specifically a curly-hair product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flash forward 4 months to today, and I am SO glad that I decided to test out this conditioner. Even though I DEFINITELY need to get a cut soon, I&#x27;m having no problem styling my curls, which still appear relatively undamaged. Best of all, my hair just looks and feels incredible now! This conditioner has made my hair unbelievably soft, and now I even find that after I shower, my hair has that hair commercial-like shininess to it (which I honestly thought only straight-haired women got). Overall, my hair now looks better, my scalp feels healthier (I&#x27;ve started having less trouble with dandruff, which tends to be an issue for me in the Spring and the Fall), AND my curls are much easier to style. In fact, I&#x27;ve found that since I started using this conditioner, my curls keep their shape for much longer, so now I&#x27;m able to avoid drying-out my scalp (and my curls) with too many washes in a week. Plus, I&#x27;ve also started getting tons of compliments from friends about how good my hair looks, since I started using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d say, that only downside about this conditioner is that the bottle is a little bit small. I have to pretty carefully ration-out my conditioner-use when I&#x27;m in the shower, but on the plus side, this stuff is so creamy and nourishing, that I don&#x27;t have to use as much on my roots as I used to, when I was using other conditioners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, another slight note: if you don&#x27;t like sweet-smelling products, it will take a few uses to get used to this product&#x27;s smell. I&#x27;m really NOT into super &amp;#34;feminine&amp;#34; odors (for instance, floral, fruity, or cookie-based scents in perfumes or body products...they either make me want to gag or track down a bakery, because why on earth would you want to smell like a cookie or cinnamon roll, unless you have constant access to those desserts???) and this conditioner DOES smell like vanilla. Normally, I would hate this in a body/hair product, and it was a bit overly sweet-smelling for me the first few times I used it, but I&#x27;ve also gotten used to the aroma and I don&#x27;t mind it anymore. In fact, the vanilla scent is only a bit strong while your using the conditioner in the shower, but afterwards, the scent becomes very subtle and I don&#x27;t smell it at all, once I put in my other hair products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I would wholeheartedly recommend this conditioner to anyone with wavy-curly hair, or just more generally, to anyone with dry hair. It will definitely help to condition your scalp and, if you are a sometimes-dandruff sufferer, like I am, the combination of this conditioner with the occasional use of any tea-tree oil shampoo, should really help to get rid of any dry scalp problems.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine, but I have quite a lot of it, and it is medium-to-long in length. The lower half, and especially the ends, were looking rather dry and rough. I have been using Silk 18 as a leave-in conditioner every other day for the past week, and it has already made the middle of my hair much softer and more mousturized. My ends are looking better, too, but I think only a trim can make them as soft as I would like. I have been using Matrix Biolage for the last couple years, and this conditioner is surpassing Biolage for me.</li>
            <li> This conditioner really does the job of leaving my dry hair well nourished and soft after a shampoo treatment. Has a very subtle vanilla smell to it and definitely the best conditioner i have used so far. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have really dry, color damaged hair and I just starting using Maple Holistics Silk Hair Conditioner and have noticed a big improvement with my hair.  It is made a huge difference with my dry hair and given my hair a shine and more volume.  I also use the Maple Holistics shampoo which has been great as well.  Wonderful product!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few weeks now and it has made my bleached/damaged hair soft again. Iove that it is sulfate free.</li>
            <li> Amazing conditioner! I have baby fine hair and lots of it. This does not weigh it down or leave it feeling greasy or heavy.  I have been using it for almost 3 weeks now and my hair feels amazing! I will be purchasing more : )</li>
            <li> I dilute this conditioner with water and I placed it in spray bottle.  I sprayed it on my hair and left it as a leave in conditioner and works great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s silky. Wonderful product I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ll use it continuously. But the size is too small. I use one bottle within one month. It would be good if bigger size is available.</li>
            <li> I first tried this after using a friend&#x27;s conditioner when I ran out last year, but I never got around to buying it because I forgot what the brand was. Then I rediscovered this after reading a blog review, and immediately jumped to buy it. What struck me most was the lovely smell (like vanilla cupcakes!) and how it made my hair super soft for the next 2-3 days. I can&#x27;t speak to the long-term benefits yet, but I love that it has great ingredients (no SLS!) and comes in a sturdy bottle packaging. Would love to try other items in the line as well to see if they are just as great as this one!</li>
            <li> First off, it smells amazing. Not too strong for me. Secondly, (I&#x27;ve only used it twice so far) It seems to keep my hair/scalp more moisturized than others I have used. I have 3B curly hair, and it is hard to find the &amp;#34;right one&amp;#34; for me. I will keep using this one as it seems to be giving my hair what it needs.</li>
            <li> I have received this product as a gift as well as the hydration shampoo. I absolutely noticed a difference in the vibrancy and resiliency of my hair after just one use. I would definitely recommend this product line, and I will be purchasing this in the future. Thank you for loving my hair !!!</li>
            <li> the ingredient list is great, but i didn&#x27;t FEEL that my hair was ANY better at all, compared to typical conditioner. In fact, I felt it was sub-par. At least from how my hair felt. It&#x27;s not BAD, but it&#x27;s not great also.</li>
            <li> I bought this condition with the degrease shampoo. This is the perfect conditioner since it doesn&#x27;t grease out my hair. conditioners tend to grease my hair a lot so I stopped using them. After reading the reviews i wanted to try this conditioner and see if the reviews are true. this conditioner doesn&#x27;t grease your hair and it gives it the right amount of shine. my scalp is oily but my hair ends are so dry. This conditioner helps a lot and even if i put on my scalp, it won&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling. It is light and organic. I would buy it again and recommend it to all my friends.</li>
            <li> I was referred to this product by a friend and I absolutly love it !!!</li>
            <li> This conditioner is very good as advertised. I absolutely love the scent &amp; works well with the Hydrate Shampoo. My scalp issues went away &amp; made my hair shiny &amp; healthy.  Customer follow up is also outstanding. Will stock up &amp; continue to use.</li>
            <li> This has a pretty strong vanilla scent which I&#x27;m not crazy about. The bottle is also stiff I have a lot of pain in my thumbs and even with it stored upside down it is hard and painful to get it out. I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars though because it does make my hair nice and soft.</li>
            <li> Really nice conditioner, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Completely revived my hair in a way that left me speechless.. I&#x27;m truly amazed</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of treatments for my hair, and probably most of the brands out there, by far this is the best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever tried, it leaves my hair incredibly soft and looking healthy. Also it doesn&#x27;t make me break out like the other products, I assume because is all natural. I&#x27;m on my second bottle and I love it.</li>
            <li> Purchased SILK 18 about three weeks ago, started using it immediately and LOVE IT. Love the feel of it, nice and creamy, the smell is awesome but not too much (vanilla scent). Silk 18 leaves my hair feeling nice and soft. One of the best conditioners I&#x27;ve used, natural or not. I have a lot of hair, long and thick. A very small amount goes a long way. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is awesome! I have been using natural based and holistic shampoos and conditioners for about a year now, and none of them compare to Maple Holistics. This conditioner leaves my hair feeling so silky and manageable without weighing it down. It is hands down my go to conditioner. Words couldn&#x27;t even describe how wonderful this product is. Please take my word, you have to try this! I will be a returning customer (:</li>
            <li> I am really happy with this purchase! I have only used it a few times but my hair already feels a lot softer and smoother. I have been looking for a good conditioner for my dry and highlighted hair, and I am so happy I found this one!</li>
            <li> Amazing product! After only ONE use, my hair felt completely different! So soft.. SILK is the right name for this product. And I only have to use a very little bit for the effect (and I have very long hair!). I will definitely buy this again and again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the shampoo also.. another great product! Using only a little bit, and despite being sulfate free it suds up nicely and gets my hair very clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well done Maple Holistics!!</li>
            <li> Left my hair so silky and smooth.  It was simple to blow dry ,y hair after using this conditioner.  It&#x27;s all natural and smells food.  I would use this everyday if it didn&#x27;t cost so much.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I am so happy with this conditioner. After the birth of my second son, my hair totally changed and my scalp became dry. I purchased the shampoo from Maple Organics that is specifically designed for dandruff and dermatitis. Because I&#x27;m nursing I didn&#x27;t want any chemical products. When I saw the Silk conditioner, I decided to give it a try. The smell is great- not too much vanilla, but very warm and full-bodied. What I really love is that a little goes a long way and I can apply it from roots to ends and it doesn&#x27;t make my scalp oily. I will definitely be using this one again.</li>
            <li> Wow!  Amazing Shampoo and Conditioner.  I have sensitive skin and think I&#x27;m allergic to sulfates.  No more itchy scalp and my hair is so clean and soft.  It feels so naturally healthy.  Will be a returning customer!!</li>
            <li> Great product I&#x27;ve decided to go natural and stop putting unhealthy stuff in my hair so it can grow stronger and fuller and this was a gift to me and I love it . I would recommend if your looking for something different to give it a a try.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product!!! Highly recommend using!!  Does everything it says and more!!</li>
            <li> This is amazing!  My hair is so dry and it makes it so soft.  I couldn&#x27;t ask for a better product.</li>
            <li> I personally used the conditioner and loved it. I loved the feel of my hair afterwards just didn&#x27;t care for the smell.</li>
            <li> Smells awesome!! And my hair has body!!!</li>
            <li> This was one of the best purchases I&#x27;ve ever made. If you are looking for an all natural product that won&#x27;t gunk up your hair with all the nasty residue the big names do, this is the product for you.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair that is prone to breakage from heat styling, ponytails, Etc. I tried this conditioner for the first time a few weeks ago and I will never get anything else. Used as just a regular conditioner it de tangled my hair and left it really shiny and soft</li>
            <li> I received it as a gift ,and loved it ,I have been having problems with my hair and scalp and it really helps ,love the way my hair fills and smell.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best conditioners I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s derived from all-natural ingredients, which is very important ~ to avoid harmful chemicals. It&#x27;s also Sulfate-Free, which makes an amazing difference with the manageability of my bleached/damaged hair. I only have this conditioner by MH, but it works great with other random shampoos that I have lying around the house. So happy that I finally found something ~ most of the products on the shelves of stores are cheap and chopped full of lies. We really love the vanilla scent too!</li>
            <li> This is the best conditioner i have ever used. it leaves my hair so soft and smooth!!! will definitly buy again</li>
            <li> I use this along with the Tea Tree lice treatment shampoo you have and will not buy another conditioner unless I absolutely have to.  It leaves your hair feeling so healthy and tingly.  I can also tell a huge difference in my itchy scalp, it is no longer dry.  I like the smell of it afterwards too, it lasts for a long time and feels so good.  Definitely a good find.</li>
            <li> My hair had split ends and was very rough with no shine at all,I decided to give this product a try I cant vouch for split ends but my hair are much much more shiner and soft then they ever were.Love this product.</li>
            <li> great product, highly recommended for brittle hair. All the ingredients are just perfect in every way.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this!!!!! Made my hair so soft. I love that it is completely natural. My hair has frizzy problems and this Silk has helped out 100%. Will definitely let all my family and friends know about this!!</li>
            <li> Smells pretty good, I wish there was more information on the bottle though, I like to read while im in the shower</li>
            <li> Delicious maple sugar smell. Conditions without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> Despite the possible fake positive reviews for this product (see my other review), I still went ahead and ordered it. And boy, am I glad I did. It really has made my hair incredibly soft, and it has a really nice vanilla scent. I left it on my hair for about 2 minutes while in the shower, and the end result was my hair feeling very silky without being weighed down -- something I&#x27;ve found to be very difficult to achieve, because usually the more moisturizing a conditioner is, the more it also weighs my hair down. But not with this. I am very, very happy that I took a chance and ordered this! Maybe I have FINALLY found my perfect conditioner! :)</li>
            <li> It is a very good conditioner, i have been using it to help my hair loss(due to hormone change after labor). At first I feel my hair became very smooth and silky after using it, then after about two weeks I found that my hair loss has been under coontrol, I used it with Argan Oil Shampoo, it seems to work well together. One thing I didn&#x27;t like was the price tag for this small bottle. However their customer service was very good, they follow up with email to see how you like the product and offer you coupon for additional bottles you purchase. I will definitely buy it again!</li>
            <li> Terrible product! It was as if I hadn&#x27;t used any conditioner at all. Thank GOD for my spray leave in conditioner otherwise, I never would have been able to brush through my hair.  This &amp;#34;product&amp;#34; left my hair a tangled, knotted, fly-away, mess! Don&#x27;t buy in the the Expensive &amp;#34;Silk Hype&amp;#34; It Will Cost You. Cost You In HAIR and Money</li>
            <li> After a couple of days of using this conditioner, I noticed the effect it had had on smoothing the hair cuticle and minimizing split ends so that my hair wasn&#x27;t nearly as frizzy as it usually is without styling gel. I&#x27;ve already ordered some more.</li>
            <li> Got a chance to use this recently and for those with natural hair its great for the winter! it left my hair really soft and easy to detangle but because of the aloe vera in it, you have to watch your dew levels to avoid a huge poofy look to your hair. It smells awesome and the ingredients are great for those naturals that are really cautious with chemicals in your products</li>
            <li> I used to not use conditioner because I would not see a noticeable difference in my hair. I would always have thin, dry, and frizzy hair. However, over the summer, I switched to a sulfate free shampoo and began putting coconut oil in my hair. It helped a great deal! But once the winter came, my hair began to get frizzy again so I decided to use a conditioner again. I&#x27;ve used this conditioner for only a few days and I notice how shiny and soft it makes my hair. I disagree with others that say it smells too strong. I have a pretty sensitive nose, but this scent doesn&#x27;t bother me. In fact, I really like it. It&#x27;s a light warm vanilla smell that fades away pretty quickly. I&#x27;m excited to try their other products in the near future.  EDIT: My first purchase and the above review was from 2014 and I&#x27;ve tested several conditioners throughout the years, but this is the only one that makes my hair this soft and frizz-free. 3 years later and I&#x27;m still using it. That really shows what a great product this is!</li>
            <li> Works great but lingering vanilla scent really is  too strong. I&#x27;m not a fan of vanilla scent so its particularly obnoxious to me.</li>
            <li> Before this I ordered the Arvazallia Argan oil mask which had excellent reviews but it was so strong and full of chemicals that it started irritating my skin. I&#x27;m not sure exactly of it&#x27;s ingredients but something that strong couldn&#x27;t be good. Their customer service was great however and they returned the $$ knowing I wasn&#x27;t satisfied with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then ordered this product. Love the conditioner ESP knowing it doesn&#x27;t have those horrible harmful chemicals. I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s gotten rid of my dry frizz but it&#x27;s better than any I&#x27;ve tried and believe me, I&#x27;ve tried too many. Finally this one I can stick to. Smells great, doesn&#x27;t leave residue, controls frizz quite a bit and leaves hair soft and tangle free.</li>
            <li> Awesome conditioner that smells yummy and is natural yay! Finally! I have been looking for a natural conditioner without all the bad chemicals that actually makes my hair feels soft and this one does! It smells like it says a light vanilla scent it is yummyyyy. I order the 8 ounce bottle which was smaller than I realized and a little expensive which is why I chose 4 stars instead of 5 stars but it is worth it!!</li>
            <li> I wanted to try a product that was more natural and better for my hair.  I really like the fragrance and it makes my hair soft and more managable.</li>
            <li> I like this stuff and the Degrease Shampoo which works pretty well on my ridiculous dry (and somehow still greasy) curly hair.</li>
            <li> I HAVE USED THIS PRODUCT AND HONESTLY WAS PRETTY IMPRESSED. MY HAIR IS REALLY UNMANAGABLE FRIZZY AND DRY BUT WHILE USING THIS PRODUCT I SAW AN IMPROVEMENT.</li>
            <li> Worked so well!  I color my hair, swim in a pool and am out on a boat regularly in the summer.  My hair wasso dry that I hated even touching it!  But after using this just once, it felt so much better.  It is soft and I can&#x27;t stop running my hands through it!  And the smell is amazing.  I love the scent of vanilla.  Definite plus.</li>
            <li> I used this product for a deep conditioner and it works great on my hair. My hair is damaged and dry so this product made it a lot easier on my hair. After washing it feels soft and beautiful!</li>
            <li> I used it as a deep conditioner. I put it on my hair and then put on a plastic cap for about thirty minutes. I  have dry hair due to styling tools  my hair did become soft and stayed soft even after I washed out the conditioner. Now when my hair gets a little dry during the week I just spray a little water mixed with conditioner and hydrate my hair when becomes dry and frizzy.I really enjoyed the smell and how it took out all the tangles out of my hair. My hair looks more alive and less dull. I hope to try the shampoo next because I am happy with this product!</li>
            <li> I love using Silk 18 Conditioner from Maple Holistics! There are so many great things to say! If you are looking for a all natural product line, I recommend Maple Holistics. I have fine, thin hair with little to no volume. The ends of my hair used to always feel dry. After I started using Silk 18 the dryness has improved greatly. Now my boyfriend has long (for a guy) think, curly, and very dry hair. I catch him using my Maple Holistics shampoo and conditioner and he loves the way his hair feels. Clean, shiny, smells good, and over all I have noticed my hair isn&#x27;t as damaged anymore! Thank you Maple Holistics for making a safe natural product!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably a good product for certain hair types but didn&#x27;t do much for my curly course hair.</li>
            <li> smells so good and makes my hair feel silky</li>
            <li> It truly is natural. No irritation or dry scalp.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I have completely different hair types; hers is super course and curly and mine is fine and straight.  I bought the shampoo and conditioner for her as the sulfate free products coupled with oils are what is needed to keep curly hair soft and shiny.  I loved the smell and decided to try the products myself and I couldn&#x27;t believe how soft and shiny it made my hair without oil build up!!!  Pay attention to that last remark as I have the propensity for oily hair while at the same time it&#x27;s dry and brittle from highlighting it.  These products rescued both my daughters hair and my own!!  DOUBLE WIN!!!  Love them!!!</li>
            <li> My hair feel satiny and healthier after using this conditioner for a month or so.</li>
            <li> I loved it. It was very good. In first use my hair felt so good. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have thick and frizzy hair that is very susceptible to breakage. I spend a lot of money on my hair Keratese, Philip Kingsley, etc. This product is the best by far and for the price it is a steal! I bought one for my sister because this is a finding worth sharing. The only negative for me is that I don&#x27;t like vanilla, I don&#x27;t mind this one so much because the vanilla does not smell like fake extract but I would much rather a herbal or flowery smell. For the results I get I would use it even if smelled like fried onions :-) Try it!</li>
            <li> I started using this conditioner recently and absolutely love it! its very natural and you can feel it. I started noticing the difference in just 2-3 days - the conditioner I was using before made my hair very dry; this one helps retain the moisture much better!! I am looking forward to trying their shampoo next.</li>
            <li> I am a serial productist. And by that I mean I go through products like crazy, a new one all the time for basically every beauty routine. I tried Silk 18 about 3 months ago because of the product reviews, figuring it would be worth a try... and I have changed my tune entirely. My hair is silky soft and hydrated and feels better than any product I&#x27;ve used. And I&#x27;ve used the high end ones too. Definitely worth the money-- and the best part, it smells fantastic!</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the bottle it comes in. Very hard to get the product out.</li>
            <li> This product is really wonderful. I loved the way it made my hair feel and was easy to manage and style. I like the fresh clean scent .</li>
            <li> I have tried many natural conditioners and this is by far the best yet! It makes my hair so soft and shiny! Not to mention, it smells amazing! I would definitely recommend this conditioner, it will not dissapoint!</li>
            <li> I am a Caucasian male with very coarse, frizzy, dry hair. After leaving this conditioner in my hair for 5 minutes and rinsing it out, my hair has become amazingly soft and most of the frizz has disappeared. However, I do think the conditioner is a little pricy for the amount you get, but it does work so I will continue to use it. I totally recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I was looking for an all natural conditioner to go along with my shampoo I use. As dandruff becomes an issue quickly if I do not use a conditioner. I was very impressed with the product as it left my hair silky smooth almost immediately lessened my dandruff issue. I would recommend this product for anyone looking for a good, all natural, conditioner.</li>
            <li> I love, love, LOVE this conditioner.... and I am very picky about what I use on my 3A curly hair!  I shampoo&#x27;d with sulfate free shampoo, conditioned with Silk 18, sealed with coconut oil and was good to go!  I am really excited to try Maple Holistics&#x27; other products!</li>
            <li> Yes! Left my hair feeling amazing after only a few uses! Wish I could buy this locally! Will be buying this again!</li>
            <li> I use this in conjunction with their Sage shampoo and like it so far.  You just have to be careful with how much of this you use.  If you use too much your hair is very very limp.  I already have thinning hair (thanks to thyroid and hormone issues) so I don&#x27;t need something to make it flatter.  When you get the perfect amount for you, it really makes your hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product for dry hair.  My hair was noticeably softer after the first time I used it, and it is getting better with each use.  An absolute bargain - works much better than products that retail for 3 times the price.</li>
            <li> Loved the conditioner. Made my hair extremely smooth on the first use itself. And the best thing is that it has all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I am super picky about conditioners. I have long, curly hair that gets knotty. This conditioner does a great job!!</li>
            <li> I just loved the conditioner!  Wanted something natural for my hair and tried this, I loved it.</li>
            <li> Good conditioner, I like the fact that it&#x27;s sulfate free.</li>
            <li> I am loving this product!!!  It is far superior to chemically based salon brands - most of which contain damaging silicone ingredients. Do not use any product with an ingredient ending in &amp;#34;cone&amp;#34;. I learned this the hard way. Silicones coat the hair and prevent moisture from getting into your hair. THIS product, however is all natural and so healthy for your hair and for our beautiful planet.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair (2c and 2b). I have had an incredibly difficult time finding a conditioner that does not leave my hair frizzy. I also wanted a conditioner that was sulfate free to allow my curls to actually form since 2c and 2b hair tends to be thinner than other curly hair types. This Silk 18 did the trick. Sticking to a low poo regimen and using this twice a week made my hair exactly how I&#x27;ve always wanted it to be: it&#x27;s a lot like Lorde&#x27;s (the singer) on day one, then day two and three, after a quick combing, gives it smooth, rolling waves. I have just fallen in love with my hair now!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with an itchy, flaky scalp for as long as I can remember. I&#x27;ve tried every shampoo/conditioner out there. When I say every, I mean EVERY one. My mother owns her own beauty salon so I&#x27;ve even tried stuff only she can purchase. Nothing worked. When we FINALLY found one that worked, it got discontinued. So my search was on once again. I found Maple Holistic products and decided to give them a try. They worked! I use this conditioner with the Sage shampoo. The combination really helps my scalp.</li>
            <li> Love how this product is all natural. ... that is very important in my family</li>
            <li> This product is amazing and will continue using it as long as it&#x27;s available!</li>
            <li> This conditioner is great! It leaves my hair silky soft and easy to manage, even in the cold dry winter air. I find that the static isn&#x27;t as bad either, which is a plus! natural salon quality haircare for less!</li>
            <li> My mother in law gave this to me for Christmas. I love this shampoo. I have heavily treated hair because of bleaching and dying over the years and this product makes my hair feel like I have never done that. I would recommend it to family and friends.</li>
            <li> Using 18 silk has completely changed my and my daughters hair texture and my daughtets curly frizzy hair is now calmed and has a beautiful curl with no friz, we both love live it thank yoh</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful. I bought to use on my daughter who has think curly hair. Her hair is always hard to brush through and always so knotty. This product made her hair so smooth and easy to brush and also gave alot of body to her curls.</li>
            <li> I have extremely thick hair, I often clog shower drain because I shed so much. I used this as deep conditioner and it is one of the best hair products I&#x27;ve ever used. It left my hair very healthy looking. I absolutely loved it. I would buy it time and time again,</li>
            <li> Love natural products!! No harmful additives to dry out and damage hair!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so difficult finding a GOOD conditioner that works on my dry, brittle, frizzy, unruly curly hair. I have only found two shampoos/conditioners that help keep my hair smooth, moisturized and shiny and even easy to brush through. One was Wen, the other is Maple Holistics. Maple Holistics is very similar to Wen, so if you have tried Wen, I recommend giving this a try. You&#x27;ll LOVE it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also smells soooo good. I love how the scent seems to linger longer than other conditions.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is absolutely amazing. It smells so good, like vanilla, and it leaves my hair ridiculously soft. It hasn&#x27;t been this soft or shiney in so long. I love this sooooo much! :)</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner. It smells fantastic and makes my hair silky smooth.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry hair and love this conditioner. It leaves my hair shiny, soft and well hydrated!</li>
            <li> Bottle was smaller than I expected, but it does leave my hair softer and smoother. I really like this product!</li>
            <li> It would get 5 stars but I&#x27;m not a huge fan of vanilla.  Otherwise a very great product!  Makes my hair soft and silky!</li>
            <li> I wish the smell were a little stronger but it&#x27;s an okey product.</li>
            <li> I have long, fine, thin, fragile, dry, natural, pin straight, caucasian hair. For the last 3 years it has been really struggling, breaking, falling out, and has been extra tangley and unmanagable. So, I have been searching and trying EVERYTHING... My hair especially reacts badly to silicones and proteins. All of the &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; conditioners I have tried make my hair even more dry and brittle, but they do stop my hair from falling out (so that must have been a chemical problem) Then I found Silk18 on Amazon.  I was skeptical as usual, because I have tried a LOT of conditioners that have 5 star reviews, with no luck, and many of them made my hair worse! Someone mentioned in a review that you can get a free sample to try from the company, so that&#x27;s what I did.  And, WOW!  This is the best my hair has looked/felt in years!  The sample was enough for 2 uses.  I noticed a major difference even after the first use.  My hair is now shiny for the first time in 3 years, my split ends are almost all gone (after second use) the tangles are gone, it is manageable, no more than just a couple strands fell out in the shower, it feels moisturized, and best of all, it flows!  I can actually slip my fingers through it with ease! This stuff is amazing!  I am going to be really sad the next couple days while I wait for my full bottle!  I hope they make this stuff FOREVER!!!  I only have one complaint... I don&#x27;t like the scent. But many people do, so I guess that just depends on your preference/nose.  To me, it smells like a cheap fake vanilla candle.  I Love vanilla scents, but not this one.  But, that one con isn&#x27;t enough to take off any stars.  I will endure almost any scent for results like this!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to the world of natural hair products and have heard horror stories. I feel like I hit a homerun with this conditioner because it works great on my hair! I used it after washing my hair with Maple Holistics argan shampoo. It made my hair soft and silky. I&#x27;m very pleased! - Melissa C.</li>
            <li> I have very greasy disgusting hair. This made it smell like syrup, and being the fat man I am, this made me wanna eat my hair. It made it super soft, soft as silk. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Awesome product!!!  This is my new line of hair products.</li>
            <li> I like maple holistic conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;It makes my hair smooth and smells good!</li>
            <li> I have naturally course, dry, curly blond hair.  I have tried so many products over my 55 years that it is ridiculous.  I was never able to wash my hair and go because it was too frizzy.  For years I straightened it because I couldn&#x27;t stand the frizz.  I used silicone wraps, oils, gels, shades, hair masks, mayonaise, keratin,...anything I could think of but they did not work.  I have been using this product since February and it is amazing!!! I use it in conjunction with Devacurl No poo.  I put this in while I am in shower and let it sit for at least 5 minutes.  I rinse with cool water (makes is shine more) and then I put a quarter size amount of this mixed with deva curl leave in conditioner and the results are amazing!  I have been able to let my hair grow out now because it&#x27;s manageable.  I get compliments on it everyday. (not exaggerating)  I wash my hair approximately every 4 days and NEVER use a brush.  If I comb my hair it it is with a big toothed comb.  I touch up the gray at home every 8 - 10 weeks.  I love, love, love this product.</li>
            <li> Wow.  This conditioner is on par with the Perfect 10 brand for less than half the price.  Very nice.  I&#x27;m loving the results.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to tame ALL my frizz and flyaways but my hair feels so soft.  Barelyl any tangles after I&#x27;m out of the shower, and adds shine.</li>
            <li> Extreme itchiness from using this product. I initially thought that maybe it was the shampoo I used. So I then did a trial and only used this product without any shampoo. Itchiness become unbearable with more use and red spots become visible.  After few trials and solid evidence I stopped using it. Also,  I did not find this conditioner very moisturizing. Disappointed big time. I want my money back.</li>
            <li> This conditioner was brought to my attention via the Amazon bestseller list and after juggling between a few choices I decided to go with it on chance. I have to say I&#x27;m presently surprised by the results, not only did the conditioner smell great (love the almond) it made my hair as soft as my girlfriends! That&#x27;s saying something when she gets her hair done at salons almost on the weekly. So far my only quarrel with the product is pricing but if that&#x27;s what they can afford to charge it&#x27;s just the market for the time being. I would love to see larger batches made available at a bulk discount for serious customers. I believe they currently do have some discount for buying more than one bottle but I&#x27;m hoping for larger containers as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maple Holistics Natural Conditioner gets my approval especially if you&#x27;re not concerned with the cost (whatever it maybe while you are reading this) I look forward to trying more products in their line up.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this conditioner! It leaves my hair smooth and I love the smell. I will continue to use this product. Thank you Maple Holistics </li>
            <li> This is like the best silky hair treatment i have had in years, its just the perfect one for me and I love it. I leave on my hair for like 30mins before I rinse with warm water and it just leaves my hair super silky i really love silk18</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product!  I&#x27;m ALWAYS looking for products that can make my hair healthy, shinning &amp; soft.  I have been coloring, using heating products for years &amp; this caused my hair to be dry &amp; coarse.  After searching for random things on Amazon, I came across this Silk 18 Natural Conditioner &amp; saw so many great reviews, I decided to give it a shot.  Boy, am I pleased!  After just one wash, I immediately noticed results!  My hair is softer, shinier &amp; more manageable. Even though this product is not cheap, but for what it does I&#x27;m willing to pay the price.</li>
            <li> I used this product is slot of times, It treated my hair because it was damaged for coloring it and the flat iron. It&#x27;s really good, I recommend it to my mom and sister.</li>
            <li> My wife likes it and so do I. Outperforms most conditoners.</li>
            <li> My daughter has eczema and very sensitive skin. She also has thick, long curly hair. The kid shampoos and conditioners just don&#x27;t work with her hair type, so I needed a replacement for the natural hair products for young kids. This smells great and works wonderfully. Her hair is so soft that I purchased another bottle for myself! The only downfall when using it on small children is that I could not locate any &amp;#34;tear free&amp;#34; products in this brand.</li>
            <li> very good Can make  big size 33oz</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get mine from amazon but from 5 he company itself so my or ducts not listed . But I got a dark circle under eye cream. And although the smell will take some getting use to its like bleach in a bottle I love it already.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t work for me. Watery consistency, not very moisturizing. The bottle is also hard to work with once you&#x27;re halfway through the bottle.</li>
            <li> This is the best conditioner I have ever used. I have tried nearly every conditioner on the market ranging from top of the line to generic brands. I love this conditioner because it is natural, and has a wonderful balance of ingredients to keep my hair healthier than it&#x27;s ever been. I&#x27;ve started telling all my girl friends to use this line because it works on all hair types. While this conditioner is extremely nourishing, it never weighs down my hair. I get compliments regularly on the way my hair smells, because this conditioner has a delightful warm vanilla scent.</li>
            <li> I think this is a very nice conditioner; it smells wonderful, helps with tangles, and best of all it is all natural.  Have been pleased with all of Maple Holistics products I have tried.</li>
            <li> I too was curious at the tidal wave of 5 stars.  I am writing this review to tell you that, yes, they had a business card offering a free product for a good review.  I didn&#x27;t read the details, but it looked like it was a review on their website.  (Also, my hubs signed up for Amazon but he is bald so clearly would never need this product)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I read a 1 star review calling this produce bogus.  Look, everyone is different.  Everyone&#x27;s hair is different.  The product didn&#x27;t work for them.  I too am jaded to think people are liars.  But I&#x27;m sitting in bed typing this having used the product for the first time last night with my hair softer than its been since I was a baby (I assume).  My 2 1/2 yr old daughter has incredibly soft hair so that&#x27;s my scale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t be asking for the free product because I don&#x27;t need whatever they want to give me.  I honestly woke up with my hair so soft that I wanted to see if it comes in bigger sizes.  We are staying at our friends house for the 4th of July so I  had this (and the shampoo) sent here to their house.  My friend tried it and loves it too.  I was thinking about leaving the bottles here for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I came across the 3% 1 star review and thought &amp;#34;ah... Hell-o No!&amp;#34;  I&#x27;m real.  I don&#x27;t work for the company.  My review isn&#x27;t purchased and my hair super soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have the naturally curly syndrome.  I also love natural vs chemicals.  I&#x27;ve considered trying the &#x27;no shampoo&#x27; method but can&#x27;t bring myself there.  I thought this would be the closest 2nd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;True story.  The end.</li>
            <li> not really anything speacial but i like the smell</li>
            <li> REALLY WONDERFUL CONDITIONER! I&#x27;ve only been using this for a couple weeks now but I am a huge fan.  I have coarse, wavy, color treated hair, and my hair has never felt so soft or looked so shiny!  The last time I visited my hair stylist for a cut &amp; color, I had only just ordered Silk 18 and used the conditioner one time, and my stylist could not stop freaking out at how shiny and amazing my hair looked.  It stayed super shiny even after she colored and shampooed and conditioned my hair with her products!  She was so impressed that she ordered it herself that day.  Its a little pricey for the size, but I&#x27;m telling you, its amazing stuff.  And you don&#x27;t need to use it at every wash - its silkiness lasts.</li>
            <li> I really like the conditioner. It makes my hair feel silky, and it smells great!&lt;br /&gt; I like this product because it&#x27;s all natural, but it doesn&#x27;t smell like a lot of the herbal conditioners do, it has a nicer, more subtle scent. When I was using devacurl it was way more expensive, and it left my hair smelling super strongly of herbs, which I disliked. I&#x27;ve used this product several times now, and it seems like an affordable product for curly hair, plus it offers really great moisture for anybody with dry hair. This product can be a little bit hard to dispense, but that&#x27;s a minor problem as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
            <li> Hoped this would do the job for my dry damaged hair....very disappointed and hard to rinse out.</li>
            <li> This did nothing for my hair, but they refunded me with no problem... so they deserve some stars for that. :)</li>
            <li> The conditioner itself is nice but the bottle is horrible. It&#x27;s nearly impossible to use in the shower. It&#x27;s way too hard and doesn&#x27;t squeeze very well upside down. I have dropped it more than any other bottle in my shower. It&#x27;s not very user friendly. To me, there are other natural conditioners that&#x27;s not a pain to use.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t love this product as much as everyone else did.  The bottle is very hard, making it difficult to get the product out.  I didn&#x27;t love the smell nor did I think the conditioner was that wonderful.  I normally use Deva products, but wanted to switch things up.  I have to say in the end, I will stick with the Deva product line.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;m trying this product, hope it;s as good as the other reviews I have read so far, that;s why I gave thus producy 4 stars</li>
            <li> make my hair soooo much softer. it is like crack but for your hair and not bad for you...</li>
            <li> I have now purchased several of these conditioners and used them in various situations...leave in, rinse out etc. After figuring out the best way it works with my hair, I must say it is one of the best conditioners I&#x27;ve used. I have naturally coiled typed hair and live in a very humid environment so it has been difficult finding something that helps to ease frizz and keep my hair manageable. This works. Thrilled that I found this product.</li>
            <li> So glad I tried this conditioner!  I have natural ash blonde hair but it&#x27;s been through the ringer over the last couple of years, going dark brown, back to blonde and then even blonder.  I&#x27;ve also been growing it out, so over time I&#x27;ve developed a bit of a &amp;#34;tree ring&amp;#34; effect.  Look further down my hair length and you can discern points in history based on the color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joking aside, I was looking for a really good conditioner to help with my roots, fraying split ends, and overall hair health.  Silk18 did all of this, but it even helped with my hair tone!  I had a noticeable line where my natural ash blonde was hitting the more brassy, dyed blonde that was bleached lighter from the brown hair dye phase.  It seems to me that Silk18 brightened my natural, kind of dishwater-ey blonde and also removed some of the the brassiness elsewhere so I&#x27;ve actually got a nice even tone without having to run back to the hairdresser!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, my only complaint is that I wish they had a bigger size of this.  I usually buy my shampoo and conditioner in the large salon size pump bottles because I have such long, thick hair that I end up using a lot just.  And even though this conditioner does have the &amp;#34;little bit goes a long way&amp;#34; quality, I still worry that I&#x27;m going to have to buy these little bottles every once a month.</li>
            <li> So I have been using this for a couple of weeks now, let me start of by saying how much i love the smell of this conditioner and how my hair feels after using it.  It leaves my hair very soft and less fizzy.  I have used it as a leave in conditioner and as a conditioner that you rinse and I love it either way.  This is a great product that I will continue to use on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> Nice conditioner.  Not one who normally likes a vanilla scent but they&#x27;ve managed to make it actually pretty nice.  Not a super conditioning conditioner, but works well and I&#x27;ll buy again.</li>
            <li> I really wanted this product to work. Smells great very natural as wonderful ingredients however for my bleach blonde hair it was too heavy didn&#x27;t saturate and actually made it more dry.</li>
            <li> I use a few products and simply love them all. Wouldn&#x27;t switch for nothing. Love live live what my hair is looking like now</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! Not only does it fell clean it also leaves you smelling awesome as well!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Love this product leaves my hair so soft</li>
            <li> I have very course dry hair and this product made my hair very soft and smelled great made my hair stronger</li>
            <li> I received the Maple Holistic Silk 18 conditioner as a birthday gift in a beauty basket from my Mother and I thought this product was just wonderful. I have very long hair so it gets oily near the roots and dry at the ends. The Silk 18 conditioner balanced my hair leaving it soft and the curls so managable.  So happy to have found this fantastic beauty care product. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Okay so this conditioner is AMAZING! I would give it 5 stars but it is a small bottle (only 8oz), I have really dry/fried/frizzy/damaged hair and this has helped so much! I got some for christmas and wasn&#x27;t to sure about it since I have tried so many other ones that supposedly helped but I never noticed anything with them. This product though has seriously helped my hair become healthier and  less dry. I have noticed less frizz, and my hair is a little shinier than before. Oh and it smells so GOOD!</li>
            <li> I am so interested in trying this. I hear so many great things about it all the time. I am skeptical about buying before trying though.</li>
            <li> Love Silk 18 Conditioner!&lt;br /&gt;It leaves my hair soft, manageable, and smelling great!&lt;br /&gt;Customer service at Maple Holistics is awesome - very helpful.</li>
            <li> So far so good. I bought this conditioner completely unaware of the other products available. Truth is i was looking for a great conditioner for my 6 year old daughter and i to use. This has been working great so far, and i would really like to try out a shampoo to go with our conditioner. Our hair is soft and feels so good after using, just what i was looking for. It makes brushing my daughters hair much easier. I&#x27;m looking forward to trying the shampoo for itchy greasy hair! Love this product! Keep up the quality and price! thank you!</li>
            <li> Great conditioner! Made my hair soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> This product came with such amazing reviews and I have to say it does work very well but I was not overly impressed. Perhaps it is because I used the Tea Tree shampoo for my scalp prior to using this conditioner, but my hair did not feel soft and &amp;#34;nourished&amp;#34; after I used it. I have very thin, course/dry hair and, after my hair air-dried, it was still course and somewhat dry but it did have a beautiful shine to it.&lt;br /&gt;After I used the cleansing scalp shampoo, my hair was VERY stripped and brittle and after I put the Silk 18 on, it almost immediately softened and detangled. So, I will continue to use this conditioner as it works great ... just be careful on what shampoo you use prior to it.</li>
            <li> I have long, highlighted hair and this conditioner is my new favorite. Wonderful product!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It totally repairs my hair.</li>
            <li> Excellent product works very well and smells good</li>
            <li> Being honest like you said never used any of these products but by Reading the reviews I would love to try I have dry hair an I believe this would really help ty</li>
            <li> We bought our first bottle based on revews. And now we keep buying it becouse we really love it. My two daughters dont want to use any other conditioner, loves the smell ( they calll it &amp;#34; cupcakes smell&amp;#34;) and how it makes their long, waist line hair feel too.&lt;br /&gt;Just wish there was a shampoo with the same smell a and a bigger (value) size</li>
            <li> In the past I have tried different shampoos and conditioners. I turned to Maple Holistics because I saw the wonderful reviews. I am happy to say I am was not disappointed. I have been using this conditioner in combination with Degrease and Tea Tree shampoo. This conditioner leaves my hair as soft as can get. I have air dried and blow dried my hair and it leaves my hair just wonderful. I couldnt be happier. I have been using the product for a little over a month. I used Degrease the first month and now I am currently using Tea Tree in combination with the conditioner.</li>
            <li> Smells delish! Left my natural, coily hair soft and detangling was a breeze. I use it as a leave-in underneath my Coco Curls Moisturizing Styling Cream. I only wish it came in a larger bottle. This will be staple product for me.</li>
            <li> This is very good conditioner. Will be ordering more in the future!!</li>
            <li> I used it twice.  Hair was easy to comb through but was somewhat dry and very dull.  I have 4b/4c hair; I guess this product is not for me.  I&#x27;m going back to my old standby: Aubrey Organics Island Naturals or Honeysuckle Rose Conditioner.</li>
            <li> I actually bought this and the Winter Blend Shampoo and I have fallen in love with both.  I have long, fine hair and most conditioners weigh my hair down so I was forced to use other styling products to boost volume.  I have to say that this conditioner is the best I have ever used.  It only take a small amount (a little less than the size of a quarter) of shampoo and conditioner to lather up my entire head and my hair is to the middle of my back.  I don&#x27;t even use any styling products on my hair anymore and I can go a day between washes, which was never the case with other brands.  The shampoo has a minty smell but is not overpowering and the conditioner is a nice light smell that reminds me of coconut.  I typically lather shampoo and let it sit for a few minutes while I shower then I rinse and condition.  I usually don&#x27;t even let the conditioner sit for more than a minute before rinsing and it still conditions very well without leaving my hair weighed down and greasy.  I am so happy with this shampoo I will definitely continue using it, my hair is softer and shinier that it ever has been. I also have my hair highlighted and I have noticed that my highlights do not seem to fade out as they did in the past.  I know the bottles may seem small for the price, but this bottle has lasted me for 2 months--a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This smells like vanilla (ok), makes some of my hair feel soft (ok), but it makes my hair tangle like CRAZY!  It dried my hair out and made it more damaged than before. I have naturally curly/wavy hair. This was a big fail. Got a good quality argan mask on Amazon that was a bazillion times better.   Needless to say, I don&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Asian with black, thick and straight hair. This conditioner reduces the volume of my hair and make it easy to handle my hair even when it&#x27;s raining. I also love the smell of this conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have very dry, brittle  hair,i have tried almost every condition known to man..This product made my hair even worse..It became so dry it would break at the touch,and it was so brittle i could not stand to touch it or allow it to touch my skin...The smell is so strong,it smells like you have been dipped in maple syrup...</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Silky smooth hair after drying my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Smells good.&lt;br /&gt;Not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Small bottle.&lt;br /&gt;Very hard to squeeze the bottle.</li>
            <li> I did not care for this, my hair still seemed to be dry and I do not have over processed  hair.</li>
            <li> The best treatment for my dry hair!  Made my hair feel very silky and smooth too!</li>
            <li> Just started using the conditioner about a week ago that my boyfriend (CHRIS) bought for me, so far I really love it.  I have ethnic hair, so my hair is very thick and curly, since using the conditioner, it has left my hair soft every time and smells good.  So as of now I really love the conditioner. :)</li>
            <li> Smells so good and helps me tame frizzies. Excellent product!</li>
            <li> Great conditioner! Smells great. Leaves hair very soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. My hair has always been really dry, so I was looking for a good, natural conditioner. Based on the reviews, this product showed potential so I tried it out. I was quite amazed. It doesn&#x27;t make my hair oily and my hair feels really smooth after using it. I am also using Argan Hair Oil Treatment along with this so will find out if both of these products work well in couple months, since damaged hair takes at least that long to repair.</li>
            <li> I received the product and have used it twice.  It&#x27;s great, my hair feels&lt;br /&gt;healthier and shinier, but not greasy. A small amount of the product goes a&lt;br /&gt;long way; with other conditioners I would have to use a lot more to get any&lt;br /&gt;result.</li>
            <li> I started using this conditioner about 6 months ago - Desperate to find something to help my dry, damaged, brittle, breaking, frizzy hair.  Last week, my hairdresser asks me, &amp;#34;What have you been doing differently these past 6 months? Your hair is shiny and healthy. The texture has completely changed.&amp;#34; She assumed I&#x27;d changed my diet and/or added vitamins to my routine. I explained to her that the only change I&#x27;d made was a switch to Silk 18 conditioner (and Sage shampoo). This is an amazing product!! I&#x27;m 40 years old &amp; have spent a great deal of that time &amp; a lot of money to find a product to help with this hair-curse Mother Nature gave me. I&#x27;ve finally found that help! Thank you Maple Holistics!</li>
            <li> Hair was so soft, silky, and shiny after just one use! My hair was dry, brittle, frizzy, and breaking. Finally something that will repair my poor hair! And it smells amazing!!</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for my wife.  She was quite anxious to get it and try it.  In her words, she loved that the product came sealed.  You know that you are getting it direct from the manufacture and it has not tampered with - that is a plus above others.  It has a pleasant smell.  She specifically did not use any styling product to see the true test between just shampoo and conditioner.  Her hair came out silky and bouncy.  She will definitely buy this conditioner again and try other shampoos by Maple Holistics.</li>
            <li> I spent a few months near the ocean and I must say that it made my hair dry and frizzy. It must&#x27;ve been a combination of the salt and the harsh sun. This helped me bring my hair back its old luster. It&#x27;s very pleasant and the smell is really nice, but not overpowering.</li>
            <li> For years I&#x27;ve had a chronic, dryness problem with my thin, blond hair. Since using this conditioner,about 7 weeks,my scalp and hair have felt like new. Silk 18 is gentle and conditions thoroughly without leaving any build-up. My hair feels soft and smooth. Also my dry, flakey scalp has seen a huge improvement. With continued use I&#x27;m sure this is going to clear it up completely. I am happy to recommend SILK 18 to anyone with similar conditions or just as a soothing after shampoo treatment for delicate hair. I&#x27;m so glad to have finally found something that really works.</li>
            <li> Love it! My hair is so smooth and freeze-free after it and I love the ease it styles with. The smell is nice too, I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s too strong as other reviews say. I would recommend it any day to anyone. Love it and love the fact that it&#x27;s all natural ingredients!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good, but the smell is strong. It&#x27;s a musky vanilla scent that tends to linger.</li>
            <li> My husband bought this hair conditioner for me because I have dry hair and dandruff .. I tried so many hair conditioners but I felt guilty , I was afraid of the chemical conditioner but, at least it&#x27;s organic and cause no damage</li>
            <li> this was so nice my friend took it.excellent for damaged hair</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!  It makes my hair soft and silky with just a quarter size amount.  The bottle lasts for days even with daily usage.  And the smell is just amazing.</li>
            <li> I bought the sage shampoo and looked for a product from maple so as to have a good combination of products.after use , it leaves my hair softer and not feeling drained.thank you maple products for this, you really have no idea what embarrassment uve saved me and the constant itching I get from dandruff.thank you.</li>
            <li> Great product, made my hair feel smooth and it also has body</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been educating myself recently about all the nasty ingredients in beauty/health products, so I&#x27;ve been interested in switching to products without sulfates/parabens, etc. I&#x27;ve heard of the no-poo method, but I&#x27;m not willing to deviate enough to feel that my hair isn&#x27;t clean or conditioned. So, with that said, this stuff does the trick. I wouldn&#x27;t say there is anything special about the way my hair feels - it&#x27;s not silkier than usual. In fact, it&#x27;s probably not as soft as it is when I use conventional conditioner, but it&#x27;s worth it because of the natural ingredients. Plus, it smells great! I&#x27;m a huge vanilla fan. I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> Love love love this conditioner!!! I pair this with the Sage shampoo from this line and I gotta say that I am happy with the results so far. The scent of this conditioner is lovely. I am happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> My hair is long, very thick, type 2a/2b curly hair. It is extremely hard to manage and is quite dry and frizzy. I never leave it out, it is always in a ponytail because of it. I read a review that mentioned that Maple Holistics was offering a free product if you left a positive review. So I was extremely sceptical, but out of desperation, purchased anyway. I am so glad I did! They do offer a free item if you review their product, but if you read the website here http://www.mapleholistics.com/free-products/ you will see that the review just needs to be honest whether positive or not. I have tried so may different products and spent a fortune on my hair. So much so that my bathroom looks like the hair care isle in a store. I have only used Silk 18 three times so far but my hair feels like silk, my curls are not frizzy and weighted down like they usually are and I can actually leave my hair out! It actually slips out of my ponytail now instead of getting tangled up in the band. I was so impressed that I tried it on my son. He swims and the chlorine from the pool has his hair incredibly dry and flaky. After one use, his hair is so much better. Everyone’s hair is different but for the price try it, if it does for you what it has done for me you won’t regret it! I am going to put my free product offer to good use and try and get another bottle!</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner! It soaked right into my hair when I rinsed it out my hair felt like silk.  My hair is really soft and shiny! I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This conditioner smells delicious enough to eat! It is incredibly moisturizing on my long, thick, overly processed hair. I love how the bottle is BPA free as well.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a natural conditioner that actually leaves my hair knot-free and silky smooth.  This is it!  I have been using this product for a week now and couldn&#x27;t be happier.  I have long, thick hair (mid-back length) and generally need a great deal of conditioner to even get the knots out.  I have been experimenting with the amount of Silk-18 I need to achieve the results I&#x27;m looking for (since it&#x27;s pricier than conditioners I have purchased in the past) and have found that a quarter-size amount that is carefully combed from root to ends does the trick.  Using more makes it easier to comb through, but I&#x27;m looking long-term to save money.  I even started using this on my 6-year old daughter and she loves how it easily works through her hair and removes the painful knots!  I love that it&#x27;s all natural, free of harmful chemicals, and actually works.  I highly recommend this product and plan to buy it again!</li>
            <li> I like the shampoo so much so I thought I&#x27;d try the conditioner along with it. The conditioner is good and silky but its like getting ketchup out of a glass bottle. The container does not allow you to squeeze the product out like it is suppose to, therefore making it to difficult to get any conditioner out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice conditioner.  I have extremely think and unruly hair.  It works well without weighing down my hair.  I have to use quite a bit of it to really get my hair conditioned, but I frequently do use a lot with all conditioners.  I will purchase this item again.</li>
            <li> This Works great! My hair was straighter, bouncier and shinier after the first use. and the benefits persisted with continuous use.&lt;br /&gt;Better than anything I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I have been using this along with Argan Oil Shampoo for a week.  This is a lot like Wen leaving your hair smooth and without frizz.  I have thick coarse hair and this California heat and sun has damaged it a lot over the years.  I have tried and used so many different shampoos and conditioners but this one is one of the best using natural ingredients and not as expensive as Wen.  You also don&#x27;t have to leave it 20 mins which is ridiculous.  I will keep on using this products as long as I can afford it!</li>
            <li> I like this product but have some others that I like better.</li>
            <li> My daughter bought a bottle of Silk18 conditioner. I used it one time and honestly have never had any conditioner ever be as nice as this one. We are a very holistic family and we have never found a holistic hair conditioner that is as good as this one. We just ordered three more bottles to make sure we do not run out. My hair literally did feel like silk. And it&#x27;s so nice because it is such a &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; product. And, not only that, but my daughter received a hand written note thanking her for her order.</li>
            <li> smells delicious, like pancakes</li>
            <li> Work well, conditions without being super heavy.  Not a fan of the fragrance.  Smells like burnt sugar and vanilla.  It&#x27;s fine...</li>
            <li> Love the coconut smell. And make my hair healthier, also more smoothy. I don&#x27;t want to change to other conditioner now :P.</li>
            <li> Was skeptical to try the Silk 18 Natural Conditioner. I have long, curly, frizzy hair that is tough to get a brush through without a good conditioner or you have to use a lot. Only had to use a small amount and worked great!! Love the smell too! A little pricey but an excellent conditioner! 8 oz bottle lasted about a month and a half, not bad!</li>
            <li> Wow! I bought this with little expectations, just based on everyone else&#x27;s reviews. This conditioner works WONDERS! I have long, fine to normal hair, wavyish in texture. I usually use deep hydrating conditioners. This stuff, I use much less than I normally would, then follow up with my normal bit of moroccan oil... my hair had never looked better! i use it on my toddler&#x27;s wispy baby hair, and it gives her lots of silky body. This is such a great product... definitely worth a try!!!</li>
            <li> my wife tried it and she loves it. she said she loves the smell and the way it makes her hair feel. will re-purchase.</li>
            <li> So - yes this company does ask those who purchase to leave a review and in return you get a free product, BUT if you hated the product why would you want a free one? I love it! The smell is wonderful (it could even be stronger for me, but it&#x27;s a nice soft scent). But the real thing I love is how crazy soft my hair is! WOW!! I&#x27;ve only been using it for about 2 weeks, but so far it&#x27;s a keeper. The only downside I see is the price.</li>
            <li> The conditioner worked really well on my hair. However I really didn&#x27;t like the scent... It was too spicy (really heavy vanilla...). I prefer cleaner smells.</li>
            <li> I do not use this every day because it is a bit pricey but when I do my hair is noticeably silky and does not tangle.</li>
            <li> Sorry to say, that this conditioner did not work for me. It turned out that I am allergic to it. So I am not using it any more. I found a way with the Argan Oil Shampoo from Maple Holistics and coconut oil as a conditioner that works for me.</li>
            <li> I used this product and it made my hair feel sooo much better!  I have medium, thick, a bit wavy, and coarse hair.  I use this as a deep conditioner and has really made a difference to my hair.  It made it more softer and manageable!  Overall it is a good product and will buy again.</li>
            <li> For the price it is wonderful. I have paid so much money for hair products and now I ask myself why?</li>
            <li> I loved this product and looking forward to purchasing the shampoo! It was great for my long tangled hair and left my hair smelling fresh all day.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair silky and gives a natural shine to it.</li>
            <li> a pretty good conditioner. as it does smell nice and does a hell of a job. i would recommend this but the only issue ive had with it was the size. its a pretty small bottle and i find myself having to use a bit of it as its a bit thick and doesn&#x27;t spread the best. but that may just be me. i would recommend it till tho</li>
            <li> I bought their Sage shampoo for heavy dandruff and saw they had a conditioner so I purchased this. The scent of it is vanilla which I am not a fan of but I figured I&#x27;d give a try anyway. The smell of it is really nice and even after my hair dries I can still smell it which is nice. It makes my hair very soft. It lathers well to just like the Sage shampoo. Overall this is a nice shampoo but it&#x27;s really expensive. I would continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Was expecting to make my hair silky and soft but it made it more tangled and dry. My hair is very fine.</li>
            <li> I have very dry, color treated hair.  This conditioner left my hair feeling very smooth, even silky.  And I love the smell</li>
            <li> Smells beautiful! This product made my hair more shiny and manageable. Before my hair was dry, frizzy, and extremely dry, but after using this product, all of my hair problems were gone! Will buy more in the future :)</li>
            <li> Male, early 30-s. Never tried conditioners before, this one was chosen according to reviews on Amazon. Absolutely loved it, the scalp isn&#x27;t dry anymore in the morning (heat season), the hair is shining. Had no other expectations besides those.</li>
            <li> Great conditioner! I have naturally curly hair that is often frizzy.  This conditioner smelled great, and I really feel like it nourished my hair and helped control the frizz!</li>
            <li> I just bought this item recently and I have to say it&#x27;s fabulous, leaves my hair feeling hydrated but not heavy and it made all the difference when it dried, less frizzy an shiny. I love it!! even mentioned it on my Instagram page @tinytatz6</li>
            <li> My mother has breast cancer and we were looking for natural products to makeover our medicine cabinet. This conditioner offers all the things your hair needs and nothing that you body doesn&#x27;t! I will be making this my families new hair care staple!!! Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I have been using it with its shampoo for two times and I feel my hair refreshed! it&#x27;s so natural that you can feel your hair energized and repaired after every use.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner. Hair feels super soft and silky. Very similar to the effect of Aussie conditioners, but this one has no sls, parabens, and is actually nurturing your hair</li>
            <li> Best I have ever used. So glad i found it !!</li>
            <li> This is the best natural conditioner I have ever used. It smells amazing and conditions my hair without weighing it down. This will be the ONLY conditioner I use from here on out.</li>
            <li> I tried this shampoo/conditioner for my husband who has a lot of dandruff and really coarse hair.  He liked it a lot.  It really helped his flakes.  I tend to lose a lot of hair when I shower and blow dry, so I tried it too.  I find cleansing conditioners weigh my hair down after I use them several days, but I don&#x27;t want harsh chemicals and sulfates.  However, when I try natural shampoos they are very hit and miss.  They are usually either too moisturizing, or they leave my hair so tangled I can&#x27;t comb through it.  Truly, a little goes a long way with this, so I feel the price is justified.  The conditioner smells nice. Like real vanilla, not like cake.  It makes my hair manageable, but not weighed down.  It falls out/breaks a lot less too.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is great my hair is really dry and can never found a conditioner that helps as much as this. I only gave it four stars and not five because if I use itI everyday it makes my hair feel like straw so I use it 2 times a week.</li>
            <li> We live in Hawaii and my daughter swims in chlorinated pools all week in addition to lots of sun and saltwater exposure.  Her think hair looked like straw.  She has been using this conditioner for over a month and loves it!  Also try the shampoo for itchy scalp if you have a child who picks at her scalp; it worked wonders for us!</li>
            <li> Good but not as extremely good as I respected.</li>
            <li> I have fine, thin, dirty blonde hair and get it highlighted so there is some damage.  I was worried that this may be too heavy for me but it is not at all.  My hair comes out very shiny and smooth but still has bounce and body.  I love it.</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t write Amazon reviews, but I wasn&#x27;t a fan of this conditioner. I felt my hair was still dry and not silky or smooth at all. I left it in my hair for 10 minutes and still nothing.</li>
            <li> Smells good made my hair soft and shiny. My only negative is it kind of burned my eyes more then any other product I have tried but I would get it again.</li>
            <li> This product is AMAZING. I have very thick, but very fragile hair. After letting my stylist talk me into bleaching out sections of my hair for the first time in 14 years, my hair was feeling just about like straw post treatment. Regular conditioners do not make the cut, so I went on Amazon and searched for cruelty free under conditioners (under beauty) and sorted by average customer review. Since I have prime it arrived in 2 days. After using it the first time, my hair went from straw to silk instantly... I just made sure I massaged it in good, left in while washing/shaving/flossing and then rinsed thoroughly. I haven&#x27;t used a cruelty free product this good for my hair since ever because apparently, they haven&#x27;t been in production until now. Maple Holistics definitely has my business as a return customer. You just can&#x27;t beat the value. I feel like I&#x27;m using a much higher end product and the compliments from my husband as to the look and feel of my hair don&#x27;t hurt either. Thanks, Maple Holistics!</li>
            <li> I have very super fine hair and damaged from blow dry.  This conditioner makes my hair very soft and doesn&#x27;t seem dry any more.  I love all the fact that it&#x27;s all natural.  My hair seems to be easier to manage.  I always use it with their argan shampoo.  I will definitely buy it again and try different one from the same brand.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> My husband and I have been using this conditioner for over eight times so far and have definitely noticed smoother and more shining hair for both of us (long and short hairs). It would be even better if this product is 100% natural.</li>
            <li> improves dry, frizzy hair.  i use it regularly.</li>
            <li> Oh- I cannot stand these type of products where u have to shake the bottle upside down to get the product out of the bottle!! It&#x27;s so thick- it&#x27;s so frustrating! - not worth my time!</li>
            <li> I have coarse greying hair, and in recent months with more grey areas coming in, my hair has become totally unmagageable with cowlicks sticking up everywhere when I get up in the morning.  I have to mist or wet some areas to get them to lie back in place.  After using Argan Oil Shampoo just one time, my hair has been softer to the touch, and no more waking up with wild and crazy hair in the mornings.  It&#x27;s amazing, really.  I used this shampoo conbined with the Silk18 conditioner, and I am sold on these products.  I might also add that certain products cause me to have rashes and redness, so I am switching to organic, 100% natural products.</li>
            <li> I bought this conditioner, along with the shampoo by the same maker. In just one application, my hair was transformed from dry and brittle to soft and shiny. The ingredients are all natural and the smell (vanilla) is non-intrusive. I am a big fan of this maker now and will be buying their products in the future.</li>
            <li> I am currently using this conditioner in conjunction with Argan Oil Shampoo.  I switched over to using this combination after having tried several other shampoos and conditioners - some natural, some not - and the baking soda/apple cider vinegar method, most of which either made my hair too dry, or had the opposite effect and left my hair greasy and matted-looking by the next day.  I prefer to only wash my hair twice a week, and have found that with this combination, my hair doesn&#x27;t seem to need a washing as often as with some other commercial shampoos/conditioners.  This conditioner has a lovely, subtle vanilla scent, and while it is a bit costly, I have found that using only a very small dollop is enough, and I expect this small bottle to last several weeks/months.  The only negative thing I noticed (not sure if it is the shampoo or the conditioner), is that my hair seems very static-y, which has never been a problem before.  Still, I will purchase this again - it is definitely one of the better conditioners I have tried.</li>
            <li> THE PERFECT ONE! My hair is softer, thicker and FULLER! I do not use any leave-in treatments for split/dry ends anymore with this conditioner! Also, some time ago I decided to stop using hair dryer to make my hair healthier. And the interesting thing is that my hair takes less time to become dry and less frizz (no anti-frizz treatments as well!).Ans as everybody mentioned already - the smell is very very good! I like it so much and I think I should try some shampoo from the Maple Holistics.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and was looking for something that wasn&#x27;t harsh and would not weigh down my ringlets. I bought this not expecting it to be a miracle worker. After about 1-2 weeks of using it I can definitely see a difference. My hair is shiny and soft, and knot-free. In addition, it smells amazing! It has a raw vanilla scent, not sweet. Would recommend this to anyone with frizzy, damaged hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to give the shampoos a try next.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, it makes my hair so silky and soft. The smell is incredible like vanilla.  I&#x27;m never going back to Pantene conditioner.</li>
            <li> After years of damage (from hair-dye) and severe hair breakage (from low iron), this product has restored softness and shine to my hair!  It has an amazing smelling soft vanilla scent and completely detangles my hair.  I will never use any another conditioner!</li>
            <li> I have 3c naturally curly hair. I did a simple wash &amp; go using this as my conditioner and it managed to keep my hair moisturized for two days during this Chicago winter. That&#x27;s a miracle in it&#x27;s own right. I think this would make for a great deep conditioner.</li>
            <li> Best natural conditioner</li>
            <li> I have been using the Silk 18 for 3 days. I LOVE the fragrance! This alone is worth a try. As for performance, I have very fine hair and it does not untangle my hair quite as well as some conditioners do. However, it does leave my hair soft and not greasy at all. The fact that it is sulfate-free and has good ingredients is well worth it to me.</li>
            <li> Love the conditioner. I have a thick black hair and its not easy to find natural product that does the job on the thick hair. The conditioner leaving my thick hair soft and smooth. I&#x27;m very pleased with the result and hoping to continue using this product</li>
            <li> This is the best conditioner I have ever used. I only have to wash my hair twice a week. It smells good, my hair is so soft, and I only need about a quarter size and that&#x27;s PLENTY. I have hair below my chest and it really gets all of it and well. &amp;#34;Silk&amp;#34; is seriously accurate!</li>
            <li> I got a sample of silk 18 .and I love it.it took all the tangles and frizz out of my hair and I love the light sent of vanilla. Will definitely be buying some and change conditioner</li>
            <li> This conditioner is awesome! It smells great and does a fantastic job! Definitely a value for the price as well!</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and I have been looking for a great affordable conditioner. I think I have found that in this product. I have been using this for about a week and so far I love this product. It makes my hair feel so soft without weighing it down. I also think that my hair is less frizzy. It smells great too which is a plus.</li>
            <li> AWESOME! It&#x27;s really silk in a bottle.  First used and instant results.  My comb now glides thru my hair. It&#x27;s really good.  Love it and will continue to buy this item.</li>
            <li> Silk 18 is very thick.  Leaves hair feeling soft with great body.</li>
            <li> The smell of this is AMAZING!!!!! Works well also... LOVE THE SMELL</li>
            <li> My hair has never been softer, nor smelled so lovely. It hasn&#x27;t been this shiny since I was a child. I&#x27;m thrilled to have found this product. I use it in conjunction with Maple Holistics &amp;#34;Sage Shampoo&amp;#34; -- a combo that is heaven for the hair.</li>
            <li> My. Hair. Is. Gorgeous. I used this product because I am allergic to synthetic fragrance and needed better conditioning for my hair. I have a lot fine, long blond hair and my old shampoo was too drying. This made my hair soft and silky without weighing down. I used the Argan Oil Shampoo as well. I love this product.</li>
            <li> This is the best natural conditioner my family has used.  Our hair is soft and not dry or &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; feeling.  We have already placed our second order for this product.  This is a winner for us!</li>
            <li> More dandruff after using all Maple Holistics brand. More Itchy scalp and hair fall. Won&#x27;t be buying again. I wish their products work for me but it didn&#x27;t. I really don&#x27;t want to negative review. Sorry.</li>
            <li> Gives me the feeling of having an incense over my head, I expected a nicer vanilla smell</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful and leaves hair smooth and soft. Will definitely be buying more of this product!!</li>
            <li> I have dry brittle hair and i ordered Silk 18, my hair feels so much softer. It does not have the harsh chemicals so it leaves my hair so soft. I loved Maple Holistics product so much, i still have some frizz on the ends but i have only been using the product a couple of weeks now. i bought the hydrate shampoo and it just came in today. I can&#x27;t wait to wash my hair tomorrow.</li>
            <li> Just finished a bottle. Helped with scalp dryness as well as made my hair soft. Great product!</li>
            <li> Really like this conditioner! I have thick and coarse red hair. It is very hard to find products that don&#x27;t dry out my hair and cause it to frizz. This product helps tame the frizz and it leaves it very  soft and manageable. Plus, it smells amazing!&lt;br /&gt;Its a great price and I think its a better product than any of the higher end and expensive lines.</li>
            <li> both my 12 year old daughter and I, age 50 are using this and the degrease shampoo and love them. Her hair is oily and mine is dry and the shampoo barely needs a conditioner even for me, and both leave our hair clean, smooth, shiny, comfortable.</li>
            <li> Smells awesome and leaves my hair manageable and bouncy. I will definitely be buying this again, its a great product from a holistic seller local to me.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is wonderful!  I&#x27;ve tried so so many things to get my fine, thin, highlighted hair to feel soft again and this is the only thing that has worked.  Some of the products I&#x27;ve gone through are Kevin Murphy, Pureology, and Kiehl&#x27;s, and to make matters worse I have hard water in my house so I periodically use the Malibu hard water treatment.  This conditioner has given me the best results by far - soft, silky, shiny hair.</li>
            <li> I love the smell, it doesn&#x27;t leave any residue, and my hair is so much more managable. I can&#x27;t stand the feeling of anything in my hair, this washes out completely and eliminates frizz. Try it!!</li>
            <li> I have so many positive things to say about this conditioner I don&#x27;t know where to start. It smells fantastic, like vanilla and mint almost and the smell lasts in your hair, I love that when my hair blow in the wind I get a whiff of it. The way it made my hair feel is unbelievable, I have tried so many high end conditioners, deep conditioners, and hair masques and now of them compare to this! It made my hair like silk! It also made my hair so shiny and it just feels healthier. As long as this conditioner is around I will never buy anything else.</li>
            <li> I like this conditioner it makes my my hair soft</li>
            <li> I was comparing the ingredients list to the other conditioners, and by far this was the best. Aloe Vera is the second ingredient, and it has botanical keratin, shea butter, pomegranate, hibiscus green tea, sea buckthorn, argan, jojoba, and most importantly, silk amino acids. My hair is now silky smooth. A definite must have for any &#x27;natural-product enthusiast&#x27;</li>
            <li> This conditioner just seemed to work for my thick but fine hair. I usually have a lot of issues with tangling and frizz, but this made it a lot better. I love that it is sulfate free and the subtle vanilla scent is really nice. I will be buying more!</li>
            <li> I totally love this conditioner . I recently lightened my hair color&lt;br /&gt;and the conditioner has helped to keep my hair soft and not dried out at&lt;br /&gt;all. It&#x27;s also not frizzy at all. Love it!!</li>
            <li> I have dry hair and a dry scalp. Color treated and relaxed. WOW! My hair feels like silk. Not greasy, moisturized, and it flows! I am very pleased.  I read about others that complain about the smell, but, I like the smell.  It&#x27;s not over powering, and doesn&#x27;t linger.  I tend to perform a &amp;#34;product overload&amp;#34;, and overweigh my hair.  I don&#x27;t need much, just a little thermal protector, after I rinse out the Silk 18. My hair and scalp are happy, you&#x27;ll feel it, too.&lt;br /&gt;Also like the fact that it is natural.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair that used to be dry and brittle until I tried this product!  My hair looks and feels sooooo healthy; the results are lovely!  (By the way, I&#x27;m about to purchase my fourth bottle, so the results do appear rather quickly.)  Just to further help others in need of moisturized, beautiful hair:  when my cousin came for a visit she asked about what I was using on my hair... needless to say, she jumped at the opportunity to take an extra bottle of the product I had in my closet when I offer it to her in case she wanted to try the conditioner for a few days herself.</li>
            <li> I tried this product after trying many different products to control my frizzy fine hair.  This has worked wonders.  I have recommended it to all my friends and family.  My mother in law is now using it and loves it as well.  I also received a follow up email from the co. confirming I was satisfied.  I haven&#x27;t ever had this level of customer service before.  If you are looking for a great conditioner you must try this.</li>
            <li> This shampoo makes my hair so soft. It smells great, like a sweet almonds. Huge plus that it&#x27;s a sulfate free product.&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 2 years and absolutely love it! Gives my end the needed nutrition and makes my hair smooth, shiny and steel amazing.</li>
            <li> Over the past two years, I have transitioned my diet and products I use from traditional to organic and Eco friendly. I have long thick wavy hair, and once upon a time in my life my hair was soft and very very shiny. However, over the years between applying gel, hairspray, bleaching it, flat ironing it, curling it, I have managed to destroy my hair. I started to use Shea Moisture Products about a year ago and they did help some but I realized they would often leave a residue in my hair and I had to keep cycling their different lines in order to help maintain its benefits. Then, after very scrutinized and careful research and reading of hundreds of consumer reviews, I came across Maple Holistics. I am in awe! When I applied the shampoo is was light weight but did the job of making my scalp feel clean and hydrated, a refreshing feeling, and very easy to rinse out. Then came the miracle worker the &amp;#34;Silk 18&amp;#34; natural conditioner, this stuff is incredible. Mind you, I hve tried WEN and Shea moisture and never has my hair been instantly de-tangled and moisturizer! I typically have to comb my hair in the shower to maximize he de tangling of conditioner, but not with this one! All I did was apply and in about 10 seconds I could effortlessly run my fingers through my hair. Then let it sit and rinse and done. Refreshed, hydrated, moisturized hair, minus the residue. I&#x27;m excited about this new product please give it a try. Treat your hair well, it really can add or take away from your overall appearance and overall self esteem. I will be back to post a picture. Thanks to all and good luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mary M. From Tampa, FL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS. Before today, I was a review virgin, never written one in my life, read thousands but diet one written.</li>
            <li> This is a really great conditioner.  A little goes a long way and I love that it is natural.  My hair is soft and shiny and the smell is pleasant, even though vanilla is not an awesome scent choice, it is not worth lowering the rating.  I noticed that my hair is fuller looking after use and also that it seems to act as similarly to Biosilk for flat ironing.  I flat ironed with my Chi and the results were amazing without using any additional products.  That makes this product an all-in-one conditioner and heat protectant in one step.  Because I did not add anything else to my hair before flat ironing, it feels so much softer.    I am happy with this conditioner!</li>
            <li> *Update* I have been using this product for a while now and I LOVE IT!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not used this long enough to know if I Love it, but for the last week I have used it I do like it (reason for 4 stars instead of 5).  Leaves my hair soft.  Helps with static during the cold and dry winter in Minnesota.  In between wash days I use a dab of this conditioner to help with tangles and frizz.  I have fine, wavy/curly hair.  Does not leave hair feeling greasy.  Will continue to use and update review to 5 stars if I grow to love it.  I Feel good about this product!</li>
            <li> I wii not be purchasing this product again.  It looks great on your hair while it is wet, but when it dries, it leave a dull whiteish residue in your hair and scalp, makes your hair look dirty.  This product was a waste of my money!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice a change in my hair and I didn&#x27;t like the feeling after my hair dried. I waiting about a month of use to write this review.</li>
            <li> Amazing I have blonde hair that is always dAmaged n honestly works great makes my hair feel great</li>
            <li> Great scent. Love that is is all natural!</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS CONDITIONER!!!!!!!!!!  I recently switched to sulfate free shampoo and conditioner.  I did a lot of research, and took a chance with Maple Holistic products.  And well... I am glad I did.  Their shampoo&#x27;s are great.  But oh man.  Silk 18 is like heaven in a bottle.  I have always been a fan of Vanilla scents.  I in fact wear vanilla extract as a perfume (due to a perfume allergy... also have super sensitive skin... So if sensitive skin is an issue, go with this product.  Its safe.)&lt;br /&gt;Anyway... My only issue with this product is that they need to make a body lotion, or even a matching shampoo with this exact scent.  I will buy it in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li> My hair looks and feels amazing! What I needed for living in the desert.</li>
            <li> Very nice Vanilla fragrance that feel like a salon spa. Very thick consistency. Turns my hair shiny &amp; soft. I love to feel them afterwards. Tried various other conditioners but this showed best results. I will definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Natural conditioner by Maple Holistics sulfate free. Silk 18 has got to be the best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used. From just the first application it made my hair shiny and smooth and detangled. I love this and will be purchasing more of it as I run out of it. Love it!! Five stars!!</li>
            <li> I have been on a quest to find a natural shampoo and conditioner and after testing several of them that left my hair in TERRIBLE condition, I stumbled across this brand. This is the first natural conditioner that didn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling dry and stringy or extremely greasy.  It leaves my hair silky smooth. I would have given the product 5 stars, but I was disapointed with the amount of conditioner you get for the price you pay.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is the best hair conditioner ever. My fine highlighted hair feel silky and shiny  and feel so soft to touch even after drying them with a fan this morning. Wow..</li>
            <li> The smell is awesome. It goes into my hair with ease. It is really starting to help my hair look healthier. i love that this is an all natural product. defintely something my hair needs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely impressed by Silk 18, along with the Hydrate shampoo that I have.  It has helped my long gray, frizzy hair that is also fine. This, along with the Hydrate shampoo, made my hair so silky, and I did not have to use very much at all.  Plus I only left it on around 2 minutes in the shower.  You can leave it on for a minute or longer, doesn&#x27;t matter.  So this conditioner and the Hydrate shampoo will be on my list to purchase soon.  Maple Holistics seems like such a great company, and they will help you with anything and answer questions that you might have.</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying I have combination hair. I have straight hair in the front and coarse curly hair in the back. This makes it very difficult to find hair products that work for my whole head. I also have dry (like very dry) hair but I can&#x27;t go even one night without washing my hair because if I do my face breaks out! I decided to buy this product and the argon oil shampoo by maple holistics based on reviews. When it came I was excited and scared to try it. I&#x27;ve really messed up my hair with other products including the baking soda no poo method and had to do oil treatments that make me breakout in order to get my hair back to not feeling like pig hair(in case you don&#x27;t know, pig hair is very coarse and unpleasant). I read the instructions on the shampoo and did as they said.... I immediately panicked! My hair felt horribly dry and doll like! I put this silk 18 conditioner in hoping it would help a little and to my udder shock and relief my hair felt silky soft as I smoothed it through. I left the conditioner in as I showered and rinsed it before I got out. OMG!!!! My hair is softer than it&#x27;s ever been!!! I can even go a night without washing(instead I just rinse) my hair! No breakouts in the morning!! I&#x27;ve been using these two products together for a month now and am still so so soooo happy I tried them! I will be using these two products together for as long as I can. Please don&#x27;t stop making these or change them! They&#x27;re perfect just the way they are!!!</li>
            <li> Best conditioner ever! Turns your hair like silk. I also bought the moisture control shampoo and it was just as awesome. I just ordered some different shampoo and conditioner from this company to try.</li>
            <li> I have my hair bleached blonde so I can put different colors in it when the mood strikes. In southern humidity it tends to frizz a bit. I usually wash my hair, towel dry, then put this in as a leave in conditioner. It makes my hair easier to brush, smells good, and only takes a little bit in my extremely thick hair.  I also use it in my 3 year olds hair as a de-tangled. Will definitely reorder when I run out.</li>
            <li> my hair loves this product...I followed the directions that came with the product... end result my hair was soft and manageable no frizz and the smell....ohh la la I love it!!!!  ...  girls...give it a try</li>
            <li> I was super excited about this product because of the overwhelmingly positive reviews.  Unfortunately, it hasn&#x27;t done anything amazing for my hair.  It actually dries my hair a bit. and I can&#x27;t stand the super strong vanilla smell.  It gives me a headache.  I didn&#x27;t like this product at all :/</li>
            <li> The conditioner was just okay. I have fine hair, but a lot of it and it&#x27;s been lightened to platinum blonde for years. I only use organic products and was really excited about this - but Acure conditioner worked better for my hair. I wasn&#x27;t able to brush through my hair completely after using this product. I gave it four stars for it being natural and safe.</li>
            <li> I have very curly dry fizzy hair and this conditioner works wonders.  I love it and would highly recommend to anyone who needs to tame their hair.</li>
            <li> Did not find this product to be particularly better than others especially after factoring its pricing. The design and the hardness of the plastic of the bottle prevents customers from easily squeezing the conditioner out.  I bought it because I was curious what others were raving about and was afraid I was missing out.</li>
            <li> I am always intrigued by products with so many 5 star reviews and then there are very polarized 1 star reviews.  How could this be? I&#x27;ll tell you how....The company offers a free product on your next order if you leave a positive review. BOOM.  Anyway, I used this conditioner with high hopes considering the name (Silk 18) and stellar reviews. Although when rinsing it out my hair did feel silky, upon drying my hair felt very dry and flat. Upon waking up, (my hair is to my mid back) my ends were tangled like a birds nest. I&#x27;ve never been so knotted before.. I gave it a few shots but happened every time.. Sometimes when I see 1 star reviews with so much negativity I&#x27;m a little suspicious that maybe its a competitor writing false reviews but I don&#x27;t think so in this case. After combing my tangled hair out I really had more split ends.  I hardly return Amazon products bc it seems more trouble then it&#x27;s worth, &amp;#34;It&#x27;s just conditioner guys, just finish it up&amp;#34; but I&#x27;m actually returning this. Yep. The vanilla scent wasn&#x27;t so overpowering and awful, it was  totally tolerable.  This is a crappy conditioner covered with marketing buzzwords to makes one feel crunchy and environmentally aware. I can pat myself on the back but I can&#x27;t comb my hair. Maybe this is why so many in this sustainable community have dreadlocks.. Anyway,  amazing marketing by Maple Holistics, under performing product.  Maybe it works better on somebody with short hair but def not for me.</li>
            <li> I have used only one time, but so far I can already tell it&#x27;s a great product.&lt;br /&gt;Left my hair super soft, manageable and Frizz Free!!!! It also smells amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this conditioner.</li>
            <li> Not good product! Half the bottle has to be used to feel a small difference. Not work buying and way too expensive.</li>
            <li> It smells great (like vanilla). Leaves my hair smooth. I used it with Maple Holistics&#x27; Degrease shampoo. The shampoo reduced oil while the Silk18 kept my hair moisturized. This is probably my favorite conditioner. Ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product as a free sample from Maple Holistics, but I will be buying again and again.</li>
            <li> i absolutely love this conditioner it makes my hair feel soft and smooth. i have frizzy-ish hair and this made it really smooth and easier to work with</li>
            <li> I found this conditioner while I was searching for top rated ones, and I am glad I did. The customers reviews really helped me a lot. Now I can tell you, this product is a must have because my hair has never been so soft and silky like this before. Thank you Maple Holistics for such a great product.</li>
            <li> The Silk 18 Conditioner is amazing! There is no buildup left in my hair. It leaves my hair feeling very soft and healthy. I use this in addition to the Argan Oil Shampoo and the combination produces great results.</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner. It makes my frizzy dry hair feel supersoft and look and feel bouncy!</li>
            <li> I love the way it made my hair feel so soft and manageable.  I would highly recommend this product to those who want natural and beautiful hair without harmful ingredients.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  It&#x27;s a reordered product forever.</li>
            <li> It has lots of chemicals. I will check them one by one.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair really soft but omg that smell is awful. It&#x27;s like a cross between vanilla and baby powder. Eww eww eww just EWW. But... soft hair.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product, by far my favorite of the MANY I&#x27;ve tried.  I have long, thick, dry, frizzy hair and I&#x27;m interested in a conditoner that is safe for me and the environment.  Most products either don&#x27;t work or make my hair feel greasy.  This conditioner works wonders, making my hair feel silky and shiny without weighing it down, and I feel good about putting it on my head.  The fragrance is really natural, light, not overbearing and my husband loves it.</li>
            <li> Great conditioner but it made my neck break out. I doubt this is an issue for most people, but I had to give my bottle away. Other than that, it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> Wishing it were a larger size. Great product my hair has never looked so good.</li>
            <li> Wow! I love this stuff :) Can&#x27;t wait to share it with all my girls. What a lovely product. Cleans hair thoroughly.</li>
            <li> My hair has never been softer!</li>
            <li> Scent is way to strong for my taste. Leaves my hair very tangly. I wanted it to work for my hair. Oh well.</li>
            <li> This is my first Maple Holistics purchase and I&#x27;m floored by the quality of this conditioner. It smells amazing and leaves my hair super soft. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This conditioner smells so good (it smells like vanilla!) and it makes my hair feel so smooth and shiny. My boyfriend loves smelling my hair after showers and compliments me all the time. In addition, it&#x27;s sulfate-free which means that it&#x27;s healthy for my hair! I have tried other sulfate-free conditioners and they suck. They usually feel so watered down that it does not truly condition hair one bit. The Silk 18 conditioner, however, is really good.</li>
            <li> I have blonde sun damaged hair and tend to wash it twice daily because of my job. Needless to say, I abuse it.  I have been searching for a conditioner that doesn&#x27;t build up in my hair and make it look greasy. Silk 18 is it!  Although the bottle seems smaller than a typical store-bought conditioner, it&#x27;s well worth it and (for me) lasts almost as long because you don&#x27;t have to use as much. I&#x27;ve tried a few other Maple Holistics hair products and was more than impressed with them. I&#x27;m a total Maple Holistics convert! Well worth a try, and if you don&#x27;t like it, their return policy is stellar.</li>
            <li> Must try wonderful product.</li>
            <li> This conditioner has done miracles in the few weeks that I have been using it. My hair is a &amp;#34;hot mess&amp;#34; with the New England weather and the fact that I am not kind to my hair at all by coloring and highlights (oh, and the yearly keratin treatment to straighten my hair). I have decided to not fight the curl, kink and frizz but to honor and embrace it. I have been doing my research on hair care products that are healthy for me, the earth and my family. This product nails it- we all love the way it smells and conditions our hair. I also use the argan shampoo (fantastic). We will be using Maple Holistics for our H&amp;B mainstay go to products.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure at first if I would like it, but based on all the good reviews I took a chance and I&#x27;m so glad I did!  My hair felt silky immediately after I stepped out of the shower and I&#x27;ve seen a huge difference in my hair.  I have wavy hair and usually my roots are oily and the ends are extremely dry.  This conditioner made my hair clean, soft, and moisturized.  I HIGHLY recommend getting this and I bought the tea tree shampoo and absolutely love it!! I will definitely continue to use them both!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 3 weeks and I can say it&#x27;s worth it. It leaves my hair soft and very shining without all the chemicals. It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I really like this conditioner.  I am a repeat customer.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is amazing!! Without using other synthetic ingrediants it makes my hair curlier and smoother. I will be buying this again. My hair is not as knotty as it usually is out of the shower and I am SO grateful for that. I am very impressed with this conditioner, I only wish it came it in a bigger bottle.</li>
            <li> Love it! Best natural conditioner out there for the price.  Will never use anything else again but wish it was sold in stores.</li>
            <li> Returned it after one use because the smell was too overpowering.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised at the results after using this conditioner. I&#x27;ve got color treated hair and it&#x27;s also getting drier with age and a low thyroid condition. This product left my hair softer and didn&#x27;t weigh it down like other conditioners can.I put it on after washing my hair and leave it for about two minutes and rinse.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;I really enjoy this conditioner, I tried many different homemade all natural shampoos and conditioners, and never had positive results. After using this for a couple of weeks, my hair was so soft and smelled great! I had to use regular conditioner once after switching to this, it left my hair feeling gross and coated in nastiness. This is an amazing product and defintely worth the price, plus I only have to wash my hair 1-2 a week using this so it really makes up for the cost anyways\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Made my hair dry. Never again.</li>
            <li> Ooooo, the vanilla smell is absolutely DEVINE and I wish it was edible! Does a good job with moisturizing and as a tip I usually leave it in my hair for several minutes to get that extra benefit of a deep condoner! The reason I only gave this a 3 out of 5 stars though is because it is a PAIN to get the conditioner to squeeze out! I have the bottle turned upside down in the shower shelf and I&#x27;m hoping I can get some more of it to come out easier this way!</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference in less than a week! My hair is softer and smoother, less frizzy. My hair really looks so healthy after applying a pea size amount.</li>
            <li> It smells good, leaves hair soft, silky, and fresh. It gets the job done. It is much better than those store bought brands as they are full of chemicals.</li>
            <li> I got this product mostly for my mom because I wanted us to start trying some organic products. She loves it! From the the fact that its organic and the way it leaves her hair feeling to the smell. I&#x27;ve tried it myself and i would have to agree with her. I&#x27;m a guy so i don&#x27;t focus to much on taking care of my hair haha. But I really do like the way it leaves your hair feeling. This is actually the second product i got from Maple Holistics a long with their Sage shampoo. By the way, If You have issues with dandruff, the Sage shampoo is another product I would highly recommend you try. In my opinion, both the shampoo and the Silk 18 conditioner seam to complement each other really well. I would also recommend checking out their websites to get a better understanding on what products best fit your needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WEB SITE:  http://www.mapleholistics.com</li>
            <li> I am so happy I found this product! I had been having problems with my hair due to me bleaching it last year and it seemed like other products I tried just seemed to make the damage worse. Also it seemed like near my scalp was constantly oily, but I usually only apply the conditioner to my ends. I bought this conditioner and the Argan Oil Shampoo they offer and can see a dramatic difference in my hair from just using it for 3 days. It&#x27;s much more fuller and it&#x27;s not oily at the top anymore. My hair looks almost as good as if i just left the salon. But it&#x27;s better because it&#x27;s sulfate free and made with so many good ingredients for your hair! I&#x27;m very happy to have found this product and will continue using it.</li>
            <li> Nice conditioner, not too heavy.</li>
            <li> Great all natural conditioner and not expensive at all when compared to similar products.  Will order again!</li>
            <li> I tried this conditioner with shampoo for dry hair and flaking scalp in the hope of healing peeling, itchy open sores that  I can not get a diagnosis from any doctor. A dermatology PA prescribed greasy creams that made it look like I never washed my hair. Some thongs helped my scalp and left my hair a disaster or aggravated my scalp condition and left my hair feeling great. I needed both; a happy healthy scalp and great hair. Thank you Maple Holistics! I finally have what I want and deserve, a healthy scalp and beautiful hair! I highly recommend Maple Holistic products!!!;)</li>
            <li> This conditioner has transformed my unmanageable hair from frizzy and dry to healthy looking! My hair is so soft and shiny, there&#x27;s a lot less frizz going on, and I feel like my waves have been enhanced in a good way. Will be buying more of their products for sure. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Loved this conditioner! It left my curls bouncy and moisturized. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> my son, 26 years old recently mentioned he had an uncontrollable dandruff problem, and nothing he tried worked.  I wanted to help and went to my favorite source - Amazon.  I sorted by customer reviews and came to this.  He picked it up only a week or so ago, and texted this morning &amp;#34;That dandruff conditioner is awesome! Almost totally dandruff free already&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;so, there you have it</li>
            <li> This conditioner left my hair silky soft and manageable.  Make sure you leave it on for at least 2 minutes to get the most silkiness!</li>
            <li> This conditioner is awesome. It works well for my naturally thick hair and doesn&#x27;t leave the hair oily/greasy. Despite that it works well and really does leave my hair feeling silky, my favorite part is the smell. It smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> Not great at detangling</li>
            <li> The conditioner sure has a nice smell and leaves my hair soft and manageable. But sometimes 2 out of 5 times i felt the hair is soft but when i run my fingers through my hair it was kind of rough. But the outer touch was soft. I know this is weird but i thought may be its just because of the way i used the conditioner. Hoping i dont face the same issue again. But overall i felt its a good product but felt it to be bit expensive as it really hasnt worked wonders.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. I tried it based on the reviews and it didn&#x27;t disappoint!  I have natural loose curls that tend to frizz on a daily basis. I was using another natural conditioner but it felt heavy and had an odd smell to it.  After using Silk 18, I highly doubt I will try anything else. It rinses clean with no build up and the vanilla scent is wonderful. It is strong at first but slightly fades during the duration of the day with a lingering scent of vanilla that I love. My hair feels lightweight and is frizz free, while my curls stay light and bouncy. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Works very well for me, makes my hair softer, but doesn&#x27;t help control my frizzyness very much, the smell is pretty neutral too me.</li>
            <li> It  was  not easy nowadays for me to find hair products that have no toxic ingredients in them and work quality  on hair. Fortunately, I found my brand and my products: Maple Holistics and 18 Silk Conditioner. I use this conditioner  with Argan Oil Shampoo -  by Maple Holistics, too. My experience includes many different shampoos and conditioners: some good, some not so. I continued my search, because something has not reached me. And I did  not give up until I found exactly what I was looking for: Maple Holistics and their products. I would like to ask  is it  possible the  products to be sold in larger containers?</li>
            <li> Hands down, this is the best conditioner I have ever used! The product works wonders! I am so thankful to have such a great product. I have shorter hair that was starting to die by the wrong products I was and wasn&#x27;t using. It has been around a week of using the conditioner and my hair has noticeably became so much more healthy. I am 100% pleased! Oh and the scent is amazing too!</li>
            <li> This conditioner leaves my hair with so much bounce and body. It is all natural and really shows. Love supporting small business, especially when the results are so great!</li>
            <li> This Silk 18 is perfect for my dry and curly hair.  The ingredients are safe and well thought out.  It has a light pleasant scent.  There is no build-up or residue left in the hair.  I use along with Cantu Shea butter hair silk when my hair is in need of double help as curly hair can be hard to manage at times.  I  apply this product as a leave-in conditioner on wet hair mostly.  However, it does work on dry hair for a little extra moisture.  This natural conditioner is my favorite so far.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the bottle is too small, especially for daily use. I use only every other day.</li>
            <li> This conditioner made my hair manageable,soft and really pleasant to touch. It has never had so much volume.&lt;br /&gt;I really love this product. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> 5 stars! This product is fantastic! My hair is more manageable and super smooth with this product. I&#x27;ve really noticed a transformation from my once unruly, super thick and curly hair. People have noticed the difference. I also color my hair, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to affect that either. Just ordered 2 more bottles!</li>
            <li> I have really frizzy hair, and I was looking for a product to help me deal with it. This is an amazing conditioner and it smells really good. I also bought the shampoo, and the experience has been amazing. My hair feels softer, shinier, and more important, less frizzy.</li>
            <li> This Natural Condition Silk 18 is OK.  I like the vanilla smell.  It leaves my hair fairly smooth and silky.  But, I am not sure I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> I received the Silk18 conditioner in the mail yesterday and used it last night for the first time. My hair is extremely thick, and as a consequence, can get very frizzy. It&#x27;s medium length - about two inches below my shoulders - and I heavy bangs. My issue with other conditioners has always been that when I&#x27;ve used them my hair has felt slimy and heavy - like the product was weighing down my hair. Also, my top layer of hair always seemed to be moisturized but the bottom layer - especially at the nape of my neck - remained slightly brittle and would tangle very easily.   I&#x27;ve been looking for a natural conditioner without many chemicals to use on my hair. After reading the reviews and researching, I decided to order Silk18 from Maple Holistics. I&#x27;m glad I did. As I said before, I&#x27;ve only used it once, but already my hair feels soft to the touch, light, moisturized, not greasy AND the bottom layer no longer feels brittle. I didn&#x27;t have time to blow dry my hair last night and fell asleep with it slightly wet. When I woke up, I was expecting a monstrous beehive. Instead, my hair was laying soft and shiny. If this is how one use looks like than I cannot wait to see what my hair looks like in a month. I&#x27;m also using a natural, sulfate free shampoo in combination and I would recommend everyone do this. We need to move away from chemicals and stick to what our hair and bodies need: natural ingredients that moisturize and protect.  I&#x27;ll update this review in about a month to let everyone know how I like it then, but right now, I am extremely pleased! So happy to recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Synthetic smell. Did leave hair soft. Not natural or holistic like at all.</li>
            <li> Not good as the reviews said .. It didn&#x27;t work even a little bit .. And it is very small .. It gone after one week</li>
            <li> Been using this product for a few weeks now and I must say, it is THE BEST conditioner I have ever used. I could tell a difference right away, keeping my hair shiny and soft. I will definitely be buying this again!</li>
            <li> I started using this at the same time as Maple Holistics Argan Oil Shampoo about a month ago and felt like this one just wasn&#x27;t a good fit for me. Overall, I&#x27;m impressed w/the quality of the products made by this company but this particular shampoo left my hair feeling a bit limp and flat.</li>
            <li> I like this conditioner.  It is thick and does help my hair feel softer.  The older I get the more coarse and curly my hair has become.  It is mid-back long and it takes a lot of conditioner to cover all that hair so I only get about 4 uses out of a bottle but at $13 a bottle it is relatively low cost per use.  I could not afford to use it for everyday. I like the scent.  I leave it in my hair as long as possible.  Sometimes overnight.  Does not leave my hair weighed down. Product rinses out nicely.  I will buy it again.  If I had shorter hair I probably wouldn&#x27;t need such a dramatic conditioner because it wouldn&#x27;t be as damaged as it is but then I could use less and use it more often.  I really like the product and would recommend it if you have dry hair and want it to feel softer.</li>
            <li> I love this!  smells so good and makes my hair nice and soft!  The customer service is also great with this company.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had much dandruff since I started using it. But man the fragrance is extremely over powering.</li>
            <li> Excellent product!  Leaves my hair manageable and shiny!</li>
            <li> Loved it! Perfect mate for the shampoo!</li>
            <li> I bought this together with the Sage shampoo with the hope that I could tame some scalp itchiness and frizz. Both my goals were accomplished and now my hair is silky soft and tamed! I also love the natural, subtle vanilla scent this conditioner leaves. I will purchase this again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint that I have is that it is difficult to brush my hair after dowel drying. I have found a leave-in conditioner/detangler helps with that.</li>
            <li> Hands down the BEST non-greasy, no residue, detangling conditioner ever!!!!  I have bra band length coarse, thick, naturally curly, dark brown hair that has been highlighted for the past two years and is now mostly blonde.  I also ride along on our motorcycles and drive the convertible and let my hair blow freely in the wind.  I&#x27;ve also been known to wake up after a long night with some pretty significant &#x27;bed head&#x27;.  Several days of the week my hair will literally be matted into clumps that I cannot even pull apart with my fingers, let alone think about getting a brush through.  After trying waaaaayyy too many conditioners, I had finally resolved myself to an over the counter brand that if I used half cup at a time, I could manage to work through and detangle my hair in about 10 minutes in the shower.  Then, the last two times I&#x27;ve had my hair colored, my stylist suggested he do a deep conditioning treatment to help strengthen my hair.  Well, this got me thinking that instead of spending $25 on salon treatments, I could probably find something I could use at home.  After reading the reviews, I decided to try Silk 18 and one other brand and from the first time I used it, I was in LOVE.  This is simply the best conditioner I have ever used.  It not only detangles my hair, but doesn&#x27;t leave any sort of greasy film behind that weighs my hair down.  I am truly amazed by this product!  I only wish I could buy it by the gallon!</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have stated, this made my hair incredibly dry. I went to the salon for a haircut and my stylist was astonished at how dry and straw-like my hair had become after using this conditioner for a week. I am not sure why some seem to have great results with this conditioner and others, like me, have terrible results. Perhaps it depends on hair type (mine is baby fine and naturally wavy/curly), or water source. I live in Kentucky where the water contains a lot of calcium. Wish it had worked for me like some of the rave reviews I read before purchasing. I would suggest trying to get a sample of this product to test on your hair before purchasing a whole bottle.</li>
            <li> While this might work for some, I personally did not like this conditioner. I thought it left my hair very tangled and matted. I have relaxed hair and I like my regular Garnier.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair soft. Vanilla smell.</li>
            <li> I use it weekly and I&#x27;ve noticed that my hear maintains better elasticity and looks shinier. I&#x27;ve already ordered by second bottle. Love it!</li>
            <li> I have very dry and thin bleached hair, when i&#x27;m washing my hair with silk18 conditioner and argan oil shampoo at first it doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s doing anything to my hair like that silky feeling, but when it dries it feels so soft and looks shiny.The silk18 conditioner smells so good like coconut.The argan shampoo really smells like nothing which is ok.The reason why i gave it 4 stars is because it&#x27;s pretty expensive for such a small amount and i don&#x27;t have long hair and it still goes fast.If only you could get alittle more.Oh well it still beats pantene pro-v any day:)</li>
            <li> I have used one bottle of Silk 18 and have ordered another, primarily because I like that it is comprised of more of the natural ingredients than the typical hair product. However, I am not certain I like it better than Maple Holistics&#x27; other similar Argan conditioner. Silk 18 has a pleasant vanilla-like smell, whereas the Argan conditioner does not. But the Argan conditioner seemed to leave my hair feeling conditioned without adding a leave-in conditioner afterward. For some reason the Silk 18 did not do the same for me, but maybe I need to throw in a clarifying shampoo every once in a while. Not sure. The difference doesn&#x27;t really make sense as both projects list all the same ingredients and in the same order, with the one additional ingredient of &amp;#34;natural vanilla fragrance&amp;#34; added to the Silk 18. I have used both conditioners with the Argan shampoo by Maple Holistics, and have reordered all three products again so I can decide what seems to work better after using them a bit longer.</li>
            <li> It felt like magic in my hair. Absolutely love it so far, bought 4 more bottles. Could not be happier with it.  Update: my hair loves it. So far I&#x27;ve bought over 10 bottles. I can no longer detangle without it. It allows for you dangle so much easier. It leaves my coarse hair feeling so soft. I absolutely hate having to detangle without.   Con: doesn&#x27;t come in a bigger bottle and I have to use more than suggested during a conditioning session.</li>
            <li> I have very dry thin hair. This product seems to do what it advertises. Only been using for a short time so &amp;#34;time will tell.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> omggg this made my hair super soft and i have the type of hair that gets so rough n dry after washing but this has helped tremendously just woow!!!! BEST CONDITIONER EVEERRRR. will be buying over and over again till i stock up! a 4c&#x27;s hair best friend &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> The BEST conditioner ever . I am in love . It changed my hair . My hair looks beautiful .. Thank you . Maple holistics</li>
            <li> I have had snarly, fine hair for my entire life and can vividly recall crying and protesting, throughout my early childhood, while my mother tried to brush through my hair.  Rip, rip, rip!  Awful.  Even in my adult life, I have always had to rip my way through my hair, just to brush it out, with just two exceptions: (1) I can use a cider vinegar rinse (part of the no-&#x27;poo method), or (2) I can use Maple Holistics Silk 18 conditioner (yay!).  I had resigned myself to the no-&#x27;poo method, which was removing my blonde highlights, but when I recently returned to Florida and had to go back to using the horrible chlorine/chloramine-treated water here, no-&#x27;poo just wasn&#x27;t working any more... and my scalp was irritated and itchy, to boot.  I am a total canary and react to just about any chemical anything you can think of (with itching, rashes, acne: not fun), so I am always leery of trying new products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try Maple Holistics, based on all the positive reviews here, and am SO HAPPY I did!  The difference in my hair texture and comb-ability is amazing!!  Even with the terrible water here, I can brush right through my hair without any ripping, so I don&#x27;t end up with a brush full of hair. when I am finished.  Also, my scalp and nearby skin (neck, face, and upper back) are happy: no more itching or breakouts.  Love this stuff and am definitely going to try one of their shampoos next.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have sensitive skin (and/or scalp) and fine, snarly hair that is terrible to brush out, I highly recommend you try this stuff.  FABULOUS!</li>
            <li> My hair became soft &amp; shiny after using this conditioner. I would recommend this to my friend.</li>
            <li> Love this product .It makes my hair very silky ..and really nice smell.I will continue to use this conditioner.Thank you for an awesome product!</li>
            <li> Really like this product, it seems to condition my split ends. I LOVE the smell too:) Fast shipping also a plus!! The only reason I did not give it a 5 star is because I have not tried it that long and want to make sure it keeps my dry split ends moisturized.</li>
            <li> I had major dry scalp problems when I moved to a dry climate. It got so bad that I started experiencing hair loss. I tried every shampoo imaginable, but nothing improved the flaking of my scalp. I have very short hair so I never though of using a conditioner, but thankfully I came across this product and decided to give it a try and the improvement was very noticeable within a few days. I am almost completely flake free now, and my red, dry scalp has returned to normal. It also has a very pleasant vanilla smell.</li>
            <li> I am allergic to most conditioners, this brand has been a savior to my hair and this formula is amazing.  It reminds me of the conditioner that comes with hair dye box sets, super silky and potent, does everything I could have hoped for, and no break out!</li>
            <li> This product works wonders. Both my husband and I use it so it doesn&#x27;t smell perfumey. It has a very light pleasant scent. My hair is curly and past my waist and this tames it beautifully. I like to shower before bed, use this conditioner and then sleep with my hair in a bun. When I take it down in the morning it looks like I took time to curl my hair. I get asked all the time how long it took to style my hair. :) Plus it makes my hair and my husbands hair super soft and it looks healthy...never greasy. Even on my husbands short hair. We always try to stick with natural products so happy that this one does such a good job at a good price. I ordered two bottles in advance the last time I was running low...didn&#x27;t want to take any chances of running out! Ok and last very important detail...the company is awesome. I&#x27;ve never had a bad encounter with customer service. We got their Teatree shampoo (also a great product) and it busted in the mail. They happily replaced the product no hassle. It&#x27;s hard to find customer service like that. I bet if you emailed them with your hair problems they would happily tell you which products would work best for you. A friendly company goes a long way in my book. This product/company has a lot going for them. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> My hair is color treated and recently I have highlights to mix with my silver strands. Even though I eat clean, use organic hair products my hair has been very dry. Got Silk conditioner and Argan oil Shampoo a week ago, and so far I&#x27;ve used both in combination 3 times. Seems like my hair feels little softer. Will update in 1 month.</li>
            <li> I was surfing the internet for something to use on severely dry/damaged hair and came across this product.  I had never heard of it before, but I liked that it was all natural.  After doing some research on other recommended products, I decided to try this one since it was on sale and had awesome reviews.  I&#x27;m so glad I did!  I love it!  I have had my wavy caucasian hair in dreads, which were combed out a year or so ago, then white-blonde bleached and now dyed bright purple, so my hair has seriously seen some things.  My ends are frazzled and dry, but I really didn&#x27;t want to cut my hair.This conditioner instantly makes my stressed out hair relax and smooth down.  Seriously, it sounds cheesy, but when I put it on, I feel my hair kind of relax and breathe a sigh of relief.  haha.  I have really long hair, and it just takes a little bit to do the full length.  I love the smell, too.  When my hair is feeling extra dry, I just put a squirt of this on the ends and they feel much softer.  I really like that it doesn&#x27;t fade my color out or feel like it&#x27;s weighing it down, either.  I&#x27;d definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> The conditioner smells great, and really softens my hair. I have medium length hair, so I kind of have to use a lot for it to feel fully conditioned. Other than that, this is a great product and would recommend.</li>
            <li> I bought this conditioner to replace my drugstore brand &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; conditioner because it had not been working that great the past couple weeks and I wanted a change.  The drug store conditioner made my hair feel soft, but look frizzy and undefined.  Silk 18 is more expensive (especially considering how much conditioner I use), but I&#x27;m a sucker for natural products and the reviews made it seem promising.  My usual hair routine (for my long, course, curly/wavy hair) is to wash w/ diluted Dr Bronner&#x27;s soap, apply conditioner and rinse, and then use some of the same conditioner as a leave-in when I get out of the shower, and let my hair air dry.  Silk 18 made my hair shiny, and it helped the curls clump better than the other brand I was using, but it also made my hair kinda stiff and crunchy.  I used it a couple times, with no improvement on the stiffness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since Silk 18 made my curls defined and shiny, but not soft, and the Tresemme made my hair soft but undefined and not particularly shiny, I decided to combine the two.  I used the Tresemme in the shower, and Silk 18 as a leave-in afterwards.  I really liked the result, my hair looked better than when I used either of them by themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I did not find Silk 18 to be a good conditioner, hence the 3 stars.  It is, however, a good leave-in or curl cream type product for my hair.  I would consider buying it again for this purpose, but it will depend on how long I can get the bottle to last cause it is a little expensive for my non-existant beauty budget.</li>
            <li> This stuff is so amazing, it&#x27;s a small bottle but it lasts a while and it makes your hair smell so good and feel so soft! &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Cant say how much i love this product. I have very frizzy long hair and live in a very humid Australian climate. I could tell right away, my hair was lovely and smooth with just a quick blow dry.</li>
            <li> This made my hair feel good, but it&#x27;s not a miracle worker. For the price I really don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth it. But it is a nice conditioner, just nothing special.</li>
            <li> This product will be the only conditioner I will use from now on.It makes my dry brittle hair feel so silky and soft. The smell is heavenly. You really should try this product.</li>
            <li> I am switching over to an all natural hair/face product line. After reading dozens of reviews I stumbled upon Silk 18. Price seemed reasonable, especially with the sale that is going on. I received it quick, thanks to Amazon Prime, but was a bit disappointed in the small bottle thinking &amp;#34;11 bucks for this?!&amp;#34; Until I used it that is.... I cannot stop smelling my hair!!!It is a subtle hint of vanilla that does not fade throughout the day. The conditioner itself...AMAZING!!! I rarely stick to one product, but this is a must!!! I went right back on amazon and ordered 3 more bottles in fear that the sale will be ending soon.</li>
            <li> It is a great conditioner, but a little heavy for my fine, curly hair.  I have been using it as a deep conditioner that I use about once every other week.</li>
            <li> OMGOSH, I have found my perfect conditioner for my 4b/c hair.  As some know, our hair type gets really dry,really quickly, but this conditioner has given me hope.  I have always been sceptical about products that say they moisturize, mostly because I never found one that did even half the job it says it would.  I could feel the product working as I massaged it into my hair and scalp.  I left it in for about 10 -15 minutes while helping my son study, so I thought the softness would rinse out, and the dream would be over, nope.  I was still in my happy place.  My hair was still soft, even after 10 minutes of t-shirt drying.  I have found my conditioner.  I feel like the natural women on those youtube videos that rave about a conditioner they just tried while they&#x27;re rubbing there hair in the mirror. I&#x27;ll try it on my 4yr. old, almost sure it&#x27;ll have the same effect.  I&#x27;m in Love.</li>
            <li> I really love this conditioner! I had a several dry hair when I moved to California two months ago, dehydrate, hair scalp, hair loss and itchy. And I had tried four different brands of shampoo and conditioner before, but none of them worked out, neither cause serious hair loss or make it greasy and oily... Then I bought this one. It just says what the name tell you, making the hair as the silk. And I highly recommend this to you if you have similar problem.</li>
            <li> 5 stars on Amazon&#x3D;love. AND I seriously LOVE his product. It smells aaaa-mazing and is also a great conditioner for very dry, curly hair. I have only used a few times so far as I just received but my hair felt softer/smoother immediately. Already plotting my next order because my hair could benefit from drinking this stuff daily. BEST OF all--it&#x27;s all NATURAL, paraben free. I&#x27;ll write again as I see effect on my hair over time.</li>
            <li> I tried this on a whim after reading so many reviews. their website will send you a free sample to try first, I only buy high end hair products so I had serious doubts because of the lower price,i never buy at a drugstore I figured it must be like loreal excellence stuff... but for free sure ill try it why not. I have medium length fine wavy frizzy color treated  hair, get a keratin treatment a couple times a year. in fact im going for one today and I feel like I might be wasting money after trying this product. it really reduced frizz, still have great body, got a comb thru it like silk no breakage which never happens. the smell is fine, vanilla ,not my favorite but not strong at all only could smell it in shower not after my hair was done.  I actually didn&#x27;t even have to flat iron after using this conditioner. im sure once I keratin, this conditioner, will even be more amazing. im sold even without a keratin so I cant imagine with one. I just ordered two bottles and also ordered  the argan oil shampoo, not even going to bother with a sample that&#x27;s how confidant I am that I will love it. don&#x27;t hesitate get your free sample.</li>
            <li> I purchased both the silk 18 conditioner and the aragon shampoo.  I have long fine color treated hair with lots of flyaways:( After using the shampoo and conditioner together I noticed my hair was very silky and seemed to have less frizz.  Prior to this I was spending a grip of money on pureology.  I am pleased with the instant difference this shampoo and conditioner made. I definitely recommend you give it a try.  It is well worth the price!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product, I have long thick hair and this actually does the job. I am very naturalistic and enjoy that it is such a heathy way to condition my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may not leave your hair all silky, like the products with silicone in it, but once your hair dries, the softness is unreal!</li>
            <li> This conditioner smells amazing and leaves hair soft and shiny. I have switched over to using only natural products. This is one of the best natural conditioners I have tried.</li>
            <li> I have spent years trying dozens of &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; conditioners.  My hair is thick, wirey, and wavy.  If I brush it, it frizzes out and looks like crap.  I have been using this Silk 18 conditioner now for 3 weeks.  And from the very first use, my hair has felt softer, less frizzy and 100% more manageable than with any other natural hair care product I&#x27;ve tried.  I also have found that with my thickness, conditioner can be very expensive because I essentially have to use an entire handful in order to fully coat my thick hair.  However, with the Silk 18 conditioner, I can get away with only using about 1/8th the amount I would otherwise.  I would recommend this product and will continue to use it for many years to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note, it is kind of hard to squeeze out of the bottle unless you have it stored upside down &amp; you have to shake/pat it.  And it has a smokey fragrance to it.  Neither of these are deal breakers for me, I&#x27;m a committed consumer of this conditioner for life, it works perfect for my hair.</li>
            <li> I really love this conditioner. It leaves even my combination Brillo/Buffalo hair soft and very well moisturized. The ingredients in all these products are very good essential oils-you can tell they make a difference.</li>
            <li> Every time I use this I think it smells like root beer and to me, that is ok - it is a delicious smell. Works really well too.</li>
            <li> I tried silk conditioner and fell in love. It makes you hair smell really good and tangle free.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best conditioner I have ever used and I&#x27;ve tried a LOT of conditioners. It smells amazing, though subtle, and makes my aging hair soft, silky and shinier than it&#x27;s been in a decade.&lt;br /&gt;I am nearing 60 with bra strap length, super fine hair which tangles very easily. Though it&#x27;s not damaged (no coloring or perms here) it&#x27;s nearly impossible to get a comb through wet, it and it&#x27;s been falling out and breaking daily. In desperation I&#x27;ve switched to no sulfate/silicone free shampoos and conditioners and have even resorted to making my own. After using this for the first time last night, the comb glided right through it and there were very few hairs in my brush after when brushing after it dried. What&#x27;s not to love?&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use this conditioner, and came back to buy a bottle for my daughter whose hair is very wavy, long, tangles easily and is damaged from years of coloring. Can&#x27;t wait for her to try it! I also plan to try their shampoos....it&#x27;s great to find a natural line without all the nasties that actually delivers. Thank you for an awesome product!</li>
            <li> I really like the feel of my hair with this conditioner.  It is not too heavy, leaving your hair easy to style.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing conditioner! my wife has thick hair that usually looks like she is a lion...but this made it silk and smooth. I use it sometimes as well. Very good product, def recommend.</li>
            <li> My wife says:    I have been switching all my products from \\&quot;regular\\&quot; ones to ones that are more natural and don&#x27;t contain all the nasty chemicals.  It has been a long process and I have come across some good and some not so good products.  I have tried several conditioners and this one is the best by far (even when compared to the so-called regular ones).    The conditioner is nice and thick meaning the product is not watered down.  Best of all is how my hair feels - soft, smooth and hydrated.  I have long hair and it helps with detangling and it does not weigh my hair down.  Try this product and you won&#x27; regret it - it will leave your hair the silkiest it&#x27;s ever been!    The only downside (if I had to say) would be that I wish it came in a bulk size to make it less costly.</li>
            <li> I would buy this again at the sale price. I loved the smell and the way my curly hair detangles after conditioning. I am always on the look out for more natural products, and this is a keeper.</li>
            <li> Great scent; very natural, light and pleasant. Texture is very silky and easy to apply, don&#x27;t need to use a ton; which, with my hair being coarse and curly, I tend to blow through conditioner rapidly. I like that this is natural and my hair likes that it contains no sulfates. Would love to try it in combination with a matching shampoo or conditioning cleanser to get the full effect.</li>
            <li> The conditioner is awesome, it worked a lot faster than I thought it would. I usually don&#x27;t get dry skin/scalp, but for some reason this winter has been killing me so far. The shampoo and conditioner I got from you guys healed my scalp in about 2 or 3 washes and I like that the smell of each is a light citrus/vanilla ish sent.</li>
            <li> This review is for this conditioner and the Sage shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I have thick hair and sebaceous dermatitis.  My scalp gets an extra layer of skin and dandruff.  I&#x27;m older, and my hair is so dry I wash my hair only once a week, even with my scalp condition.  I&#x27;ve used Head &amp; Shoulders and it helps but is drying.  I tried tea tree shampoo and that makes my scalp tingle and feel clean but its scent is too strong.  So I tried this shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  The shampoo doesn&#x27;t tingle, still my scalp and hair is very clean.  Its scent is barely there, not too strong.  It lathers up so well I don&#x27;t use as much as with other shampoos, very efficient.  I was concerned though, because after rinsing out the shampoo, my hair felt too dry.  Then I used the conditioner and wow it felt thick and smooth, even the ends.  Instead of feeling brittle, I&#x27;m enjoying how my hair feels soft, bouncy and healthy, even my old hair :)  The shampoo and conditioner work well together.  After a week, my scalp is still clean and my hair is soft and not fly-away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Because the shampoo seems to strip the hair clean, I recommend using the conditioner also.  They&#x27;re definitely a team.  I&#x27;m loving it.</li>
            <li> I use this with the Tea Tree Shampoo for moderate dandruff with argan and jojoba offered by Maple holistics, and my hair feels very clean and soft ... and dandruff free.</li>
            <li> I wanted to see if this could work on my hair which is fine, thin and color treated.  I have very light hair and was concerned this could weight it down or leave it oily but it did neither, quit the opposite in fact!  I washed with my regular shampoo then applied Silk 18, put a palm full of water on my hair to help \\&quot;move\\&quot; the product throughout my hair, covering every strand.  I left this on for about 10 minutes in the shower and then rinsed.  I also let my hair air dry after, with no additional products.  The scent was light and pleasant during use and fades to a hint when hair dries.  This left my hair very soft with less frizz, and more shine, absolutely no oil or weight traces. I believe my hair felt healthier.  I would recommend this on all hair types and I am excited to try more of their products.</li>
            <li> My friend, knowing how much I love all-natural conditioners, bought this for my birthday. At first, I was a little skeptical; I&#x27;ve never heard of Maple Holistics before. But, I must say, it was perfect; it left my hair smooth and less frizzy. It made de-tangling my hair pretty easy too. I&#x27;m very impressed.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this conditioner and love how it leaves my hair feeling smooth and silky.  Having thin hair, I often struggle with finding a conditioner that does not weigh my hair down, and this one washes out clean and my hair feels light afterward.</li>
            <li> This product works wonders! My hair has never felt softer!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine if you use a shampoo that&#x27;s rich.</li>
            <li> At first I tried this conditioner and I found it to be pretty good, but not necessarily a keeper. Then as I ran out of the conditioner, I thought, &amp;#34;What shampoo and conditioner should I try next?&amp;#34; I considered switching brands completely, but knowing that Silk 18 is made with natural ingredients, I went back to the Amazon page to figure out what I was doing wrong. After reading reviews about people who have used this product as a deep conditioner, I decided to try leaving it in my hair longer, and the results were great! Finally I noticed a true difference that isn&#x27;t seeming to go away with each use as is the case with other shampoos and conditioners. Not to mention, the scent of this stuff is awesome.</li>
            <li> This is really a wonderful conditioner. Makes my hair super shiny and soft. The shine is very noticeable. It also has helped with frizziness and had made my hair overall much smoother. The effect is similar to applying silicones in your hair, but this is natural. Also, I have to say that the vanilla scent is really wonderful. My husband notices it and really loves it (he says it smells like a vanilla cookie). The smell lingers for a day or two, so even if I don&#x27;t wash my hair everyday, my hair still smells good! This has never happened before with other products... Usually my hair starts smelling unfresh after a few hours. I really love this conditioner. I just bought the shampoo too.</li>
            <li> The conditioner is unlike any I have ever used. The strength of my hair improved 100% after being battered by over bleaching.</li>
            <li> Perfect conditioner for my biracial daughters.  Their hair is easier to comb through and I use a bit of it mixed with water in a spray bottle for morning bed-hair.  Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner! It leave my hair silky but not weighted down or greasy feeling. I love that it&#x27;s sulfate free.</li>
            <li> LOVE the smell! I use it with the shampoo and overall my hair seems more moisturized. I love knowing it&#x27;s organic and better for my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair felt very soft after the first use and the vanilla scent was lasting! I recommend this product for anyone with dry hair or who simply wants a natural product that creates a soft texture.  I&#x27;ve used this product for 6 months now and will continue purchasing!</li>
            <li> Love it! My hair is so soft now and has less breakage. You also barely need to use any for your hair to be soft!</li>
            <li> I think this works wonderfully. I like the way my hair feels after using it only one time! I&#x27;m happy with this product!</li>
            <li> I have found my new go to conditioner for my thick natural hair!  Ok I have the kind of hair that soaks up moisture and product like a WET VAC!  Silk 18 has actually managed to give my hair the BUSINESS by making my hair retain a soft moisturized feel for now 6 days.  I did a simple blow out after washing and using the product and I have used no other products on my hair as I wanted to see what the raves are all about!  I am highly endorsing this products to all my natural and non-natural friends.  I even started a FB page where I endorsed it as well.  I say go get it you won&#x27;t be disappointed!  I can&#x27;t wait to try some of their other products!</li>
            <li> I have recently purchased this conditioner based on the reviews - being skeptical I wasn&#x27;t so sure if it would be effective or not, this is my second time using it and i have to say I love it, my hair is soft, frizz free even the ends are manageable- the smell is also refreshing with vanilla undertone. Overall I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have been using this conditioner for about 3 weeks. It&#x27;s not very thick but it&#x27;s enough to keep my hair smooth. My hair is curly but thin and needs a lot of TLC. I like the scent. My husband has been using it as well and he likes it. Great product and the price is reasonable. Ingredients are pretty good. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I bought the shampoo and despite reading that if you have oily hair you should not condition I am glad that I decided to get the conditioner anyway.  The shampoo definitely took the oily appearance out of my hair and I applied this stuff only to the tips of my hair and not my scalp, it left my hair soft and now I don&#x27;t have to worry about my hair drying out or producing excess oil because it&#x27;s dried out.</li>
            <li> Wow, what a difference.  I was using normal conditioners before this and after just one use I could feel and see a difference in the softness and shininess of my hair.  It gives my hair a light silky feel after washing it and a nice woody vanilla smell that smells yummy and not overpowering.  I tossed my other conditioner and am officially switching to this!</li>
            <li> Love the smell and makes my thins hair feel thicker and soft.</li>
            <li> I hardly ever write reviews. My hair can be dry as I highlight it. Although my hair used to have a silky, lustrous  consistency, it has grown frizzy on the top  sections of late. I bought this product after trying several other conditioning products that hardly made a difference. I am pleased to note that my hair has returned to its silky state and looks beautiful and much healthier. I am really happy with silk 18. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Love it!!! Works great. Keeps my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> Loved this conditioner, made my hair very soft and calmed my frizzy end. However I didn&#x27;t particularly care for the smell. The product as a whole was definitely a good purchase.</li>
            <li> I never really strayed away from my usual &amp;#34;drugstore&amp;#34; brand conditioner until a friend gave me this for Christmas. She swore by it and insisted that I try it! It smells amazing! The first time I used it I left it on my hair for about 10 mins and did my usual routine. After rinsing, I noticed an immediate difference in the feeling of my hair! After styling as usual, I was amazed by how silky, shiny, and soft my hair was! This stuff is awesome and I would recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> I used this conditioner and LOVE IT!!! I have very frizzy damaged hair and I could tell it was helping from the first use</li>
            <li> This works great!!! I&#x27;ve searched high and low for a conditioner that doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy looking and feeling after washing with it. This is the one!!! It even smells wonderful. Definitely worth the extra cost for the result.  Thanks so much for making a natural conditioner that actually works!!!</li>
            <li> This conditioner was given to me as a gift. I really enjoyed the smell and how it took out all the tangles out of my hair. My hair looks more alive and less dull. I will be trying the shampoo next because I am happy with this product!</li>
            <li> Love this product!!!!!</li>
            <li> Great product. I have thick hair and this helps me comb through it. I like that its a decent price.</li>
            <li> I started using the Silk 18 conditioner a few days ago along with the Argan shampoo.  I have dry/frizzy blonde hair and these products so far have made my hair noticeably softer and smoother.  I almost always use natural/organic hair products, but this is the first time I&#x27;ve actually been able to notice a difference in how my hair feels.  I&#x27;m hoping that with continued use it will also help with my frizziness!  So far so good!  Just wish it came in a larger bottle.</li>
            <li> I love the rich vanilla scent of this conditioner, and my dry, frizzy hair is much more soft, manageable and looks great and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been battling my dry curly hair for decades and this is the first product I&#x27;ve found that genuinely makes a difference, it&#x27;s fantastic.  It leaves my hair feeling soft and the curls in nice frizz-free ringlets.  You only need a little and it practically eliminates the need for other products.  Way to go Maple Holistics!</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner. It does a wonderful job of keeping hair soft as it dries. It also works well as a leave-in conditioner.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the price scare you away! A little bit goes a long way. My hair has never felt so silky soft before! It is much more healthy, voluminous, and light. I am very pleased with my Maple Holistics purchase and will be a life-long customer!</li>
            <li> This stuff smells realllly good and feels nice on my head. I&#x27;ve been losing hair for a few years now so I try to stay away from the normal sulfate shampoos and instead use these kinds with natural oils and ingredients. I actually really like this stuff and would buy again</li>
            <li> This is my holy-grail conditioner! I have dry damaged hair due to coloring my hair for many years. I have tried so many conditioners and although they may have temporarily conditioned my hair, in the long run they were doing nothing for my hair.  After a few uses of this natural conditioner I noticed a significance difference in texture and feel of my hair. Hair that I hadn&#x27;t felt since nearly fifteen years. I cannot rave enough about this sulfate-free conditioner, because while it conditions well, it doesn&#x27;t strip my hair of its color. I love it, and think you should try it!</li>
            <li> I bought this conditioner along with the argan shampoo (which sadly didn&#x27;t work for me) and it&#x27;s great! Just a little bit leaves my hair soft and smooth, and the scent is fantastic.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful conditioner. It smells very nice and has a light, sweet scent. The ingredients are great and it has a nice rich, creamy consistency that&#x27;s very easy to apply to my curly hair. It leaves my hair smelling, looking and feeling great. It moisturizes and softens my curls and  adds much needed shine. It really does give hair a silkiness. I&#x27;ve tried so many conditioners and this one is near the top. I would recommend this to anyone with any hair type. It&#x27;s not heavy and it&#x27;s not too light, it washes off smoothly and easily.</li>
            <li> Good product for the price. It leaves my hair soft and silky just like it said it would. I&#x27;ve used other deep conditioners and this product is somewhere in the middle for quality. Not the best but not the worst.</li>
            <li> within days I noticed a difference in my curly hair;  it feels soft and I love the vanilla scent. the only drawback was the amount of conditioner, but it&#x27;s worth it&#x27;s price.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE! I&#x27;ll start off saying I was surprised at the size of the bottle - I thought it would be a bit larger for the money paid. However, this bottle will last me a loooong time. Many conditioners say use a quarter size amount - this means it. It is plenty for my hair (about 2 inches below shoulders). The smell is pleasant and the formula is creamy. It leaves my hair feeling silky, yet it still feels clean. There is no left over residue. I bought this and the Argan Oil Shampoo at the same time. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the combo of these two but I have noticed a visible difference in the texture and feel of my hair.</li>
            <li> I love that this is an all natural product and it smells like vanilla so good.  My hair was soft and tangle free. I would recommend this conditioner.</li>
            <li> I bought the shampoo with this.&lt;br /&gt;This conditioner made my hair sooo soft&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But guys, it&#x27;s not a miracle. It doesn&#x27;t make your hair straight or anything.  It makes it soft which in turn makes it manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I figure if you switch between this conditioners every so often, with this, then your hair will continue to be soft. (As hair can get used to products)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE SMELL: natural vanilla. It really isn&#x27;t bad. It reminds me of that vegan store called Lush (naturally hand made products for skin, hair, etc.)</li>
            <li> I have really enjoyed my first purchase of Silk 18 conditioner, in conjunction  with the Maple Holistics Argan Oil Shampoo. I have thin hair, and I recently went through a six month hair loss cycle.  Now that it has stopped shedding, I got it cut in a shoulder length bob style.  My hair shaft has always been thin, but I used to have a lot of it. Now, it&#x27;s thin and thin:(. But it&#x27;s rebounding, and when I use this combination it leaves my hair clean, but not stripped, shiny, and I can even go a day without washing!  That&#x27;s truly amazing for me!  I don&#x27;t have to use much to style my hair with these products. They leave it in such good shape. I&#x27;m really happy to have found this company!</li>
            <li> Fantastic conditioner!  I was looking for something that would be good on my color treated hair and add moisture.  This product sure did the trick!</li>
            <li> Best conditioner I have ever used. Leaves hair so soft and it smells amazing. Pricey for an 8z bottle but worth every penny</li>
            <li> Helps to make hair softer and works on a dry scalp.</li>
            <li> I think this is a good conditioner. Not to heavy and has a light vanilla scent. I look forward to trying other shampoos and conditioners from Maple Holistics.</li>
            <li> LOVE, love LoVe this conditioner!  When I opened the bottle, a little got on my fingertips.  I rubbed it into my skin and knew this would be amazing for my scalp and hair.  It&#x27;s moisturizing and non-greasy and smells wonderful!  Many conditioners tend to weigh my fine hair down, not this one.  I am really pleased and will order again.</li>
            <li> It was about as good as most conditioners from the drug store.</li>
            <li> 1. This stuff smells amazing! 2. I feel good that it&#x27;s all natural. 3. Not quite as thick as I&#x27;d like it to be,  since I have dry curly hair, but it&#x27;s alright.</li>
            <li> It is an excellent product . Let your hair shining and makes it look very healthy......</li>
            <li> I have been using this conditioner along with the argan shampoo for about 6 weeks now. My hair is nearly waist length, slightly wavy and fine so it is very noticeable if I use a product that weighs down my hair. This conditioner seems to have the perfect combination of enough moisturizing without adding weight.  My hair is noticeably shiny. My hair fall is less than half what it was 6 weeks ago. I had started developing a static problem that prompted me to change shampoo and conditioner to this brand and that is entirely eliminated.  I  really enjoy the natural vanilla scent as well; I wish they would add it to the shampoo.</li>
            <li> Last January when I first stumbled across this product, I was very skeptical due to all the great reviews but decided to go ahead and give this conditioner a try. Boy, was I surprised! It seemed to be the &amp;#34;where has this been all my life?!&amp;#34; type of product. It tamed the worst of my frizz, made my hair oh-so-soft, and completely detangled my hair. It smelled of vanilla, but was not too strong for my liking. I shower 4 times a week, and this bottle lasted me 2 months (I don&#x27;t see how some of the other people reviewing it could go through the whole bottle in just 1 week). Seemed like the perfect product ... until I noticed something unsettling.  My hair started shedding like it had when I used to use store-bought conditioners (not clumps or anything, but fairly significant). I was using another new product at the time (a shampoo), so I wasn&#x27;t sure which was causing the problem. Well, I ran out of the conditioner before I ran out of shampoo and, without thinking about it, I re-ordered this conditioner. During the time that I waiting for it to arrive and not using any conditioner, the shedding stopped -- completely. The conditioner arrived today, and since I needed a shower, I used it -- and my hair proceeded to shed again. So, something is definitely wrong. Either there is something in this conditioner that shouldn&#x27;t be in it, or I am personally sensitive to one of the natural ingredients. I really wish I could give this 5 stars -- I loved it for so many reasons (which is why I&#x27;m not giving it 3 stars)! But I can&#x27;t give it 5, and I can&#x27;t keep using something that makes my hair shed. :-( So, I will also not purchase it again. And I will be looking for something else to condition my hair with. Sigh. The hunt continues.</li>
            <li> Really enjoyed this product.  Leaves your hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li> This works very well.  My hair was like straw before and after one use it feel much softer.</li>
            <li> For the past year, it has been trial and error process for me as I tried all natural hair products... Until now! This is a really quality products that smells good, nourishes the hair very well, and isn&#x27;t full of any nasty and potentially harmful chemicals. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m all natural and have been for 2 1/2 years. I&#x27;ve tried various products and this has been consistent perfection. A lot of times I do an avocado, olive oil and egg mask . The egg fried out my hair but this conditioner allows me to run my fingers through my hair with ease. Get restorer and allows me to detangle with ease! Smells great too!</li>
            <li> This made my hair very soft and smells nice. Love that its natural and still does the job!  I wish it came in a bigger bottle.</li>
            <li> I just received this product yesterday, it arrived in one day! I bought this to use in conjunction with Argan shampoo. I used both products last night for the first time, and I really liked them. I read a lot of reviews of having to lather twice on the shampoo, I definitely did not! Maybe because I&#x27;ve been using natural shampoo for months now. My hair is highlighted or as I like to call it, &amp;#34;fried&amp;#34;. After the first shampoo and conditioning treatment I see a difference. My hair feels softer. I&#x27;m not kidding, I keep touching it because I can&#x27;t believe it myself. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the shampoo or the conditioner, but I love it! I will continue to use them both. The conditioner does have a great vanilla scent. I washed it last night and stopped smelling it this morning. That was 15 hours of light vanilla scented hair.</li>
            <li> Good product. Smells like vanilla, but not overpowering. Not a heavy conditioner so you can use it every day... But it does not leave my wife&#x27;s hair silky at all.</li>
            <li> My daughter introduced me to this product.  Her hair was very dry and frizzy.  Her first application she was so excited she  immediately gave me the  conditioner, Silk 18 for me to try.  My hair is very dry and this product made it very shinny and soft without weighing it down.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was fast, and I appreciate the company emailing me to see if I like their product.&lt;br /&gt;Very good customer service.  Thank You.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this conditioner.  I originally bought the Argan Shampoo without the conditioner and found it to be very drying and static inducing.  I went back to Amazon and purchased this and it worked great.  No more static or dry hair and my hair is silky smooth.  BTW, the conditioner I had at home did nothing for the static/drying from the Argan Shampoo.  The biggest thing is it is not oily at all.  I do not do well with moisture shampoos or conditioners as my hair will get heavy, flat and oily by the end of the day.  I was worried this would be too much moisture for me but its not at all.  When I have more time in the morning I will actually apply this conditioner and wrap my hair up so I can leave it in for about 30 minutes.  A lot of other reviewer raved about doing this so I gave it a shot.  My hair was so silky smooth I was amazed.  My other conditioners do not compare to this one at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW - Maple Holistics offered to refund my money for the Argan Shampoo and send me a new bottle of their new and improved Argan Shampoo since I was not completely satisfied with it.  They have excellent customer service.  If nothing else I would say to try these products worry free as they are true to their word and will refund your money if you are not satisfied.</li>
            <li> Amazing product! This is the only conditioner that makes my childrens tangles fall out with little brushing effort. It leaves their hair extremely soft and manageable. I highly recommend this product to anyone who deals with tangles. The smell is wonderful too.</li>
            <li> The smell is awesome and it leaves my hair so smooth. After I bleached my hair couple times, my hair start hating me and became pretty dry. I have only used silk 18 for few times and it gives my hair a smooth finish. When I get hair products, I always go for smells beside functions, this vanilla scent is very lovely. I have short hair and I can still able to smell the yumminess after hours I washed my hair. I would totally buy it again!!</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite Conditioner!  I believe it has worked well with a vitamin shampoo to really strengthen my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROs:&lt;br /&gt;-- Sulfate free&lt;br /&gt;-- Full of potent ingredients for hair health like Silk Amino Acids, Argan, Jojoba, and Keratin&lt;br /&gt;-- While conditioning you smell a nice really mellow vanilla fragrance, and after rinse-out, no fragrance lingers&lt;br /&gt;-- Easily de-tangles my always tangling hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONs:&lt;br /&gt;-- None&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This conditioner partners very well with &amp;#34;VITAMINS Hair Loss Shampoo&amp;#34;  (also at Amazon) with Biotin, Coconut Oil, and Procapil to do an amazing job of getting the hair healthy enough to eliminate hair breakage and hair fall-out in about a month.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair that tends to get very dry, especially in the winter months.  I really liked this conditioner.  It creates a nice slip and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down or make it feel greasy.  I will purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Fantastic...I have ringlets.. not only do you see every single one..my hair looks healthy..I use it maybe twice a week.. the bottle is small, so I want to cherish every drop</li>
