    <ol>
            <li> Caps were open so bag was wet, lost some product. But still like the product</li>
            <li> My father-in-law is incontinent.  This pump works really well, and it gets him clean without rinsing.</li>
            <li> This makes a person with a disability we use this on feel very clean. We&#x27;ve been using it for years on him, and he and we highly recommend it. He also struggles with odor issues, and this really cuts the odor, especially under his armpits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know it says that you can rub it in or leave it on, but we use it with water in lieu of soap and it works better that way.</li>
            <li> Discovered this product as a result of a hospital stay. Is also good for facial cleansing. Leaves skin feeling clean and is very gentle.</li>
            <li> love it! So good! It is gentle and lasts very long. A bottle last me four months. Also it does not hurt my eyes when I use it. Definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> used  it for many years works well</li>
            <li> If you have a family member who needs bed baths, this is the best product ever. I like to wet a wash cloth with water, then spray this foam either on the cloth or the patient. It is so clean and fresh smelling. It is gentle on the skin and good for washing the entire body, even the hair. I highly recommend this product. One bottle will last about a month. I tried three different types, and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> works great when you are not near water</li>
            <li> good for waterless bath.</li>
            <li> So nice to have to washing hair especially - first introduced to this product in the hospital and we like it very well</li>
            <li> The Aloe Vesta Cleansing Foam worked as promised.  The product was very effective in keeping my wife clean and free from rash while keeping her skin moist and soft.</li>
            <li> This is the best cleansing foam for handicapped people who are unable to get into the shower.  Good for hair as well. Wound nurses request that the patient get this to help in his or her healing.</li>
            <li> My wife had this product used on her while she was in the hospital by the nurses. It is very soothing and easy to use. After she&lt;br /&gt;returned home from the hospital, we started buying this for home use. Its quick and easy to use. A++++++++++++++ in my book.</li>
            <li> This is great for sensitive skin areas anywhere on your body. Cleans and moisturizes. No rinse needed.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.  Following surgery, where I could not shower for 2 weeks, I used this to clean off with.  It smells great, is no rinse, and I felt clean and refreshed each day.I was able to use it as shampoo as well</li>
            <li> A very good product. Dose all it says and has stopped problems mom was having.</li>
            <li> BICYCLE RIDERS BENEFIT ! -- I refresh my &#x27;bike helmet hair&#x27; making myself more presentable after a ride. This 8oz. refills a much smaller bottle received at a brief hospital stay. I keep this in my ride pack. I&#x27;m promptly neat after a brief hair rinse and a mild sweat-area wipe sometimes; thus renewing my day&#x27;s earlier shower. Associates generally don&#x27;t realize how I had pedaled to our meeting on my 2-wheeler. HIGHEST MARKS!</li>
            <li> It took far longer to receive this than I expected.  When I tried to use it, I realized it was taped closed with scotch tape.  I tried to open the bottle and nearly a fourth of the liquid was spilled.  This leaves me wondering what is in the bottle.  I have no idea if it is Aloe Vesta Cleansing Foam or some other product.  I used it yesterday and it seemed different to me than what I had used previously from another vendor.  The package was shipped in a Priority Mail paper envelope.  Perhaps if it were packaged better, no scotch tape would be needed.  I don&#x27;t recommend this from this vendor.  I will have the pharmacist order it for me at CVS.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Good as a shampoo also</li>
            <li> Great product!  Took it abroad for my mother to use while hospitalized.  It really works well, she says itis the best thing after a real shower, feels and smells Great, and does not leave her skin dry.</li>
            <li> BEST PRODUCT TO HAVE AT HOME OR TO TAKE ON YOUR VACTION, GOOD CLEAN AND REFRESHING, AND MOST IMPORTANT IS A WATER SAVER.</li>
            <li> does a very good cleaning job</li>
            <li> Given it&#x27;s usage purpose there is nothing better to relief pain and ensure cleansing.</li>
            <li> Great for general cleaning on a senior,</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my Aloe Vesta Foam.  I have very sensitive skin and react badly to most products.  However, I have been using this foam and find it not only cleansing but soothing as well.</li>
            <li> Best cleaning foam! I&#x27;ve used it for years and will continue as long as Amazon continues to carry it.</li>
            <li> Soooo happy we found this!  My 84  yr old mother fell and cannot wash her hair now.  It had been 3 weeks and we tried this.  A million stars!  Smells great like aloe.  We used damp wash cloth to wet her hair, foamed this on, used wet wash cloth to &amp;#34;rinse&amp;#34; and her self esteem popped back on!  No mess, easy, nice smell...perfect!</li>
            <li> Very gentle and does a thorough cleaning leaving a fresh scent. Really like that it can be used for body and hair.</li>
            <li> So convenient for bed bathing. Easy to use, no fuss, no mess</li>
            <li> Great product!! Easy to clean entire body, Including hair.</li>
            <li> Our Nursing Aids like this product for my aging Mother</li>
            <li> Used with a basin and washcloth, works well as a substitute while not able to shower. No residue.</li>
            <li> Works for those days when you are jumping thru hoops, have had earlier morning shower and need to freshen up later in the day.</li>
