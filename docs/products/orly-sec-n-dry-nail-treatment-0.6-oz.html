            <li>This top coat makes my at-home manicure last, so much longer.</li>

            <li>but it may have been an older bottle.</li>

            <li>Your manicure last so much longer.</li>
            <li>I used to sell professional nail products and was a rep for OPI.</li>
            <li>I use this with Orly Bonder as my base coat and  my manicure stays perfect for 5-7  days with no chipping.</li>
            <li>Typically, I have to wait for close to an hour after polishing to do much of anything at all with my hands.</li>

            <li> Typically, I have to wait for close to an hour after polishing to do much of anything at all with my hands.</li>
            <li> and I let my polish dry somewhat, because if I don&#x27;t, the colors will run when this product is applied.</li>
            <li> This product does dry in seconds.</li>
            <li> Every time I would paint my finger nails at home, they would chip by the end of the day, which is such a waste of time.</li>
            <li> I tried putting this on wet Orly polish, and it just smeared it.</li>
            <li> I had expected a thicker product.</li>
            <li> I mentioned this in my other review.</li>
            <li> I tried OPI and other drying products, but nothing comes close to this.</li>
            <li> If you need to polish your nails and be on the go in less than 30 minutes, this is the one to use.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product in the past and it seemed thicker</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it dries rock hard and shiny.</li>
            <li> It extends my manicure by at least a week</li>
            <li> I have tried cuticle oil, hair dryer, cold water and ice cubes to quickly dry my nails.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to anyone that is a nail fanatic!</li>
            <li> I use it along with the Orly Bonder base coat and my manicure lasts a long time!  </li>
            <li> but I was a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so thankful it exists although difficult to find in stores.</li>
            <li> Really disappointed.</li>
            <li> I use a gel polish (NOT gelish) as a base, two coats of ridge filler, then two coats of polish.</li>

            <li> Love. Your manicure last so much longer.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  It extends my manicure by at least a week and it dries the polish so I can wash dishes within an hour with no effect. I never do a manicure without it.</li>
            <li> AMAZING!  I can&#x27;t believe how quickly this dries my polish!  I use it along with the Orly Bonder base coat and my manicure lasts a long time!  Highly recommend!</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m so glad with my Orly Sec N Dry!!&lt;br /&gt;This is Amazing!!! &#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;This has just change my life!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so happy and I gave for present to a friends!!</li>
            <li> This is by far the  best nail drying polish I&#x27;ve ever used.  Dries almost  instantly,  creates a nice glossy look,  and seals your polish on your nails. I use this with Orly Bonder as my base coat and  my manicure stays perfect for 5-7  days with no chipping. I  also love that it doesn&#x27;t smear your polish like some other drying polishes do.  Terrific, I&#x27;ve purchased this several times over and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I paint my nails once or twice a week, and I do nail art. I have tried cuticle oil, hair dryer, cold water and ice cubes to quickly dry my nails. This is the only thing that has worked. I use a gel polish (NOT gelish) as a base, two coats of ridge filler, then two coats of polish. Then I apply nail art and I let my polish dry somewhat, because if I don&#x27;t, the colors will run when this product is applied. Otherwise, it dries rock hard and shiny. Love it!</li>
            <li> Best top coat ever! This nail polish is great.. It dries so fast and leaves a nice shiny finish! I recommend this product to anyone that is a nail fanatic!</li>
            <li> I have tried many topcoat/quick dry products. This is the one I keep going back to. It gives the glossiest shine that lasts for days.</li>
            <li> I tried this product after using Orly Bonder for the first time with great success. My hypothesis was that Orly&#x27;s top-coat product might be as great as its base-coat product. I was impressed by how quickly one coat of this lightweight polish helps to set the layers of polish underneath. Typically, I have to wait for close to an hour after polishing to do much of anything at all with my hands. This product allowed me to be back at my computer typing within 10 minutes of finishing my nails! (I might have been able to get back to work sooner, but I was being cautious:)</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t afford getting a manicure in a salon. Every time I would paint my finger nails at home, they would chip by the end of the day, which is such a waste of time. This top coat makes my at-home manicure last, so much longer. Now I can go days without chips! It doesn&#x27;t work with all of my nail polish though (Sally Hansen nail polish does not like this top coat).</li>
            <li> This is the greatest nail dryer, ever!! I will never buy anything else.</li>
            <li> This was part of a gift basket. Wow! I am amazed and pleased! This top cost truly lives up to its name!</li>
            <li> I simply love this product.</li>
            <li> This product smear the nail art!! I prefer the sally hansen product the quality of the product is much better.</li>
            <li> I tried putting this on wet Orly polish, and it just smeared it. It didn&#x27;t work as advertised. Really disappointed.</li>
            <li> I had expected a thicker product. I have purchased this product in the past and it seemed thicker but it may have been an older bottle. Quality is good but I was a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Dries nails much faster than other top coats.  Would buy it again and recommend to all.  Thank you</li>
            <li> I mentioned this in my other review. This is a fabulous top coat. There&#x27;s a newer one out where you hold your hands up to a light and it dries through two coats. I bought that one recently. Orly is pretty good. I highly recommend Orly products. you won&#x27;t have to do your nail as often either.</li>
            <li> THE BEST EVER!!! I tried OPI and other drying products, but nothing comes close to this. I love this product so much and I&#x27;m so thankful it exists although difficult to find in stores. I can do my nails before bed ( sometimes in bed) go to bed within minutes and still have flawless manicure in the morning. It also gives my nails a shine and thickness-LOVE LOVE LOVE this!!!</li>
            <li> This product does dry in seconds.</li>
            <li> This polish gives your nails a fantastic shine and it dries your nails very quickly. If you need to polish your nails and be on the go in less than 30 minutes, this is the one to use. Love it!</li>
