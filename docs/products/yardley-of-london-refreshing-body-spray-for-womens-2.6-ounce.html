            <li>Smelled great and a good price</li>
            <li>The transaction was a good one.</li>
            <li>I  have always loved YARDLEY products and used them all my life.</li>
            <li>I have loved all Yardley Lavender products until I tried the &amp;#34;body spray&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>but it did not disappoint has a wonderful lavender fragrance not over powering..was delivered very fast..</li>
            <li>It was better!</li>
            <li>I really enjoy using it and get a lot of compliments on how good it smells.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t even come close to being a refreshing lavender fragrance.  </li>
            <li>and I am sure I will be throwing it away.</li>
            <li>The spray was OK..</li>
            <li>If you like lavender you will love this..</li>
            <li>it has more of a perfumey smell...</li>
            <li>it came within days of my ordering it. :)</li>
            <li>When I make the bed in the morning, I like to spray the top of the comforter with the lavender scent.</li>
            <li>It is not too strong.  </li>
            <li>The scent is very nice, and is strong enough without being cloying.</li>
            <li>Definitely liked but much would rather have an oil spray  also</li>
            <li>Yardley is great lasting fragrance!</li>
            <li>My Yardley of London lavender body spray arrived on time, the scent is soft and clean,I am very satisfied both with the price and the product.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, the seller listed the ingredients within the description which indicated that the scent would not be pure lavender</li>
            <li>Nonetheless, it has plenty of lavender hints and is reminiscent of a walk through an herbal garden on a warm summer&#x27;s day.</li>
            <li>the old yardley shaving loation is no longer available</li>
            <li>The seller got back to me very quickly&#x27;</li>
            <li>Shipped fast.</li>
            <li>I was very  desapointed with this purchase.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery and just what I wanted</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t think the price I paid was reasonable.</li>
            <li>but I do like the classic Yardley&#x27;s scent.</li>
            <li>i love the scent of yardley english lavender soap and lotion but this is slightly different.</li>
            <li>was new to me..</li>
            <li>This body spray really smells like English Lavender.  </li>
            <li>the price was OK, but the container was very small</li>
            <li>Really nice but too small to last a long time.</li>

            <li> I wa surprised to see that this little bottle was shipped from the UK.</li>
            <li> just not exactly what i was looking for.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected sounds odd, but it wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> VERY slight lavender scent.</li>
            <li> It is unfortunate one is not able to smell this before buying.  </li>
            <li> This smells awful.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> Not as lavendery as I was hoping but like it all the same.  It&#x27;s fragrance is rose-like.</li>
            <li> Smells great! Shipped fast.</li>
            <li> I was very  desapointed with this purchase.  Smells like men&#x27;s cologne, not feminin at all</li>
            <li> The transaction was a good one. Fortunately, the seller listed the ingredients within the description which indicated that the scent would not be pure lavender so I was not expecting it to be. Nonetheless, it has plenty of lavender hints and is reminiscent of a walk through an herbal garden on a warm summer&#x27;s day.</li>
            <li> Definitely liked but much would rather have an oil spray  also the old yardley shaving loation is no longer available</li>
            <li> It is unfortunate one is not able to smell this before buying.  I thought I would try something different.  I wish I hadn&#x27;t.  This smells awful.  Like a cross between antiseptic and a bathroom deodorizer.</li>
            <li> VERY slight lavender scent.</li>
            <li> My Yardley of London lavender body spray arrived on time, the scent is soft and clean,I am very satisfied both with the price and the product.</li>

            <li> Smelled great and a good price</li>
            <li> all I can smell is the butane &amp; propane - no lavender!  want to return this.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and just what I wanted</li>
            <li> It did not smell like English lavendar.</li>
            <li> Came as described. Gave it four stars only because the delivery wasn&#x27;t as promised,but after contacting the seller ,it was explained for the delay and delivery was speedy. The seller got back to me very quickly&#x27;</li>
            <li> Really nice but too small to last a long time.</li>
            <li> The scent is very nice, and is strong enough without being cloying. What I don&#x27;t like is that the spray comes out in a big blast. The directions say hold about 6&amp;#34; away but I find I need to hold it about 8&amp;#34; to 10&amp;#34; away, or I get the big blast! I probably would not buy another one but I do like the classic Yardley&#x27;s scent.</li>
            <li> The spray was OK..the price was OK, but the container was very small so I don&#x27;t think the price I paid was reasonable.</li>
            <li> was new to me..but it did not disappoint has a wonderful lavender fragrance not over powering..was delivered very fast..If you like lavender you will love this..</li>

            <li> I must say, this lavender body spray is great. It can be used when exiting the shower, or even as a room air freshner. I find the lavender scent to be very nice. When I make the bed in the morning, I like to spray the top of the comforter with the lavender scent. The scent of lavender is so relaxing.</li>
