            <li> I love this brush set. Very useful and soft</li>
            <li> Great! Complete and easy to travel with.</li>
            <li> This is a really great make up brush set. I like that I can take it with me on the go but I started using these as my main make up brushes. They are good quality and I would recommend them to any one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the set almost everyday. These brushes are so sturdy, great size, strong handle and soft bristle. They&#x27;re bigger than average travel size brushes. They&#x27;re not falling apart even after I pulled the hair out many times. Very easy to blend, no strong odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The set comes in a nice box and a mirror case.  It&#x27;s so beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;I will update my review in two month (Hopefully the quality is still the same) . I am looking forward to try other make up brushes from Be You, Beautifully&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure : I purchased this brush set using a coupon code (discounted rate) and I was under no obligation to review it if I so chose. Nor was I under any obligation to write a positive review.</li>
            <li> Product is as described. A great company to do business with. Love the wonderfully soft bristles! I also like the shorter handles on brushes which these have. Smart little snap closure pouch to protect the brushes when traveling.”  One brush doesn&#x27;t stay put as the place it goes in is too large.</li>
            <li> Super nice travel brush set by Be You, Beautifully. The mini brushes are so soft and high quality. The bristles are all firmly in place, no shedding at all. The brushes are wonderful and apply my makeup beautifully. The case is noce. I love this little case. It&#x27;s so convienient for traveling. There is one brush that doesn&#x27;t stay in its space when open. The elastic is too big for it to stay put. But otherwise, nice set. *sample provided to review</li>
            <li> Nice brushes with a perfect compact case. I couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li> I needed a decent set of makeup brushes for travel and now I have them.  Impressive set, doesn&#x27;t shed, easy to handle.  This set would be great for gift giving also as it is nicely packaged.  Highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure of Material Connection: I have not received any compensation for writing this post.

            <li> I love how portable this is...This is about the size of samsung Note 4 phone. I love that there&#x27;s a mirror attached to the brush case. Very convenient design and the brush is soft want feels delicate to my face.</li>
            <li> I’ve watched dozens of youtube videos and try to recreate looks which ends up being a hot mess. I’m not a professional makeup artist so I depend on tutorials to try and improve my skills. The one thing I notice that all these beauty gurus have in common are good quality brushes. I travel a lot and the hassle of trying to figure out what brush to take is a pain. Most travel brushes suck, the bristles are hard and super flat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally got a set that is as good as its full size set in a travel set. The Be You Beautifully is absolutely the hands down the best travel set I’ve ever used. Each handle is embossed with the name and what it can be used for. Of course you can use your brush any way you want, but I find it extremely annoying when beauty gurus say “ I’m using such and such brush #f80” like what does that tell me. Nothing.. Who has time for that?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The set comes in a leather case with gold stitching, with felt inside and a mirror. This 5 piece set is made of hypoallergenic vegan synthetic bristles. This is great for any skin type. Each brush has its own little slot so it stays in place. Once snapped closed it’s the size of a small wallet.Read more ›</li>
            <li> Looooove these! Their the perfect size so they&#x27;ll fit easily in my purse or suitcase when I&#x27;m out in case I need to touch up or do my makeup on the go!</li>
            <li> Perfect size for travel. Nice set of brushes with a sturdy case.</li>
            <li> I am a traveler. Bringing every full size makeup brush you own is just a pain in the booty. Thankfully, this luxurious set has everything I need to get me through the day. The bristles are nice and thick but very soft. I have had no problems with shedding. The heads are attached very well at the handle as well. I really like the carrying case because it has a mirror and snaps together tightly to keep the brushes in place. This stays in my purse at all times! This would make a great gift for the girl that&#x27;s always on the go!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I received this set at special promotional rate for reviewing purposes, all opinions are my own</li>
            <li> Cute little makeup set! I love carrying extra small brushes in my purse makeup bag and these definitely fit the bill! The very best thing, to me, is the little brush shield that comes with the powder brush... it is so adorable!!&lt;br /&gt;These are soft and feel great. They are just what I need for a quick makeup application or touch up. I most frequently use a brush to reapply my concealer or a little more brush and I&#x27;m totally able to do that with these. Love!&lt;br /&gt;Luckily, I was so excited to be able to receive and review this item from the seller in exchange for my honest opinion!</li>
            <li> This set is perfect for travel, but I have to admit that I use it almost every day at home too...  The brushes are extremely well made!</li>
            <li> Love it! Would order again!</li>
            <li> I was very surprised at the quality of these brushes. The fine bristles do not shed and stay in place perfectly to allow a smooth application when applying your makeup. Great price for a top quality brush set. The case is also very nice and perfect size for traveling.</li>
            <li> Great makeup brushes! Makeup goes on smooth and the bristles don&#x27;t come out.</li>
            <li> These brushes are awesome</li>
            <li> Great product. Perfect size for travel or daily use. Very soft brushes. I&#x27;m not a pro brush user, so I don&#x27;t know how these compare to the ultra fancy (read: expensive) brushes, but I&#x27;m pleased with them for sure. Great compact carrying case.</li>
            <li> I ordered these brushes in exchange of a review and I absolutely love them!  They work so well with my makeup and allows my makeup to go on smoothly.  Definitely would buy these again.</li>
            <li> Love this product -- It lives up to it&#x27;s name. I will definitely use it again ~~ Thanks for the great deal too !</li>
            <li> This was a great purchase! Everything shipped and arrived as quickly as promised. It is a very good product and a great value for the price!</li>
            <li> I love these brushes I use them everyday.  They are so soft, and work fantastic.  They don&#x27;t loose bristles and apply my makeup perfect!  Having them travel size with the bonus travel pouch is an added benefit.  I would absolutely recommend them for a set of brushes that are a great price and work fantastic !</li>
            <li> Honestly, I am a cheap person. I have always used the crummy little brushes that come with the eyeshadow...or I would &amp;#34;splurge&amp;#34; a little buying those $1 Elf-type brushes. I never could quite figure out how people did their eyeshadow so flawlessly...no matter how much time or effort, I could not get it to really blend right. As it turns out, the problem was not ME - - it was the crummy brushes! I am so incredibly happy with this travel set! After just one use, they are now my daily brushes until I purchase a full-size set. They feel like cashmere on my eyelids...so soft! No more clumpy looking shadow - they blend instantly! I am so happy to have found them!!!</li>
            <li> This kit is just the right size and can fit in any makeup bag or pouch. The case is leather and has a really convenient mirror and holds the brushes separately and sturdy. The brushes themselves are black with gold ferrules and have synthetic bristles. They are a great size as well, great for the face and eyes. *I received this kit for review purposes, but all my opinions are honest</li>
            <li> This was a great purchase!  Everything shipped and arrived as quickly as promised.  It is a very good product and a great value for the price!</li>
            <li> This travel brush set is just amazing. It has all the small precise brushes that you need for your eyes. The brushes are very well made and the bristles are so soft. I haven&#x27;t had any trouble with the bristles falling out. The set comes in a really great carrying case It comes with 5 unique brushes. A crease brush that is perfect for blending in the crease of your eyes. A base brush for apply eye shadow to the lid of your eyes. A accent brush for the precise shadow around the edge of your eyes. A brow brush for the perfect brow. A fine liner for your liquid eye liner. Everything you need for the perfect set of eyes every time. I would recommend this set of brushes. Sample received for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> I took this brush set on vacation with me.  They worked great and were a good size for travel.</li>
            <li> Purchased this travel size makeup brushes set for my wife. These are Adorable and Great Quality!&lt;br /&gt;She was quite surprised of the great quality of these brushes. It is really convenient to bring this brush set to travel.&lt;br /&gt;She was surprised how much she reach for them even when not traveling. Wash up nicely and very useful.&lt;br /&gt;The set has all you need.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;*** I received this product at a discount for my honest feedback.</li>
            <li> High quality brushes!</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing! I want more of them lol. I actually threw away some of my other makeup brushes because these are so wonderful.  Perfect size and shape and the case they come in is quality. These brushes and their case won&#x27;t be falling apart</li>
            <li> Nice and compact, and super soft brushes. Great quality item! We really like it.</li>
            <li> This came just in time for vacation.  I hadn&#x27;t noticed the case when ordering, and was pleasantly surprised at how sleek it was.  Very expensive looking. The brushes are amazing.  I love that the the case is so small and easy to travel with or even just leave in your bag permanently.  All the brushes you need in one case, and as an added bonus, a nice sized mirror. The best thing is the quality.  I have gone through so many brush kits, and single brushes (3 daughters plus myself adds up to a lot of beauty products!) that just were not up to my standards.  This kit is!  The brushes are soft and fluffly, but do not fall apart.  There is nothing so disappointing as getting your makeup on perfectly and then having to ruin it because you have to brush away all the bristles that fell out!  This does not happen with these brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!  Extremely satified!</li>
            <li> nice brushes, well made</li>
