            <li>which is so great</li>
            <li>I thought it was going to be great like everyone said.</li>

            <li>If you want to feel more like spring, buy this, it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>Try it and you&#x27;ll be thrilled!  </li>
            <li>Woke up in the morning with a nice color!</li>
            <li>I thought I was in good hands, given all the great reviews for this product -</li>
            <li>like I thought it would be) and the tan looks really good.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m Irish/Scottish, so I&#x27;ve had plenty of experiences with self tanners; some good, some not so good.  </li>
            <li>So, bottom line, follow the instructions because they are really good.</li>
            <li>My face and arms looked good.  </li>
            <li>For my hands, I&#x27;ve found that washing my hands after rubbing lotion over the tanned areas is good for removing the excess self tanner from them.  </li>
            <li>and I wasn&#x27;t very satisfied with the results.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice smell and I loved the results and would recommend it.</li>
            <li>I will definately buy more of the tanner, and I have already told my mom and sister about this!</li>
            <li>But the color is perfect and after this first application of learning the ropes</li>
            <li>I will be placing an order for more cans tonight!  </li>
            <li>Try it, you will LOVE it!</li>
            <li>I can see the streakiness but everywhere else looks really amazing.    </li>
            <li>I am ordering more spray and am a happy customer :)</li>
            <li>Make sure to apply the lotion afterwards, and do it with good ventilation.</li>
            <li>Thanks for this great product!</li>
            <li>and it was very easy to apply.</li>
            <li>SheerTan is far and away the best thing I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>and this is the best by far.  </li>
            <li>a good tanner is important to me.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best product.</li>
            <li>It also emits a very fine mist, which I like a lot.  </li>
            <li>For beautiful glow and instant results I love Lancome self bronzer Medium Colour Oil-Free Tinted Self-Tanning Lotion for Face (all Lancomes selftan products are great).</li>
            <li>The wand is easy, it dries super quick and with the appliction instructions, the color turns out perfect every time.  </li>
            <li>The product itself seemed great: it smelled nice, and the fine-mist spray was super cool.  </li>
            <li>It sprays very light</li>
            <li>I found the product to be nicely made, easy to use and handle.  </li>
            <li>You better know what you are doing before using this.  </li>
            <li>but I did have to reapply it more often on my face because I wash my face twice a day</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used different self tanners and this one is def the best!!</li>
            <li>Sheer tan is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>I will be ordering more.  </li>
            <li>Overall, a wonderful product that I would recommend!!</li>
            <li>You also get MANY applications with SheerTan.</li>
            <li>I have tried many including this one</li>
            <li>The spray itself smells better than any I&#x27;ve ever used before.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using spray tan booths and airbrush tans for some time and this is so much better because 1)</li>
            <li>Be sure to use the lotion after as the directions indicate.  </li>
            <li>The Sheer Tan Sunless Tanning Wand is an awesome invention!     </li>
            <li>have found the best way to apply is to wear gloves, spray the body, then rub in the moisturizer all over (it says only use on knobby areas of arms and legs</li>
            <li>I will just have to apply more often to my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Maybe that is why I had better results than others with fairer skin.</li>
            <li>I immediately rubbed moisturizers on the arms as directed by the instructions to make sure the knobby parts of your body come out evenly.</li>
            <li>if you looked closely you could see that it was spray tanned, but I&#x27;m ok with that.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been tanning for years and have tried most everything</li>
            <li>and I love that it folds up.    </li>
            <li>This is a fantastic Product!  </li>
            <li>and I love their products.  </li>
            <li>i think I will know better what to do better.  </li>
            <li>so I haven&#x27;t been able to use it yet....</li>
            <li>I would love to use this product</li>
            <li>I got better results with Jergens gradual tanning lotion than with this</li>
            <li>I really love it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I took the leap and tried this system.  </li>
            <li>I use it after every shower and I am able to keep up the tan.  </li>
            <li>The color is pretty good too.</li>
            <li>This one is the best do-it-yourself tanning spray I&#x27;ve tried in a long time.  </li>
            <li>But I am happy with the product so far and plan on continuing to use it.</li>
            <li>if very professional and courteous, she refunded my money and gave me some nice tips on how to apply the tan.</li>
            <li>But other than that this is a wonderful product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to pop this in your bag and travel with it</li>
            <li>Quite honestly, I wasn&#x27;t sure if all the reviews were actually real</li>
            <li>I do tan easily in the summer.</li>
            <li>So easy to apply</li>
            <li>I can reach all parts easily.  </li>
            <li>Fairly easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>Easy to apply, does not turn you orange, and smell is not unbearable.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t have a strong odor.  </li>
            <li>This product smelled fine.  </li>
            <li>Followed directions and have used more than once to make sure it was consistent.</li>
            <li>The bottle of spray goes quick though!  </li>
            <li>The color was very nice and developed well and had no bad odor at all.</li>
            <li>The wand is a cheap piece of plastic.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll have a fantastic tan in about 8 hours.</li>
            <li>but it did a fantastic job.  </li>
            <li>I WAS SO AMAZED when I found this goes on lightly</li>
            <li>AFTER you rub in all the moisturizer, then take off the gloves and spray your hands lightly.</li>
            <li>Overall a great product which I will recommend to friends.</li>
            <li>It really looks like I have a nice glow.  </li>
            <li>It really works wonderful for reaching the back part of the body.</li>
            <li>This product works, you just have to be sure you wear latex gloves and apply lotion right after you apply the spray.</li>
            <li>It was super easy to apply, but be sure to use lotion rub it in right after you apply.  </li>
            <li>cuz I don&#x27;t need help from anyone, and with the evenness of the spray, getting a tan is super easy.  </li>
            <li>I think the Body Drench&#x27;s Quick Tan is a far superior product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so excited by this product that I already bought it for my sister as a gift for the summer.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>Every summer since I can remember, I&#x27;ve been self-conscious about my white legs - there was even taunting when I was in grade school, so my quest for the perfect self-tanning product to cover my porcelain pins began young.</li>
            <li>SheerTan satisfied every qualification that I was looking for in a sunless tanner: it&#x27;s easy to apply, it lasts for three days before you need to shave your legs/exfoliate and reapply, and it gives me realistic colour.</li>
            <li>I have to get the technique a tad better, but overall very easy to use.</li>
            <li>I am a strawberry blonde with fair skin.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t tan a lot but saw this and thought it was a cool idea.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s possible to make this look good</li>
            <li>I tried to do my whole body but won&#x27;t be trying that again.&lt;br /&gt;I will be ordering more of the product, it&#x27;s not sticky and as self tanners go, it not too stinky either.</li>
            <li>Read easy to follow directions first....  </li>
            <li>Very user friendly, I would&#x27;ve never believed that I could do this myself!</li>
            <li>I also like that it dries fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>But I took off one star because of the quick fading of the face/neck area, and one star because this doesnt have a built in bronzer</li>
            <li>So I had tried Clinique when I was pregnant and could not tolerate the smell of it</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised that it was a very easy to use sprayer (not flimsy</li>
            <li>In retrospect, I wish I had waited out the night for the first coat, because I think it would have looked amazing and not too \\&quot;wow</li>
            <li>found this tanner to be very effective and the results were the equivalent to what I get with a spray tan in a salon, although it does not come out as dark.</li>
            <li>Love it and completely recommend it!</li>
            <li>Sheer Tan seemed to be the most appealing---and this product is A+!  </li>
            <li>For airplane travelling, when I take carry on only I love Tan Towel Toweletts, another winner!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have time to spend 10-15 minutes putting on self tanner, making sure that I applied it all over evenly while there is a three year old running around.</li>
            <li>It provides a much more natural looking tan.</li>
            <li>It is definitely something you can do on your own.</li>
            <li>After all, I spend close to $50 on ONE spray tan session that lasts maybe 5 days, so to me it was worth shelling out $50 for this product if it does what it says.</li>
            <li>But by the morning I had a nice glow and it was obvious that I was tanner.</li>
            <li>but with the instructions you provided, I know it will be a success in making me look tan.</li>
            <li>I would say the directions we not all that clear so do some more research online on the application process if you get that &amp;</li>
            <li>Light, easy, barely smells.  </li>
            <li>right after you spray</li>
            <li>The SheerTan Sunless System is very easy, especially using the Wand.  </li>
            <li>In general, i think this product gives you a tan that is more orange than brown.  </li>
            <li>This was an okay item very cheap and every spray I put in there leaked badly waste of product</li>
            <li>When I compare the whole experience to mystic tan SheerTan wins-it doesn&#x60;t smell, leaves clothes clean, not expensive, I don&#x60;t have to drive to tan salon.   </li>
            <li>It is comparably inexpensive, can easily be self-applied in a very short time, and creates a no-streak golden tan!  </li>
            <li>It has good overall color with an airbrush quality soft spray.  </li>
            <li>To wrap up this review, if you&#x27;re looking for a natural tan that&#x27;s affordable, easy to apply, gives consistent colour and will fool your friends, just buy SheerTan.</li>
            <li>Now that I have done it once I&#x27;m sure next time</li>
            <li>I derive a certain pleasure from doing it myself and feel like it&#x27;s just the right thing for me.    </li>
            <li>The wand is interesting, but actually, I haven&#x27;t used it yet.  </li>
            <li>What I like best is that you don&#x27;t have to use the wand all over, just for those places that are difficult to get to.</li>
            <li>really works!</li>
            <li>I wanted to get rid of some of my winter white skin because it makes me feel better to have some color.  </li>
            <li>After being in the sailing charter business for many years, my sun exposure caught up with me, and I knew I had to arrive at an alternate plan.  </li>
            <li>The smell is ok but as it develops the inevitable tanning smell appears, which is fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It comes with exact instructions, which I followed.</li>
            <li>Thanks SheerTan!</li>
            <li>Thanks Sheertan!</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time yesterday evening</li>
            <li>I used the directions exactly as stated.</li>
            <li>It was pretty embarassing when I had to put my swim suit on and get in the water.</li>
            <li>Let me say that I put the first layer on somewhat cautiously, and followed their instructions.</li>
            <li>The remaining 20 reviews or 87% rated a 4 star or higher.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>The wand is pretty nifty.</li>
            <li>The spray is light, does not stain your bathroom or clothes, has little smell and the wand makes application super easy.  </li>
            <li>It might take a little practice but what I did was apply a light layer the first time and then as I got better</li>
            <li>if you think of using any other kind of spray with the wand, unless the size fits and it is an aerosol spray</li>
            <li>If just makes me feel I look healthy and have been given several compliments on my tan even from my son, who is very picky.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve honestly had better results with store bought self tanning lotions (seriously!).    </li>
            <li>Thank you so much for getting this to me so fast!</li>
            <li>I was so overjoyed when I discovered not only was it easy to use</li>
            <li>Wow super</li>
            <li>Be careful when spraying your feet, go very light</li>
            <li>but I missed being tan sooo much.</li>
            <li>I am very fair-skinned</li>
            <li>It gets really spendy, really fast.     </li>
            <li>As another reviewer mentioned, this seems to wash off the face and neck much faster than the rest of the body.</li>
            <li>so I have been using it on the whole leg, whole arm, etc).</li>
            <li>Afterward, I started searching for an alternative at home spray tan that was a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>There is nothing much you can really do about the runs if you leave them to turn brown so this technique proved to eliminate that.    </li>
            <li>depends what results I need, how much time I have etc.</li>
            <li>but now I am doubting if they are even real.    </li>
            <li>I did like the wand; it made application much easier.  </li>
            <li>It gathered on my hands (even though I had wiped them off afterwards) and turned them very orange.  </li>
            <li>very spotty.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like to use it on my face.</li>
            <li>Haha what a joke.</li>
            <li>So much safer than tanning beds and much easier than driving to a salon or having someone come to my house.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>- the wand is awesome and easy to use,  - the spray is great; very light and clear,  - tan came out even and really natural (for more dramatic results I can reapply the next day), last long and fades gradually,  - the fragrance is not overpowering, although next day in the morning I recognized this specific selftan smell (not strong,</li>
            <li>But if you want an even, natural looking tan, this is it!!!</li>
            <li>** UPDATED on 4/11/12&lt;br /&gt;After using this several times, I would rate it 3 stars (I originally rated it 4).</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, I knew it has to be too good to be true.</li>
            <li>In fact, I got a professional airbrush tan a year ago and the results I got with SheerTan are just as nice -- only for the price of one airbrush tan, you can buy this product and get multiple spray tans out of it -- all you need to buy after the starter kit are refills.  </li>
            <li>Only using the product on my full legs, I get 15 applications out of one can.</li>
            <li>I love the sprayer because it can get all those nooks and cranies really well that I sometimes miss (like the middle of my back).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll make this short &amp; sweet.  </li>
            <li>One can last about 4 full body applications.  </li>
            <li>And the wand will make it so much easier to apply to areas normally unreachable.</li>
            <li>I am extremely fair and avoid the sun at all costs (cover ups and sunscreen) due to burning and freckling and of course the long term effects of wrinkling and skin cancer.  </li>
            <li>I did notice that I missed a place on my back, so be sure to look in the mirror when applying it the back!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I bought this product b/c of all the great reviews which now I know are FAKE.</li>
            <li>Those my top products after few years of trying and searching.  </li>
            <li>My friends make fun of me because I&#x27;m so white.  </li>
            <li>first bottle was broken, the seller was really nice, she send a replacement product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, in summary, I will still use this product because it is reasonably priced, easy to use once a little trial and error is done, and gets me tan without using the sun, a tanning bed, or a $50 per session spray tan.</li>
            <li>This is a new thing I&#x27;ve not heard of to put on moisturizer on</li>
            <li>oh we have a NEW version of it.</li>
            <li>It was kind of hard to know you were applying evenly because it goes on clear.  </li>
            <li>I was very careful to spray lightly and evenly.  </li>
            <li>As a mother of a three year old and three month old, I like how fast it is to apply too.</li>
            <li>It really gets every area you need to get and without the embarrassment of having to have someone see you bare!</li>
            <li>The color of the tanner came out looking very natural, not orange at all.</li>
            <li>The wand is pretty high quality and thick but light</li>
            <li>Many of the ones I have used in the past have streaked and I just couldn&#x27;t get them even.  </li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>For one application dark color, no strikes and smooth skin</li>
            <li>I wore a mask because the fumes were a little strong.</li>
            <li>It dried very quickly and did not get all over my clothes.  </li>
            <li>I have only used this twice, but so far I really like it!</li>
            <li>Truly, because of the wand, I&#x27;m able to reach down my back</li>
            <li>I wanted to be sure I followed the application rules correctly the first time, so I only used a little spray, but I noticed a definite difference!</li>
            <li>The spray dries pretty fast but leaves that clamy feeling like all the other so just have to endure the time it takes to go away.</li>
            <li>The light mist goes on easier than the grocery-store tanners and the wand, though it takes a little getting used to, gets those hard-to-reach places.</li>
            <li>the formula is clear so you cant see where you applied it.</li>
            <li>I was ready for that extra lift a tan can give.    </li>
            <li>Hats off to the girl who developed this and anyone else who participated.  </li>
            <li>But be sure to not wash your hands or get them wet for hours - I found that out when I attempted to wash dishes 2 hours after application and woke up the next day with a tan arm and white</li>
            <li>Overall, I really like the wand and give the spray an A</li>
            <li>I get this natural looking tan.</li>
            <li>If you prep your skin properly, it works very well.  </li>
            <li>wow was I tan.</li>
            <li>It&#x60;s really useful, I can finally apply selftan to my back without help or doing gymnastics.</li>
            <li>If you want a super dark tan, then one application will not do it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried sunless tanning at the salons and used other at home products (even the more expensive types) and NONE work as well, look as good or last as long.  </li>
            <li>I did several coats, not knowing how dark or light it would be when it develops - there is no color when you spray it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m warning everyone on amazon that sees all the good reviews above me are fake.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a natural blonde, and now that my brother had melanoma, I figured it&#x27;s time to protect my skin, rather than fry it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say I was drawn to this product to test out not only how the color developed on my skin type (which is semi-fair to medium) but, also, for the convenience it portrays.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The new kind is similar to the Fake Bake spray you apply in the shower only.</li>
            <li>(though I can&#x27;t verify) all over, but since I have such few occasions to self tan, I think it would be worth it to spend the money on a professional spray tan in the future.</li>
            <li>And because I&#x27;m so white, and I don&#x27;t have any kind of base tan, what&#x27;s cool about SheerTan</li>
            <li>Over the years, I&#x27;ve used every type of sunless tanning product starting with that orangy Avon lotion in the early 1980s; I&#x27;ve utilized tanning booths and gave up after thirteen sessions and only a burn to show for it; and I&#x27;ve booth spray tanned and airbrush spray tanned with \\&quot;professionals\\&quot;, but how often do you want to shell out $50-$80 for four days of being tan?</li>
            <li>Highly recommend the wand to anyone who has spent a fortune on spray tanning!  </li>
            <li>I ordered it because the past few years, I have not been able to make it in the sun or to a tanning bed to get ANY color (we started a family)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m Irish and pretty pale</li>
            <li>Also, in the 1 or 2 of the spots where I got lazy and didn&#x27;t apply the lotion (back of right ankle)</li>
            <li>My left leg ended up being VERY blotchy, but I noticed some blotchiness all over, though it was less pronounced.  </li>
            <li>The spray is definitely on the high end, you get just the average 4 times max, if that out of one bottle.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> which is so great</li>
            <li> I thought it was going to be great like everyone said.</li>

            <li> I thought I was in good hands, given all the great reviews for this product -</li>
            <li> like I thought it would be) and the tan looks really good.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Irish/Scottish, so I&#x27;ve had plenty of experiences with self tanners; some good, some not so good.  </li>
            <li> So, bottom line, follow the instructions because they are really good.</li>
            <li> My face and arms looked good.  </li>
            <li> For my hands, I&#x27;ve found that washing my hands after rubbing lotion over the tanned areas is good for removing the excess self tanner from them.  </li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t very satisfied with the results.  </li>
            <li> It has a nice smell and I loved the results and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I will definately buy more of the tanner, and I have already told my mom and sister about this!</li>
            <li> But the color is perfect and after this first application of learning the ropes</li>
            <li> I will be placing an order for more cans tonight!  </li>
            <li> Try it, you will LOVE it!</li>
            <li> I can see the streakiness but everywhere else looks really amazing.    </li>
            <li> I am ordering more spray and am a happy customer :)</li>
            <li> Make sure to apply the lotion afterwards, and do it with good ventilation.</li>
            <li> Thanks for this great product!</li>
            <li> and it was very easy to apply.</li>
            <li> SheerTan is far and away the best thing I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> and this is the best by far.  </li>
            <li> a good tanner is important to me.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best product.</li>
            <li> It also emits a very fine mist, which I like a lot.  </li>
            <li> For beautiful glow and instant results I love Lancome self bronzer Medium Colour Oil-Free Tinted Self-Tanning Lotion for Face (all Lancomes selftan products are great).</li>
            <li> The wand is easy, it dries super quick and with the appliction instructions, the color turns out perfect every time.  </li>
            <li> The product itself seemed great: it smelled nice, and the fine-mist spray was super cool.  </li>
            <li> It sprays very light</li>
            <li> I found the product to be nicely made, easy to use and handle.  </li>
            <li> You better know what you are doing before using this.  </li>
            <li> but I did have to reapply it more often on my face because I wash my face twice a day</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used different self tanners and this one is def the best!!</li>
            <li> Sheer tan is wonderful.  </li>
            <li> I will be ordering more.  </li>
            <li> Overall, a wonderful product that I would recommend!!</li>
            <li> You also get MANY applications with SheerTan.</li>
            <li> I have tried many including this one</li>
            <li> The spray itself smells better than any I&#x27;ve ever used before.</li>
            <li> Enjoy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using spray tan booths and airbrush tans for some time and this is so much better because 1)</li>
            <li> Be sure to use the lotion after as the directions indicate.  </li>
            <li> The Sheer Tan Sunless Tanning Wand is an awesome invention!     </li>
            <li> have found the best way to apply is to wear gloves, spray the body, then rub in the moisturizer all over (it says only use on knobby areas of arms and legs</li>
            <li> I will just have to apply more often to my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Maybe that is why I had better results than others with fairer skin.</li>
            <li> I immediately rubbed moisturizers on the arms as directed by the instructions to make sure the knobby parts of your body come out evenly.</li>
            <li> if you looked closely you could see that it was spray tanned, but I&#x27;m ok with that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been tanning for years and have tried most everything</li>
            <li> and I love that it folds up.    </li>
            <li> This is a fantastic Product!  </li>
            <li> and I love their products.  </li>
            <li> i think I will know better what to do better.  </li>
            <li> so I haven&#x27;t been able to use it yet....</li>
            <li> I would love to use this product</li>
            <li> I got better results with Jergens gradual tanning lotion than with this</li>
            <li> I really love it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I took the leap and tried this system.  </li>
            <li> I use it after every shower and I am able to keep up the tan.  </li>
            <li> The color is pretty good too.</li>
            <li> This one is the best do-it-yourself tanning spray I&#x27;ve tried in a long time.  </li>
            <li> But I am happy with the product so far and plan on continuing to use it.</li>
            <li> if very professional and courteous, she refunded my money and gave me some nice tips on how to apply the tan.</li>
            <li> But other than that this is a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy to pop this in your bag and travel with it</li>
            <li> Quite honestly, I wasn&#x27;t sure if all the reviews were actually real</li>
            <li> I do tan easily in the summer.</li>
            <li> So easy to apply</li>
            <li> I can reach all parts easily.  </li>
            <li> Fairly easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> Easy to apply, does not turn you orange, and smell is not unbearable.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t have a strong odor.  </li>
            <li> This product smelled fine.  </li>
            <li> Followed directions and have used more than once to make sure it was consistent.</li>
            <li> The bottle of spray goes quick though!  </li>
            <li> The color was very nice and developed well and had no bad odor at all.</li>
            <li> The wand is a cheap piece of plastic.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll have a fantastic tan in about 8 hours.</li>
            <li> but it did a fantastic job.  </li>
            <li> I WAS SO AMAZED when I found this goes on lightly</li>
            <li> AFTER you rub in all the moisturizer, then take off the gloves and spray your hands lightly.</li>
            <li> Overall a great product which I will recommend to friends.</li>
            <li> It really looks like I have a nice glow.  </li>
            <li> It really works wonderful for reaching the back part of the body.</li>
            <li> This product works, you just have to be sure you wear latex gloves and apply lotion right after you apply the spray.</li>
            <li> It was super easy to apply, but be sure to use lotion rub it in right after you apply.  </li>
            <li> cuz I don&#x27;t need help from anyone, and with the evenness of the spray, getting a tan is super easy.  </li>
            <li> I think the Body Drench&#x27;s Quick Tan is a far superior product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so excited by this product that I already bought it for my sister as a gift for the summer.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Every summer since I can remember, I&#x27;ve been self-conscious about my white legs - there was even taunting when I was in grade school, so my quest for the perfect self-tanning product to cover my porcelain pins began young.</li>
            <li> SheerTan satisfied every qualification that I was looking for in a sunless tanner: it&#x27;s easy to apply, it lasts for three days before you need to shave your legs/exfoliate and reapply, and it gives me realistic colour.</li>
            <li> I have to get the technique a tad better, but overall very easy to use.</li>
            <li> I am a strawberry blonde with fair skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t tan a lot but saw this and thought it was a cool idea.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s possible to make this look good</li>
            <li> I tried to do my whole body but won&#x27;t be trying that again.&lt;br /&gt;I will be ordering more of the product, it&#x27;s not sticky and as self tanners go, it not too stinky either.</li>
            <li> Read easy to follow directions first....  </li>
            <li> Very user friendly, I would&#x27;ve never believed that I could do this myself!</li>
            <li> I also like that it dries fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> But I took off one star because of the quick fading of the face/neck area, and one star because this doesnt have a built in bronzer</li>
            <li> So I had tried Clinique when I was pregnant and could not tolerate the smell of it</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised that it was a very easy to use sprayer (not flimsy</li>
            <li> In retrospect, I wish I had waited out the night for the first coat, because I think it would have looked amazing and not too \\&quot;wow</li>
            <li> found this tanner to be very effective and the results were the equivalent to what I get with a spray tan in a salon, although it does not come out as dark.</li>
            <li> Love it and completely recommend it!</li>
            <li> Sheer Tan seemed to be the most appealing---and this product is A+!  </li>
            <li> For airplane travelling, when I take carry on only I love Tan Towel Toweletts, another winner!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have time to spend 10-15 minutes putting on self tanner, making sure that I applied it all over evenly while there is a three year old running around.</li>
            <li> It provides a much more natural looking tan.</li>
            <li> It is definitely something you can do on your own.</li>
            <li> After all, I spend close to $50 on ONE spray tan session that lasts maybe 5 days, so to me it was worth shelling out $50 for this product if it does what it says.</li>
            <li> But by the morning I had a nice glow and it was obvious that I was tanner.</li>
            <li> but with the instructions you provided, I know it will be a success in making me look tan.</li>
            <li> I would say the directions we not all that clear so do some more research online on the application process if you get that &amp;</li>
            <li> Light, easy, barely smells.  </li>
            <li> right after you spray</li>
            <li> The SheerTan Sunless System is very easy, especially using the Wand.  </li>
            <li> In general, i think this product gives you a tan that is more orange than brown.  </li>
            <li> This was an okay item very cheap and every spray I put in there leaked badly waste of product</li>
            <li> When I compare the whole experience to mystic tan SheerTan wins-it doesn&#x60;t smell, leaves clothes clean, not expensive, I don&#x60;t have to drive to tan salon.   </li>
            <li> It is comparably inexpensive, can easily be self-applied in a very short time, and creates a no-streak golden tan!  </li>
            <li> It has good overall color with an airbrush quality soft spray.  </li>
            <li> To wrap up this review, if you&#x27;re looking for a natural tan that&#x27;s affordable, easy to apply, gives consistent colour and will fool your friends, just buy SheerTan.</li>
            <li> Now that I have done it once I&#x27;m sure next time</li>
            <li> I derive a certain pleasure from doing it myself and feel like it&#x27;s just the right thing for me.    </li>
            <li> The wand is interesting, but actually, I haven&#x27;t used it yet.  </li>
            <li> What I like best is that you don&#x27;t have to use the wand all over, just for those places that are difficult to get to.</li>
            <li> really works!</li>
            <li> I wanted to get rid of some of my winter white skin because it makes me feel better to have some color.  </li>
            <li> After being in the sailing charter business for many years, my sun exposure caught up with me, and I knew I had to arrive at an alternate plan.  </li>
            <li> The smell is ok but as it develops the inevitable tanning smell appears, which is fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It comes with exact instructions, which I followed.</li>
            <li> Thanks SheerTan!</li>
            <li> Thanks Sheertan!</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time yesterday evening</li>
            <li> I used the directions exactly as stated.</li>
            <li> It was pretty embarassing when I had to put my swim suit on and get in the water.</li>
            <li> Let me say that I put the first layer on somewhat cautiously, and followed their instructions.</li>
            <li> The remaining 20 reviews or 87% rated a 4 star or higher.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> The wand is pretty nifty.</li>
            <li> The spray is light, does not stain your bathroom or clothes, has little smell and the wand makes application super easy.  </li>
            <li> It might take a little practice but what I did was apply a light layer the first time and then as I got better</li>
            <li> if you think of using any other kind of spray with the wand, unless the size fits and it is an aerosol spray</li>
            <li> If just makes me feel I look healthy and have been given several compliments on my tan even from my son, who is very picky.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve honestly had better results with store bought self tanning lotions (seriously!).    </li>
            <li> Thank you so much for getting this to me so fast!</li>
            <li> I was so overjoyed when I discovered not only was it easy to use</li>
            <li> Wow super</li>
            <li> Be careful when spraying your feet, go very light</li>
            <li> but I missed being tan sooo much.</li>
            <li> I am very fair-skinned</li>
            <li> It gets really spendy, really fast.     </li>
            <li> As another reviewer mentioned, this seems to wash off the face and neck much faster than the rest of the body.</li>
            <li> so I have been using it on the whole leg, whole arm, etc).</li>
            <li> Afterward, I started searching for an alternative at home spray tan that was a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> There is nothing much you can really do about the runs if you leave them to turn brown so this technique proved to eliminate that.    </li>
            <li> depends what results I need, how much time I have etc.</li>
            <li> but now I am doubting if they are even real.    </li>
            <li> I did like the wand; it made application much easier.  </li>
            <li> It gathered on my hands (even though I had wiped them off afterwards) and turned them very orange.  </li>
            <li> very spotty.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like to use it on my face.</li>
            <li> Haha what a joke.</li>
            <li> So much safer than tanning beds and much easier than driving to a salon or having someone come to my house.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> - the wand is awesome and easy to use,  - the spray is great; very light and clear,  - tan came out even and really natural (for more dramatic results I can reapply the next day), last long and fades gradually,  - the fragrance is not overpowering, although next day in the morning I recognized this specific selftan smell (not strong,</li>
            <li> But if you want an even, natural looking tan, this is it!!!</li>
            <li> ** UPDATED on 4/11/12&lt;br /&gt;After using this several times, I would rate it 3 stars (I originally rated it 4).</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I knew it has to be too good to be true.</li>
            <li> In fact, I got a professional airbrush tan a year ago and the results I got with SheerTan are just as nice -- only for the price of one airbrush tan, you can buy this product and get multiple spray tans out of it -- all you need to buy after the starter kit are refills.  </li>
            <li> Only using the product on my full legs, I get 15 applications out of one can.</li>
            <li> I love the sprayer because it can get all those nooks and cranies really well that I sometimes miss (like the middle of my back).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll make this short &amp; sweet.  </li>
            <li> One can last about 4 full body applications.  </li>
            <li> And the wand will make it so much easier to apply to areas normally unreachable.</li>
            <li> I am extremely fair and avoid the sun at all costs (cover ups and sunscreen) due to burning and freckling and of course the long term effects of wrinkling and skin cancer.  </li>
            <li> I did notice that I missed a place on my back, so be sure to look in the mirror when applying it the back!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this product b/c of all the great reviews which now I know are FAKE.</li>
            <li> Those my top products after few years of trying and searching.  </li>
            <li> My friends make fun of me because I&#x27;m so white.  </li>
            <li> first bottle was broken, the seller was really nice, she send a replacement product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, in summary, I will still use this product because it is reasonably priced, easy to use once a little trial and error is done, and gets me tan without using the sun, a tanning bed, or a $50 per session spray tan.</li>
            <li> This is a new thing I&#x27;ve not heard of to put on moisturizer on</li>
            <li> oh we have a NEW version of it.</li>
            <li> It was kind of hard to know you were applying evenly because it goes on clear.  </li>
            <li> I was very careful to spray lightly and evenly.  </li>
            <li> As a mother of a three year old and three month old, I like how fast it is to apply too.</li>
            <li> It really gets every area you need to get and without the embarrassment of having to have someone see you bare!</li>
            <li> The color of the tanner came out looking very natural, not orange at all.</li>
            <li> The wand is pretty high quality and thick but light</li>
            <li> Many of the ones I have used in the past have streaked and I just couldn&#x27;t get them even.  </li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> For one application dark color, no strikes and smooth skin</li>
            <li> I wore a mask because the fumes were a little strong.</li>
            <li> It dried very quickly and did not get all over my clothes.  </li>
            <li> I have only used this twice, but so far I really like it!</li>
            <li> Truly, because of the wand, I&#x27;m able to reach down my back</li>
            <li> I wanted to be sure I followed the application rules correctly the first time, so I only used a little spray, but I noticed a definite difference!</li>
            <li> The spray dries pretty fast but leaves that clamy feeling like all the other so just have to endure the time it takes to go away.</li>
            <li> The light mist goes on easier than the grocery-store tanners and the wand, though it takes a little getting used to, gets those hard-to-reach places.</li>
            <li> the formula is clear so you cant see where you applied it.</li>
            <li> I was ready for that extra lift a tan can give.    </li>
            <li> Hats off to the girl who developed this and anyone else who participated.  </li>
            <li> But be sure to not wash your hands or get them wet for hours - I found that out when I attempted to wash dishes 2 hours after application and woke up the next day with a tan arm and white</li>
            <li> Overall, I really like the wand and give the spray an A</li>
            <li> I get this natural looking tan.</li>
            <li> If you prep your skin properly, it works very well.  </li>
            <li> wow was I tan.</li>
            <li> It&#x60;s really useful, I can finally apply selftan to my back without help or doing gymnastics.</li>
            <li> If you want a super dark tan, then one application will not do it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried sunless tanning at the salons and used other at home products (even the more expensive types) and NONE work as well, look as good or last as long.  </li>
            <li> I did several coats, not knowing how dark or light it would be when it develops - there is no color when you spray it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m warning everyone on amazon that sees all the good reviews above me are fake.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a natural blonde, and now that my brother had melanoma, I figured it&#x27;s time to protect my skin, rather than fry it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say I was drawn to this product to test out not only how the color developed on my skin type (which is semi-fair to medium) but, also, for the convenience it portrays.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The new kind is similar to the Fake Bake spray you apply in the shower only.</li>
            <li> (though I can&#x27;t verify) all over, but since I have such few occasions to self tan, I think it would be worth it to spend the money on a professional spray tan in the future.</li>
            <li> And because I&#x27;m so white, and I don&#x27;t have any kind of base tan, what&#x27;s cool about SheerTan</li>
            <li> Over the years, I&#x27;ve used every type of sunless tanning product starting with that orangy Avon lotion in the early 1980s; I&#x27;ve utilized tanning booths and gave up after thirteen sessions and only a burn to show for it; and I&#x27;ve booth spray tanned and airbrush spray tanned with \\&quot;professionals\\&quot;, but how often do you want to shell out $50-$80 for four days of being tan?</li>
            <li> Highly recommend the wand to anyone who has spent a fortune on spray tanning!  </li>
            <li> I ordered it because the past few years, I have not been able to make it in the sun or to a tanning bed to get ANY color (we started a family)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Irish and pretty pale</li>
            <li> Also, in the 1 or 2 of the spots where I got lazy and didn&#x27;t apply the lotion (back of right ankle)</li>
            <li> My left leg ended up being VERY blotchy, but I noticed some blotchiness all over, though it was less pronounced.  </li>
            <li> The spray is definitely on the high end, you get just the average 4 times max, if that out of one bottle.</li>
            <li> They even sent me an e-mail before I recieved the product which told me exactly how to apply it, especially around the hard areas like feet and hands.  </li>
            <li> However this has happened to me pretty much every time I have fake tanned</li>
            <li> and I felt like I could see just a slight change, but really not too much going on.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> I wish I had done this to my feet as well, because my hands look fine, but the toenails/feet bottoms are a bit yellow and frightening.    </li>
            <li> I also find that certain random spots rub off much sooner than others, like a spot by my armpit or a spot on my leg.</li>
            <li> It got all over my clothes and didn&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
            <li> I woke up and was pleasantly surprised to find a slight tan.  </li>
            <li> I then dry my hands and spray the back of my hands and wrist area.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall this did not work for me, and I been using self tanners for 10 years, will go back to the fake bake spray (in the purple box) amazing product, not sure why I even looked elsewhere</li>
            <li> and I mean ONLY downside is that you must moisterize very well.  </li>
            <li> Out of just the verified purchase reviews, only 13% rated it a 3 star or below and one of those 3 was due to the fact that the directions didn&#x27;t come with the order, which is a CS issue rather than product issue since they never tried the actual product.</li>
            <li> so I ave spent hundreds if not thousands of dollars on all different products from the expensive ones to the cheap ones.</li>
            <li> The only thing that gave me away was that I missed the spot on my elbows and in between my fingers, so be really careful when you apply it that you don&#x27;t miss any spots.</li>
            <li> My favorite has been the Fake Bake products until now!  </li>
            <li> Overall I like SheerTan a lot, but I&#x60;m gonna also use other products,</li>
            <li> I must have several open bottles of self tanning that I never use because the application is SO long and messy.  </li>
            <li> let it dry for about a 1/2 hour, then went to bed.</li>
            <li> I have medium/olive skin that is kinda dry.</li>
            <li> so I know how to spread it evenly and let it dry and etc etc etc.</li>
            <li> It takes forever to dry.</li>
            <li> If I can pass along a tip, one thing I learned early on is that using a thick, emollient body lotion to apply the product only helps you \\&quot;rub</li>
            <li> Spray has very little if any smell and using bronzer helps ensure it&#x27;s even, though I know others who swear by the clear.</li>
            <li> So I am not sure why I was send the old one to begin with?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was a mess of blotchy orange and white.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent a zillion dollars on tanners and this product and the delivery system</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried home tanners (banana boat, Jergens daily tanning lotion) which work, but get streaky after a few days.</li>
            <li> or so I didn&#x27;t notice much difference in my color and was annoyed...</li>
            <li> there are 23 out of 35 verified purchase reviews, which is roughly 66%.</li>
            <li> or else you will look a little strange.  </li>
            <li> I did have one small patch of orange on my palm where I didn&#x27;t wash well enough</li>
            <li> It took a little while to dry, and even after I put clothes on, it was a bit sticky for awhile.</li>
            <li> And even with the wand, it is hard to reach the backs of the legs and the back, but I have done my best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I have only used the product on my face, arms and chest so far (why waste an expensive product on areas no one will see!?)I</li>
            <li> With shipping I spent $45 the biggest waste of money ever.</li>
            <li> it can come off on your sheets if you apply it and don&#x27;t shower before sleeping and 2) wear ankle socks when applying to your legs and then remove socks when applying lotion and just spread the lotion down to the feet to get tan feet.  </li>
            <li> (I use the bathroom with towels down to catch the spray).  </li>
            <li> No more walking around the house lke a sumo wrestler waiting for the tanner to dry evenly.</li>
            <li> My palms are a little discolored and so are my heals (i have beach feet, very rough</li>
            <li> Being a guy, I&#x27;m not very flexible and have a very hard time reaching my back.</li>
            <li> I wash it a few times a day, but other than that</li>
            <li> I had a slight line at my wrist bones</li>
            <li> I have been self-tanning for at least the past ten years and consider myself a pro!</li>
            <li> So I was a little nervous to try another tanning spray, because others I have tried ended up streaky</li>
            <li> It took a little getting used to, holding the wand that is, but after I got the hang of it, it was a breeze.</li>
            <li> Yes, your palms get a little orangey, even after washing.</li>
            <li> And be a little patient for it to develop.</li>
            <li> I decided to do a little math to show everyone the breakdown of just the Amazon verified purchase reviews.</li>
            <li> I have used other products in the past and did not have a problem, but this product leaks and you end up with uneven tan.</li>
            <li> I have gotten so used to tanners that go on uneven and smell</li>
            <li> The day I received the product, I exfoliated, dried off, and applied the spray.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product - spend your money on letting the professionals do the work for you.  </li>
            <li> As it started to fade, it faded unevenly and looked</li>
            <li> (The bottles were not cheap.)</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s less than $1 per application!</li>
            <li> The other thing I did was apply a thick, cream moisturizer to my palms and fingernails from the beginning.</li>
            <li> I mean, who wants to walk around sporting a botched fake tan?!</li>
            <li> The only reason I can see of any orange color is using the wrong moisturizer in combination with the spray.    </li>
            <li> so I was not sure about that one</li>
            <li> wand is useless unless you spray your back , and even then it puts it all at an aweward angle, you might as well just use the spray wihtout the wand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am also very pale with red hair, and this didn&#x27;t make me look fake at all.</li>
            <li> The tan doesn&#x27;t look fake at all, and it didn&#x27;t take long</li>
            <li> so it is hard to tell if it is even or not.  </li>
            <li> I know all the little tricks to these little guys - but this product just failed.</li>
            <li> so you can&#x27;t see where you are applying it until it deepens and it is too late.</li>
            <li> I applied a thick Neutrogena cream on bottom of my feet and hands, I used gloves, I did everything how I should</li>
            <li> This is unbelievable!  </li>
            <li> No funny smells either but need to be careful not to get on carpeting while spraying (whoops :( ).  </li>
            <li> and today I woke up with horrible stains on bottom of my feet and my hands and white patches on my back.</li>
            <li> and I had to hide underneath long sleeves for a week to hide the ugly orange they turned me.</li>
            <li> I was tired of listening to</li>
            <li> It is the worse tanning product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Well, this has been ONE OF the worst experiences I have had so far.      </li>
            <li> The reviewer who said that all the reviews are fake is wrong.</li>
            <li> I must admit that I was skeptical until I tried the product.  </li>
            <li> and it is expensive...</li>
            <li> is it doesn&#x27;t make me look orangy or fake.  </li>
            <li> I was rather skeptical about the product, but the wand caught my attention.  </li>
            <li> I scrubbed myself like crazy yesterday</li>
            <li> for the price I must say it was a disappointment.</li>
            <li> I do go spray tanning here and there, but it&#x27;s SO EXPENSIVE!</li>
            <li> It was very expensive</li>
            <li> I like that it didn&#x27;t have that yucky smell nearly as bad as the others I have tried.  </li>
            <li> But when I woke up in the morning to an ugly orange \\&quot;glow,\\</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s been especially tough trying to find sunless tanners that don&#x27;t streak -- and</li>
            <li> I hate spending time in the sun because I don&#x27;t want wrinkles or skin cancer.  </li>
            <li> I am very disappointed...</li>
            <li> This tanning spray is the worst I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> I hate traveling or needing a tan and having to find a location that I must then pay $50 for!</li>
            <li> I hate when my towels and bed is covered with brown stuff that rubs off!  </li>
            <li> and I got horrible results.</li>
            <li> Horrible tanning product.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> You better know what you are doing before using this.  I have used other products in the past and did not have a problem, but this product leaks and you end up with uneven tan.</li>
            <li> So I was a little nervous to try another tanning spray, because others I have tried ended up streaky and I had to hide underneath long sleeves for a week to hide the ugly orange they turned me. But this stuff is GREAT! The tan doesn&#x27;t look fake at all, and it didn&#x27;t take long and it was very easy to apply. I am also very pale with red hair, and this didn&#x27;t make me look fake at all. The only thing that gave me away was that I missed the spot on my elbows and in between my fingers, so be really careful when you apply it that you don&#x27;t miss any spots. Now that I have done it once I&#x27;m sure next time it will look flawless! The color is great but I did have to reapply it more often on my face because I wash my face twice a day (I have moderate acne and will break out if I don&#x27;t) But other than that this is a wonderful product. It has been four days since I applied it and it still looks great!</li>
            <li> I never write reviews buuuut... This stuff is awesome! I&#x27;m Irish and pretty pale so I used to tan all the time. Then I got worried about skin cancer so I just stopped going but I missed being tan sooo much. I always want to be tan so I ordered this... I&#x27;ve used different self tanners and this one is def the best!!</li>
            <li> I am very fair-skinned so it&#x27;s been especially tough trying to find sunless tanners that don&#x27;t streak -- and no lie, I&#x27;ve tried just about every sunless tanner product on the market -- from the drugstore tubes to the super-pricey bottles from the Nordstrom cosmetic counter. SheerTan is far and away the best thing I&#x27;ve ever used. In fact, I got a professional airbrush tan a year ago and the results I got with SheerTan are just as nice -- only for the price of one airbrush tan, you can buy this product and get multiple spray tans out of it -- all you need to buy after the starter kit are refills.  Lastly, (and this cannot be underestimated) their customer service is terrific (and no, I don&#x27;t work there). I had a question and they got back to me immediately with a comprehensive answer.  Love it and completely recommend it!</li>
            <li> I have used numerous self tanning products.  My favorite has been the Fake Bake products until now!  Sheer tan is wonderful.  The spray is light, does not stain your bathroom or clothes, has little smell and the wand makes application super easy.  The bottle of spray goes quick though!  I got about 5 full-body applications from 1 can.  I will be ordering more.  Follow the directions closely.  Be careful when spraying your feet, go very light or else you will look a little strange.  Overall, a wonderful product that I would recommend!!</li>
            <li> Every summer since I can remember, I&#x27;ve been self-conscious about my white legs - there was even taunting when I was in grade school, so my quest for the perfect self-tanning product to cover my porcelain pins began young. Over the years, I&#x27;ve used every type of sunless tanning product starting with that orangy Avon lotion in the early 1980s; I&#x27;ve utilized tanning booths and gave up after thirteen sessions and only a burn to show for it; and I&#x27;ve booth spray tanned and airbrush spray tanned with \\&quot;professionals\\&quot;, but how often do you want to shell out $50-$80 for four days of being tan? It gets really spendy, really fast.     And then I stumbled on SheerTan. I think the Gods of Sunless Tanning were smiling on me that day. SheerTan satisfied every qualification that I was looking for in a sunless tanner: it&#x27;s easy to apply, it lasts for three days before you need to shave your legs/exfoliate and reapply, and it gives me realistic colour. You also get MANY applications with SheerTan. Only using the product on my full legs, I get 15 applications out of one can. That&#x27;s less than $1 per application! To me, it would be a bargain at twice the price.    If I can pass along a tip, one thing I learned early on is that using a thick, emollient body lotion to apply the product only helps you \\&quot;rub it off\\&quot; instead of \\&quot;rubbing it in\\&quot;. I&#x27;m a fan of Bath &amp; BodyWorks&#x27; Coconut Lime Verbena Body Lotion (not Body Cream)- it smells like a Hawaiian vacation. Yummo!  [[ASIN:B001Q1RHA8 Bath &amp; Body Works Pleasures Coconut Lime Verbena Body Lotion, 8 fl. oz. (236 ml)]]    To wrap up this review, if you&#x27;re looking for a natural tan that&#x27;s affordable, easy to apply, gives consistent colour and will fool your friends, just buy SheerTan. You won&#x27;t be disappointed. I know I&#x27;m glad my quest for the perfect self tanning product is over.</li>
            <li> I bought this product b/c of all the great reviews which now I know are FAKE. This tanning spray is the worst I have ever tried. Ive been using tanning sprays for over 5 years now so I ave spent hundreds if not thousands of dollars on all different products from the expensive ones to the cheap ones. This product made me so orange and the formula is clear so you cant see where you applied it. The wand is a cheap piece of plastic. With shipping I spent $45 the biggest waste of money ever. I&#x27;m warning everyone on amazon that sees all the good reviews above me are fake.</li>
            <li> I have only used this twice, but so far I really like it! I love the sprayer because it can get all those nooks and cranies really well that I sometimes miss (like the middle of my back). As a mother of a three year old and three month old, I like how fast it is to apply too. I don&#x27;t have time to spend 10-15 minutes putting on self tanner, making sure that I applied it all over evenly while there is a three year old running around. I also like that it dries fairly quickly. No more walking around the house lke a sumo wrestler waiting for the tanner to dry evenly. The color is pretty good too. I will definately buy more of the tanner, and I have already told my mom and sister about this!</li>
            <li> There are gobs of spray tans in the stores today so it&#x27;s a job just to try them all.  I have tried many including this one and I have to say, this is the one for me.  The wand is easy, it dries super quick and with the appliction instructions, the color turns out perfect every time.  The only reason I can see of any orange color is using the wrong moisturizer in combination with the spray.    Many of the ones I have used in the past have streaked and I just couldn&#x27;t get them even.  This one is the best do-it-yourself tanning spray I&#x27;ve tried in a long time.  I don&#x27;t like it but I need to cut back so with sheer tan cost savings (because I used to go to Mystic) I derive a certain pleasure from doing it myself and feel like it&#x27;s just the right thing for me.    Forever a Fan of SheerTan!</li>
            <li> I am a strawberry blonde with fair skin. I&#x27;m always looking for the latest and greatest self tanning product.  The wand is interesting, but actually, I haven&#x27;t used it yet.  The spray itself smells better than any I&#x27;ve ever used before. It also emits a very fine mist, which I like a lot.  The problem is that you can&#x27;t see where it&#x27;s being applied on your body, which causes me to have areas of darker orange where the product \\&quot;pooled\\&quot;.  In general, i think this product gives you a tan that is more orange than brown.  I think the Body Drench&#x27;s Quick Tan is a far superior product. It provides a much more natural looking tan.</li>
            <li> I have to get the technique a tad better, but overall very easy to use. I didn&#x27;t want to use self tanner because I could not reach my back... Now no problem. Spray has very little if any smell and using bronzer helps ensure it&#x27;s even, though I know others who swear by the clear. Read easy to follow directions first....  Enjoy! I am ordering more spray and am a happy customer :)</li>
            <li> I bought this item and it works like a charm! The tanning spray is wonderful. The light mist goes on easier than the grocery-store tanners and the wand, though it takes a little getting used to, gets those hard-to-reach places. The reviewer who said that all the reviews are fake is wrong. This isn&#x27;t brain surgery! Just follow the directions and you&#x27;ll have a fantastic tan in about 8 hours. What I like best is that you don&#x27;t have to use the wand all over, just for those places that are difficult to get to. If you want just a touch-up on your legs, you can just use the sprayer. Also, the smell is fragrant and doesn&#x27;t make you smell like you&#x27;ve just been out jogging, like some tanners do.</li>
            <li> This product works, you just have to be sure you wear latex gloves and apply lotion right after you apply the spray. It is definitely something you can do on your own. It might take a little practice but what I did was apply a light layer the first time and then as I got better I darkened the color! I wanted to be sure I followed the application rules correctly the first time, so I only used a little spray, but I noticed a definite difference! I&#x27;ve been using spray tan booths and airbrush tans for some time and this is so much better because 1) it&#x27;s cheaper and 2) it&#x27;s mobile. I hate traveling or needing a tan and having to find a location that I must then pay $50 for! It&#x27;s so easy to pop this in your bag and travel with it so you can apply it yourself anywhere! The gloves are key- I used aveeno moisturizing lotion during the application and after to maintain the color.</li>
            <li> Thank you!  I&#x27;ve spent a zillion dollars on tanners and this product and the delivery system really works!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t tan a lot but saw this and thought it was a cool idea. I wanted to get rid of some of my winter white skin because it makes me feel better to have some color.  I was ready for that extra lift a tan can give.    I was pleasantly surprised that it was a very easy to use sprayer (not flimsy like I thought it would be) and the tan looks really good.  I&#x27;m so white I did do 2 coats but it is lookin&#x27; good!  If you want to feel more like spring, buy this, it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> This is a must buy for anyone who knows the pain of trying to use self tanners by yourself.  I found the product to be nicely made, easy to use and handle.  I was so overjoyed when I discovered not only was it easy to use but it did a fantastic job.  I have gotten so used to tanners that go on uneven and smell I WAS SO AMAZED when I found this goes on lightly and it doesn&#x27;t have a strong odor.  Be sure to use the lotion after as the directions indicate.  So happy I found this product, I would definetly recommend it.  Not only is it a time saver but it saves me money from having to head to the tanning booth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll make this short &amp; sweet.  I&#x27;ve tried them all (home &amp; salon) and this is the best by far.  Light, easy, barely smells.  Try it and you&#x27;ll be thrilled!  Two things I learned:  1) it can come off on your sheets if you apply it and don&#x27;t shower before sleeping and 2) wear ankle socks when applying to your legs and then remove socks when applying lotion and just spread the lotion down to the feet to get tan feet.  I&#x27;ve already ordered the 6-pack refill!</li>
            <li> The Sheer Tan Sunless Tanning Wand is an awesome invention!     Back in the day (HS), I went tanning about 2 times a week. I&#x27;m a natural blonde, and now that my brother had melanoma, I figured it&#x27;s time to protect my skin, rather than fry it! I do go spray tanning here and there, but it&#x27;s SO EXPENSIVE! I&#x27;ve tried home tanners (banana boat, Jergens daily tanning lotion) which work, but get streaky after a few days. After looking at reviews, I decided to try the sheer tan wand.   The day I received the product, I exfoliated, dried off, and applied the spray. It took a little getting used to, holding the wand that is, but after I got the hang of it, it was a breeze. I put on some light Victoria&#x27;s secret lotion (it says to do that in the directions)I let it dry for about a 1/2 hour, then went to bed. Woke up in the morning with a nice color! I did notice that I missed a place on my back, so be sure to look in the mirror when applying it the back! I&#x27;ve had to re-apply to my face b/c I wash it a few times a day, but other than that, it&#x27;s lasted longer than I thought. (*When applying to your face, spray it in your hands then rub on your face. If you have blonde hair like me, it can become orange&#x27;ish if you don&#x27;t block the overspray. )</li>
            <li> This is unbelievable!  After being in the sailing charter business for many years, my sun exposure caught up with me, and I knew I had to arrive at an alternate plan.  Sheer Tan seemed to be the most appealing---and this product is A+!  It is comparably inexpensive, can easily be self-applied in a very short time, and creates a no-streak golden tan!  And the best of all---no harm to the skin no matter how many applications!  I LOVE this!!  Hats off to the girl who developed this and anyone else who participated.  This is my answer!  THANK YOU!</li>
            <li> *** UPDATED on 4/11/12&lt;br /&gt;After using this several times, I would rate it 3 stars (I originally rated it 4). As another reviewer mentioned, this seems to wash off the face and neck much faster than the rest of the body. I also find that certain random spots rub off much sooner than others, like a spot by my armpit or a spot on my leg. This shouldn&#x27;t happen if you exfoliate properly before application, which I have. And even with the wand, it is hard to reach the backs of the legs and the back, but I have done my best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found the best way to apply is to wear gloves, spray the body, then rub in the moisturizer all over (it says only use on knobby areas of arms and legs but I have been getting splotches elswhere so I have been using it on the whole leg, whole arm, etc). AFTER you rub in all the moisturizer, then take off the gloves and spray your hands lightly. This will avoid the orange palms. But be sure to not wash your hands or get them wet for hours - I found that out when I attempted to wash dishes 2 hours after application and woke up the next day with a tan arm and white hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, in summary, I will still use this product because it is reasonably priced, easy to use once a little trial and error is done, and gets me tan without using the sun, a tanning bed, or a $50 per session spray tan. But I took off one star because of the quick fading of the face/neck area, and one star because this doesnt have a built in bronzer so you can&#x27;t see where you are applying it until it deepens and it is too late. I will just have to apply more often to my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;_______________________________________________&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this after reading the reviews here. Quite honestly, I wasn&#x27;t sure if all the reviews were actually real but I decided to give it a try. After all, I spend close to $50 on ONE spray tan session that lasts maybe 5 days, so to me it was worth shelling out $50 for this product if it does what it says. Please note that Ihave not yet tried the wand applicator. It is winter and I have only used the product on my face, arms and chest so far (why waste an expensive product on areas no one will see!?)I will update my review when I use the wand but for now I am just reviewing the actual tanner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this tanner to be very effective and the results were the equivalent to what I get with a spray tan in a salon, although it does not come out as dark. The color of the tanner came out looking very natural, not orange at all. I have medium/olive skin that is kinda dry. I do tan easily in the summer. Maybe that is why I had better results than others with fairer skin. The smell is ok but as it develops the inevitable tanning smell appears, which is fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with exact instructions, which I followed. I took a shower and exfoliated. Then I put my hair in a shower cap and pulled it to the scalp line. I put the lotion on the palms of my hands (not feet b/c I didn&#x27;t spray my legs) to act as a barrier, and then sprayed my face, chest, neck and arms. I did several coats, not knowing how dark or light it would be when it develops - there is no color when you spray it so it is hard to tell if it is even or not.  I immediately rubbed moisturizers on the arms as directed by the instructions to make sure the knobby parts of your body come out evenly. I had a slight line at my wrist bones if you looked closely you could see that it was spray tanned, but I&#x27;m ok with that. Yes, your palms get a little orangey, even after washing. However this has happened to me pretty much every time I have fake tanned so I expect it and don&#x27;t fault the maker for it. Next time I will wear gloves when I apply and moisturize, then remove them and spray my hands. It took a little while to dry, and even after I put clothes on, it was a bit sticky for awhile. After two hours or so I didn&#x27;t notice much difference in my color and was annoyed...But by the morning I had a nice glow and it was obvious that I was tanner. I did another application two days later to darken the color. After the second application, the tan lasted about 5 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this 4 stars because I think the tanner should have an immediate bronzer so you can see what you are doing when you apply. But I am happy with the product so far and plan on continuing to use it. And I will update this review after I use the wand in the warmer months.</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift from a friend.  I am extremely fair and avoid the sun at all costs (cover ups and sunscreen) due to burning and freckling and of course the long term effects of wrinkling and skin cancer.  I do prefer the look of tanned skin, especially in the summer.  I must admit that I was skeptical until I tried the product.  I was very careful to spray lightly and evenly.  This product smelled fine.  I applied the lotion and then went to bed.  I woke up and was pleasantly surprised to find a slight tan.  I did have one small patch of orange on my palm where I didn&#x27;t wash well enough but obviously that&#x27;s my error and not the fault of the product.  Overall a great product which I will recommend to friends.</li>
            <li> A couple months ago I went to a salon and paid for a spray tan.  It was very expensive and I wasn&#x27;t very satisfied with the results.  It got all over my clothes and didn&#x27;t last very long.  Afterward, I started searching for an alternative at home spray tan that was a reasonable price.  I looked on Amazon at the reviews of multiple different items.  I ended up buying SheerTan because it had the highest rating from customers.  I was very happy with my purchase.  It sprays very light so you don&#x27;t get runs and have to worry about streaking.  It was very simple to apply.  They even sent me an e-mail before I recieved the product which told me exactly how to apply it, especially around the hard areas like feet and hands.  It dried very quickly and did not get all over my clothes.  It doesn&#x27;t even feel like there is anything on my skin, it isn&#x27;t sticky or anything.  I am extremely satisfied with my purchased and will continue to use it!!  Thanks SheerTan!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been tanning for years and have tried most everything so I feel like I can critique anything that involves sunless tans. I loved this one!     It really works wonderful for reaching the back part of the body. I have always had a problem twisting the cans to try to get coverage to those places.  It doesn&#x27;t fog up the area where I spray (I use the bathroom with towels down to catch the spray).  I like that it didn&#x27;t have that yucky smell nearly as bad as the others I have tried.  The wand is pretty high quality and thick but light and I love that it folds up.    I also like that it doesn&#x27;t have bronzer in it. I hate when my towels and bed is covered with brown stuff that rubs off!  This is a new thing I&#x27;ve not heard of to put on moisturizer on right after you spray so I was not sure about that one but it does great in covering any possibility of skips and runs (yep, I&#x27;ve had those too). There is nothing much you can really do about the runs if you leave them to turn brown so this technique proved to eliminate that.    Overall, I really like the wand and give the spray an A so I&#x27;m giving it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic Product!  I ordered it because the past few years, I have not been able to make it in the sun or to a tanning bed to get ANY color (we started a family) So I had tried Clinique when I was pregnant and could not tolerate the smell of it and I love their products.  I was tired of listening to my hubby tell me I needed color and started looking at it and thought I would give it a try!  It ROCKS!!  So easy to apply and I went to bed Friday Night and woke up Saturday morning looking as if I just stepped off the beach!  My hubby loves it!  The only and I mean ONLY downside is that you must moisterize very well.  My palms are a little discolored and so are my heals (i have beach feet, very rough and so I should have avoided application on the bottom of my heals anyway)  But the color is perfect and after this first application of learning the ropes i think I will know better what to do better.  I will be placing an order for more cans tonight!  Thanks Sheertan!</li>
            <li> I opened my box and I had no directions so I haven&#x27;t been able to use it yet....hopefully I get an email soon I would love to use this product</li>
            <li> I have tried everything on the market from FakeBake, St.Tropaz, jergens, copperton, xentan, you name it! I put this on and did NOT think it would work. It took hours to develop (as the directions said) but then BOOM...I get this natural looking tan. I am 43 and my husband said I look 25 WOW! It really gets every area you need to get and without the embarrassment of having to have someone see you bare! If you want a super dark tan, then one application will not do it. But if you want an even, natural looking tan, this is it!!! Make sure to apply the lotion afterwards, and do it with good ventilation. I wore a mask because the fumes were a little strong. Excellent product!!!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I knew it has to be too good to be true. I bought the product because of all the great reviews it has. I used it for the first time yesterday evening and today I woke up with horrible stains on bottom of my feet and my hands and white patches on my back. I scrubbed myself like crazy yesterday I applied a thick Neutrogena cream on bottom of my feet and hands, I used gloves, I did everything how I should and I got horrible results. I got better results with Jergens gradual tanning lotion than with this and it is expensive... I have to now get some way to remove those unwanted streaks... I am very disappointed...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 5.4.2012&lt;br /&gt;Seller if very professional and courteous, she refunded my money and gave me some nice tips on how to apply the tan. I will try them and update my review soon. I am changing my rating to 4 stars because I am impressed with the customer service that I received.</li>
            <li> I tan a lot so a good tanner is important to me. Being a guy, I&#x27;m not very flexible and have a very hard time reaching my back. Thanks for this great product! It has good overall color with an airbrush quality soft spray.  If you prep your skin properly, it works very well.  I spray on Friday&#x27;s and reapply mid-week to keep a constant tan. If just makes me feel I look healthy and have been given several compliments on my tan even from my son, who is very picky.    I used to use a carwash pad with the lotions for my back so the wand invention is terrific.  I can reach all parts easily.  The spray dries pretty fast but leaves that clamy feeling like all the other so just have to endure the time it takes to go away. It has a nice smell and I loved the results and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I use selftan all the time and this time I was attracted by the wand. It&#x60;s really useful, I can finally apply selftan to my back without help or doing gymnastics. Here&#x60;s what I like:  - the wand is awesome and easy to use,  - the spray is great; very light and clear,  - tan came out even and really natural (for more dramatic results I can reapply the next day), last long and fades gradually,  - the fragrance is not overpowering, although next day in the morning I recognized this specific selftan smell (not strong, it&#x60;s shower time anyway).  One can last about 4 full body applications.  When I compare the whole experience to mystic tan SheerTan wins-it doesn&#x60;t smell, leaves clothes clean, not expensive, I don&#x60;t have to drive to tan salon.   For airplane travelling, when I take carry on only I love Tan Towel Toweletts, another winner! For beautiful glow and instant results I love Lancome self bronzer Medium Colour Oil-Free Tinted Self-Tanning Lotion for Face (all Lancomes selftan products are great). For one application dark color, no strikes and smooth skin I adore L&#x27;Oreal Sublime Bronze Self-Tanning Gel Medium-Deep. Those my top products after few years of trying and searching.  Overall I like SheerTan a lot, but I&#x60;m gonna also use other products, depends what results I need, how much time I have etc.</li>
            <li> I hate spending time in the sun because I don&#x27;t want wrinkles or skin cancer.  My friends make fun of me because I&#x27;m so white.  Truly, because of the wand, I&#x27;m able to reach down my back which is so great cuz I don&#x27;t need help from anyone, and with the evenness of the spray, getting a tan is super easy.  I really love it.  And because I&#x27;m so white, and I don&#x27;t have any kind of base tan, what&#x27;s cool about SheerTan is it doesn&#x27;t make me look orangy or fake.  It really looks like I have a nice glow.  I&#x27;m so excited by this product that I already bought it for my sister as a gift for the summer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Irish/Scottish, so I&#x27;ve had plenty of experiences with self tanners; some good, some not so good.  Well, this has been ONE OF the worst experiences I have had so far.      The product itself seemed great: it smelled nice, and the fine-mist spray was super cool.  I used the directions exactly as stated. But when I woke up in the morning to an ugly orange \\&quot;glow,\\&quot; I was soooo dissapointed! I&#x27;ve honestly had better results with store bought self tanning lotions (seriously!).    I thought I was in good hands, given all the great reviews for this product - but now I am doubting if they are even real.    Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product - spend your money on letting the professionals do the work for you.  I mean, who wants to walk around sporting a botched fake tan?! It was pretty embarassing when I had to put my swim suit on and get in the water. I was a mess of blotchy orange and white. And yes, I did use the product correctly. I&#x27;ve used these types of products before - so I know how to spread it evenly and let it dry and etc etc etc. I know all the little tricks to these little guys - but this product just failed.</li>
            <li> Let me say that I put the first layer on somewhat cautiously, and followed their instructions. I waited about 5 hours and I felt like I could see just a slight change, but really not too much going on. I decided to apply a second coat and hope that it would do something.    Next morning... wow was I tan. In retrospect, I wish I had waited out the night for the first coat, because I think it would have looked amazing and not too \\&quot;wow you&#x27;re suddenly dark.\\&quot;  Also, in the 1 or 2 of the spots where I got lazy and didn&#x27;t apply the lotion (back of right ankle) I can see the streakiness but everywhere else looks really amazing.    The other thing I did was apply a thick, cream moisturizer to my palms and fingernails from the beginning. I wish I had done this to my feet as well, because my hands look fine, but the toenails/feet bottoms are a bit yellow and frightening.    So, bottom line, follow the instructions because they are really good. And be a little patient for it to develop.</li>
            <li> As someone in the reviews mentioned there are a lot of reviewers who aren&#x27;t verified to have purchased the product. I decided to do a little math to show everyone the breakdown of just the Amazon verified purchase reviews. I also plan to purchase this product myself and will add my personal review after trying a while. For now, I gave it a 5 star so as not to affect the majority score.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As of today 9/21/12 there are 23 out of 35 verified purchase reviews, which is roughly 66%. Out of just the verified purchase reviews, only 13% rated it a 3 star or below and one of those 3 was due to the fact that the directions didn&#x27;t come with the order, which is a CS issue rather than product issue since they never tried the actual product. The remaining 20 reviews or 87% rated a 4 star or higher. There was a total of 74% of verified users who rated this a 5 star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps everyone put some perspective on the ratings. Also wanted to mention the non verified purchase reviews shouldn&#x27;t be totally discredited either. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend the wand to anyone who has spent a fortune on spray tanning!  This product pays for itself immediately.  Very user friendly, I would&#x27;ve never believed that I could do this myself!</li>
            <li> Thank you so much for getting this to me so fast! I haven&#x27;t tried it yet but with the instructions you provided, I know it will be a success in making me look tan. And the wand will make it so much easier to apply to areas normally unreachable.</li>
            <li> This is the best self tanner around. Not orange, doesn&#x27;t rub off on clothes.  Fairly easy to apply.  Must use a compatible lotion to keep it moist.  If they sell one (from this company) buy it so they work well together.  I&#x27;ve tried sunless tanning at the salons and used other at home products (even the more expensive types) and NONE work as well, look as good or last as long.  This is the ONLY one that gives instant color and developing color but DOES NOT transfer onto clothing from my skin.  I highly recommend.  No funny smells either but need to be careful not to get on carpeting while spraying (whoops :( ).  Try it, you will LOVE it!</li>
            <li> I have tried everything on ty he market-starting about 13 years ago. This is by far the best product. Easy to apply, does not turn you orange, and smell is not unbearable. Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have been self-tanning for at least the past ten years and consider myself a pro! From creams to foams to sprays I have perfected whichever type I purchase. I&#x27;d say I was drawn to this product to test out not only how the color developed on my skin type (which is semi-fair to medium) but, also, for the convenience it portrays. In my opinion, if I were a beginner at self-tanning I would continue to purchase the refills.The color was very nice and developed well and had no bad odor at all. If you have been self-tanning yourself for a while and have a knack at the application of the products you use then this Tanning Wand may not knock your socks off.....if you are a self-tanning newbie....I say buy it and try and you&#x27;ll probably like it! I would say the directions we not all that clear so do some more research online on the application process if you get that &amp;#34;what am I supposed to do&amp;#34; feeling when reading the instructions that come with the kit. Happy Safe Tanning!!!!</li>
            <li> The can had just about 2 applications in it, and I decided to apply them the 2 days before I went on vacation.  It was kind of hard to know you were applying evenly because it goes on clear.  I did like the wand; it made application much easier.  I unfortunately got caught in the rain that night, and was able to protect all but my left leg.  My left leg ended up being VERY blotchy, but I noticed some blotchiness all over, though it was less pronounced.  My face and arms looked good.  It gathered on my hands (even though I had wiped them off afterwards) and turned them very orange.  As it started to fade, it faded unevenly and looked very spotty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that maybe with practice it&#x27;s possible to make this look good (though I can&#x27;t verify) all over, but since I have such few occasions to self tan, I think it would be worth it to spend the money on a professional spray tan in the future.</li>
            <li> The wand is pretty nifty. I really like to use it on my face. I tried to do my whole body but won&#x27;t be trying that again.&lt;br /&gt;I will be ordering more of the product, it&#x27;s not sticky and as self tanners go, it not too stinky either.</li>
            <li> Horrible tanning product. Streaky, cake feet. Followed directions and have used more than once to make sure it was consistent. It is the worse tanning product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I thought it was going to be great like everyone said. Haha what a joke. my clothing changed orange. It didn&#x27;t last long. It takes forever to dry. It never truned out that perfect tan. I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> I must have several open bottles of self tanning that I never use because the application is SO long and messy.  (The bottles were not cheap.) The SheerTan Sunless System is very easy, especially using the Wand.  I takes me about 5 minutes to spray, and then another 5 minutes to apply body moisturizer.  I&#x27;m so glad I took the leap and tried this system.  Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> This was an okay item very cheap and every spray I put in there leaked badly waste of product</li>
            <li> I was rather skeptical about the product, but the wand caught my attention.  It was super easy to apply, but be sure to use lotion rub it in right after you apply.  For my hands, I&#x27;ve found that washing my hands after rubbing lotion over the tanned areas is good for removing the excess self tanner from them.  I then dry my hands and spray the back of my hands and wrist area.  I then rub my wrist together to blend it.  I use it after every shower and I am able to keep up the tan.  So much safer than tanning beds and much easier than driving to a salon or having someone come to my house.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> for the price I must say it was a disappointment. The spray is definitely on the high end, you get just the average 4 times max, if that out of one bottle. The nozzle sprays inconcistently, you end up with some blotches.&lt;br /&gt;My first bottle was broken, the seller was really nice, she send a replacement product. but with that also was, oh we have a NEW version of it. The bottle looked the same etc. So I am not sure why I was send the old one to begin with?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new kind is similar to the Fake Bake spray you apply in the shower only. Wow super messy!&lt;br /&gt;The wand is useless unless you spray your back , and even then it puts it all at an aweward angle, you might as well just use the spray wihtout the wand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also if you think of using any other kind of spray with the wand, unless the size fits and it is an aerosol spray can , it won&#x27;t work&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this did not work for me, and I been using self tanners for 10 years, will go back to the fake bake spray (in the purple box) amazing product, not sure why I even looked elsewhere</li>
