            <li>H2ocean is great.</li>
            <li>This stuff works great for my tattoos.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Finally, this product is great for healed tattoos also.</li>
            <li>This product is great.</li>
            <li>The colors in my tat look amazing!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure that it can be categorized as one of the best things I have done for him, since he was using Vaseline ew!</li>
            <li>I am amazed and delighted to say that it has gone away</li>
            <li>and he used it and loved it.    </li>
            <li>product does a good job in the healing process of tattoo.</li>
            <li>you love your tattoos, do yourself a favor and use this!</li>
            <li>pump top is perfect and stays clean and sanitary</li>
            <li>the work that I&#x27;ve used this product on has healed wonderfully and very vibrant.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for about 6 months and it is amazing.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>, I put this product on and my ink looks amazing and fresh.&lt;br</li>
            <li>While working, when I said how much I liked both products, the artist mentioned that one of her customers swears by the foam for eczema.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li>It has an incredible touch to healing your skin after some awesome ink, which feels like your own skin and no nonsense ointment mess!</li>
            <li>It rubs in very easily and I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m going to lift any scabs or damage the tattoo in any way.</li>
            <li>i heal fine because ive got good skin</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best first aid foam out there,  easy to apply,  dries fast and great for the skin with Kelp in it.  </li>
            <li>but thats ok</li>
            <li>I have several tattoo&#x27;s  and again this is the best.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s WAY better than the stuff I used before.</li>
            <li>I say this with conviction because I love tattoo&#x27;s</li>
            <li>so it won&#x27;t actually protect your tattoos from the sun, but you can use it when you want your tattoos to look their best.</li>
            <li>I love it, it&#x27;s really smooth on my skin!</li>
            <li>Fast healing time and great application.</li>
            <li>Smells good, very soothing, and you don&#x27;t have to rub it in like the lotion.</li>
            <li>But my tats took forever to heal and they never scabbed over very quickly.</li>
            <li>This stuff was so moisturizing and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Now I use it for general first aid, and it is also great for that!</li>
            <li>I did recently have a lovely tat done and used this product happily.</li>
            <li>it goes on easily without being oily or sticky.  </li>
            <li>Its fine to use in the shower too.</li>
            <li>if you go a head and buy all three the foam soap and the foam aftercare and lotion its like 25 bucks and the box with all three in it comes via amazon and free reg shipping...</li>
            <li>(I am NOT a medical profession and this is word of mouth from a happy customer</li>
            <li>Used a few and this is the best out there.</li>
            <li>This stuff isn&#x27;t just aftercare for tattoos,  I use it for a variety of first aid purposes to keep my skin healthy.  </li>
            <li>The H2ocean foam has worked amazingly well on my most recent tattoo.</li>
            <li>It has kind of a slippery feel at first, but once it rubs it, you don&#x27;t really notice it.</li>
            <li>It was very soothing to my tattoo, and I enjoyed the usage.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t bother me though as the smell fades quickly.</li>
            <li>Even my artist comments on how bold everything has healed.</li>
            <li>You dont need very much also!</li>
            <li>My tattoo VERY rarely itches and there is no weird bumpy scabbing just peels and flakes.</li>
            <li>so take it for what it&#x27;s worth)    </li>
            <li>Ordering a few more now as I can&#x27;t keep my own bottle; my family keeps stealing them.</li>
            <li>It was well worth it.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve gotten about 13 hours worth of tattoo work done since then, using this foam for each tattoo.</li>
            <li>It made my tattoo heal very quickly and the scabs formed quickly and sloughed off naturally.</li>
            <li>This product is to be used right after the bandage is  taken off and the tattoo cleaned.  </li>
            <li>This product has always done right by me.</li>
            <li>It moisturizes just the right amount.</li>
            <li>Easy to use anywhere and can&#x27;t do better with any other product.</li>
            <li>The rash would go away, but come back a few days after I stopped using the best of the products.      </li>
            <li>The can probably has two more tattoos worth of product left in it</li>
            <li>My first tattoo, which I treated with A&amp;D followed by unscented Lubriderm, took almost 3 weeks to finish scabbing and flaking off.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty dedicated/obsessive/militant/committed to tattoo aftercare.</li>
            <li>I kept putting off getting more over and over and just stuck to the regular lotion I use</li>
            <li>and I can absolutely see the difference already!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad it doesn&#x27;t have an actual added fragrance to it</li>
            <li>I got my first tattoo,cross, a week ago</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t see why so many people say not to peel, aside from if its just starting too and your peeling skin still on you.</li>
            <li>My tattoo did not heal right and is faded in certain areas.  </li>
            <li>i itch just from the tatt wax that&#x27;s supposed to be all natural!!!!</li>
            <li>I actually looked forward to applying it to my scab because it really made it feel better.  </li>
            <li>Regular moisturizing is important but this stuff just seems to really bring out the colors.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>My tattoos absolutely pop when I use this consistently.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and it works wonders during that time, but you really have to rub it into the skin for it to absorb.</li>
            <li>(I actually was using the cream, but my son, who went with me to have a birthday present tat done liked this foam)    </li>
            <li>I also have a pretty strict regimen of lotions, creams and products I use to keep my tattoos looking brand new.</li>
            <li>Another thing I like about it it that it doesn&#x27;t feel oily like most other Tattoo Gunks.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve used mainly tatt wax and a and d ointment both of which were really really itchy to my skin...</li>
            <li>and btw you can use this on your older tattoos as well</li>
            <li>quick fyi don&#x27;t buy these individually...</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this for tattoo aftercare.</li>
            <li>I finally got a fresh supply of this about a week ago</li>
            <li>i always use h2 ocean tattoo aftercare when i get new ink work done.  </li>
            <li>went about the last month without using any because I ran out and life was pretty hectic.</li>
            <li>i have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li>This product really locks in the ink especially if your tattoo&#x27;s have color.</li>
            <li>It really helps with minor scratches and scrapes, or that one stubborn piercing that just won&#x27;t stop being irritated.</li>
            <li>I have several, but I just started a new piece</li>
            <li>Has a bit of a funny smell to it, but for what it does for your tattoo, the smell is just a minor set back.</li>
            <li>My original aftercare was the usual unscented soap, lubriderm, you know the drill.</li>

            <li> My original aftercare was the usual unscented soap, lubriderm, you know the drill.</li>
            <li> My new tattoo which is the same size healed in less than a week and with almost no color fading.</li>
            <li> this is NOT I reapeat NOT petroleum based which means vibrant healing with little to no fading at all...</li>
            <li> /&gt;You really only need about a quarter sized amount to cover a decent sized tattoo and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> use Aquaphor during the initial healing phase where the tattoo is still a little sore and hasn&#x27;t quite developed scabs/a flaking layer yet</li>
            <li> Beware though it STINGS like crazy, but as I said it is worth it because it heals your tattoo&#x27;s really fast.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The can I received looks different than the image shown on the listing so if you get a can that is mostly black with a blue logo, don&#x27;t worry about it being different because it is simply an aesthetic</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a little more difficult to rub in the Aquaphor all the way when the tattoo is starting to peel.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s harder on tattoo color.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent a lot of money on them and am committed to taking care of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll be repurchasing once it&#x27;s empty.</li>
            <li> a lot of people say that the foam burns but getting the tattoo in the first place is a lot worse!  </li>
            <li> The price might seem a bit steep for such a small can, but it</li>
            <li> Unlike other tattoo care products, it doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling sticky or greasy.</li>
            <li> I have several tattoos and in the past I always used aquaphore.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for something for that awkward state that tattoos enter when they&#x27;re not quite healed yet not super fresh and</li>
            <li> It does sting a little</li>
            <li> It has a little bit of a sea salt smell to it which might bother some people.</li>
            <li> Kept tattoo moisturized, but faded it in the heavy inking areas.</li>
            <li> Never had this trouble while using Tattoo Goo.</li>
            <li> and i dont see any missing ink.</li>
            <li> It creates a weird flaky thing that&#x27;s almost like a scab for me..</li>
            <li> but it makes the healing process annoying slapping instead of scratching or icing...</li>
            <li> I had been having a miserable time with a rash that would not go away (in an area where clothing elastic/wire exacerbated it.</li>
            <li> It is not oily, greasy, disgusting smelling, doesn&#x27;t give a burning/itching sensation.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The H2ocean foam has worked amazingly well on my most recent tattoo. My first tattoo, which I treated with A&amp;D followed by unscented Lubriderm, took almost 3 weeks to finish scabbing and flaking off. My new tattoo which is the same size healed in less than a week and with almost no color fading. The A&amp;D is part petroleum so it&#x27;s harder on tattoo color. H2ocean is great. It does sting a little but it protects tattoos so well.</li>
            <li> ok... i am a bit obsessed with tattoos and i have been getting them for over 10 years now...i&#x27;ve used mainly tatt wax and a and d ointment both of which were really really itchy to my skin...i heal fine because ive got good skin but it makes the healing process annoying slapping instead of scratching or icing...if your into your tatts you know what im talking about...about the h20... this is NOT I reapeat NOT petroleum based which means vibrant healing with little to no fading at all... i wish i knew about this stuff for some of my color work that ive had done but thats ok because once i get them re worked i will be using this stuff for life...and btw you can use this on your older tattoos as well and you can also use the lotion it comes with on a daily basis for your daily moisturizer... no petroleum means no sticky tacky goo no grease stains on your clothes and your tattoo heals a lot quicker because it can breathe...not to worry it does include all of the anti bacterial stuff you need for a no infection hassle...quick fyi don&#x27;t buy these individually...if you go a head and buy all three the foam soap and the foam aftercare and lotion its like 25 bucks and the box with all three in it comes via amazon and free reg shipping...and you don&#x27;t need a lot if you are only using it for healing purposes....a lot of people say that the foam burns but getting the tattoo in the first place is a lot worse!  it tingles it doesn&#x27;t burn...and trust me i have really sensitive skin i itch just from the tatt wax that&#x27;s supposed to be all natural!!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome! My boyfriend used it on his tats before he and I met and he suggested I use it on mine. I have several, but I just started a new piece and I needed some aftercare. My original aftercare was the usual unscented soap, lubriderm, you know the drill. But my tats took forever to heal and they never scabbed over very quickly. This stuff was so moisturizing and easy to apply. It made my tattoo heal very quickly and the scabs formed quickly and sloughed off naturally. The colors in my tat look amazing! This stuff is going to last me forever because I just used it on a big side piece and I still have lots left! Definitely buy this stuff if you have a tattoo or plan on getting one!</li>
            <li> I used this for nipple piercing aftercare. In fact, it&#x27;s all I used, and they healed perfectly. Now I use it for general first aid, and it is also great for that! It really helps with minor scratches and scrapes, or that one stubborn piercing that just won&#x27;t stop being irritated. It basically mimics human tears in terms of antimicrobial properties.</li>
            <li> I did recently have a lovely tat done and used this product happily. (I actually was using the cream, but my son, who went with me to have a birthday present tat done liked this foam)    While working, when I said how much I liked both products, the artist mentioned that one of her customers swears by the foam for eczema. I had been having a miserable time with a rash that would not go away (in an area where clothing elastic/wire exacerbated it. I went to the dermatologist and got lotion and cream and product after product (some which were ONLY supposed to be used for 21 days they were so loaded with steroids.  The rash would go away, but come back a few days after I stopped using the best of the products.      So, I thought, I might as well use the excess from my tat for the rash. I am amazed and delighted to say that it has gone away and I used this now once or twice a week and it STAYS away!    My husband had been having similar problems in another area (heat related?) and he used it and loved it.    Well, why not? It is antibacterial and anti-fungal; seems to me it might well work for a lot of things!     (I am NOT a medical profession and this is word of mouth from a happy customer so take it for what it&#x27;s worth)    Ordering a few more now as I can&#x27;t keep my own bottle; my family keeps stealing them.</li>
            <li> This is some GOOD STUFF! It has healed my tattoos faster than the ones I used Tattoo Goo on or another type of Tattoo Stuff on. It creates a weird flaky thing that&#x27;s almost like a scab for me.. I found it&#x27;s best to ignore it even if it looks nasssty! It will fall off on it&#x27;s own. Beware though it STINGS like crazy, but as I said it is worth it because it heals your tattoo&#x27;s really fast. Another thing I like about it it that it doesn&#x27;t feel oily like most other Tattoo Gunks. Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> H2ocean foam is the best aftercare tattoo I have used.  This product is to be used right after the bandage is  taken off and the tattoo cleaned.  I have several tattoo&#x27;s  and again this is the best.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great for my tattoos. Smells good, very soothing, and you don&#x27;t have to rub it in like the lotion. You can just kinda pat it on.</li>
            <li> After going through my artist&#x27;s recommendations, I still found this to be the best care on the market. It has an incredible touch to healing your skin after some awesome ink, which feels like your own skin and no nonsense ointment mess!</li>
            <li> H2Ocean soothes the tattoo when it itches or burns. I would highly recommend this for tattoo aftercare. It&#x27;s WAY better than the stuff I used before.</li>
            <li> This product has always done right by me. I say this with conviction because I love tattoo&#x27;s and i&#x27;m dark-skinned. This product really locks in the ink especially if your tattoo&#x27;s have color.Recommended</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty dedicated/obsessive/militant/committed to tattoo aftercare. I am maniacal about sunscreen and not exposing my ink to the sun for extended periods of time. I also have a pretty strict regimen of lotions, creams and products I use to keep my tattoos looking brand new. I&#x27;ve spent a lot of money on them and am committed to taking care of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if I had to choose one product that shines above all else, it is this product. I have been using it for about 6 months and it is amazing. My tattoos absolutely pop when I use this consistently.&lt;br /&gt;I went about the last month without using any because I ran out and life was pretty hectic. I kept putting off getting more over and over and just stuck to the regular lotion I use (along with this). I finally got a fresh supply of this about a week ago and I can absolutely see the difference already! Regular moisturizing is important but this stuff just seems to really bring out the colors.&lt;br /&gt;If you love your tattoos, do yourself a favor and use this!</li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim after reading a tattoo artist&#x27;s blog endorsing the foam. It was well worth it. It is not oily, greasy, disgusting smelling, doesn&#x27;t give a burning/itching sensation.  Doesn&#x27;t irritate hair follicles surrounding.  It was very soothing to my tattoo, and I enjoyed the usage. I actually looked forward to applying it to my scab because it really made it feel better.  After I didn&#x27;t need it anymore, I gave it my ex-boyfriend and I&#x27;m sure that it can be categorized as one of the best things I have done for him, since he was using Vaseline ew!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. I was looking for something for that awkward state that tattoos enter when they&#x27;re not quite healed yet not super fresh and this does the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use Aquaphor during the initial healing phase where the tattoo is still a little sore and hasn&#x27;t quite developed scabs/a flaking layer yet and it works wonders during that time, but you really have to rub it into the skin for it to absorb. I don&#x27;t want to prematurely pull off any skin from the tattoo, so it&#x27;s a little more difficult to rub in the Aquaphor all the way when the tattoo is starting to peel. That&#x27;s where the H2Ocean foam comes in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You really only need about a quarter sized amount to cover a decent sized tattoo and a little goes a long way. It has kind of a slippery feel at first, but once it rubs it, you don&#x27;t really notice it. It rubs in very easily and I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m going to lift any scabs or damage the tattoo in any way. It has a little bit of a sea salt smell to it which might bother some people. It doesn&#x27;t bother me though as the smell fades quickly. I&#x27;m glad it doesn&#x27;t have an actual added fragrance to it (that can lead to irritation).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pump top is perfect and stays clean and sanitary so you don&#x27;t have to worry contaminating the product with germs, compared to using a tub of product or a tube. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with the pump clogging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this can since December 2014 and I&#x27;ve gotten about 13 hours worth of tattoo work done since then, using this foam for each tattoo. The can probably has two more tattoos worth of product left in it and I&#x27;ll be repurchasing once it&#x27;s empty. The price might seem a bit steep for such a small can, but it lasts!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The can I received looks different than the image shown on the listing so if you get a can that is mostly black with a blue logo, don&#x27;t worry about it being different because it is simply an aesthetic change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, this product is great for healed tattoos also. It doesn&#x27;t contain SPF so it won&#x27;t actually protect your tattoos from the sun, but you can use it when you want your tattoos to look their best. If I&#x27;m going out and I know people will be looking at my work, I put this product on and my ink looks amazing and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the work that I&#x27;ve used this product on has healed wonderfully and very vibrant. Even my artist comments on how bold everything has healed. Great product!</li>
            <li> Kept tattoo moisturized, but faded it in the heavy inking areas. Never had this trouble while using Tattoo Goo.</li>
            <li> best after tattoo care products on the market today!  definitely help shorten my heal time and is instantly soothing the moment you apply it!</li>
            <li> I got my first tattoo,cross, a week ago and ive been using h2Ocean foam ever since! Every day 3-4 times. My tattoo VERY rarely itches and there is no weird bumpy scabbing just peels and flakes. When I put this on and rub it flakes come off...I assume that&#x27;s the same as peeling it with fingers so I don&#x27;t see why so many people say not to peel, aside from if its just starting too and your peeling skin still on you. Once this stuff moisturizes flakes always rub off on mine and i dont see any missing ink. Anyways its been a week and this stuff works great!</li>
            <li> I love it, it&#x27;s really smooth on my skin! Its fine to use in the shower too. You dont need very much also!</li>
            <li> i always use h2 ocean tattoo aftercare when i get new ink work done.  it goes on easily without being oily or sticky.  product does a good job in the healing process of tattoo.</li>
            <li> I only use this product after I get my tattoo done. Fast healing time and great application. Easy to use anywhere and can&#x27;t do better with any other product. Used a few and this is the best out there.</li>
            <li> This product is great. Unlike other tattoo care products, it doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling sticky or greasy. It moisturizes just the right amount. Has a bit of a funny smell to it, but for what it does for your tattoo, the smell is just a minor set back.</li>
            <li> Stick with Aquaphore.  I have several tattoos and in the past I always used aquaphore.  I was recommended this product by my niece.  NEVER AGAIN.  My tattoo did not heal right and is faded in certain areas.  Now I have to go get it touched up.  That never happened to me when using the aquaphore.  I do not recommend this product for tattoos at all.</li>
            <li> This stuff isn&#x27;t just aftercare for tattoos,  I use it for a variety of first aid purposes to keep my skin healthy.  It&#x27;s the best first aid foam out there,  easy to apply,  dries fast and great for the skin with Kelp in it.  Nothing beats this stuff,  nothing!!</li>
