            <li>I&#x27;m so thrilled - buy this over any others on Amazon</li>
            <li>/&gt;-scent isn&#x27;t the best of the 3 I&#x27;ve tried, but not a bad smell in the absolute sense</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-brand is awesome, check out their website to learn more about their values and policies surrounding essential oils&lt;</li>

            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t love the smell.</li>
            <li>love the company Aura Cacia</li>
            <li>Their essential oil combinations are wonderful!  </li>
            <li>I love ginger but the scent doesn&#x27;t come trough...</li>
            <li>I love this Aura Cacia Ginger/Mint, Aromatherapy spray mist.</li>
            <li>After reading about it&#x27;s refreshing scent on Amazon.com,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I am so glad that I did.</li>
            <li>have sleeping problems, and I rest much better spraying this around my bed at night.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The wonderful combination of Lavender and Mint is really terrific.</li>
            <li>Nice, clean aroma.  </li>
            <li>For anyone who grew up chewing Wrigley&#x27;s, this scent will probably seem familiar!</li>
            <li>I love have an aroma that not only smells great but is safe to breathe.</li>
            <li>It is very different and a wonderful combination that is like a fresh breeze.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The light mint scent helps me fall asleep.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It can be used to refresh any room with a few sprays of mist and this scent will have an energizing delightful effect.</li>
            <li>Love aura cacia forever, love their yoga mists, this flavor isn&#x27;t my favorite and arrived with a big dent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li>Love the gentle mist and It is not overpowering.</li>
            <li>The Ginger/Mint spray is my absolute favorite; I carry it in my purse</li>
            <li>/&gt;do feel better, you take deeper breaths which calms your whole being,... and it feels like a heavenly</li>
            <li>I enjoy this particular scent a lot and could no longer find it locally, so I was happy to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>It is made of pure essential oils and has a great smell.</li>
            <li>I thought it would be more gingery, but the main thing I smell is the mint.  </li>
            <li>Fresh and pleasing scent.</li>
            <li>a fresh and inviting aroma.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>have to say, that I agree, I go to sleep sooner and the aroma keeps the room so fresh that I stay asleep longer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I spray this on right before yoga or the gym, it gives me that burst of energy that I need</li>
            <li>It smells nice but as soon as it is dry there is not any scent at all.</li>
            <li>Again, smells nice for the 60 seconds it takes to dry, then nothing.</li>
            <li>br /&gt;-not directly supporting aura cacia</li>
            <li>i was able to relax even if i only had a min to relax..</li>
            <li>Smells exactly like gum.</li>
            <li>I am at once enveloped in a warming blanket of spicy ginger and energizing peppermint---the world is a much friendlier place!  </li>
            <li>especially helps you get to sleep better, because the whole room is refreshed with this Aromatherapy Ginger/Mint mix.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I generally use the spray at night before I go to bed - spray it lightly on my pillowcase or sheet/bedspread.  </li>
            <li>couple of sprays in your bedroom before you go to sleep gives the whole room</li>
            <li>The smell is fresh and invigorating indeed but only for a second and the content is gone quick as well!</li>
            <li>I am allergic to commercial fragrances and even some essential oils bother me, so when I find a fragrance that I love, I rely on it.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I thought itd be a little more gingery.</li>
            <li>I love the scent of ginger, but this is too heavy on the mint.</li>
            <li>It is such a fresh feeling.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Granted, I am somewhat new to aroma therapy.  </li>
            <li>other scents are much better from the same company</li>
            <li>However, I have always used ginger root for its warming properties that sooth digestion and clear the lungs.  </li>
            <li>I also purchased the Peacefule Patchoulli &amp; Sweet Orange scent for winding down.</li>
            <li>There is nothing wrong with this fragrance, but I much prefer the sweet orange/patchouli one.  </li>
            <li>There has to be a way for a body mist to be natural and long lasting at the same time, no excuses.</li>
            <li>If I find a new fragrance (they just released a few, to include \\&quot;Panic Button\\&quot;) I go to my local natural foods store and use the tester to see if I like it.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Love the gentle mist and It is not overpowering.</li>
            <li> Very nice product.  I have tried other &amp;#34;mists&amp;#34; that were full of glycerin oil and were VERY heavy.  I have ordered 6 of their products I&#x27;m so thrilled - buy this over any others on Amazon</li>
            <li> Love it. This spray is used by our Naturopathic doctor in her office. It is made of pure essential oils and has a great smell. I love have an aroma that not only smells great but is safe to breathe. I use it in my office to awaken my senses to help keep me focused throughout the day. You can also use it as a body spray. I also purchased the Peacefule Patchoulli &amp; Sweet Orange scent for winding down.</li>
            <li> This mist smells great and it is uplifting.</li>
            <li> I wish this fragrance lasted longer. As soon as I spray the smell is gone and I need to keep reapplying. There has to be a way for a body mist to be natural and long lasting at the same time, no excuses.The smell is fresh and invigorating indeed but only for a second and the content is gone quick as well!</li>

            <li> Nice, clean aroma.  It takes me back to the mint patch my grandmother had in her backyard.  I notice more mint than ginger so if you try this mist, you should like the smell of mint.</li>
            <li> Very pleased.  Love the product</li>
            <li> when ever i had a moment i would mist in air around me..i was able to relax even if i only had a min to relax..the smell was alot like spearmint and i will buy again ..</li>
            <li> Smells exactly like gum. I thought itd be a little more gingery. Arrived prompt but with a dent kn the bottle.</li>
            <li> Fresh and pleasing scent. A few sprays refresh a room and covers household odors. A little pricey for the volume, but a bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> There is nothing wrong with this fragrance, but I much prefer the sweet orange/patchouli one.  When I use this I feel like a giant stick of chewing gum.  I thought it would be more gingery, but the main thing I smell is the mint.  Aura Cacia is a good company, and this is of good quality...For anyone who grew up chewing Wrigley&#x27;s, this scent will probably seem familiar!</li>
            <li> I discovered this product when I got a sample at the Northwest Women&#x27;s Show in Seattle a few years ago and I love it.

            <li> was disappointed with the fragrance. not invigorating at all, kind of stale weak scent- other scents are much better from the same company</li>
            <li> Meh. I didn&#x27;t love the smell. I love the scent of ginger, but this is too heavy on the mint. It just smells like I have hosed down the body in mouthwash. It smells like the dentist&#x27;s office. Oh well. I will use the rest of the bottle but just not bother buying it again. I&#x27;m still looking for a scent that smells stronger of ginger.</li>
            <li> I am at once enveloped in a warming blanket of spicy ginger and energizing peppermint---the world is a much friendlier place!  Granted, I am somewhat new to aroma therapy.  However, I have always used ginger root for its warming properties that sooth digestion and clear the lungs.  Peppermint, while cooling, is also invigorating.  I never thought to use these two together as an essential oil fragrance due to the opposition of their heating/cooling properties, but as an essential oil fragrance this combination is fabulous!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the company Aura Cacia--they make a great product!  Their essential oil combinations are wonderful!  The Ginger/Mint spray is my absolute favorite; I carry it in my purse so I always have it with me.  I am allergic to commercial fragrances and even some essential oils bother me, so when I find a fragrance that I love, I rely on it.  If I find a new fragrance (they just released a few, to include \\&quot;Panic Button\\&quot;) I go to my local natural foods store and use the tester to see if I like it.  I suppose my only critique would be that I would like Aura Cacia to offer a larger size!</li>
            <li> I love ginger but the scent doesn&#x27;t come trough...only mint. I was expecting something else</li>
            <li> Waste of money. It smells nice but as soon as it is dry there is not any scent at all. I tried spraying on fabric, skin, in the air. Again, smells nice for the 60 seconds it takes to dry, then nothing.</li>
            <li> I love this Aura Cacia Ginger/Mint, Aromatherapy spray mist. A delightful Spray that is like a heavenly breeze. What a treat.&lt;br /&gt;A couple of sprays in your bedroom before you go to sleep gives the whole room a fresh and inviting aroma.&lt;br /&gt;I have never experienced these two scents together before. After reading about it&#x27;s refreshing scent on Amazon.com,&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try it. I am so glad that I did. It is very different and a wonderful combination that is like a fresh breeze.&lt;br /&gt;It can be used to refresh any room with a few sprays of mist and this scent will have an energizing delightful effect. Fresh!&lt;br /&gt;It especially helps you get to sleep better, because the whole room is refreshed with this Aromatherapy Ginger/Mint mix.&lt;br /&gt;I have sleeping problems, and I rest much better spraying this around my bed at night.  It is such a fresh feeling.&lt;br /&gt;I have to say, that I agree, I go to sleep sooner and the aroma keeps the room so fresh that I stay asleep longer.&lt;br /&gt;The wonderful combination of Lavender and Mint is really terrific. As it says,.. it activates the mind and spirit. Somehow,..you&lt;br /&gt;do feel better, you take deeper breaths which calms your whole being,... and it feels like a heavenly breeze.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product. Try it once,..and you will see.  This is a keeper.  I will buy again.</li>
            <li> smells good, so I like it!</li>
