            <li>I have had eczema since forever, and have tried so many soaps and lotions to alleviate the itchiness and help the skin improve...</li>
            <li>It does not have the greatest smell for a female, but you&#x27;ll get use to the smell, and the smell does not stick on you once you&#x27;re out the shower.</li>
            <li>To me, it has a strong scent of a tire shop.</li>

            <li>This stuff is easy on your skin and keeps you clean.</li>
            <li>My husband liked it so much I ordered him a pack.</li>

            <li>It smells good while showering and for a short time after</li>
            <li>oh and the lather is wonderful even when you get down to the very end of the soap</li>

            <li>There are many different options and you need to do a little math to realize the best deal.</li>
            <li>Great natural soap, clean fresh smell lathers up white suds.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve had success with this soap.</li>
            <li>Worth the try....</li>
            <li>I have half a dozen bars of the good soap I use to use just sitting on a shelf.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since I have begun using the soap, it has left my skin feeling clean and smooth.</li>

            <li>If you are looking for a good, old school soap that doesn&#x27;t use sulfates or have fake scents, then I highly recommend Grandpa&#x27;s Pine Tar Soap.</li>
            <li>It is all natural, so don&#x27;t bee fooled by the chemical names in the ingredients.</li>
            <li>Really if you stopped using this product because of the smell you couldn&#x27;t possibly have that severe of a skin problem.</li>

            <li> This is the best soap ever. I initially bought it to wash my beard, but then started using it as my daily soap. It is all natural, so don&#x27;t bee fooled by the chemical names in the ingredients., this is just the scientific terms. For some people, it may be  hard thing to get used to though, especially if you are used to flowery and &amp;#34;sport&amp;#34; scented soap. To me, it has a strong scent of a tire shop. I have also heard it described as a camp fire. Do not be put off by this; you will smell like either. It is a good clean feeling. Apparently, pine tar is also good for several skin conditions.  If you are looking for a good, old school soap that doesn&#x27;t use sulfates or have fake scents, then I highly recommend Grandpa&#x27;s Pine Tar Soap.</li>
            <li> but was told not to use it by my dermatologist.  I gave seven bars away to a neighbor.  I am now an avid Dove fan, using mainly \\&quot;Rose\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> This works great. My husband has very sensitive skin, but with this soap he has no problems. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> If you are a fan of the scent of pine and camp fires, you will enjoy this soap. There arent any fillers or synthetic ingredients. Two thumbs up.</li>
            <li> Great product, resolved skin rash issue I had for years from other soaps.</li>
            <li> I wrote a review on this soap a couple or more years ago. It was great soap then and is great soap now. I use it to bathe from head to toe. I have not needed dandruff shampoo since I started using it. It smells good while showering and for a short time after but the scent dissipates so you are not smelling like a tree all day.( Something I wouldn&#x27;t mind). It lathers up well so I use it for my occasional shave. I have half a dozen bars of the good soap I use to use just sitting on a shelf. Grandpa&#x27;s is Top Shelf Stuff.</li>
            <li> Awesome. Make me smell like a campfire</li>
            <li> Great natural soap, clean fresh smell lathers up white suds. Have used this product for years and use every day.</li>
            <li> i love it but i would prefur free shipping:(</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best. It works great at preventing psoriasis for myself and for my daughter in hot weather.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap for quite some time now. I have very sensitive skin and this is the only soap that does not make me scratch my self to death. I wash my hair with this soap because shampoo makes my head itch. I literally lather myself from my head to my feet, oh and the lather is wonderful even when you get down to the very end of the soap, you still get a great lather.</li>
            <li> This soap actually works.</li>
            <li> This stuff is easy on your skin and keeps you clean.</li>
            <li> Seems like an excellent soap product, works just fine, no lingering aroma of pine tar either. I would buy again.</li>
            <li> This is the only soap my husband will use.  He loves the smell of pine tar and the way the soap makes his skin feel.  Grandpa&#x27;s Pine Tar soap also helps keep fungi at bay (my husband swears by this soap - no more jock itch).  He loves this soap so much that he takes a bar with him on business trips.</li>
            <li> Wonderful soap!  My skin is more hydrated and not itchy.  My scalp is happy and I&#x27;m loving the smell of it.  My wife says it smells like a faint camp fire.  It&#x27;s definitely manly.</li>
            <li> A friend gave a bar of this soap to my husband. My husband liked it so much I ordered him a pack. He swears that it solves the problem of itchy skin, plus its fragrance is mild so I smell nothing cloying.</li>
            <li> I literally have to use this soap. It&#x27;s the only thing that has worked to reduce eczema after showering. So glad I found this. Smell doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. Really if you stopped using this product because of the smell you couldn&#x27;t possibly have that severe of a skin problem. Just smells like pine trees. I&#x27;ve asked my wife and she hasn&#x27;t noticed the smell staying with me at all.  Excellent product. I would suggest paying close attention to the number of bars and the size of the bars in your order. There are many different options and you need to do a little math to realize the best deal.</li>
            <li> I use to drive a 18 wheeler and had trouble with my hands cracking open and bleeding and someone told me about this soap so I gave it a try. I had tried so many things over the years I felt like giving up. That was about twenty years ago and still use it until this day. Like it says Wonder Soap.</li>
            <li> I love the stuff. It cleans as well as any soap but has the wonderful aroma of oakum or tarred twine that I remember from my youth issuing from my father&#x27;s ditty bag...</li>
            <li> This is the only soap I bathe with these days. I&#x27;m over sixty with dry skin and I&#x27;ve had success with this soap.</li>
            <li> After I tried this soap, I never tried any others.</li>
            <li> My favorite and most effective soap.  A little too pricy for everyday use, but worth stocking up on once in a while.</li>
            <li> Rubadubbdub two men in a tub, one used sopa, the other used this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first guy got a bad skin infection. I got clean and stayed clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s what this does</li>
            <li> I have had eczema since forever, and have tried so many soaps and lotions to alleviate the itchiness and help the skin improve...nothing has helped until I tried this soap!!!!! It does not have the greatest smell for a female, but you&#x27;ll get use to the smell, and the smell does not stick on you once you&#x27;re out the shower. So that&#x27;s a good thing...for us ladies. (Smoky smell)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I have begun using the soap, it has left my skin feeling clean and smooth. I cannot believe how effective this soap is and I am blessed to have found this soap. I purchased one for a friend who has psoriasis and it has been working on her skin very well also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have dishydrotic eczema in your hands and feet,  use this in combination with the Edguard cream (tube) it works great together and manages the itchiness and break outs... Awesome!!! Worth the try....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best!</li>
