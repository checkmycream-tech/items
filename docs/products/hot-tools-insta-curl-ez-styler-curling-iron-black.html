            <li>Fast shipping</li>

            <li>Highly recommend this product and buying from this seller.</li>
            <li>if I use 1&amp;#34; ish sized sections and pinch it to form a narrow point, then slide it into the barrel, it does way better and doesn&#x27;t snag like it did, but this took practice.  </li>

            <li> Love love love it !!!! So easy to use!!!!</li>
            <li> I have thick hair just below shoulder length.  This curing wand is very fast and easy to use.  It curls only the bottom 1/2 or so of the hair, so if you are looking for curls from near the scalp down, this is not the tool for you.  I was able to curl my entire head in less than 10 minutes.  The curls held overnight for the most part, only needed a couple of touch ups the next morning.  My only complaint is the location of the on/off switch gets in the way while using.  I have inadvertently turned it off, wondered why it was not curling, and then discovered I had accidentally turned it off.  They need to use a slide type switch rather than a push button switch to turn it on and off to avoid this problem.  If it were not for that, I would have given it 5 stars.  I find it more user friendly (faster and easier to use) than the motorized tools that cost hundreds more.</li>
            <li> This tools is amazing! Perfect curls in no time at all. So easy to use.</li>
            <li> I did really like this... however I decided to return it. It does make really nice curls but I sometimes like to leave my ends straight when i curl and you can&#x27;t do that wit this. I also though it almost made my hair too curly lol. I bought the 1&amp;#34; one. It also seemed to pull my hair out. I didn&#x27;t really notice it when I was curling my hair but I always had to rip the hair our of it when i was done. It is super easy to use and I WOULD recommend it but it just wasn&#x27;t for me... I returned it and bout the 1 1/4&amp;#34; hot tools nano ceramic curling iron so I could have more control of my ends.</li>
            <li> Best &amp; fastest way to do my curls.</li>
            <li> I wanted something like a flat iron/curling iron combo.  I was thinking this would open and close like a flat iron, clamp onto my hair and I could easily pull and twist my hair around it.  Instead you just slide your hair into the gap in between, then you can turn like you would with a curling iron.  Well, for me it didn&#x27;t work well at all!  My hair kept getting stuck in the seams and at some points I&#x27;d have to rip my hair out to get the thing off my head.  Might work well for super straight and smooth hair.  I have kind of average hair, not curly, not pin straight.</li>
            <li> I used this on my niece&#x27;s hair for her prom. She has thick wavy hair, about shoulder length. Normally this would take twice the time using a flat iron, but this tool was awesome. Her curls were more uniformed . She looked beautiful .</li>
            <li> My curls lasted for 5 days! I did my whole head sunday and by thursday, I had some waves at the end and my hair still looked amazing!</li>
            <li> Works awesome! Love this curling iron. The only thing I don&#x27;t like it&#x27;s the location of the buttons but that&#x27;s minor.</li>
            <li> GOOD CONCEPT...EASY TO USE BUT TIME CONSUMING</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd one and I love it.</li>
            <li> Love Love this thing!</li>
            <li> Love it ! So easy to use and the curls stay in all day.</li>
            <li> It makes great curls!  I can get curls quickly and almost one-handed!  Sometimes my hair gets caught in the hinge, though.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent iron if you have shoulder length hair or longer of medium hair texture.  I have just above the shoulder and get curls if I do small enough sections, but my fine hair does get stuck a bit in between the plates.  As my hair grows out, I&#x27;ll get more and more use of it, but not at its current length, so an update is in my future.  Update 05/24/2015 I have practiced with it more as my hair has grown out.  It still takes me 20 or so minutes so do my whole head, but I have super baby fine, super thick hair.  I have learned if I use 1&amp;#34; ish sized sections and pinch it to form a narrow point, then slide it into the barrel, it does way better and doesn&#x27;t snag like it did, but this took practice.  I do recommend using a hold product, but my hair doesn&#x27;t curl easily or hold curl easily.  It does tighter curls with smaller sections, so to wave the hair, use larger sections.  Don&#x27;t forget using a heat protection spray.</li>
            <li> I already own the 1&amp;#34;, bought the 1.25&amp;#34; for me and also bought another 1&amp;#34; as a gift.  Love this product!  Curls hold for days.  Takes a while to get used to using but once you do, you&#x27;ll never go back to using a traditional curling iron!</li>
            <li> Best curling tool ever!!! Fast shipping</li>
            <li> This is the most wonderful thing I have purchased in a very long time. Whoever invented this curling iron, is a genius.&lt;br /&gt;I have the kind of hair, that will never hold a curl no matter what. I have tried  many different things over the years, with no luck, so I was very skeptical of this one. My daughter finally convinced me to try hers and WOW. I had beautiful curls within about 15 minutes, and they lasted all day. It took me a couple of tries to get the hang of how to use it, but once I did, it was super easy and fast.  I immediately ordered myself one and now I can have curls whenever I want.  Also, this price was quite a bit lower than any others I found. Highly recommend this product and buying from this seller.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything to curl my hair, hot curlers, ghd straighteners,  ghd curl wand,  velcro rollers and even sleep in rollers and the minute I step outside its straight within half an hour. I bought this as it was recommended by my hairdresser and I&#x27;ve got to say WOW it works!!!! The curl last 3 days and it takes 20 minutes to curl. I use no product only heat protection. I have long hair and lots if it. Every time I do it everyone asks if I been in the hairdresser to get it done. It looks amazing. Am super impressed by this item and 3 ladies at my work has allready purchase one themselves!!!</li>
            <li> I have never had long hair...ever. I have tried growing my hair but to no avail. I had straight Remmy Indian Hair extensions bonded into my own hair.&lt;br /&gt;I found this curling iron and WOW! do I love the curls it gives my hair! I get so many compliments! I have tried the wand style (several) but I could not master using it. I also have the one that sucks the hair in (can&#x27;t remember what it is called) but that one is time consuming. This heats up in no time and gives a curl that lasts for a good 2 days. I love this, would definitely recommend and would buy again.</li>
            <li> Works really well to curl frizzy hair,  but hair gets caught and pulls a lot.</li>
