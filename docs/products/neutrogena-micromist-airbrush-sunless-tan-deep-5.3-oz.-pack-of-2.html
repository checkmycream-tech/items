            <li>I love this product!!!  </li>

            <li>and the color came out beautiful.</li>

            <li>lol.</li>
            <li>The color was very nice</li>
            <li>it makes you that perfect shade with one and maybe two sprays at the most.  </li>
            <li>Even more impressive-</li>
            <li>By the way, the smell is quite pleasant.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This was new to me as well and the best advice I can give anyone is practice makes perfect!</li>
            <li>I gave it two stars, because although it didnt work great for me, it probably does for someone whos more experienced with self tanner.</li>
            <li>I have fair skin,and I cannot tan.  </li>
            <li>This was an excellent product and I felt like I got my money&#x27;s worth - plus!</li>
            <li>I have an extremely fair skin tone and it still covers well with nice \\&quot;real\\&quot; looking color.</li>
            <li>I said though, I am in love!</li>
            <li>this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>this vendor is always amazing - received products sooner than predicted .</li>
            <li>I wanted to use a self-tanner because I&#x27;m going on a trip and wanted to have a nice color.</li>
            <li>However, the color was nice and it lasted through my workouts and showering after about 4 hrs of using it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use soap, just let warm water rinse off any excess.</li>
            <li>I loved this product on top of my &amp;#34;somewhat&amp;#34; tanned body from the sun.  </li>
            <li>Ok, so i made a point of writing a review because i had a very interesting experience with this product.</li>
            <li>could not believe it, even on my first try, it came out so good!  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a great review on there--first one--that gives advice on other products to use to make a perfect tan every time.  </li>
            <li>The best results will come from clean, fresh exfoliated skin.</li>
            <li>I noticed it too, but I liked it because it let me know when for instance my thighs were touching or</li>
            <li>on easy, I don&#x27;t need help, don&#x27;t have to worry about orange palms!  </li>
            <li>I was so excited about the possibility of a good spray tan.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many self tanners before and this is by far the best one.</li>
            <li>I started out with a very light mist and have gradually increased the amount I apply.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>&quot; you develop to help create the most even color.  </li>
            <li>2nd time I used the spray I got a perfectly even tan all over my legs in the 1st</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t my favorite</li>
            <li>a safe and healthy looking tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Start out applying lightly, and once you have a feel for how to effectivley apply it, you will end up with nice color that doesn&#x27;t wash off with one or two showers.</li>
            <li>I was just glad</li>
            <li>This is the most aggravating product to dispense.  </li>
            <li>Hope this review helps! :)</li>
            <li>In all I love the product.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you spray every part of your body that shows.</li>
            <li>I was sure to exfoliate and shave.  </li>
            <li>The color was lovely, but blotchy...</li>
            <li>I made sure to hold the spray 6 \\&quot; from my body as the directions said.  </li>
            <li>After which it looked a better.</li>
            <li>I was reluctant like most people</li>
            <li>Love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not so sure rubbing it in</li>
            <li>More bang for your buck.</li>
            <li>Make sure to rub the spray in well with your hands, and then WASH YOUR HANDS with soap and water.</li>
            <li>So don&#x27;t try to get a &amp;#34;dark&amp;#34; tan out of this - it&#x27;s perfect for a moderate look.</li>
            <li>I love the sprayer on the product-</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I am sure that it would wipe off easily</li>
            <li>Make sure you get a light mist over the area not a spray.</li>
            <li>It looks completely natural and I have received compliments on how great I look.  </li>
            <li>it delivers the product evenly and guaranteed to be streak free :-)</li>
            <li>The fragrance could be better; smells a bit cheap.  </li>
            <li>I live in Alaska and even if I wasn&#x27;t already anti-tanning I would still never manage to get a real tan up here so this product is perfect for me!    </li>
            <li>I apply to my legs, my arms ( upper mostly on both sides to hide fat lol)  and chest.</li>
            <li>but IT WASHES OUT EASY, so</li>
            <li>so this may be why it was so easy for me.  </li>
            <li>so take it easy in those areas.</li>
            <li>It smelled really strong.</li>
            <li>The product that did come out was indeed a fine mist</li>
            <li>I have very light skin, too, and wanted to look tanned - I rarely tan in the sun, but burn.&lt;br</li>
            <li>As for the result, well, when I use it,(remember I have light skin)</li>
            <li>To start out, I have really light skin.</li>
            <li>Seeing as my skin is so light</li>
            <li>Almost too light for me though.</li>
            <li>Just a tip for those with stretch marks and really light skin</li>
            <li>Fantastic product.  </li>
            <li>I have light colored skin and have used this product over the summer to maintain a tan look without the damage from sun.  </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s super easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I generally purchase self-tanning products for fair or light skin.  </li>
            <li>I really do love this product and recommend it to any first time self tanner users.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping love that it is steak free</li>
            <li>but my face and upper body looked good.</li>
            <li>I can not say enough good things about this product.  </li>
            <li>so I re-sprayed the missed areas the next night and by the 2nd day I had a perfectly even tan!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Lucky for me</li>
            <li>originally I was going to buy it in light or medium because I&#x27;m very fair skinned and didn&#x27;t want to go overboard with too much color.</li>
            <li>Smells nice too (well much better than other spray tans anyway)</li>
            <li>The mist really is a \\&quot;micro mist\\&quot; that goes on super fine for an all over even look.     </li>
            <li>My right leg turned out perfect, my left leg had streaks and blotchs that were orange, a totally different color than my right.</li>
            <li>First of all do not spray too close, spray about 6 inches away and do NOT overspray!</li>
            <li>But after reading reviews of light skinned people, they claimed that the deep was a better choice</li>
            <li>They turned a kind of orange color, which I don&#x27;t mind at all, and wouldn&#x27;t be that noticeable, except in the spots that are still white.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Now, to get the nice medium tan I have now, from the ghost- white legs I had before I started with, it took 4 applications.</li>
            <li>I would not spray this on right before going somewhere, just until you get the hang of it.</li>
            <li>Anyone who says so probably didn&#x27;t do it right</li>
            <li>I washed my hands with soap and water right after.  </li>
            <li>Right after I did all this (as it was \\&quot;developing\\&quot;)-</li>
            <li>Pick the right level for your skin tone.</li>
            <li>but if you&#x27;re not using the right product for your skin tone, you will turn orange.</li>
            <li>I always buy the dark, but I don&#x27;t have fair skin to begin with.</li>
            <li>a half way good product , its just that you need to practice to get it right.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and produces a natural looking tan, not orange on me at all.</li>
            <li>I bought this item for my first time 2 years ago and since then I have rebought and rebought and will rebuy again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been waiting for this product my whole life! &lt;</li>
            <li>I was pleased that the tan still lasted after several showers (although it got lighter with each shower) and it didn&#x27;t rub off on my sheets or clothing.</li>
            <li>I spray my arms first, rub it in, wash my hands.</li>
            <li>At first I purchased the micromist in the \\&quot;2 shades</li>
            <li>I and again, use way more product starting over.</li>
            <li>As a matter of fact, it looks incredibly real!</li>
            <li>I did rub the first two applications in.</li>
            <li>That said, I was pretty nervous to try this.</li>
            <li>The first time I went to use it</li>
            <li>But after showering and exfoliating and reapplying, especially to the areas I missed before, it looked much better.      </li>
            <li>To avoid staining the floor, cabinets, or rugs, make sure you apply it in an enclosed shower or bathtub, or even outside if not windy.</li>
            <li>I tried this product twice, and the first time I thought maybe it was something else I reacted to.  </li>
            <li>I did a quick spray on my face (eyes closed- :)   </li>
            <li>The other wonderful selling point was it will spray when the can is upside down.</li>
            <li>It is very natual, and if you use common sense, you will get great results.</li>
            <li>Work quickly and rub it in until its all blended and make sure to rub it in between the toes too and only lightly around rough areas (knees, ankles, elbows...</li>
            <li>With the deep you do have to be more careful than with the medium shade because it will get orange if you put on too many layers.</li>
            <li>AS with pretty much all self tanners you also have to be mindful of what you&#x27;re wearing if you have applied and haven&#x27;t showered yet as it will rub off on clothing.</li>
            <li>Very realistic tone and has better/finer mist than competitors (like L&#x27;Oreal, which is my second-fave).</li>
            <li>When applying be sure to not stay in one single spot on your body or you will get blotches.</li>
            <li>But there is a certain technique in applying</li>
            <li>So a couple of weeks before the weekend, I decided to test the color of this on a  large section of my leg.</li>
            <li>It was my sister&#x27;s wedding, and I noticed that my pale skin on my dark lavender dress would not be very attractive.</li>
            <li>From someone who has tried several alternatives, I&#x27;d definitely recommend this product (but make sure to rub in!).</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product to any light skinned person looking to have</li>
            <li>For people choosing a self tanner, if $30 isn&#x27;t too much to spend then buy St. Tropez.  </li>
            <li>I then sprayed (very thoroughly) all over my legs and arms and torso.</li>
            <li>I have mediam light asian skin tone, and wanted to find something that would give me that bronzy look for summer without the fear of skin damage from uv rays.</li>
            <li>Try not to spray in one area too much.</li>
            <li>so I really can&#x27;t complain about it.</li>
            <li>WELL, neutrogena really knows their stuff.</li>
            <li>but it does get really \\&quot;foggy\\&quot; in the bathroom when you spray it</li>
            <li>I highly recommend giving it a go!</li>
            <li>the medium sunless spray is much better,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, this actually makes them more visable not hidden</li>
            <li>Lotion is key in maintaining the original color.     </li>
            <li>This is the only way I&#x27;ve found to really get a realistic level of red that makes a tan look absolutely authentic at a &amp;#34;dark&amp;#34; level.</li>
            <li>When spraying hands; make sure to keep fingers spread apart and slightly bent.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I tried the Jergens brand and it was better, although it took a little longer to get the results I wanted.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to only wash your fingers and end up with tanning stains on your upper wrist/lower palm area.</li>
            <li>That means easy application to the middle of your back!</li>
            <li>darker\\&quot; and it came out very natural looking.</li>
            <li>Save time and $ on tanning salons and the tan looks very natural.</li>
            <li>If you find you have missed an area it is easily touched up after color is fully developed, (on average 8-10 hours).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and this was my first and LAST purchase from this vendor.  </li>
            <li>At first I did as the directions said and did not rub it in - BIG MISTAKE!</li>
            <li>You need to reapply several times a week to hold on to color but a can will last 2 or more weeks if you don&#x27;t spray your entire body.</li>
            <li>I have tried St. Tropez self tanners (foam, gel, lotion you name it) and many other brands and always come back to this one!</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s the scoop on the orange color people get when they spray tan: if you are using a product with a high amount of DHA (that&#x27;s what makes your skin tan), and you are pasty white and normally burn, you will probably get an orange hue.</li>
            <li>I was DUMPED ON and used by this vendor to get rid of old stock that doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>I only did my legs and not my whole body.</li>
            <li>Not orange at all, just a natural tan glow.     </li>
            <li>this this product would work really well with a second person involved to apply the product.  </li>
            <li>I was actually worried I would end up using the whole</li>
            <li>Now one week later I look like I have a real tan.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t just spray your face directly -- spray into your cupped palm, rub your hands together, and rub all over your face like moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I would not waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li>I use white towel, and they wash clean,  and I use scrubbing bubbles on toilet lid, My only concern is my new BMW with light cream seats, so I am careful to place a towel for the back of my legs.</li>
            <li>My stomach is a nice tan color, my chest got a little darker albeit slightly splotchy, and my legs are just embarrassing.</li>
            <li>I have very pale white skin tone and bought the 3 shades darker version and love it.</li>
            <li>First of all, like everyone else, I spent time researching sunless tan products before I purchased.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not hard to get used to using it even on your back.</li>
            <li>I had the same results as other light skinned reviewers - the results were not even on all body parts - my face, neck, upper chest, lower arms tanned.</li>
            <li>I take a shower scrubbing my skin really well, dry off and immediately spray it on.  </li>
            <li>For the most realistic fake tan at home, I&#x27;ll spend $30-$40 on a lotion tanner with bronzer.</li>
            <li>Another quick tip is I apply a little lotion on the creases of my fingers, toes, back of heels, elbows and knees.   </li>
            <li>I liked the color, it only streaked a little, but after a day I put on white pants and it made my pants a little orange.</li>
            <li>After the tan has set in completely, usually after 8 hours, I take a quick shower.</li>
            <li>Also, I am a dude, so I like that this just smells like pure DHA (the active ingredient in all self-tanners) and doesn&#x27;t smell like strawberry unicorns or whatever.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Even though it is colorless when being applied, if you watch carefully you can see if you have gotten too close and if too much tanner has been applied in a specific area.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been applying an even coat everyday fo five days since I bought this product because I did not see a difference at first, and I spray the spots that I miss in an attempt to even it out.</li>
            <li>-Caused by spraying to close and spraying straight down my leg in sections.</li>
            <li>Also, be careful on hands and feet, you really only need a quick even spray or else the color will look too dark.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t smell any better or worse than any other professional spray tan I ever had and after a day I didn&#x27;t notice a smell anymore.</li>
            <li>Of course we all want a deep dark tan fast</li>
            <li>/&gt;8 hours later when I resprayed the legs, I noted the results the next day: the results were patchy - parts that usually can tan turned orange, while areas that rarely tan stayed white - I had orange spotted legs.</li>
            <li>I ordered a case of Neutrogena MicroMist Sunless Tanning Spray Dark from this vendor and they sent me OLD STOCK that was manufactured in 2006 !!</li>

            <li> I love this product!!!  </li>
            <li> My skin is very fair and it had an orange tint on my legs</li>
            <li> so my skin tone is very fair.</li>
            <li> I loved this product!</li>
            <li> and the color came out beautiful.</li>
            <li> It looked like a beautiful brown beach tan.</li>
            <li> This truly is a great product.</li>
            <li> lol.</li>
            <li> The color was very nice</li>
            <li> it makes you that perfect shade with one and maybe two sprays at the most.  </li>
            <li> Even more impressive-</li>
            <li> By the way, the smell is quite pleasant.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This was new to me as well and the best advice I can give anyone is practice makes perfect!</li>
            <li> I gave it two stars, because although it didnt work great for me, it probably does for someone whos more experienced with self tanner.</li>
            <li> I have fair skin,and I cannot tan.  </li>
            <li> This was an excellent product and I felt like I got my money&#x27;s worth - plus!</li>
            <li> I have an extremely fair skin tone and it still covers well with nice \\&quot;real\\&quot; looking color.</li>
            <li> I said though, I am in love!</li>
            <li> this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> this vendor is always amazing - received products sooner than predicted .</li>
            <li> I wanted to use a self-tanner because I&#x27;m going on a trip and wanted to have a nice color.</li>
            <li> However, the color was nice and it lasted through my workouts and showering after about 4 hrs of using it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use soap, just let warm water rinse off any excess.</li>
            <li> I loved this product on top of my &amp;#34;somewhat&amp;#34; tanned body from the sun.  </li>
            <li> Ok, so i made a point of writing a review because i had a very interesting experience with this product.</li>
            <li> could not believe it, even on my first try, it came out so good!  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a great review on there--first one--that gives advice on other products to use to make a perfect tan every time.  </li>
            <li> The best results will come from clean, fresh exfoliated skin.</li>
            <li> I noticed it too, but I liked it because it let me know when for instance my thighs were touching or</li>
            <li> on easy, I don&#x27;t need help, don&#x27;t have to worry about orange palms!  </li>
            <li> I was so excited about the possibility of a good spray tan.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many self tanners before and this is by far the best one.</li>
            <li> I started out with a very light mist and have gradually increased the amount I apply.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> &quot; you develop to help create the most even color.  </li>
            <li> 2nd time I used the spray I got a perfectly even tan all over my legs in the 1st</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t my favorite</li>
            <li> a safe and healthy looking tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Start out applying lightly, and once you have a feel for how to effectivley apply it, you will end up with nice color that doesn&#x27;t wash off with one or two showers.</li>
            <li> I was just glad</li>
            <li> This is the most aggravating product to dispense.  </li>
            <li> Hope this review helps! :)</li>
            <li> In all I love the product.</li>
            <li> Just make sure you spray every part of your body that shows.</li>
            <li> I was sure to exfoliate and shave.  </li>
            <li> The color was lovely, but blotchy...</li>
            <li> I made sure to hold the spray 6 \\&quot; from my body as the directions said.  </li>
            <li> After which it looked a better.</li>
            <li> I was reluctant like most people</li>
            <li> Love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not so sure rubbing it in</li>
            <li> More bang for your buck.</li>
            <li> Make sure to rub the spray in well with your hands, and then WASH YOUR HANDS with soap and water.</li>
            <li> So don&#x27;t try to get a &amp;#34;dark&amp;#34; tan out of this - it&#x27;s perfect for a moderate look.</li>
            <li> I love the sprayer on the product-</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I am sure that it would wipe off easily</li>
            <li> Make sure you get a light mist over the area not a spray.</li>
            <li> It looks completely natural and I have received compliments on how great I look.  </li>
            <li> it delivers the product evenly and guaranteed to be streak free :-)</li>
            <li> The fragrance could be better; smells a bit cheap.  </li>
            <li> I live in Alaska and even if I wasn&#x27;t already anti-tanning I would still never manage to get a real tan up here so this product is perfect for me!    </li>
            <li> I apply to my legs, my arms ( upper mostly on both sides to hide fat lol)  and chest.</li>
            <li> but IT WASHES OUT EASY, so</li>
            <li> so this may be why it was so easy for me.  </li>
            <li> so take it easy in those areas.</li>
            <li> It smelled really strong.</li>
            <li> The product that did come out was indeed a fine mist</li>
            <li> I have very light skin, too, and wanted to look tanned - I rarely tan in the sun, but burn.&lt;br</li>
            <li> As for the result, well, when I use it,(remember I have light skin)</li>
            <li> To start out, I have really light skin.</li>
            <li> Seeing as my skin is so light</li>
            <li> Almost too light for me though.</li>
            <li> Just a tip for those with stretch marks and really light skin</li>
            <li> Fantastic product.  </li>
            <li> I have light colored skin and have used this product over the summer to maintain a tan look without the damage from sun.  </li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s super easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I generally purchase self-tanning products for fair or light skin.  </li>
            <li> I really do love this product and recommend it to any first time self tanner users.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping love that it is steak free</li>
            <li> but my face and upper body looked good.</li>
            <li> I can not say enough good things about this product.  </li>
            <li> so I re-sprayed the missed areas the next night and by the 2nd day I had a perfectly even tan!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Lucky for me</li>
            <li> originally I was going to buy it in light or medium because I&#x27;m very fair skinned and didn&#x27;t want to go overboard with too much color.</li>
            <li> Smells nice too (well much better than other spray tans anyway)</li>
            <li> The mist really is a \\&quot;micro mist\\&quot; that goes on super fine for an all over even look.     </li>
            <li> My right leg turned out perfect, my left leg had streaks and blotchs that were orange, a totally different color than my right.</li>
            <li> First of all do not spray too close, spray about 6 inches away and do NOT overspray!</li>
            <li> But after reading reviews of light skinned people, they claimed that the deep was a better choice</li>
            <li> They turned a kind of orange color, which I don&#x27;t mind at all, and wouldn&#x27;t be that noticeable, except in the spots that are still white.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Now, to get the nice medium tan I have now, from the ghost- white legs I had before I started with, it took 4 applications.</li>
            <li> I would not spray this on right before going somewhere, just until you get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> Anyone who says so probably didn&#x27;t do it right</li>
            <li> I washed my hands with soap and water right after.  </li>
            <li> Right after I did all this (as it was \\&quot;developing\\&quot;)-</li>
            <li> Pick the right level for your skin tone.</li>
            <li> but if you&#x27;re not using the right product for your skin tone, you will turn orange.</li>
            <li> I always buy the dark, but I don&#x27;t have fair skin to begin with.</li>
            <li> a half way good product , its just that you need to practice to get it right.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and produces a natural looking tan, not orange on me at all.</li>
            <li> I bought this item for my first time 2 years ago and since then I have rebought and rebought and will rebuy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been waiting for this product my whole life! &lt;</li>
            <li> I was pleased that the tan still lasted after several showers (although it got lighter with each shower) and it didn&#x27;t rub off on my sheets or clothing.</li>
            <li> I spray my arms first, rub it in, wash my hands.</li>
            <li> At first I purchased the micromist in the \\&quot;2 shades</li>
            <li> I and again, use way more product starting over.</li>
            <li> As a matter of fact, it looks incredibly real!</li>
            <li> I did rub the first two applications in.</li>
            <li> That said, I was pretty nervous to try this.</li>
            <li> The first time I went to use it</li>
            <li> But after showering and exfoliating and reapplying, especially to the areas I missed before, it looked much better.      </li>
            <li> To avoid staining the floor, cabinets, or rugs, make sure you apply it in an enclosed shower or bathtub, or even outside if not windy.</li>
            <li> I tried this product twice, and the first time I thought maybe it was something else I reacted to.  </li>
            <li> I did a quick spray on my face (eyes closed- :)   </li>
            <li> The other wonderful selling point was it will spray when the can is upside down.</li>
            <li> It is very natual, and if you use common sense, you will get great results.</li>
            <li> Work quickly and rub it in until its all blended and make sure to rub it in between the toes too and only lightly around rough areas (knees, ankles, elbows...</li>
            <li> With the deep you do have to be more careful than with the medium shade because it will get orange if you put on too many layers.</li>
            <li> AS with pretty much all self tanners you also have to be mindful of what you&#x27;re wearing if you have applied and haven&#x27;t showered yet as it will rub off on clothing.</li>
            <li> Very realistic tone and has better/finer mist than competitors (like L&#x27;Oreal, which is my second-fave).</li>
            <li> When applying be sure to not stay in one single spot on your body or you will get blotches.</li>
            <li> But there is a certain technique in applying</li>
            <li> So a couple of weeks before the weekend, I decided to test the color of this on a  large section of my leg.</li>
            <li> It was my sister&#x27;s wedding, and I noticed that my pale skin on my dark lavender dress would not be very attractive.</li>
            <li> From someone who has tried several alternatives, I&#x27;d definitely recommend this product (but make sure to rub in!).</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product to any light skinned person looking to have</li>
            <li> For people choosing a self tanner, if $30 isn&#x27;t too much to spend then buy St. Tropez.  </li>
            <li> I then sprayed (very thoroughly) all over my legs and arms and torso.</li>
            <li> I have mediam light asian skin tone, and wanted to find something that would give me that bronzy look for summer without the fear of skin damage from uv rays.</li>
            <li> Try not to spray in one area too much.</li>
            <li> so I really can&#x27;t complain about it.</li>
            <li> WELL, neutrogena really knows their stuff.</li>
            <li> but it does get really \\&quot;foggy\\&quot; in the bathroom when you spray it</li>
            <li> I highly recommend giving it a go!</li>
            <li> the medium sunless spray is much better,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , this actually makes them more visable not hidden</li>
            <li> Lotion is key in maintaining the original color.     </li>
            <li> This is the only way I&#x27;ve found to really get a realistic level of red that makes a tan look absolutely authentic at a &amp;#34;dark&amp;#34; level.</li>
            <li> When spraying hands; make sure to keep fingers spread apart and slightly bent.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I tried the Jergens brand and it was better, although it took a little longer to get the results I wanted.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to only wash your fingers and end up with tanning stains on your upper wrist/lower palm area.</li>
            <li> That means easy application to the middle of your back!</li>
            <li> darker\\&quot; and it came out very natural looking.</li>
            <li> Save time and $ on tanning salons and the tan looks very natural.</li>
            <li> If you find you have missed an area it is easily touched up after color is fully developed, (on average 8-10 hours).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and this was my first and LAST purchase from this vendor.  </li>
            <li> At first I did as the directions said and did not rub it in - BIG MISTAKE!</li>
            <li> You need to reapply several times a week to hold on to color but a can will last 2 or more weeks if you don&#x27;t spray your entire body.</li>
            <li> I have tried St. Tropez self tanners (foam, gel, lotion you name it) and many other brands and always come back to this one!</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s the scoop on the orange color people get when they spray tan: if you are using a product with a high amount of DHA (that&#x27;s what makes your skin tan), and you are pasty white and normally burn, you will probably get an orange hue.</li>
            <li> I was DUMPED ON and used by this vendor to get rid of old stock that doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I only did my legs and not my whole body.</li>
            <li> Not orange at all, just a natural tan glow.     </li>
            <li> this this product would work really well with a second person involved to apply the product.  </li>
            <li> I was actually worried I would end up using the whole</li>
            <li> Now one week later I look like I have a real tan.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t just spray your face directly -- spray into your cupped palm, rub your hands together, and rub all over your face like moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I would not waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> I use white towel, and they wash clean,  and I use scrubbing bubbles on toilet lid, My only concern is my new BMW with light cream seats, so I am careful to place a towel for the back of my legs.</li>
            <li> My stomach is a nice tan color, my chest got a little darker albeit slightly splotchy, and my legs are just embarrassing.</li>
            <li> I have very pale white skin tone and bought the 3 shades darker version and love it.</li>
            <li> First of all, like everyone else, I spent time researching sunless tan products before I purchased.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not hard to get used to using it even on your back.</li>
            <li> I had the same results as other light skinned reviewers - the results were not even on all body parts - my face, neck, upper chest, lower arms tanned.</li>
            <li> I take a shower scrubbing my skin really well, dry off and immediately spray it on.  </li>
            <li> For the most realistic fake tan at home, I&#x27;ll spend $30-$40 on a lotion tanner with bronzer.</li>
            <li> Another quick tip is I apply a little lotion on the creases of my fingers, toes, back of heels, elbows and knees.   </li>
            <li> I liked the color, it only streaked a little, but after a day I put on white pants and it made my pants a little orange.</li>
            <li> After the tan has set in completely, usually after 8 hours, I take a quick shower.</li>
            <li> Also, I am a dude, so I like that this just smells like pure DHA (the active ingredient in all self-tanners) and doesn&#x27;t smell like strawberry unicorns or whatever.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Even though it is colorless when being applied, if you watch carefully you can see if you have gotten too close and if too much tanner has been applied in a specific area.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been applying an even coat everyday fo five days since I bought this product because I did not see a difference at first, and I spray the spots that I miss in an attempt to even it out.</li>
            <li> -Caused by spraying to close and spraying straight down my leg in sections.</li>
            <li> Also, be careful on hands and feet, you really only need a quick even spray or else the color will look too dark.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t smell any better or worse than any other professional spray tan I ever had and after a day I didn&#x27;t notice a smell anymore.</li>
            <li> Of course we all want a deep dark tan fast</li>
            <li> /&gt;8 hours later when I resprayed the legs, I noted the results the next day: the results were patchy - parts that usually can tan turned orange, while areas that rarely tan stayed white - I had orange spotted legs.</li>
            <li> I ordered a case of Neutrogena MicroMist Sunless Tanning Spray Dark from this vendor and they sent me OLD STOCK that was manufactured in 2006 !!</li>
            <li> I use a small make-up sponge and dab those spots lightly to prevent dripping and uneven color.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would recommend getting two bottles if you are really light skinned and want a dark tan, put on layers slowly, be patient and let your tan build up.</li>
            <li> When you&#x27;re completely dry, the stickiness is gone, but it will last several hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do recommend spraying enough to get your skin a tiny bit wet</li>
            <li> Third, the \\&quot;deep\\&quot; color barely showed up on my fairly pale skin (which actually worked out to my advantage, since then you could not really see the streaking, since the \\&quot;deep\\&quot; color was just barely darker than my skin).</li>
            <li> Those with streaks or splotches were probably spraying in very close hard strokes to their skin.   </li>
            <li> One more thing, I spray my legs and arms outside on the back deck, that way the fumes aren&#x27;t as bad</li>
            <li> Its taking a long time to go away.  </li>
            <li> The next day, my calves were white except for the drip marks running down them, and my heels and arches of my feet had pools of super-dark \\&quot;tan\\&quot; on them.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Exfoliating just before application will help remove and dry flakey skin, and that is important.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I notice it because I don&#x27;t exfoliate and pat dry</li>
            <li> and I dry a lot faster in the sun .</li>
            <li> After my face felt dry-</li>
            <li> and then let air dry.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t worry about the rest of my body that isn&#x27;t generally seen  in order not to waste the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m half hispanic and half german, but i got superpale german skin.  </li>
            <li> only downside is if you go really overboard, your skin will look too yellow.</li>
            <li> but I had very limited contact with the mist.  </li>
            <li> I buy this brand at rite aid and it is a little different.</li>
            <li> I noticed it was hard to tell how evenly I had sprayed it because it goes on clear.</li>
            <li> The nozzle did not spray after repeated tries.  </li>
            <li> - I thought this product was supposed to last a few days?</li>
            <li> This is not what I expected.</li>
            <li> In the sun, my legs look like an orange creamsicle, and I&#x27;m going to have to wear jeans until it washes away, even in this the hot humid climate where I live.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dont know what I&#x27;m doing wrong.</li>
            <li> I  was terrified I&#x27;d end up looking like a zebra like the other posters.  </li>
            <li> Before buying this product I read the other reviews.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m sick of looking pale and washed out, and I really don&#x27;t want cancer from tanning, thanks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m shocked how easy it is.  </li>
            <li> If this happens, it&#x27;s actually not that hard to rub away any streaks or unwanted pigmentation with a towel.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t turn dark.   </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth the $11.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it makes my skin itchy immediately after application, however, I&#x27;ve found that if I apply lotion after it dries, the itch is gone.  </li>
            <li> It sprays on even and you can get everywhere because the can even sprays while up side down.  </li>
            <li> I continue this doing my legs from the knees down and then from the knees up.</li>
            <li> Thank you Neutrogena for saving other people from having to be blinded my pastiness!</li>
            <li> cans are packaged in the dark orange/gold can with the BLACK stripe highlighting the title Neutrogena.</li>
            <li> but there where a few spots that I didn&#x27;t spray as well</li>
            <li> then you would (as one reviewer stated) end up with uneven color, missed spots and even drips.</li>
            <li> I used the scrub with the gloves in the bath and then dried off thoroughly.   </li>
            <li> I found this at Rite aid after reading a few reviews for it, and decided to get it.</li>
            <li> I use every few days, and the bottle lasts me for a couple weeks.</li>
            <li> I had to wear pants for a week and a half!</li>
            <li> It does come off on your clothing, your toilet seat ( from behind thighs)</li>
            <li> What a mess !  </li>
            <li> (He never notices anything so must of been pretty bad)  </li>
            <li> I used almost a full bottle to getto the base tan I wanted.</li>
            <li> Perhaps it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m new to spray-on tans, but my results were disappointing and embarrassing.  </li>
            <li> The smell was neutral enough but I still detect a faint tanning spray odor.  </li>
            <li> I usually like their product</li>
            <li> so I switched from my usual St. Tropez to save some money.  </li>
            <li> I usually go for the light/medium self tanners.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t go overboard</li>
            <li> My suggestion is to test a SMALL area and wait a couple days.</li>
            <li> But I just tried a new bottle and its given me the worst bumpy rash on the legs and arms and upper chest.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product several times this summer and have not had one bad experience.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t bad, but I would not wear white with this product.</li>
            <li> First, it smells awful, like hairspray.</li>
            <li> I was about to give up since my fingers were tired</li>
            <li> After using a variety of drugstore spray tanners, this one is by far the worst I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> After reading up some, I&#x27;m going to switch to Fake Bake.  </li>
            <li> I cannot find one spot that looks weird.  </li>
            <li> I was not impressed.</li>
            <li> So I have never used sunless tanners, I was always afraid of ending up looking like an oompa-loompa.</li>
            <li> I came on this site and read all the bad reviews of this product.</li>
            <li> I was shocked that the spray covered so well and did not leave streaks.</li>
            <li> This turned out horrible!</li>
            <li> or you will end up with horrible yuck brown on the bottom of your feet where the mist has hit the floor</li>
            <li> Worst of all, though, was that the product dripped, and I didn&#x27;t realize it.  </li>
            <li> It looked awful.  </li>
            <li> I hate having to recruit my husband or kids to help me with tanning myself!  </li>
            <li> Horrible......</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My skin is very fair and it had an orange tint on my legs but my face and upper body looked good. I am just not chancing it in the future and will save my money</li>
            <li> I bought this item for my first time 2 years ago and since then I have rebought and rebought and will rebuy again. I love it. But there is a certain technique in applying or else you wont be very happy with the results...First of all do not spray too close, spray about 6 inches away and do NOT overspray! Or else you get that orange color because it is not meant to be oversprayed it makes you that perfect shade with one and maybe two sprays at the most.  Work quickly and rub it in until its all blended and make sure to rub it in between the toes too and only lightly around rough areas (knees, ankles, elbows...etc) . I have an olive skin tone and it makes the realest sexiest tan for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been waiting for this product my whole life! &lt;br /&gt;Goes on easy, I don&#x27;t need help, don&#x27;t have to worry about orange palms!  Like any beauty routine, I do believe there is a \\&quot;technique\\&quot; you develop to help create the most even color.  Those with streaks or splotches were probably spraying in very close hard strokes to their skin.   &lt;br /&gt;I could not believe it, even on my first try, it came out so good!  I can not say enough good things about this product.  Thank you Neutrogena for saving other people from having to be blinded my pastiness! LOL!</li>
            <li> I ordered a case of Neutrogena MicroMist Sunless Tanning Spray Dark from this vendor and they sent me OLD STOCK that was manufactured in 2006 !! It doesn&#x27;t turn dark.   The 5.3oz. cans are packaged in the dark orange/gold can with the BLACK stripe highlighting the title Neutrogena. In 2008 Neutrogena started making their MicroMist Sunless Tanning in the lighter gold cans with the BLUE stripe highlighting the title Neutrogena.  I was DUMPED ON and used by this vendor to get rid of old stock that doesn&#x27;t work. I purchase 4 cases a year..and this was my first and LAST purchase from this vendor.

            <li> I loved this product! originally I was going to buy it in light or medium because I&#x27;m very fair skinned and didn&#x27;t want to go overboard with too much color. But after reading reviews of light skinned people, they claimed that the deep was a better choice so I went with the deep color and I was very happy with my decision! the 1st time I sprayed it on my legs I noticed it was hard to tell how evenly I had sprayed it because it goes on clear. I did it later at night and the tan truly does take 2-4 hours to start showing so I didn&#x27;t get to see the results till the next morning. The color was very nice but there where a few spots that I didn&#x27;t spray as well so I re-sprayed the missed areas the next night and by the 2nd day I had a perfectly even tan!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the 2nd time I used the spray I got a perfectly even tan all over my legs in the 1st try so it was definitely a trial and error process for me. I was pleased that the tan still lasted after several showers (although it got lighter with each shower) and it didn&#x27;t rub off on my sheets or clothing. The smell isn&#x27;t my favorite but it doesn&#x27;t smell any better or worse than any other professional spray tan I ever had and after a day I didn&#x27;t notice a smell anymore. I would definitely recommend this product to any light skinned person looking to have a safe and healthy looking tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;side note (I have only tried this product on my legs). also, it was cheaper to buy the product at target then here on Amazon...</li>
            <li> I love this product!!!  I have fair skin,and I cannot tan.  I burn and peel, but I like the look of a tan.  This product does it, and it does it well.  I have been using it for about 5 years now, and never once had a problem with it.  It sprays on even and you can get everywhere because the can even sprays while up side down.  As for the result, well, when I use it,(remember I have light skin) everyone compliments me on my tan!!  I look like I just got off a cruise ship.  It is very natual, and if you use common sense, you will get great results.</li>
            <li> I have used this product several times this summer and have not had one bad experience. I have an extremely fair skin tone and it still covers well with nice \\&quot;real\\&quot; looking color. I do believe it probably lasts longer on someone who has an olive skin tone or something similar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Exfoliating just before application will help remove and dry flakey skin, and that is important.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best advice I can give regarding this product is you need to use it just as the manufacturer recommends. If you spray too close to your skin then you would (as one reviewer stated) end up with uneven color, missed spots and even drips. Even though it is colorless when being applied, if you watch carefully you can see if you have gotten too close and if too much tanner has been applied in a specific area. I use a small make-up sponge and dab those spots lightly to prevent dripping and uneven color. If you find you have missed an area it is easily touched up after color is fully developed, (on average 8-10 hours).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was new to me as well and the best advice I can give anyone is practice makes perfect! Start out applying lightly, and once you have a feel for how to effectivley apply it, you will end up with nice color that doesn&#x27;t wash off with one or two showers.</li>
            <li> Ok, so i made a point of writing a review because i had a very interesting experience with this product. I gave it two stars, because although it didnt work great for me, it probably does for someone whos more experienced with self tanner. To start out, I have really light skin. I&#x27;m half hispanic and half german, but i got superpale german skin.  My skin does not \\&quot;tan\\&quot;, but just gets a shade or two darker when I get some sun. So i got self tanner, in hopes i could get a tan from a bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product worked completely differently on all my bodyparts. My stomach is a nice tan color, my chest got a little darker albeit slightly splotchy, and my legs are just embarrassing. They turned a kind of orange color, which I don&#x27;t mind at all, and wouldn&#x27;t be that noticeable, except in the spots that are still white. In the sun, my legs look like an orange creamsicle, and I&#x27;m going to have to wear jeans until it washes away, even in this the hot humid climate where I live.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dont know what I&#x27;m doing wrong. I&#x27;ve been applying an even coat everyday fo five days since I bought this product because I did not see a difference at first, and I spray the spots that I miss in an attempt to even it out. I even rub it in, to try and avoid that patchy orange look, but I got it anyway. I guess I just need to get the hang of it. I would not spray this on right before going somewhere, just until you get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> I wanted to use a self-tanner because I&#x27;m going on a trip and wanted to have a nice color. I liked the color, it only streaked a little, but after a day I put on white pants and it made my pants a little orange. I got a baby wipe and then proceeded to see if it came off it did. It wasn&#x27;t bad, but I would not wear white with this product. I tried the Jergens brand and it was better, although it took a little longer to get the results I wanted.</li>
            <li> I was so excited about the possibility of a good spray tan. HA!!  This turned out horrible! There were spaces all over my legs that didn&#x27;t turn out. There were drip marks in some places. It was so splotchy. I was just glad I only did my legs and not my whole body. I had to wear pants for a week and a half! Yes, I did exfoliate before hand, but that didn&#x27;t seem to matter.</li>
            <li> This is the most aggravating product to dispense.  The nozzle did not spray after repeated tries.  I was about to give up since my fingers were tired but suddenly the product came out only to stop again after I sprayed one leg.  Again, it would not dispense no matter where I pressed on the nozzle.  The product that did come out was indeed a fine mist but I had very limited contact with the mist.  The smell was neutral enough but I still detect a faint tanning spray odor.  Going to write to Neutrogena about their faulty nozzle.  I usually like their product so I switched from my usual St. Tropez to save some money.  I learned my lesson.  For people choosing a self tanner, if $30 isn&#x27;t too much to spend then buy St. Tropez.  It is the best color, best odor and now I learned the best dispenser out of all the self tanners out there.</li>
            <li> At first I did as the directions said and did not rub it in - BIG MISTAKE! However, the color was nice and it lasted through my workouts and showering after about 4 hrs of using it. So, I tried again, instead, I blended it. This seemed to work. I&#x27;ve mastered a routine of how to get the best results. I spray my arms first, rub it in, wash my hands. Then I do my chest and torso area, rub it in, wash my hands. I continue this doing my legs from the knees down and then from the knees up. I did find that I was coughing after I did this, so I bought those face masks that doctors use and it seems to help. By the way, the smell is quite pleasant. From someone who has tried several alternatives, I&#x27;d definitely recommend this product (but make sure to rub in!).</li>
            <li> This is a great product!  You just have to follow the directions and apply with care.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years and I have NEVER turned orange or had streaks!  Anyone who says so probably didn&#x27;t do it right and it&#x27;s not hard to get used to using it even on your back.</li>
            <li> This truly is a great product. I&#x27;ve used many self tanners before and this is by far the best one. The mist really is a \\&quot;micro mist\\&quot; that goes on super fine for an all over even look.     I&#x27;m mostly French and English so my skin tone is very fair. Seeing as my skin is so light I usually go for the light/medium self tanners. At first I purchased the micromist in the \\&quot;2 shades darker\\&quot; and it came out very natural looking. Almost too light for me though. I wanted a deeper color so I purchased the \\&quot;3 shades darker\\&quot; and the color came out beautiful. Not orange at all, just a natural tan glow.     When applying be sure to not stay in one single spot on your body or you will get blotches. You must spray in continuous, even strokes. Also, be careful on hands and feet, you really only need a quick even spray or else the color will look too dark. When spraying hands; make sure to keep fingers spread apart and slightly bent. Another quick tip is I apply a little lotion on the creases of my fingers, toes, back of heels, elbows and knees.   A huuuge tip is to definitely exfoliate. The best results will come from clean, fresh exfoliated skin. After the tan has set in completely, usually after 8 hours, I take a quick shower. I don&#x27;t use soap, just let warm water rinse off any excess. Then after I apply lotion. Lotion is key in maintaining the original color.     I really do love this product and recommend it to any first time self tanner users. Hope this review helps! :)</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years. I always buy the dark, but I don&#x27;t have fair skin to begin with. It is easy to use and produces a natural looking tan, not orange on me at all. I spay it on in the morning, then I reapply a second coat around lunch if I need additional color for that evening, if not I wait till the next day. You need to reapply several times a week to hold on to color but a can will last 2 or more weeks if you don&#x27;t spray your entire body. I apply to my legs, my arms ( upper mostly on both sides to hide fat lol)  and chest. I don&#x27;t worry about the rest of my body that isn&#x27;t generally seen  in order not to waste the product. It does come off on your clothing, your toilet seat ( from behind thighs) your car seat and your towels after showering unless you exfoliate every time. I and again, use way more product starting over. I notice it because I don&#x27;t exfoliate and pat dry but IT WASHES OUT EASY, so don&#x27;t panic. I use white towel, and they wash clean,  and I use scrubbing bubbles on toilet lid, My only concern is my new BMW with light cream seats, so I am careful to place a towel for the back of my legs. I am sure that it would wipe off easily but I am not taking a chance! Don&#x27;t use lotion until it dries for several hours, It tends to interfere with the development process, and I shower the night of my application so that it doesn&#x27;t stain my sheets, and if you apply two coats it will trust me. In all I love the product. Save time and $ on tanning salons and the tan looks very natural. Just make sure you spray every part of your body that shows. My husband made a remark that My legs didn&#x27;t match my arms when I skipped that step lol. (He never notices anything so must of been pretty bad)  One more thing, I spray my legs and arms outside on the back deck, that way the fumes aren&#x27;t as bad and I dry a lot faster in the sun . If you apply in the bathroom, get  in the tub or you will end up with horrible yuck brown on the bottom of your feet where the mist has hit the floor and you cant see it. Hope all this  advice helps. Wish someone would have told me!</li>
            <li> I bought this stuff on sale, and despite all the glowing reviews, I&#x27;m going to say that this is not for everyone...myself included.  I this this product would work really well with a second person involved to apply the product.  Perhaps it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m new to spray-on tans, but my results were disappointing and embarrassing.  I only sprayed this on my legs.  I was sure to exfoliate and shave.  I sprayed as evenly as I could.  The color was lovely, but blotchy...I had white patches here and there.  Worst of all, though, was that the product dripped, and I didn&#x27;t realize it.  The next day, my calves were white except for the drip marks running down them, and my heels and arches of my feet had pools of super-dark \\&quot;tan\\&quot; on them.  It looked awful.  After reading up some, I&#x27;m going to switch to Fake Bake.  That product is rubbed on, and has a bronzer so that you can SEE where it&#x27;s being applied.  No worry of drips.  There&#x27;s a great review on there--first one--that gives advice on other products to use to make a perfect tan every time.  Meanwhile, this stuff will go in the garbage.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product on sale at Target.  It came with the scrub and two exfoliating gloves.   I used the scrub with the gloves in the bath and then dried off thoroughly.   I then sprayed (very thoroughly) all over my legs and arms and torso. I sprayed over several times.  I was actually worried I would end up using the whole bottle- but didn&#x27;t.   I made sure to hold the spray 6 \\&quot; from my body as the directions said.  If you hold it too close- I can see why some would end up with zebra stripes.  I did not rub it in al all.  I sprayed my hands and rubbed it on my face.  I washed my hands with soap and water right after.  After my face felt dry- I did a quick spray on my face (eyes closed- :)   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Right after I did all this (as it was \\&quot;developing\\&quot;)- I came on this site and read all the bad reviews of this product. I  was terrified I&#x27;d end up looking like a zebra like the other posters.  I didn&#x27;t.  It turned out great!  I cannot find one spot that looks weird.  I&#x27;m shocked how easy it is.  Now- I do have olive skin to begin with- so this may be why it was so easy for me.  All I can say to those who end up with lines is that you might be holding the bottle too close when  you spray. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never done self tanner before- but this product is excellent and I&#x27;ll use it again an again!</li>
            <li> I have mediam light asian skin tone, and wanted to find something that would give me that bronzy look for summer without the fear of skin damage from uv rays. I found this at Rite aid after reading a few reviews for it, and decided to get it. I put some on both legs just to test it out. My right leg turned out perfect, my left leg had streaks and blotchs that were orange, a totally different color than my right. I used a scrubing facial wipe and cleaned up the spots and resprayed it. After which it looked a better. so this is a half way good product , its just that you need to practice to get it right. Make sure you get a light mist over the area not a spray. The mist should cover evenly. Try not to spray in one area too much. Just a tip for those with stretch marks and really light skin, this actually makes them more visable not hidden so take it easy in those areas.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping love that it is steak free</li>
            <li> It was my sister&#x27;s wedding, and I noticed that my pale skin on my dark lavender dress would not be very attractive. So a couple of weeks before the weekend, I decided to test the color of this on a  large section of my leg. In about two hours, I noticed that spot had turned as orange as the bottle. I put it in my medicine cabinet and never took it out again.&lt;br /&gt;I would NOT recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I loved this product on top of my &amp;#34;somewhat&amp;#34; tanned body from the sun.  If you don&#x27;t mind maintenance, your tan is going to be awesome.  I couldn&#x27;t get used to the daily routine of it but I was very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product.  Excellent buying experience.  Prompt shipping.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> First of all, like everyone else, I spent time researching sunless tan products before I purchased. I was reluctant like most people but now I am in love!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My tan didn&#x27;t come out with even a hint of orange. As a matter of fact, it looks incredibly real! Here&#x27;s the scoop on the orange color people get when they spray tan: if you are using a product with a high amount of DHA (that&#x27;s what makes your skin tan), and you are pasty white and normally burn, you will probably get an orange hue. Pick the right level for your skin tone. Of course we all want a deep dark tan fast but if you&#x27;re not using the right product for your skin tone, you will turn orange. I do not have even a hint of orange! It&#x27;s a brown/bronzish hue. Love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, to get the nice medium tan I have now, from the ghost- white legs I had before I started with, it took 4 applications. I did rub the first two applications in. The next two, I just sprayed and left it. I do recommend spraying enough to get your skin a tiny bit wet and then let air dry. I&#x27;m not so sure rubbing it in helped at all, although I still tanned one shade rubbing it in. Each layer seemed to give me about 2 shades of tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if you apply during the day, it&#x27;s the next day that you will see the entire difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, people have mentioned the stickiness. I noticed it too, but I liked it because it let me know when for instance my thighs were touching or my elbows were on my knees, which I feel like kept me from smearing my tan so I really can&#x27;t complain about it. When you&#x27;re completely dry, the stickiness is gone, but it will last several hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be patient with this product. Use as instructed. Oh, and I exfoliated my entire body before application and the next morning before I added more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend getting two bottles if you are really light skinned and want a dark tan, put on layers slowly, be patient and let your tan build up. I used almost a full bottle to getto the base tan I wanted. The second bottle will be my maintenance bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I said though, I am in love!</li>
            <li> this stuff is amazing. It&#x27;s the middle of winter, I&#x27;m sick of looking pale and washed out, and I really don&#x27;t want cancer from tanning, thanks. So I have never used sunless tanners, I was always afraid of ending up looking like an oompa-loompa. That said, I was pretty nervous to try this. WELL, neutrogena really knows their stuff. Everyone told me the 2 days after I applied it how tan I looked (mind you, I did like 3 coats, so I looked like I had stepped off a cruise ship). Don&#x27;t go overboard like I did, only use one coat! And I look tan, NOT orange.</li>
            <li> I have very light skin, too, and wanted to look tanned - I rarely tan in the sun, but burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I researched and bought this product. I had the same results as other light skinned reviewers - the results were not even on all body parts - my face, neck, upper chest, lower arms tanned. My shoulders, legs, and rest of trunk were white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8 hours later when I resprayed the legs, I noted the results the next day: the results were patchy - parts that usually can tan turned orange, while areas that rarely tan stayed white - I had orange spotted legs. BUT a shower mellowed out the color and practically made it disappear - I thought this product was supposed to last a few days? Lucky for me it did not. Even my can tanned areas faded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doubt I&#x27;ll take another chance on this product.</li>
            <li> I was not impressed. After using a variety of drugstore spray tanners, this one is by far the worst I&#x27;ve used. First, it smells awful, like hairspray. Second, it streaks. Third, the \\&quot;deep\\&quot; color barely showed up on my fairly pale skin (which actually worked out to my advantage, since then you could not really see the streaking, since the \\&quot;deep\\&quot; color was just barely darker than my skin). It&#x27;s not worth the $11. I&#x27;m sticking with Hawaiian Topics Sunless Tanning lotion. More bang for your buck.</li>
            <li> I have very pale white skin tone and bought the 3 shades darker version and love it. You just have to work out how to best apply it on you to get the results you want.     The first time I went to use it I got the dreaded orange stripes.  -Caused by spraying to close and spraying straight down my leg in sections. But after showering and exfoliating and reapplying, especially to the areas I missed before, it looked much better.      Now one week later I look like I have a real tan.  I bought another bottle today as I will keep using this. I live in Alaska and even if I wasn&#x27;t already anti-tanning I would still never manage to get a real tan up here so this product is perfect for me!    Smells nice too (well much better than other spray tans anyway) but it does get really \\&quot;foggy\\&quot; in the bathroom when you spray it so be warned.</li>
            <li> I have light colored skin and have used this product over the summer to maintain a tan look without the damage from sun.  I think it&#x27;s super easy to use.  I take a shower scrubbing my skin really well, dry off and immediately spray it on.  I started out with a very light mist and have gradually increased the amount I apply.  It looks completely natural and I have received compliments on how great I look.  I like the smell and the feel of the product too.  My only complaint is that it makes my skin itchy immediately after application, however, I&#x27;ve found that if I apply lotion after it dries, the itch is gone.  I highly recommend giving it a go!</li>
            <li> This is the best not-super-expensive tanning spray I&#x27;ve found. Very realistic tone and has better/finer mist than competitors (like L&#x27;Oreal, which is my second-fave). For the most realistic fake tan at home, I&#x27;ll spend $30-$40 on a lotion tanner with bronzer. This is the only way I&#x27;ve found to really get a realistic level of red that makes a tan look absolutely authentic at a &amp;#34;dark&amp;#34; level. However, for regular use, I don&#x27;t have time to deal with bronzer rubbing off everywhere -- that&#x27;s why this is perfect. I use every few days, and the bottle lasts me for a couple weeks. Make sure to rub the spray in well with your hands, and then WASH YOUR HANDS with soap and water. It&#x27;s easy to only wash your fingers and end up with tanning stains on your upper wrist/lower palm area. If this happens, it&#x27;s actually not that hard to rub away any streaks or unwanted pigmentation with a towel. Don&#x27;t just spray your face directly -- spray into your cupped palm, rub your hands together, and rub all over your face like moisturizer. Takes maybe 4 hours to develop color. Definitely take a shower to rinse off excess before sleeping in light-colored sheets, though. Also, I am a dude, so I like that this just smells like pure DHA (the active ingredient in all self-tanners) and doesn&#x27;t smell like strawberry unicorns or whatever.&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is if you go really overboard, your skin will look too yellow. So don&#x27;t try to get a &amp;#34;dark&amp;#34; tan out of this - it&#x27;s perfect for a moderate look.</li>
            <li> This is not what I expected. It smelled really strong. I buy this brand at rite aid and it is a little different. I didn&#x27;t end up using this after using it once.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a cheaper option than JWOWW&#x27;s. Did not turn me any darker.I would not waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> I love the sprayer on the product- it delivers the product evenly and guaranteed to be streak free :-) this vendor is always amazing - received products sooner than predicted .</li>
            <li> Container did not spray</li>
            <li> Before buying this product I read the other reviews. Being red haired and blue eyed I generally purchase self-tanning products for fair or light skin.  After reading reviews I went ahead and ordered the Neutrogena deep. Excellent results! I was shocked that the spray covered so well and did not leave streaks. Even more impressive- it wasn&#x27;t orange!!  It looked like a beautiful brown beach tan. The other wonderful selling point was it will spray when the can is upside down. That means easy application to the middle of your back! I hate having to recruit my husband or kids to help me with tanning myself!  This was an excellent product and I felt like I got my money&#x27;s worth - plus!</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t wast your money</li>
            <li> The fragrance could be better; smells a bit cheap.  To avoid staining the floor, cabinets, or rugs, make sure you apply it in an enclosed shower or bathtub, or even outside if not windy.</li>
            <li> No streaks, no send, didn&#x27;t stain my clothing! Spray and rub in! I did it after I showered and rubbed it in with jergens! It looks great! Sun kissed glow!</li>
            <li> I tried this product twice, and the first time I thought maybe it was something else I reacted to.  But I just tried a new bottle and its given me the worst bumpy rash on the legs and arms and upper chest.  I used it last thursday and 4 days later and I still have a severe itchy rash.  What a mess !  Its taking a long time to go away.  My suggestion is to test a SMALL area and wait a couple days.</li>
            <li> Horrible......the medium sunless spray is much better,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The deep streaks and is orange....waste of money.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It goes on evenly and lasts. With the deep you do have to be more careful than with the medium shade because it will get orange if you put on too many layers. AS with pretty much all self tanners you also have to be mindful of what you&#x27;re wearing if you have applied and haven&#x27;t showered yet as it will rub off on clothing. I have tried St. Tropez self tanners (foam, gel, lotion you name it) and many other brands and always come back to this one!</li>
