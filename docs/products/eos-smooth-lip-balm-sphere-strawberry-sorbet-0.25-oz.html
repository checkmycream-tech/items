            <li>This stuff is awesome!  </li>
            <li>Tastes great too!</li>
            <li>This bundle is a great deal, and an awesome way to stock up!</li>
            <li>the size is perfect, and the smell is really good for girls.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So manly men, and beautiful women, we have found the lip balm to end all lip balms.</li>
            <li>Sure, the price per unit is a bit steeper than with the 5-pack at Costco, but this is the perfect place to get a three pack of the best flavor--and none of the undesirable ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great lip balm.</li>

            <li>It smells nice, tastes good, keeps my lips permanently kissable, and doesn&#x27;t go on like I&#x27;m applying lipstick--</li>
            <li>I introduced it at work and they love it too!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>and I make sure I always have one with me!</li>
            <li>Love My eos lip balm!</li>
            <li>So if you love delicious fruity flavors, and you want soft lips, BUY EOS!!!!!</li>
            <li>It smells nice</li>
            <li>I also like it a lot goes on smooth and has a really good scent and feel.</li>
            <li>Great moisturizing lip balm stays for hours and really does taste like strawberry!</li>
            <li>Even if you just carry it around and apply it every once and awhile, it makes a huge difference!</li>
            <li>but this one is lovely.</li>
            <li>Much better price than we can get in town.</li>
            <li>I think there are better moisturizing lip balms out there that work better.</li>
            <li>it is very nice and fast shipping .I</li>
            <li>a non-statistical survey of beautiful women who used EOS lip balms, Strawberry Sorbet has been, by far, the favorite flavor.  </li>
            <li>Delicious taste and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>My kids think these are cool!  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and find in your drawer or purse.</li>
            <li>It tastes great, and keeps my lips soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>The packaging was a bit bent, but the product itself was fine.</li>
            <li>Of all the flavors, I really enjoy:</li>
            <li>really fragrant, kind of like bonnie bell for grown ups.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s not to say I won&#x27;t go back to using Chapstick, but for now, I&#x27;m delighted to use EOS.</li>
            <li>Strawberry Sorbet, Tangerine, Sweet Mint, and Pomegranate</li>
            <li>(Honeydew and Sweet Mint were close seconds.)  </li>
            <li>This chapstick in this flavor is my absolute favorite.</li>
            <li>of all, they work great and each application stays on/lasts for a long time, if you can resist licking the real tasty flavored ones.</li>
            <li>As a male who likes to consider himself rather masculine, I can say that this is a great lip balm.  </li>
            <li>i do wish it had spf, but the fun flavors, colors, and shape do make it fun.</li>
            <li>This EOS lip balm was clearly designed for the purse, as it does not fit into trouser pockets particularly well, but the cool sphere looks great on a desk top.  </li>
            <li>Using this to prep my dry lips before lipstick feel exactly like prepping my lips and my lipstick would still kind of &amp;#34;hug&amp;#34; my lips but without the flaky skin.</li>
            <li>I put it on every night before bed and it really helps!</li>
            <li>An added bonus is that the shape allows me to find this stuff in my purse, no matter how much other junk is piled on top of it!</li>
            <li>Lastly, the regular EOS Lip Balms are 95% organic, 100% natural, and paraben and petrolatum free - and full of healthy ingredients.</li>
            <li>no dude wants to look like he is putting on lipstick.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it is very moisturizing</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t like the balm that much.</li>
            <li>I actually bought this for my 8 and 9 year old nieces, they love this product.</li>
            <li>Using them before lipstick also feels like the lipstick will just be floating on top and just waiting to slide down my chin.</li>
            <li>Half a second under the sink to get the drool off, and the sphere was good as new.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has just the right amount of strawberry flavor - not enough to interfere with the taste of whatever you&#x27;re eating or drinking (unlike the passion fruit one, which changes the taste of EVERYTHING).  </li>
            <li>Sure, unscrewing a pink egg and rubbing it on my lips raises some eyebrows at the office, but that just makes it a conversation piece...and makes me the coolest guy for a ten cubicle radius.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not icky, not heavy</li>
            <li>All other lip balms, when they dry up on my lips, would leave my lips kind of crusty with skin on top and would definitely feel worse than before I applied them.</li>
            <li>This stuff is never greasy, and one of these really does last a long while even for the chronic users like myself.</li>
            <li>others don&#x27;t like the other flavors or colors as much.</li>
            <li>i do like the sphere application, but it not easy to travel with, its not exactly pocket friendly and doesn&#x27;t fit well in a small clutch.</li>
            <li>She is much happier with these than her previous brand.</li>
            <li>I used to swear by the Rosebud Strawberry lip balm, which is slightly more expensive, but EOS is ever-so-slightly less greasy going on, serves as a fantastic base for lipsticks, does well on its own, and has a lower price point.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> Very nice smelling and soothing on lips. Easy to use and find in your drawer or purse. Not too crazy about the other fragrances but this one is lovely.</li>
            <li> smooth and delicious. this product will always in my bag. the size is perfect, and the smell is really good for girls.</li>
            <li> My entire family has one. Not sticky.</li>
            <li> I ordered these and gave away as little gifts.  everyone loves them.  I am sticking with the strawberry.  others don&#x27;t like the other flavors or colors as much.</li>
            <li> Grabbed a set for my friends. They came in 3 separate single units. The packaging was a bit bent, but the product itself was fine. Good deal.</li>
            <li> I discovered the EOS Lip Balm after seeing two different people using it, at different times, hundreds of miles apart, within a short period of time. I was immediately drawn to its uniqueness and as soon as I had a chance, I did an online search to see what the name of the product was and found it on Amazon. I am an admitted lip balm addict and I must have one in every room, in the car, on my person, and in my carry-all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been a staunch Chapstick user for years, but since finding EOS, I have been using it, exclusively. That&#x27;s not to say I won&#x27;t go back to using Chapstick, but for now, I&#x27;m delighted to use EOS. I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a number of flavors. There is also a medicated EOS, in Tangerine and an SPF 15 UVA/UVB protection EOS, in Lemon Drop. Of all the flavors, I really enjoy: Strawberry Sorbet, Tangerine, Sweet Mint, and Pomegranate Raspberry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best of all, they work great and each application stays on/lasts for a long time, if you can resist licking the real tasty flavored ones. Lastly, the regular EOS Lip Balms are 95% organic, 100% natural, and paraben and petrolatum free - and full of healthy ingredients.</li>
            <li> So does my husband and Grandkids!  This stuff is awesome!  I introduced it at work and they love it too!</li>
            <li> I actually bought this for my 8 and 9 year old nieces, they love this product. I also like it a lot goes on smooth and has a really good scent and feel.</li>

            <li> so beautiful love it I want to order again but I dont know why they dont ship it to saudi arabia !!</li>
            <li> I like this product it&#x27;s moisturizing and tastes good. It has nice packaging, not the best chapstick/ lip balm I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Great smell, 95% organic I believe. Feels great. Lots of product. I would recommend this to others. I would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> It smells nice but I didn&#x27;t like the balm that much. I think there are better moisturizing lip balms out there that work better.</li>
            <li> Beautiful and good quality product, recommended.</li>
            <li> This chapstick in this flavor is my absolute favorite. It tastes great, and keeps my lips soft and smooth. An added bonus is that the shape allows me to find this stuff in my purse, no matter how much other junk is piled on top of it! This stuff is never greasy, and one of these really does last a long while even for the chronic users like myself. This bundle is a great deal, and an awesome way to stock up!</li>
            <li> Not icky, not heavy, doesn&#x27;t feel like you need anything, and it truly works!!!! All other lip balms, when they dry up on my lips, would leave my lips kind of crusty with skin on top and would definitely feel worse than before I applied them. Using them before lipstick also feels like the lipstick will just be floating on top and just waiting to slide down my chin.

            <li> really fragrant, kind of like bonnie bell for grown ups. i do like the sphere application, but it not easy to travel with, its not exactly pocket friendly and doesn&#x27;t fit well in a small clutch. i do wish it had spf, but the fun flavors, colors, and shape do make it fun. they also last quite some time.</li>
