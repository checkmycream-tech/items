            <li>Works pretty great!</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>This stuff is AMAZING.  </li>
            <li>Amazing results.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m amazed and thrilled.</li>
            <li>Luckily I did my research and came across this product and saw all the great reviews and purchased a tube.</li>
            <li>Be sure to apply a layer of Vaseline after putting the Ilex on so the diaper doesn&#x27;t stick.</li>
            <li>Tried triple paste, desitin, butt paste, cornstarch, Vaseline, coconut oil, mother love diaper cream, etc.</li>
            <li>Do add more Vaseline.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s nothing better.</li>
            <li>I had better luck with Aquafor.</li>
            <li>This stuff is magic.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t matter how many times we changed him or how urgently the soiled diaper was addressed, there was no helping control the rash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nothing better</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t forget to put aquafor or petroleum on top</li>
            <li>Once I&#x27;m healed, Calmoseptine is my choice to sustain healthy skin.  </li>
            <li>Do not remove the paste when you change the diaper either or it could hurt the skin more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used so many products, its to many to count.</li>
            <li>Recommended to me by a skin care nurse practitioner and I&#x27;m so glad I got some.</li>
            <li>We tried desitin, a&amp;d, triple paste, aquafor, plus prescription creams too, on top of keeping her diaper free for over a week (what fun that was!!</li>
            <li>There is a huge difference in the two products.</li>
            <li>He wouldn&#x27;t even be able to sit up because it hurt him so much!</li>
            <li>My pediatrician recommended layering Nystatin underneath the ILEx to prevent  yeast developing in the open wound and it was wonderfully successful.</li>
            <li>It was ok if the paste has poopy on it just allow it to remain there and apply more if necessary.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you put a nice thick layer of vaseline over top the paste after you apply it.</li>
            <li>Not as easy to use as stuff like triple paste, calmoseptine or criticaid, but when his butt gets really irritated, this is our go to.</li>
            <li>Works great at protecting our little guy&#x27;s irritated skin.  </li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>Dr. also suggested putting petroleum jelly or something similar on top of the iLEX to help prevent sticking to diaper or clothing, but I haven&#x27;t done that and haven&#x27;t had any issues with it sticking to anything but his skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like second skin but better.</li>
            <li>, the next day it was so much better</li>
            <li>Excellent product, although difficult to get from pharmacies - I order 2 or 3 at a time in order to get it.</li>
            <li>Butt Burn will know exactly what I&#x27;m talking about.  </li>
            <li>if your kiddo has a yeast rash,  apply antifungal first.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s rare I get emotional in thanking someone for a product, but with Ilex, it is justified.</li>
            <li>What seemed to help keep the rash under control was changing the diaper super frequently</li>
            <li>let it dry for about 60 seconds,  and then apply a barrier cream of your choice over the top.  </li>
            <li>I live by this stuff!!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>A lot to pay for something that doesn&#x27;t really work...</li>
            <li>Thank you so much.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have much hope for this nor did any one we knew heard of or had experience with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use baby wipes on his bottom so much.</li>
            <li>Ilex work so fast</li>
            <li>My babies are very thankful.</li>
            <li>I almost spent several sleepless nights researching on diaper rash, but surprisingly this product wasn&#x27;t put up in a lot of online forums, but it should be.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;d tried many other creams but nothing else worked except Ilex.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>far as the shipper, this stuff came fast.</li>
            <li>It does stick to the skin, though, but when applying it, you have to make sure the area has been thoroughly dried; no wetness from wipes or whatever cleaning method you use after diaper change.  </li>
            <li>The skin kind of turned black which worried me, but is now healing back to normal.</li>
            <li>iLEX has been a life saver for myself and others who live with a J-Pouch.  </li>
            <li>The rash is nearly completely HEALED!  </li>
            <li>Good to have on hand if your baby gets a severe diaper rash with raw skin where other creams won&#x27;t stick to it.</li>
            <li>Only thing that would work quickly on his diaper rash and actually create a barrier for the skin while healing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Finally just within 2 days of applying Ilex, the blisters were completely gone.</li>
            <li>Another tip for babies with rashes or with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I put the coconut oil in an old baby food jar and carry it in his diaper bag.</li>
            <li>*a lot* as much as an hour or later after a feeding.</li>
            <li>I ordered the cream and it arrived on a Friday - you could see progress by the hour, in 2 days the sores close and now, after 4 days of using it, she s almost completely healed.</li>
            <li>I also used it for my 1 year old&#x27;s G-tube site while we were waiting for it to heal.</li>
            <li>It is well worth the money since you only have to use a tiny bit.</li>
            <li>Make sure to apply the barrier cream thick,  like frosting a cake, to keep the ilex from adhering to the diaper itself.  </li>
            <li>I may use the baby wipes when it gets really messy but make sure they are completely dry before you put the Ilex on.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much so it lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li>By far my favorite diaper cream, mix 1/3 desitin, 1/3 A&amp;D ointment and 1/3 ilex, clears up the worst diaper rash super fast!!!</li>
            <li>One down side is removing the sticky substance, it does come off fairly easy with a flushable wet wipe.  </li>
            <li>(was not easy to do due to his pain), put antibiotic ointment on the wounds (Neosporin with pain relief) and iLEX on top (per doctor&#x27;s instructions).  </li>
            <li>My 8 month old baby brother recently had a stoma reversal surgery and thankfully recovered well...</li>
            <li>I have tried nearly everything on the market and ilex is the only one that stays where it&#x27;t put.</li>
            <li>For example, I didnt change his diaper for nine hours over the course of the night, he pooped at least three times and his butt was smooth like a diaper commercial in the morning.</li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s been far and few between thanks to this product.</li>
            <li>Nothing worked and most only made it worse.</li>
            <li>The results were unbelievable - his bottom had improved miraculously in the first 24 hours!</li>
            <li>The only negative thing I&#x27;ve noticed is that it seems to amplify the odoriferous eminations of poo, but that&#x27;s much more tolerable than seeing the little guy in agony over open diaper rash wounds.  </li>

            <li> Little one was more compliant with diaper changes and a few days later you could barely tell there was any trouble there at all.  </li>
            <li> Since his skin never had any poop on it until he was a year old, so his skin was extremely irritated since it wasn&#x27;t used to the feces.  </li>
            <li> It will dry into very stick gummy goo after a few hours or so which is no big deal.</li>
            <li> Long story short he got a diaper rash that bled!</li>
            <li> I use toilet paper with coconut oil</li>
            <li> I was struggling to cure a rash on my newborn, which started at 2 weeks and refused to go away for almost 7 long weeks, until I discovered Ilex.</li>
            <li> Apply the paste thick, not thin or rub it in.</li>
            <li> I had tried every cream suggested by folks like Aquaphor, A+D, Desitin, Triple Paste, Monkey Butt paste, Burt&#x27;s bees, Bag Balm, etc and even doc recommended Hydrocortisone, and plain old coconut oil and corn starch.</li>
            <li> If your little one has ferocious, angry diaper rash causing anguish, this will work better than anything else you can try.  </li>
            <li> Unlike all the other zinc-oxide creams out there, iLEX is the only one that completely keeps out moisture and has a quick soothing and healing property, especially for those troublesome times when dealing with painful anal fissures.</li>
            <li> so it won&#x27;t dry and flake and don&#x27;t peel it off.</li>
            <li> Skin must be completely dry before application,  </li>
            <li> Let dry.  </li>
            <li> Let dry.  </li>
            <li> You have to dry the area, apply a thin coat, let dry for 30 seconds, and put a thick cost of Vaseline on top to keep it from sticking to the diaper or itself.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been less than a week since we&#x27;ve been using this on him and his rash has finally cleared up.</li>
            <li> In no less than 36 hours was the rash completely healed, there were zero traces of broken skin or that there was any issue down there at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li> She had 2 long raw red rashes (one on each butt cheek), and since she was also pooping a lot during this period, no amount of cream could heal it.</li>
            <li> I dip a piece of the toilet paper in there and wipe him down.</li>
            <li> My parents and I tried every single diaper rash cream to save his bum (Desitin, Boudreaux&#x27;s Butt Paste, Calmoseptine, endless home remedies...) to save his irritated bottom.</li>
            <li> She ended up with a round burn like spot that was bleeding and open.</li>
            <li> This paste allowed the broken skin to heal so quickly it was unbelievable.</li>
            <li> It protected the skin around the site from irritation due to stomach acid and food continually leaking out.</li>
            <li> Love it, recommended to anyone who has a little one with a bad rash.</li>
            <li> A couple of times our twins had diaper rashes where their rashes would slightly bleed.</li>
            <li> After a little research my wife came upon Ilex.</li>
            <li> Once received, we gave him baking soda bath in lukewarm water, dried him well</li>
            <li> Put it on every diaper change and use a thin coat only.</li>
            <li> Pediatrician called dermatology and told us to try to find this online since it&#x27;s pretty much impossible to find in any store or pharmacy.  </li>
            <li> Would definitely recommend to anyone who knows of a baby with a serious diaper rash!</li>
            <li> No more screaming diaper changes.  </li>
            <li> It usually lasts me about a month.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found just a small dime size amount is needed.  </li>
            <li> Little one had a very angry diaper rash that turned into open wounds, bleeding and all.  </li>
            <li> It needs to be thick like wood putty if that makes sense.</li>
            <li> twins boy and girl; boy got diaper rash so bad from a digestive issue that resulted in raw skin and open sores.</li>
            <li> My newborn daughter had serious butt rash, where no butt paste would seem to work.  </li>
            <li> but he had a serious diaper rash.</li>
            <li> My baby had pretty bad diaper rash after being on antibiotics:( with some raw areas and a NICU nurse recommended using ILEX.</li>
            <li> Yes it&#x27;s expensive and messy (resembles rubber glue), but it works so who cares?!</li>
            <li> Imagine applying rubber cement glue to your poor baby&#x27;s tushy...</li>
            <li> It does seem that it may discolor the baby&#x27;s behind, but that seems to go away once you stop using it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t think about it, just get it and help that poor child already!</li>
            <li> My son was bloody raw with a diaper rash one day, then after 8 hours of ILEX was compeltely healed.</li>
            <li> It was so painful, he&#x27;d refuse diaper changes by clenching shut, kicking, screaming, trying to roll away from the torture of cleaning such an excruciatingly painful area.  </li>
            <li> My newborn son has bad reflux, so he can spit up</li>
            <li> This is what you use when you have severe rashes so bad that a cream cannot touch it.</li>
            <li> My daughter gets bad diaper rashes and when the tiniest amount of poop touches her bottom, she screams.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been desperate for days to stop my daughters horrible excoriated bum from getting worse and hadn&#x27;t found anything to help!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> She has a horrible rash and we tried everything to heal it.</li>

            <li> This stuff is amazing! Be sure to apply a layer of Vaseline after putting the Ilex on so the diaper doesn&#x27;t stick. Use for about 2-3 days and the diaper rash is gone...completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the shipper, this stuff came fast. Order said it would be there in 4-5 days, got it in 2.</li>
            <li> Does not stay on skin, even when using with petroleum jelly.  And, I will not be using it in the future.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait to write a review for this product!!! I&#x27;ve been desperate for days to stop my daughters horrible excoriated bum from getting worse and hadn&#x27;t found anything to help! Tried triple paste, desitin, butt paste, cornstarch, Vaseline, coconut oil, mother love diaper cream, etc. Nothing worked and most only made it worse. She ended up with a round burn like spot that was bleeding and open. I did some research and found ilex. Ordered it and have been putting it on since last night. The rash is nearly completely HEALED!  I&#x27;m amazed and thrilled. Yes it&#x27;s expensive and messy (resembles rubber glue), but it works so who cares?! You have to dry the area, apply a thin coat, let dry for 30 seconds, and put a thick cost of Vaseline on top to keep it from sticking to the diaper or itself. Then just wipe the Vaseline layer off with diaper changes. It will be chunky and you will want to pick it off. Don&#x27;t. Just put another layer on where it&#x27;s come off and leave the rest alone. Do add more Vaseline.  It won&#x27;t block the anus so put it wherever you need it.  It&#x27;s our miracle. Thank you Ilex!</li>
            <li> Works great at protecting our little guy&#x27;s irritated skin.  Not as easy to use as stuff like triple paste, calmoseptine or criticaid, but when his butt gets really irritated, this is our go to.</li>
            <li> I have a J-pouch. I live by this stuff!! There&#x27;s nothing better.</li>
            <li> Little one had a very angry diaper rash that turned into open wounds, bleeding and all.  It was so painful, he&#x27;d refuse diaper changes by clenching shut, kicking, screaming, trying to roll away from the torture of cleaning such an excruciatingly painful area.  Pediatrician called dermatology and told us to try to find this online since it&#x27;s pretty much impossible to find in any store or pharmacy.  Once received, we gave him baking soda bath in lukewarm water, dried him well (was not easy to do due to his pain), put antibiotic ointment on the wounds (Neosporin with pain relief) and iLEX on top (per doctor&#x27;s instructions).  Wounds stopped bleeding the next day.  Little one was more compliant with diaper changes and a few days later you could barely tell there was any trouble there at all.  No more screaming diaper changes.  Dr. also suggested putting petroleum jelly or something similar on top of the iLEX to help prevent sticking to diaper or clothing, but I haven&#x27;t done that and haven&#x27;t had any issues with it sticking to anything but his skin.  It does stick to the skin, though, but when applying it, you have to make sure the area has been thoroughly dried; no wetness from wipes or whatever cleaning method you use after diaper change.  The only negative thing I&#x27;ve noticed is that it seems to amplify the odoriferous eminations of poo, but that&#x27;s much more tolerable than seeing the little guy in agony over open diaper rash wounds.  If your little one has ferocious, angry diaper rash causing anguish, this will work better than anything else you can try.  Don&#x27;t think about it, just get it and help that poor child already!</li>
            <li> Amazing product! Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> A lot to pay for something that doesn&#x27;t really work... It is sticky enough to annoy but not to stay in place which is the purpose of it (to act as a barrier while the skin heals). My baby had pretty bad diaper rash after being on antibiotics:( with some raw areas and a NICU nurse recommended using ILEX. No pharmacy carried it so I had to order it online, it was pricey and took a week to arrive, and didn&#x27;t help at all!!! Imagine applying rubber cement glue to your poor baby&#x27;s tushy... I had better luck with Aquafor.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the only thing that helps my son with his severe diaper rash. I don&#x27;t know what I would do without it.</li>
            <li> This product has been the difference in giving my son a good quality of life. I was told that with his condition, a red sore rashy and even bleeding bum would be his norm. But that&#x27;s been far and few between thanks to this product. It&#x27;s rare I get emotional in thanking someone for a product, but with Ilex, it is justified. Thank you to the company that made this. Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> This stuff is magic. If your baby is prone to diaper rash this is a great way to heal and prevent. It&#x27;s like second skin but better. Worth the price.</li>
            <li> I have to have this stuff!  It adheres to damp or irritated skin so I use it on the area around my g-tube to keep inflammation away.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to throw around words like &amp;#34;amazing&amp;#34; but this product truly is nothing short of amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have twins boy and girl; boy got diaper rash so bad from a digestive issue that resulted in raw skin and open sores. It didn&#x27;t matter how many times we changed him or how urgently the soiled diaper was addressed, there was no helping control the rash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pediatrician called in a script of some antibacterial cream which did nothing aside from taking $30 from my wallet. After a little research my wife came upon Ilex. I didn&#x27;t have much hope for this nor did any one we knew heard of or had experience with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Received the tube on a Saturday morning and within 12 hours the rash had almost entirely cleared! The child was no longer screaming in pain every time he had a movement and we were not frantically changing and caring for his sore bum. In no less than 36 hours was the rash completely healed, there were zero traces of broken skin or that there was any issue down there at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy this stuff and a tube of petroleum jelly. If you have a newborn or infant--whether or not he has a diaper rash or not--do yourself and your child a favor and buy this.</li>
            <li> The product work great I will continue to order this product.</li>
            <li> Would give it 10 stars!! I was struggling to cure a rash on my newborn, which started at 2 weeks and refused to go away for almost 7 long weeks, until I discovered Ilex. She had 2 long raw red rashes (one on each butt cheek), and since she was also pooping a lot during this period, no amount of cream could heal it. I had tried every cream suggested by folks like Aquaphor, A+D, Desitin, Triple Paste, Monkey Butt paste, Burt&#x27;s bees, Bag Balm, etc and even doc recommended Hydrocortisone, and plain old coconut oil and corn starch. Nothing worked!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally just within 2 days of applying Ilex, the blisters were completely gone. The skin kind of turned black which worried me, but is now healing back to normal. Thank you Ilex!! I almost spent several sleepless nights researching on diaper rash, but surprisingly this product wasn&#x27;t put up in a lot of online forums, but it should be.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. I have been using this on my son since he had his reversal colostomy done. It was recommended by his surgeon. Since his skin never had any poop on it until he was a year old, so his skin was extremely irritated since it wasn&#x27;t used to the feces.  If I go a diaper change without using it, he gets a rash. But once I put this stuff on, it&#x27;s gone by the next day. Put it on every diaper change and use a thin coat only. Then put a bit of Vaseline over it to keep it from sticking and rubbing off in the diaper. Another tip for babies with rashes or with sensitive skin. I don&#x27;t use baby wipes on his bottom so much. I use toilet paper with coconut oil and I see that it helps a lot. I put the coconut oil in an old baby food jar and carry it in his diaper bag. I dip a piece of the toilet paper in there and wipe him down. I may use the baby wipes when it gets really messy but make sure they are completely dry before you put the Ilex on. He never gets rashes now. I recommend this stuff to everyone I know that has a baby with a rash. It is well worth the money since you only have to use a tiny bit. It usually lasts me about a month.</li>
            <li> best paste for my daughter&#x27;s diaper rash.  nothing else works!  her skin breaks open, which is why this works so well</li>
            <li> this stuff is practically science fiction. It turns into a sort of hydrogel looking layer that totally protects the skin.  My newborn son has bad reflux, so he can spit up *a lot* as much as an hour or later after a feeding. He also poops after almost every feeding. Long story short he got a diaper rash that bled! I found a suggestion for this on an internet forum and I am blown away! For example, I didnt change his diaper for nine hours over the course of the night, he pooped at least three times and his butt was smooth like a diaper commercial in the morning.</li>
            <li> This was the only stuff that would work on my daughter. She has a horrible rash and we tried everything to heal it. Nothing worked and she was in pain every time we change her. Ilex work so fast, the next day it was so much better and she wasn&#x27;t in pain anymore. Love it, recommended to anyone who has a little one with a bad rash.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, although difficult to get from pharmacies - I order 2 or 3 at a time in order to get it. This is the only product my son who had an ostomy 4 years ago can use.</li>
            <li> By far my favorite diaper cream, mix 1/3 desitin, 1/3 A&amp;D ointment and 1/3 ilex, clears up the worst diaper rash super fast!!!</li>
            <li> Is a excellent product I love it</li>
            <li> My newborn daughter had serious butt rash, where no butt paste would seem to work.  This paste was recommended by my pediatrician, and it works great!  It does seem that it may discolor the baby&#x27;s behind, but that seems to go away once you stop using it.</li>
            <li> My 8 month old baby brother recently had a stoma reversal surgery and thankfully recovered well... but he had a serious diaper rash. He wouldn&#x27;t even be able to sit up because it hurt him so much! My parents and I tried every single diaper rash cream to save his bum (Desitin, Boudreaux&#x27;s Butt Paste, Calmoseptine, endless home remedies...) to save his irritated bottom. Luckily I did my research and came across this product and saw all the great reviews and purchased a tube. The results were unbelievable - his bottom had improved miraculously in the first 24 hours! It&#x27;s been less than a week since we&#x27;ve been using this on him and his rash has finally cleared up. Me and my parents use this paste on him and some Vaseline (or non brand name petroleum jelly) since that&#x27;s what the instructions say to use. Would definitely recommend to anyone who knows of a baby with a serious diaper rash! Happy to say that I&#x27;ve already purchased another tube of this and can&#x27;t wait to see it in my mailbox.</li>
            <li> I am so happy to share that this worked for our baby too. We tried desitin, a&amp;d, triple paste, aquafor, plus prescription creams too, on top of keeping her diaper free for over a week (what fun that was!! Would not recommend).  What seemed to help keep the rash under control was changing the diaper super frequently (we were shooting for an hour), but this meant waking the baby up, which meant messing up her sleep schedule. Plus at night we did not have the heart to wake her up , so with changing her every 3-4 hours by the AM the redness would come back. Even if with all the creams we used we managed to get the redness under some sort of control, she has open sores, which were bleeding and would not go away. I found a mention about ILEX on a mommy website and started reading about it. I ordered the cream and it arrived on a Friday - you could see progress by the hour, in 2 days the sores close and now, after 4 days of using it, she s almost completely healed. Give it a try if nothing else works for you either. Wishes of health for you and your babies!</li>
            <li> Very good  and effective in healing diaper rash and cuts. My babies are very thankful.</li>
            <li> I recieved ilex skin protectant. Not Ilex skin protectant PASTE as advertised above. There is a huge difference in the two products. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Was given this in the nicu. Only thing that would work quickly on his diaper rash and actually create a barrier for the skin while healing. Nothing better and I can say that after purchasing and spending hundreds on brands at target and Walmart. Don&#x27;t forget to put aquafor or petroleum on top so it won&#x27;t dry and flake and don&#x27;t peel it off.</li>
            <li> iLEX has been a life saver for myself and others who live with a J-Pouch.  This paste is a rubbery substance when it drys and provides an excellent skin protection from digestive acids.  Those J-Pouchers who know the term Butt Burn will know exactly what I&#x27;m talking about.  Unlike all the other zinc-oxide creams out there, iLEX is the only one that completely keeps out moisture and has a quick soothing and healing property, especially for those troublesome times when dealing with painful anal fissures. I&#x27;ve found just a small dime size amount is needed.  For adults, no petroleum jelly is required.  Once I&#x27;m healed, Calmoseptine is my choice to sustain healthy skin.  One down side is removing the sticky substance, it does come off fairly easy with a flushable wet wipe.  I&#x27;ll deal with sticky anytime, because this stuff works wonders when you&#x27;re hurting.  I only wish they would drop the price some.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed any difference</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING.  Heals severe diaper rash in one day!  Skin must be completely dry before application,  let it dry for about 60 seconds,  and then apply a barrier cream of your choice over the top.  Make sure to apply the barrier cream thick,  like frosting a cake, to keep the ilex from adhering to the diaper itself.  Absolutely wonderful stuff.  Just keep applying without taking off prior application.  Amazing results.  Nothing else worked for us,  and we tried EVERYTHING.  side note :  if your kiddo has a yeast rash,  apply antifungal first.  Let dry.  Then ilex.  Let dry.  Then barrier cream.  The rash well be gone in 24-48 hrs!</li>
            <li> This product is the only thing I have found that protects the skin around my ostomy. I have tried nearly everything on the market and ilex is the only one that stays where it&#x27;t put.</li>
            <li> This product was used on our premie twins while in the NICU for two months. The NICU nurses called it miracle paste because it allowed diaper rash to heal within a day or two. A couple of times our twins had diaper rashes where their rashes would slightly bleed. This paste allowed the broken skin to heal so quickly it was unbelievable. Just make sure you put a nice thick layer of vaseline over top the paste after you apply it. Apply the paste thick, not thin or rub it in. It needs to be thick like wood putty if that makes sense. Do not remove the paste when you change the diaper either or it could hurt the skin more. It was ok if the paste has poopy on it just allow it to remain there and apply more if necessary. It seems gross but that is how it works. It will dry into very stick gummy goo after a few hours or so which is no big deal. This product is nothin like any diaper rash cream. It is not a diaper rash cream but a skin protectant rather. This is what you use when you have severe rashes so bad that a cream cannot touch it. It is a must in your medicine cabinet. Also used on burn victims. Excellent product. We still use it to this day for any rashes that might appear.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! My daughter gets bad diaper rashes and when the tiniest amount of poop touches her bottom, she screams. I&#x27;ve used so many products, its to many to count. With the ilex cream, she doesn&#x27;t feel a thing. It protects her bottom and I love it!!</li>
            <li> Love this paste - wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive but it is the only thing that works! I always have it on hand.</li>
            <li> My son was bloody raw with a diaper rash one day, then after 8 hours of ILEX was compeltely healed. I wouldn&#x27;t have believed it if I didn&#x27;t see it myself. Wonderful cream, and worth every penny. My pediatrician recommended layering Nystatin underneath the ILEx to prevent  yeast developing in the open wound and it was wonderfully successful.</li>
            <li> Best cream on the market for severe diaper rush. I also used it for my 1 year old&#x27;s G-tube site while we were waiting for it to heal. It protected the skin around the site from irritation due to stomach acid and food continually leaking out. We&#x27;d tried many other creams but nothing else worked except Ilex. Great product!!! I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Best thing for dipper rash</li>
            <li> We use this product for diaper rash for my son. Works pretty great!</li>
            <li> This helped prevent diaper rash&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> Good to have on hand if your baby gets a severe diaper rash with raw skin where other creams won&#x27;t stick to it. Recommended to me by a skin care nurse practitioner and I&#x27;m so glad I got some. It doesn&#x27;t take much so it lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li> Best cream ever for diaper rash. This with a layer of aquaphor makes an incredible barrier and helped clear up awful diaper rash in days.</li>
