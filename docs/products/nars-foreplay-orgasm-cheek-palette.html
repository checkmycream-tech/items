            <li> My only complaint is that the color doesn&#x27;t seem to be as long lasting as some of my other blushes even with using a primer,  setting spray, and powder.</li>
            <li> I use the gold on my eyelids, and either the peach shimmer on my cheeks with the coral matte on my lips, or the matted pink on my cheeks and lips.</li>
            <li> Not the case with the NARS blush in fact I&#x27;ve tried other brands that I think look nicer.</li>
            <li> I love to use the darker pink for some contouring and the gold for highlights (as well as an eyeshadow base).</li>
            <li> and I was very disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> Oh and the worst part is the price!</li>

            <li> Must have cheek Palette!</li>
            <li> This product offers the same great quality you&#x27;d come to expect from NARS for a discounted price.</li>
            <li> My favorite new cosmetic purchase! All of my favorites in one easy compact! Arrived on time as described!</li>
            <li> True Nars product.  Love it.</li>
            <li> Beautiful, some of the colors work as an eyeshadow, to contour or just as a blush</li>
            <li> Love this palate perfect color!</li>
            <li> The blushes are beautiful and pigmented. They stay on for a while too.</li>
            <li> First time trying Nars blush after hearing a lot of hype. I like the pigment selection in the palette; one color has shimmer, another with a matte finish. The gold is too pigmented for a highlighter so i use it as an eyeshadow. My only complaint is that the color doesn&#x27;t seem to be as long lasting as some of my other blushes even with using a primer,  setting spray, and powder.</li>
            <li> Love Love Love it so much! Love that I can play with the intensity of the colors. I can make it more pink or more coral depending on the look I&#x27;m going for or just keep the classic orgasm. The color is just great! Haven&#x27;t used the highlighter much but still love this palette.</li>
            <li> I love all Nars products, especially the Orgasm line and this does not disappoint. A bit pricey, but worth it in my opinion. The highlighter is really fabulous as well. A great emergency supply on days that you go bare faced, but something unexpectedly comes up and you need some emergency glam.</li>
            <li> This blush palette is lovely.. very smooth and long lasting and is suitable for most skin tones.&lt;br /&gt;Great for traveling!! I will be replacing my travel blush collection with this..</li>
            <li> I love this cheek palette. I have used it daily since I&#x27;ve gotten it. I use the gold on my eyelids, and either the peach shimmer on my cheeks with the coral matte on my lips, or the matted pink on my cheeks and lips. It is a very versatile piece.</li>
            <li> NARS makes my favourite blush by far - and this palette does not disappoint. It comes with the ever amazing Orgasm blush and to top it off, it comes with all the shades that make Orgasm blush. I love to use the darker pink for some contouring and the gold for highlights (as well as an eyeshadow base). When I go out at night or am feeling exceptionally girlish, I blend the regular Orgasm with the bright pink for an ever-so-perfect flush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am tempted to stock up on this palette since it is limited edition and I don&#x27;t believe that you can have too many perfect palettes such as this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you think you want this product - buy it. If you don&#x27;t think you want this product - buy it anyway, you will not regret it.</li>
            <li> So after reading and hearing how great the NARS Orgasm Blush is and that it looks beautiful on all skin  tones I had to try it -after all a great blush can do wonders!! Not the case with the NARS blush in fact I&#x27;ve tried other brands that I think look nicer. The colors on this palette differ so much from one another if you&#x27;re not careful you&#x27;re liable to end up looking like a clown! The &amp;#34;gold&amp;#34; highlighter looks yellow on my medium-tan skin tone and the texture of the product just feels cheap. The blush looks grainy. I know quality when I can feel and see it and I was very disappointed with this product. Oh and the worst part is the price!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!! Nars is one of my favorite brands I own many of their products and this pallet is a great addition to my collection. Their blushes are one of my fav items; I already own orgasm in a single compact but this pallet is great for traveling. It has the colors that make up orgasm and I love that there are 2 matte colors. The pigment and longevity on this product is perfect and Im glad I own it now! Shipping was fast and my product came in tact and brand new in its original packaging.</li>
