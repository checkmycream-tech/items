            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>although not too liquidy, this is a thicker lotion which works great.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t do a great job at removing mascara.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also not oily--which is great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great value.  </li>
            <li>This product had great reviews, so I tried it.</li>
            <li>GREAT EYE MAKE UP REMOVER</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t work at great as I wanted it to, but it does work.</li>
            <li>... Will happily continue to use the Neutrogena Eye MR in liquid form.</li>
            <li>Now, I&#x27;m on the search for a great makeup remover.</li>
            <li>I was so happy when I tried this</li>
            <li>This works great, has no residue, and feels moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I love it!!</li>
            <li>Most awesome eye makeup remover I have ever used!  </li>
            <li>(but they discontinued it, so this is a good replacement for it).</li>
            <li>Not as good as I expect.</li>
            <li>The price is good.  </li>
            <li>Does a good job taking off eye makeup without drying out my skin or getting into my eyes.</li>
            <li>This product is also good for people that travel with carry on bags, since is a 3oz</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and creamy, just perfect.</li>
            <li>but this is definitely a good replacement.</li>
            <li>Very good product - feels comforting to the eyes, very effective in removing make-up, but one draw-back that I notice every day - just wish it had a pleasant, fresh scent</li>
            <li>It works perfectly for non-waterproof mascara and adequately for waterproof mascara.</li>
            <li>Not my most favorite neutrogena product, but great!</li>
            <li>Very pleased.  </li>
            <li>It am very pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li>I love this product !! :-)</li>
            <li>This is the best eye makeup remover on the market, it&#x27;s also very gentle.  </li>
            <li>And...I am a huge fan of the price!!</li>
            <li>I love this eye makeup remover, however I can&#x27;t find it in stores!  </li>

            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>Nice makeup remover.</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace the liquid eye remover and did not find it to be as effective as the liquid version.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a nice consistency</li>
            <li>This cream effectively removes all kinds of eye makeup without greasiness.</li>
            <li>Honestly, it feels like makeup should be sinking into my skin, but it isn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>This is really nice.</li>
            <li>I was thrilled.  </li>
            <li>Well for me the product is not as effective as the liquid one.</li>
            <li>This is the best of the best when it comes to taking off eye makeup and is hard to find in many stores.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It feels nice going on and it does remove most of the mascara I use which is waterproof.  </li>
            <li>Best eye makeup remover for people who have sensitive skin and wear waterproof makeup</li>
            <li>This is by far the best eye makeup remover.  </li>
            <li>This product is by far the best eye makeup remover that I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>It also has a great price so worth picking up more than one.</li>
            <li>there is no other options to choose from, because it is the best.</li>
            <li>I wear contacts, so that is a very important feature to me.</li>
            <li>I got exactly what I wanted they are packaged nice, good products.</li>
            <li>Removes makeup easily, even the waterproof kind.  </li>
            <li>Best eye makeup remover ever - light, dissolves makeup effectively, very creamy so easy to use.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff as a pre-washing remover.  </li>
            <li>This gets most makeup off, even waterproof.  </li>
            <li>This is preferable to the oily kind of eye makeup remover, it won&#x27;t make you break out, and it doesn&#x27;t burn your eyes either like some of the oil free liquid formula.</li>
            <li>purchased for grand daughter - she loves this product</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>sure I&#x27;d buy again though</li>
            <li>I wish this product was more widely available!</li>
            <li>There are a lot of better products out there, skip this one.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>I love it because it doesn&#x27;t leave a film in my eyes the way so many eye makeup removers do.</li>
            <li>Love the way it removes my eye makeup without leaving oily residue or drying out my eyes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad that I could get it through Amazon.</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS.</li>
            <li>Judging by the majority of reviews, most users really love this makeup remover.</li>
            <li>Most of the them seem to have an oily residue (even the ones that are oil-free) or they sting my eyes or some</li>
            <li>However, after using this product, I felt the jojoba oil did a better job removing the eye makeup</li>
            <li>and it works better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Love this make up remover.</li>
            <li>I love how it takes off my makeup without being greasy.  </li>
            <li>Been using it a week and love it</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Eventually I did manage to remove most of my eye makeup, but it took a lot more effort than it should.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>It can remove most of the makeup though.</li>
            <li>I tried the liquid removers but the remover pads have so many chemicals that end up in my eye</li>
            <li>I really like it works great.</li>
            <li>It removes any kind of make up, be it smoky or light and nourishes your skin.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for years and cannot find it in most drugstores</li>
            <li>I love it, and hope this product never gets discontinued.</li>
            <li>is 10000times better.</li>
            <li>Smear remover all over eyes, making sure to get it onto eye lashes (please note the lack of burning)&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>i love it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, but liquid products work bettere and are easier on the skin around the eyes.</li>
            <li>this product you can control the amount you need, a dot, or more, and it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t been able to find this in any drugstore</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I really love it,.</li>
            <li>I love Neutrogena products, however, this eye makeup remover did not work for me.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t able to use them...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d irritated my eye lids with cleansers and yanked out about most of my eyelashes trying to remove eye makeup.  </li>
            <li>Love this eye makeup remover.</li>
            <li>I love this makeup remover.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Gets all the mascara off without yanking out any eyelashes. :)</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Most mascara removers incites psorias.  </li>
            <li>This is definitely my favorite remover product and I&#x27;ve tried ones from Lancome, Clinique, etc.</li>
            <li>Definitely the best out there.</li>
            <li>Very effective and yet gentle.  </li>
            <li>Gentle but very effective eye makeup remover.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Neutrogena products for a long time, and usually I am very happy with them.</li>
            <li>it works best for me if i use it to wash my face and dry it off with a cloth or towel.</li>
            <li>This a good product I must say, the creamy touch on the soft skin in an around eyes gives you a nice feeling.</li>
            <li>I have a very sensitive skin, I use it for the face as well, works great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s probably fine if you don&#x27;t get it in your eyes</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is gentle on the eyes and does a good job of removing makeup.  </li>
            <li>Good price; does not irritate eyes; good at removing mascara; goes a long ways.</li>
            <li>Not only is the lotion perfect for travel - no mess - it feels so good when taking off eye makeup.</li>
            <li>removes make up  perfectly without any allergic reactions, on the skin feels no grease, but soft with some tightening of skin, fresh and clean...</li>
            <li>This removes your mascara easily without making  your eyes blurry.  </li>
            <li>Lotion-based eye make-up removers leave my eyes feeling moisturized while easily removing all eye make-up.</li>
            <li>Does not remove waterproof eye makeup easily.</li>
            <li>I have used it for years and it used to be easy to find.</li>
            <li>It easily takes off my mascara without making my eyelids greasy.  </li>
            <li>just don&#x27;t take the make-up off easily</li>
            <li>Makeup comes off easily and this is moisturizing and leaves no oily feeling on my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for years and is easy to remove eye makeup without pulling on the eye.</li>
            <li>It goes on easily</li>
            <li>I like that it is in lotion  form and easy on  my eyes.</li>
            <li>Very gentle and effective.</li>
            <li>It is very gentle but effectively removes makeup.</li>
            <li>This is pretty effective at removing eye makeup.</li>
            <li>I cannot believe how quickly and thoroughly this removes my waterproof mascara, and not scrubbing is needed!  </li>
            <li>lightweight, fragrance-free lotion is fast and effective, not to mention easy on your budget.  </li>
            <li>Sooooo happy to have finally found a product that works for me.</li>
            <li>Lightly massage and all of my eye makeup and mascara comes when I rinse my face to add cleanser.</li>
            <li>This stuff is fantastic.</li>
            <li>This stuff doesn&#x27;t do a great job of removing eye makeup left under my eyes and burns my skin in the process.</li>
            <li>Mind you, I don&#x27;t use waterproof.&lt;br /&gt;Also, leaving on the &amp;#34;excess&amp;#34; is not such a great idea.</li>
            <li>I find it works best when applied with a tissue rather than using my fingers, and holding the tissue with the product on my lashes for a few seconds to soften the mascara before wiping it off.</li>
            <li>This is far superior to the liquid eye makeup removers.</li>
            <li>Overall, satisfied with product, good value for the money.</li>
            <li>It works great and does not cause the redness around the eye area that I have had with many other removers.  </li>
            <li>I use a regular mascara and eyeliner which are both removed very easily and effectively.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve searched high and low and this is the best eye makeup remover I&#x27;ve found to date.  </li>
            <li>Quick and easy eye makeup remover.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear waterproof eye makeup, but it easily and quickly removes everything.</li>
            <li>Gentle, mild, effective.</li>
            <li>They stopped carrying it at the store where I originally found it.  </li>
            <li>Love the way it gently takes away makeup!</li>
            <li>I was originally using this on my face and then wiping it off with a cotton pad.  </li>
            <li>Leaves your eyes feeling fine and it removes the makeup super</li>
            <li>I love so much!</li>
            <li>This remover is soooo worth it!  </li>
            <li>It does the job and it feels so cool, smooth, clean when I use it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different eye makeup removers, and this was by far the best.  </li>
            <li>I find myself having to use a makeup remover pad after using this to completely clean around my eyes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had this special ordered, as I could not find it in the stores.</li>
            <li>--it&#x27;s hard to find in stores so ordering here is best!</li>
            <li>So, obviously I was very pleased when I discovered it was available here on amazon.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin or eyes, feels cool and soothing when I use it</li>
            <li>Have to really rub, which is what I want to avoid, my eye area to get most of it off but not all.  </li>
            <li>It gets even the most stubborn makeup off fast and without residue.</li>
            <li>Good for eye shadow only.</li>
            <li>This rinses off easy, and is very gently to the eyes.</li>
            <li>Great product for me and lasts so much longer than same amount invested in liquid remover.</li>
            <li>Takes it off quickly with no rubbing or stress to the eye.</li>
            <li>n remove makeup quickly...</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for it but found it to be just ok.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It IS very gentle!</li>
            <li>I was thrilled to find it here and will continue to order it for as long as it is available.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and really works.</li>
            <li>Creamy consistency removes mascara so gentle and easy.</li>
            <li>So, with high hopes, I tried this product, and I was not disappointed!</li>
            <li>It does a great job taking off my eye make up at the end of the day with a little cotton ball.</li>
            <li>Fantastic feel, very moisturized and no oily residue.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re better off getting a generic brand at the store of something oil free based and cheaper.</li>
            <li>I had blurred vision until I was able to remove it completely with another</li>
            <li>I bought this because Neutrogena made makeup remover wipes that I really loved, the best I had every used, but no local stores carry them and they are rather expensive here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I felt it was worth a shot.</li>
            <li>Of course, I only buy Neutrogena, but this takes everything off nicely and no oily residue.  </li>
            <li>As a bonus, this lotion gives a refreshing sensation and leaves the skin velvety soft.</li>
            <li>have never had much success with them and they always feel oily.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it worth the money.</li>
            <li>This product removes all of my eye makeup, even better than my old standby, Neutrogena Oil-Free Eye Makeup Remover.</li>
            <li>Gentle but very thorough!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m amazed at how long I&#x27;ve been able to strech just one tube of this stuff!</li>
            <li>To me buying make up remover is almost as elusive as buying the right mascara.</li>
            <li>- it doesn&#x27;t even have no scent, it has a less than pleasant scent.  </li>
            <li>It is very gentle, I can use my fingers instead of a cotton pad or towelette; it gets it all of easily; and it doesn&#x27;t dry my already over-dry skin even more.  </li>
            <li>It arrived quickly, so I was pleased with the online purchase overall.</li>
            <li>I really like the cool cream feeling on my eye lids</li>
            <li>However, it isn&#x27;t unlike any other product on the market and isn&#x27;t *exceptionally* hydrating.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so nice because it lasts a long time, is fragrance-free, and it&#x27;s very gentle; you don&#x27;t have to scrub and scrape with a cotton ball, so you won&#x27;t have to lose any eyelashes trying to get your mascara out.</li>
            <li>I really like Neutrogena&#x27;s liquid eye makeup remover and thought this lotion version would be even better as it would provide some moisture to my sensitive eye area</li>
            <li>Easy on the eyes and takes mascara and eye shadow off with no trouble at all.  </li>
            <li>I love the way it leaves my lashes clean yet not oily nor dry.  </li>
            <li>This is very gentle on your eyes and does not leave an oily residue.  </li>
            <li>and it is very gentle if it does happen to get in your eye.  </li>
            <li>it removes makeup gentely, it burns a little bit if it goes into your eyes, but it is really good</li>
            <li>Its silky texture is amazing and it removes makeup very easily without irritating the skin.</li>
            <li>The only one I&#x27;ve found that was better than this was one that used to be made by oil of olay that was also a lotion type</li>
            <li>I stock up on it as I never want to be without it as it is the only one I love.  </li>
            <li>so I have ordered more than several from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I simply used my fingers cuz don&#x27;t like to use cotton pad, but I guess cotton pad/towelette would work better.</li>
            <li>First time trying a lotion remover.</li>
            <li>Very Hydrating, but it again!</li>
            <li>love this product but cannot find locally ...</li>
            <li>Definitely will order more.</li>
            <li>I followed product instructions exactly, using a tissue.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s silky smooth, as to not pull on the sensitive skin around your eyes, and it doesn&#x27;t leave your eyes feeling slimey.</li>
            <li>First, get a tissue and place it in front of you.  </li>
            <li>so I always make sure I have an extra on hand.</li>
            <li>This was my first time trying this product</li>
            <li>It really gets all my makeup off, even my waterproof eyeliner comes off!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s WAY cheaper than those expensive bi-phasic cleansers, and it feels great!</li>
            <li>It even removes my Benefit &#x27;they&#x27;re real&#x27; masacara n eye liner !</li>
            <li>The pads that are saturated don&#x27;t have enough moisture in them and the process has to be repeated many times,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Would probably be ok with regular mascara.</li>
            <li>This removes eye makeup gently and with no oily residue!</li>
            <li>Easy to use, affordable, works really well, leaves skin around my eyes feeling soft, no fragrance - what else can I say?</li>
            <li>If your skin is very sensitive, you might want to try this for full face makeup</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle, it&#x27;s just creamy and light enough to not be heavy, and still cleans well without having to apply it many many times.  </li>
            <li>This lotion is more of a cream, thick and easier to apply and remove than products that are more liquid.  </li>
            <li>I have used this for a long time and I love it.  </li>
            <li>It quickly and easily removed my waterproof mascara and left the eye area soft, without a greasy residue.</li>
            <li>Other eye makeup remover lotions I&#x27;ve used haven&#x27;t worked well, but this is amazing stuff, and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Makeup is completely removed and it keeps the skin around my eyes very soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>However, I don&#x27;t think I will be able to use it in the very dry winter months at all.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best eye makeup remover I&#x27;ve found so far and order it online because it can be hard to find locally.</li>
            <li>and it really takes all of the makeup off including the waterproof.</li>
            <li>thanks Amazon for carrying it, removes eye makeup with ease - lotion leaves no residue or oily feel</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>This Eye Makeup Remover is not doing much for me.  </li>
            <li>This one is gentle, but that&#x27;s all I can say for it.</li>
            <li>This lotion made my skin feel very oily.</li>
            <li>The pros are that it removes my eye makeup very well.</li>
            <li>it doesnt remove quite as much.</li>
            <li>so I have to be very selective with products I use on my face</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>For years I used the Clinique Naturally Gentle Eye Makeup Remover Lotion, but it has become too overpriced ($18 for just 2.5 oz).</li>
            <li>Just a pea size amount of the product gently rubbed around my eyes removes 95% of my eye make up.</li>
            <li>Then, squeeze a bit from the tube and gently massage it in the eye area.  </li>
            <li>You just put a dab on your ring fingers, gently rub over eye area and wipe off with a tissue.  </li>
            <li>Very creamy and does not cause eye irritation.  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t care for this stuff AT ALL.</li>
            <li>It gently removed all my makeup including mascara and waterproof liquid liner.  </li>
            <li>Three times should do it depending on how much eye make up you use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very think</li>
            <li>so I just started and kept using a gentle face wash for that.</li>
            <li>this really BURNS.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes and because it&#x27;s a cream, it&#x27;s a gentle way to remove eye makeup.</li>
            <li>Neutrogena Hydrating Eye Makeup Remover Lotion works very well, without irritation.</li>
            <li>Gentle removes makeup without leaving an oily residue and does not break out my face.</li>
            <li>This stuff removes absolutely everything.</li>
            <li>This one is gentle.  </li>
            <li>So, it is great EXCEPT it loses one whole star because, in being unscented, it smells like Mod Podge, an old school crafting glue / lacquer.</li>
            <li>The mascara I use leaves a good deal of residue, and with other makeup removers two or three uses were needed to get the same effect and</li>
            <li>Decent product, but for the price I didn&#x27;t find it to be any better than any other makeup removing product I have.</li>
            <li>Nice slick, creamy texture.  </li>
            <li>the new mascara may be one of those that just doesn&#x27;t want to come off!  </li>
            <li>I tried so many different options: from facial wipes to oil-based and on.  </li>
            <li>More of a mess maker than anything.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Most products I&#x27;ve seen are liquid, so that made me a little hesitant to buy this.</li>
            <li>Wish it worked a little better</li>
            <li>Waterproof eyeliner, etc does require a little more product but it does remove it.</li>
            <li>I have to use a little more than I did with the Oil of Olay</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used all of the major dept store brands&#x27; liquid versions, but something about this light weight creme seems to go the extra mile.  </li>
            <li>This works really well for my sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li>So I keep it on hand for that but will not be purchasing again to use as part of my regular routine at home.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a quality product and worth trying for yourself since results vary among users.</li>
            <li>Enter shower, use normal makeup remover cleanser all over face.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li>Even if I have on urban decay primer and waterproof mascara, it will come right off.</li>
            <li>, bur can&#x27;t say it is this remover as I started using a new mascara and</li>
            <li>Because I have very sensitive eyelids all of the oil based removers burn my lids.</li>
            <li>It wipes my eye makeup off well and it leaves my skin feeling very soft.</li>
            <li>This is a very unusual place for me to have pimples, so I quickly pinpointed it to this product as the only thing I had recently changed in my routine.&lt;br /&gt;In fairness though, I was applying this cream to my eyes, then applying my regular cleanser to the rest of my face and then rinsing it all off at once.</li>
            <li>This takes off most of my makeup with one or two swipes, but I will say that sometimes the next morning I have dark circles again from remaining mascara and have to apply again.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad that Amazon.com has this because its hard to find in the stores.</li>
            <li>It burns my eyes and doesn&#x27;t completely take off the blackish color after your mascara is off.</li>
            <li>Since then, I have lessened the amount I&#x27;m using, and I wipe it off with a kleenex before cleansing the rest of my face, and the breakouts are nearly gone.&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ll probably seek out a product that is completely non-comedogenic.</li>
            <li>But I can deal with that (or take out my contacts)--the benefits far outweigh the costs.</li>
            <li>My eyes are really sensitive, but this doesn&#x27;t bother them.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive eyes, and this doesn&#x27;t sting or irritate my eyes or skin.</li>
            <li>only remover that really works</li>
            <li>It gets my eye make-off better than any of the wet products and with minimal rubbing, which you don&#x27;t want to do around your sensitive eye skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used plenty of eye makeup removers, but this is completely different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would not recommend this product for people who have I have sensitive skin, it made me break out.  </li>
            <li>, I am having no trouble with it drying out my skin</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin around my eyes which get irritated by every product (even sensitive skin ones)</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li>And for being something that is made to use on the sensitive eye area...</li>
            <li>would recommend this to every one with sensitive eyes I also use it to remove makeup from my face.</li>
            <li>Leaves it well hydrated and soft to  touch</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin (battled acne extreme in middle school,  high school and college</li>
            <li>but that could also be the hot dry summer weather messing with me.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy to control the amount to use because of the small opening on the tube.  </li>
            <li>The eyeshadow smeared around my face and didn&#x27;t really come off very well, the mascara turned into wet clumps on my lashes and I was scared they were going to pull off, and the eyeliner barely budged.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying alternatives such as makeup remover wipes which some are ok but still very harsh on the sensitive eye area.</li>
            <li>Because it&#x27;s slick, there isn&#x27;t a lot of tugging on the skin to damage or cause premature fine lines.</li>
            <li>so I have to be super careful about what I use to remove my make-up (oddly enough</li>
            <li>This &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34; is amazing at removing little to heavy eye make-up.</li>
            <li>After at least 2 weeks my eyelids are soft and smooth again and no irritation.  </li>
            <li>I only use waterproof mascara so finding a makeup remover to take it off completely can be a challenge.  </li>
            <li>I much prefer it to any other makeup remover.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use it very often, but there was a little bit of irritation when I used it maybe because I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>For some reason the local stores have apparently stopped carrying it.</li>
            <li>Keep eyes closed super tight</li>
            <li>It does not irritate my eyes after i use it, the dryness has improved right away,and gets it off with usually one application</li>
            <li>I have very dry and delicate skin that is easily irritated.</li>
            <li>Give it a little time to work, then wipe gently with the tissue.  </li>
            <li>One other thing, very sensitive eyes, and</li>

            <li> the Neutrogena product is a great replacement.  </li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> although not too liquidy, this is a thicker lotion which works great.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do a great job at removing mascara.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also not oily--which is great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great value.  </li>
            <li> This product had great reviews, so I tried it.</li>
            <li> GREAT EYE MAKE UP REMOVER</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work at great as I wanted it to, but it does work.</li>
            <li> ... Will happily continue to use the Neutrogena Eye MR in liquid form.</li>
            <li> Now, I&#x27;m on the search for a great makeup remover.</li>
            <li> I was so happy when I tried this</li>
            <li> This works great, has no residue, and feels moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I love it!!</li>
            <li> Most awesome eye makeup remover I have ever used!  </li>
            <li> (but they discontinued it, so this is a good replacement for it).</li>
            <li> Not as good as I expect.</li>
            <li> The price is good.  </li>
            <li> Does a good job taking off eye makeup without drying out my skin or getting into my eyes.</li>
            <li> This product is also good for people that travel with carry on bags, since is a 3oz</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and creamy, just perfect.</li>
            <li> but this is definitely a good replacement.</li>
            <li> Very good product - feels comforting to the eyes, very effective in removing make-up, but one draw-back that I notice every day - just wish it had a pleasant, fresh scent</li>
            <li> It works perfectly for non-waterproof mascara and adequately for waterproof mascara.</li>
            <li> Not my most favorite neutrogena product, but great!</li>
            <li> Very pleased.  </li>
            <li> It am very pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li> I love this product !! :-)</li>
            <li> This is the best eye makeup remover on the market, it&#x27;s also very gentle.  </li>
            <li> And...I am a huge fan of the price!!</li>
            <li> I love this eye makeup remover, however I can&#x27;t find it in stores!  </li>
            <li> Love this makeup remover!  </li>
            <li> So I am so glad to have found this online!</li>
            <li> I love this !</li>
            <li> I love this stuff because it works!</li>
            <li> Love this!  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I really love this!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> Nice makeup remover.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace the liquid eye remover and did not find it to be as effective as the liquid version.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a nice consistency</li>
            <li> This cream effectively removes all kinds of eye makeup without greasiness.</li>
            <li> Honestly, it feels like makeup should be sinking into my skin, but it isn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> This is really nice.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled.  </li>
            <li> Well for me the product is not as effective as the liquid one.</li>
            <li> This is the best of the best when it comes to taking off eye makeup and is hard to find in many stores.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It feels nice going on and it does remove most of the mascara I use which is waterproof.  </li>
            <li> Best eye makeup remover for people who have sensitive skin and wear waterproof makeup</li>
            <li> This is by far the best eye makeup remover.  </li>
            <li> This product is by far the best eye makeup remover that I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> It also has a great price so worth picking up more than one.</li>
            <li> there is no other options to choose from, because it is the best.</li>
            <li> I wear contacts, so that is a very important feature to me.</li>
            <li> I got exactly what I wanted they are packaged nice, good products.</li>
            <li> Removes makeup easily, even the waterproof kind.  </li>
            <li> Best eye makeup remover ever - light, dissolves makeup effectively, very creamy so easy to use.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff as a pre-washing remover.  </li>
            <li> This gets most makeup off, even waterproof.  </li>
            <li> This is preferable to the oily kind of eye makeup remover, it won&#x27;t make you break out, and it doesn&#x27;t burn your eyes either like some of the oil free liquid formula.</li>
            <li> purchased for grand daughter - she loves this product</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> sure I&#x27;d buy again though</li>
            <li> I wish this product was more widely available!</li>
            <li> There are a lot of better products out there, skip this one.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li> I love it because it doesn&#x27;t leave a film in my eyes the way so many eye makeup removers do.</li>
            <li> Love the way it removes my eye makeup without leaving oily residue or drying out my eyes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad that I could get it through Amazon.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS.</li>
            <li> Judging by the majority of reviews, most users really love this makeup remover.</li>
            <li> Most of the them seem to have an oily residue (even the ones that are oil-free) or they sting my eyes or some</li>
            <li> However, after using this product, I felt the jojoba oil did a better job removing the eye makeup</li>
            <li> and it works better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Love this make up remover.</li>
            <li> I love how it takes off my makeup without being greasy.  </li>
            <li> Been using it a week and love it</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Eventually I did manage to remove most of my eye makeup, but it took a lot more effort than it should.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> It can remove most of the makeup though.</li>
            <li> I tried the liquid removers but the remover pads have so many chemicals that end up in my eye</li>
            <li> I really like it works great.</li>
            <li> It removes any kind of make up, be it smoky or light and nourishes your skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for years and cannot find it in most drugstores</li>
            <li> I love it, and hope this product never gets discontinued.</li>
            <li> is 10000times better.</li>
            <li> Smear remover all over eyes, making sure to get it onto eye lashes (please note the lack of burning)&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> i love it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, but liquid products work bettere and are easier on the skin around the eyes.</li>
            <li> this product you can control the amount you need, a dot, or more, and it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t been able to find this in any drugstore</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I really love it,.</li>
            <li> I love Neutrogena products, however, this eye makeup remover did not work for me.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t able to use them...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d irritated my eye lids with cleansers and yanked out about most of my eyelashes trying to remove eye makeup.  </li>
            <li> Love this eye makeup remover.</li>
            <li> I love this makeup remover.  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Gets all the mascara off without yanking out any eyelashes. :)</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Most mascara removers incites psorias.  </li>
            <li> This is definitely my favorite remover product and I&#x27;ve tried ones from Lancome, Clinique, etc.</li>
            <li> Definitely the best out there.</li>
            <li> Very effective and yet gentle.  </li>
            <li> Gentle but very effective eye makeup remover.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Neutrogena products for a long time, and usually I am very happy with them.</li>
            <li> it works best for me if i use it to wash my face and dry it off with a cloth or towel.</li>
            <li> This a good product I must say, the creamy touch on the soft skin in an around eyes gives you a nice feeling.</li>
            <li> I have a very sensitive skin, I use it for the face as well, works great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s probably fine if you don&#x27;t get it in your eyes</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is gentle on the eyes and does a good job of removing makeup.  </li>
            <li> Good price; does not irritate eyes; good at removing mascara; goes a long ways.</li>
            <li> Not only is the lotion perfect for travel - no mess - it feels so good when taking off eye makeup.</li>
            <li> removes make up  perfectly without any allergic reactions, on the skin feels no grease, but soft with some tightening of skin, fresh and clean...</li>
            <li> This removes your mascara easily without making  your eyes blurry.  </li>
            <li> Lotion-based eye make-up removers leave my eyes feeling moisturized while easily removing all eye make-up.</li>
            <li> Does not remove waterproof eye makeup easily.</li>
            <li> I have used it for years and it used to be easy to find.</li>
            <li> It easily takes off my mascara without making my eyelids greasy.  </li>
            <li> just don&#x27;t take the make-up off easily</li>
            <li> Makeup comes off easily and this is moisturizing and leaves no oily feeling on my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years and is easy to remove eye makeup without pulling on the eye.</li>
            <li> It goes on easily</li>
            <li> I like that it is in lotion  form and easy on  my eyes.</li>
            <li> Very gentle and effective.</li>
            <li> It is very gentle but effectively removes makeup.</li>
            <li> This is pretty effective at removing eye makeup.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe how quickly and thoroughly this removes my waterproof mascara, and not scrubbing is needed!  </li>
            <li> lightweight, fragrance-free lotion is fast and effective, not to mention easy on your budget.  </li>
            <li> Sooooo happy to have finally found a product that works for me.</li>
            <li> Lightly massage and all of my eye makeup and mascara comes when I rinse my face to add cleanser.</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic.</li>
            <li> This stuff doesn&#x27;t do a great job of removing eye makeup left under my eyes and burns my skin in the process.</li>
            <li> Mind you, I don&#x27;t use waterproof.&lt;br /&gt;Also, leaving on the &amp;#34;excess&amp;#34; is not such a great idea.</li>
            <li> I find it works best when applied with a tissue rather than using my fingers, and holding the tissue with the product on my lashes for a few seconds to soften the mascara before wiping it off.</li>
            <li> This is far superior to the liquid eye makeup removers.</li>
            <li> Overall, satisfied with product, good value for the money.</li>
            <li> It works great and does not cause the redness around the eye area that I have had with many other removers.  </li>
            <li> I use a regular mascara and eyeliner which are both removed very easily and effectively.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve searched high and low and this is the best eye makeup remover I&#x27;ve found to date.  </li>
            <li> Quick and easy eye makeup remover.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear waterproof eye makeup, but it easily and quickly removes everything.</li>
            <li> Gentle, mild, effective.</li>
            <li> They stopped carrying it at the store where I originally found it.  </li>
            <li> Love the way it gently takes away makeup!</li>
            <li> I was originally using this on my face and then wiping it off with a cotton pad.  </li>
            <li> Leaves your eyes feeling fine and it removes the makeup super</li>
            <li> I love so much!</li>
            <li> This remover is soooo worth it!  </li>
            <li> It does the job and it feels so cool, smooth, clean when I use it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different eye makeup removers, and this was by far the best.  </li>
            <li> I find myself having to use a makeup remover pad after using this to completely clean around my eyes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had this special ordered, as I could not find it in the stores.</li>
            <li> --it&#x27;s hard to find in stores so ordering here is best!</li>
            <li> So, obviously I was very pleased when I discovered it was available here on amazon.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin or eyes, feels cool and soothing when I use it</li>
            <li> Have to really rub, which is what I want to avoid, my eye area to get most of it off but not all.  </li>
            <li> It gets even the most stubborn makeup off fast and without residue.</li>
            <li> Good for eye shadow only.</li>
            <li> This rinses off easy, and is very gently to the eyes.</li>
            <li> Great product for me and lasts so much longer than same amount invested in liquid remover.</li>
            <li> Takes it off quickly with no rubbing or stress to the eye.</li>
            <li> n remove makeup quickly...</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for it but found it to be just ok.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It IS very gentle!</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to find it here and will continue to order it for as long as it is available.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and really works.</li>
            <li> Creamy consistency removes mascara so gentle and easy.</li>
            <li> So, with high hopes, I tried this product, and I was not disappointed!</li>
            <li> It does a great job taking off my eye make up at the end of the day with a little cotton ball.</li>
            <li> Fantastic feel, very moisturized and no oily residue.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re better off getting a generic brand at the store of something oil free based and cheaper.</li>
            <li> I had blurred vision until I was able to remove it completely with another</li>
            <li> I bought this because Neutrogena made makeup remover wipes that I really loved, the best I had every used, but no local stores carry them and they are rather expensive here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I felt it was worth a shot.</li>
            <li> Of course, I only buy Neutrogena, but this takes everything off nicely and no oily residue.  </li>
            <li> As a bonus, this lotion gives a refreshing sensation and leaves the skin velvety soft.</li>
            <li> have never had much success with them and they always feel oily.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it worth the money.</li>
            <li> This product removes all of my eye makeup, even better than my old standby, Neutrogena Oil-Free Eye Makeup Remover.</li>
            <li> Gentle but very thorough!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m amazed at how long I&#x27;ve been able to strech just one tube of this stuff!</li>
            <li> To me buying make up remover is almost as elusive as buying the right mascara.</li>
            <li> - it doesn&#x27;t even have no scent, it has a less than pleasant scent.  </li>
            <li> It is very gentle, I can use my fingers instead of a cotton pad or towelette; it gets it all of easily; and it doesn&#x27;t dry my already over-dry skin even more.  </li>
            <li> It arrived quickly, so I was pleased with the online purchase overall.</li>
            <li> I really like the cool cream feeling on my eye lids</li>
            <li> However, it isn&#x27;t unlike any other product on the market and isn&#x27;t *exceptionally* hydrating.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so nice because it lasts a long time, is fragrance-free, and it&#x27;s very gentle; you don&#x27;t have to scrub and scrape with a cotton ball, so you won&#x27;t have to lose any eyelashes trying to get your mascara out.</li>
            <li> I really like Neutrogena&#x27;s liquid eye makeup remover and thought this lotion version would be even better as it would provide some moisture to my sensitive eye area</li>
            <li> Easy on the eyes and takes mascara and eye shadow off with no trouble at all.  </li>
            <li> I love the way it leaves my lashes clean yet not oily nor dry.  </li>
            <li> This is very gentle on your eyes and does not leave an oily residue.  </li>
            <li> and it is very gentle if it does happen to get in your eye.  </li>
            <li> it removes makeup gentely, it burns a little bit if it goes into your eyes, but it is really good</li>
            <li> Its silky texture is amazing and it removes makeup very easily without irritating the skin.</li>
            <li> The only one I&#x27;ve found that was better than this was one that used to be made by oil of olay that was also a lotion type</li>
            <li> I stock up on it as I never want to be without it as it is the only one I love.  </li>
            <li> so I have ordered more than several from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I simply used my fingers cuz don&#x27;t like to use cotton pad, but I guess cotton pad/towelette would work better.</li>
            <li> First time trying a lotion remover.</li>
            <li> Very Hydrating, but it again!</li>
            <li> love this product but cannot find locally ...</li>
            <li> Definitely will order more.</li>
            <li> I followed product instructions exactly, using a tissue.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s silky smooth, as to not pull on the sensitive skin around your eyes, and it doesn&#x27;t leave your eyes feeling slimey.</li>
            <li> First, get a tissue and place it in front of you.  </li>
            <li> so I always make sure I have an extra on hand.</li>
            <li> This was my first time trying this product</li>
            <li> It really gets all my makeup off, even my waterproof eyeliner comes off!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s WAY cheaper than those expensive bi-phasic cleansers, and it feels great!</li>
            <li> It even removes my Benefit &#x27;they&#x27;re real&#x27; masacara n eye liner !</li>
            <li> The pads that are saturated don&#x27;t have enough moisture in them and the process has to be repeated many times,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Would probably be ok with regular mascara.</li>
            <li> This removes eye makeup gently and with no oily residue!</li>
            <li> Easy to use, affordable, works really well, leaves skin around my eyes feeling soft, no fragrance - what else can I say?</li>
            <li> If your skin is very sensitive, you might want to try this for full face makeup</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle, it&#x27;s just creamy and light enough to not be heavy, and still cleans well without having to apply it many many times.  </li>
            <li> This lotion is more of a cream, thick and easier to apply and remove than products that are more liquid.  </li>
            <li> I have used this for a long time and I love it.  </li>
            <li> It quickly and easily removed my waterproof mascara and left the eye area soft, without a greasy residue.</li>
            <li> Other eye makeup remover lotions I&#x27;ve used haven&#x27;t worked well, but this is amazing stuff, and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Makeup is completely removed and it keeps the skin around my eyes very soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> However, I don&#x27;t think I will be able to use it in the very dry winter months at all.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best eye makeup remover I&#x27;ve found so far and order it online because it can be hard to find locally.</li>
            <li> and it really takes all of the makeup off including the waterproof.</li>
            <li> thanks Amazon for carrying it, removes eye makeup with ease - lotion leaves no residue or oily feel</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This Eye Makeup Remover is not doing much for me.  </li>
            <li> This one is gentle, but that&#x27;s all I can say for it.</li>
            <li> This lotion made my skin feel very oily.</li>
            <li> The pros are that it removes my eye makeup very well.</li>
            <li> it doesnt remove quite as much.</li>
            <li> so I have to be very selective with products I use on my face</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> For years I used the Clinique Naturally Gentle Eye Makeup Remover Lotion, but it has become too overpriced ($18 for just 2.5 oz).</li>
            <li> Just a pea size amount of the product gently rubbed around my eyes removes 95% of my eye make up.</li>
            <li> Then, squeeze a bit from the tube and gently massage it in the eye area.  </li>
            <li> You just put a dab on your ring fingers, gently rub over eye area and wipe off with a tissue.  </li>
            <li> Very creamy and does not cause eye irritation.  </li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t care for this stuff AT ALL.</li>
            <li> It gently removed all my makeup including mascara and waterproof liquid liner.  </li>
            <li> Three times should do it depending on how much eye make up you use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very think</li>
            <li> so I just started and kept using a gentle face wash for that.</li>
            <li> this really BURNS.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes and because it&#x27;s a cream, it&#x27;s a gentle way to remove eye makeup.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena Hydrating Eye Makeup Remover Lotion works very well, without irritation.</li>
            <li> Gentle removes makeup without leaving an oily residue and does not break out my face.</li>
            <li> This stuff removes absolutely everything.</li>
            <li> This one is gentle.  </li>
            <li> So, it is great EXCEPT it loses one whole star because, in being unscented, it smells like Mod Podge, an old school crafting glue / lacquer.</li>
            <li> The mascara I use leaves a good deal of residue, and with other makeup removers two or three uses were needed to get the same effect and</li>
            <li> Decent product, but for the price I didn&#x27;t find it to be any better than any other makeup removing product I have.</li>
            <li> Nice slick, creamy texture.  </li>
            <li> the new mascara may be one of those that just doesn&#x27;t want to come off!  </li>
            <li> I tried so many different options: from facial wipes to oil-based and on.  </li>
            <li> More of a mess maker than anything.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Most products I&#x27;ve seen are liquid, so that made me a little hesitant to buy this.</li>
            <li> Wish it worked a little better</li>
            <li> Waterproof eyeliner, etc does require a little more product but it does remove it.</li>
            <li> I have to use a little more than I did with the Oil of Olay</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used all of the major dept store brands&#x27; liquid versions, but something about this light weight creme seems to go the extra mile.  </li>
            <li> This works really well for my sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li> So I keep it on hand for that but will not be purchasing again to use as part of my regular routine at home.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a quality product and worth trying for yourself since results vary among users.</li>
            <li> Enter shower, use normal makeup remover cleanser all over face.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> Even if I have on urban decay primer and waterproof mascara, it will come right off.</li>
            <li> , bur can&#x27;t say it is this remover as I started using a new mascara and</li>
            <li> Because I have very sensitive eyelids all of the oil based removers burn my lids.</li>
            <li> It wipes my eye makeup off well and it leaves my skin feeling very soft.</li>
            <li> This is a very unusual place for me to have pimples, so I quickly pinpointed it to this product as the only thing I had recently changed in my routine.&lt;br /&gt;In fairness though, I was applying this cream to my eyes, then applying my regular cleanser to the rest of my face and then rinsing it all off at once.</li>
            <li> This takes off most of my makeup with one or two swipes, but I will say that sometimes the next morning I have dark circles again from remaining mascara and have to apply again.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad that Amazon.com has this because its hard to find in the stores.</li>
            <li> It burns my eyes and doesn&#x27;t completely take off the blackish color after your mascara is off.</li>
            <li> Since then, I have lessened the amount I&#x27;m using, and I wipe it off with a kleenex before cleansing the rest of my face, and the breakouts are nearly gone.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ll probably seek out a product that is completely non-comedogenic.</li>
            <li> But I can deal with that (or take out my contacts)--the benefits far outweigh the costs.</li>
            <li> My eyes are really sensitive, but this doesn&#x27;t bother them.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive eyes, and this doesn&#x27;t sting or irritate my eyes or skin.</li>
            <li> only remover that really works</li>
            <li> It gets my eye make-off better than any of the wet products and with minimal rubbing, which you don&#x27;t want to do around your sensitive eye skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used plenty of eye makeup removers, but this is completely different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product for people who have I have sensitive skin, it made me break out.  </li>
            <li> , I am having no trouble with it drying out my skin</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin around my eyes which get irritated by every product (even sensitive skin ones)</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li> And for being something that is made to use on the sensitive eye area...</li>
            <li> would recommend this to every one with sensitive eyes I also use it to remove makeup from my face.</li>
            <li> Leaves it well hydrated and soft to  touch</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin (battled acne extreme in middle school,  high school and college</li>
            <li> but that could also be the hot dry summer weather messing with me.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy to control the amount to use because of the small opening on the tube.  </li>
            <li> The eyeshadow smeared around my face and didn&#x27;t really come off very well, the mascara turned into wet clumps on my lashes and I was scared they were going to pull off, and the eyeliner barely budged.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying alternatives such as makeup remover wipes which some are ok but still very harsh on the sensitive eye area.</li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s slick, there isn&#x27;t a lot of tugging on the skin to damage or cause premature fine lines.</li>
            <li> so I have to be super careful about what I use to remove my make-up (oddly enough</li>
            <li> This &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34; is amazing at removing little to heavy eye make-up.</li>
            <li> After at least 2 weeks my eyelids are soft and smooth again and no irritation.  </li>
            <li> I only use waterproof mascara so finding a makeup remover to take it off completely can be a challenge.  </li>
            <li> I much prefer it to any other makeup remover.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use it very often, but there was a little bit of irritation when I used it maybe because I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> For some reason the local stores have apparently stopped carrying it.</li>
            <li> Keep eyes closed super tight</li>
            <li> It does not irritate my eyes after i use it, the dryness has improved right away,and gets it off with usually one application</li>
            <li> I have very dry and delicate skin that is easily irritated.</li>
            <li> Give it a little time to work, then wipe gently with the tissue.  </li>
            <li> One other thing, very sensitive eyes, and</li>
            <li> My local grocery store discontinued this remover so remaining bottles were marked down.  </li>
            <li> but all made my eyelids red and puffy within a couple of days&#x27; use to the point that my skin was starting to dry and flake off</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin (redhead) and it is non-irritating, does not leave greasy residue behind and makes mascara come off so gently.</li>
            <li> Regular liquid removers make my eyelids so dry.  </li>
            <li> It definitely moisturizes well and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin dry at all.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this, but I hate it.</li>
            <li> I received only one single bottle, instead of two as shown in picture.</li>
            <li> but I have a feeling it won&#x27;t be available much longer :(</li>
            <li> It removes every trace of eye makeup and is gentle on the delicate skin around the eye.</li>
            <li> This tube lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I do not use waterproof eye products - i.e. mascara, eyeliner or eye shadow - yet this does not completely remove my eye make up.</li>
            <li> The bottle lasts a long time as well.</li>
            <li> how long I wipe at my eyes and I have to immediately wash the eye area because my lashes feel sticky and my eyes sting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had a makeup remover lotion long ago and it was discontinued.  </li>
            <li> Also, the price is beyond belief especially when compared to the other quality brand products in department stores or even on line.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t burn or dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> Does not dry out my eyes as the previous one I was using.</li>
            <li> Most of the liquids feel like I am applying alcohol to my eyes and it&#x27;s extremely unpleasant.  </li>
            <li> I kept trying and couldn&#x27;t find it on the shelves and had to try a few others and found them to be very harsh and very alcholicic.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had problems with dry skin around my eyes when I use any other makeup remover.</li>
            <li> I have tried at least ten different eye make up removers trying to find a replacement since then</li>
            <li> I never really thought about using a lotion to remove my make up before.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave an oily veil behind and really gets every bit of makeup off.</li>
            <li> Now that I apply it to a wet face and wash off with water, followed by my face cleanser</li>
            <li> I like this product because I do not have to get my face wet and can just massage the lotion over my face.  </li>
            <li> I rub onto dry eyes and lashes to soften it all up, rinse, then proceed with my usual facial cleanser.  </li>
            <li> That is no longer an option due to being allergic to things or my eyes being irritated and very dry from that.</li>
            <li> It did a great job at making a smeared, nasty, panda eye mess though.</li>
            <li> Other lotion products have also irritated my eyelids.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Other eye makeup removers have removed my products well.  </li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> So, not saying the other people don&#x27;t have problem, I just don&#x27;t myself.</li>
            <li> No difference between this and every other grocery/drug store level product.</li>
            <li> if there is a little left after washing face, I just use a little on a q-tip and run under the eyes.  </li>
            <li> With the other eye makeup remover I used, there would some be left-over mascara or eyeliner.</li>
            <li> The skin is still a little dry in the mornings so it&#x27;s not quite as hydrating for me as it claims</li>
            <li> I noticed my under eyes getting a little dry from using soap sometimes to remove my makeup...</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Either that or my dark circles are too dark...</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t a strong or terrible smell, but just had this unpleasant trying-to-be-fresh-but-not-succeeding kind of smell.</li>
            <li> I imagine the water was causing it to run down my cheeks and clog my pores.</li>
            <li> I do get some leftover black goop in the corners after a bit</li>
            <li> My mascara is heavy duty and takes a few tries, but this product comes through.</li>
            <li> I use a slightly damp cotton round&lt;br /&gt;(Swisspers cotton rounds) and a pea sized drop of the product, which cleans both eyes.</li>
            <li> Not cool.  </li>
            <li> I have used a liquid eye makeup remover for years but in planning for a vacation I decided to take this on the trip as the liquid always seems to leak out of the container with air travel and makes a mess.</li>
            <li> I find little leftover mascara on my lower lids in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It got in my eye and stung a little</li>
            <li> I want to get thins one for my eye makeup remover, and it doesn&#x27;t hurt eye, but a little bit unsatisified is that it doesn&#x27;t remove all my eye makeup, sometimes I have to use another product to get over it</li>
            <li> I squirt a little bit (maybe a pea-sized amount) on my fingertip, then I apply it in a circular motion all over my lid.</li>
            <li> I may have cried a little.  </li>
            <li> I can have burn marks if I use too harsh of a remover.</li>
            <li> I use a cotton round and just a bit of the cream and it works wonders.</li>
            <li> and it was just messy.</li>
            <li> Wash or rinse off and no greasy residue left behind.</li>
            <li> It burns my eyes after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday to take off my eye makeup.</li>
            <li> round--</li>
            <li> My order arrived just a few days after I ordered it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m wondering if the people who are having trouble are using it correctly.</li>
            <li> I let it sit for a few seconds (10-15), then wipe it off.</li>
            <li> Plus, I think a rip out a few eyelashes getting my mascara off with those products as well.</li>
            <li> I have been struggling for the past 3-4 months to find an eye make-up remover that doesn&#x27;t irritate my eye lids after my previous fave stopped being made.  </li>
            <li> It is not easy to find an eye makeup remover that removes mascara but does not leave your eyes oily or itchy.  </li>
            <li> It is a little oiliy if u get in your eye!</li>
            <li> which was way to messy and hard to remove .</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t really take off waterproof eye makeup and it burns my eyes so bad.</li>
            <li> After getting o frustrated with trying to find a gentle eye makeup remover, i think I have found it with this product.  </li>
            <li> I usually apply it twice for waterproof mascara -</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting used to the cream texture, I usually use liquid remover.  </li>
            <li> I use ordinary, non-waterproof mascara.  </li>
            <li> Over the years I have tried several different types and brands of eye makeup remover products and was always disappointed</li>
            <li> A small amount does the trick.  </li>
            <li> (just a few drops on a cotton ball does the trick), not sticky or thick.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little hard to get waterproof mascara off of thick lashes, so I use a toothbrush and this.  </li>
            <li> I was looking to an alternative to the liquid remover, which is very messy.  </li>
            <li> A few short days after beginning to use this product, I had a major nasty breakout on both sides of my face, around my cheek bones.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it has been hard to find and sold out at Walmart</li>
            <li> does not remove make up unless you rub really hard.</li>
            <li> and I end up rubbing so hard</li>
            <li> no matter how hard I shut my eyes when trying to remove my eye makeup</li>
            <li> , I had a hard time applying it with a cotton ball or a qtip</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to use baby oil because it&#x27;s too oily and hard to wash off the residue.</li>
            <li> Soothes the delicate skin around my eyes as it cleans away all traces of eye makeup.</li>
            <li> Is not too late .after</li>
            <li> I hope that doesn&#x27;t mean it will be discontinued.  </li>
            <li> I mean</li>
            <li> Works at getting my mascara off when other makeup removers fail.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and can&#x27;t tell you how disappointed I was</li>
            <li> I used to use Clinique remover but that cost $17/bottle, this is much less expensive</li>
            <li> short, I was a bit disappointed by the purchase.</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed when I could  no longer find this product in local retail stores.</li>
            <li> behind- a definant</li>
            <li> , I can feel it absorbing into my skin, which was rather shocking, but makeup just wipes away.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried it on my whole face, and it does work, but you have to use an awful lot.  </li>
            <li> Its non irritating and moisturizing, does not sting.</li>
            <li> This product is very thick and difficult to remove.  </li>
            <li> Not sure why it got bad reviews here.  </li>
            <li> So not impressed with this eye makeup remover.  </li>
            <li> but this product is just too difficult to use.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this was not the one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I find that something of the lotion still remains no matter</li>
            <li> Also i feel like allot of these reviews are fake.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not impressed.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this after burning my eyes with another product (expensive!)</li>
            <li> I was so sad when I couldn&#x27;t find it on the shelves of ANY stores - not at the grocery store, WalMart, or Target!</li>
            <li> But not as bad as baby oil...</li>
            <li> I hate this product.</li>
            <li> I used to use an &#x27;oil&#x27; base eye-make up remover, and it always lingered in the lashes and then my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I always hate the oily eye-makeup removers that I try.</li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s not even the worst part about this.</li>
            <li> The worst part is that it burned my eyes something awful.</li>
            <li> I hate the oily liquid eye makeup removers, this stuff leaves your eyes alone!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I placed some remover on cotton balls to rub off all the makeup and then the chemicals irritated my eyes, even after I rinsed with water several times.</li>
            <li> Decent product, but for the price I didn&#x27;t find it to be any better than any other makeup removing product I have. Probably would not repurchase.</li>
            <li> Very gentle and effective.</li>
            <li> I love this eye makeup remover, however I can&#x27;t find it in stores!  I will be ordering it from Amazon going forward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is gentle on the eyes and does a good job of removing makeup.  I just put it on my fingers and massage my lashes for a minute and rinse when I get in the shower.  It also leaves no residue.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years!</li>
            <li> This is the best eye makeup remover out there., believe me!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff as a pre-washing remover.  I rub onto dry eyes and lashes to soften it all up, rinse, then proceed with my usual facial cleanser.  This gets most makeup off, even waterproof.  I have repurchased several times.</li>
            <li> This tube lasts a long time. It does a great job taking off my eye make up at the end of the day with a little cotton ball.</li>
            <li> This is preferable to the oily kind of eye makeup remover, it won&#x27;t make you break out, and it doesn&#x27;t burn your eyes either like some of the oil free liquid formula. The only one I&#x27;ve found that was better than this was one that used to be made by oil of olay that was also a lotion type (but they discontinued it, so this is a good replacement for it).</li>
            <li> purchased for grand daughter - she loves this product</li>
            <li> I cannot believe how quickly and thoroughly this removes my waterproof mascara, and not scrubbing is needed!  This is far superior to the liquid eye makeup removers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed in recent years that when I use a cotton ball or tissue to rub off my eye makeup the skin gets irritated and it hurts.  I stumbled into this product 6 months ago and I use it every.single.day.  I absolutely love it.  They stopped carrying it at the store where I originally found it.  I hope that doesn&#x27;t mean it will be discontinued.  I&#x27;m stocking up just in case!</li>
            <li> Removes all eye makeup and seems to hydrate skin as well.  Really happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Most awesome eye makeup remover I have ever used!  I stock up on it as I never want to be without it as it is the only one I love.  Sometimes it has been hard to find and sold out at Walmart so I have ordered more than several from Amazon.  This removes your mascara easily without making  your eyes blurry.  It moisturizes without being greasy!</li>
            <li> This eye makeup remover is awesome! It works perfectly for non-waterproof mascara and adequately for waterproof mascara. I usually apply it twice for waterproof mascara - I simply used my fingers cuz don&#x27;t like to use cotton pad, but I guess cotton pad/towelette would work better.</li>
            <li> First time trying a lotion remover. I hate this product. It burns my eyes and doesn&#x27;t completely take off the blackish color after your mascara is off. Have to try several times. Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> A few short days after beginning to use this product, I had a major nasty breakout on both sides of my face, around my cheek bones. This is a very unusual place for me to have pimples, so I quickly pinpointed it to this product as the only thing I had recently changed in my routine.&lt;br /&gt;In fairness though, I was applying this cream to my eyes, then applying my regular cleanser to the rest of my face and then rinsing it all off at once. I imagine the water was causing it to run down my cheeks and clog my pores. Since then, I have lessened the amount I&#x27;m using, and I wipe it off with a kleenex before cleansing the rest of my face, and the breakouts are nearly gone.&lt;br /&gt;Not sure I&#x27;d buy again though, I&#x27;ll probably seek out a product that is completely non-comedogenic.</li>
            <li> one of the best that I have found</li>
            <li> I ordered this after burning my eyes with another product (expensive!) that contains alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels nice going on and it does remove most of the mascara I use which is waterproof.  One problem is that it doesn&#x27;t quite remove it all.  I find little leftover mascara on my lower lids in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It IS very gentle!</li>
            <li> I had this special ordered, as I could not find it in the stores. Lotion-based eye make-up removers leave my eyes feeling moisturized while easily removing all eye make-up. I wish this product was more widely available! 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Actually takes makeup off without drying skin. I&#x27;ve had problems with dry skin around my eyes when I use any other makeup remover.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different eye makeup removers, and this was by far the best.  It is very gentle, I can use my fingers instead of a cotton pad or towelette; it gets it all of easily; and it doesn&#x27;t dry my already over-dry skin even more.  The only downside is that if I use it with my contacts in, I sometimes have a whitish haze for awhile.  But I can deal with that (or take out my contacts)--the benefits far outweigh the costs.</li>
            <li> This is the best eye makeup remover around!!  Gentle but very thorough!!!</li>
            <li> Nice makeup remover. However, has a bit of a struggle removing all of the mineral eye makeup and mascara.</li>
            <li> Very Hydrating, but it again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting used to the cream texture, I usually use liquid remover.  Overall it is not as greasy</li>
            <li> Very pleased.  I have been struggling for the past 3-4 months to find an eye make-up remover that doesn&#x27;t irritate my eye lids after my previous fave stopped being made.  I tried so many different options: from facial wipes to oil-based and on.  I tried products that claim to be hypo-allergenic, soothing etc. but all made my eyelids red and puffy within a couple of days&#x27; use to the point that my skin was starting to dry and flake off and I was losing eyelashes.  Not cool.  Based on some of the reviews here I thought I&#x27;d give this a try.  FINALLY!  After at least 2 weeks my eyelids are soft and smooth again and no irritation.  The skin is still a little dry in the mornings so it&#x27;s not quite as hydrating for me as it claims but that could also be the hot dry summer weather messing with me.  I&#x27;ve been using it with cotton rounds for application and removal and this seems to be the best solution for me.  Sooooo happy to have finally found a product that works for me.</li>
            <li> Does not remove waterproof eye makeup easily. Had to apply several times in a row to remove eye makeup. There are a lot of better products out there, skip this one.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product. I have used it for years and it used to be easy to find. For some reason the local stores have apparently stopped carrying it. I was thrilled to find it here and will continue to order it for as long as it is available. I love it because it doesn&#x27;t leave a film in my eyes the way so many eye makeup removers do. I wear contacts, so that is a very important feature to me. It removes every trace of eye makeup and is gentle on the delicate skin around the eye.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. I have very sensitive skin (redhead) and it is non-irritating, does not leave greasy residue behind and makes mascara come off so gently.</li>
            <li> This is the only eye makeup remover that does not irritate my eyes and it really takes all of the makeup off including the waterproof.</li>
            <li> love this product but cannot find locally ... thanks Amazon for carrying it, removes eye makeup with ease - lotion leaves no residue or oily feel</li>
            <li> Love the way it removes my eye makeup without leaving oily residue or drying out my eyes.</li>
            <li> I only use waterproof mascara so finding a makeup remover to take it off completely can be a challenge.  My local grocery store discontinued this remover so remaining bottles were marked down.  I took a chance and tried it.  I love it!! It easily takes off my mascara without making my eyelids greasy.  I do get some leftover black goop in the corners after a bit but this stuff is great.  I used to use Clinique remover but that cost $17/bottle, this is much less expensive and I like how it works.</li>
            <li> Hydrating rather than oily, compared even to &amp;#34;oil-free&amp;#34; eye makeup removers.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get the makeup off. More of a mess maker than anything. You&#x27;re better off getting a generic brand at the store of something oil free based and cheaper.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 10 years. I used to buy it in the stores but couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere. I&#x27;m so glad that I could get it through Amazon. Because I have very sensitive eyelids all of the oil based removers burn my lids. Other lotion products have also irritated my eyelids. I wear contacts and waterproof mascara and it does the job.</li>
            <li> Not as good as I expect.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way! My eyes are really sensitive, but this doesn&#x27;t bother them. My mascara is heavy duty and takes a few tries, but this product comes through. Would totally order again but I won&#x27;t need to for a while; it only takes a smidgen.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace the liquid eye remover and did not find it to be as effective as the liquid version. Must be a different formulation or not as concentrated.</li>
            <li> does not remove make up unless you rub really hard. prefer the neutrogena liquid remover.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS. I used to just use my regular lotion to get rid of make up, but it would burn. This one does the trick. Definitely will order more.</li>
            <li> Doing good job for the price! Not oily neither.</li>
            <li> Judging by the majority of reviews, most users really love this makeup remover. I had high hopes for it but found it to be just ok. I do not use waterproof eye products - i.e. mascara, eyeliner or eye shadow - yet this does not completely remove my eye make up. I find myself having to use a makeup remover pad after using this to completely clean around my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;It is a nice consistency and I like the 3 oz. size tube - perfect for travel in a carry on suitcase. So I keep it on hand for that but will not be purchasing again to use as part of my regular routine at home.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a quality product and worth trying for yourself since results vary among users.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many eye make-up removers, including the expensive ones from Lancome and Estee Lauder. However, none of them compare to this one. Most of the them seem to have an oily residue (even the ones that are oil-free) or they sting my eyes or some just don&#x27;t take the make-up off easily and I end up rubbing so hard I lose eyelashes. This stuff is perfect. It has no residue, doesn&#x27;t sting, and takes the make up off with ease. Even if I have on urban decay primer and waterproof mascara, it will come right off. The bottle lasts a long time as well. I think I only buy it about once every 5-6 months. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Not my most favorite neutrogena product, but great!</li>
            <li> This product is very thick and difficult to remove.  I followed product instructions exactly, using a tissue.  It stayed in my eye lashes and got into my eyes.  I had blurred vision until I was able to remove it completely with another cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;I would never buy this again and would caution others.  It is inexpensive, so you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> This Eye Makeup Remover is not doing much for me.  It leaves mascara and eye liner around my eyes. I use ordinary, non-waterproof mascara.  Other eye makeup removers have removed my products well.  This one is gentle, but that&#x27;s all I can say for it.</li>
            <li> Best stuff for eyes.  I have used this for years.</li>
            <li> This lotion made my skin feel very oily. My pores couldn&#x27;t breathe.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and really works. I will definitely repurchase.</li>
            <li> This dissolves my waterproof mascara in seconds and leaves my lashes feeling conditioned. Soothes the delicate skin around my eyes as it cleans away all traces of eye makeup. I have sensitive eyes, and this doesn&#x27;t sting or irritate my eyes or skin.</li>
            <li> Very good product - feels comforting to the eyes, very effective in removing make-up, but one draw-back that I notice every day - just wish it had a pleasant, fresh scent - it doesn&#x27;t even have no scent, it has a less than pleasant scent.  Other than that, it performs well.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best eye make-up removers I have every used.  It&#x27;s silky smooth, as to not pull on the sensitive skin around your eyes, and it doesn&#x27;t leave your eyes feeling slimey.</li>
            <li> Great product for me and lasts so much longer than same amount invested in liquid remover. I also wear contacts and have allergies but no problem.</li>
            <li> Was looking for a cream based eye makeup remover.  I was using Jojoba oil and it was a bit greasy.  However, after using this product, I felt the jojoba oil did a better job removing the eye makeup so I will go back to using the Jojoba oil.  I will not be repurchasing the Neutrogena Hydrating Eye makeup remover lotion.</li>
            <li> I bought this because Neutrogena made makeup remover wipes that I really loved, the best I had every used, but no local stores carry them and they are rather expensive here on Amazon. So I tried this lotion. I wear waterproof mascara and have no issues. I put the lotion on my finger tips, and massage onto my eye lids before  washing my face with cleanser. I do not use a cosmetic ball or pad. Lightly massage and all of my eye makeup and mascara comes when I rinse my face to add cleanser. So, not saying the other people don&#x27;t have problem, I just don&#x27;t myself. So, it is great EXCEPT it loses one whole star because, in being unscented, it smells like Mod Podge, an old school crafting glue / lacquer. So I smell that every time. BUT since my eyes don&#x27;t get glued shut when I use it, I let that go because it removes my makeup so well. One other thing, very sensitive eyes, and I can have burn marks if I use too harsh of a remover. No issues since using whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Clinique makeup remover but the oily residue would cloud my vision no matter how hard I shut my eyes when trying to remove my eye makeup. I&#x27;ve been trying alternatives such as makeup remover wipes which some are ok but still very harsh on the sensitive eye area. I thought I would give this stuff a try because it was inexpensive I felt it was worth a shot. This is the BEST makeup remover I&#x27;ve ever used! It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin or eyes, feels cool and soothing when I use it and it works better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried. I use this regularly and don&#x27;t plan on switching to anything else.</li>
            <li> To me buying make up remover is almost as elusive as buying the right mascara. I never really thought about using a lotion to remove my make up before. Most products I&#x27;ve seen are liquid, so that made me a little hesitant to buy this. I dont regret buying it. The pros are that it removes my eye makeup very well. It leaves no oily feeling or residue behind- a definant plus. it works best for me if i use it to wash my face and dry it off with a cloth or towel. Without using a towel to take it off, only rinsing with water- it doesnt remove quite as much. I would definatly buy it again.</li>
            <li> Will continue to purchase this great product. It is very gentle but effectively removes makeup. And...I am a huge fan of the price!!</li>
            <li> Love this make up remover. Not oily at all.</li>
            <li> So not impressed with this eye makeup remover.  Does not take off all your makeup.  Have to really rub, which is what I want to avoid, my eye area to get most of it off but not all.  The only thing it does is moisturize but that is not my purpose for buying it.  Will not purchase this again.</li>
            <li> I used to rave about this eye makeup remover, but they must&#x27;ve changed their formula, because list last bottle that I ordered from Amazon does not work as well.</li>
            <li> For the price, this is a great makeup remover. I find it easier to apply using my fingers and rub it around for a bit to break up product. Because it&#x27;s slick, there isn&#x27;t a lot of tugging on the skin to damage or cause premature fine lines. However, it isn&#x27;t unlike any other product on the market and isn&#x27;t *exceptionally* hydrating. But it still works and I still like it, so 4/5 stars!</li>
            <li> I used to use Clinique&#x27;s lotion makeup remover until I found this product.  I love how it takes off my makeup without being greasy.  Great value too.</li>
            <li> Love this makeup remover!  Can&#x27;t find one like it in the store.  I used to use the Nivea brand of makeup remover lotion and they stopped making it.  Regular liquid removers make my eyelids so dry.  So I am so glad to have found this online!</li>
            <li> This is the best makeup remover I&#x27;ve ever used.  Very effective and yet gentle.  Highly recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price should be around $7 for 3 oz.</li>
            <li> This is the best eye makeup remover yet.  Of course, I only buy Neutrogena, but this takes everything off nicely and no oily residue.  Referred all my friends and family to this product.</li>
            <li> This cream effectively removes all kinds of eye makeup without greasiness. It doesn&#x27;t leave an oily veil behind and really gets every bit of makeup off. I use a cotton round and just a bit of the cream and it works wonders. Does not sting even if it gets in my eyes.</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic. Makeup comes off easily and this is moisturizing and leaves no oily feeling on my skin. I much prefer it to any other makeup remover. I can no longer find this in store. Amazon to the rescue!</li>
            <li> Gentle but very effective eye makeup remover.  Have been using this product for a while and will continue to re-order it.</li>
            <li> It wipes my eye makeup off well and it leaves my skin feeling very soft. It even removes my waterproof mascara. Will definitely reorder.</li>
            <li> This is the only eyemakeup remover I will use.  It gets even the most stubborn makeup off fast and without residue.</li>
            <li> Just about every eye make up remover I have tried either broke me out or burned my eyes. Been using it a week and love it</li>
            <li> This stuff doesn&#x27;t do a great job of removing eye makeup left under my eyes and burns my skin in the process. I threw it away..</li>
            <li> only remover that really works</li>
            <li> Love the way it gently takes away makeup! I have super sensitive skin (battled acne extreme in middle school,  high school and college so I have to be very selective with products I use on my face, this takes the makeup,  smells good and doesn&#x27;t make me break out!</li>
            <li> Gets anything off, even waterproof mascara, without needing to scrub. So happy I can still find this online, but I have a feeling it won&#x27;t be available much longer :(</li>
            <li> I got exactly what I wanted they are packaged nice, good products. Thank you. I would recommend.</li>
            <li> If you wonder you might buy one .Stop !!!! Is not too late .after use server day .Is never helps !!!!!! Is not working as i except .DO NOT waster  you money</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  I was looking to an alternative to the liquid remover, which is very messy.  This is very gentle on your eyes and does not leave an oily residue.  The price is good.  I&#x27;m glad that Amazon.com has this because its hard to find in the stores.</li>
            <li> I really like Neutrogena&#x27;s liquid eye makeup remover and thought this lotion version would be even better as it would provide some moisture to my sensitive eye area but this product is just too difficult to use.  It got in my eye and stung a little, I had a hard time applying it with a cotton ball or a qtip and it was just messy.</li>
            <li> I was looking for an eye makeup remover that would not sting my eyes. I had read a review that mentioned that this product might be what I was looking for. Unfortunately, this was not the one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply a pea-sized amount and wipe it off with a cotton pad. Unfortunately, I find that something of the lotion still remains no matter how long I wipe at my eyes and I have to immediately wash the eye area because my lashes feel sticky and my eyes sting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Depending on what eyeliner I was using, it did or did not remove the eyeliner well. Either that or my dark circles are too dark... It also took several applications to remove the waterproof mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, I was a bit disappointed by the purchase.</li>
            <li> Quick and easy eye makeup remover.  Takes it off quickly with no rubbing or stress to the eye.</li>
            <li> I had been using Neiva cream but they stopped making the product.  the Neutrogena product is a great replacement.  I really like the cool cream feeling on my eye lids also it does not sting your eyes.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t work. Anything removed is removed by elbow grease entirely, not this product. I use the nutrogena liquid eye makeup remover instead - it works</li>
            <li> I purchsed mine at the local grocery store on sale, but wanted to look i tup on amazon for pricing for future buys.  After getting o frustrated with trying to find a gentle eye makeup remover, i think I have found it with this product.  I&#x27;ve used all of the major dept store brands&#x27; liquid versions, but something about this light weight creme seems to go the extra mile.  Not sure why it got bad reviews here.  I love it.</li>
            <li> Nice slick, creamy texture.  Does a good job taking off eye makeup without drying out my skin or getting into my eyes.</li>
            <li> Great product. Its silky texture is amazing and it removes makeup very easily without irritating the skin. A must have.</li>
            <li> Good price; does not irritate eyes; good at removing mascara; goes a long ways.</li>
            <li> For years I used the Clinique Naturally Gentle Eye Makeup Remover Lotion, but it has become too overpriced ($18 for just 2.5 oz). I decided to find an equivalent product for a lower price and this Neutrogena makeip remover lotion is perfect.  I wear contact lenses and this lotion does not irritate at all.  I wanted a product that was not like baby oil and this is a lotion, although not too liquidy, this is a thicker lotion which works great.  It melts the eye makeup off.  From now on I will use this product.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this, but I hate it. It doesn&#x27;t do a great job at removing mascara. It did a great job at making a smeared, nasty, panda eye mess though. Eventually I did manage to remove most of my eye makeup, but it took a lot more effort than it should. But that&#x27;s not even the worst part about this. The worst part is that it burned my eyes something awful. You&#x27;d think a product made for your eyes wouldn&#x27;t hurt. It does. I do not recommend this.</li>
            <li> I read about this product and thought I would give it a try.  It works great and does not cause the redness around the eye area that I have had with many other removers.  As a bonus, this lotion gives a refreshing sensation and leaves the skin velvety soft.</li>
            <li> This is all I use. I can&#x27;t find it in stores any longer, so I buy it online. It gets my eye make-off better than any of the wet products and with minimal rubbing, which you don&#x27;t want to do around your sensitive eye skin.</li>
            <li> Great product at excellent price. This product is also good for people that travel with carry on bags, since is a 3oz container.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you&lt;br /&gt;Elizabeth</li>
            <li> This works really well for my sensitive eyes. It doesn&#x27;t burn or dry out my skin. It&#x27;s also not oily--which is great. I use a slightly damp cotton round&lt;br /&gt;(Swisspers cotton rounds) and a pea sized drop of the product, which cleans both eyes. I use regular mascara and liner and it takes it all off. I don&#x27;t know how it works for waterproof mascara or liner.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t really take off waterproof eye makeup and it burns my eyes so bad. I don&#x27;t think they carry this in stores anymore</li>
            <li> For me, this is the best eye makeup remover.  It&#x27;s a great value.  I have to buy it online now because I can&#x27;t find it in any of our local stores.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. I have very dry and delicate skin that is easily irritated. Just a pea size amount of the product gently rubbed around my eyes removes 95% of my eye make up. The mascara I use leaves a good deal of residue, and with other makeup removers two or three uses were needed to get the same effect and the skin around my eyes was left red and irritated. I will warn that since you are not using water with this product, whatever you use to wipe it off will be stained by your makeup.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a product quite like it.  I&#x27;ve used plenty of eye makeup removers, but this is completely different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s this simple.  First, get a tissue and place it in front of you.  Then, squeeze a bit from the tube and gently massage it in the eye area.  Give it a little time to work, then wipe gently with the tissue.  Eye makeup is gone, including mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Far and away the best eye makeup remover I&#x27;ve used, I can feel it absorbing into my skin, which was rather shocking, but makeup just wipes away.  Honestly, it feels like makeup should be sinking into my skin, but it isn&#x27;t.  I&#x27;ve tried it on my whole face, and it does work, but you have to use an awful lot.  If your skin is very sensitive, you might want to try this for full face makeup remover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lightweight, fragrance-free lotion is fast and effective, not to mention easy on your budget.  And it doesn&#x27;t leave a bunch of gunk around your eyes.  Two mascara wands up!</li>
            <li> Easy to use, affordable, works really well, leaves skin around my eyes feeling soft, no fragrance - what else can I say? This is a great product!</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product for people who have I have sensitive skin, it made me break out.  Plus, it didn&#x27;t work well at removing mascara.</li>
            <li> This is the only product I have ever had that takes off eye makeup without burning my eyes. It is soothing to have the creamy lotion that removes that gunk off of my eyes at the end of the day. I use it all over my face to remove all make up. I dread makeup whenever I run out this so I always make sure I have an extra on hand.</li>
            <li> This is the best of the best when it comes to taking off eye makeup and is hard to find in many stores. Why, I do not know!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use it very often, but there was a little bit of irritation when I used it maybe because I have sensitive skin. It can remove most of the makeup though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years and is easy to remove eye makeup without pulling on the eye. I tried the liquid removers but the remover pads have so many chemicals that end up in my eye and I have to use about 5 cotton pads per eye. This one never bothers my eye.</li>
            <li> This was my first time trying this product I really like it works great.</li>
            <li> Best eye makeup remover for people who have sensitive skin and wear waterproof makeup--it&#x27;s hard to find in stores so ordering here is best!</li>
            <li> I have been using Neutrogena products for a long time, and usually I am very happy with them. However, this makeup remover does not work at all! Not even on a regular mascara. I tried applying once and twice, with fingers and cotton pads, with water, in a shower, without water, it does not work. I threw it away.</li>
            <li> I tried this for my eye makeup removal--UD eyeshadow, Mary Kay mascara (NOT waterproof), and CG eyeliner. Did not work for me. The eyeshadow smeared around my face and didn&#x27;t really come off very well, the mascara turned into wet clumps on my lashes and I was scared they were going to pull off, and the eyeliner barely budged. Also, it smelled to me like plastic cucumber. It wasn&#x27;t a strong or terrible smell, but just had this unpleasant trying-to-be-fresh-but-not-succeeding kind of smell. I give it two stars, though, because it did seem rather hydrating.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best eye makeup remover.  It removes my mascara without the oil residue. It also has a great price so worth picking up more than one.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find this at the store, and I was not about to give it up!  I don&#x27;t like liquid eye makeup removers - have never had much success with them and they always feel oily.  this is a lotion, and feels very good on the eye.  Makeup is completely removed and it keeps the skin around my eyes very soft and smooth.  It arrived quickly, so I was pleased with the online purchase overall.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I was looking for a cream eye makeup remover.  It does remove my eye make up but it also dries out my eye lids.  I only use it when I wear heavier-than-usual eye make up (1-2x a week), so it isn&#x27;t intolerable.  However, I don&#x27;t think I will be able to use it in the very dry winter months at all.  When I finish this tube, I will be looking for another product.   Update:  I was originally using this on my face and then wiping it off with a cotton pad.  Now that I apply it to a wet face and wash off with water, followed by my face cleanser, I am having no trouble with it drying out my skin</li>
            <li> This a good product I must say, the creamy touch on the soft skin in an around eyes gives you a nice feeling. It removes any kind of make up, be it smoky or light and nourishes your skin.</li>
            <li> I have been trying to find an eye makeup remover that doesn&#x27;t take 10 minutes and 15 cotton balls and then only removes 85% of my eyeliner. This product had great reviews, so I tried it. No difference between this and every other grocery/drug store level product. I can never manage to get rid of all of my eyeliner without going through 4 Q-tips. Good for eye shadow only.</li>
            <li> This is really nice. You just put a dab on your ring fingers, gently rub over eye area and wipe off with a tissue.  It really gets all my makeup off, even my waterproof eyeliner comes off! Fantastic feel, very moisturized and no oily residue. Bonus, no need for cotton balls, you just use your ring finger (best ones to use for the eye areas) and wipe off with a tissue. It&#x27;s WAY cheaper than those expensive bi-phasic cleansers, and it feels great!</li>
            <li> I received only one single bottle, instead of two as shown in picture. You charged me the total amount. n</li>
            <li> Looking for a replacement for the Oil of Olay product, that I paid $4.99 for and now see online for $40...  This will do the trick!</li>
            <li> This product did not work.. It burned my eyes and did not take off my mascara.. I would never buy again.. Also i feel like allot of these reviews are fake. I am going to stop buying products from amazon</li>
            <li> Put a tiny drop on a cotton ball as suggested by the label and it still got in my eye and I saw blurry for about an hour after - even after flushing with water. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s probably fine if you don&#x27;t get it in your eyes but I&#x27;m too scared to use it now.</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping to reduce the amount of friction applied to the eye area when removing eye makeup. This is not the case at all. This product only manages to smear the mascara unto the skin.</li>
            <li> I prefer Avon eye makeup remover over this.</li>
            <li> I adore this make up remover because it doesn&#x27;t require me to wash after washing. One swipe of the cleaner removes all eye make up without needing to remove oil a second time.</li>
            <li> Got this based upon the reviews on another website.  Very creamy and does not cause eye irritation.  Wish it worked a little better, bur can&#x27;t say it is this remover as I started using a new mascara and the new mascara may be one of those that just doesn&#x27;t want to come off!  Overall, satisfied with product, good value for the money.</li>
            <li> GREAT EYE MAKE UP REMOVER</li>
            <li> This a wonderful product. I have been using it for years and cannot find it in most drugstores so when I found it online I was thrilled.  Easy on the eyes and takes mascara and eye shadow off with no trouble at all.  Wash or rinse off and no greasy residue left behind.</li>
            <li> It am very pleased with this product.  It helps remove eye makeup without drying my skin.  I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work at great as I wanted it to, but it does work.</li>
            <li> I want to get thins one for my eye makeup remover, and it doesn&#x27;t hurt eye, but a little bit unsatisified is that it doesn&#x27;t remove all my eye makeup, sometimes I have to use another product to get over it</li>
            <li> This is the only eye makeup remover I will ever use! I was so sad when I couldn&#x27;t find it on the shelves of ANY stores - not at the grocery store, WalMart, or Target! I thought maybe it had been discontinued but I was so happy when I found it online! It&#x27;s so nice because it lasts a long time, is fragrance-free, and it&#x27;s very gentle; you don&#x27;t have to scrub and scrape with a cotton ball, so you won&#x27;t have to lose any eyelashes trying to get your mascara out. Leaves your eyes feeling fine and it removes the makeup super duper well! I love it, and hope this product never gets discontinued.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve searched high and low and this is the best eye makeup remover I&#x27;ve found to date.  I have sensitive skin around my eyes which get irritated by every product (even sensitive skin ones) I&#x27;ve tried except this one.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> So impressed with this ! I use to use baby oil !which was way to messy and hard to remove . I love this ! It goes on easily and I wipe it off with a tissue . I can not believe how well it takes off my eye makeup.  I noticed my under eyes getting a little dry from using soap sometimes to remove my makeup... But this helps to moisturize my skin as well . Which is such a plus ,! It even removes my Benefit &#x27;they&#x27;re real&#x27; masacara n eye liner ! I haven&#x27;t tried it on any waterproof eye makeup though ... It is a little oiliy if u get in your eye! I mean but that&#x27;s expec with anything ... But not as bad as baby oil... Keep eyes closed super tight n remove makeup quickly...</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t care for this stuff AT ALL. I got it after reading reviews and the liquid makeup remover is 10000times better. I will not buy this again. It does remove makeup well but the liquid remover is just easier.</li>
            <li> Gentle, mild, effective.</li>
            <li> This product claims you can wipe away the make up and leave on the excess.&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s just say, it smears the eyeliner around and doesn&#x27;t remove mascara. Mind you, I don&#x27;t use waterproof.&lt;br /&gt;Also, leaving on the &amp;#34;excess&amp;#34; is not such a great idea. It burns my eyes after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE BEST. I use this everyday to take off my eye makeup. Routine as follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Smear remover all over eyes, making sure to get it onto eye lashes (please note the lack of burning)&lt;br /&gt;2. Prepare for shower (during this time the remover is dissolving my waterproof mascara)&lt;br /&gt;3. Enter shower, use normal makeup remover cleanser all over face.&lt;br /&gt;4. Exit shower, use towel on face.&lt;br /&gt;5. NO MASCARA STAINS.</li>
            <li> After reading the raving reviews about this i ordered... Well for me the product is not as effective as the liquid one. I need for cotton balls to remove my eye make up versus 1 with the liquid... Will happily continue to use the Neutrogena Eye MR in liquid form.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for an eye makeup remover that doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes or cause dryness after using, and I&#x27;ve finally found it!  It removes the eye makeup beautifully.  It&#x27;s light and creamy, just perfect.</li>
            <li> I like this product because I do not have to get my face wet and can just massage the lotion over my face.  It gently removed all my makeup including mascara and waterproof liquid liner.  Once everything melts off I just wash it away with water.</li>
            <li> it removes makeup gentely, it burns a little bit if it goes into your eyes, but it is really good</li>
            <li> i can take my eyemakeup off with this stuff without ruing the rest of my face!&lt;br /&gt;its so moist and soothing to my eyes i love it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, but liquid products work bettere and are easier on the skin around the eyes.</li>
            <li> This is the best eye makeup remover on the market, it&#x27;s also very gentle.  I love this product !! :-)</li>
            <li> This product is by far the best eye makeup remover that I have ever used.  I wear a lot of eye make up.  It&#x27;s gentle, it&#x27;s just creamy and light enough to not be heavy, and still cleans well without having to apply it many many times.  Three times should do it depending on how much eye make up you use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; it doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes.  Most of the liquids feel like I am applying alcohol to my eyes and it&#x27;s extremely unpleasant.  The pads that are saturated don&#x27;t have enough moisture in them and the process has to be repeated many times,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this product you can control the amount you need, a dot, or more, and it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t been able to find this in any drugstore and I&#x27;m grateful to find it on Amazon....where else. One can always depend on Amazon!!</li>
            <li> Works great! I don&#x27;t wear waterproof eye makeup, but it easily and quickly removes everything.</li>
            <li> Works at getting my mascara off when other makeup removers fail.</li>
            <li> Very think and it takes a lot of motion to get non water proof mascara off. I don&#x27;t think it worth the money. Liquids are easier and quicker.</li>
            <li> Best eye makeup remover ever - light, dissolves makeup effectively, very creamy so easy to use. I have a very sensitive skin, I use it for the face as well, works great. Love it.</li>
            <li> I have used a liquid eye makeup remover for years but in planning for a vacation I decided to take this on the trip as the liquid always seems to leak out of the container with air travel and makes a mess. Not only is the lotion perfect for travel - no mess - it feels so good when taking off eye makeup. I use a regular mascara and eyeliner which are both removed very easily and effectively. I prefer this to the liquid. I will purchase lotion going forward.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t remove eye makeup</li>
            <li> I really love it,. there is no other options to choose from, because it is the best. removes make up  perfectly without any allergic reactions, on the skin feels no grease, but soft with some tightening of skin, fresh and clean... I love so much!</li>
            <li> I have used this for a long time and I love it.  I like that it is in lotion  form and easy on  my eyes.</li>
            <li> I wear makeup daily, so I also need to remove it daily---I used &amp;#34;Almay&amp;#34; until it was gone, and discontinued, and tried this.  I&#x27;m not impressed.  Now, I&#x27;m on the search for a great makeup remover.</li>
            <li> Over the years I have tried several different types and brands of eye makeup remover products and was always disappointed so I just started and kept using a gentle face wash for that. That is no longer an option due to being allergic to things or my eyes being irritated and very dry from that. I love this stuff because it works! I hate the oily liquid eye makeup removers, this stuff leaves your eyes alone! It does not irritate my eyes after i use it, the dryness has improved right away,and gets it off with usually one application, I just use my finger so there is no tugging on your eye at all. Waterproof eyeliner, etc does require a little more product but it does remove it. I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 because it said you don&#x27;t need to rinse it off but I do because I tried that once and it gets inside your eye and burns.</li>
            <li> read the reviews and that is what convinced me to purchase this product.  I must say, I am very happy with it.  I used to use an &#x27;oil&#x27; base eye-make up remover, and it always lingered in the lashes and then my eyes.  This rinses off easy, and is very gently to the eyes. and takes off all the eye make up.  if there is a little left after washing face, I just use a little on a q-tip and run under the eyes.  it&#x27;s easy to control the amount to use because of the small opening on the tube.  Very happy with product and will order again.</li>
            <li> I love Neutrogena products, however, this eye makeup remover did not work for me.  I wear waterproof mascara and this product does not take it all off.  Would probably be ok with regular mascara.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin so I have to be super careful about what I use to remove my make-up (oddly enough, I wear a lot!) This &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34; is amazing at removing little to heavy eye make-up.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and can&#x27;t tell you how disappointed I was I could no longer find this in any store.... walmart, walgreens, CVS, HEB (Texas grocery) or Target.  I kept trying and couldn&#x27;t find it on the shelves and had to try a few others and found them to be very harsh and very alcholicic.  I wasn&#x27;t able to use them... finally gave in and purchased online.  I am a committed user for over 3 years and will continue.</li>
            <li> Best eye makeup remover out there! The liquid remover makes my eyes puffy and red. I was so happy when I tried this and it worked! Have been a user for 3 years now and I am never changing products!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d irritated my eye lids with cleansers and yanked out about most of my eyelashes trying to remove eye makeup.  This product saved the day. Its non irritating and moisturizing, does not sting.</li>
            <li> This is pretty effective at removing eye makeup. I take mine off using this with a cotton round-- I still have to work at it. And for being something that is made to use on the sensitive eye area... this really BURNS.</li>
            <li> Love this!  Removes makeup easily, even the waterproof kind.  It&#x27;s a little hard to get waterproof mascara off of thick lashes, so I use a toothbrush and this.  Works!</li>
            <li> Love this eye makeup remover. Does not dry out my eyes as the previous one I was using.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! It&#x27;s the best eye makeup remover I&#x27;ve found so far and order it online because it can be hard to find locally.</li>
            <li> I am a regular with this product.</li>
            <li> I used to use Clinique cream eye makeup remover but this works just as well. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes and because it&#x27;s a cream, it&#x27;s a gentle way to remove eye makeup. It&#x27;s a staple product for me.</li>
            <li> I love this makeup remover.  It&#x27;s the best!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Wish I could find it in stores.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena Hydrating Eye Makeup Remover Lotion works very well, without irritation.</li>
            <li> My go-to eye makeup remover for years was Olay Regenerist Eye Makeup Remover. Recently, it became unavailable, so I was looking for a similar product to remove waterproof mascara, which I wear every day. I didn&#x27;t want to use baby oil because it&#x27;s too oily and hard to wash off the residue. So, with high hopes, I tried this product, and I was not disappointed! This stuff is awesome!!! It quickly and easily removed my waterproof mascara and left the eye area soft, without a greasy residue. I find it works best when applied with a tissue rather than using my fingers, and holding the tissue with the product on my lashes for a few seconds to soften the mascara before wiping it off. Gets all the mascara off without yanking out any eyelashes. :)</li>
            <li> It is not easy to find an eye makeup remover that removes mascara but does not leave your eyes oily or itchy.  This lotion is more of a cream, thick and easier to apply and remove than products that are more liquid.  I love the way it leaves my lashes clean yet not oily nor dry.  A small amount does the trick.  Also, the price is beyond belief especially when compared to the other quality brand products in department stores or even on line.  For a fraction of the cost you have the same results and I did not have to bother with driving to the mall, parking etc.  My order arrived just a few days after I ordered it.</li>
            <li> would recommend this to every one with sensitive eyes I also use it to remove makeup from my face. Leaves it well hydrated and soft to  touch</li>
            <li> I had a makeup remover lotion long ago and it was discontinued.  I haven&#x27;t found anything comparable to that since...until now!  Gentle removes makeup without leaving an oily residue and does not break out my face.</li>
            <li> Made my vision blurry even though I did not get any in my eyes!</li>
            <li> Takes the make-up off but burns my eyes. I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> This product removes all of my eye makeup, even better than my old standby, Neutrogena Oil-Free Eye Makeup Remover. I wear waterproof eyeliner, smudgeproof mascara and long-wearing foundation and eyeshadow primer. With the other eye makeup remover I used, there would some be left-over mascara or eyeliner. This stuff removes absolutely everything. I&#x27;m wondering if the people who are having trouble are using it correctly. I squirt a little bit (maybe a pea-sized amount) on my fingertip, then I apply it in a circular motion all over my lid. I let it sit for a few seconds (10-15), then wipe it off. It takes a couple wipes to get it all off, but only one actual application of the lotion. I&#x27;ve also been using a cloth instead of cotton pads. Other eye makeup remover lotions I&#x27;ve used haven&#x27;t worked well, but this is amazing stuff, and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I used Oil of Olay Regenerist Eye Makeup Remover / Eye Cream for years.  I stocked up on it when I heard it was discontinued and just recently ran out of my last bottle.  I may have cried a little.  I have tried at least ten different eye make up removers trying to find a replacement since then and this is the closest I have found to it.  This takes off most of my makeup with one or two swipes, but I will say that sometimes the next morning I have dark circles again from remaining mascara and have to apply again.  Still, I like that you can add it to a cotton pad and swipe without it feeling like your eye gets scratched from the fibers and it is very gentle if it does happen to get in your eye.  I have to use a little more than I did with the Oil of Olay but this is definitely a good replacement.</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed when I could  no longer find this product in local retail stores. So, obviously I was very pleased when I discovered it was available here on amazon. This removes eye makeup gently and with no oily residue! It is a lotion consistency which also makes it hydrating. Love it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find this in my hometown.  I occasionally get psorias on my eyelids. Most mascara removers incites psorias.  This one is gentle.  I have used it for three years and the psorias has not come back.</li>
            <li> This remover is soooo worth it!  It is without a doubt, one of the best eye makeup remover I have used.</li>
            <li> I really love this! It does the job and it feels so cool, smooth, clean when I use it (just a few drops on a cotton ball does the trick), not sticky or thick. It definitely moisturizes well and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin dry at all. I&#x27;m amazed at how long I&#x27;ve been able to strech just one tube of this stuff! Great bang for your buck!</li>
            <li> I always hate the oily eye-makeup removers that I try. Even the &amp;#34;oil free&amp;#34; still feel oily to me. Plus, I think a rip out a few eyelashes getting my mascara off with those products as well. This works great, has no residue, and feels moisturizing. This is definitely my favorite remover product and I&#x27;ve tried ones from Lancome, Clinique, etc.</li>
            <li> The best eye makeup remover I have ever tried. Creamy consistency removes mascara so gentle and easy. Definitely the best out there.</li>
