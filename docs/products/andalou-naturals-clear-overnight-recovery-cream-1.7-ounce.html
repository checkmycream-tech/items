            <li>All of the Andalou Naturals products smell so good.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s also REALLY good.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with this product and can&#x27;t wait to try out the scrub that came with it.</li>
            <li>I put it on right before I went to bed and woke up with very happy and hydrated skin.</li>
            <li>I love the way it smells!</li>
            <li>I love them all!</li>
            <li>Surprisingly, Andalou products not only feel great on the skin and don&#x27;t irritate it, but also smell just wonderfully, without a hint of chemicals.</li>
            <li>this product line works amazing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thinking about purchasing the Andalou Naturals Rose Oil or Overnight mask to compensate.</li>
            <li>it smells really good too. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I have had to be patient..just being completely honest..</li>
            <li>This cream has a great texture and a fresh lemony smell.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>and I love the results.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like I wake up with better skin every day.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it every day, giving preference to non-comedonic organic oils and oil mixtures like rosehip (top fav), sea buckthorn, raspberry seed and argan.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to anyone who has problematic skin who can&#x27;t find something to soothe it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy :)</li>
            <li>I think a couple more weeks of this product</li>
            <li>My skin has never been better.</li>

            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Also love the scent.</li>
            <li>I tend to break out and this one is pretty light and doesn&#x27;t clog the pores, which is great.</li>
            <li>It smells great, does not leave my face oily and my face looks and feels soft in the morning.  </li>
            <li>Full of good stuff and smells so fresh.</li>
            <li>this has made a huge difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>I received a free lemon sugar face scrub...</li>
            <li>This cream really does work magic overnight.</li>
            <li>very sensitive skin and most of commercial and many organic products cause a reaction, I&#x27;ve tried so many things.</li>
            <li>Visible changes within the first use!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s only been one day and my skin already looks better!</li>
            <li>my routine is to wash with an organic cleanser (kiss my face potent and pure &amp;#34;start up&amp;#34; wash), scrub gently with a washcloth, and then put this on.</li>
            <li>I ended up buying a few creams for me and my mom, and they all worked out great.</li>
            <li>so fresh............</li>
            <li>but it is totally worth it.</li>
            <li>but it is totally worth it.</li>
            <li>It melts right into the skin without any greasiness.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m 26 now) and this cream really seems to help!</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>I had normal mild acne.</li>
            <li>which ones are responsible for any skin improvement.</li>
            <li>I used just this cream the first night, after washing with my normal face wash, and felt a difference.</li>
            <li>I have since expanded to using the Andalou clarifying willow bark toner day and night, as well as the spot treatment, and am really liking those as well.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>but I really had to for this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 24 now, and this is the first time EVER I have been using natural over the counter products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 24 now, and this is the first time EVER I have been using natural over the counter products.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive, combination, very acne prone skin, and have used everything from Proactiv, Philopshy, to dermatologist prescriptions, with no changes really.</li>
            <li>I seriously NEVER write reviews..</li>
            <li>I always went to the dermotolgists and used everything from topical oinments, retinoids, steroids,  many topical antibiotics.</li>
            <li>I was pleased that I saw a little improvement.</li>
            <li>I slather it on my face at night and wake up to smooth skin that is not at all greasy which leads me to think that it&#x27;s being absorbed really well compared to other brands that are still on my face the next day.</li>
            <li>This is another very luxurious, natural product by Andalou Naturals.</li>
            <li>even after the first night, i woke up and my skin looked not only clearer but so much healthier.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, especially in the winter when my skin is so dry.</li>
            <li>We have a family farm/ranch and are outside whenever it&#x27;s light out, and this does not dry out our skin.</li>
            <li>I started using a bunch of new skin products</li>
            <li>I started seeing results with this line nearly immediately!  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to live completely dependent on these things.</li>
            <li>The clear skin kit took about a month to clear up his skin and completely erase all scarring.</li>
            <li>i have a ton of skin problems: wrinkles, acne, and oily/dry/irritated sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works when using the Clarifying line overall.  </li>
            <li>and my skin is looking clearer and scars are lighter and makes my skin so soft.</li>
            <li>It is very dependent on using daily.</li>
            <li>I want to try to keep this concise.</li>
            <li>My skin was CONSTANTLY flaky and super dry..</li>
            <li>I have been suffering from perioral dermititis for a couple years now..throughout middle school and high school</li>
            <li>The only problem is the free sugar scrub was missing out of the package.</li>
            <li>my skin didn&#x27;t just clear up from one day to the next.</li>
            <li>and I will finally have cleared up my skin completely.</li>
            <li>and I will finally have cleared up my skin completely.</li>
            <li>my skin is finally getting back to normal.</li>
            <li>all but still that&#x27;s kind of creepy that someone pocketed it before shipping.</li>
            <li>Again, I was very embarassed of my skin because I was already extremely red and irritated and from overusing many of the wrong products</li>
            <li>I mean it was free and</li>
            <li>well know natural line (that is much more expensive) and my face was just not clearing up.  </li>
            <li>and my face has never been this clear for so long, even through hormones and stress.</li>
            <li>I have been very consistent using this every single night for a little over a month now.</li>
            <li>This product doesn&#x27;t break me out as far as I can tell, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s moisturizing enough for my dry skin as the weather gets colder.</li>

            <li> and I usually can only wash with water, use honey as a mask, and do coconut oil to moisturize, but that is a bit greasy and it hasn&#x27;t really helped my skin yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You can SEE the difference, as long as you use it on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> I am use to and need a heavier lotion for overall my skin is dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d see results for a few days and then all of my problems, or worse yet new problems, would start right back up.</li>
            <li> Basically through long term and consistent use of oral antibiotics and steroids my skin became addicted to these products.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve only had this cream for a day, but I can say that it is soothing, and my skin is not dry and peeling or breaking out like usual.  </li>
            <li> Recently, I purchased the clay mask, and I hope that it will continue to amaze me, like the other products I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
            <li> Perioral dermitis is an extrememly frustrating skin condition, because unlike normal acne, it is not simple to treat.</li>
            <li> It was EXTREMELY hard for me to cut everything out and go the &#x27;natural&#x27; way..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve actually started using quite a few of Andalou&#x27;s products since they seem to work so well.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not certain</li>
            <li> I even use a little under my sunscreen during the day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few months now</li>
            <li> Of course, I figured the results would go away after a few days.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> Sorry I didn&#x27;t keep this short like I intended.</li>
            <li> Sorry I didn&#x27;t keep this short like I intended.</li>
            <li> Together, the line seems to work as well (if not better) for my problem skin (life-long acne) as the prescription benzoyl peroxide/Retin-A/clindamycin regimen I was using before.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving credit to the probiotic complex in the products, as everything else is something I&#x27;ve tried in the past.</li>
            <li> seriously it will be the hardest thing of your life to give everything up</li>
            <li> seriously it will be the hardest thing of your life to give everything up</li>
            <li> If your skin is inflamed and you suddenly break out, this one will remove up to 80% of the bad stuff during the night.</li>
            <li> If you are like me and are addicted to the dermatologist and prescription products...</li>
            <li> If you are like me and are addicted to the dermatologist and prescription products...</li>
            <li> Weird.</li>
            <li> My skin has been horrible lately: so dry, peeling, some acne, eczema, and also sort of oily at times.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love the way it smells! All of the Andalou Naturals products smell so good. I started using a bunch of new skin products all at once so I&#x27;m not certain which ones are responsible for any skin improvement. This product doesn&#x27;t break me out as far as I can tell, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s moisturizing enough for my dry skin as the weather gets colder. I&#x27;m thinking about purchasing the Andalou Naturals Rose Oil or Overnight mask to compensate.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks.  It smells great, does not leave my face oily and my face looks and feels soft in the morning.  I even use a little under my sunscreen during the day.</li>
            <li> Outstanding cream - great value!  I&#x27;ll definitely order again.</li>
            <li> this has made a huge difference in my skin. even after the first night, i woke up and my skin looked not only clearer but so much healthier. i have a ton of skin problems: wrinkles, acne, and oily/dry/irritated sensitive skin. my routine is to wash with an organic cleanser (kiss my face potent and pure &amp;#34;start up&amp;#34; wash), scrub gently with a washcloth, and then put this on. it smells really good too. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few months now and I love the results. It&#x27;s like I wake up with better skin every day. I&#x27;ve had acne almost all my life (I&#x27;m 26 now) and this cream really seems to help! Visible changes within the first use!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only been one day and my skin already looks better! I put it on right before I went to bed and woke up with very happy and hydrated skin. I am very satisfied with this product and can&#x27;t wait to try out the scrub that came with it.</li>
            <li> Very nice gel like cream,&lt;br /&gt;Good for oil skin&lt;br /&gt;I use it after shower with the toner from the same brand</li>
            <li> Wanted an all-natural moisturizer that will balance my skin and it did the trick.  I got the toner and the day cream as well.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works when using the Clarifying line overall.  I use the face wash, toner and this cream at night - face wash, toner and clarifying BB Cream during the day.  The combination of these works wonders!  I had been using another well know natural line (that is much more expensive) and my face was just not clearing up.  I started seeing results with this line nearly immediately!  Hope they never stop making this!</li>
            <li> Full of good stuff and smells so fresh. Very moisturizing!</li>
            <li> I bought this product on a whim, having tried everything on the market for my problematic skin. I have sensitive, combination, very acne prone skin, and have used everything from Proactiv, Philopshy, to dermatologist prescriptions, with no changes really. I&#x27;d see results for a few days and then all of my problems, or worse yet new problems, would start right back up. I used just this cream the first night, after washing with my normal face wash, and felt a difference. It smelled amazing too! Of course, I figured the results would go away after a few days. I am a month in and my face has never been this clear for so long, even through hormones and stress. I have since expanded to using the Andalou clarifying willow bark toner day and night, as well as the spot treatment, and am really liking those as well. Recently, I purchased the clay mask, and I hope that it will continue to amaze me, like the other products I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
            <li> I use every product from andalou, I have body wash, shampoo, conditioner as well as all of the clairifying line and some of the brightening. Chemicals and me do not get along. I love them all! This cream is great! I have used the citrus kombucha wash, aloe + willow bark toner and over night recovery cream for about a week now and have had no breakouts from it and my skin is looking clearer and scars are lighter and makes my skin so soft. I have oily skin and this product line works amazing. It is summer so I wonder if winter maybe to drying. I recommend this line to everyone.</li>
            <li> UPD: This cream really does work magic overnight. If your skin is inflamed and you suddenly break out, this one will remove up to 80% of the bad stuff during the night. I don&#x27;t use it every day, giving preference to non-comedonic organic oils and oil mixtures like rosehip (top fav), sea buckthorn, raspberry seed and argan. But the cream is irreplaceable when it comes to pre-period breakouts or sudden winter draught. I simply adore it.  I ordered this one to try out after sampling it at some organic store. I have very sensitive skin and most of commercial and many organic products cause a reaction, I&#x27;ve tried so many things. Surprisingly, Andalou products not only feel great on the skin and don&#x27;t irritate it, but also smell just wonderfully, without a hint of chemicals. I ended up buying a few creams for me and my mom, and they all worked out great. This cream has a great texture and a fresh lemony smell. It&#x27;s also thicker than the day creams (I&#x27;ve got the one from the 1000 roses line) so it&#x27;s a great nightly moisturizer. I tend to break out and this one is pretty light and doesn&#x27;t clog the pores, which is great.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best....... smells like oranges..... so fresh............love it!!</li>
            <li> I sent this cream to my daughter in England. She loves it. Her skin is softer and it&#x27;s helping to fade recent acne marks. The only problem is the free sugar scrub was missing out of the package. I mean it was free and all but still that&#x27;s kind of creepy that someone pocketed it before shipping. Weird.</li>
            <li> This is another very luxurious, natural product by Andalou Naturals. It melts right into the skin without any greasiness. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I just bought this cream by chance.  My skin has been horrible lately: so dry, peeling, some acne, eczema, and also sort of oily at times.  I am 32.  Everything irritates it and I usually can only wash with water, use honey as a mask, and do coconut oil to moisturize, but that is a bit greasy and it hasn&#x27;t really helped my skin yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only had this cream for a day, but I can say that it is soothing, and my skin is not dry and peeling or breaking out like usual.  It is the perfect balance.  I would recommend it to anyone who has problematic skin who can&#x27;t find something to soothe it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy :)</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, especially in the winter when my skin is so dry. I slather it on my face at night and wake up to smooth skin that is not at all greasy which leads me to think that it&#x27;s being absorbed really well compared to other brands that are still on my face the next day.</li>
            <li> You can SEE the difference, as long as you use it on a regular basis. It is very dependent on using daily. I&#x27;ve had great results when sticking to a skincare regimen, but have seen an increase in break outs if I don&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> I seriously NEVER write reviews..but I really had to for this product. I want to try to keep this concise. I have been suffering from perioral dermititis for a couple years now..throughout middle school and high school I had normal mild acne. I always went to the dermotolgists and used everything from topical oinments, retinoids, steroids,  many topical antibiotics. Basically through long term and consistent use of oral antibiotics and steroids my skin became addicted to these products. I promised myself that after my wedding I had to get myself off of all these products..I didn&#x27;t want to live completely dependent on these things. It was EXTREMELY hard for me to cut everything out and go the &#x27;natural&#x27; way..because as soon as anything came up on my skin I would freak out. I did a TON of research before I purchased this product..and again I&#x27;m one of those people who has used a million different things on my skin. This product has done wonders for me. I have had to be patient..just being completely honest..my skin didn&#x27;t just clear up from one day to the next. I have been very consistent using this every single night for a little over a month now. I also just purchased one of andalou&#x27;s exfoliating masks...and it&#x27;s also REALLY good. Again, I didn&#x27;t see instant perfection..but I can see each morning when I woke up I was pleased that I saw a little improvement. The overall texture of my skin has improved. Perioral dermitis is an extrememly frustrating skin condition, because unlike normal acne, it is not simple to treat. My skin had what appeared to look like pimples but they were not. I had very red bumps all over one side of my cheek close to my mouth. It appears like a rash. Again, I was very embarassed of my skin because I was already extremely red and irritated and from overusing many of the wrong products I just kept aggravating and drying up my skin. This product also helps with dryness. My skin was CONSTANTLY flaky and super dry..my skin is finally getting back to normal. I think a couple more weeks of this product and I will finally have cleared up my skin completely. If you are like me and are addicted to the dermatologist and prescription products...seriously it will be the hardest thing of your life to give everything up but it is totally worth it. I started seeing a dermatolgist and receiving acne/dermititis prescriptions when I was about 15 or 16. I&#x27;m 24 now, and this is the first time EVER I have been using natural over the counter products. My skin has never been better. Sorry I didn&#x27;t keep this short like I intended. I just wanted to give some background of my skin struggle.normal. I think a couple more weeks of this product and I will finally have cleared up my skin completely.

            <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks now and I love it. I&#x27;ve actually started using quite a few of Andalou&#x27;s products since they seem to work so well. I started with the Citrus Kombucha Cleansing Gel and then worked in the day and night creams. Now I also have a toner, toning refresher, and the Apricot Cream Cleanser. Together, the line seems to work as well (if not better) for my problem skin (life-long acne) as the prescription benzoyl peroxide/Retin-A/clindamycin regimen I was using before. I&#x27;m giving credit to the probiotic complex in the products, as everything else is something I&#x27;ve tried in the past. I will DEFINITELY keep purchasing this and the rest of them as well. Oh! And it smells yummy too!</li>
            <li> My brother has problem skin at 19. He has tried almost everything from proactive to prescription. nothing. The clear skin kit took about a month to clear up his skin and completely erase all scarring. Couldn&#x27;t believe it!!! Now we all use this under our daily dose of sunscreen. We have a family farm/ranch and are outside whenever it&#x27;s light out, and this does not dry out our skin. Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> My skin is glowing.... Look healthier and will be staying with this link e. I received a free lemon sugar face scrub... Awesome ... I recommend this. I am use to and need a heavier lotion for overall my skin is dry. But this does the job</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t break out my combination, acne prone skin. Hydrates well - I use it both day and night. Also love the scent.</li>
