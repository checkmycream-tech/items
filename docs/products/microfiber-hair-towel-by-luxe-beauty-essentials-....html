            <li>Not as absorbent as I would&#x27;ve liked.</li>
            <li>I also like to use this towel when I am doing my own at home spa treatment.</li>

            <li>/&gt;Overall this towel is so nice that I am considering purchasing additional ones to give as holiday gifts.</li>
            <li>All opinions are my own.</li>
            <li>I was given one of these hair towels to try out and offer my honest opinion.  </li>
            <li>I received this product in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;(I was provided a sample for review purposes; my opinions are my own based on my experience with this product.)</li>
            <li>/&gt;The incredible absorbency and the generous size make it an excellent choice for wrapping wet hair or even for drying baby at bathtime.  </li>
            <li>I put it on after getting out of the shower, stays on nicely.</li>
            <li>wash warm, tumble dry&lt;</li>
            <li>and  I must say a very wonderful company to deal with by far!!!</li>
            <li>That is okay though, it still sits very comfortably on my head!</li>
            <li>Washing this is very easy.</li>
            <li>On the contrary, this is one of the most effective drying cloths or towels I have ever used.&lt;br</li>
            <li>, it is so soft and feels wonderful on my head.  </li>
            <li>And Kristen offers great customer service as always!</li>
            <li>She is very happy with the towel, she is no longer using the dryer, with our 2 year old</li>
            <li>The soft ends are perfect for wiping sweat off your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Well, maybe, because I love, love, love this one!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light weight</li>
            <li>It feels wonderful – very soft and scratch free.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was able to receive this product for testing for being a precious member of the company.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>love this towel.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad that I chose to give it a try and a review.</li>
            <li>but this is proof that there are more absorbent materials that can be utilized.</li>
            <li>Hopefully see more colors</li>
            <li>This product was provided to me free for the purpose of inspection and my honest unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li>but it sure did.</li>
            <li>Love it or your money back.\\&quot;...</li>
            <li>well, we already love it so no issue here.</li>
            <li>However, if something wacky happens to change that opinion, I will return here to update the review and let you know what the issue was and how resolution was handled.</li>
            <li>Love the size and everything about this towel.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m sure I don&#x27;t accidentally toss in it with a load that I added fabric softener to.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m getting better with time.</li>

            <li>It felt more like a spa treatment than anything; I would envision myself using a towel this plush at a salon or any sort of spa.</li>
            <li>way more than what it costs.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This has to be better for my hair.  </li>
            <li>, I am once again completely satisfied and confident to share my feedback.</li>

            <li>After purchasing their great Hydracentials bottle, I jumped at a chance to try other products.&lt;br /&gt;The towel feels great</li>

            <li>/&gt;*Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
            <li>It is so comfortable and easy to use, and kept my hair piled on top of my head all throughout the night.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall it is a very good hair towel and is of really high quality; all for a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Very nice quality by far</li>
            <li>It is easy to wash, and holds up to quite a bit of abuse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The shape and weight makes it so easy to wrap up your hair, turban style.</li>
            <li>Care is easy:  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightweight, easy to use, and makes me feel like I&#x27;m at a spa when I get out of the shower.</li>
            <li>I can wrap around my head easily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nothing special but it&#x27;s better than using my husband&#x27;s ripped up t-shirts.</li>
            <li>It is soooo soft and nice!</li>
            <li>The size and shape works perfectly for any hair length (I don&#x27;t have a lot of hair on top, but some on the sides - it works for me; my wife has lovely shoulder length thick hair</li>
            <li>So with a great sense of relief I am able to throw away the old and replace it with an even better new!!</li>
            <li>It is easy to fit into a gym bag and it air-drys very quickly.</li>
            <li>By contrast this is huge and easily covered all of my hair.</li>
            <li>Although I was provided this for free to test, I would have easily bought this.</li>
            <li>Because it is microfiber, it dries incredibly quickly!</li>
            <li>According to her, these things are amazingly absorbent, perfectly sized to wrap around your wet head, and are very soft and durable.</li>
            <li>As a customer of other products from this company,i am so glad to get this product to be able to use it and get the true joy of having my child and me cherish parenting.</li>
            <li>We did receive this great towel gratis from the seller and have put it through the paces to objectively find out how well it performed.</li>
            <li>again, here is a thoughtful product that is made with the consumer&#x27;s well being in mind.</li>
            <li>It does all that it claims, and I enjoy using it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>received this free for review purposes.</li>
            <li>It would be perfect if it was just a few inches longer for my needs.  </li>
            <li>monitory compensation was received ( i was given the product free to review with no intention on compensation).</li>
            <li>got this free for review</li>
            <li>Instructions for claiming a free microfiber face cloth are provided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is soft and nice to use, on top of doing its job</li>
            <li>Really, how many more uses can I find for this towel.</li>
            <li>I managed to make it work, and it&#x27;s easier to use than a full size towel, but not as easy as I wanted.</li>
            <li>nicely done, and I would highly recommend this.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I often end up returning to my original towels in frustration.</li>
            <li>I was really excited to try this hair towel.  </li>
            <li>so you could bleach it clean.  </li>
            <li>It’s also hugely absorbent, soaking up water quickly and holding it</li>
            <li>Replacing all my towels to this type because they are great to dry off with.  </li>
            <li>Works amazing for drying natural hair before air drying.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ridiculously soft and the perfect size for my long hair.</li>
            <li>It’s a bright white color.</li>
            <li>It works great to finish drying my hair and also as a wrap for my wet</li>
            <li>my opinion, it is because it is more gently on the hair.  </li>
            <li>The hype is true.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair and don&#x27;t like to use the blow dryer very much because of heat damage.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s quick drying qualities, it dries out in practically no time when hung across a shower rod.</li>
            <li>It dries your hair quickly.</li>
            <li>The towel air dries quickly.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this material and would LOVE a larger version to use as a gym towel!</li>
            <li>It dries my hair quite well and dries itself out quickly.</li>
            <li>The towel itself also dries fairly quickly, too, when you&#x27;re done with</li>
            <li>Super absorbent.</li>
            <li>It dries my hair quickly and allows me to brush and comb before I head out the door, even when I&#x27;m in a hurry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>did receive this product for free but the experience and opinions are my own and my only compensation was this product.</li>
            <li>It is just the right size, does an amazing job of drying my hair even faster than my old towel, and my hair does not seem as frizzy.</li>
            <li>Wash as normal, but be sure NOT to use fabric softener with this.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t stress how much better this towel is than any normal bath towel..</li>
            <li>The towel was not soaked after my shower like a normal bath towel, even though it had removed most of the water and moisture from my hair.</li>
            <li>urge you to wash and dry this towel before using to allow it to work with optimum results.</li>
            <li>size means it will be easy to pack and take on my trips -- instead of relying on hotel towels, I&#x27;ll have something that works much</li>
            <li>so I could better wrap my hair and still have enough room to tuck in the end easily.  </li>
            <li>My hair is super soft and tangle free!.  </li>
            <li>I love the super soft fabric this is made of.</li>
            <li>The Luxe Beauty Microfiber Hair Towel did an excellent job of leaving my hair much more dry by morning, and even less unruly!</li>
            <li>I really love this soft hair towel.</li>
            <li>This towel feels so nice on the skin and dries me off completely unlike most regular towels.  </li>
            <li>soft and absorbent, more so than my turban style towels.  </li>
            <li>The Luxe Beauty Microfiber Hair Towel looked like the perfect alternative to simply sleeping with wet hair</li>
            <li>I give only my honest opinion when review products.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The towel is extremely soft, which I love.</li>
            <li>Many years ago I bought Aquis towels, one of the early microfiber towels.</li>
            <li>I love being pleasantly surprised by a product.  </li>
            <li>machine wash in warm water without bleach or fabric softener and tumble on low or hang to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The opinions I have expressed are my own and only that of mine!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>As a prior customer, I was provided this item for review, but this is my honest opinion.  </li>
            <li>I hung it up with a smile and look forward to using it again</li>
            <li>I am so excited to use this towel in the morning when I&#x27;m rushing to get ready for work.  </li>
            <li>right this is never gonna work...  </li>
            <li>You can feel the towel absorb the water from my hair right away.</li>
            <li>hair towel is the right size and does the job just right.</li>
            <li>I love this hair towel, it is so soft and dries my hair really fast!</li>
            <li>I do not have long hair, but I do get all sweaty and this is the perfect cloth for a quick wipe down.</li>
            <li>I also really wish it was available in more colors than just white.</li>
            <li>I styled it as usual and it looked great.  </li>
            <li>Works nice with my long hair.</li>
            <li>Nice product, but my wife&#x27;s shortish hair dries too quickly so she does not use as often as other one she has.  </li>
            <li>towel does an amazing job of helping me hair dry faster.</li>
            <li>It absorbs the water easily without completely drying it out and making it brittle.</li>
            <li>They absorb quickly and gently.</li>
            <li>So, when I&#x27;m in a rush, it&#x27;s nice to have something to quickly dry my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>took the towel off and my hair, it was not dry but it was moist, at most.</li>
            <li>Very soft, not irritating like some microfiber cloths.&lt;br /&gt;Beautiful white color and pleasant to use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also really nice not to use a full towel on my hair as it cuts down on my laundry.</li>
            <li>I am speaking from the perspective of a person with short fine hair too!</li>
            <li>Very gentle on your hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was impressed by the quality of the towel when I received it and true to the other reviews it is super soft and comfortable yet fairly thin and light weight.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product to all girl&#x27;s who want a softer towel to protect their hair from any more damage.</li>
            <li>I would recommend and I will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much for providing a sample of this product for review on my blog!</li>
            <li>Very luxurious and definitely worth</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how much water this towel absorbs!</li>
            <li>If it were bigger and had more color options, it would be perfect.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Once I get all my stuff settled since we&#x27;ve moved back home following a fire last April, I plan on buying more and suggest you do the same - awesome towel!</li>
            <li>I was only able to leave it on for maybe 10-15 minutes because we had to be somewhere.  </li>
            <li>No short cuts there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair drying with a hair dryer tends to cause your hair to become more brittle.</li>
            <li>I instantly tossed that cheap dollar store hair towel in the trash!</li>
            <li>towel was sent to me for review at no cost after buying a few of their Luxe Beauty and Hydracentials products , and like those, this is good quality stuff</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a super high quality plush microfiber.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I was pleasantly surprised to find how quickly the towel absorbed the water from my hair.  </li>
            <li>My wife uses a microfiber hair towel every day and was looking for a new one to replace her old ones from many years.</li>
            <li>Upon use it is able to dry your hair very quickly and exhibits a high capacity for absorbing water.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a towel of this size, absorbency, softness, price and overall great quality, for use as I have described above, then we highly recommend this Luxe Beauty Essentials Hair Towel based on our experience with it...</li>
            <li>It is super soft and just the right size for wrapping around a head of hair.</li>
            <li>I have used a lot of different hair towels (even microfiber ones) in the past but this one is absolutely the best!</li>
            <li>This towel is super absorbent, and very soft.  </li>
            <li>then you probably don’t allow yourself very much time to get ready in the morning.</li>
            <li>While drying it is able to dry well and even after extended use over a period of days still shows consistent quality and ability to absorb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is great for wrapping your head after drying off to help absorb additional moisture so that you don&#x27;t have to blow dry it for as long.</li>
            <li>I was not required to write a positive review (and sometimes not required to at all).</li>
            <li>For years I have wanted to try these as I know others who use these exclusively because they love them so much but every single one I found was tiny and more of a cap or turban.</li>
            <li>My hair turned out the same as it would with my other towels, it looks great.  </li>
            <li>Very soft, very absorbant, dries quickly.  </li>
            <li>The material is extremely soft and plush, but dries quickly.</li>
            <li>It is super soft.</li>
            <li>Love this towel it does dry your hair faster</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s low maintenance in the field, and cleans easily too.</li>
            <li>Curly girls know the evils of this and how many hair professionals recommend using anything but a bath towel, including paper napkins, to dry your hair.</li>
            <li>Wrapping my hair in a normal towel a la turban style is cumbersome and heavy and doesn’t lead to good results anyway.</li>
            <li>Smart girl.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It certainly washed up wonderfully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>towel is another fine concept from Kristen Darkenwald - that lady who cares enough about her products to test each one herself.</li>
            <li>I like my hair to look and feel soft and healthy, so I rarely blow dry my hair.</li>
            <li>This is a very high quality hair towel.</li>
            <li>It dries your hair pretty quickly and has cut down on my air drying time significantly.</li>
            <li>(this isn&#x27;t really comfortable in the winter), or to leaving my hair wet in the morning when flying out the door on the rare occasion that I take a shower in the morning.</li>
            <li>very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It absorbs absolutely well too.</li>
            <li>I understand that this size is really meant for shorter hair.  </li>
            <li>I really like it</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for both females and males - a Unisex towel!</li>
            <li>It is very absorbent.</li>
            <li>/&gt;*I received a free product for review, but this review is totally unbiased.</li>
            <li>Unlike using a full-size towel, it&#x27;s much lighter on your head and stays in place well.</li>
            <li>If you are going to be moving around a lot, you can just use a hair clip to secure the back.</li>
            <li>and I found it works very well,  </li>
            <li>real</li>
            <li>but before blow drying my wet hair, I used this to wrap my hair to see if I could take out more moisture before blow drying my hair.</li>
            <li>I gently hand-dried my hair with it for a minute.  </li>
            <li>No one wants to spend all day trying to get ready for the start of the day.</li>
            <li>Why does this seem to take up so much time?</li>
            <li>and I can now see why everyone loves these so much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so plush and soft feeling yet lightweight unlike many towels of a similar feel which have caused headaches from the weight of the towel itself combined with the water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you want a nice size towel to dry thick or long hair, it should work great.</li>
            <li>Stains remove from this pretty easy if you catch them early enough.</li>
            <li>I have already washed this towel a couple times through the washer/dryer and it has come out exactly as new, super soft, every time.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think I would be so excited about this Luxe Towel, but I was totally!  </li>
            <li>Now with this microfiber towel by the time my skincare and makeup is done my hair is dry too leading this to being the only towel I now use on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely going to order some more as gifts!</li>
            <li>, so I showered tonight, yes it happens, and I put it on my head as I did my regular after shower routine, clean the ears, face serum, moisturizer, skin cream, hair protectant,</li>
            <li>They are very professional and have a fantastic fan base and excellent customer service</li>
            <li>Seriously, they are that nice, and when a towel can impress a 65 year old man you know it&#x27;s special.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it could dry my hair even more if I could leave it on longer, but that&#x27;s not easy when chasing after a toddler.&lt;br</li>
            <li>These helped cut down the dry time significantly without the need for damaging heat and even better, it didn&#x27;t rough up the hair&#x27;s cuticle or contribute to static frizz.</li>
            <li>First of its sooooo soft.</li>
            <li>love the way it sucks moisture out of my hair- so much better than using a regular terry cloth towel!</li>
            <li>I barely had to use the blow dryer this time around since the towel absorbed the damp fur.  </li>
            <li>Nice but still on the small side.  </li>
            <li>It has proven to be very absorbent and it is even being widely used in many baby items like diapers because it so soft.</li>
            <li>towel is pretty basic, its your normal plush microfiber material which is super soft, but also very absorbent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read many times bleaching microfiber breaks down the fibers</li>
            <li>I find it more useful for other purposes, such as a face towel and a towel to take along to the gym.</li>
            <li>The towel dries quickly so by the next morning</li>
            <li>I definitely need to get some more for Xmas gifts since I have a ton of female family members!</li>
            <li>This hair towel is a simple design in a luxuriously soft and comfortable fabric that wicks water away.</li>
            <li>Make sure you don&#x27;t use fabric softener beause that will mess up the absorbency.  </li>
            <li>This towel is so very soft!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>This made it much faster to dry itself when simply hanging it over the top of the shower.</li>
            <li>I was super excited about receiving the Luxe Beauty Essential Microfiber Hair Towel because it is specifically made to dry your hair!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It works well, but I’d still like a little more width.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is so soft and gentle on your hair and absorbency reduces the drying time.  </li>
            <li>The towel absorbs the water from my hair and I am able to simply brush out and blow dry.  </li>
            <li>This is a great little investment, especially for ladies with long hair.</li>
            <li>The small business owner of this company is very passionate about her products and goes to the extreme To provide the best quality.</li>
            <li>I have used many hair towels over the years, but this one definitely helps dry my hair the fastest!</li>
            <li>Rather than be paper thin, this is rather  plush and cushy (as far as microfiber goes – it’s no where near as thick as a good conventional cotton towel).</li>
            <li>i have that new towel i was sent to try out and review</li>
            <li>Pas advertised, this towel is very soft and has done well with my hair.</li>
            <li>This towel is thicker than I imagined and very soft.</li>
            <li>This will not be the last of these hair towels that we get; as noted, it is time for me to go purchase one too, since my daughter has absconded with this first one.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>, the towel was soooooo soft i couldnt believe it!</li>
            <li>My daughter has beautiful, very long, thick blonde hair.</li>
            <li>Most other towels are not as soft and definitely not as absorbent.  </li>
            <li>I put my long hair in a bun and go right to bed.</li>
            <li>a side note: I was provided a free version of this product as a previous customer of this vendor&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li>Because it absorbed the moisture so quickly, I didn&#x27;t need to rub the towel rapidly through my hair therefore making my hair&#x27;s final resut smoother with less fly-away strands.  </li>
            <li>I also wrapped my hair in it before going to bed and by morning it was completely dry, which is rare for me.</li>
            <li>Fur dried very quickly.  </li>
            <li>The 19 by 39 size is a nice balance between big enough to be highly useful but still small enough to stow easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You really have to be careful using too much heat on your hair.  </li>
            <li>Immediately out of packaging you can feel how soft and luxurious it feels.</li>
            <li>Soft and it works.</li>
            <li>Like really soft.</li>
            <li>This one was just so soft there was none of that.</li>
            <li>Do not think that I have ever felt a towel as soft as this towel from Luxe Beauty Essentials.</li>
            <li>Because it is so incredibly soft, I can use it on my face and around my eyes without any scratching of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also been using it for my baby--he just loves to snuggle with that soft towel.</li>
            <li>Well after using for a week, she insisted I buy another because she threw out all of her old towels and replaced with these.</li>
            <li>am a professional blogger that got this product as a review item.</li>
            <li>Generous size, soft, absorbent and plush.</li>
            <li>Actually works very well.  </li>
            <li>This microfiber towel is almost unbelievably soft and plush on both sides.  </li>
            <li>Soft, absorbent luxury hair towel.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised by how soft it was.</li>
            <li>This super soft towel just seems to suck up the water from your hair without a whole lot of effort on your part, making it a gentle and less damaging way to dry hair.</li>
            <li>As soon as I got the Luxe Beauty Essentials Plush Microfiber Hair Towel in the mail I ran and grabbed my old one to compare, so my hair was dry when I first tried them both side by side, or head by head, or whatever ...</li>
            <li>This very finely made plush microfiber towel may be designed for the ladies with long hair who care about how long it takes to dry those beautiful tresses with an emphasis on hair protection, but for men this towel is equally effective - especially as we age and the amount of hair loss each day is exacerbated by rough, tough towel drying of the hair (or worse yet, speeding up the process with a hair</li>
            <li>First of all, I have to say that I have very long</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s completely dry and ready to use again!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed less breakage using this towel as it is tons more softer and is made to not damage your hair as you dry it.</li>
            <li>Having used the same towel to dry my hair for years, I was quick to agree to review the hair towel.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s jusssst big enough to put up in a turban, and tuck about 1/2 inch at the nape of my neck, but even then it tends to fall down most of the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just wrap it around my hair on top of my head for about 5-10 minutes, and my hair is dry enough that there isn&#x27;t any dripping or wet spots on my shirt.</li>
            <li>In short, it&#x27;s a decent towel</li>
            <li>so I have to fold my hair into it because it isn’t wide enough to cover the full length of my hair.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a solid, quality hair towel.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.ider buying an extra if you have kids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this hair towel to everyone, especially those who require a lot of time drying their hair.</li>
            <li>but I liked that it wasn&#x27;t heavy and bulky like typical towels.  </li>
            <li>I have long hair and the microfiber is very absorbent.  </li>
            <li>I will never go back to a normal towel for my hair.  </li>
            <li>Finally a microfiber towel large enough to work as a turban.</li>
            <li>The towel was quite wet and my hair was a little more than damp.  </li>
            <li>I used this towel to dry my very hairy Lhasa Apso dog.  </li>
            <li>My hair is almost dry by the time I am ready to style it.  </li>
            <li>The microfiber fabric absorbs so much of the water that your hair is almost dry when you unwrap it.</li>
            <li>My hair is pretty long and the ends peak through because it&#x27;s too short.</li>
            <li>Zero loose threads, and a well-stitched hem all-around.</li>
            <li>We line dry, which normally leaves all of our towels like sand paper...but not this!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve actually considered getting another one for drying my son off after his baths since he is sensitive to some textures and won&#x27;t let me dry him for very long.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They do the job, sort of, I mean they are better than trying to balance a giant bath towel on your head, but they really do not absorb much.</li>
            <li>I almost always let my hair air dry after wrapping it up in a towel for a while and really only blow dry for special occasions.  </li>
            <li>I have long hair and this towel is just large enough, but I just wish it was a tad bit</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good that it&#x27;s not big because it takes up very little room, but I also like my towels a little bigger.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t clear to me what the difference could possibly be with a towel</li>
            <li>No more dripping wet hair after the shower and it is supposedly better for your hair than regualr towels.</li>
            <li>The Luxe Beauty Essential Plush Microsoft Hair towel is extremely soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so soft and is double sided and absorbs the water</li>
            <li>so, when I say I love a towel, this is some serious business!</li>
            <li>I never have time to wait for my hair to dry in a normal towel</li>
            <li>I have pretty long hair and this towel is just long enough to get it all when I wrap it up.</li>
            <li>I have other microfiber absorbing hair towels, so I thought this would be just like the others.  </li>
            <li>Super absorbent, drys hair in about half an hour, then I blow dry for 90 seconds to perfection.  </li>
            <li>she actually uses it to dry his whole body, its very soft and does not seem to get wet before she is done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As much as I try, I can never get it dry enough with a normal towel to not have the water eventually drain to the ends of my hair and inevitably leave me with a wet shirt.</li>
            <li>not only dry, still firmly attached to my head, even though there is no button and elastic loop to put the button through, and most of all DRY!</li>
            <li>Another plus is their size, fit well with other swimming essentials in little boys backpacks.</li>
            <li>I usually use a huge bath sheet to dry my hair.  </li>
            <li>I also have fine thin hair so if you have thicker lush hair, this towel might not be big enough.</li>
            <li>Really cuts down on hair drying time.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used hair towels before so wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect, but I it cut down the time to blow dry my hair by half somehow!</li>
            <li>so I use a towel to dry off completely.  </li>
            <li>Normal towels just aren&#x27;t absorbent enough, so I end up walking around with my hair dripping everywhere, resulting in wet spots on my shirt</li>
            <li>(this is about the time I would normally have to take my dollar store towel off as it would be soaked, and my hair would still be wet), what did I do next ...</li>
            <li>I think I have shoulder length hair of medium thickness - not especially long at all - and I bought this towel a few months based on the positive reveiws.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Based on the information provided by the seller, one of the main components that sets this apart from other towels is its double sided brushed terry composition.  </li>
            <li>I have long and thick hair and have been searching for a special towel to use exclusively after showers.  </li>

            <li> Amazing!</li>
            <li> It worked amazingly well!</li>
            <li> Excellent quality, I just wish they would sell a package with 2 or 3  at a better price.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I have been loving this towel since I got it in the mail!</li>
            <li> Effective and a treat at once!</li>
            <li> I thought I liked those towels - NOT!</li>
            <li> It is a good size and is very effective.</li>
            <li> I was offered a sample of this product to test and review honestly, and I honestly think it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> If I used a cotton towel, it didn&#x27;t absorb as good as this microfiber towel did.</li>
            <li> Its quality is so good that even after 10 washes,it has regained its color and texture.</li>
            <li> Super impressed with this.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, a very good product that I really enjoy using.</li>
            <li> Ok so all my girl friends always talk about how great microfiber towels are for drying your hair.</li>
            <li> Lovely!</li>
            <li> I love this towel!  </li>
            <li> I would buy more!</li>
            <li> I am in love with this towel!</li>

            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> Everything I wanted and more!</li>
            <li> It was like the towel magically sucked the water from my hair!</li>
            <li> This towel is kind of amazing.</li>
            <li> I was given the chance to try out this towel for free, how great is that?</li>
            <li> In the washer and dryer, it came out without any damage (for me) and still retained its amazing, plush quality.</li>
            <li> This towel is AMAZING.</li>
            <li> This towel is amazing.</li>
            <li> Not as absorbent as I would&#x27;ve liked.</li>
            <li> I also like to use this towel when I am doing my own at home spa treatment.</li>
            <li> I agree that a t-shirt works just as well as this towel, but it&#x27;s nice to a have a dedicated towel.</li>
            <li> This is a nice size towel and being microfiber</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall this towel is so nice that I am considering purchasing additional ones to give as holiday gifts.</li>
            <li> All opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I was given one of these hair towels to try out and offer my honest opinion.  </li>
            <li> I received this product in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;(I was provided a sample for review purposes; my opinions are my own based on my experience with this product.)</li>
            <li> /&gt;The incredible absorbency and the generous size make it an excellent choice for wrapping wet hair or even for drying baby at bathtime.  </li>
            <li> I put it on after getting out of the shower, stays on nicely.</li>
            <li> wash warm, tumble dry&lt;</li>
            <li> and  I must say a very wonderful company to deal with by far!!!</li>
            <li> That is okay though, it still sits very comfortably on my head!</li>
            <li> Washing this is very easy.</li>
            <li> On the contrary, this is one of the most effective drying cloths or towels I have ever used.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , it is so soft and feels wonderful on my head.  </li>
            <li> And Kristen offers great customer service as always!</li>
            <li> She is very happy with the towel, she is no longer using the dryer, with our 2 year old</li>
            <li> The soft ends are perfect for wiping sweat off your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Well, maybe, because I love, love, love this one!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very light weight</li>
            <li> It feels wonderful – very soft and scratch free.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was able to receive this product for testing for being a precious member of the company.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> love this towel.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so glad that I chose to give it a try and a review.</li>
            <li> but this is proof that there are more absorbent materials that can be utilized.</li>
            <li> Hopefully see more colors</li>
            <li> This product was provided to me free for the purpose of inspection and my honest unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> but it sure did.</li>
            <li> Love it or your money back.\\&quot;...</li>
            <li> well, we already love it so no issue here.</li>
            <li> However, if something wacky happens to change that opinion, I will return here to update the review and let you know what the issue was and how resolution was handled.</li>
            <li> Love the size and everything about this towel.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m sure I don&#x27;t accidentally toss in it with a load that I added fabric softener to.</li>

            <li> Plus it makes for just a smidgen more room in the washer on towel day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It felt more like a spa treatment than anything; I would envision myself using a towel this plush at a salon or any sort of spa.</li>
            <li> way more than what it costs.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This has to be better for my hair.  </li>
            <li> , I am once again completely satisfied and confident to share my feedback.</li>
            <li> Then I would have to spend more time working out the snarles.  </li>
            <li> As soon as I took the towel out of the plastic wrap, I fell in love with the softness.  </li>
            <li> The world of microfiber is so much better now.</li>

            <li> I LOVE this plush towel!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> After purchasing their great Hydracentials bottle, I jumped at a chance to try other products.&lt;br /&gt;The towel feels great</li>
            <li> Moreover, this is perfect for the beach (especially after you&#x27;ve hosed the same off yourself), and is also ideal on camping trips.</li>
            <li> I loved it so much I bought another for my sister and my nieces!</li>

            <li> /&gt;*Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
            <li> It is so comfortable and easy to use, and kept my hair piled on top of my head all throughout the night.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall it is a very good hair towel and is of really high quality; all for a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Very nice quality by far</li>
            <li> It is easy to wash, and holds up to quite a bit of abuse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The shape and weight makes it so easy to wrap up your hair, turban style.</li>
            <li> Care is easy:  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lightweight, easy to use, and makes me feel like I&#x27;m at a spa when I get out of the shower.</li>
            <li> I can wrap around my head easily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nothing special but it&#x27;s better than using my husband&#x27;s ripped up t-shirts.</li>
            <li> It is soooo soft and nice!</li>
            <li> The size and shape works perfectly for any hair length (I don&#x27;t have a lot of hair on top, but some on the sides - it works for me; my wife has lovely shoulder length thick hair</li>
            <li> So with a great sense of relief I am able to throw away the old and replace it with an even better new!!</li>
            <li> It is easy to fit into a gym bag and it air-drys very quickly.</li>
            <li> By contrast this is huge and easily covered all of my hair.</li>
            <li> Although I was provided this for free to test, I would have easily bought this.</li>
            <li> Because it is microfiber, it dries incredibly quickly!</li>
            <li> According to her, these things are amazingly absorbent, perfectly sized to wrap around your wet head, and are very soft and durable.</li>
            <li> As a customer of other products from this company,i am so glad to get this product to be able to use it and get the true joy of having my child and me cherish parenting.</li>
            <li> We did receive this great towel gratis from the seller and have put it through the paces to objectively find out how well it performed.</li>
            <li> again, here is a thoughtful product that is made with the consumer&#x27;s well being in mind.</li>
            <li> It does all that it claims, and I enjoy using it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I honestly didn&#x27;t think I would be blown away by a towel, but I really was.</li>
            <li> received this free for review purposes.</li>
            <li> It would be perfect if it was just a few inches longer for my needs.  </li>
            <li> monitory compensation was received ( i was given the product free to review with no intention on compensation).</li>
            <li> got this free for review</li>
            <li> Instructions for claiming a free microfiber face cloth are provided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is soft and nice to use, on top of doing its job</li>
            <li> Really, how many more uses can I find for this towel.</li>
            <li> I managed to make it work, and it&#x27;s easier to use than a full size towel, but not as easy as I wanted.</li>
            <li> nicely done, and I would highly recommend this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I often end up returning to my original towels in frustration.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to try this hair towel.  </li>
            <li> so you could bleach it clean.  </li>
            <li> It’s also hugely absorbent, soaking up water quickly and holding it</li>
            <li> Replacing all my towels to this type because they are great to dry off with.  </li>
            <li> Works amazing for drying natural hair before air drying.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ridiculously soft and the perfect size for my long hair.</li>
            <li> It’s a bright white color.</li>
            <li> It works great to finish drying my hair and also as a wrap for my wet</li>
            <li> my opinion, it is because it is more gently on the hair.  </li>
            <li> The hype is true.  </li>
            <li> I have fine hair and don&#x27;t like to use the blow dryer very much because of heat damage.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s quick drying qualities, it dries out in practically no time when hung across a shower rod.</li>
            <li> It dries your hair quickly.</li>
            <li> The towel air dries quickly.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this material and would LOVE a larger version to use as a gym towel!</li>
            <li> It dries my hair quite well and dries itself out quickly.</li>
            <li> The towel itself also dries fairly quickly, too, when you&#x27;re done with</li>
            <li> Super absorbent.</li>
            <li> It dries my hair quickly and allows me to brush and comb before I head out the door, even when I&#x27;m in a hurry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> did receive this product for free but the experience and opinions are my own and my only compensation was this product.</li>
            <li> It is just the right size, does an amazing job of drying my hair even faster than my old towel, and my hair does not seem as frizzy.</li>
            <li> Wash as normal, but be sure NOT to use fabric softener with this.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stress how much better this towel is than any normal bath towel..</li>
            <li> The towel was not soaked after my shower like a normal bath towel, even though it had removed most of the water and moisture from my hair.</li>
            <li> urge you to wash and dry this towel before using to allow it to work with optimum results.</li>
            <li> size means it will be easy to pack and take on my trips -- instead of relying on hotel towels, I&#x27;ll have something that works much</li>
            <li> so I could better wrap my hair and still have enough room to tuck in the end easily.  </li>
            <li> My hair is super soft and tangle free!.  </li>
            <li> I love the super soft fabric this is made of.</li>
            <li> The Luxe Beauty Microfiber Hair Towel did an excellent job of leaving my hair much more dry by morning, and even less unruly!</li>
            <li> I really love this soft hair towel.</li>
            <li> This towel feels so nice on the skin and dries me off completely unlike most regular towels.  </li>
            <li> soft and absorbent, more so than my turban style towels.  </li>
            <li> The Luxe Beauty Microfiber Hair Towel looked like the perfect alternative to simply sleeping with wet hair</li>
            <li> I give only my honest opinion when review products.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The towel is extremely soft, which I love.</li>
            <li> Many years ago I bought Aquis towels, one of the early microfiber towels.</li>
            <li> I love being pleasantly surprised by a product.  </li>
            <li> machine wash in warm water without bleach or fabric softener and tumble on low or hang to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The opinions I have expressed are my own and only that of mine!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> As a prior customer, I was provided this item for review, but this is my honest opinion.  </li>
            <li> I hung it up with a smile and look forward to using it again</li>
            <li> I am so excited to use this towel in the morning when I&#x27;m rushing to get ready for work.  </li>
            <li> right this is never gonna work...  </li>
            <li> You can feel the towel absorb the water from my hair right away.</li>
            <li> hair towel is the right size and does the job just right.</li>
            <li> I love this hair towel, it is so soft and dries my hair really fast!</li>
            <li> I do not have long hair, but I do get all sweaty and this is the perfect cloth for a quick wipe down.</li>
            <li> I also really wish it was available in more colors than just white.</li>
            <li> I styled it as usual and it looked great.  </li>
            <li> Works nice with my long hair.</li>
            <li> Nice product, but my wife&#x27;s shortish hair dries too quickly so she does not use as often as other one she has.  </li>
            <li> towel does an amazing job of helping me hair dry faster.</li>
            <li> It absorbs the water easily without completely drying it out and making it brittle.</li>
            <li> They absorb quickly and gently.</li>
            <li> So, when I&#x27;m in a rush, it&#x27;s nice to have something to quickly dry my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> took the towel off and my hair, it was not dry but it was moist, at most.</li>
            <li> Very soft, not irritating like some microfiber cloths.&lt;br /&gt;Beautiful white color and pleasant to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also really nice not to use a full towel on my hair as it cuts down on my laundry.</li>
            <li> I am speaking from the perspective of a person with short fine hair too!</li>
            <li> Very gentle on your hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was impressed by the quality of the towel when I received it and true to the other reviews it is super soft and comfortable yet fairly thin and light weight.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product to all girl&#x27;s who want a softer towel to protect their hair from any more damage.</li>
            <li> I would recommend and I will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much for providing a sample of this product for review on my blog!</li>
            <li> Very luxurious and definitely worth</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how much water this towel absorbs!</li>
            <li> If it were bigger and had more color options, it would be perfect.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Once I get all my stuff settled since we&#x27;ve moved back home following a fire last April, I plan on buying more and suggest you do the same - awesome towel!</li>
            <li> I was only able to leave it on for maybe 10-15 minutes because we had to be somewhere.  </li>
            <li> No short cuts there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair drying with a hair dryer tends to cause your hair to become more brittle.</li>
            <li> I instantly tossed that cheap dollar store hair towel in the trash!</li>
            <li> towel was sent to me for review at no cost after buying a few of their Luxe Beauty and Hydracentials products , and like those, this is good quality stuff</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a super high quality plush microfiber.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I was pleasantly surprised to find how quickly the towel absorbed the water from my hair.  </li>
            <li> My wife uses a microfiber hair towel every day and was looking for a new one to replace her old ones from many years.</li>
            <li> Upon use it is able to dry your hair very quickly and exhibits a high capacity for absorbing water.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a towel of this size, absorbency, softness, price and overall great quality, for use as I have described above, then we highly recommend this Luxe Beauty Essentials Hair Towel based on our experience with it...</li>
            <li> It is super soft and just the right size for wrapping around a head of hair.</li>
            <li> I have used a lot of different hair towels (even microfiber ones) in the past but this one is absolutely the best!</li>
            <li> This towel is super absorbent, and very soft.  </li>
            <li> then you probably don’t allow yourself very much time to get ready in the morning.</li>
            <li> While drying it is able to dry well and even after extended use over a period of days still shows consistent quality and ability to absorb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is great for wrapping your head after drying off to help absorb additional moisture so that you don&#x27;t have to blow dry it for as long.</li>
            <li> I was not required to write a positive review (and sometimes not required to at all).</li>
            <li> For years I have wanted to try these as I know others who use these exclusively because they love them so much but every single one I found was tiny and more of a cap or turban.</li>
            <li> My hair turned out the same as it would with my other towels, it looks great.  </li>
            <li> Very soft, very absorbant, dries quickly.  </li>
            <li> The material is extremely soft and plush, but dries quickly.</li>
            <li> It is super soft.</li>
            <li> Love this towel it does dry your hair faster</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s low maintenance in the field, and cleans easily too.</li>
            <li> Curly girls know the evils of this and how many hair professionals recommend using anything but a bath towel, including paper napkins, to dry your hair.</li>
            <li> Wrapping my hair in a normal towel a la turban style is cumbersome and heavy and doesn’t lead to good results anyway.</li>
            <li> Smart girl.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It certainly washed up wonderfully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> towel is another fine concept from Kristen Darkenwald - that lady who cares enough about her products to test each one herself.</li>
            <li> I like my hair to look and feel soft and healthy, so I rarely blow dry my hair.</li>
            <li> This is a very high quality hair towel.</li>
            <li> It dries your hair pretty quickly and has cut down on my air drying time significantly.</li>
            <li> (this isn&#x27;t really comfortable in the winter), or to leaving my hair wet in the morning when flying out the door on the rare occasion that I take a shower in the morning.</li>
            <li> very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It absorbs absolutely well too.</li>
            <li> I understand that this size is really meant for shorter hair.  </li>
            <li> I really like it</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for both females and males - a Unisex towel!</li>
            <li> It is very absorbent.</li>
            <li> /&gt;*I received a free product for review, but this review is totally unbiased.</li>
            <li> Unlike using a full-size towel, it&#x27;s much lighter on your head and stays in place well.</li>
            <li> If you are going to be moving around a lot, you can just use a hair clip to secure the back.</li>
            <li> and I found it works very well,  </li>
            <li> real</li>
            <li> but before blow drying my wet hair, I used this to wrap my hair to see if I could take out more moisture before blow drying my hair.</li>
            <li> I gently hand-dried my hair with it for a minute.  </li>
            <li> No one wants to spend all day trying to get ready for the start of the day.</li>
            <li> Why does this seem to take up so much time?</li>
            <li> and I can now see why everyone loves these so much.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so plush and soft feeling yet lightweight unlike many towels of a similar feel which have caused headaches from the weight of the towel itself combined with the water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you want a nice size towel to dry thick or long hair, it should work great.</li>
            <li> Stains remove from this pretty easy if you catch them early enough.</li>
            <li> I have already washed this towel a couple times through the washer/dryer and it has come out exactly as new, super soft, every time.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think I would be so excited about this Luxe Towel, but I was totally!  </li>
            <li> Now with this microfiber towel by the time my skincare and makeup is done my hair is dry too leading this to being the only towel I now use on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely going to order some more as gifts!</li>
            <li> , so I showered tonight, yes it happens, and I put it on my head as I did my regular after shower routine, clean the ears, face serum, moisturizer, skin cream, hair protectant,</li>
            <li> They are very professional and have a fantastic fan base and excellent customer service</li>
            <li> Seriously, they are that nice, and when a towel can impress a 65 year old man you know it&#x27;s special.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it could dry my hair even more if I could leave it on longer, but that&#x27;s not easy when chasing after a toddler.&lt;br</li>
            <li> These helped cut down the dry time significantly without the need for damaging heat and even better, it didn&#x27;t rough up the hair&#x27;s cuticle or contribute to static frizz.</li>
            <li> First of its sooooo soft.</li>
            <li> love the way it sucks moisture out of my hair- so much better than using a regular terry cloth towel!</li>
            <li> I barely had to use the blow dryer this time around since the towel absorbed the damp fur.  </li>
            <li> Nice but still on the small side.  </li>
            <li> It has proven to be very absorbent and it is even being widely used in many baby items like diapers because it so soft.</li>
            <li> towel is pretty basic, its your normal plush microfiber material which is super soft, but also very absorbent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read many times bleaching microfiber breaks down the fibers</li>
            <li> I find it more useful for other purposes, such as a face towel and a towel to take along to the gym.</li>
            <li> The towel dries quickly so by the next morning</li>
            <li> I definitely need to get some more for Xmas gifts since I have a ton of female family members!</li>
            <li> This hair towel is a simple design in a luxuriously soft and comfortable fabric that wicks water away.</li>
            <li> Make sure you don&#x27;t use fabric softener beause that will mess up the absorbency.  </li>
            <li> This towel is so very soft!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This made it much faster to dry itself when simply hanging it over the top of the shower.</li>
            <li> I was super excited about receiving the Luxe Beauty Essential Microfiber Hair Towel because it is specifically made to dry your hair!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It works well, but I’d still like a little more width.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is so soft and gentle on your hair and absorbency reduces the drying time.  </li>
            <li> The towel absorbs the water from my hair and I am able to simply brush out and blow dry.  </li>
            <li> This is a great little investment, especially for ladies with long hair.</li>
            <li> The small business owner of this company is very passionate about her products and goes to the extreme To provide the best quality.</li>
            <li> I have used many hair towels over the years, but this one definitely helps dry my hair the fastest!</li>
            <li> Rather than be paper thin, this is rather  plush and cushy (as far as microfiber goes – it’s no where near as thick as a good conventional cotton towel).</li>
            <li> i have that new towel i was sent to try out and review</li>
            <li> Pas advertised, this towel is very soft and has done well with my hair.</li>
            <li> This towel is thicker than I imagined and very soft.</li>
            <li> This will not be the last of these hair towels that we get; as noted, it is time for me to go purchase one too, since my daughter has absconded with this first one.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> , the towel was soooooo soft i couldnt believe it!</li>
            <li> My daughter has beautiful, very long, thick blonde hair.</li>
            <li> Most other towels are not as soft and definitely not as absorbent.  </li>
            <li> I put my long hair in a bun and go right to bed.</li>
            <li> a side note: I was provided a free version of this product as a previous customer of this vendor&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li> Because it absorbed the moisture so quickly, I didn&#x27;t need to rub the towel rapidly through my hair therefore making my hair&#x27;s final resut smoother with less fly-away strands.  </li>
            <li> I also wrapped my hair in it before going to bed and by morning it was completely dry, which is rare for me.</li>
            <li> Fur dried very quickly.  </li>
            <li> The 19 by 39 size is a nice balance between big enough to be highly useful but still small enough to stow easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You really have to be careful using too much heat on your hair.  </li>
            <li> Immediately out of packaging you can feel how soft and luxurious it feels.</li>
            <li> Soft and it works.</li>
            <li> Like really soft.</li>
            <li> This one was just so soft there was none of that.</li>
            <li> Do not think that I have ever felt a towel as soft as this towel from Luxe Beauty Essentials.</li>
            <li> Because it is so incredibly soft, I can use it on my face and around my eyes without any scratching of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also been using it for my baby--he just loves to snuggle with that soft towel.</li>
            <li> Well after using for a week, she insisted I buy another because she threw out all of her old towels and replaced with these.</li>
            <li> am a professional blogger that got this product as a review item.</li>
            <li> Generous size, soft, absorbent and plush.</li>
            <li> Actually works very well.  </li>
            <li> This microfiber towel is almost unbelievably soft and plush on both sides.  </li>
            <li> Soft, absorbent luxury hair towel.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised by how soft it was.</li>
            <li> This super soft towel just seems to suck up the water from your hair without a whole lot of effort on your part, making it a gentle and less damaging way to dry hair.</li>
            <li> As soon as I got the Luxe Beauty Essentials Plush Microfiber Hair Towel in the mail I ran and grabbed my old one to compare, so my hair was dry when I first tried them both side by side, or head by head, or whatever ...</li>
            <li> This very finely made plush microfiber towel may be designed for the ladies with long hair who care about how long it takes to dry those beautiful tresses with an emphasis on hair protection, but for men this towel is equally effective - especially as we age and the amount of hair loss each day is exacerbated by rough, tough towel drying of the hair (or worse yet, speeding up the process with a hair</li>
            <li> First of all, I have to say that I have very long</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s completely dry and ready to use again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed less breakage using this towel as it is tons more softer and is made to not damage your hair as you dry it.</li>
            <li> Having used the same towel to dry my hair for years, I was quick to agree to review the hair towel.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s jusssst big enough to put up in a turban, and tuck about 1/2 inch at the nape of my neck, but even then it tends to fall down most of the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just wrap it around my hair on top of my head for about 5-10 minutes, and my hair is dry enough that there isn&#x27;t any dripping or wet spots on my shirt.</li>
            <li> In short, it&#x27;s a decent towel</li>
            <li> so I have to fold my hair into it because it isn’t wide enough to cover the full length of my hair.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a solid, quality hair towel.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.ider buying an extra if you have kids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this hair towel to everyone, especially those who require a lot of time drying their hair.</li>
            <li> but I liked that it wasn&#x27;t heavy and bulky like typical towels.  </li>
            <li> I have long hair and the microfiber is very absorbent.  </li>
            <li> I will never go back to a normal towel for my hair.  </li>
            <li> Finally a microfiber towel large enough to work as a turban.</li>
            <li> The towel was quite wet and my hair was a little more than damp.  </li>
            <li> I used this towel to dry my very hairy Lhasa Apso dog.  </li>
            <li> My hair is almost dry by the time I am ready to style it.  </li>
            <li> The microfiber fabric absorbs so much of the water that your hair is almost dry when you unwrap it.</li>
            <li> My hair is pretty long and the ends peak through because it&#x27;s too short.</li>
            <li> Zero loose threads, and a well-stitched hem all-around.</li>
            <li> We line dry, which normally leaves all of our towels like sand paper...but not this!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve actually considered getting another one for drying my son off after his baths since he is sensitive to some textures and won&#x27;t let me dry him for very long.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They do the job, sort of, I mean they are better than trying to balance a giant bath towel on your head, but they really do not absorb much.</li>
            <li> I almost always let my hair air dry after wrapping it up in a towel for a while and really only blow dry for special occasions.  </li>
            <li> I have long hair and this towel is just large enough, but I just wish it was a tad bit</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good that it&#x27;s not big because it takes up very little room, but I also like my towels a little bigger.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t clear to me what the difference could possibly be with a towel</li>
            <li> No more dripping wet hair after the shower and it is supposedly better for your hair than regualr towels.</li>
            <li> The Luxe Beauty Essential Plush Microsoft Hair towel is extremely soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so soft and is double sided and absorbs the water</li>
            <li> so, when I say I love a towel, this is some serious business!</li>
            <li> I never have time to wait for my hair to dry in a normal towel</li>
            <li> I have pretty long hair and this towel is just long enough to get it all when I wrap it up.</li>
            <li> I have other microfiber absorbing hair towels, so I thought this would be just like the others.  </li>
            <li> Super absorbent, drys hair in about half an hour, then I blow dry for 90 seconds to perfection.  </li>
            <li> she actually uses it to dry his whole body, its very soft and does not seem to get wet before she is done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As much as I try, I can never get it dry enough with a normal towel to not have the water eventually drain to the ends of my hair and inevitably leave me with a wet shirt.</li>
            <li> not only dry, still firmly attached to my head, even though there is no button and elastic loop to put the button through, and most of all DRY!</li>
            <li> Another plus is their size, fit well with other swimming essentials in little boys backpacks.</li>
            <li> I usually use a huge bath sheet to dry my hair.  </li>
            <li> I also have fine thin hair so if you have thicker lush hair, this towel might not be big enough.</li>
            <li> Really cuts down on hair drying time.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used hair towels before so wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect, but I it cut down the time to blow dry my hair by half somehow!</li>
            <li> so I use a towel to dry off completely.  </li>
            <li> Normal towels just aren&#x27;t absorbent enough, so I end up walking around with my hair dripping everywhere, resulting in wet spots on my shirt</li>
            <li> (this is about the time I would normally have to take my dollar store towel off as it would be soaked, and my hair would still be wet), what did I do next ...</li>
            <li> I think I have shoulder length hair of medium thickness - not especially long at all - and I bought this towel a few months based on the positive reveiws.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Based on the information provided by the seller, one of the main components that sets this apart from other towels is its double sided brushed terry composition.  </li>
            <li> I have long and thick hair and have been searching for a special towel to use exclusively after showers.  </li>
            <li> It is extremely absorbent as after wrapping my hair up in this vs. my usual bath towel, it takes notably less time for my hair to dry on its own.  </li>
            <li> But no other towel seemed to dry my hair as well.</li>
            <li> This is a huge plus for me as other towels have actually caused neck strain when balled up on my head combined with heavy wet hair.  </li>
            <li> have long but thin hair and it falls out easily.</li>
            <li> At 19 x 39 inches, this towel is just the right size for our daughter to wrap around her medium-long, fairly thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair is not long, but I imagine that for long hair this towel would be such a time saver.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> I seriously am considering purchasing a few of these for the lovely ladies in my family.</li>
            <li> In the past it took her 45 minutes to dry her hair (first she used a bath towel, then hair dryer).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It will work for long or short.  </li>
            <li> but it certainly isn&#x27;t long enough to hold my hair in place for any measurable time.</li>
            <li> and I think this product may not have been long enough to wrap all my hair.</li>
            <li> Less time with a hot dryer and less damage likely.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually use a regular towel that is dried from the sun, which is kind of hard.  </li>
            <li> The towel, itself, became dry much faster than an ordinary towel.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I am giving it 4 vs. 5 stars is because of my long thick hair, it is just a bit too small to stay securely wrapped.  </li>
            <li> Drying her hair with the Luxe Beauty Essentials microfiber hair towel then using a hair dryer has cut her drying time down considerably (it takes about 35 minutes to dry).</li>
            <li> When I remove the towel, my hair is dry enough to no longer leave the back of my shirt or my furniture wet.</li>
            <li> I have very dry curly Afro American hair</li>
            <li> Dries fast, and hardly any lint.</li>
            <li> and it really helps dry my hair a lot faster and cuts my drying time to almost half which means less damage to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was not harsh on my hair like the sun dried towel.  </li>
            <li> I have long hair and it bundled it up just right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have long hair at all</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have long hair</li>
            <li> I plan to get one for my daughter and her long hair</li>
            <li> I am not a fan of regular towels since they are a bit rough.</li>
            <li> Plus the towel is so soft and fluffy.  </li>
            <li> While it’s smaller than a bath towel, it’s larger than the typical hand towel.</li>
            <li> and I would recommend it to anyone who doesn&#x27;t like waiting too long after the shower for their hair to dry.</li>
            <li> This towel is so absorbent it didn&#x27;t take me long to dry my hair.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars was because I wish it was just a little bigger....</li>
            <li> I understand it is still much larger than the  other  towel sold for hair by Devacurl.</li>
            <li> My only wish is that this towel had the twist function and loop on it that some other hair towels have in order to keep it in place...</li>
            <li> My hair is dry enough to sleep without my pillow getting wet!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Tumble dry on medium&lt;</li>
            <li> Plus my dry time is faster while using this towel as well since it is so absorbent.</li>
            <li> This gets my hair so dry.</li>
            <li> They machine wash and dry without wear.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I need something to help dry my hair after a shower.  </li>
            <li> Immediately I noticed my hair was already really dry.  </li>
            <li> When I get out of the shower, I dry off and try to wrap my head with my bath towel</li>
            <li> I have never been one to blow dry my hair.</li>
            <li> When I used this towel I felt that after 20 minutes of wearing the towel my hair was nearly dry.</li>
            <li> I towel then air dry.</li>
            <li> It takes her forever to  dry it.</li>
            <li> It is really as soft as it looks in the pictures; I didn&#x27;t even know what I was missing!</li>
            <li> in less than 5 minutes my hair that is down to the middle of my back was completely dry!</li>
            <li> I never blow dry my hair because I will end up looking like a poodle!</li>
            <li> The dryer your hair is prior to blow drying, the less damage it would be for your hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It weighs about 185g dry, 890g soaking wet but not dripping, and 525g when the water is squeezed</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t have to be so rough on your hair trying to dry it off with a towel.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> If you happen to have long hair then you know that when you unwrap that wet towel your hair may still be wet.</li>
            <li> It quickly takes my medium length hair from soaking wet to damp, without any uncomfortable drips down my neck and back.</li>
            <li> BUT because, again, my hair is long and thick, its thin and light design doesn&#x27;t add weight to my neck when I&#x27;m walking around with it on.  </li>
            <li> and I can dry my hair with this towel with only a few swipes through my hair.</li>
            <li> I don’t towel dry my hair because regular towels are too heavy to keep on my head.</li>
            <li> It is hard to resist using on the body because it is so soft and it works well as a face towel, too.  </li>
            <li> how extremely soft it is that I could probably use it as a towrl for my baby girl&#x27;s delicate skin.</li>
            <li> Did not really expect it to be as plush and absorbent as it is, and have been amazed.</li>
            <li> My pillow is always wet</li>
            <li> It doesn’t even feel wet after using it.</li>
            <li> When I have it all up, only a few strands might peek through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> $20 for a  a towel not much longer than a hand towel...  </li>
            <li> So I end up with a wet head for quite awhile.</li>
            <li> With an average bath towel it would take another hour to be that dry.  </li>
            <li> I had heard of them and was curious if it would help dry my hair faster with less damage to it.  </li>
            <li> I noticed that when I dried my hair with this towel the next few times, it definitely made a difference in that my split ends looked less frizzy.  </li>
            <li> My hair is usually still dripping wet after using a regular towel.</li>
            <li> so it takes forever to blow dry it and half the time</li>
            <li> My two sons usually take a bath before going to bed, and the wet hair is always a problem, my wife used a hair dryer, its obviously too noisy and she worries about how it affects their hair.</li>
            <li> my hair is long and although it wrapped around my hair well, I wish it was longer to add a little weight to it.</li>
            <li> My only note is that if you have very long or thick hair, this product may not work as well for you.</li>
            <li> It dried my hair in about half the time of a regular cotton terry towel.  </li>
            <li> Cuts down my blowdryer time by at least 7 minutes (I have super thick hair)!</li>
            <li> I recently received this microfiber hair towel l and didn&#x27;t know what I was missing all this time!  </li>
            <li> This towel was sent to me to test as I have other products from this vendor</li>
            <li> After taking my shower I put this in my hair like I would any other towel and went one with getting dressed.</li>
            <li> My hair falls past my shoulders to mid-back and this couldn’t possibly wrap it all.  </li>
            <li> The fabric is unlike other microfiber towels I’ve used.</li>
            <li> I just had become accustomed to these dollar store hair towels and never really thought about finding another option!</li>
            <li> I received this to review as an active blogger.</li>
            <li> The towel is 19\\&quot; X 39\\&quot; - ample for drying the hair well and the brushed terry cloth microfiber towel does not pull hair unnecessarily, reducing the amount of hair left on the towel instead of plugged into the scalp!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li> After a few minutes in the wrap, my hair is as dry as it could get before blow drying.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m having a hard time getting it back from her</li>
            <li> /&gt;The towel is longer and narrower than an average towel.</li>
            <li> Finally discovered a microfiber hair towel that is designed for thick, longer hair types.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m afraid it wasn&#x27;t really worth the money or the endless attempts to re-tie it to my head!</li>
            <li> I put it down on my yoga mat while doing floor work.</li>
            <li> You may stagger out of the shower throw on a robe with a towel on your head while rushing to slurp down a cup of coffee.</li>
            <li> My hair was half dry after using it - and blow drying took little time at all!</li>
            <li> (past mid back) and a very very thick head of hair.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is I wish it were a tad longer because I have trouble tucking it under when it is on my head which makes it hard to move around.</li>
            <li> As a previous customer, I did receive this product as a promotion, but I think I will buy another one.</li>
            <li> As a previous Hydracentuals customer, I was given the opportunity to purchase and rate this product at a steep discount.</li>
            <li> a previous customer of Products from this seller</li>
            <li> As a previous customer of their water bottles, I was given the chance to test this towel.  </li>
            <li> Cuts my blow drying time in half.</li>
            <li> How could something less than a quarter</li>
            <li> composition is typical for microfiber, 80% polyester and 20% synthetic polyamide.  </li>
            <li> As a man, I don&#x27;t typically use a hair towel.  </li>
            <li> My hair dryer time is a lot less than before</li>
            <li> Not true.  </li>
            <li> No more rushing out the door with wet hair.</li>
            <li> Our daughter has long, thick hair</li>
            <li> I have long, thick and curly hair.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair and this towel has been a pleasure to use.</li>
            <li> , I have long, thick hair and the towel holds all my hair perfectly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair is down to my waste</li>
            <li> The problem is, like other reviewers have said, it&#x27;s just too small.  </li>
            <li> Could be a little wider.</li>
            <li> Little struggle with tying it,</li>
            <li> This towel seems to absorb water well, but I wish it was a little wider</li>
            <li> It is a little wider than specified at about 20 x 39 in.  </li>
            <li> A standard bathroom towel will stop my hair from dripping onto me after I get out of the shower, but it never even comes CLOSE to drying my hair (I have very thick hair).</li>
            <li> Ever since I got to try out this towel, I have been using it everyday to semi-dry my hair.</li>
            <li> I have tried to like it and have have given it a few months</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve waited a few weeks before writing my review as I wanted to use it for a bit to give it a valid test of use and washing afterwards.</li>
            <li> and now we know what we have been missing.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I use two towels to get my hair dried before styling or blow drying it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The feel is .. fluffy and seems like it would become soggy.</li>
            <li> With the Luxe Microfiber towel, I can wrap my hair without the towel feeling heavy on my head and the towel does the rest.</li>
            <li> The towels are just fluffy wonderful.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has cut my blow dry time in half, at least!</li>
            <li> hair is thick, hip length, and naturally curly, so I was skeptical when I saw the size of this towel.  </li>
            <li> I hate having wet hair, especially since I don&#x27;t have time to blow dry my hair.</li>
            <li> I used this microfiber towel and can I just say it was extremely luxurious feeling!!!</li>
            <li> Some microfiber rags I have used in the past stick to my skin.</li>
            <li> Not sure.</li>
            <li> My hair length is just past my shoulders, and this covers my hair well.</li>
            <li> It seems softer than microfiber usually is.</li>
            <li> Just arrived and anxious to use on my curly hair......</li>
            <li> My one negative comment is that the towel was too small to wrap all of my hair in.  </li>
            <li> My old towel was impossible to replace and, I am ashamed to admit, had holes in it from the years of use.</li>
            <li> When I took it out of my hair, my hair was hardly even damp.</li>
            <li> my drying time by at least 50%, which was the point in getting it.</li>
            <li> However, as of late, I&#x27;ve discovered that taking a morning shower and rushing out the door can lead to my hair going haywire.  </li>
            <li> Having thick hair</li>
            <li> Game changer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Applying heat, like a blow dryer, is one of the worse things you can do to your hair.</li>
            <li> Too bad for me as I have been seriously missing out!</li>
            <li> and it always felt unsettlingly wasteful.</li>
            <li> I must admit, I am horrible about going to bed with wet hair!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a very high quality hair towel. Immediately out of packaging you can feel how soft and luxurious it feels. It is a good size and is very effective. Upon use it is able to dry your hair very quickly and exhibits a high capacity for absorbing water. While drying it is able to dry well and even after extended use over a period of days still shows consistent quality and ability to absorb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it is a very good hair towel and is of really high quality; all for a very reasonable price. It is soft and nice to use, on top of doing its job very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was able to receive this product for testing for being a precious member of the company. They are very professional and have a fantastic fan base and excellent customer service</li>
            <li> Love it. Absorbs a lot.....quickly! Bought two!</li>
            <li> I recently received this microfiber hair towel l and didn&#x27;t know what I was missing all this time!  I usually use a regular towel that is dried from the sun, which is kind of hard.  I used this microfiber towel and can I just say it was extremely luxurious feeling!!! I cannot believe this gave me a feeling like I was at the spa.  I didn&#x27;t think I would be so excited about this Luxe Towel, but I was totally!  I noticed that when I dried my hair with this towel the next few times, it definitely made a difference in that my split ends looked less frizzy.  It was not harsh on my hair like the sun dried towel.  It is the perfect size for anyone&#x27;s head.  It will work for long or short.  I have long hair and it bundled it up just right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why should you use this microfiber towel as opposed to a regular cotton one?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion, it is because it is more gently on the hair.  I didn&#x27;t notice a rapid drying time with it, but this towel did seem to give me a 10 minute head start on the drying time.  If I used a cotton towel, it didn&#x27;t absorb as good as this microfiber towel did. I received this to review as an active blogger. Thank you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is 80% polyester and 20% polyamide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Machine wash warm&lt;br /&gt;Tumble dry on medium&lt;br /&gt;Do not Iron&lt;br /&gt;Do not Bleach&lt;br /&gt;Do not use fabric softener</li>
            <li> Best Towel Period. I got a chance to test this wonderful towel and found it amazing. It drys my hair well. It goes to the gym with me. I put it down on my yoga mat while doing floor work. Really, how many more uses can I find for this towel. I want to convert all of my bathroom hand towels to these. Lovely!</li>
            <li> Not as absorbent as I would&#x27;ve liked.</li>
            <li> I really love this soft hair towel. It&#x27;s the perfect size to wrap around my hair. It absorbs absolutely well too. I like how extremely soft it is that I could probably use it as a towrl for my baby girl&#x27;s delicate skin. Ever since I got to try out this towel, I have been using it everyday to semi-dry my hair. I would definitely recommend this product to all girl&#x27;s who want a softer towel to protect their hair from any more damage. (I was given this product to review and give my 100% opinion on it.)</li>
            <li> Excellent quality, I just wish they would sell a package with 2 or 3  at a better price.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Very nice quality by far and  I must say a very wonderful company to deal with by far!!!</li>
            <li> I am reviewing this item.  These comments are mine and only mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this towel.  The first time I used it, I was pleasantly surprised to find how quickly the towel absorbed the water from my hair.  Because it absorbed the moisture so quickly, I didn&#x27;t need to rub the towel rapidly through my hair therefore making my hair&#x27;s final resut smoother with less fly-away strands.  The towel, itself, became dry much faster than an ordinary towel.  My one negative comment is that the towel was too small to wrap all of my hair in.  I understand that this size is really meant for shorter hair.  I look forward to the opportunity to have the larger sized towel.  It will be the ONLY towel I use on my hair.</li>
            <li> I think I have shoulder length hair of medium thickness - not especially long at all - and I bought this towel a few months based on the positive reveiws. In short, it&#x27;s a decent towel but it certainly isn&#x27;t long enough to hold my hair in place for any measurable time. Any attempts to move about whilst wearing it result in it falling off and I often end up returning to my original towels in frustration. I also have not noticed any additional absorbancy or benefit from using this microfiber towel. I have tried to like it and have have given it a few months but I&#x27;m afraid it wasn&#x27;t really worth the money or the endless attempts to re-tie it to my head!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used hair towels before so wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect, but I it cut down the time to blow dry my hair by half somehow! It&#x27;s also really nice not to use a full towel on my hair as it cuts down on my laundry. The towel dries quickly so by the next morning it&#x27;s completely dry and ready to use again! The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars was because I wish it was just a little bigger....my hair is long and although it wrapped around my hair well, I wish it was longer to add a little weight to it. As a previous customer, I did receive this product as a promotion, but I think I will buy another one.</li>
            <li> Love it. Soft and it works. Just wish it was bigger for longer hair.</li>
            <li> This towel is kind of amazing. I have very dry curly Afro American hair and I can dry my hair with this towel with only a few swipes through my hair. It absorbs the water easily without completely drying it out and making it brittle. This towel was sent to me to test as I have other products from this vendor and I&#x27;m so glad that I chose to give it a try and a review. I&#x27;ve waited a few weeks before writing my review as I wanted to use it for a bit to give it a valid test of use and washing afterwards. It wasn&#x27;t clear to me what the difference could possibly be with a towel but this is proof that there are more absorbent materials that can be utilized. I really like it and I swim 4 to 5 times a week, this is the towel I use on my hair after washing my hair in the shower. Give it a try!</li>
            <li> I love this towel!  It&#x27;s very light weight so it doesn&#x27;t fall off of my head as I move around.  I have long hair and the microfiber is very absorbent.  I&#x27;ve washed the towel following the directions to not use fabric softener, and it held it&#x27;s shape and the color stayed bright.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a prior customer, I was provided this item for review.</li>
            <li> Works amazing for drying natural hair before air drying. I also wrapped my hair in it before going to bed and by morning it was completely dry, which is rare for me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have long hair at all but I don&#x27;t like using a robe after showering so I use a towel to dry off completely.  All I can say is this is perfect for that.  Most other towels are not as soft and definitely not as absorbent.  This towel feels so nice on the skin and dries me off completely unlike most regular towels.  Hopefully see more colors soon.&lt;br /&gt; Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review</li>
            <li> Ok so all my girl friends always talk about how great microfiber towels are for drying your hair. So I could not pass up the opportunity to use this one.  First of its sooooo soft. Like really soft. Some microfiber rags I have used in the past stick to my skin. This one was just so soft there was none of that. And it could be just different uses different textures. Not sure. After taking my shower I put this in my hair like I would any other towel and went one with getting dressed. When I took it out of my hair, my hair was hardly even damp. I could not believe it. My hair is usually still dripping wet after using a regular towel. This actually worked. Super impressed with this. And the quality of the towel seems very good. The only thing I wish is that it was a bit bigger. For girls with longer hair. Other wise great towel. This product was provided to me free for the purpose of inspection and my honest unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> The towel itself is great.  Very soft, very absorbant, dries quickly.  It seems to help a litle bit with my frizz - but that could be wishful thinking.  The problem is, like other reviewers have said, it&#x27;s just too small.  It&#x27;s jusssst big enough to put up in a turban, and tuck about 1/2 inch at the nape of my neck, but even then it tends to fall down most of the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to buy this towel, do an Amazon search for the 23&amp;#34; x 40&amp;#34; one, and buy it instead.</li>
            <li> Works nice with my long hair. Could be a little wider.</li>
            <li> So I bought this towel thinking to myself ... yeah right this is never gonna work...  Washed my hair and had it up in the towel for about 5 minutes. The towel was quite wet and my hair was a little more than damp.  I didn&#x27;t think it would work but it sure did. Amazing! I would recommend and I will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li> I have long and thick hair and have been searching for a special towel to use exclusively after showers.  This microfiber hair towel is great!  Not only is it absorbent BUT because, again, my hair is long and thick, its thin and light design doesn&#x27;t add weight to my neck when I&#x27;m walking around with it on.  This is a huge plus for me as other towels have actually caused neck strain when balled up on my head combined with heavy wet hair.  I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a solid, quality hair towel. As a prior customer I was provided a sample for review.</li>
            <li> This has changed my life. I have wavy hair that has always been a frizz bomb. I use the &amp;#34;squish to condish&amp;#34; method and wrap my hair in this towel...and my hair friggin rocks. Game changer.</li>
            <li> These towels feel great on the skin. Both hair and body towels are great</li>
            <li> Do not think that I have ever felt a towel as soft as this towel from Luxe Beauty Essentials. Did not really expect it to be as plush and absorbent as it is, and have been amazed. Our daughter has long, thick hair and she likes to wrap it up after showering, and once she tried this towel she claimed it as forever hers. Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on the information provided by the seller, one of the main components that sets this apart from other towels is its double sided brushed terry composition.  This super soft towel just seems to suck up the water from your hair without a whole lot of effort on your part, making it a gentle and less damaging way to dry hair. At 19 x 39 inches, this towel is just the right size for our daughter to wrap around her medium-long, fairly thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have never owned a towel specifically designed as a &#x27;hair towel&#x27;, but now we do and now we know what we have been missing. This will not be the last of these hair towels that we get; as noted, it is time for me to go purchase one too, since my daughter has absconded with this first one. Smart girl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Amazon sales page notes that this towel is covered by a satisfaction guarantee which reads \\&quot;Customer satisfaction guaranteed! Love it or your money back.\\&quot;... well, we already love it so no issue here. However, if something wacky happens to change that opinion, I will return here to update the review and let you know what the issue was and how resolution was handled. We did receive this great towel gratis from the seller and have put it through the paces to objectively find out how well it performed. My statements here reflect that testing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This towel is so soft that it feels great on the face and body too. If you are looking for a towel of this size, absorbency, softness, price and overall great quality, for use as I have described above, then we highly recommend this Luxe Beauty Essentials Hair Towel based on our experience with it... just consider buying an extra if you have kids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go for it. Highly recommended.ider buying an extra if you have kids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go for it. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Love the size and everything about this towel.  Please, a word of warning.  Never wash microfiber in bleach.  Someone mentioned in one product review, not necessarily this one.. I just don&#x27;t remember, but the the point was buying white so you could bleach it clean.  I&#x27;ve read many times bleaching microfiber breaks down the fibers so they don&#x27;t perform as intended.  Great seller!  Don&#x27;t hesitate.. you need this.  I would buy more!</li>
            <li> This very finely made plush microfiber towel may be designed for the ladies with long hair who care about how long it takes to dry those beautiful tresses with an emphasis on hair protection, but for men this towel is equally effective - especially as we age and the amount of hair loss each day is exacerbated by rough, tough towel drying of the hair (or worse yet, speeding up the process with a hair dryer!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This towel is another fine concept from Kristen Darkenwald - that lady who cares enough about her products to test each one herself. The towel is 19\\&quot; X 39\\&quot; - ample for drying the hair well and the brushed terry cloth microfiber towel does not pull hair unnecessarily, reducing the amount of hair left on the towel instead of plugged into the scalp!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once again, here is a thoughtful product that is made with the consumer&#x27;s well being in mind. Highly recommended for both females and males - a Unisex towel! Grady Harp, September 14</li>
            <li> I must admit, I am horrible about going to bed with wet hair! I put my long hair in a bun and go right to bed. My pillow is always wet and so are my headbands. I never blow dry my hair because I will end up looking like a poodle! I don’t towel dry my hair because regular towels are too heavy to keep on my head. I was super excited about receiving the Luxe Beauty Essential Microfiber Hair Towel because it is specifically made to dry your hair! It is soooo soft and nice! I seriously am considering purchasing a few of these for the lovely ladies in my family. I think they would make a great addition to a bath and body gift basket!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every night after I shower, I wrap my hair in this. My hair is down to my waste so I have to fold my hair into it because it isn’t wide enough to cover the full length of my hair. That is okay though, it still sits very comfortably on my head! Because it is microfiber, it dries incredibly quickly! It doesn’t even feel wet after using it. I love it. My hair is dry enough to sleep without my pillow getting wet! Finally! I would definitely recommend this to anyone! It would make a great gift!</li>
            <li> I have been loving this towel since I got it in the mail! I find myself reaching for it over my regular towels all the time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The towel is pretty basic, its your normal plush microfiber material which is super soft, but also very absorbent. My hair length is just past my shoulders, and this covers my hair well. I find when I use this type of material on my hair, it doesn&#x27;t become so frizzy after washing. Plus my dry time is faster while using this towel as well since it is so absorbent. I also like to use this towel when I am doing my own at home spa treatment. Because it is so incredibly soft, I can use it on my face and around my eyes without any scratching of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I urge you to wash and dry this towel before using to allow it to work with optimum results. Washing this is very easy. Wash as normal, but be sure NOT to use fabric softener with this. I tend to wash mine with my kitchen towels instead of in with my regular laundry just so I&#x27;m sure I don&#x27;t accidentally toss in it with a load that I added fabric softener to. Dries fast, and hardly any lint. Stains remove from this pretty easy if you catch them early enough. I use a spray laundry stain remover, let it set for 5 minutes, then toss it in the washing machine and the towel came out stain free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give this Luxe Beauty Essentials towel 5 stars. It does all that it claims, and I enjoy using it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
            <li> Great for your wavy to curly hair plop towel. I agree that a t-shirt works just as well as this towel, but it&#x27;s nice to a have a dedicated towel. Little struggle with tying it, but I&#x27;m getting better with time.</li>
            <li> At first glance, the Luxe hair towel looked a bit on the small side.  My hair falls past my shoulders to mid-back and this couldn’t possibly wrap it all.  Not true.  Although the width will not cover it, the length does.  When I have it all up, only a few strands might peek through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s soft and absorbent, more so than my turban style towels.  After a few minutes in the wrap, my hair is as dry as it could get before blow drying.  No dripping mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works well, but I’d still like a little more width.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was provided for review by Hydracentials.</li>
            <li> I have used a lot of different hair towels (even microfiber ones) in the past but this one is absolutely the best! It is the softest towel I have ever used. I just love it. It is very absorbent. It washes well and retains its softness afterwards. I have long hair and this towel is just large enough, but I just wish it was a tad bit bigger.&lt;br /&gt;*I received a free product for review, but this review is totally unbiased. I am in love with this towel!</li>
            <li> The small business owner of this company is very passionate about her products and goes to the extreme To provide the best quality. As a previous Hydracentuals customer, I was given the opportunity to purchase and rate this product at a steep discount. What an awesome product. I have long, thick and curly hair. Sometimes I use two towels to get my hair dried before styling or blow drying it. Not anymore. This microfiber hair towel does the trick. Pas advertised, this towel is very soft and has done well with my hair.</li>
            <li> Love this towel.  Great for curly hair.</li>
            <li> I was given the chance to try out this towel for free, how great is that? After purchasing their great Hydracentials bottle, I jumped at a chance to try other products.&lt;br /&gt;The towel feels great, I just wish it were longer. It doesn&#x27;t cover the length of my hair, leaving some of it sticking out and dripping. It would be great if it were longer and perhaps had a loop to keep the towel in place.</li>
            <li> As a customer of other products from this company,i am so glad to get this product to be able to use it and get the true joy of having my child and me cherish parenting.My child loves this plush microfiber towel more than me.Its quality is so good that even after 10 washes,it has regained its color and texture.Its a multipurpose cloth , a towel ,a wash cloth and a head massage wrap cloth!I love this product and would definately recommend it.</li>
            <li> This gets my hair so dry. No more dripping wet hair after the shower and it is supposedly better for your hair than regualr towels. I haven&#x27;t had any issues with the threading or the material. It seems softer than microfiber usually is. I love it and I would recommend it to anyone who doesn&#x27;t like waiting too long after the shower for their hair to dry.</li>
            <li> Really cuts down on hair drying time. Planning on buying a couple more.</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift. Wow! It has cut my blow dry time in half, at least! Incredible absorbancy &amp; softness! I wish I could buy a bath towel like this - what a luxurious feel! Effective and a treat at once!</li>
            <li> I love this hair towel, it is so soft and dries my hair really fast!</li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair and this towel has been a pleasure to use. Unlike using a full-size towel, it&#x27;s much lighter on your head and stays in place well. If you are going to be moving around a lot, you can just use a hair clip to secure the back. The material is extremely soft and plush, but dries quickly. You&#x27;ll feel like you&#x27;ve gone to the spa after every shower. This is a great little investment, especially for ladies with long hair.</li>
            <li> I am a customer of this company and have bought several items.  I was given this item to test and I found it works very well,  I don&#x27;t have long hair but my hair seems to hold water after shampooing.  This is a nice size towel and being microfiber it is absorbent.  Make sure you don&#x27;t use fabric softener beause that will mess up the absorbency.  I like it alot.</li>
            <li> Having a hair towel never seemed like something I was going to run out and get, but now that I have one, I suspect I will never be without again! I love the super soft fabric this is made of. It is easy to wash, and holds up to quite a bit of abuse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the way it sucks moisture out of my hair- so much better than using a regular terry cloth towel! Plus it makes for just a smidgen more room in the washer on towel day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I had ordered this before I cut my hair so short!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much for providing a sample of this product for review on my blog!</li>
            <li> I used this towel to dry my very hairy Lhasa Apso dog.  I have only used regular bath towels before so I was truly impressed at how well this towel absorbs the water.  I barely had to use the blow dryer this time around since the towel absorbed the damp fur.  Fur dried very quickly.  I definitely need to get some more for Xmas gifts since I have a ton of female family members!</li>
            <li> This is a great towel. It is super soft. Probably the softest towel I have ever felt. It absorbs water well. The only reason I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is I wish it were a tad longer because I have trouble tucking it under when it is on my head which makes it hard to move around.</li>
            <li> The Luxe Beauty Microfiber Hair Towel looked like the perfect alternative to simply sleeping with wet hair (this isn&#x27;t really comfortable in the winter), or to leaving my hair wet in the morning when flying out the door on the rare occasion that I take a shower in the morning. It is really as soft as it looks in the pictures; I didn&#x27;t even know what I was missing! A standard bathroom towel will stop my hair from dripping onto me after I get out of the shower, but it never even comes CLOSE to drying my hair (I have very thick hair). The Luxe Beauty Microfiber Hair Towel did an excellent job of leaving my hair much more dry by morning, and even less unruly! It felt more like a spa treatment than anything; I would envision myself using a towel this plush at a salon or any sort of spa. It is so comfortable and easy to use, and kept my hair piled on top of my head all throughout the night. I can&#x27;t stress how much better this towel is than any normal bath towel..they don&#x27;t compare at all! The material is so much more absorptive and comfortable. The towel was not soaked after my shower like a normal bath towel, even though it had removed most of the water and moisture from my hair. This made it much faster to dry itself when simply hanging it over the top of the shower. In the washer and dryer, it came out without any damage (for me) and still retained its amazing, plush quality. I definitely recommend this to my fellow beauty lovers! I honestly didn&#x27;t think I would be blown away by a towel, but I really was.</li>
            <li> I purchased these microfiber hair towels to use for my grandsons hair after their swimming lessons. They absorb quickly and gently. Another plus is their size, fit well with other swimming essentials in little boys backpacks. They machine wash and dry without wear.&lt;br /&gt;Of course they are perfect for longer grownups hair too. I Recommend them for personnel use and gifts.</li>
            <li> This towel is AMAZING. I wish I had more! It&#x27;s ridiculously soft and the perfect size for my long hair. I&#x27;ve also been using it for my baby--he just loves to snuggle with that soft towel. We line dry, which normally leaves all of our towels like sand paper...but not this! Very luxurious and definitely worth way more than what it costs.&lt;br /&gt;I received this free for review purposes.</li>
            <li> My wife uses a microfiber hair towel every day and was looking for a new one to replace her old ones from many years. Settled with this one because of great reviews and size dimensions were perfect. Well after using for a week, she insisted I buy another because she threw out all of her old towels and replaced with these. According to her, these things are amazingly absorbent, perfectly sized to wrap around your wet head, and are very soft and durable. She plans to buy some more as xmas gifts and would recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li> Love this towel it does dry your hair faster</li>
            <li> I do not have long hair, but I do get all sweaty and this is the perfect cloth for a quick wipe down. I received mine as a review sample.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The feel is .. fluffy and seems like it would become soggy. On the contrary, this is one of the most effective drying cloths or towels I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to it&#x27;s quick drying qualities, it dries out in practically no time when hung across a shower rod. Moreover, this is perfect for the beach (especially after you&#x27;ve hosed the same off yourself), and is also ideal on camping trips. It&#x27;s low maintenance in the field, and cleans easily too. Do know that you cannot use bleach on this, nor a fabric softener (per the instructions that came with mine.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this towel is so nice that I am considering purchasing additional ones to give as holiday gifts. Seriously, they are that nice, and when a towel can impress a 65 year old man you know it&#x27;s special.</li>
            <li> Nice but still on the small side.  I gave it a 4 star because I felt it was a bit pricy for what you get.  $20 for a  a towel not much longer than a hand towel...  That said.  I understand it is still much larger than the  other  towel sold for hair by Devacurl.</li>
            <li> I have never owned a hair towel- didn&#x27;t even know of such a thing, but oh my goodness I am sold on this product. I tried my towel out this morning and let&#x27;s just say, &amp;#34; it has been a good hair day&amp;#34;!  I can&#x27;t believe how much water this towel absorbs! My hair was half dry after using it - and blow drying took little time at all! This has to be better for my hair.  My hair is not long, but I imagine that for long hair this towel would be such a time saver.&lt;br /&gt;Also, it is so soft and feels wonderful on my head.  I plan to get one for my daughter and her long hair real soon!&lt;br /&gt;As a previous customer of Products from this seller, I am once again completely satisfied and confident to share my feedback.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent microfiber towel. The fabric is unlike other microfiber towels I’ve used. Rather than be paper thin, this is rather  plush and cushy (as far as microfiber goes – it’s no where near as thick as a good conventional cotton towel). It feels wonderful – very soft and scratch free. It’s also hugely absorbent, soaking up water quickly and holding it well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The construction quality is excellent. Zero loose threads, and a well-stitched hem all-around. It’s a bright white color. While it’s smaller than a bath towel, it’s larger than the typical hand towel. The 19 by 39 size is a nice balance between big enough to be highly useful but still small enough to stow easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this is billed as a hair towel I find it more useful for other purposes, such as a face towel and a towel to take along to the gym. (It’s not that it doesn’t work well as a hair towel, it’s just that my hair quantity and density is such that I could probably get by with a paper towel or two for hair-drying.) It is easy to fit into a gym bag and it air-drys very quickly. And, of course, it is perfect for traveling since who would leave home without their towel?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very nicely done, and I would highly recommend this.&lt;br /&gt;[Sample provided for review]</li>
            <li> Very soft and usable with a great absorption rate. Although I was provided this for free to test, I would have easily bought this.</li>
            <li> As a previous customer of their water bottles, I was given the chance to test this towel.  Having thick hair I need something to help dry my hair after a shower.  This towel seems to absorb water well, but I wish it was a little wider so I could better wrap my hair and still have enough room to tuck in the end easily.  I managed to make it work, and it&#x27;s easier to use than a full size towel, but not as easy as I wanted.</li>
            <li> Having used the same towel to dry my hair for years, I was quick to agree to review the hair towel. My old towel was impossible to replace and, I am ashamed to admit, had holes in it from the years of use. But no other towel seemed to dry my hair as well. Until this one! It is just the right size, does an amazing job of drying my hair even faster than my old towel, and my hair does not seem as frizzy. So with a great sense of relief I am able to throw away the old and replace it with an even better new!!</li>
            <li> This towel is so very soft! I love it! It dries your hair quickly. It&#x27;s not big and bulky. It&#x27;s good that it&#x27;s not big because it takes up very little room, but I also like my towels a little bigger. They are easier to wrap around my head of hair. It certainly washed up wonderfully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a professional blogger that got this product as a review item. I give only my honest opinion when review products.</li>
            <li> This towel is thicker than I imagined and very soft. It works great to finish drying my hair and also as a wrap for my wet hair.&lt;br /&gt;Applying heat, like a blow dryer, is one of the worse things you can do to your hair. I like my hair to look and feel soft and healthy, so I rarely blow dry my hair. As much as I try, I can never get it dry enough with a normal towel to not have the water eventually drain to the ends of my hair and inevitably leave me with a wet shirt. Wrapping my hair in a normal towel a la turban style is cumbersome and heavy and doesn’t lead to good results anyway. With the Luxe Microfiber towel, I can wrap my hair without the towel feeling heavy on my head and the towel does the rest. When I remove the towel, my hair is dry enough to no longer leave the back of my shirt or my furniture wet. The towel air dries quickly. I only have one, so I do use it multiple times between washes.&lt;br /&gt;Sample received for review.</li>
            <li> Beauty Luxe Essentials sent me the Plush Microfiber Hair Towel to review for my blog GlamRiver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As soon as you feel the towel in your hands you know It&#x27;s a great quality towel, it&#x27;s so soft!  The towel is also the prefect size too.  I wrap my hair up as soon as I get out of the shower and it really helps dry my hair a lot faster and cuts my drying time to almost half which means less damage to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I have long, thick hair and the towel holds all my hair perfectly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;:)</li>
            <li> Perfect for drying hair. Very soft, not irritating like some microfiber cloths.&lt;br /&gt;Beautiful white color and pleasant to use.</li>
            <li> I hate having wet hair, especially since I don&#x27;t have time to blow dry my hair. Normal towels just aren&#x27;t absorbent enough, so I end up walking around with my hair dripping everywhere, resulting in wet spots on my shirt and/or pillow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This towel does an amazing job of helping me hair dry faster. I just wrap it around my hair on top of my head for about 5-10 minutes, and my hair is dry enough that there isn&#x27;t any dripping or wet spots on my shirt. I&#x27;m sure it could dry my hair even more if I could leave it on longer, but that&#x27;s not easy when chasing after a toddler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The towel is extremely soft, which I love. I am not a fan of regular towels since they are a bit rough. I&#x27;ve actually considered getting another one for drying my son off after his baths since he is sensitive to some textures and won&#x27;t let me dry him for very long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did have a problem with this not being big enough for all of my hair. I had a bit of a struggle trying to get it to cover all of my hair at once. I also really wish it was available in more colors than just white. I&#x27;m a bit worried about this staining after I dye my hair since I tend to leach color for about a week after I dye it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a very good product that I really enjoy using. If it were bigger and had more color options, it would be perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample for review purposes. All opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nothing special but it&#x27;s better than using my husband&#x27;s ripped up t-shirts. My hair is pretty long and the ends peak through because it&#x27;s too short. I haven&#x27;t notice a speed up of drying time.</li>
            <li> I have used many hair towels over the years, but this one definitely helps dry my hair the fastest! Cuts down my blowdryer time by at least 7 minutes (I have super thick hair)! My only wish is that this towel had the twist function and loop on it that some other hair towels have in order to keep it in place...I see this as a tiny trade off for a towel that actually works!!! And Kristen offers great customer service as always!</li>
            <li> I used to get out of the shower and scrub my hair with a regular towel.  Then I would have to spend more time working out the snarles.  Now, I just get out of the shower and wrap my hair in this microfiber hair towel without any scrubbing at all.  The towel absorbs the water from my hair and I am able to simply brush out and blow dry.  My hair is super soft and tangle free!.  Plus the towel is so soft and fluffy.  I loved it so much I bought another for my sister and my nieces!</li>
            <li> Wife;s Review: Initially I forgot to use it but before blow drying my wet hair, I used this to wrap my hair to see if I could take out more moisture before blow drying my hair. It worked amazingly well! The dryer your hair is prior to blow drying, the less damage it would be for your hair. This product did just that.My only note is that if you have very long or thick hair, this product may not work as well for you. The towel is relatively short. My hair is armpit level and even I had hair ends sticking out. I used to have waist length hair and I think this product may not have been long enough to wrap all my hair. I also have fine thin hair so if you have thicker lush hair, this towel might not be big enough.</li>
            <li> Generous size, soft, absorbent and plush.</li>
            <li> Just arrived and anxious to use on my curly hair......</li>
            <li> Just gotta say, this is one perfect towel. Earlier in my life I was a cosmetologist. I thought I liked those towels - NOT! Well, maybe, because I love, love, love this one! Now, I must admit, I&#x27;m a towel freak, so, when I say I love a towel, this is some serious business! Once I get all my stuff settled since we&#x27;ve moved back home following a fire last April, I plan on buying more and suggest you do the same - awesome towel!</li>
            <li> I was given one of these hair towels to try out and offer my honest opinion.  First of all, I have to say that I have very long (past mid back) and a very very thick head of hair.  I almost always let my hair air dry after wrapping it up in a towel for a while and really only blow dry for special occasions.  All that said, I thought this would be a great product for me to try out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was impressed by the quality of the towel when I received it and true to the other reviews it is super soft and comfortable yet fairly thin and light weight.  I have already washed this towel a couple times through the washer/dryer and it has come out exactly as new, super soft, every time.  It is extremely absorbent as after wrapping my hair up in this vs. my usual bath towel, it takes notably less time for my hair to dry on its own.  The only reason I am giving it 4 vs. 5 stars is because of my long thick hair, it is just a bit too small to stay securely wrapped.  It would be perfect if it was just a few inches longer for my needs.  I absolutely love this material and would LOVE a larger version to use as a gym towel!</li>
            <li> I have pretty long hair and this towel is just long enough to get it all when I wrap it up. The towel isn&#x27;t as big as I thought, but it does well enough. It dries my hair quite well and dries itself out quickly. I just wish it was a bit bigger.</li>
            <li> Actually works very well.  Nice product, but my wife&#x27;s shortish hair dries too quickly so she does not use as often as other one she has.  If you want a nice size towel to dry thick or long hair, it should work great.</li>
            <li> I will never go back to a normal towel for my hair.  Ever.  I was really excited to try this hair towel.  I had heard of them and was curious if it would help dry my hair faster with less damage to it.  The hype is true.  It&#x27;s soooo absorbent.  As soon as I took the towel out of the plastic wrap, I fell in love with the softness.  It&#x27;s a super high quality plush microfiber.  It reminds me of those Kleenex tissues that have the lotion in them.  I couldn&#x27;t wait to wash my hair and try it out.  I wrapped my hair up in the towel as soon as I stepped out of the shower.  It just barely covered all of my hair because I have long hair (to the middle of my back) but I liked that it wasn&#x27;t heavy and bulky like typical towels.  I was only able to leave it on for maybe 10-15 minutes because we had to be somewhere.  As soon as I took it off I gently hand-dried my hair with it for a minute.  Immediately I noticed my hair was already really dry.  With an average bath towel it would take another hour to be that dry.  My hair felt really soft and happy too.  I styled it as usual and it looked great.  I am so excited to use this towel in the morning when I&#x27;m rushing to get ready for work.  I never have time to wait for my hair to dry in a normal towel so it takes forever to blow dry it and half the time it&#x27;s still damp underneath because I just don&#x27;t have the time.  This microfiber towel is such a big time saver for me.  It feels so luxurious as well, it made me feel like I was at the spa.  I received this product in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.  I highly recommend this hair towel to everyone, especially those who require a lot of time drying their hair.</li>
            <li> Finally a microfiber towel large enough to work as a turban. This actually cuts&lt;br /&gt;down my drying time by at least 50%, which was the point in getting it. Love&lt;br /&gt;this product.</li>
            <li> Cuts my blow drying time in half.</li>
            <li> My two sons usually take a bath before going to bed, and the wet hair is always a problem, my wife used a hair dryer, its obviously too noisy and she worries about how it affects their hair. She is very happy with the towel, she is no longer using the dryer, with our 2 year old she actually uses it to dry his whole body, its very soft and does not seem to get wet before she is done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This towel was sent to me for review at no cost after buying a few of their Luxe Beauty and Hydracentials products , and like those, this is good quality stuff</li>
            <li> This towel is so perfect for drying hair. The size and shape works perfectly for any hair length (I don&#x27;t have a lot of hair on top, but some on the sides - it works for me; my wife has lovely shoulder length thick hair it also works perfectly for her).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The towel is longer and narrower than an average towel. The shape and weight makes it so easy to wrap up your hair, turban style. Oh my goodness this absorbs water. The towels are just fluffy wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The edges have a reinforced blanket stitch that will prevent the towel from fraying. Many years ago I bought Aquis towels, one of the early microfiber towels. Because they didn&#x27;t have that stitching, they have frayed. The world of microfiber is so much better now. These Luxe towels feel like a cloud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This would make a great workout towel. Roll it up and wrap it around your neck. The soft ends are perfect for wiping sweat off your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a review sample.</li>
            <li> I love being pleasantly surprised by a product.  I was definitely impressed at how wonderfully this towel performs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is thick, hip length, and naturally curly, so I was skeptical when I saw the size of this towel.  I usually use a huge bath sheet to dry my hair.  How could something less than a quarter the size do the job?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I&#x27;m happy to say it worked nicely!  This towel is super absorbent, and very soft.  It dried my hair in about half the time of a regular cotton terry towel.  The towel itself also dries fairly quickly, too, when you&#x27;re done with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The size means it will be easy to pack and take on my trips -- instead of relying on hotel towels, I&#x27;ll have something that works much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I was provided a sample for review purposes; my opinions are my own based on my experience with this product.)</li>
            <li> This microfiber towel is almost unbelievably soft and plush on both sides.  It is a little wider than specified at about 20 x 39 in.  The edges are serged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It weighs about 185g dry, 890g soaking wet but not dripping, and 525g when the water is squeezed out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The incredible absorbency and the generous size make it an excellent choice for wrapping wet hair or even for drying baby at bathtime.  It is hard to resist using on the body because it is so soft and it works well as a face towel, too.  It makes me feel a bit spoiled!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The composition is typical for microfiber, 80% polyester and 20% synthetic polyamide.  Care is easy:  machine wash in warm water without bleach or fabric softener and tumble on low or hang to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Healthy Life Essentials provided a towel for evaluation and review.</li>
            <li> ok i hopped in the shower yesterday and almost forgot about this then remember oo i have that new towel i was sent to try out and review so i grabbed it wrapped my hair in it and hoped for the best, the towel was soooooo soft i couldnt believe it! in less than 5 minutes my hair that is down to the middle of my back was completely dry! i was speechless never seen anything like this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;No monitory compensation was received ( i was given the product free to review with no intention on compensation). I was not required to write a positive review (and sometimes not required to at all). Your experience may differ. The opinions I have expressed are my own and only that of mine!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> My daughter and I fell in love with this the minute we touched it. It is super soft and just the right size for wrapping around a head of hair. When I get out of the shower, I dry off and try to wrap my head with my bath towel but it is bulky. So I end up with a wet head for quite awhile. This is great for wrapping your head after drying off to help absorb additional moisture so that you don&#x27;t have to blow dry it for as long. My daughter loves it and I&#x27;m having a hard time getting it back from her but since her hair is longer than mine, I guess she can keep using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review.</li>
            <li> The Luxe Beauty Essential Plush Microsoft Hair towel is extremely soft. Very gentle on your hair. The size of the towel is perfect for my long hair. Super absorbent. I have never been one to blow dry my hair. When I used this towel I felt that after 20 minutes of wearing the towel my hair was nearly dry. I absolutely love this towel. I put it on after getting out of the shower, stays on nicely. You can feel the towel absorb the water from my hair right away. I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality of this towel is Luxurious!</li>
            <li> As a man, I don&#x27;t typically use a hair towel.  However, as of late, I&#x27;ve discovered that taking a morning shower and rushing out the door can lead to my hair going haywire.  So, when I&#x27;m in a rush, it&#x27;s nice to have something to quickly dry my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This hair towel is the right size and does the job just right. It dries my hair quickly and allows me to brush and comb before I head out the door, even when I&#x27;m in a hurry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a side note: I was provided a free version of this product as a previous customer of this vendor&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li> This hair towel is a simple design in a luxuriously soft and comfortable fabric that wicks water away. It&#x27;s lightweight, easy to use, and makes me feel like I&#x27;m at a spa when I get out of the shower. It quickly takes my medium length hair from soaking wet to damp, without any uncomfortable drips down my neck and back. I was offered a sample of this product to test and review honestly, and I honestly think it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this towel.  I have other microfiber absorbing hair towels, so I thought this would be just like the others.  WRONG - it&#x27;s so much better than my others now I want to throw my others away (that I bought from a store).  This towel is 19&amp;#34;x39&amp;#34;, plenty big to wrap it around my entire head and not have to fight to get it so it doesn&#x27;t fall off.  By the time I put my makeup on, about 5 minutes, and took my hair towel off, I didn&#x27;t have any dripping hair ends.  This towel is so absorbent it didn&#x27;t take me long to dry my hair.  My hair turned out the same as it would with my other towels, it looks great.  I would definitely buy this towel again, and again, and again. As a prior customer, I was provided this item for review, but this is my honest opinion.  I honestly love this towel.</li>
            <li> Love this!!! I wash my hair, wrapp it up and 5 min later my hair is moist. My hair dryer time is a lot less than before</li>
            <li> Everything I wanted and more! Super absorbent, drys hair in about half an hour, then I blow dry for 90 seconds to perfection.  Replacing all my towels to this type because they are great to dry off with.  They are a great length too!  I can wrap around my head easily.</li>
            <li> Soft, absorbent luxury hair towel.  My hair is almost dry by the time I am ready to style it.  I have fine hair and don&#x27;t like to use the blow dryer very much because of heat damage.  This towel if perfect.</li>
            <li> I definitely love this towel. I was surprised by how soft it was. It&#x27;s the perfect size for my long hair. I can wrap it up easy.&lt;br /&gt;I have long but thin hair and it falls out easily. I&#x27;ve noticed less breakage using this towel as it is tons more softer and is made to not damage your hair as you dry it. I have stopped blow drying my hair and haven&#x27;t but maybe once or twice in last year. I towel then air dry. My hair is so much more healthier. This towel is perfect for me. It&#x27;s so soft and is double sided and absorbs the water so you don&#x27;t have to be so rough on your hair trying to dry it off with a towel.&lt;br /&gt;I did receive this product for free but the experience and opinions are my own and my only compensation was this product.</li>
            <li> No one wants to spend all day trying to get ready for the start of the day. We have showers or baths to take, hair to wash and for some makeup to be applied and all is time consuming.  If you happen to not be a morning person then you probably don’t allow yourself very much time to get ready in the morning. You may stagger out of the shower throw on a robe with a towel on your head while rushing to slurp down a cup of coffee. While slurping on your coffee you rummage for the hair dryer and begin the daunting task of drying your hair. Why does this seem to take up so much time? If you happen to have long hair then you know that when you unwrap that wet towel your hair may still be wet. No short cuts there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair drying with a hair dryer tends to cause your hair to become more brittle. You really have to be careful using too much heat on your hair.  If you color your hair the extra heat can cause your color to fade out quicker and that can in turn cost you a lot more money. Who has money to just throw away anymore?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Microfiber is being used today especially in towels. It has proven to be very absorbent and it is even being widely used in many baby items like diapers because it so soft. Luxe Beauty Essential has designed a microfiber towel that can be purposely used for your hair. It is so soft and gentle on your hair and absorbency reduces the drying time.  Shortcuts finally. The towel is 19” x 39”, not as big and bulky as a bath towel but larger than a hand towel. It’s the perfect size for wrapping your hair. The microfiber fabric absorbs so much of the water that your hair is almost dry when you unwrap it. Less time with a hot dryer and less damage likely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Promotional or discounted product provided for review.</li>
            <li> I have been using those dollar store type hair towels for years now. They do the job, sort of, I mean they are better than trying to balance a giant bath towel on your head, but they really do not absorb much. I am speaking from the perspective of a person with short fine hair too! I just had become accustomed to these dollar store hair towels and never really thought about finding another option! Too bad for me as I have been seriously missing out! As soon as I got the Luxe Beauty Essentials Plush Microfiber Hair Towel in the mail I ran and grabbed my old one to compare, so my hair was dry when I first tried them both side by side, or head by head, or whatever ... I instantly tossed that cheap dollar store hair towel in the trash! I LOVE this plush towel!&lt;br /&gt;I got this free for review but I kid you not, I am IN LOVE!&lt;br /&gt;nyway, so I showered tonight, yes it happens, and I put it on my head as I did my regular after shower routine, clean the ears, face serum, moisturizer, skin cream, hair protectant, (this is about the time I would normally have to take my dollar store towel off as it would be soaked, and my hair would still be wet), what did I do next ... anyway you get the idea, I did my stuffs and then realized, my towel was not only dry, still firmly attached to my head, even though there is no button and elastic loop to put the button through, and most of all DRY! (run on sentence city there)...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took the towel off and my hair, it was not dry but it was moist, at most. It was like the towel magically sucked the water from my hair! The towel was somewhat damp, but not soaked. I hung it up with a smile and look forward to using it again and I totally want some bath towels made of this stuff! I have to ask Beauty by Shea if they make them, and if not encourage them to do so!</li>
            <li> My daughter has beautiful, very long, thick blonde hair. It takes her forever to  dry it. Drying her hair with the Luxe Beauty Essentials microfiber hair towel then using a hair dryer has cut her drying time down considerably (it takes about 35 minutes to dry). In the past it took her 45 minutes to dry her hair (first she used a bath towel, then hair dryer).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Instructions for claiming a free microfiber face cloth are provided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;19\\&quot; x 39\\&quot; microfiber towel&lt;br /&gt;80% polyester &amp; 20% polyamide&lt;br /&gt;machine wash warm, tumble dry&lt;br /&gt;do not bleach&lt;br /&gt;do not use fabric softener&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;review sample provided</li>
            <li> This towel is amazing. It&#x27;s big enough to tie up my bra length hair and my curls are popping after I take this off, no frizz.  It dries your hair pretty quickly and has cut down on my air drying time significantly.</li>
            <li> Finally discovered a microfiber hair towel that is designed for thick, longer hair types. For years I have wanted to try these as I know others who use these exclusively because they love them so much but every single one I found was tiny and more of a cap or turban. By contrast this is huge and easily covered all of my hair. It&#x27;s so plush and soft feeling yet lightweight unlike many towels of a similar feel which have caused headaches from the weight of the towel itself combined with the water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of water yes these are a lifesaver and I can now see why everyone loves these so much. No more rushing out the door with wet hair. These helped cut down the dry time significantly without the need for damaging heat and even better, it didn&#x27;t rough up the hair&#x27;s cuticle or contribute to static frizz. Curly girls know the evils of this and how many hair professionals recommend using anything but a bath towel, including paper napkins, to dry your hair. I don&#x27;t have time for that personally and it always felt unsettlingly wasteful. Now with this microfiber towel by the time my skincare and makeup is done my hair is dry too leading this to being the only towel I now use on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely going to order some more as gifts!
