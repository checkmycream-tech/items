            <li>love ardell lashes.</li>
            <li>I thought I would like these better because they are thicker than the 110&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>These are Just like the ones I buy in the store but the bulk price is much better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried rolling them around my finger or a makeup brush to get more curve in the inside edge.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve trimmed them to make sure they fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>finally, finally, one day I got them to stick and had applied them so nearly perfectly</li>
            <li>Wish I could figure out how to reuse them more.</li>
            <li>Maybe I should&#x27;ve looked at the photo better but the product title says &amp;#34;Ardell Fashion Lashes Pair - 109</li>
            <li>I started one with buying the Ardell 110 lashes and LOVE those.</li>
            <li>They are very light and easy to put on.</li>
            <li>Versatile and easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>These lashes are perfect, they look so natural &amp; real.</li>
            <li>Easy to trim if need be.</li>
            <li>Light weight, easy to apply and take off.</li>
            <li>These lashes go on easy and are perfect for a day look or night out on the town when you want to have a little fun!</li>
            <li>The lashes really are pretty gorgeous.  </li>
            <li>I use these 109&#x27;s when going for a bolder, more noticeable look, and #110 when I want a more natural approach.  </li>
            <li>Trim the ends if they&#x27;re too long and dbl ply then on the outside for a more drastic look, great for evening!</li>
            <li>These are full width lashes.</li>
            <li>Great price, arrived quick, and as expected</li>
            <li>Its good for those who wants natural lashes but has that pizzazz feel as well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with Kiss &amp;#34;Shy&amp;#34; lashes, but couldn&#x27;t find them in New York City or online.</li>
            <li>I proceeded to tidy my vanity, and five minutes later I glanced at the mirror.  </li>
            <li>The price is right for 4 pair.  </li>
            <li>I like 109s because they aren&#x27;t too dramatic, which is perfect because I wear lighter makeup.</li>
            <li>The Kiss lashes feel very natural and are easy to wear.</li>
            <li>I do not like my lashes to be visibily fake and these are great to add to my lashes to create a bit more lash effect.</li>
            <li>The picture is exactly how the lashes looked when I got them.</li>
            <li>I love the price, only wear them once and then toss them!</li>
            <li>These are my 2nd favorite lashes by Ardell.  </li>
            <li>but like other consumers the 110&#x27;s look more natural and are my favorite.  </li>
            <li>got this length so they can look natural and full beatiful lashes.</li>
            <li>With gentle care (follow the instructions)</li>
            <li>I really like the look</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve determined one or both of the following is true:  </li>
            <li>I have used and abused mine over and over before needing a new pair.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Other than that, the lashes themselves are great because the band is thin enough to mold to the shape of your eye.</li>
            <li>These look very natural.</li>
            <li>Ardell lashes were the first I have ever tried and there is no reason for me to ever try a different brand.  </li>
            <li>They are so natural people can&#x27;t tell I have them on!</li>
            <li>But they looked so natural!</li>
            <li>They fill out your natural lashes without looking too fake.&lt;br</li>
            <li>You do need a stronger adhesive like Duo eyelash adhesive since the lashes don&#x27;t naturally cling to the arch of your eyelid.  </li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>For longer natural looking lashes, these are my go to.  </li>
            <li>My friend recommended these lashes to me and they look so natural.</li>
            <li>You can reuse them for a few days or more with proper care.  </li>
            <li>I wanted something a little more dramatic but not over the top.</li>
            <li>I did have to trim them down but it was easy enough.</li>
            <li>They are the most natural looking for anyone who isn&#x27;t yet used to wearing false lashes.  </li>
            <li>I would give Ardell lashes a thumbs up, these lashes look so natural looking but give you that extra definition in your eyes.  </li>
            <li>The lashes are not so full that they look heavy, but I wouldn&#x27;t call them \\&quot;demi\\&quot; as those are usually smaller.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re worried about them being too long to be natural, STOP WORRYING!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> love ardell lashes. got this length so they can look natural and full beatiful lashes. stays its shape after several applications.</li>
            <li> Love these!!! If you&#x27;re worried about them being too long to be natural, STOP WORRYING! Once you curl them, they look gorgeous. These are my slightly longer falsies. The second style I&#x27;ve decided to stock up on.</li>
            <li> The picture is exactly how the lashes looked when I got them. This was for my niece- she loved it.</li>
            <li> Light weight, easy to apply and take off. You hardly notice they&#x27;re on! They fill out your natural lashes without looking too fake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You do have to purchase eyelash glue separately. These do not come with any sort of application material, they are just the lashes.</li>
            <li> Versatile and easy to apply.  You do need a stronger adhesive like Duo eyelash adhesive since the lashes don&#x27;t naturally cling to the arch of your eyelid.  You can&#x27;t beat the price.  I thought I would like these better because they are thicker than the 110&#x27;s. but like other consumers the 110&#x27;s look more natural and are my favorite.  Still, the 109&#x27;s come in a close second.</li>
            <li> Very light eyelashes and good quality. I could use them every day if I had the time to put them on!</li>
            <li> These are Just like the ones I buy in the store but the bulk price is much better. Will def. order again!</li>
            <li> I use these 109&#x27;s when going for a bolder, more noticeable look, and #110 when I want a more natural approach.  Ardell lashes were the first I have ever tried and there is no reason for me to ever try a different brand.  With gentle care (follow the instructions) I have used and abused mine over and over before needing a new pair.  I also wear contact lenses and never had a problem with them.  They give my eyes that extra-sexy OOMPH!</li>
            <li> what a great deal!!! These lashes go on easy and are perfect for a day look or night out on the town when you want to have a little fun! I love the price, only wear them once and then toss them!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with Kiss &amp;#34;Shy&amp;#34; lashes, but couldn&#x27;t find them in New York City or online. I tried these based on the reviews and they were very stiff, plastic feeling and generally uncomfortable. The Kiss lashes feel very natural and are easy to wear. These were not a good replacement.</li>
            <li> These lashes are beautiful.  You can reuse them for a few days or more with proper care.  The price is right for 4 pair.  They are not cheap or flimsy.  They wear well.</li>
            <li> These are the best beginner lashes I&#x27;ve used!  They are the most natural looking for anyone who isn&#x27;t yet used to wearing false lashes.  I&#x27;ll wear them for daytime and at work if I don&#x27;t feel like wearing any eye makeup.  My only advice is that if you&#x27;re just beginning to try falsies, it helps to have a thin line of eyeliner to use as a guideline at first.  I&#x27;ve been wearing them for years, so I&#x27;ve mastered putting them on perfectly in record time.</li>
            <li> Its good for those who wants natural lashes but has that pizzazz feel as well. Not too dramatic. It&#x27;ll be good for starters and every day look.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn out two pair of these lashes just trying to get them on properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read web pages, watched videos, and tried dozens of times to get them on, and get them to stay.  I&#x27;ve tried rolling them around my finger or a makeup brush to get more curve in the inside edge.  I&#x27;ve trimmed them to make sure they fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They will not stay on.  After loads of practice, because I hadn&#x27;t used falsies before, I finally got them to stick.  I had the typical problem:  They wouldn&#x27;t stay put in the corners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But finally, finally, one day I got them to stick and had applied them so nearly perfectly I don&#x27;t believe anyone would notice they&#x27;re not my eyelashes.  They looked marvelous. The lashes really are pretty gorgeous.  I proceeded to tidy my vanity, and five minutes later I glanced at the mirror.  They were coming off.  I looked like Carol Burnett doing Gloria Swanson in Sunset Boulevard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that&#x27;s the day I threw in the towel.  I&#x27;ve determined one or both of the following is true:  I lack the skills necessary to apply false eyelashes, or my eyelids are too round for these lashes.  I won&#x27;t be buying them again.  I may try another brand.</li>
            <li> Bought for costume, like all false eyelashes, too much work to wear daily.</li>
            <li> My wife loved the product</li>
            <li> The lashes are not so full that they look heavy, but I wouldn&#x27;t call them \\&quot;demi\\&quot; as those are usually smaller.  These are full width lashes.</li>
            <li> Wow. These eyelashes make quite the difference for a night out. I did have to trim them down but it was easy enough. They stayed on fairly well and could be re-used. My only issue was the adjustment period- took a while to get used to the feeling of having something glued onto my eyelids.</li>
            <li> They are wonderful when I have a full face of makeup, it&#x27;s a nice addition to my look. They are so natural people can&#x27;t tell I have them on!</li>
            <li> These eyelashes are a great length and make your eyelashes look full! As a dancer, I have to wear false eyelashes for performances. 109&#x27;s were recommended to me and I would recommend them to others!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually buy strip lashes. I buy The Ardell half lashes. But they looked so natural! But I would buy again at some point.</li>
            <li> These lashes are perfect, they look so natural &amp; real. They are very light and easy to put on. I loves them</li>
            <li> I would give Ardell lashes a thumbs up, these lashes look so natural looking but give you that extra definition in your eyes.  I really like the look it gives my eyes.  I would definitely recommend ordering these lashes!</li>
            <li> Great price, arrived quick, and as expected</li>
            <li> These are my 2nd favorite lashes by Ardell.  I do not like my lashes to be visibily fake and these are great to add to my lashes to create a bit more lash effect.</li>
            <li> No natural lashes after chemo. These look very natural. Only problem is that I can only reuse them about 3 times then have to throw them away. Wish I could figure out how to reuse them more.</li>
            <li> For longer natural looking lashes, these are my go to.  Great quality.</li>
            <li> Amazing price for these! Good quality. Easy to trim if need be.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love these lashes! They are cheaper to buy online in packs, compared to buying it from the stores.  My friend recommended these lashes to me and they look so natural.</li>
            <li> Uh. I&#x27;m confused. Maybe I should&#x27;ve looked at the photo better but the product title says &amp;#34;Ardell Fashion Lashes Pair - 109 Demi (Pack of 4)&amp;#34;. I received the regular 109s and not 109 demi. I&#x27;m giving it two stars because the eyelashes are still usable (just have to trim them) but the inconsistency between the photo and product name is a misrepresentation and inconvenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, the lashes themselves are great because the band is thin enough to mold to the shape of your eye. I like 109s because they aren&#x27;t too dramatic, which is perfect because I wear lighter makeup. If you prefer a heavier, Vegas look, I suggest 101s (which I also have).</li>
            <li> Trim the ends if they&#x27;re too long and dbl ply then on the outside for a more drastic look, great for evening!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE Ardell lashes! I started one with buying the Ardell 110 lashes and LOVE those. I wanted something a little more dramatic but not over the top. These are perfect! I do not wear lashes too often so I know this 4 pack is going to last me a long while. Will purchase these again when I run out!</li>
