            <li>The product comes in this lab kind bottle without outer box.</li>

            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
            <li>Ratings were outstanding which is why I purchased.</li>
            <li>Felt there would be better results.</li>

            <li>I love this product and plan to start using it twice a day.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed both, but after some health scares, I realized it was time to quit both.</li>
            <li>Love the way the serum feels on my skin</li>

            <li>This one is pretty good in comparison.</li>
            <li>so far so good, love it!</li>
            <li>Applying the serum before my moisturizer helps my moisturizer soak in to my skin more easily and keep it hydrated through out the day.  </li>
            <li>I got the product very quickly as well.</li>
            <li>it feels good with high quality.</li>
            <li>I saw a reduction of fine lines in my forehead.</li>
            <li>The chance was fine been used blossomed.</li>
            <li>Face looked better with the first use!</li>
            <li>and it goes on smooth.  </li>
            <li>Thank u for cheap price.</li>
            <li>: I was provided with a free or discounted product in order to review this item.</li>
            <li>the lines are filled in, using this and the LaBelleza Hyaluronic Acid.</li>
            <li>We will continue to be available if the opportunity.</li>
            <li>Product, made my skin feel so smooth and yourhful.</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t say enough good things about it!!</li>
            <li>I pulled down my review mirror to just do a quick lip and brow makeup and noticed that my pores looked amazing !!!</li>
            <li>My skin has never felt so moisturized and fresh, and people can&#x27;t stop staring at me, asking me if I have been on holiday, I look so refreshed and glowing!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so excited to see how my face will continue to respond to this product.</li>
            <li>I first heard about this product from my favorite youtuber makeupd0ll.</li>
            <li>I did receive this product for the purpose of testing and sharing my honest opinion, I will be buying a second jar when is gone, I truly love it.</li>
            <li>I am thus using it only on my neck, where I am seeing good results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I came across this product as it has really worked.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be buying some more very soon.  </li>
            <li>But of course any Mom or Grand Mom with kids around will really like this feature.  </li>
            <li>Absorb quickly and don&#x27;t feel greasy.</li>
            <li>Also, it seems to blend in quickly.</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;m getting older I want to take better care of my body and fight the signs of aging.</li>
            <li>Try to apply it as quickly as you can after getting the product in your hand.  </li>
            <li>I live in Arizona, where the sun is always shining and since I love to ride horses I am out in the sun all the time.</li>
            <li>The serum has a dropper in the bottle to easily control how much serum you and going to use</li>
            <li>It goes on easy and soaks in fast, doesn&#x27;t leave my skin greasy or tacky and I can put it on under makeup.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have used a variety of Vitamin C Serums in the past and love how they are so good for my skin.</li>
            <li>Certainly plumps out my fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li>Thanks La Belleza !!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li>A fantastic product, I am not exactly a beauty buff but have used a fair share of beauty products and by far I found this one to be the most effective one, individual results will differ i guess</li>
            <li>I had so many compliments from friends and complete strangers after just using it a couple of times.</li>
            <li>I was given the opportunity to test this product out complimentary and share my experiences and feedback.</li>
            <li>La Belleza is a comprehensive skincare and anti aging formula for powerful results against all signs of aging.&lt;br /&gt;Its</li>
            <li>and I have to tell you the honest truth I&#x27;ve only been using it once a day in the mornings</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting far more breakouts and my skin just doesn&#x27;t have that glow that it used to.</li>
            <li>received complimentary sample for review purposes.</li>
            <li>I promise once you place this product right here</li>
            <li>For me, it&#x27;s a small price to pay for a great product.</li>
            <li>I started to see skin improvement within the first couple days.</li>
            <li>When I first started using this I see improvement.</li>
            <li>It has a light citrus smell that makes me feel like I&#x27;m putting a dose of &amp;#34;healthy&amp;#34; directly on my face.  </li>
            <li>The back of my hands seem to have a lot more wrinkles than I would like at age 34.</li>
            <li>I thought that she was pretty earnest and decided to give this a try.</li>
            <li>I now wear sunscreen daily, but I wanted to do more to repair my skin.</li>
            <li>recommend this product whether you&#x27;re trying to heal damage or prevent it in the first place.</li>
            <li>my skin just feels better overall.</li>
            <li>I loved the way my skin felt after using this serum for a few weeks, and of course I am continuing to use it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be honest and admit that I&#x27;m not consistent with regimens</li>
            <li>My friends and family are asking what I am using and I simply tell them about your product, which is reasonably priced and most of all works wonders.</li>
            <li>First of all, the package is very unprofessional.</li>
            <li>They all liked the convenient size and the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have the harsh smell many similar products have.  </li>
            <li>It has no funny smell, goes on easily, and it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>I have had a large pore on my cheek forever and it shrinked so much.</li>
            <li>Considering that I&#x27;m probably a good decade plus if not more older than she is</li>
            <li>Just seems so fast absorbing and really works.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>Even though the product is in a brown glass bottle you can still see how much of the product is inside</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not using too much at one time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like this.</li>
            <li>I will update my review once I start seeing the real results.</li>
            <li>It rather dries up fast and and you do not feel like you have anything on your face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Fast delivery, can&#x27;t wait to use it.</li>
            <li>but I haven&#x27;t seen any real results.</li>
            <li>Very lightweight serum, gentle and</li>
            <li>Anyways I really like it.</li>
            <li>bottle comes with a pump cover which makes it very very easy to apply the product without any mess.</li>
            <li>My dark spots are fading, my face is smooth and my skin is just overall healthy.</li>
            <li>but I found it a bit watery and had to use more than my other brand.</li>
            <li>As I&#x27;ve gotten older my skin is really taking me thru come changes.</li>
            <li>But after using this for a few weeks, I noticed that my overall complexion was more even and smooth besides just softer.  </li>
            <li>I had one particular mark on my face from a pimple that I picked to death.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend trying this product.</li>
            <li>It is highly recommended.</li>
            <li>This serum has really help to achieve glowing skin, and not only that I have noticed my discolorations to be very much improved.</li>
            <li>I have bought multiple products from this company and they always seem to get it right.  </li>
            <li>But as i live in Florida, sun protection is an issue.</li>
            <li>and it goes on easily and isn&#x27;t heavy or greasy feeling.  </li>
            <li>I should take care of my skin more, but it&#x27;s hard.</li>
            <li>I should take care of my skin more, but it&#x27;s hard.  </li>
            <li>I been using this product for about a month so far</li>
            <li>I really like this product and it appears to have several uses.  </li>
            <li>my skin become soft and animated.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>So far seems to be improving skin a bit.</li>
            <li>I am going to say that nothing has happened with this product so far and</li>
            <li>Just bought it, just trying to see if it will work with my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It has a very watery consistency with a cloudy white color.</li>
            <li>Update: minimal improvement but not worth using - there are better products for me..</li>
            <li>Just tried this serum last last for the first time.</li>
            <li>You guys definitely have a new fan.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is the child-proof top...</li>
            <li>This serum isn&#x27;t thick and it is absorbed by the skin fast unlike some serums I have used.</li>
            <li>I recently had several dry patches on my face and clear it right up overnight.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m making a major effort to repair the skin with the serum.  </li>
            <li>I live in a very dry and cold climate, and it is good to have a high quality product to use on the neck and jawline area, especially in the winter.</li>
            <li>I generally don&#x27;t like anything with any scent.  </li>
            <li>ain&#x27;t leaving for as long as I live.</li>
            <li>It does dry quickly and will dry into your hands if you hold it for too long.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this daily for a month now and seen a major difference in my skin.</li>

            <li> so far so good, love it!</li>
            <li> Applying the serum before my moisturizer helps my moisturizer soak in to my skin more easily and keep it hydrated through out the day.  </li>
            <li> I got the product very quickly as well.</li>
            <li> it feels good with high quality.</li>

            <li> the lines are filled in, using this and the LaBelleza Hyaluronic Acid.</li>
            <li> We will continue to be available if the opportunity.</li>
            <li> Product, made my skin feel so smooth and yourhful.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t say enough good things about it!!</li>
            <li> I pulled down my review mirror to just do a quick lip and brow makeup and noticed that my pores looked amazing !!!</li>
            <li> My skin has never felt so moisturized and fresh, and people can&#x27;t stop staring at me, asking me if I have been on holiday, I look so refreshed and glowing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so excited to see how my face will continue to respond to this product.</li>
            <li> I first heard about this product from my favorite youtuber makeupd0ll.</li>
            <li> I did receive this product for the purpose of testing and sharing my honest opinion, I will be buying a second jar when is gone, I truly love it.</li>
            <li> I am thus using it only on my neck, where I am seeing good results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I came across this product as it has really worked.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be buying some more very soon.  </li>
            <li> But of course any Mom or Grand Mom with kids around will really like this feature.  </li>
            <li> Absorb quickly and don&#x27;t feel greasy.</li>
            <li> Also, it seems to blend in quickly.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;m getting older I want to take better care of my body and fight the signs of aging.</li>
            <li> Try to apply it as quickly as you can after getting the product in your hand.  </li>
            <li> I live in Arizona, where the sun is always shining and since I love to ride horses I am out in the sun all the time.</li>
            <li> The serum has a dropper in the bottle to easily control how much serum you and going to use</li>
            <li> It goes on easy and soaks in fast, doesn&#x27;t leave my skin greasy or tacky and I can put it on under makeup.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have used a variety of Vitamin C Serums in the past and love how they are so good for my skin.</li>
            <li> Certainly plumps out my fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li> Thanks La Belleza !!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> A fantastic product, I am not exactly a beauty buff but have used a fair share of beauty products and by far I found this one to be the most effective one, individual results will differ i guess</li>
            <li> I had so many compliments from friends and complete strangers after just using it a couple of times.</li>
            <li> I was given the opportunity to test this product out complimentary and share my experiences and feedback.</li>
            <li> La Belleza is a comprehensive skincare and anti aging formula for powerful results against all signs of aging.&lt;br /&gt;Its</li>
            <li> and I have to tell you the honest truth I&#x27;ve only been using it once a day in the mornings</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting far more breakouts and my skin just doesn&#x27;t have that glow that it used to.</li>
            <li> received complimentary sample for review purposes.</li>
            <li> I promise once you place this product right here</li>
            <li> For me, it&#x27;s a small price to pay for a great product.</li>
            <li> I started to see skin improvement within the first couple days.</li>
            <li> When I first started using this I see improvement.</li>
            <li> It has a light citrus smell that makes me feel like I&#x27;m putting a dose of &amp;#34;healthy&amp;#34; directly on my face.  </li>
            <li> The back of my hands seem to have a lot more wrinkles than I would like at age 34.</li>
            <li> I thought that she was pretty earnest and decided to give this a try.</li>
            <li> I now wear sunscreen daily, but I wanted to do more to repair my skin.</li>
            <li> recommend this product whether you&#x27;re trying to heal damage or prevent it in the first place.</li>
            <li> my skin just feels better overall.</li>
            <li> I loved the way my skin felt after using this serum for a few weeks, and of course I am continuing to use it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be honest and admit that I&#x27;m not consistent with regimens</li>
            <li> My friends and family are asking what I am using and I simply tell them about your product, which is reasonably priced and most of all works wonders.</li>
            <li> First of all, the package is very unprofessional.</li>
            <li> They all liked the convenient size and the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have the harsh smell many similar products have.  </li>
            <li> It has no funny smell, goes on easily, and it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> I have had a large pore on my cheek forever and it shrinked so much.</li>
            <li> Considering that I&#x27;m probably a good decade plus if not more older than she is</li>
            <li> Just seems so fast absorbing and really works.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> Even though the product is in a brown glass bottle you can still see how much of the product is inside</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not using too much at one time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like this.</li>
            <li> I will update my review once I start seeing the real results.</li>
            <li> It rather dries up fast and and you do not feel like you have anything on your face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, can&#x27;t wait to use it.</li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t seen any real results.</li>
            <li> Very lightweight serum, gentle and</li>
            <li> Anyways I really like it.</li>
            <li> bottle comes with a pump cover which makes it very very easy to apply the product without any mess.</li>
            <li> My dark spots are fading, my face is smooth and my skin is just overall healthy.</li>
            <li> but I found it a bit watery and had to use more than my other brand.</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve gotten older my skin is really taking me thru come changes.</li>
            <li> But after using this for a few weeks, I noticed that my overall complexion was more even and smooth besides just softer.  </li>
            <li> I had one particular mark on my face from a pimple that I picked to death.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend trying this product.</li>
            <li> It is highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This serum has really help to achieve glowing skin, and not only that I have noticed my discolorations to be very much improved.</li>
            <li> I have bought multiple products from this company and they always seem to get it right.  </li>
            <li> But as i live in Florida, sun protection is an issue.</li>
            <li> and it goes on easily and isn&#x27;t heavy or greasy feeling.  </li>
            <li> I should take care of my skin more, but it&#x27;s hard.</li>
            <li> I should take care of my skin more, but it&#x27;s hard.  </li>
            <li> I been using this product for about a month so far</li>
            <li> I really like this product and it appears to have several uses.  </li>
            <li> my skin become soft and animated.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> So far seems to be improving skin a bit.</li>
            <li> I am going to say that nothing has happened with this product so far and</li>
            <li> Just bought it, just trying to see if it will work with my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It has a very watery consistency with a cloudy white color.</li>
            <li> Update: minimal improvement but not worth using - there are better products for me..</li>
            <li> Just tried this serum last last for the first time.</li>
            <li> You guys definitely have a new fan.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the child-proof top...</li>
            <li> This serum isn&#x27;t thick and it is absorbed by the skin fast unlike some serums I have used.</li>
            <li> I recently had several dry patches on my face and clear it right up overnight.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m making a major effort to repair the skin with the serum.  </li>
            <li> I live in a very dry and cold climate, and it is good to have a high quality product to use on the neck and jawline area, especially in the winter.</li>
            <li> I generally don&#x27;t like anything with any scent.  </li>
            <li> ain&#x27;t leaving for as long as I live.</li>
            <li> It does dry quickly and will dry into your hands if you hold it for too long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this daily for a month now and seen a major difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> The area was dark, dull and visibly raised from the damage that I caused for the past few weeks, Within five days of using this product my skin around that area in particular has responded nicely.</li>
            <li> When i looked in the mirror I got the constant reminder that I just turned 40, but after using your produce for a few weeks I can see it is working hard to restore my skin to look younger and fresh!</li>
            <li> It may be only 2 oz, but it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> When I first started using this, I was skeptical because there are so many skin care products out there, but after a few days, I felt my skin getting a little softer.  </li>
            <li> The  bottle is 2 oz., it will last a very long time.  </li>
            <li> And I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin which tends to get dry spots by the middle of the day (by my temple area, hasn&#x27;t been since I&#x27;ve used this).   </li>
            <li> So far, after a few short weeks, I have noticed some differences in the quality of my skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a thin, lightweight serum that absorbs quickly into my skin.  </li>
            <li> I have very dry skin especially my forehead, and I had a promotional opportunity</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to see the long term advantages of the La Belleza Skincare Vitamin C Serum for Face and Body!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure</li>
            <li> The package came in the mail faster than expected and the bottle was well labeled plus it was larger than I though it would be.</li>
            <li> I generally use about half a dropper each application.</li>
            <li> This made my acne worse, particularly the cystic acne on my chin, even though I only used a tiny amount.</li>
            <li> It also has a very strange smell, like a burnt oder.  </li>
            <li> Erma dry skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Secondly, my skin felt dry after applied the VC liquid.</li>
            <li> To use all I do is cleanse my face and pat it dry.</li>
            <li> It seems to me the product is in its trial stage or very limited production.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Since our hands often tell our age, I also rub a little into the back of my hands.  </li>
            <li> I like that it is organic, since I&#x27;m careful about what I put on my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for a few days (in the morning)</li>
            <li> This product has helped over the last few weeks, and I plan to continue using it.</li>
            <li> However, this is something I&#x27;ve noticed with other serums.  </li>
            <li> I have to agree with other reviews.  </li>
            <li> While I have tried other Vitamin C serums....</li>
            <li> My only complaint is with the cap.</li>
            <li> The serum has truly helped with fading dark spots and helping to add a youthful glow to my face.</li>
            <li> MY WRINKLES ARE GETTING LESS PRONOUNCED.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it for about 1 and a half months.</li>
            <li> I have been using the serum a little over a week.  </li>
            <li> When it&#x27;s humid, my face feels a little sticky if I don&#x27;t use a moisturizer over the serum.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, it came in a little brown glass bottle with dropper.</li>
            <li> I found this little gem in a health food shop and decided I&#x27;d give it a try.</li>
            <li> (I guess she thought I needed a little skin care help,,lol)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if mine was damaged, but I have had a lot of trouble getting the cap on and off.</li>
            <li> Uneven skin</li>
            <li> After just a few days, I noticed a difference in my skin texture.  </li>
            <li> I have to waste some of the product because it won&#x27;t all come out.</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money.</li>
            <li> i can see a definite improvement especially round my eyes and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had other Vitamin C serums and one in particular had a unpleasant scent.  </li>
            <li> But the other morning I was doing my routine and woke up a little to late to do my makeup before dropping the kids to school.</li>
            <li> you just need to use a little bit!  </li>
            <li> There is very little scent if any</li>
            <li> , I can not see any changes in my skin -- not better or worse.&lt;br</li>
            <li> was just to lazy to do it at night.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also winter, and my skin and nails have been drier than usual.</li>
            <li> It has brighten my skin and it has slowly lighten my acne scars.</li>
            <li> The label is poorly designed.</li>
            <li> They all say it smells weird, and not noticing any improvement.</li>
            <li> This is a real thin serum.</li>
            <li> Worst product I have ever bought.  </li>

            <li> I love the way this stuff makes my skin look.</li>
            <li> I have been using the serum a little over a week.  My skin in softer and smoother.  There is very little scent if any and it goes on smooth.  Great product!</li>
            <li> Used all over my face during the day under my moisturizer and broke me out. Put on at night as a spot treatment wonderful results.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product it has my skin looking beautiful</li>
            <li> I started using this vitamin c serum after I saw a review from one of my favorite vloggers named makeup doll. I been using this product for about a month so far and I am loving the results. This serum has really help to achieve glowing skin, and not only that I have noticed my discolorations to be very much improved. This product had become a very regular part of my skin care regimen. This serum is truly a MUST HAVE! I love it. This serum isn&#x27;t thick and it is absorbed by the skin fast unlike some serums I have used. Thank you la belleza for a great skin care product, and thank you makeup doll for recommending this product.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:be2487f22ce343a35c9d489bfc5ff667]] This is my review on the Vitamin C serum from La Belleza, I am getting great results and do recommend it. I did receive this product for the purpose of testing and sharing my honest opinion, I will be buying a second jar when is gone, I truly love it.</li>
            <li> Thank u for cheap price. good qualty</li>
            <li> I really like this product. I use it in the evening, once per day and I have noticed that my skin looks and feels healthier. I love that this is an organic product. My only complaint is with the cap. I don&#x27;t know if mine was damaged, but I have had a lot of trouble getting the cap on and off. I ended up putting a dropper cap from another bottle onto this bottle and that solved the problem.</li>
            <li> I have tried many anti-aging serums and creams, and none has worked to restore my skin like this one! I had so many compliments from friends and complete strangers after just using it a couple of times. My skin has never felt so moisturized and fresh, and people can&#x27;t stop staring at me, asking me if I have been on holiday, I look so refreshed and glowing! I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it!! I can&#x27;t stop smiling!</li>
            <li> I recently received La Belleza Skincare Vitamin C for the purpose of this review.  This is my opinion alone.  Even though the product is in a brown glass bottle you can still see how much of the product is inside so you&#x27;ll know when to reorder.  I like this.  I also like that it comes with a dropper so I&#x27;m not using too much at one time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum contains vitamin C to help repair your skin and keep it from aging.  Applying the serum before my moisturizer helps my moisturizer soak in to my skin more easily and keep it hydrated through out the day.  Just a drop or two of this spreads well on my face and under my eyes, this is a thinner consistency.  I have been using this for about two weeks now and have about 2/3 of the bottle left and have used it each morning and evening.  I really like this.</li>
            <li> very good price. and good quility.</li>
            <li> nice alternative to the Obaji  ..  great price</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:c946784ccc26e9969bfee41b71c9372]] Get Youthful Glowing Flawless Skin using La belleza Vitamin C Serum!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! I started to see skin improvement within the first couple days.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very light and easy to absorb.</li>
            <li> When i looked in the mirror I got the constant reminder that I just turned 40, but after using your produce for a few weeks I can see it is working hard to restore my skin to look younger and fresh! My friends and family are asking what I am using and I simply tell them about your product, which is reasonably priced and most of all works wonders. I really can&#x27;t say enough good things about it!! Buy this product now and you will never look back</li>
            <li> Love this product. I use it instead of regular lotion in the winter. Don&#x27;t feel any dryness. Absorb quickly and don&#x27;t feel greasy. My skin looks younger after using it.</li>
            <li> The incredible to good quality at a reasonable price&lt;br /&gt;After purchase, I&#x27;m too happy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m exposed to the sunshine a lot, traveling car I have a lot of sun damage. I should take care of my skin more, but it&#x27;s hard. When I first started using this I see improvement.</li>
            <li> The La Belleza Skincare Vitamin C Serum for Face and Body smells fabulous!  It has a light citrus smell that makes me feel like I&#x27;m putting a dose of &amp;#34;healthy&amp;#34; directly on my face.  It&#x27;s a thin, lightweight serum that absorbs quickly into my skin.  When it&#x27;s humid, my face feels a little sticky if I don&#x27;t use a moisturizer over the serum.  However, this is something I&#x27;ve noticed with other serums.  In recent pictures, I&#x27;ve noticed sun damage to the skin on my chest.  I&#x27;m making a major effort to repair the skin with the serum.  Since our hands often tell our age, I also rub a little into the back of my hands.  Can&#x27;t wait to see the long term advantages of the La Belleza Skincare Vitamin C Serum for Face and Body!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I was provided with a free or discounted product in order to review this item. However, this did not influence my review. All opinions are true and my own.</li>
            <li> It has helped my scars n my skin tone in my face amazingly thumbs up.</li>
            <li> I have tried a ton of the vitamin C serums on the market. This one is pretty good in comparison. The smell is pleasant and it does leave a film on your face. It is a bit watery though. I have bought multiple products from this company and they always seem to get it right.  ** received for review and inspection purposes **</li>
            <li> This made my acne worse, particularly the cystic acne on my chin, even though I only used a tiny amount. I am thus using it only on my neck, where I am seeing good results. I live in a very dry and cold climate, and it is good to have a high quality product to use on the neck and jawline area, especially in the winter. The skin on my neck has improved in tone and appearance.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!!  I USE IT AT NIGHT AND IN THE MORNING.  I FEEL LIKE MY WRINKLES ARE GETTING LESS PRONOUNCED.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this!!! I couldn&#x27;t be happier!! Thank you!!</li>
            <li> This was the perfect gift ideal.  I bought some for three of my favorite mother&#x27;s this Christmas and all of them have had nothing but good things to say about it.  They all liked the convenient size and the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have the harsh smell many similar products have.  All three ladies said they wanted the link so they could continue to purchase it on their own.  Thank you</li>
            <li> I just got this yeseles.promise all I can say from one night is I&#x27;m in love and I&#x27;m never leaving belleza and belleza ain&#x27;t leaving for as long as I live. PEOPLE IF U HAVE SKIN PROblem acne, hyperpi mentality Uneven skin Erma dry skin. Ect. I promise once you place this product right here o. Your face , you Won&#x27;t try anything eles.p</li>
            <li> I saw a reduction of fine lines in my forehead. I feel awesome! I was so worried that nothing I could do would fix the issue and this product worked it&#x27;s magic.</li>
            <li> I have to agree with other reviews.  I love this!</li>
            <li> I am starting to notice a bit of difference in my skin since I have been using La Belleza vitamin C.  I have only been using it for a couple of weeks, but am hoping that I will really start seeing the improvements in the next few weeks. I will update my review once I start seeing the real results.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a product to help me with my skin issues. I&#x27;m glad I came across this product as it has really worked. I saw great results within a week. I got the product very quickly as well. I would definitely suggest this product.</li>
            <li> This is a real thin serum. Thinner than others I&#x27;ve used and drys quicker because of that. Just seems so fast absorbing and really works. I&#x27;ve noticed a big difference when I use it. Certainly plumps out my fine lines around my eyes. And I use it on my hands alot. The back of my hands seem to have a lot more wrinkles than I would like at age 34. So I&#x27;m using this on them constantly because it plumps the lines out, makes them softer.  Anyway, it came in a little brown glass bottle with dropper. 2 oz, just as shown in picture. I was able to recieve for free for sharing my honest opinion of the product.</li>
            <li> very good, fast shipping</li>
            <li> I love it!  Face looked better with the first use!</li>
            <li> I love it. My skin looks great.Seems like the lines are filled in, using this and the LaBelleza Hyaluronic Acid. I can tell a big difference! I can even go without foundation, and my skin looks GREAT! My daughter even said she could see a difference!</li>
            <li> Thank you for an amazing deal!</li>
            <li> Love it!! Love how it makes my face feel!</li>
            <li> I love the La Velleza brand! All the products I&#x27;ve tried have been of the highest quality and feel so good on my skin. This is no exception. I have been getting compliments on how great my skin looks. This smells great and is not sticky when applied to the skin. Also, it seems to blend in quickly. Great product, thank you!</li>
            <li> I love vitamin c. I know that it is good for your skin. I apply it on my face and then apply my moisturizer. It has no funny smell, goes on easily, and it absorbs quickly. I didn&#x27;t  seem to stay greasy on my face. I like that it is organic, since I&#x27;m careful about what I put on my face. I was given the opportunity to test this product out complimentary and share my experiences and feedback. I like this serum and I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Not greasy or oily, makes my skin feel great!</li>
            <li> Love this serum! I&#x27;ve been using this daily for a month now and seen a major difference in my skin. It has brighten my skin and it has slowly lighten my acne scars. It has also tighten my skin. I will definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> I really like this product and it appears to have several uses.  I use it on my face to reduce wrinkles and it does a good job.  My daughter has used this on her face and it has helped with acne breakouts.  I highly recommend trying this product.</li>
            <li> First of all, the package is very unprofessional. The product comes in this lab kind bottle without outer box. The label is poorly designed. It seems to me the product is in its trial stage or very limited production.&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, my skin felt dry after applied the VC liquid. You can not use it alone. It works just like skin toner. You have to put skin moisturizer over it.&lt;br /&gt;Finally, after using most of liquid (about 40 days), I can not see any changes in my skin -- not better or worse.&lt;br /&gt;Solution: I will not purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> Love this too! Very happy with this product ! And the price! Will buy again! My skin is glowing again !&lt;br /&gt;To me that&#x27;s great at 47! Thanks La Belleza !!</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin especially my forehead, and I had a promotional opportunity and I tried this Vitamin C serum.  After just a few days, I noticed a difference in my skin texture.  I didn&#x27;t think to mention it to anyone, but people kept telling me how much younger I looked and my skin looked brighter and shiny.  The serum has a dropper in the bottle to easily control how much serum you and going to use and it goes on easily and isn&#x27;t heavy or greasy feeling.  The  bottle is 2 oz., it will last a very long time.  Very glad I saw the promotion, and I honestly have to say it&#x27;s a very good serum and makes you feel like you just had a facial at a salon.</li>
            <li> A fantastic product, I am not exactly a beauty buff but have used a fair share of beauty products and by far I found this one to be the most effective one, individual results will differ i guess but I am sure everyone will like this anti-aging cream.</li>
            <li> My cousin bought me this as a gift and I absolutely LOVE it!  I&#x27;m exposed to the sunshine a lot, traveling on a sailboat so I have a lot of sun damage.  I should take care of my skin more, but it&#x27;s hard.  When I first started using this, I was skeptical because there are so many skin care products out there, but after a few days, I felt my skin getting a little softer.  But after using this for a few weeks, I noticed that my overall complexion was more even and smooth besides just softer.  So far, after a few short weeks, I have noticed some differences in the quality of my skin.  Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Great. It is highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not seeing any plumping, or brightening.  It also has a very strange smell, like a burnt oder.  I bought three of these for myself and daughters.  They all say it smells weird, and not noticing any improvement.</li>
            <li> Everyone knows that vitamin C is good for your immune system, but who knew it worked great for skin care as well.  This stuff is awesome.  I got this as a gift.  I&#x27;ll be buying some more very soon.  Totally recommend for anyone.</li>
            <li> Great serum for creating youthful skin.</li>
            <li> great serum. my skin become soft and animated.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product to all people who want to be against skin aging.&lt;br /&gt;thank you.</li>
            <li> I use this under my wrinkle cream,, no spring chick but I am holding my own for 50.</li>
            <li> So far seems to be improving skin a bit. Will stick with it. Minimal improvement so far. Ratings were outstanding which is why I purchased. Felt there would be better results. Will keep using and updating. Update: minimal improvement but not worth using - there are better products for me..</li>
            <li> Vitamin C serums have been gaining popularity in recent times. They work great on most of your body parts, including face, hands, feet and even make your nails healthy.&lt;br /&gt;This is an organic formula to help rejuvenate your skin, making it healthy and glow. Also works as an anti aging product which gives results relatively faster. Vitamin C repairs and regenerates skin cells. La Belleza is a comprehensive skincare and anti aging formula for powerful results against all signs of aging.&lt;br /&gt;Its not greasy and does not leave an oily look. It rather dries up fast and and you do not feel like you have anything on your face.&lt;br /&gt;This bottle comes with a pump cover which makes it very very easy to apply the product without any mess. I really liked this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reviewed by- Shazia</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 weeks and I have to tell you the honest truth I&#x27;ve only been using it once a day in the mornings was just to lazy to do it at night. But the other morning I was doing my routine and woke up a little to late to do my makeup before dropping the kids to school. I pulled down my review mirror to just do a quick lip and brow makeup and noticed that my pores looked amazing !!! I have had a large pore on my cheek forever and it shrinked so much. And my tone is starting to even out.I love this product and plan to start using it twice a day. It&#x27;s a must try</li>
            <li> I came across this product from a review by makeup blogger makeupd0ll. Considering that I&#x27;m probably a good decade plus if not more older than she is I thought that she was pretty earnest and decided to give this a try. As I&#x27;ve gotten older my skin is really taking me thru come changes. I&#x27;m getting far more breakouts and my skin just doesn&#x27;t have that glow that it used to. I&#x27;ll be honest and admit that I&#x27;m not consistent with regimens so I know that&#x27;s a big part of the problem.  I&#x27;ve only been using this for a few days (in the morning) and I can already see a difference! I had one particular mark on my face from a pimple that I picked to death. The area was dark, dull and visibly raised from the damage that I caused for the past few weeks, Within five days of using this product my skin around that area in particular has responded nicely. The darkness and inflammation has diminished noticeably and there&#x27;s now a dewiness to my skin overall. And I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin which tends to get dry spots by the middle of the day (by my temple area, hasn&#x27;t been since I&#x27;ve used this).   I have to credit it this because I haven&#x27;t changed anything else. Moving forward I will continue to use an exfoliator once or twice a week, but I will use this serum daily (followed up with a moisturizer/sunscreen). I&#x27;m so excited to see how my face will continue to respond to this product. Because if I&#x27;m only using it once I day, I can only imagine what will happen when I start using it at night as well.   You guys definitely have a new fan. I&#x27;ve already ordered my second bottle.</li>
            <li> I noticed a change in the appearance of my skin. My dark spots are fading, my face is smooth and my skin is just overall healthy.</li>
            <li> I saw a difference in my skin but the bottle dropper malfunction. It wouldn&#x27;t open up after 2 uses. I had to cut the the nipped part on the dropper and shake it out. I have to waste some of the product because it won&#x27;t all come out. Will not repurchase.</li>
            <li> Does just what it clams</li>
            <li> Once upon a time I was a smoker. And I laid out in the sun on a regular basis. I enjoyed both, but after some health scares, I realized it was time to quit both. I now wear sunscreen daily, but I wanted to do more to repair my skin. I found this little gem in a health food shop and decided I&#x27;d give it a try. It goes on easy and soaks in fast, doesn&#x27;t leave my skin greasy or tacky and I can put it on under makeup.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product whether you&#x27;re trying to heal damage or prevent it in the first place. It&#x27;s got a nice scent, too, so you don&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re applying medicine. It may be only 2 oz, but it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have just started using this it feels good with high quality.</li>
            <li> Just tried this serum last last for the first time. Love the way the serum feels on my skin and YES I noticed my skin was looking and feeling amazing this morning. I have tried so many products and I think this one is a keeper.</li>
            <li> Use nightly. Someone just told me something was different, did I lose weight, do my hair different? No to both, vitamin c with the hyaluronic acid nightly. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> The chance was fine been used blossomed. Did not yet want to continue to use both. We will continue to be available if the opportunity.</li>
            <li> I like this product, it leaves your face brighter and it evens out skin tone. Very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Nice product. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Very good product absorbs quickly will get again!</li>
            <li> I live in Arizona, where the sun is always shining and since I love to ride horses I am out in the sun all the time. Not only riding, but also when we are training and feeding too. So I needed something to help my skin with all that sunshine. This product has helped over the last few weeks, and I plan to continue using it. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, can&#x27;t wait to use it.</li>
            <li> Does nothing. Worst product I have ever bought.  Dont waste your money.</li>
            <li> The best ever love love love .good on my skin love love it</li>
            <li> Love it, I apply it with the hyaluronic acid, can see a difference in textures of sin in a week, will be reordering.</li>
            <li> I have used a variety of Vitamin C Serums in the past and love how they are so good for my skin. Since I&#x27;m getting older I want to take better care of my body and fight the signs of aging. Using Vitamin C is great to fend off any wrinkles from popping up and helps in minimizing them. To use all I do is cleanse my face and pat it dry. Then I use about 2 drops and apply to my face and neck area. It&#x27;s also winter, and my skin and nails have been drier than usual. I&#x27;ve been using it a couple of days and am seeing an improvement already. I like how the serum makes my skin feel softer and smoother. My nails aren&#x27;t as brittle and seem more nourished also. Overall I&#x27;m happy with this product and plan to use it for more great results.&lt;br /&gt;I received complimentary sample for review purposes.</li>
            <li> My favorite serums, feels great on!</li>
            <li> I first heard about this product from my favorite youtuber makeupd0ll. This is the best product I have ever used. I love how it absorbs in the skin and how it is not sticky after application. The package came in the mail faster than expected and the bottle was well labeled plus it was larger than I though it would be. I can definately see a difference in my skin my face glows looks youthful and the hyphen pigmentation seems like it is disappearing. I use it twice a day after I wash my face. This is the best product I&#x27;ve ever used!!!</li>
            <li> I really love this product.  I recently had several dry patches on my face and clear it right up overnight. I saw a big difference in my skin. Love. Got to stock up on this product.</li>
            <li> I am going to say that nothing has happened with this product so far and my skin but I put it on twice a day still hoping.It feels like something is happening but I haven&#x27;t seen any real results. I will keep trying it has only been an</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for 2 weeks now and I do see a difference! Very lightweight serum, gentle and you just need to use a little bit!  Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> Just bought it, just trying to see if it will work with my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Amazing!!! Product, made my skin feel so smooth and yourhful. I definently will be ordering more for myself and for gifts ðŸ˜Š</li>
            <li> I have to say that all the La Belleza products that I have used has made a big difference in my skin.  I am amazed at the great products that they sell</li>
            <li> The serum has truly helped with fading dark spots and helping to add a youthful glow to my face. This is not a miracle serum it&#x27;s going to take months to see results. Using this serum with a skin care routine will help achieve results</li>
            <li> I loved the way my skin felt after using this serum for a few weeks, and of course I am continuing to use it.  I&#x27;ve had other Vitamin C serums and one in particular had a unpleasant scent.  I generally don&#x27;t like anything with any scent.  This serum has no scent which is great.  My only complaint is the child-proof top... I have no kids around and find it a bit tricky to open.  But of course any Mom or Grand Mom with kids around will really like this feature.  For me, it&#x27;s a small price to pay for a great product.</li>
            <li> I love it. I was given this as a gift by a friend (I guess she thought I needed a little skin care help,,lol) But as i live in Florida, sun protection is an issue. Anyways I really like it. i can see a definite improvement especially round my eyes and my skin just feels better overall.</li>
            <li> Good price, good performance</li>
            <li> Works but I found it a bit watery and had to use more than my other brand.</li>
            <li> While I have tried other Vitamin C serums....I have to say I&#x27;ve had the best results with LaBelleza!! I got results in a short period of time and my skin radiates at 54!!! Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> Great serum, really improves the skin.</li>
            <li> great vitamin C serum for the face and getting rid of wrinkles</li>
            <li> I tried this product after watching a video by MakeupD0LL in which she talked about using the product. I have been using it for about 1 and a half months. I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin is definitely more bright and has more of a glow than before using. I use it in the morning under moisturizer and a CC. At night is use it after washing and then apply my nighttime moisturizer over. I generally use about half a dropper each application. It has a very watery consistency with a cloudy white color. Try to apply it as quickly as you can after getting the product in your hand.  It does dry quickly and will dry into your hands if you hold it for too long.</li>
