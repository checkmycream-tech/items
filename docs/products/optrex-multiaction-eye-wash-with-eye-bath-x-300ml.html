            <li>Great for cleaning eyes, removing dust and just washing out protein.</li>
            <li>Growing up in the UK, Optrex was a staple of every medicine cabinet- great for soothing tired/sore/itchy eyes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great because it leaves a protective film on the fur</li>
            <li>I was thrilled to find it online!</li>
            <li>The products I bought from Optrex are great, blood shot eyes, bright eyes and the wash are extremely effective.</li>

            <li>To remove stains from fur -- I&#x27;ve had better.</li>
            <li>So nice to see this product available on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Optrex makes a whole range of eye products, mostly eye drops which are equally good.</li>
            <li>I am familiar with the Optrex brand which I have not seen in the US.</li>
            <li>I clean my cats eyes and his eyes and face remains clean for about 3 weeks.</li>
            <li>I use this on my Persian cats to clean their eyes and remove tear stains.</li>
            <li>Keeping the eyes clean with Optrex helped them heal when used with an antibiotic.</li>
            <li>This is a good product that actually cleans and soothes the eye of all discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Just perfect as expected and just like last time.</li>
            <li>Overall nice to have some time to relax and give your eyes a break.</li>
            <li>I prefer it to the eye washes available here, so finally being able to purchase it again was a relief.</li>
            <li>Perfect for dry eyes therapy, especially for those who have sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li>This product works very well, very good  for tired eyes;which</li>
            <li>Its been around for ages and is very well known over there.  </li>

            <li>I use this product to clean the eyes on my white Persian cat.</li>
            <li>The  main ingredient is witch hazel.</li>
            <li>Would definitely buy this product again, worth the money.</li>
            <li>Firstly, my reason for getting this is a little unconventional, it had been recommended to me to clean show-kittens&#x27; eyes and face between baths.  </li>
            <li>I have tried so many expensive products to clean my cats eyes and face.</li>
            <li>Natural therapy for those who believe in homeopathic care.</li>

            <li> Just pour a small amount of the solution into the eye bath which is included, hold against your eye, move your eye around for a few seconds and then discard.</li>
            <li> I thinks the other products would irritate his eyes and make things worse.</li>
            <li> Not sure if its from wearing contacts, dust mite allergies, tired or just a combo.</li>

            <li> Just as I remember it from my childhood in Britain!</li>
            <li> Firstly, my reason for getting this is a little unconventional, it had been recommended to me to clean show-kittens&#x27; eyes and face between baths.  As an eye wash it seems to work just great. To remove stains from fur -- I&#x27;ve had better.</li>
            <li> Excellent!! I grew up in Toronto, Canada and used this product previously.  I recently introduced this product to my American Opthamologist.</li>
            <li> The item was as described and it arrived promptly to my mail box.</li>
            <li> I grew up in the UK using Optrex. Its been around for ages and is very well known over there.  I&#x27;ve always had problems with my eyes being sore, stinging, burning etc. Not sure if its from wearing contacts, dust mite allergies, tired or just a combo. But this product really helps.  The  main ingredient is witch hazel. Just pour a small amount of the solution into the eye bath which is included, hold against your eye, move your eye around for a few seconds and then discard. Sometimes I repeat.  It soothes and refreshes my eyes every time. So nice to see this product available on Amazon. Optrex makes a whole range of eye products, mostly eye drops which are equally good.</li>
            <li> I bought three Optrex products as I work late and long hours. My eyes are toast. The products I bought from Optrex are great, blood shot eyes, bright eyes and the wash are extremely effective.</li>
            <li> I have a Persian cat and there eyes tear brown. I have tried so many expensive products to clean my cats eyes and face. Some worked and some did not. It was a daily battle. Last year I went to a cat show and learned about Optrex from a lady that shows Persian cats. This product is amazing!!! I clean my cats eyes and his eyes and face remains clean for about 3 weeks. I thinks the other products would irritate his eyes and make things worse.</li>
            <li> Would definitely buy this product again, worth the money. This product works very well, very good  for tired eyes;which I suffer from since I read a lot.</li>
            <li> I am familiar with the Optrex brand which I have not seen in the US. The only other place that I have gotten it from apart from my country of birth (Trinidad) is Canada.</li>
            <li> Eliminate sore scratchy eyes in seconds, a very soothing product, well recommended. The eyebath works a treat. Buy it now</li>
            <li> provides comfort for dry, irritated eyes. My job requires staring at computer for extended hours and these are a lifesaver.</li>
            <li> Just perfect as expected and just like last time.</li>
            <li> Great for cleaning eyes, removing dust and just washing out protein.</li>
            <li> Growing up in the UK, Optrex was a staple of every medicine cabinet- great for soothing tired/sore/itchy eyes. I was thrilled to find it online!</li>
            <li> I use this on my Persian cats to clean their eyes and remove tear stains. It&#x27;s great because it leaves a protective film on the fur so future tearing does not stain the area around the eyes. I&#x27;ve used every product on the market and this one works the best. I pour a little Optrex on the corner of a clean washcloth and wipe the entire around their eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also used Optrex when a cat has an eye infection when antibiotics alone didn&#x27;t seem to work. Keeping the eyes clean with Optrex helped them heal when used with an antibiotic.</li>
            <li> Soothing. Overall nice to have some time to relax and give your eyes a break. 10/10 would buy again.</li>
            <li> I used this product before moving to the USA, where it is not available.  I prefer it to the eye washes available here, so finally being able to purchase it again was a relief.</li>
            <li> I give this product/seller 5 stars because it item was received quickly and safely and works great. I use this product to clean the eyes on my white Persian cat. It is the only product that I have tried that has worked and not irritated his eyes. Thanks</li>
            <li> This is a good product that actually cleans and soothes the eye of all discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;This is a good item to keep at home for temporary eye discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will always use this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maurice Jacob.</li>
            <li> Thank you for the quick shipment to the US!! I&#x27;ve been using the eye wash for a couple of days now and my eyes feel like they used to. I just order a second shipment.</li>
            <li> Perfect for dry eyes therapy, especially for those who have sensitive eyes. Natural therapy for those who believe in homeopathic care.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.  Packaged really well.  Thanks.</li>
