            <li>This toothbrush is so much better!  </li>
            <li>Toothbrushing was a bit of a struggle before, but it is much better now!  </li>
            <li>she doesn&#x27;t fight me at all, and in fact she likes to grab the brush and brush her own teeth.  </li>
            <li>and they liked them.</li>
            <li>That is by far one of the best toothbrushes I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft and about the perfect size for my toddler&#x27;s mouth.</li>
            <li>Perfect for my 17 months old twins.</li>
            <li>These are cute soft bristled brushes that are perfect for toddlers.  </li>

            <li>I am glad I got it for her.</li>
            <li>Pleased with this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Tried several and this was one of he best.</li>
            <li>It is just so cute to see that :)</li>
            <li>so let me just add I like the pastel colours too :)</li>
            <li>My son didn&#x27;t mind though. :)</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine how many teeth would have been lost if I did not follow this regimen.  </li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>i love it</li>
            <li>I love this set of toothbrush for my toddler who bites and chews while \\&quot;brushing\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, cute design.</li>
            <li>These are great for 1-4 year old kids.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;They do get wear out easily so have to keep ordering.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy for my daughter to hold and put in her mouth.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s equally as easy for me to hold and brush her teeth.</li>
            <li>The handle is easy for us to hold when brushing his teeth.  </li>
            <li>These are perfect for little ones to hold and brush.</li>
            <li>It would also be nice to have a more gender neutral color, but he&#x27;s 19 months old now</li>
            <li>When I saw they didn&#x27;t fit</li>
            <li>We also let him brush his own teeth after we are done with the real brushing.  </li>
            <li>,i receive pink one, but nice the toothbrush is good,</li>
            <li>The picture of Tigger on the bottom of the front of the handle is a cute addition too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a soft toothbrush, it does a great job to gently brush my dog&#x27;s teeth.</li>
            <li>The Baby Banana had silicone &amp;#34;bristles&amp;#34; which was nice for starting out, but I wanted something more significant to make sure his teeth were getting clean.</li>
            <li>my daughter gets excited when I ask whether Piglet or Tigger should brush her teeth.  </li>
            <li>and she wanted her own brush to keep those new teeth clean.  </li>
            <li>They stand up well to chewing and fit nicely in my 14month old&#x27;s mouth.</li>
            <li>The brush head is the right size and the handle is easy to control.</li>
            <li>/&gt;We also got the Sid the Science Kid book about cavities being holes in your teeth, and he seemed to be more amenable to letting us brush his teeth after that as well.</li>
            <li>not so easy to use as baby&#x27;s first toothbrush..</li>
            <li>6-14-14:  We are still using this style brush for our just-turned-2-year-old; he just has his 2nd dentist appointment, and the dentist was quite pleased with his teeth :)&lt;</li>
            <li>This is our 12 month old&#x27;s first toothbrush, and he lets us brush his teeth with it, so I love it!  </li>
            <li>I also appreciate the large handle which is easy for me to grip as my cats squirm around.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s colorful</li>
            <li>Makes brushing fun with the Winnie the Pooh characters.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is important when brushing a dog&#x27;s teeth to assure that it is an all round good experience for the dog and for you so to not cause trauma.</li>
            <li>Just the right size, shape and color  for them.</li>
            <li>His teeth really seem to be getting clean and it has never bothered him or irritated his gums at all.</li>
            <li>These are great little toothbrushes for the beginning brusher!</li>
            <li>This is easy to hold for both me and my 1 year old.  </li>
            <li>They are soft and easy for him to hold and brush himself (as well as a toddler can).</li>
            <li>My daughter only has 3 teeth, so I brush them mostly as a learning exercise.  </li>
            <li>And occasionally she&#x27;ll try to brush her hair with it too :).&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the perfect size for him to hold and maneuver himself, so after I get a nice base cleaning done, I let him practice which he really likes.</li>
            <li>The brush fits good and are really soft, as they should be, and I hope by starting at a young age, he will learn to care for his teeth!</li>
            <li>this one by far has been used by him for more than a month and still looks the same as the first time we got it.&lt;br /&gt;Thumbs up!</li>
            <li>The bristles are super soft.  </li>
            <li>Made for 2-24 month old babies but works great for my small Yorkshire Terrier.</li>
            <li>find that all toothbrushes made for dogs are way too large.</li>
            <li>The 2 pack is great because I can put one in each bathroom or for when he loses one after playing with it!</li>
            <li>The 2 pack is great because I can put one in each bathroom or for when he loses one after playing with it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with these, so I purchased a load of them (for my 4 small rescues:  Chihuahua, Brussels Griffon, Yorkie &amp; Papillon), and these work very well.  </li>
            <li>He will let me brush them about 10 seconds and will giggle, then he wants to do it and chew on it.  </li>
            <li>She enjoys brushing her teeth so much that she always pointed to the toothbrush holder whenever we took her to the bathroom to wash her hands.</li>
            <li>He took to it really well.  </li>
            <li>Thanks ...</li>
            <li>He is very eager to do it himself after she brushes his teeth.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t think any other toothbrush would have done much better.</li>
            <li>Easy for my nearly 17 month old to hold (we started using this when she was 13 months old) and the small head makes it easy to reach and clean all her</li>
            <li>The brush area is nice and wide, but small enough to fit easily into his mouth.  </li>
            <li>Soft bristles and very gentle on the gums.</li>
            <li>I bought this toothbrush for my 10 month old as his first teeth were coming in.  </li>
            <li>He&#x27;s only got 7 teeth so far but seems to enjoy brushing teeth.</li>
            <li>The bristles are nice and soft, but hold up for a few months under the stress of my toddler chewing on it every day.</li>
            <li>These are the best small toothbrushes I have found (and I&#x27;ve tried a lot if not all of them) for brushing my small dogs&#x27; teeth.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>I would easily recommend it to other parents.</li>
            <li>I normally would brush my daughters teeth</li>
            <li>The head is small enough to fit in my cats&#x27; mouths and make brushing their teeth easy.</li>
            <li>These toothbrushes last about a month and half before I figure I should replace them, so it is nice to have the affordable option of buying two at a time.</li>
            <li>It is very soft.</li>
            <li>He loves gettting his teeth brushed except he doesn&#x27;t want me to brush them, he wants to chew on the toothbrush!  </li>
            <li>First, I finally realized that if I am holding this brush with more than 2 or 3 fingers, I tend to push too hard, and my son complains, and then doesn&#x27;t let me continue with the brushing.  </li>
            <li>These brushes have toddler-friendly grips, the bristles are nice and soft and the head is not too big and not to small.  </li>
            <li>One caution is that if you have a strong color preference (ie you don&#x27;t want to give a pink brush to your boy or blue brush to your girl)</li>
            <li>The bristles are softer and hold up well to my 11 month old chewing on them (this is an inevitble consequence of brushing an 11 month&#x27;s old teeth).  </li>
            <li>Before giving my 1 year old niece this toothbrush, I carried her with me every time I brush my teeth.</li>
            <li>so she&#x27;d pick it over the adult tooth brush when I asked her to pick hers.</li>
            <li>The head is soft so it doesn&#x27;t damage her baby gum.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 17 months old.</li>
            <li>The brush is soft enough not to stab his sensitive gums, but still cleans really well.  </li>
            <li>I got this toothbrush when he was about 18 months old, to replace his old Baby Banana toothbrush.</li>
            <li>My 15 month old loves these.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as soft as I would have preferred.</li>
            <li>My son is 20 months old and he&#x27;s got shark teeth!&lt;br</li>
            <li>The bristles are really soft so not to agitate baby&#x27;s gums where there are no teeth yet.</li>
            <li>The size of the head works well and the shape of the handle is easy for me and my little one to use!</li>
            <li>The size of the head works well and the shape of the handle is easy for me and my little one to use!</li>
            <li>The handle has a nice wide flat area so that you can write their name on it for daycare, but it is not too wide for the toothbrush holder they use at daycare.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The only cons to speak of: he has been able to bite out a couple bristles, but he was pretty tough on it</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I definitely recommend, and would repurchase if I needed a new one</li>
            <li>Super soft bristles, tiny brush, and fits perfectly in my little guys mouth.  </li>
            <li>(since that definitely almost happened once so far).</li>
            <li>This brush is soft enough and does the job well.</li>
            <li>I bought some all natural toothpaste (no chemicals or fluoride), since he will swallow as opposed to spit due to his young age of 14 months.  </li>

            <li> First, I finally realized that if I am holding this brush with more than 2 or 3 fingers, I tend to push too hard, and my son complains, and then doesn&#x27;t let me continue with the brushing.  </li>
            <li> These brushes have toddler-friendly grips, the bristles are nice and soft and the head is not too big and not to small.  </li>
            <li> One caution is that if you have a strong color preference (ie you don&#x27;t want to give a pink brush to your boy or blue brush to your girl)</li>
            <li> The bristles are softer and hold up well to my 11 month old chewing on them (this is an inevitble consequence of brushing an 11 month&#x27;s old teeth).  </li>
            <li> Before giving my 1 year old niece this toothbrush, I carried her with me every time I brush my teeth.</li>
            <li> so she&#x27;d pick it over the adult tooth brush when I asked her to pick hers.</li>
            <li> The head is soft so it doesn&#x27;t damage her baby gum.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 17 months old.</li>
            <li> The brush is soft enough not to stab his sensitive gums, but still cleans really well.  </li>
            <li> I got this toothbrush when he was about 18 months old, to replace his old Baby Banana toothbrush.</li>
            <li> My 15 month old loves these.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as soft as I would have preferred.</li>
            <li> My son is 20 months old and he&#x27;s got shark teeth!&lt;br</li>
            <li> The bristles are really soft so not to agitate baby&#x27;s gums where there are no teeth yet.</li>
            <li> The size of the head works well and the shape of the handle is easy for me and my little one to use!</li>
            <li> The size of the head works well and the shape of the handle is easy for me and my little one to use!</li>
            <li> The handle has a nice wide flat area so that you can write their name on it for daycare, but it is not too wide for the toothbrush holder they use at daycare.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The only cons to speak of: he has been able to bite out a couple bristles, but he was pretty tough on it</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I definitely recommend, and would repurchase if I needed a new one</li>
            <li> Super soft bristles, tiny brush, and fits perfectly in my little guys mouth.  </li>
            <li> (since that definitely almost happened once so far).</li>
            <li> This brush is soft enough and does the job well.</li>
            <li> I bought some all natural toothpaste (no chemicals or fluoride), since he will swallow as opposed to spit due to his young age of 14 months.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are soft and they are not as deep as other similar tots&#x27; toothbrushes, i.e. the bristles of the brush (from where they attach to the toothbrush head) to their tips is the shortest I&#x27;ve found.  </li>
            <li> we have a back up in case she decides to throw the toothbrush in the toilet</li>
            <li> I was worried that any bristles might be too harsh on his gums, but these are very, very soft.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s small enough to get inside her mouth and soft enough that it wont hurt her gums or teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The bottom line here is I highly recommend these brushes for small dogs (&lt;10 pounds).</li>
            <li> (since it&#x27;s made of hard plastic, not soft silicone) so this hasn&#x27;t been much of an issue.</li>
            <li> Just what we needed for our baby&#x27;s new little teeth!</li>
            <li> We received one pink and one blue brush.</li>
            <li> &quot; like a monkey while we brush the front of his incisors and canines, and then \\&quot;aaaaah\\&quot; while we brush the molars and backs of the incisors and canines.  </li>
            <li> particular toothbrush is small and narrow enough to get to the back teeth without causing any discomfort to the dog.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Because they get their teeth brushed very other night and each get a squirt of chlorhexadine every night.  </li>
            <li> This toothbrush would last about 6 weeks or less if it starts falling apart.</li>
            <li> However, since he is 2, that is subject to change at any moment for no apparent reason :-/&lt;br</li>
            <li> this toothbrush is too rough for the baby.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve only used it a few times, and he hasn&#x27;t had a dentist appointment yet, so I can&#x27;t say anything about how well it is working, but it seems to me to do the job</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use any other toothbrush but this one.</li>
            <li> The bristles are  shorter compared to other brands, which helps in preventing him to pull out the bristles with his teeth.</li>
            <li> This came with two brushes, but you do not get to pick the colors, so we got a green brush and a pink brush.  </li>
            <li> I like the bristle, but the round tip shape makes it hard for it to go into the tiny mouth.</li>
            <li> I had previously tried a nuk toothbrush and one of those plastic brushes you stick on your finger.  </li>
            <li> Winne the Pooh makes it just a little easier to get her to brush teeth when she has a pooh toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I like these little toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> The brush has a grip too for small hands.</li>
            <li> It is small</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even brush hard, but everytime I wiped the mouth with cloth, there&#x27;s blood.  </li>

            <li> My daughter is one now and she watches mommy and daddy brush their teeth and she just got 4 teeth in and she wanted her own brush to keep those new teeth clean.  She LOVES this brush!  She has it all the time now, she wont go anywhere without it.  If you try and take it away from her she screams bloody murder. I am glad I got it for her.</li>
            <li> I like the bristle, but the round tip shape makes it hard for it to go into the tiny mouth.</li>
            <li> The size of the head works well and the shape of the handle is easy for me and my little one to use! The 2 pack is great because I can put one in each bathroom or for when he loses one after playing with it!</li>
            <li> Pleased with this toothbrush. Tried several and this was one of he best. Would buy this toothbrush again. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Winne the Pooh makes it just a little easier to get her to brush teeth when she has a pooh toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I had previously tried a nuk toothbrush and one of those plastic brushes you stick on your finger.  This toothbrush is so much better!  The bristles are softer and hold up well to my 11 month old chewing on them (this is an inevitble consequence of brushing an 11 month&#x27;s old teeth).  And as an added bonus I don&#x27;t get my finger bit off.</li>
            <li> These are perfect for little ones to hold and brush. I normally would brush my daughters teeth and then she would try to do it herself. It is just so cute to see that :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They do get wear out easily so have to keep ordering. But at Amazon prices, its still a good deal!</li>
            <li> The baby liked the product, the product is very good, the next time I have to buy, it&#x27;s very good!!!</li>
            <li> Good first toothbrush! Easy for my nearly 17 month old to hold (we started using this when she was 13 months old) and the small head makes it easy to reach and clean all her teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like that it&#x27;s sold as a two pack that way we have a back up in case she decides to throw the toothbrush in the toilet (since that definitely almost happened once so far).</li>
            <li> The size of the head works well and the shape of the handle is easy for me and my little one to use! The 2 pack is great because I can put one in each bathroom or for when he loses one after playing with it!</li>
            <li> I bought these as toothbrushes for my cats, since cat toothbrushes tend to a bit overpriced. The head is small enough to fit in my cats&#x27; mouths and make brushing their teeth easy. I also appreciate the large handle which is easy for me to grip as my cats squirm around. Great price as well!</li>
            <li> This is easy to hold for both me and my 1 year old.  The bristles are super soft.  My daughter only has 3 teeth, so I brush them mostly as a learning exercise.  she doesn&#x27;t fight me at all, and in fact she likes to grab the brush and brush her own teeth.  And occasionally she&#x27;ll try to brush her hair with it too :).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, great toddler toothbrush.  I am very happy with this.</li>
            <li> Super soft bristles, tiny brush, and fits perfectly in my little guys mouth.  I bought some all natural toothpaste (no chemicals or fluoride), since he will swallow as opposed to spit due to his young age of 14 months.  He loves gettting his teeth brushed except he doesn&#x27;t want me to brush them, he wants to chew on the toothbrush!  He will let me brush them about 10 seconds and will giggle, then he wants to do it and chew on it.  The brush fits good and are really soft, as they should be, and I hope by starting at a young age, he will learn to care for his teeth!</li>
            <li> Before giving my 1 year old niece this toothbrush, I carried her with me every time I brush my teeth. When the toothbrush arrived, I gave my niece this and she instantly knew what to do with it. It&#x27;s colorful so she&#x27;d pick it over the adult tooth brush when I asked her to pick hers. The head is soft so it doesn&#x27;t damage her baby gum. She enjoys brushing her teeth so much that she always pointed to the toothbrush holder whenever we took her to the bathroom to wash her hands.</li>
            <li> I purchased Oral-B Stages 1 Disney Baby 4-24 Months Toothbrush, and  I have a boy,i receive pink one, but nice the toothbrush is good,</li>
            <li> My daughter loves to look at the pictures on these (eeyore and tigger), and laughs before she puts the toothbrush in her mouth to &amp;#34;brush&amp;#34; her teeth.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 17 months old. He&#x27;s only got 7 teeth so far but seems to enjoy brushing teeth. This brush is soft enough and does the job well.</li>
            <li> I like these little toothbrushes. They stand up well to chewing and fit nicely in my 14month old&#x27;s mouth. Have to fill up some space here so let me just add I like the pastel colours too :)</li>
            <li> not so easy to use as baby&#x27;s first toothbrush..i recommend those 360degree one</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush for my 10 month old as his first teeth were coming in.  He took to it really well.  The brush is soft enough not to stab his sensitive gums, but still cleans really well.  This came with two brushes, but you do not get to pick the colors, so we got a green brush and a pink brush.  My son didn&#x27;t mind though. :)</li>
            <li> My kid always chew on toothbrush.. and this is the one which can last!  It&#x27;s durable and it&#x27;s perfect size for kid!</li>
            <li> These are great little toothbrushes for the beginning brusher! The bristles are nice and soft, but hold up for a few months under the stress of my toddler chewing on it every day. The handle has a nice wide flat area so that you can write their name on it for daycare, but it is not too wide for the toothbrush holder they use at daycare. We bought several!</li>
            <li> working good item 100%  Thanks ...</li>
            <li> When I saw they didn&#x27;t fit I gave them to the grandkids and they liked them. Just the right size, shape and color  for them.</li>
            <li> Very nice toothbrush. I bought it for my daughter when she was 13 months. It is very soft. She loves it.</li>
            <li> this toothbrush is too rough for the baby.  We were using something else and I wanted to change it since it&#x27;s been a couple of month.  Everytime I use this tooth brush, baby&#x27;s bleeding somewhere in the mouth.  I don&#x27;t even brush hard, but everytime I wiped the mouth with cloth, there&#x27;s blood.  Of course, I can&#x27;t tell where it&#x27;s coming from because the baby won&#x27;t let me look at his mouth</li>
            <li> That is by far one of the best toothbrushes I&#x27;ve tried. It&#x27;s soft and about the perfect size for my toddler&#x27;s mouth.</li>
            <li> I got this toothbrush when he was about 18 months old, to replace his old Baby Banana toothbrush. The Baby Banana had silicone &amp;#34;bristles&amp;#34; which was nice for starting out, but I wanted something more significant to make sure his teeth were getting clean. I was worried that any bristles might be too harsh on his gums, but these are very, very soft. His teeth really seem to be getting clean and it has never bothered him or irritated his gums at all. It&#x27;s the perfect size for him to hold and maneuver himself, so after I get a nice base cleaning done, I let him practice which he really likes. He actually cries sometimes when I take it away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only cons to speak of: he has been able to bite out a couple bristles, but he was pretty tough on it and I don&#x27;t think any other toothbrush would have done much better. It&#x27;s not as tempting for him to chew on as his last toothbrush though (since it&#x27;s made of hard plastic, not soft silicone) so this hasn&#x27;t been much of an issue. It would also be nice to have a more gender neutral color, but he&#x27;s 19 months old now so he doesn&#x27;t care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I definitely recommend, and would repurchase if I needed a new one (but this is a pack of two so it will be a while).</li>
            <li> Perfect for my 17 months old twins. Soft bristles and very gentle on the gums. The brush has a grip too for small hands. Love them!!</li>
            <li> These are the best small toothbrushes I have found (and I&#x27;ve tried a lot if not all of them) for brushing my small dogs&#x27; teeth.  The bristles are soft and they are not as deep as other similar tots&#x27; toothbrushes, i.e. the bristles of the brush (from where they attach to the toothbrush head) to their tips is the shortest I&#x27;ve found.  I&#x27;m very pleased with these, so I purchased a load of them (for my 4 small rescues:  Chihuahua, Brussels Griffon, Yorkie &amp; Papillon), and these work very well.  The \\&quot;guys\\&quot; just had their annual dental yesterday, and only one tooth was lost (the Yorkie, that is genetically prone to bad dentition) amongst them.  Why?  Because they get their teeth brushed very other night and each get a squirt of chlorhexadine every night.  I can&#x27;t imagine how many teeth would have been lost if I did not follow this regimen.  :)  The bottom line here is I highly recommend these brushes for small dogs (&lt;10 pounds).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy for my daughter to hold and put in her mouth.  It&#x27;s equally as easy for me to hold and brush her teeth.</li>
            <li> We got this two pack because our toddler is always standing outside of the bathroom saying &amp;#34;Teeth&amp;#34; while we are brushing ours... we hand her a toothbrush, and she happily chews on it and &amp;#34;brushes&amp;#34; her teeth... But sometimes she wanders around with the brush and we find it later in the couch cushions- which makes it essential to have extra brushes on hand.  These brushes have toddler-friendly grips, the bristles are nice and soft and the head is not too big and not to small.  One caution is that if you have a strong color preference (ie you don&#x27;t want to give a pink brush to your boy or blue brush to your girl) you will get what you get.  We received one pink and one blue brush.</li>
            <li> Simple to hold for a parent or a child. Easy to use, cute design. Makes brushing fun with the Winnie the Pooh characters.</li>
            <li> My daughter uses this toothbrush for her son. He is very eager to do it himself after she brushes his teeth. She is happy with this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> My 15 month old loves these. They are soft and easy for him to hold and brush himself (as well as a toddler can). Good buy.</li>
            <li> Toothbrushing was a bit of a struggle before, but it is much better now!  These are cute soft bristled brushes that are perfect for toddlers.  I like that they come in a 2 pack- my daughter gets excited when I ask whether Piglet or Tigger should brush her teeth.  We hope to see Winnie next time!</li>
            <li> My daughter (13 mo.) loves her toothbrush.  Uses it every day.  A well-made product.  No complaints.  I would easily recommend it to other parents.</li>
            <li> I brush my daughter&#x27;s teeth twice a day (once in a while 3 times a day) and she &amp;#34;practices&amp;#34; each time after I am done.  These toothbrushes last about a month and half before I figure I should replace them, so it is nice to have the affordable option of buying two at a time.</li>
            <li> It is small so it fits in her mouth but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as soft as I would have preferred.</li>
            <li> The Oral-B Stage 1 toothbrush for 2-24 months is the only toothbrush I use for my Yorkies teeth.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s small enough to get inside her mouth and soft enough that it wont hurt her gums or teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that all toothbrushes made for dogs are way too large. I just can not get into the side of her mouth with them without risking causing discomfort for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is important when brushing a dog&#x27;s teeth to assure that it is an all round good experience for the dog and for you so to not cause trauma. Otherwise your dog will likely run and hide when it is time to brush your dogs teeth again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend the [[ASIN:B008CC3LRM Oral-B Stages 1 Disney Baby 4-24 Months Toothbrush, 1 Count (Pack of 2) Colors and Designs May Vary]] for anyone brushing the teeth of their toy dog.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular toothbrush is small and narrow enough to get to the back teeth without causing any discomfort to the dog.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like the rubber back on the handle. The picture of Tigger on the bottom of the front of the handle is a cute addition too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a soft toothbrush, it does a great job to gently brush my dog&#x27;s teeth. I don&#x27;t use any other toothbrush but this one. Made for 2-24 month old babies but works great for my small Yorkshire Terrier.</li>
            <li> This is our 12 month old&#x27;s first toothbrush, and he lets us brush his teeth with it, so I love it!  The brush area is nice and wide, but small enough to fit easily into his mouth.  The handle is easy for us to hold when brushing his teeth.  We&#x27;ve only used it a few times, and he hasn&#x27;t had a dentist appointment yet, so I can&#x27;t say anything about how well it is working, but it seems to me to do the job just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 6-14-14:  We are still using this style brush for our just-turned-2-year-old; he just has his 2nd dentist appointment, and the dentist was quite pleased with his teeth :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I just want to share my experience for what finally worked for getting my toddler to let me brush his teeth... First, I finally realized that if I am holding this brush with more than 2 or 3 fingers, I tend to push too hard, and my son complains, and then doesn&#x27;t let me continue with the brushing.  What has finally worked for us is to get him to say \\&quot;eee-eee-eee\\&quot; like a monkey while we brush the front of his incisors and canines, and then \\&quot;aaaaah\\&quot; while we brush the molars and backs of the incisors and canines.  This has been working really well for a few months now. We also let him brush his own teeth after we are done with the real brushing.  However, since he is 2, that is subject to change at any moment for no apparent reason :-/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We also got the Sid the Science Kid book about cavities being holes in your teeth, and he seemed to be more amenable to letting us brush his teeth after that as well.</li>
            <li> e uma gracinha e meu baby vai adora ela e flexivel propria pra baby recomendo!!!tank you!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;obrigada sempre!!!!!!!recomendo i love it</li>
            <li> These are great for 1-4 year old kids.  The brush head is the right size and the handle is easy to control.</li>
            <li> My son is 20 months old and he&#x27;s got shark teeth!&lt;br /&gt;We used 2 different brand brushes and they did not hold up..&lt;br /&gt;But this one by far has been used by him for more than a month and still looks the same as the first time we got it.&lt;br /&gt;Thumbs up!</li>
            <li> I love this set of toothbrush for my toddler who bites and chews while \\&quot;brushing\\&quot;. The bristles are  shorter compared to other brands, which helps in preventing him to pull out the bristles with his teeth. This toothbrush would last about 6 weeks or less if it starts falling apart. Disney designs on the handle are a plus.</li>
            <li> Just what we needed for our baby&#x27;s new little teeth! The bristles are really soft so not to agitate baby&#x27;s gums where there are no teeth yet.</li>
