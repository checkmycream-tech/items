            <li>High quality, will buy again!</li>
            <li>I really like Plant Therapy products.</li>
            <li>I Like it, its very relax,</li>
            <li>That said, I&#x27;m really liking it.</li>
            <li>This is very encouraging.  </li>
            <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 stars is that the bottle is shipped in a bubble wrap and there is no packaging which help preventing light from going through.  </li>
            <li>I tried many products for the essential oil and finally met Plant Therapy - really organic and powerful.</li>
            <li>plant therapy i am really liking as well</li>
            <li>i used way too fast.</li>
            <li>I use this with Jojoba oil on my scalp and it really accelerates hair growth and health.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t got to use it much yet,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying to get back to basics when cleaning,so, I&#x27;ve used the essential oil to add a pleasant but natural aroma to white vinegar that I use to clean surfaces in the kitchen and baths .</li>
            <li>Very nice aroma, only need a few drops.</li>
            <li>Now my hair is extra fresh!</li>
            <li>I usually purchase doTerra essential oils as the quality is great, but it can be pricey for a reason.</li>
            <li>I oreder this ,got it very fast so far its been 3 to 4 month</li>
            <li>So far I really like it!</li>
            <li>each one of the essential oils I&#x27;ve purchased from here, have come quickly in bubble wrap with no problems.</li>
            <li>but I only use essential oils for the purpose of enjoying the aromas in the air or on my body.</li>
            <li>I adore this high quality rosemary oil.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and don&#x27;t forget to mix or dulute with a carrier oil, lotion, etc.</li>
            <li>I would recommend using this product to add to lotions , body oil and natural cleaning products !!</li>
            <li>Aroma is strongly of Rosemary - no mineral or other off scents.</li>
            <li>A few drops of rosemary oil mixed win another essential works wonders!</li>
            <li>Is that normal?</li>
            <li>Another addition to my &amp;#34;essential oil first aid kit&amp;#34;  I&#x27;m very please with the quality of these oils and look forward to using for various things in the months ahead.</li>
            <li>This rosemary is potent and just a few drops will do the job.</li>
            <li>It came with a booklet on uses for essential oils which was useful.</li>
            <li>If you put too many drops you might feel heavy and saturated.  </li>
            <li>wished it were bigger, but it was worth the buy.</li>
            <li>So trust me I have tried everything and now created my own little regime that has personally worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Listen up to know more!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>bottle is dark which is necessary for keeping the quality of essential oils so that is a good thing.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>Thanks PT, I love your EO&#x27;s or at least the ones that I&#x27;ve had the privilege of experiencing.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also strong so you can use less.</li>
            <li>But it is an excellent oil, I was a little disappointed at the size at first, but I considered it is pretty standard for the quality, and price is not bad at all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to using essential oils, and rosemary one of my first to use.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with this company thus far, even though some small leakage in the package was noted, not enough to contact the company, no damage to the bottle noted.</li>
            <li>This is my first time purchasing an essential oil</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s workon for my hair because I use more than just this on my hair.</li>
            <li>This was my first venture into essential oils.  </li>
            <li>This is a high quality product that has worked very well for me, and I will continue to purchase it as I run low.  </li>
            <li>Thank youfor the quick turn around and careful packaging.</li>
            <li>My Husband complained about the vinegar smell but with the addition of natural plant essential oil, we are very pleased.</li>
            <li>This oil smells nice as a base and as long as the smell is good</li>
            <li>In reading information on multiple sites, I knew to go organic, pure therapeutic grade and the type of bottle</li>
            <li>Seems like a very high quality essential oil to me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve added it to my shampoo,hair care products and also followed the approach on bottle of breathing to clear</li>
            <li>I just added a couple of drops and so far it has worked.</li>
            <li>They showed that lice wouldn&#x27;t go near it.</li>
            <li>I knew nothing about this brand of oil when I purchased it and was pleasantly surprised upon using it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a whole lot of experience with essential oils, but I bought this brand because it was recommended by a blogger</li>
            <li>and I have not had the chance to use it yet, but it seems to meet expectations of the description so far based on looking at it and the scent.</li>
            <li>Rosemary essential oil was very helpful with my allergies.  </li>
            <li>There is such a pureness to the smell and a very illuminating satisfaction of its properties.</li>
            <li>So far, it&#x27;s doing the job.</li>
            <li>I also inhale this daily, it really wakes you up.</li>
            <li>I saw that a user with &#x27;natural&#x27; hair puts it on her scalp</li>
            <li>This rosemary oil is extremely potent and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>Subtle to be sure.</li>
            <li>I mainly use it for hair care and for making a mouth rinse mixed with peppermint and cinnamon oil.</li>
            <li>I initially bought it for my hair just as an experiment to see if it actually works, but before I even tried it I just opened the bottle to sniff it for the first couple of days.</li>
            <li>This rosemary essential oil is of high quality.</li>
            <li>You can tell this product is of high Quality Standard.</li>
            <li>but I was losing hair for a long time and right after starting using the rosemary oil</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t sound like much to some, but I have worked so hard to achieve this result and cant wait to have my hair at my desired length!</li>
            <li>This scent is strong so be careful when using it as it can overpower other scents.</li>
            <li>I have struggled with extremely dry skin my whole life and this, along with brushing the skin, has defity helped.</li>
            <li>This oil is strong and a little does go a long way.</li>
            <li>I used it in my raw African Shea butter mixture and everyone loves the light smell it gives.</li>
            <li>I have an extensive selection of essential oils which high medicinal properties.  </li>
            <li>If I were giving it as a present, I would want the label to look a little fancier but for myself, the oil is super.  </li>
            <li>They snag and pull and if you have super thick natural curly hair like mine</li>
            <li>The rosemary resell does eliminate arthritis in your hand, lower backaches and I even stiff it to calm me</li>
            <li>it really is 100% pure, was skeptical at first</li>
            <li>I am a natural african american woman and i use this in my spray bottle mixes.</li>
            <li>It can be used for other things as well for example you can buy shey butter and mix it in (small quantities) and some other oil like grape-seed, and use it on your chest as an expectorant, or a nice hand lotion.  </li>
            <li>I apply is directly to my scalp while my hair is still damp, then I dry and style my hair.  </li>
            <li>Now, every time I open the drawer, this little bottle is exposed to the light (even though the bottle is dark).  </li>
            <li>The price was reasonable, especially for an organic product which are often double the price of conventional products.</li>
            <li>and as far as a little going a long way....when I did use it in my hair the smell lasted for about 5 days strong if not more.</li>

            <li> , I like it, good, very good ;)</li>
            <li> I still prefer the smell of air refresher as it&#x27;s more pleasant to the nose</li>
            <li> I use it to treat my hair and also to make the scent a bit more pleasant.</li>
            <li> I received great service and very quick delivery.</li>
            <li> It has a nice smell.</li>

            <li> They all come in some kind of a packaging.</li>

            <li> I really like Plant Therapy products.</li>
            <li> I Like it, its very relax,</li>
            <li> That said, I&#x27;m really liking it.</li>
            <li> This is very encouraging.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 stars is that the bottle is shipped in a bubble wrap and there is no packaging which help preventing light from going through.  </li>
            <li> I tried many products for the essential oil and finally met Plant Therapy - really organic and powerful.</li>
            <li> plant therapy i am really liking as well</li>
            <li> i used way too fast.</li>
            <li> I use this with Jojoba oil on my scalp and it really accelerates hair growth and health.</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t got to use it much yet,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to get back to basics when cleaning,so, I&#x27;ve used the essential oil to add a pleasant but natural aroma to white vinegar that I use to clean surfaces in the kitchen and baths .</li>
            <li> Very nice aroma, only need a few drops.</li>
            <li> Now my hair is extra fresh!</li>
            <li> I usually purchase doTerra essential oils as the quality is great, but it can be pricey for a reason.</li>
            <li> I oreder this ,got it very fast so far its been 3 to 4 month</li>
            <li> So far I really like it!</li>
            <li> each one of the essential oils I&#x27;ve purchased from here, have come quickly in bubble wrap with no problems.</li>
            <li> but I only use essential oils for the purpose of enjoying the aromas in the air or on my body.</li>
            <li> I adore this high quality rosemary oil.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and don&#x27;t forget to mix or dulute with a carrier oil, lotion, etc.</li>
            <li> I would recommend using this product to add to lotions , body oil and natural cleaning products !!</li>
            <li> Aroma is strongly of Rosemary - no mineral or other off scents.</li>
            <li> A few drops of rosemary oil mixed win another essential works wonders!</li>
            <li> Is that normal?</li>
            <li> Another addition to my &amp;#34;essential oil first aid kit&amp;#34;  I&#x27;m very please with the quality of these oils and look forward to using for various things in the months ahead.</li>
            <li> This rosemary is potent and just a few drops will do the job.</li>
            <li> It came with a booklet on uses for essential oils which was useful.</li>
            <li> If you put too many drops you might feel heavy and saturated.  </li>
            <li> wished it were bigger, but it was worth the buy.</li>
            <li> So trust me I have tried everything and now created my own little regime that has personally worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Listen up to know more!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> bottle is dark which is necessary for keeping the quality of essential oils so that is a good thing.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> Thanks PT, I love your EO&#x27;s or at least the ones that I&#x27;ve had the privilege of experiencing.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also strong so you can use less.</li>
            <li> But it is an excellent oil, I was a little disappointed at the size at first, but I considered it is pretty standard for the quality, and price is not bad at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to using essential oils, and rosemary one of my first to use.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this company thus far, even though some small leakage in the package was noted, not enough to contact the company, no damage to the bottle noted.</li>
            <li> This is my first time purchasing an essential oil</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s workon for my hair because I use more than just this on my hair.</li>
            <li> This was my first venture into essential oils.  </li>
            <li> This is a high quality product that has worked very well for me, and I will continue to purchase it as I run low.  </li>
            <li> Thank youfor the quick turn around and careful packaging.</li>
            <li> My Husband complained about the vinegar smell but with the addition of natural plant essential oil, we are very pleased.</li>
            <li> This oil smells nice as a base and as long as the smell is good</li>
            <li> In reading information on multiple sites, I knew to go organic, pure therapeutic grade and the type of bottle</li>
            <li> Seems like a very high quality essential oil to me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve added it to my shampoo,hair care products and also followed the approach on bottle of breathing to clear</li>
            <li> I just added a couple of drops and so far it has worked.</li>
            <li> They showed that lice wouldn&#x27;t go near it.</li>
            <li> I knew nothing about this brand of oil when I purchased it and was pleasantly surprised upon using it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a whole lot of experience with essential oils, but I bought this brand because it was recommended by a blogger</li>
            <li> and I have not had the chance to use it yet, but it seems to meet expectations of the description so far based on looking at it and the scent.</li>
            <li> Rosemary essential oil was very helpful with my allergies.  </li>
            <li> There is such a pureness to the smell and a very illuminating satisfaction of its properties.</li>
            <li> So far, it&#x27;s doing the job.</li>
            <li> I also inhale this daily, it really wakes you up.</li>
            <li> I saw that a user with &#x27;natural&#x27; hair puts it on her scalp</li>
            <li> This rosemary oil is extremely potent and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Subtle to be sure.</li>
            <li> I mainly use it for hair care and for making a mouth rinse mixed with peppermint and cinnamon oil.</li>
            <li> I initially bought it for my hair just as an experiment to see if it actually works, but before I even tried it I just opened the bottle to sniff it for the first couple of days.</li>
            <li> This rosemary essential oil is of high quality.</li>
            <li> You can tell this product is of high Quality Standard.</li>
            <li> but I was losing hair for a long time and right after starting using the rosemary oil</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t sound like much to some, but I have worked so hard to achieve this result and cant wait to have my hair at my desired length!</li>
            <li> This scent is strong so be careful when using it as it can overpower other scents.</li>
            <li> I have struggled with extremely dry skin my whole life and this, along with brushing the skin, has defity helped.</li>
            <li> This oil is strong and a little does go a long way.</li>
            <li> I used it in my raw African Shea butter mixture and everyone loves the light smell it gives.</li>
            <li> I have an extensive selection of essential oils which high medicinal properties.  </li>
            <li> If I were giving it as a present, I would want the label to look a little fancier but for myself, the oil is super.  </li>
            <li> They snag and pull and if you have super thick natural curly hair like mine</li>
            <li> The rosemary resell does eliminate arthritis in your hand, lower backaches and I even stiff it to calm me</li>
            <li> it really is 100% pure, was skeptical at first</li>
            <li> I am a natural african american woman and i use this in my spray bottle mixes.</li>
            <li> It can be used for other things as well for example you can buy shey butter and mix it in (small quantities) and some other oil like grape-seed, and use it on your chest as an expectorant, or a nice hand lotion.  </li>
            <li> I apply is directly to my scalp while my hair is still damp, then I dry and style my hair.  </li>
            <li> Now, every time I open the drawer, this little bottle is exposed to the light (even though the bottle is dark).  </li>
            <li> The price was reasonable, especially for an organic product which are often double the price of conventional products.</li>
            <li> and as far as a little going a long way....when I did use it in my hair the smell lasted for about 5 days strong if not more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m planning to seek some other scents in the near future.</li>
            <li> I have mixed it with other EO&#x27;s to make a &amp;#34;germ killer&amp;#34; spray as well as putting it in bath water for my 3 year old son.  </li>
            <li> (this oil is STRONG) but the ants sure hate it!</li>
            <li> High quality, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> About two weeks later, I noticed my scalp wasn&#x27;t dry or itchy as it once been.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this essential oil in a mix of other essential oils I combine for a diffuser.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s already pretty thick and long, but I have really dry scalp</li>
            <li> Arrived earlier than expected.  </li>
            <li> eat right, and treat myself to the unhealthy food occasionally!&lt;br /&gt;Exercise</li>
            <li> I have never used rosemary oil before, but I have used other essential oils.</li>
            <li> I am using this organic essential oil to purify my daughter&#x27;s room environment to help with allergies and other respiratory issues.</li>
            <li> I used this in conjunction with other essential oils to make beard balm and oil.</li>
            <li> I also add it to other organic oils or hair masks for the same effect.</li>
            <li> would help grow the hair and help with dry itchy, scalp.</li>
            <li> This by far out weights all other oils I have smelled; which have been a few.  </li>
            <li> I need to reorder as my bottle is down to the last drops!</li>
            <li> I am using this oil in a diffuser and it is working well and doing what I expected to do.</li>
            <li> its not diluted so i only use a few drops.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way so use sparingly.</li>
            <li> I mix it with other base oils and run my fingers through my dry hair and it makes for smooth shiny hair!</li>
            <li> This has helped with my hair loss due to the use of the medication, Tamoxifen.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve stopped using all products in my hair, even shampoo, and instead I water wash every other day, plus use a baking soda wash/apple cider vinegar</li>
            <li> I put several drops in a small spray bottle, mix with water, and use as a room freshener.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite overbearing and will hide the other scents.</li>
            <li> I bought it (and other products) to make homemade bug spray.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product as I&#x27;ve heard Rosemary can help with thinning hair due to PCOS.</li>
            <li> ( do not combine with oil will cause your hair to be extremely oily )</li>
            <li> Once I&#x27;ve seen results, I don&#x27;t use after every hair, just every other wash.</li>
            <li> But too small for something I need to use on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> This is the real stuff, not the watered-down fake extract from your corner beauty store.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li> A word of warning, however: putting in just a few drops at a time is somewhat difficult, the first time I added to my shampoo, I accidentally added about twenty drops in just a few seconds.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few weeks, so it&#x27;s hard to tell if there have been any benefits, but I like the way it smells</li>
            <li> I am combining it with black castor oil, and I do think it helps.</li>
            <li> This it helps me study, maintain concentration, and when the kids get crazy a few inhales of this helps to calm my brain.</li>
            <li> I take Black currant oil, Country hair maxi life, iron, biotin, and vitamin E to achieve a staple for working on the inside of my body for hair</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t rate it 5 stars because the pourer thingy makes it hard to get a single contained drop the way a dropper would.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I put a little on the tip of my nose before taking a test.</li>
            <li> Odor a little string but will deal with it if it works</li>
            <li> I am a 20 yr old female that began losing her hair at 18 due to a nutrition deficiency, combined with an immune disease my body started using the nutrition in my hair to help receive what it needed :(</li>
            <li> I add just a few drops to my shampoo and my hair oil treatments.  </li>
            <li> I put a few drops of this oil in a spray bottle with water, and mist it on my hair after showering, concentrating on the scalp.</li>
            <li> I put a few drops in my shampoo to promote hair growth.  </li>
            <li> I also put a few drops in my leave in conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I ordered the rosemary oil a few weeks ago</li>
            <li> I massage into my scalp a few times a week.  </li>
            <li> I also put a few drops into my finger tips and massage into my scalp after I take a shower.</li>
            <li> Oh, and I put a few drops in a sprayer bottle with water and used it to get rid of ants in my kitchen.</li>
            <li> Just add a few drops to her conditioning shampoo.</li>
            <li> smell was harsh and not to my liking</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m confused as to what I actually got.</li>
            <li> Its thick thats not diluted with other oils.</li>
            <li> My hair does seem a little fuller, but I am not sure if it is working yet.</li>
            <li> This stuff taste funny on food and leaves a bad taste in your mouth.</li>
            <li> Been using it in my hair for the past couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> Organic essential oils are hard to find and sometimes prohibitively expensive.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be hard to find</li>
            <li> It is hard to see the impact on the hair</li>
            <li> negative&#x27;s.....</li>
            <li> warts, pre-cancerous lesions, dandruff...at least it works for me...</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way though, and the price isn&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> and she has very long thick curly hair and was afraid she could get lice.</li>
            <li> is you&#x27;re having trouble growing your hair or if you have a really bad dry scalp.</li>
            <li> Seeing my hair grow will take time because the process is very slow but not losing hair is already great.&lt;br</li>
            <li> kills any weird stuff on skin...</li>
            <li> It is less expensive than buying fairytale lice repellent spray.</li>
            <li> It was very cold that week.  </li>
            <li> so I assumed the oil got very cold during delivery which cause the oil to leak out and all over the inside of the packaging.</li>
            <li> I use for cleaning, soaps, lotions, and in bug repellent.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This has helped with my hair loss due to the use of the medication, Tamoxifen.  If anyone has to take this medication for cancer treatment, this oil is a must.  Plus, your hair will smell really good!</li>
            <li> I ordered on the 8th and received this on the 10th (before Amazon even posted the shopped status). Quality product! It&#x27;s supposed to smell very strong, it&#x27;s a concentrated essential oil. I add just a few drops to my shampoo and my hair oil treatments.  I will definitely be a return customer!</li>
            <li> Love the smell, the price is great, and the packaging was perfect! Will definitely order from this company again!</li>
            <li> I received this order on time. I am enjoying the benefits of using this product and plan to purchase it again in the future.</li>
            <li> My favorite scent.  Smells 100% organic.. I would by again from this seller.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. Smells like it has menthol in it. Is that normal?</li>
            <li> I use it mixed with shampoo. I love how soft my hair feels after using it!  I&#x27;m not too impressed with the smell, but it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> Prompt shipment and item as described.</li>
            <li> My favorite scent.  Stimulating and pleasing at the same time.  Works good in my CPAP machine to give a restful nights sleep.</li>
            <li> strong smell, I have just applied it for a week so I will have to wait and see the result.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great in my hair, very refreshing</li>
            <li> Excellent product; smells good enough to eat/drink. It works well to shake off sleepiness, almost akin to smelling salts. If I get sleepy during the day, I put a drop on each wrist so that I&#x27;ll be breathing in the scent. I love it!</li>
            <li> each one of the essential oils I&#x27;ve purchased from here, have come quickly in bubble wrap with no problems. I use my diffuser and my house smells amazing!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s fun to learn which oils you need to use for which occasion.</li>
            <li> I adore this high quality rosemary oil. It has worked wonders for me! The oil has restored my hair loss and cleared my facial skin blemishes. I use 3-4 drops and massage into my scalp. I also mix it with organ and olive oil for skin. The scent is so awesome and exhilarating---really!---it&#x27;s energizing. The undercurrent of the fragrance is smooth, almost buttery. I will use it for life.</li>
            <li> Last night I threw five drops of this in my tub with some epsom salt and baking soda.  It was blissful.</li>
            <li> Essential Oil is as promised. Quality seems fine. No problems with shipping in a very timely manner.</li>
            <li> I am a natural african american woman and i use this in my spray bottle mixes. very aromatic! i love it!</li>
            <li> Help my chronic sinusitis rhinitis. I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> very many uses for this, like the oraganic!</li>
            <li> High quality, a little goes a long way. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality essential oils!</li>
            <li> I got this to add to our tangle spray after watching &#x27;The Doctors&#x27; as a lice deterrent. My daughter was going to be starting kindergarten and she has very long thick curly hair and was afraid she could get lice. I just added a couple of drops and so far it has worked. On &#x27;The Doctors&#x27; they showed that rosemary or lavender oil repels lice. They showed that lice wouldn&#x27;t go near it. It is less expensive than buying fairytale lice repellent spray.</li>
            <li> Great product and excellent customer service too!</li>
            <li> I am using this oil in a diffuser and it is working well and doing what I expected to do.</li>
            <li> Wonderful scent, good price and great communication with the seller. I use only the purest essential oils in my diffuser and will continue to buy from Plant Therapy Essential Oills.</li>
            <li> I knew nothing about this brand of oil when I purchased it and was pleasantly surprised upon using it. I used it for a hair &amp; scalp conditioning mixed with another oil before shampooing and it left my scalp pleasantly tingling and hair shiny.  Delicious rosemary smell...</li>
            <li> Another addition to my &amp;#34;essential oil first aid kit&amp;#34;  I&#x27;m very please with the quality of these oils and look forward to using for various things in the months ahead.</li>
            <li> Great to mix in hair oil recipes</li>
            <li> The product seems very good. I&#x27;m using it on my dogs and they both now push and shove to be first to get their treatment. Very happy with product, speed of delivery, and packaging.</li>
            <li> Love this oil and company. Amazing product !</li>
            <li> This is a high quality product that has worked very well for me, and I will continue to purchase it as I run low.  I would recommend this product and this company to everyone who has any need for essential oils.</li>
            <li> Awesome! It is just what i was looking for !</li>
            <li> Seems to be working. Just bought 2nd bottle!!!</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I use for cleaning, soaps, lotions, and in bug repellent. Arrives quickly and packaged well. Never had a problem with Plant Therapy - love their products.</li>
            <li> I love the way this makes my hair feel. My hair has never felt healthier!</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s say I didn&#x27;t realize how SMALL 10ml really is lol. A little goes a long way though, and the price isn&#x27;t bad. Good brand.</li>
            <li> I purchased this oil to use in my hair. I&#x27;ve stopped using all products in my hair, even shampoo, and instead I water wash every other day, plus use a baking soda wash/apple cider vinegar rinse 1x week. I put a few drops of this oil in a spray bottle with water, and mist it on my hair after showering, concentrating on the scalp. I purchased this oil because I read rosemary is good for thinning hair, scalp health, and to promote hair growth. I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few weeks, so it&#x27;s hard to tell if there have been any benefits, but I like the way it smells and my hair looks &amp; feels healthy.</li>
            <li> Love that this is organic and therapeutic grade. Order arrived very quickly!</li>
            <li> Great product. Aroma is strongly of Rosemary - no mineral or other off scents. Good price. I recommend and would purchase this again</li>
            <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve purchased Plant Therapy organic rosemary oil.  I love the smell.  I put several drops in a small spray bottle, mix with water, and use as a room freshener.  I love the fresh, piney scent.  I will continue to use Plant Therapy essential oils as I&#x27;ve always been very happy with the quality.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for. Great product and great value. Will definitely buy again when I need to add to my essential oil stash!</li>
            <li> This product regrows hair in the temple area. It&#x27;s great .</li>
            <li> Going to use my oil in carrier oil and will plan to use it making soaps.</li>
            <li> I bought this to add to my homemade lotion as it is good for for cell rejuvenation among other things. So far I really like it! I have struggled with extremely dry skin my whole life and this, along with brushing the skin, has defity helped.</li>
            <li> This essential oil smells great and has nice packaging too. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Again, like all the essential oils I buy on Amazon -- I researched until I found the best product for the price.  I am very pleased and will buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Pure rosemary oil.  Love the smell, now I need to get a diffuser.</li>
            <li> Very good product, I use it every day diluted with jojoba on my face.  Good price compared with other brands</li>
            <li> Been using it in my hair for the past couple of weeks. My hair falls out a lot less which is good for me! I thought i was going bald!</li>
            <li> This essential oil is great.  It has a wonderful smell and consistency.  I am very happy with it.  The price was reasonable, especially for an organic product which are often double the price of conventional products.</li>
            <li> Product is great! I use it in my shampoo as an extra buff, and it fills my bathroom with the scent of woods. A word of warning, however: putting in just a few drops at a time is somewhat difficult, the first time I added to my shampoo, I accidentally added about twenty drops in just a few seconds. Now my hair is extra fresh!</li>
            <li> I love this scent in my shampoo as it helps with hair growth. This scent is strong so be careful when using it as it can overpower other scents.</li>
            <li> Feels good on scalp. Like the scent.</li>
            <li> this smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> Not 100% pure like they advertize</li>
            <li> Very fast quick service. Excellent quality. Plan on purchasing more products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied with my purchase. I will order again.</li>
            <li> It is a good product. It has a nice smell. Very refreshing and makes hair smooth after the very first wash.</li>
            <li> excellent, shipped quick</li>
            <li> The smell is very pleasant and lasts for a while.  And it&#x27;s nice to know it&#x27;s organic, so it&#x27;s good for you too!</li>
            <li> Great stuff! Wife loved the oil, and wants to order more as soon as possible.</li>
            <li> This product meets all of my expectations. It is fragrant, light, and can be added to your favorite hair products. A drop is all that&#x27;s required.</li>
            <li> Good oil works well with other oils</li>
            <li> Its good and strong but I felt it was bit pricey.  It does not have a oily feel to it.</li>
            <li> Great scent. It&#x27;s also strong so you can use less. Seems like a very high quality essential oil to me.</li>
            <li> The rosemary oil is exactly as I would want it to be: the real thing with a lovely mild scent.</li>
            <li> This rosemary essential oil smells great. I don&#x27;t have a whole lot of experience with essential oils, but I bought this brand because it was recommended by a blogger I truly respect Mommypotamus @ http://www.mommypotamus.com/. The oil smells great, and works wonderfully  as an addition to my cleaning solution I make to clean countertops and other hard surfaces.  I also put a brush or two on my hair brush to stimulate hair growth. My hair does seem a little fuller, but I am not sure if it is working yet.</li>
            <li> This stuff taste funny on food and leaves a bad taste in your mouth.</li>
            <li> I heard that rosemary essential oil are good for brain function and so I got it. Haven&#x27;t been able to tell if my brain function better or not with it but it&#x27;s a very nice and pleasant flowery-tree-grass smell for my room. I still prefer the smell of air refresher as it&#x27;s more pleasant to the nose but this one is healthier.</li>
            <li> I am an essential oil person. I grow rosemary, I cook with rosemary and I use it in my diffusers. It is said to relieve depression, fatigue, and nervous exhaustion and for me I&#x27;d rather do this than prescription drugs.</li>
            <li> I got this because I read that rosemary oil is good for hair loss. I am combining it with black castor oil, and I do think it helps. It is also good for break-outs on skin, and it tightens pores! That was a surprise plus. I would buy this brand again.</li>
            <li> This is a great product I use on my shampoo, conditioner and cream, also I use it directly and keeps my hair shiny and healthy and handle the dryness of my skin.</li>
            <li> This oil is strong and a little does go a long way. I mainly use it for hair care and for making a mouth rinse mixed with peppermint and cinnamon oil. Love it!</li>
            <li> I put 5 drops of this essential oil in 2 tablespoons of body lotion.  It makes a great aromatic rub for sore muscles and joints.</li>
            <li> Very nice aroma, only need a few drops. Very soothing smell if you like rosemary. I used it in my raw African Shea butter mixture and everyone loves the light smell it gives.</li>
            <li> Arrived fast and in excellent condition.  I put a few drops in my shampoo to promote hair growth.  I also put a few drops in my leave in conditioner.  Smells wonderful, and organic is the only way to go!</li>
            <li> Feels and smells great! :)</li>
            <li> Nice product.  Good service.</li>
            <li> It seems very pure. The strongest Rosemary essential oil I have had, yet!</li>
            <li> love it so far...smells amazing...let&#x27;s see what it does for my hair!</li>
            <li> Wonderful oil! So many benefits and uses for Rosemary!&lt;br /&gt;Just as I expected and arrived in a timely fashion in good condition.</li>
            <li> I use it for my hair. its not diluted so i only use a few drops. i love it !</li>
            <li> I ordered the rosemary oil a few weeks ago and I have not had the chance to use it yet, but it seems to meet expectations of the description so far based on looking at it and the scent. I have never used rosemary oil before, but I have used other essential oils. I have no complaints and I am satisfied with the product at this point.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to using essential oils, and rosemary one of my first to use.  I put some drops in epsom salts to make fabric softener.  Laundry smells great.</li>
            <li> I need a second bottle! I incorporate this Into my daily skin care routine and it&#x27;s amazing for preventative anti aging. Smells wonderful and it&#x27;s a great quality oil. I need to reorder as my bottle is down to the last drops!</li>
            <li> Good stuff...i use it for insect bites and it works.</li>
            <li> This rosemary is potent and just a few drops will do the job. It is great for conditioning hair and very soothing if inhaled before bed time. It helps me sleep like a baby:)</li>
            <li> This is the real stuff, not the watered-down fake extract from your corner beauty store.&lt;br /&gt;A few drops are all you really need.</li>
            <li> Good, strong aromatic...</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I was wanting.  It arrived sooo fast,  I got the product to use on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> Strong and very much A GOOD Deal!</li>
            <li> This oil is beautiful....most times Rosemary oil&#x27;s have a strong almost stinky smell which can be a turn off to the wonderful benefits which are so good overall. I ordered this because the pricing was good and it&#x27;s 100% organic and pure oil. I&#x27;ve added it to my shampoo,hair care products and also followed the approach on bottle of breathing to clear negative&#x27;s.....I&#x27;m very pleased and will be purchasing more \\&quot;Plant Therapy oils\\&quot; in the future. Very good value and good quality...Mahalo!!</li>
            <li> Has a good fresh rosemary smell. If I were giving it as a present, I would want the label to look a little fancier but for myself, the oil is super.  I like to put it in the bath and rub it in my hair also.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of Rosemary and this smells so pure!</li>
            <li> Bought these oils to make my own horse fly spray, works well as well as the toxic fly sprays. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great essential oil..I&#x27;m using it on my oil diffuser...Great quality....</li>
            <li> I purchased this to apply to my hair/scalp. Don&#x27;t know if it will help or not - just started using it.  Smells pleasant.</li>
            <li> I like this essential oil. Smells great. Used it with olive oil and neem oil as an oil treatment for hair. Felt nice and minty.</li>
            <li> Perfect!  Came on time and I love the free delivery... I love that all Plant Therapy bottle of EO are lBeled what they are!</li>
            <li> Great product. I am using this organic essential oil to purify my daughter&#x27;s room environment to help with allergies and other respiratory issues. It is also great on my hair.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this purchase !! I&#x27;ve been trying to get back to basics when cleaning,so, I&#x27;ve used the essential oil to add a pleasant but natural aroma to white vinegar that I use to clean surfaces in the kitchen and baths . Love it !! My Husband complained about the vinegar smell but with the addition of natural plant essential oil, we are very pleased. I&#x27;m planning to seek some other scents in the near future. I&#x27;m very pleased with this company thus far, even though some small leakage in the package was noted, not enough to contact the company, no damage to the bottle noted. I would recommend using this product to add to lotions , body oil and natural cleaning products !!</li>
            <li> I purchased a number of oils from plant therapy that includes rosemary oil, glycerin, almond oil, castor oil... and they all arrived on time and in great condition. Also, they seem to be doing their job. I applied them on my natural hair just before twisting them and my hair still feels very nice and moisturized after one full week. I have not had the cause to reapply them. So this must be the deal, right?</li>
            <li> I like this essential oil as it does smell nice. I usually purchase doTerra essential oils as the quality is great, but it can be pricey for a reason. I&#x27;m using this essential oil in a mix of other essential oils I combine for a diffuser. This oil smells nice as a base and as long as the smell is good then I do not mind this quality for its price.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and good price.  I used this in conjunction with other essential oils to make beard balm and oil.</li>
            <li> I like the way this oil makes my skin feel.  It appears to be reducing the crease lines on my neck and leaves the skin silky smooth.</li>
            <li> It is what it claims to be.  Fast ship, reasonable price.  Smells wonderful and is doing what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Great Product.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> Rosemary essential oil was very helpful with my allergies.  Some perfumes and smells tend to bother me so I whip out my bottle of&lt;br /&gt;rosemary essential oil, take a sniff and I feel much better.  I wouldn&#x27;t be without it.</li>
            <li> I massage into my scalp a few times a week.  I love this stuff and it helps stimulate my hair growth, plus it&#x27;s smells great!</li>
            <li> I had an awesome experience when smelling the essence of the organice rosemary essential oil from Plant Therapy. This by far out weights all other oils I have smelled; which have been a few.  There is such a pureness to the smell and a very illuminating satisfaction of its properties. I use it in my hair but I also smell it for a relaxing moment as needed.</li>
            <li> I mix this oil with either argan or coconut oil and apply it to my scalp.  It tingles and feels good.  I don&#x27;t know if it will encourage hair growth but I like the feel of it on my scalp.</li>
            <li> Love this, smells great and I love using it in my bath. Would order this again. This product is exactly what the description states.</li>
            <li> Bought this to grow hair lol. Well yes 10 drops in 16oz of shampoo over time seems to work. Look nothing grows hair on a billard ball but I do see an improvement after 2 weeks of use. Subtle to be sure.</li>
            <li> Organic essential oils are hard to find and sometimes prohibitively expensive. But this one was not so expensive and is a very good product. I mix it with coconut for hair.</li>
            <li> High quality, will buy again!</li>
            <li> I oreder this ,got it very fast so far its been 3 to 4 month i m using it for my hair .it smells soo good so refreshing and def doing some good for my hair</li>
            <li> We bought this as an ingredient for a homemade copycat lip balm of Burt&#x27;s Bees. Worked perfectly! I would buy again.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with my product from Plant Therapy. They delivered and had exactly what I needed. I thought it would be hard to find but it wasn&#x27;t. Glad that Plant Therapy had exactly what I needed.  Very pleased with my Rosemary oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this rosemary oil would be good for a lot of uses but I only use essential oils for the purpose of enjoying the aromas in the air or on my body. In this reason, I don&#x27;t like the smell of rosemary...I won&#x27;t probably use this anymore.</li>
            <li> Good seller.  Product actually smelled minty</li>
            <li> I bought rosemary essential oil for hair growth.  I mixed a couple of drops into my hair shampoo.  My scalp seems cleaner and hair looks healthier than before.</li>
            <li> I really like Plant Therapy products. The rosemary is spicy-sweet and potent and I love to mix it with a carrier oil, like Argan, and use on my face and neck. It is good for the skin.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the quality of the oil and the quick service!</li>
            <li> It is nice to keep around during winter months when virus&#x27; are going around.</li>
            <li> I used this rosemary essential oil to scent homemade conditioner - it smells wonderful and will go a long way.</li>
            <li> Thanks PT, I love your EO&#x27;s or at least the ones that I&#x27;ve had the privilege of experiencing.  I use this one a lot, and love it!</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful!!  Couldn&#x27;t ask for a better deal..</li>
            <li> This was my very first time having rosemary oil and I must say it smells wonderful. This rosemary oil is extremely potent and a little goes a long way. I initially bought it for my hair just as an experiment to see if it actually works, but before I even tried it I just opened the bottle to sniff it for the first couple of days. When you sniff this oil it serves as a quick pick-me-up or energy booster....it smells just that good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh yeah, and as far as a little going a long way....when I did use it in my hair the smell lasted for about 5 days strong if not more.</li>
            <li> Plant Therapy has awesome products and service! :) This rosemary oil is wonderful and will last me a long time :) It keeps my scalp nice and healthy, and it&#x27;s has great aromatherapy properties that help soothe the senses in these stressful times. The seller is really kind and caring,and the lovely organic rosemary oil was shipped really fast :) Peace and Thank you so much :)    Edit to add 2/21/2015 :  I have been using this wonderful rosemary essential oil mixed with jojoba oil on ringworm on my hands and arms, and together with washing with a zinc pyrithione dandruff shampoo,my  ringworm is finally dying and my skin is healing too! :)  Thank you Thank you! :)  Peace :)</li>
            <li> This rosemary essential oil is of high quality. My soap turned out great using this oil.</li>
            <li> Will order more Rosemary it helps open us my sinuses and also use in a my bath to help me relax...</li>
            <li> This is my favorite fragrance to add to lotion. The ONE fragrance that I&#x27;ve found that both my husband and my cats like. LOL</li>
            <li> Geat product. Great price.</li>
            <li> I bought it because I read that the smell of rosemary increases memory for up to 75%. I use it to study and for tests, but it&#x27;s a great add to your scent mix in your oil diffuser. Just one drop, though! It&#x27;s quite overbearing and will hide the other scents. A tad minty, but with an herbal twist. Sometimes I put a little on the tip of my nose before taking a test. It relaxes me.</li>
            <li> Taste very positive, I put it to join two drops in shampoo, but are also good.</li>
            <li> This it helps me study, maintain concentration, and when the kids get crazy a few inhales of this helps to calm my brain.</li>
            <li> I would buy this oil again. Quick shipment from seller. It will take some time to see how effective the oil is, but so far, so good.</li>
            <li> I use this in an infuser as a way to clear my sinuses and it works great.  It can be used for other things as well for example you can buy shey butter and mix it in (small quantities) and some other oil like grape-seed, and use it on your chest as an expectorant, or a nice hand lotion.  I like the smell even though it&#x27;s strong.</li>
            <li> I used this in my hair to help treat flaking skin. Works ok the natural way! Good smell too even for a guy.</li>
            <li> I had breakage in the top of my hair...A few drops of rosemary oil mixed win another essential works wonders!</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I wanted!  I am using it as a homeopathic remedy for soreness from a hip replacement and to try and get a wound to heal on my foot.  So far, it&#x27;s doing the job.</li>
            <li> I love the scent of rosemary, I use it in my soaps</li>
            <li> it really is 100% pure, was skeptical at first but i love it now. You wont regret this purchase :)</li>
            <li> I used this product combined with sage oil and a bit of lavender oil to make a linen spray, which I love.  Currently the  rosemary bottle is in a kitchen cabinet waiting until I make the next batch, but meanwhile, every time I open the cabinet door I get a wonderful whiff of its scent.  Love it.</li>
            <li> The products was exactly what it was supposed to be!  I bought it (and other products) to make homemade bug spray. It worked great!</li>
            <li> Wonderful authentic scent.  Doesn&#x27;t smell overpowering or like medicine.  I have mixed it with other EO&#x27;s to make a &amp;#34;germ killer&amp;#34; spray as well as putting it in bath water for my 3 year old son.  Lots of healing properties.  So glad there is an affordable EO company out there!</li>
            <li> Great product, great price</li>
            <li> smells like Rosemary ;)</li>
            <li> Top quality. I use this for acne along with lavender and chamomile. This has been working for me as it reduces redness, kills bacteria, and has faster healing time.</li>
            <li> This seems to be a great product , and was quick to arrive, I would order again.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product as I&#x27;ve heard Rosemary can help with thinning hair due to PCOS. I most likley applied too much each time I used it, but I loved the way it tingles.</li>
            <li> Very strong soothing relaxing scent just as I wanted!</li>
            <li> This is definitely true rosemary oil. This works wonders on hair, and smells nice when paired with things like lemon. I use it to treat my hair and also to make the scent a bit more pleasant. Rosemary makes a great feeling leg rub too. I&#x27;m very pleased with this product&#x27;s price point, and the fact  that it does seem to be a good essential oil.</li>
            <li> I love the rosemary and its great benefits, this is my first time trying rosemary oil, I use it for my hair for strengthening the hair follicles/roots, I didnt notice a huge difference in strength, but my hair was dyed previously before use. But I must say it is a great therapy oil. I sniff it in both nostrils each, then at the same time, and I know by doing this I will be having a bowel movement. So it is great for weight loss, and relaxation. I looked everywhere and this was the best I could find so far. But it is an excellent oil, I was a little disappointed at the size at first, but I considered it is pretty standard for the quality, and price is not bad at all.</li>
            <li> I  have great hopes that it will help my hair regain its full vigor once again. Thank youfor the quick turn around and careful packaging.</li>
            <li> Love it.&lt;br /&gt;Opens up my airways and is very refreshing. I will purchase more when I run out but the bottle will last awhile so the price is great!</li>
            <li> I gave this product a 5 star rating because of the service I received.  I feel it&#x27;s to soon to make a decision on how the product works for me, but I feel confident that it will work.  I have no doubts, just need more time.</li>
            <li> I just received my second order of the Organic Rosemary Oil. I absolutely love it. I got the product on time and have been using it for the last two months. I apply a couple of drops every night on my hair. The smell is great and is makes hair stronger and helps with its growth. I also add it to other organic oils or hair masks for the same effect. Great product for its price and simple to use.</li>
            <li> I Like it, its very relax, good very good...................I like it, very nice, I like it, good, very good ;)</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product, it has an amazing smell to it.  You can tell this product is of high Quality Standard.</li>
            <li> This was the first time buying Organic Rosemary Oil and I am so pleased!! I placed several drops into almond oil and use it for a facial oil every night. What a wonderful scent!!! My skin looks so soft and smooth! I also put a few drops into my finger tips and massage into my scalp after I take a shower. It&#x27;s definitely a treat!!</li>
            <li> The product is of excellent quality and it has definitely worked for what I bought it for.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend it.</li>
            <li> it got here fast and packaged nicely except that  a portion of it was gone upon receipt. It was very cold that week.  so I assumed the oil got very cold during delivery which cause the oil to leak out and all over the inside of the packaging. But the product is serving its purpose. so I am ok with it.</li>
            <li> Excellent!!! I absolutely love this product.  I am hooked.  I mix this Rosemary with either coconut oil or almond oil and I use to rub my muscles when they are sore or just occasional aches.  The rosemary resell does eliminate arthritis in your hand, lower backaches and I even stiff it to calm me and I rub it on my temples when i have a headache and It Works!!!!  I highly recommend this product and don&#x27;t forget to mix or dulute with a carrier oil, lotion, etc.</li>
            <li> Works great for my hair loss. I use in the shower once to twice a week. I use about three drops and scrub into scalp.&lt;br /&gt;Leave for five mins and wash. I don&#x27;t use conditioner except for on the ends of my hair. I also do an aloe vera treatment to my scalp and hair once to twice a week. ( do not combine with oil will cause your hair to be extremely oily ) I recommend separate treatments. As well look into what vitamins you are taking. I am a 20 yr old female that began losing her hair at 18 due to a nutrition deficiency, combined with an immune disease my body started using the nutrition in my hair to help receive what it needed :( So trust me I have tried everything and now created my own little regime that has personally worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Listen up to know more!&lt;br /&gt;I eat right, and treat myself to the unhealthy food occasionally!&lt;br /&gt;Exercise every day even if its 30 mins a day. (blood circulates at the scalp when you get it going!)&lt;br /&gt;Vitamins! I take Black currant oil, Country hair maxi life, iron, biotin, and vitamin E to achieve a staple for working on the inside of my body for hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;My hair has grown almost 5inches total in 6months. Doesn&#x27;t sound like much to some, but I have worked so hard to achieve this result and cant wait to have my hair at my desired length! Don&#x27;t give up, just takes some patience!</li>
            <li> This is my first time purchasing an essential oil so I have nothing to compare it to. That said, I&#x27;m really liking it. It came with a booklet on uses for essential oils which was useful. I didn&#x27;t rate it 5 stars because the pourer thingy makes it hard to get a single contained drop the way a dropper would. Not a biggie unless you really need exact amounts.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I read this would help grow the hair and help with dry itchy, scalp. I don&#x27;t have a problem growing my hair on my own. It&#x27;s already pretty thick and long, but I have really dry scalp and I wanted to see if it would work. I use after every hair wash, so every once or twice a week. I apply is directly to my scalp while my hair is still damp, then I dry and style my hair.  I don&#x27;t apply everywhere on my scalp because the smell can be overwhelming at times, just mostly where my scalp is the itchiest or driest. About two weeks later, I noticed my scalp wasn&#x27;t dry or itchy as it once been. About a month later, my hair was an inch or two longer. So it does wonders for the hair. Once I&#x27;ve seen results, I don&#x27;t use after every hair, just every other wash. I would definitely recommend this is you&#x27;re having trouble growing your hair or if you have a really bad dry scalp.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use this oil yet but know from close friends I will be glad I have it.  I received great service and very quick delivery.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be going to sallys for mine from now on. They snag and pull and if you have super thick natural curly hair like mine (I am African American) then you may be in for a bit of a wrestle. Sallys has better.</li>
            <li> Arrived earlier than expected.  Securely packaged.  LOVE the scent!  It already has brightened my mood.  I can&#x27;t wait to begin using it!  As others have commented, I will try it for hair and aromatherapy to keep me focused for my studies.</li>
            <li> I use rosemary oil on my joints. It helps me get through the day. The product is as exactly what the seller described. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase of this product.</li>
            <li> People walk into my house and say, &amp;#34;something smells good, what&#x27;ya cooking?&amp;#34;  I was worried Rosemary would smell flowery, but it&#x27;s not a flowery smell. It&#x27;s a good homey comfort smell, sort of like someone&#x27;s cooking something real good for supper tonight. Love it!</li>
            <li> kills any weird stuff on skin...warts, pre-cancerous lesions, dandruff...at least it works for me...Oh, and I put a few drops in a sprayer bottle with water and used it to get rid of ants in my kitchen. I like the smell (this oil is STRONG) but the ants sure hate it!</li>
            <li> great quality use it for perfumes and in my hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s workon for my hair because I use more than just this on my hair. I do see some progress in the growth of my hair where the follicles have died. Love this oil!</li>
            <li> The oil is great and I already see a difference after a month of use.  It is hard to see the impact on the hair but I was losing hair for a long time and right after starting using the rosemary oil I noticed that I have minimum hair left on my brush every day.  This is very encouraging.  Seeing my hair grow will take time because the process is very slow but not losing hair is already great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is very pleasant and not heavy at all.  If you put too many drops you might feel heavy and saturated.  I didn&#x27;t have it in this case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is dark which is necessary for keeping the quality of essential oils so that is a good thing.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 stars is that the bottle is shipped in a bubble wrap and there is no packaging which help preventing light from going through.  I have an extensive selection of essential oils which high medicinal properties.  They all come in some kind of a packaging. Now, every time I open the drawer, this little bottle is exposed to the light (even though the bottle is dark).  My suggestion, add 2 cents to the price and put it in a mini package.</li>
            <li> I tried many products for the essential oil and finally met Plant Therapy - really organic and powerful. Thank You. Also the delivery was good and in time.</li>
            <li> works great for the hair, I put in in a protien spray...just a  couple of drops is all that is needed</li>
            <li> i really am liking this company for their oils seem to be great quality. I&#x27;ve used aura cacia and still love them but plant therapy i am really liking as well</li>
            <li> This rosemary oil is exactly what I needed. I apply two drops of oil to my palms and distribute it through my hair at night, and it has made an enormous difference in how healthy, and most notably how shiny my hair is. Great product at a great price. A little goes a long way so use sparingly.</li>
            <li> Fast,friendly, and does what I needed it for.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product and the smell is very pleasant, as well. I will definitely purchase it again.</li>
            <li> i used way too fast. wished it were bigger, but it was worth the buy.</li>
            <li> Perfect. Strong and organic. Its thick thats not diluted with other oils. I will buy again. thank you</li>
            <li> I will order all my oils from Plant Therapy from now on....truth!</li>
            <li> Hasn&#x27;t helped my memory yet but  I will give it time.</li>
            <li> Smells great and is everything that one would expect from an essential oil. The fact that it is organic is a nice bonus too.</li>
            <li> I received the product in satifactory condition and was very pleased with the scent and strength of the rosemary oil. I used the product to improve hair growth. It&#x27;s a very  good product and I&#x27;m glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite essential oil! I use this with Jojoba oil on my scalp and it really accelerates hair growth and health. I also inhale this daily, it really wakes you up.</li>
            <li> Been using for a week hopefully it will help with the hair growth. Mixing it into my conditioner because it does state not to use full strength. Odor a little string but will deal with it if it works</li>
            <li> But too small for something I need to use on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> Does not like the smell.</li>
            <li> A very clean refreshing scent. I saw that a user with &#x27;natural&#x27; hair puts it on her scalp so I tried that. It gave my hair a clean, fresh scent.</li>
            <li> I got this to put on my scalp to get rid of itching.  It took care of the problem. It is also energizing.  I mix  five or six drops with argan oil.  I really like it.</li>
            <li> You can never have enough Rosemary. It is good for concentration and so many other things.  Plant Therapy has the best essential oils.</li>
            <li> This was my first venture into essential oils.  In reading information on multiple sites, I knew to go organic, pure therapeutic grade and the type of bottle it should come in to protect the oils.  I ALWAYS go to Amazon first.  ALWAYS.  I have found comfort in shopping various merchants through Amazon and I have found no exception here.  The product was delivered in a timely manner, before promised and in a package that protected to oils but was not overkill.  I love the Rosemary and have used it in a hair moisturizer I tried and am very pleased.  Overall, I would purchase from this seller again.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome. A bargain compared to what the retail stores are selling it for and I have seen great results ever since I started using it.</li>
            <li> Great deal &amp; price. I got this to help my grand-daughter with cradle cap. Just add a few drops to her conditioning shampoo. Her scalp is much healthier now!</li>
            <li> Great product.  Smells great.  Haven&#x27;t got to use it much yet, but I read that it was suppose to help keep insects away.  I make my own bug spray.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great. I love the smell of Rosemary! It makes nice body scrub or candle scents. Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> I just started using essential oils and I now like the smell of this (I use it for my hair treatment).  At first I found it to be too strong but now I buy shampoos and conditioners that have rosemary oil in them as well.</li>
            <li> I bought this to mix with my coconut oil. It has the most pleasing aroma and I really like the results.</li>
            <li> it is good for what I am using it for.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> A great scent to combine with other smells.</li>
            <li> It smells Great! It is a good price as well.</li>
            <li> smell was harsh and not to my liking</li>
            <li> I love this oil,  it works wonders for adding exceptional shine and luster to my dark hair! Not for blondes but fabulous for brunettes!! I mix it with other base oils and run my fingers through my dry hair and it makes for smooth shiny hair! No chemicals on this head of hair!!!</li>
            <li> I ordered Rosemary but a bottle of lavender came. However, it smells like a mixture of Rosemary AND Lavender. I&#x27;m confused as to what I actually got. Product came on time and wrapped well, though.</li>
            <li> This rosemary essential oils smells wonderful.  I used it in some body wash that I made for my husband (peppermint, rosemary, tea tree scent) and he loves it.  It&#x27;s so invigorating and fresh!  I will definitely be buying more oils from Plant Therapy!</li>
