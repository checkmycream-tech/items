            <li>I recommend it if you like smooth scents.</li>
            <li>It is light and fresh.</li>
            <li>This has been my go to scent for more than 10 years and it has earned me much compliments from friends and strangers alike.</li>
            <li>It smells so flowery without the over powering flower smell, almost a light fresh flower smell.</li>
            <li>It is so fresh and clean and indescribable.</li>
            <li>and I thought about it the whole trip and made the purchase at a duty free store at the airport.</li>
            <li>Oriental, fresh, and just everything that I like in a fragrance.</li>
            <li>FRESH</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t stop buying it because it&#x27;s so refreshing and light for daily use.</li>
            <li>It is fresh, light, young, PER-FECT&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t change because I&#x27;ve had it since my daughter&#x27;s birth</li>
            <li>I first smelled this fragrance when I went on my trip to France.</li>
            <li>I smelled it in a dept store when I first got there</li>
            <li>I was looking for this parfum for many year and at last I found</li>
            <li>I got this perfume for the first time in 2000.</li>
            <li>My father first bought me this perfume when 10yrs ago when I was a teenager.</li>
            <li>Amazon has the lowest prices I found so far beyond the duty free shops on the airports.</li>
            <li>The first time, what I ordered came, plus a bonus moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>so I thought maybe because it&#x27;s new that it lettering is bold and sharp.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was apprehensive as I wasn&#x27;t sure if this is the real deal as the price is much lower than what you would get from the retail stores such as Sephora, but it is!</li>
            <li>Pure alcohol.  </li>
            <li>No matter how much I put it on</li>
            <li>price is affordable and I think you really like this fragrance.....</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;and still likes it very much&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really a lovely scent, but scent is so subjective, I will concentrate on the item meeting my expectations based on previous purchases from Saks.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;it is slightly different from the original (old or vintage one)&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li>I just can&#x27;t get over that it smells like Elizabeth Arden sunflowers, which reminds me too much of junior high in the early 90&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>So far it is not giving me a headache, which I am very prone to with perfumes, esp those containing musk.</li>
            <li>I did notice many years back that the scent had slightly changed from my original bottle that I actually bought in Europe.  </li>
            <li>and I cannot shake the suspicion that since the new bottle they also made some changes to the scent.</li>
            <li>This Eau De Toilette is not as common as many and is a real find.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very soft.</li>
            <li>I had a family member bring me a European bottle and that bottle&#x27;s fragrance was slightly different from my original as well.  </li>
            <li>and it was the exact same scent.  </li>
            <li>I just sprayed from my old bottle(1 mist)</li>
            <li>Soft floral notes, never over empowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, I miss an old bottle design</li>
            <li>No complains so far.</li>
            <li>This perfume has such a different, distinct scent.</li>
            <li>Terrific, long lasting, light and feminine.</li>
            <li>buy this here but purchase them at sephora or other retail stores though it maybe costly but worth it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;this bottle had some what bold lettering of the L&#x27;eau par Kenzo than my previous bottle</li>
            <li>I can barely smell it.  </li>
            <li>This bottle of L&#x27;eau par Kenzo was twice as large for less money</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I am using this perfumes for at least 10 years.</li>
            <li> It is a very delicate:  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a compete fake.  </li>
            <li> I am really disappointed because you can&#x27;t even return perfume because it is flammable.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have been wearing this perfume for over a decade!  I did notice many years back that the scent had slightly changed from my original bottle that I actually bought in Europe.  I had a family member bring me a European bottle and that bottle&#x27;s fragrance was slightly different from my original as well.  It is the perfect perfume for me.  It wears great, gives me no headaches, and I always get complements on the scent.</li>
            <li> I first smelled this fragrance when I went on my trip to France. I smelled it in a dept store when I first got there and I thought about it the whole trip and made the purchase at a duty free store at the airport. It smells really light, elegant and clean.</li>
            <li> This product, L&#x27;eau Par Kenzo has to be my favorite of all colognes. About 5 years ago my daughter brought me a bottle from London and I have looked and searched to no avail. I was just browsing on the net and could not believe that it was listed on Amazon.com. I had saved the empty bottle and immediately searched the info. and I guess that was my Christmas present this year to myself. This perfume has such a different, distinct scent. Oriental, fresh, and just everything that I like in a fragrance.</li>
            <li> Well, I have used 2 bottles altogether now.&lt;br /&gt;and I bought it again cuz I love the scent.&lt;br /&gt;However, this one the box packaging looked okay but when I saw the glass bottle I should have doubted more.&lt;br /&gt;this bottle had some what bold lettering of the L&#x27;eau par Kenzo than my previous bottle so I thought maybe because it&#x27;s new that it lettering is bold and sharp.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for two weeks now. No matter how much I put it on I can barely smell it.  Before I only used 3 mists or 4 sometimes and it lasted all day.&lt;br /&gt;Finally this morning I concluded that this perfume is not authentic Kenzo product but fake one(I put tons of perfume all over me and on my cloth and after 4 hrs I can barely think that I used them on.  I just sprayed from my old bottle(1 mist) that had some left over and the scent is stronger.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy this here but purchase them at sephora or other retail stores though it maybe costly but worth it.</li>
            <li> Very good quality of product.</li>
            <li> I was looking for this parfum for many year and at last I found it.&lt;br /&gt;I am super happy with the aroma and fragance.&lt;br /&gt;The price was also great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for a great service.</li>
            <li> I got this perfume for the first time in 2000. And still, I cannot get over it. It is light and fresh. It makes you feel great! I think the fragrance is very unique and unforgettable.</li>
            <li> My father first bought me this perfume when 10yrs ago when I was a teenager. I fell in love with this fragrance then. I am so glad I found it here. Fragrance is nice flowery and not too strong. I recommend this to anyone who likes nice light perfumes.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite fragrance ever. It&#x27;s been years since I have this perfume as my top one.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s fresh, not too strong, pleasant. To be used on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a compete fake.  The box cover was all scratched on the inside and there is literally no fragrance to stuff.  Pure alcohol.  What a shame, I thought I thought since it&#x27;s fulfilled by Amazon, I am protected.  Go figure!</li>
            <li> I like this perfum. This is the second that I have. It&#x27;s very soft. I recommend it if you like smooth scents.</li>
            <li> I like this parfum. This is the second that I have. It&#x27;s very soft. I recommend it if you like smooth scents.</li>
            <li> She likes it, not much more I can say. I bought it on orders from the wife, and she happy. She&#x27;s happy......&amp;#34;I&#x27;m happy&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This has been my go to scent for more than 10 years and it has earned me much compliments from friends and strangers alike. Soft floral notes, never over empowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was apprehensive as I wasn&#x27;t sure if this is the real deal as the price is much lower than what you would get from the retail stores such as Sephora, but it is!</li>
            <li> I just received my L&#x27;eau Par Kenzo and it is a very nice, light, unobtrusive perfume.  So far it is not giving me a headache, which I am very prone to with perfumes, esp those containing musk. The bottle is nice and it sprays great.  I just can&#x27;t get over that it smells like Elizabeth Arden sunflowers, which reminds me too much of junior high in the early 90&#x27;s.  This should be a nice light day fragrance but I&#x27;m still searching for my signature scent. I guess it&#x27;s time to actually go to a store and smell some perfumes, but you just can&#x27;t beat the convenience and prices on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It is my favorite....FRESH I RECOMMEND THIS PERFUM TO ALL AGES,&lt;br /&gt;The price is affordable and I think you really like this fragrance.....</li>
            <li> I love this perfume, smellls just like the way I remember, it arrive on time and excellent conditions, definitely  I recommend this product</li>
            <li> I am using this perfumes for at least 10 years. I love them! However, I miss an old bottle design and I cannot shake the suspicion that since the new bottle they also made some changes to the scent. Anyway, scent is fantastic! Amazon has the lowest prices I found so far beyond the duty free shops on the airports.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance for every day. It is so fresh and clean and indescribable. It isn&#x27;t very strong so someone would have to be close to you to smell it. But once they give you a hug or come close it is very nice. I have never had anyone say they didn&#x27;t like it or thought it stunk. I get headaches very easy from perfumes and I will get it from this if I spray it on my neck under my face/nose but it wears off after about an hour or two. I usually have to spray everything on my neck under my ears. Very happy with purchase. will buy again.</li>
            <li> Good product, my wife loves it.</li>
            <li> my wife uses it since 1998&lt;br /&gt;and still likes it very much&lt;br /&gt;it is slightly different from the original (old or vintage one)&lt;br /&gt;but that one is hard to come by&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller is good , price fair, delivery fast.</li>
            <li> It is a very delicate:  The smell is so clean, so fresh and yet kind of exotic.  I really love it.  I keep buying it since I found it about 10 years ago.</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd time I ordered this from the same company.  The first time, what I ordered came, plus a bonus moisturizer.  So, I ordered again from here 9 mos later.  Instead of the eau de toilette, they sent what is labeled vaporisator.  Unfortunately, the 2nd bottle is mostly alcohol, so the scent does not last, and has evaporated away in a few hrs.  It does not last all day like the eau de toilette.  I am really disappointed because you can&#x27;t even return perfume because it is flammable.</li>
            <li> I bought it for a coworker. She liked it a lot because has a good fragrance and doesn&#x27;t bothers people around, because the odor is nice and soft.</li>
            <li> Excellent essence. Although it is Eau De toilet, its essence stays during all day long without losing its properties. I recommend!</li>
            <li> Everything as advertised. Even reached at destination one day in advance. Bought it for my wife as a present and never dissapoints. No complains so far.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of Flowers by Kenzo, and this smelled absolutely wonderful!  It smells so flowery without the over powering flower smell, almost a light fresh flower smell.</li>
            <li> Terrific, long lasting, light and feminine. This Eau De Toilette is not as common as many and is a real find.</li>
            <li> The product was for me and I will refer to family and friends, beacuse it is good to have on hand.</li>
            <li> This perfume is perfect for the summertime.  It has a clean and refreshing scent.  I dont get as many compliments as when I wear Hanae Mori.  But I dont wear the perfume for compliments, I wear it for me.</li>
            <li> It is fresh, light, young, PER-FECT&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t change because I&#x27;ve had it since my daughter&#x27;s birth and she&#x27;s &amp;#34;addicted&amp;#34; :)</li>
            <li> im so glad i found it online. it is pretty expensive at stores and its hard to find. i love the smell of it. I use it for about 4 months now and everyone is asking the name of my perfume.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife and she loves it.  I like the way it smells on her and would purchase more</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really a lovely scent, but scent is so subjective, I will concentrate on the item meeting my expectations based on previous purchases from Saks.  This bottle of L&#x27;eau par Kenzo was twice as large for less money and it was the exact same scent.  Perfection.</li>
            <li> Love this wish the scent lasted longer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the perfume for years and I can&#x27;t stop buying it because it&#x27;s so refreshing and light for daily use.</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume. I love it.</li>
            <li> This is my most favorite scent, every time I wear it I get compliments; and that doesn&#x27;t happen with most colognes or perfumes. Others do not agree with my chemistry.</li>
