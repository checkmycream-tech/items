    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>An excellent product.</li>
            <li>JUST LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li>This non aluminum deodorant is very good.</li>
            <li>wonderful product, can&#x27;t use antiperspirants, and this deodorant works great.</li>
            <li>Nice smell, and works great!</li>
            <li>It worked great.</li>
            <li>A good product.</li>
            <li>For the price, it&#x27;s a good deal, just be prepared to sniff and go what?</li>
            <li>Spring Fresh and Summer Spice are the best scents.</li>
            <li>Also, it seems to works better at times than others, but I believe that speaks of my own body chemistry than of the product itself.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of natural deodorants, and the Nature&#x27;s Gate brand continues to be the best.</li>
            <li>Very pleasant scent, not feminine or masculine,  would work for both.</li>
            <li>Better than kiss my face.</li>
            <li>80-90 degree weather it is doing the job well.&lt;br /&gt;Falling in love with this brand.</li>
            <li>Love the scent and no skin irritation</li>
            <li>However, the flowery smell goes away relatively quickly, and the ingredients block odors quite effectively.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s non GMO and aluminum free and has a fresh,clean scent.</li>
            <li>It still works great for me though, and I will definitely keep purchasing this product.</li>
            <li>Best deodorant that works if you don&#x27;t want a daily dose of aluminum absorbing into your body.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried lots of natural deodorants and this is hands down the best that I&#x27;ve found commercially available.</li>
            <li>The product is pretty good but only lasts about 4 hours before needing reapplication</li>
            <li>this new formula does not and it does not smell as good or work as well as the old formula.</li>
            <li>They shared the brown colored bar like the Spring Fresh sticks I got at a store.</li>
            <li>I love that their are no harsh chemicals</li>
            <li>I also love that it goes on clear</li>
            <li>Its kinda like powder fresh</li>
            <li>Fresh scent, and a container lasts me a l-o-n-g time.</li>
            <li>my absolute fave--just smells like a hint of sandalwood/patchouli, smells natural and really nice, almost like perfume.</li>
            <li>I broke out in a rash right after I started using it.</li>
            <li>Spring Fresh has been about the only brand I&#x27;ve been able to use consistently without any problem.</li>
            <li>The scent has been reformulated since I first started using this type.</li>
            <li>When this arrived the first thing I noticed was that they&#x27;d changed the formula.</li>
            <li>It happened with this new version of Spring Fresh, too.</li>
            <li>The only aluminum - free product that works for me.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery and product as described.</li>
            <li>Very please.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not an anti-perspirant, but it&#x27;s much healthier.</li>
            <li>The scent is very soft and it covers body odor very well!</li>
            <li>I spent many weeks and dollars searching for a deo that would live up to its claims  </li>
            <li>Decent deodorant but caused a rash.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased this type of deodorant stick (Spring Fresh) at a local health store and the bar had a brown hue.</li>
            <li>Have tried various non-aluminum deodorants and this one is the only one that worked and also didn&#x27;t easily melt.</li>
            <li>I actually bought a couple of the roll-ons out of desperation because most other brands cause me to break out in a rash.</li>
            <li>I guess I have very sensitive skin, and it especially reacts to certain chemicals.</li>
            <li>My health conscious girlfriend tried this</li>
            <li>husband uses the Summer version which is like old spice.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li>the old formula had witch hazel in it...</li>
            <li>Everyone&#x27;s chemistry is different so it may not work for some with heavier B.O., but it works really well for me.</li>
            <li>Luckily they don&#x27;t bother my wife&#x27;s armpits so my money has not been wasted.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten the Winter Clean deodorant sticks that are unscented in the past and had no problem with them.</li>
            <li>this stuff smells like clean laundry and makes your delicate armpit skin soft without drying it out.  </li>
            <li>They never turn sour or smell funny on my clothes.</li>
            <li>Really too bad because I liked it a lot.</li>
            <li>It is worth noting that I usually reapply in the morning (I shower at night).</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My health conscious girlfriend tried this and it did not work.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon did refund me though!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this type of deodorant stick (Spring Fresh) at a local health store and the bar had a brown hue. The sticks I received in this purchase are white and they do not agree with my skin. I get rashes on both of my arm pits and had to quit using them. Luckily they don&#x27;t bother my wife&#x27;s armpits so my money has not been wasted. But I&#x27;m reviewing this product so the two stars stand. I like the Nature&#x27;s Gate brand. I&#x27;ve gotten the Winter Clean deodorant sticks that are unscented in the past and had no problem with them. They shared the brown colored bar like the Spring Fresh sticks I got at a store. Wish they still carried them at the store...</li>
            <li> The scent has been reformulated since I first started using this type. That was disappointing since I really liked the previous scent.</li>
            <li> The product is pretty good but only lasts about 4 hours before needing reapplication</li>
            <li> Decent deodorant but caused a rash. Discontinued use.</li>
            <li> I have been purchasing this deodorant for years at my local health store. For some reason the store discontinued the stick, though they still have the roll-on. I actually bought a couple of the roll-ons out of desperation because most other brands cause me to break out in a rash. I guess I have very sensitive skin, and it especially reacts to certain chemicals. Spring Fresh has been about the only brand I&#x27;ve been able to use consistently without any problem. When this arrived the first thing I noticed was that they&#x27;d changed the formula. It looks and feels very similar to Tom&#x27;s brand, which I had reactions to when I used it. It happened with this new version of Spring Fresh, too. I broke out in a rash right after I started using it. I don&#x27;t know why they changed the formula, but what they have now doesn&#x27;t work for me. I&#x27;m back to using the roll on that the local health store has until I can find another brand that will work for me.</li>
            <li> Nice smell, and works great!</li>
            <li> The only aluminum - free product that works for me. I spent many weeks and dollars searching for a deo that would live up to its claims  (Toms, how are you still in business?); this one works!! It is worth noting that I usually reapply in the morning (I shower at night). Also, it seems to works better at times than others, but I believe that speaks of my own body chemistry than of the product itself. Very pleasant scent, not feminine or masculine,  would work for both.</li>
            <li> this stuff smells like clean laundry and makes your delicate armpit skin soft without drying it out.  JUST LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> I love that their are no harsh chemicals and it&#x27;s non GMO and aluminum free and has a fresh,clean scent. I also love that it goes on clear so their are no white streaks that would stain clothing.</li>
            <li> I saw reviews that said the formula had changed, and it did appear to be different. It still works great for me though, and I will definitely keep purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and product as described. Very please.</li>
            <li> Better than kiss my face. Its kinda like powder fresh scent.&lt;br /&gt;My husband uses the Summer version which is like old spice.&lt;br /&gt;In 80-90 degree weather it is doing the job well.&lt;br /&gt;Falling in love with this brand.</li>
            <li> This seems to be the all-natural deodorant that I&#x27;ve been looking for. The scent is very soft and it covers body odor very well!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of natural deodorants and this is hands down the best that I&#x27;ve found commercially available. I don&#x27;t stink!</li>
            <li> wonderful product, can&#x27;t use antiperspirants, and this deodorant works great.</li>
            <li> Stopped using salt crystal as my sodium levels increased according to blood test. This non aluminum deodorant is very good. After a few uses, it lasts me until the next day when I perform cleansing routine.</li>
            <li> I switched to natural deodorant in high school because the normal ones gave me a terrible rash. I have used this deodorant for over 10 years. I bought a case of it and just recently used it up. It worked great. But since the last time I bought it they changed the formula and now it gives me a rash. So I had to give this one up. Really too bad because I liked it a lot.</li>
            <li> Love the scent and no skin irritation</li>
            <li> Have tried various non-aluminum deodorants and this one is the only one that worked and also didn&#x27;t easily melt. A good product. Reapply during the day after sweating for maximum effect.</li>
            <li> I prefer to stay away from aluminum-based deodorants, and have used the Nature&#x27;s Gate for years. Recently, I tried a couple of other brands and just found them to be lacking in staying power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Going back to the Nature&#x27;s Gate.</li>
            <li> the old formula had witch hazel in it...this new formula does not and it does not smell as good or work as well as the old formula. VERY disappointed.</li>
            <li> Best deodorant that works if you don&#x27;t want a daily dose of aluminum absorbing into your body.</li>
            <li> Fresh scent, and a container lasts me a l-o-n-g time. It&#x27;s not an anti-perspirant, but it&#x27;s much healthier. I&#x27;ve been using product this at least five years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of natural deodorants, and the Nature&#x27;s Gate brand continues to be the best. Spring Fresh and Summer Spice are the best scents. They never turn sour or smell funny on my clothes. Especially Summer Spice--my absolute fave--just smells like a hint of sandalwood/patchouli, smells natural and really nice, almost like perfume. Everyone&#x27;s chemistry is different so it may not work for some with heavier B.O., but it works really well for me.</li>
            <li> A little too flowery for my tastes - as a guy, if I had smelled it in person, I definitely wouldn&#x27;t have purchased it. However, the flowery smell goes away relatively quickly, and the ingredients block odors quite effectively. For the price, it&#x27;s a good deal, just be prepared to sniff and go what?</li>
            <li> An excellent product.</li>
            <li> Quality product, nothing bad to say about it</li>
