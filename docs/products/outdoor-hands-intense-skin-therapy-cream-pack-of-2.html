            <li>Good stuff, at least the best I&#x27;ve found</li>
            <li>Does not leave my hands greasy, more of a silky smooth.</li>
            <li>I loved it so much I bought it for my brother.</li>
            <li>Price is fair &amp; reasonable.</li>
            <li>Not to strong and not over whelming like some of my wife&#x27;s lotions.</li>
            <li>Excellent for very dry hands!!!</li>
            <li>.. Wish it could be available.  </li>
            <li>am so excited I&#x27;m telling all my co-workers</li>
            <li>I have used this for over a month now and it quickly healed a cracked thumb and makes my hands feel smooth.  </li>
            <li>Stuff works great on very dry cracked hands.  </li>
            <li>product is great but found that Amazon&#x27;s price was higher than buying the same size pack at Tractor Supply.</li>
            <li>OUTDOOR HANDS healed them up quickly.  </li>
            <li>Was able to test this product out previously and loved it so much I had to buy it.  </li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>This cream really helps them heal quickly.</li>
            <li>A quick rub on the lips after rubbing it into the hands and your all ready to go.</li>
            <li>very fast healing</li>
            <li>I am amazed at how well this cream worked on the first application.  </li>
            <li>Awsome product, perfectly long lasting and feels great.</li>
            <li>It REALLY DOES WORK!</li>
            <li>When you first look at this and say $10 a tube you have to be kidding me.</li>
            <li>This product is the first that I have come across</li>
            <li>It was a eureka moment the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>While this lotion doesn&#x27;t cut through the skin any better than other lotions (I have resorted to trimming the hair on the back of my hands), I haven&#x27;t encountered any other lotion that drys/absorbs as fast as this or does as superb a job soothing and healing the cracking skin.</li>
            <li>Excellent quality and works very well when used daily...still find it hard to write long</li>
            <li>Both ladies have shared what amazing results they are seeing after using this product for just a few days.  </li>
            <li>My husband really finds this to be helpful.</li>
            <li>It really helps my cracked skin in the winter.</li>
            <li>Just a pea size amount does very well.</li>
            <li>It really works to help prevent chapped hands.</li>
            <li>Because it is made near me many local stores carry it.</li>
            <li>Blends right in and is completely invisible.</li>
            <li>It vanishes quickly but stays within the layers of your skin to keep them moist for several hours.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>really works great, especially in the winter on rough hands &amp; any other areas that are needed</li>
            <li>The only suggestion I would have to the makers of this product would be to make it available in a larger size tube/packaging.</li>
            <li>Helps heal dry and cracked skin fast!!  </li>
            <li>Now we both have baby soft feet.</li>
            <li>but so far i am underwhelmed</li>
            <li>My hands are soft and feel like velvet.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Wish this was around when my kids were young</li>
            <li>So far I haven&#x27;t had the problem this year.</li>
            <li>If I put this on every morning and evening, my hands stay reasonably soft (despite washing them often).  </li>
            <li>It sinks in right away and does not leave any oily residue.  </li>
            <li>My skin is super soft and much less wrinkly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve finally found a hand cream that quickly heals my cracked and sometimes bleeding dry hands.</li>
            <li>Perhaps worse is the caveman-like nature of the back of my hands, completely covered in hair making putting on any kind of lotion like trying to rub it into a towel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This really helps w/ dry hands.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t begin to imagine how much money between the two families that we have spent looking for products to help these two ladies with severe skin/hand issues.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it for anyone who has very dry chapped hands.</li>
            <li>It is thick but not greasy and absorbs quickly.</li>

            <li> I wash and use hand sanitizer all day  long.</li>

            <li> Expensive for mediocre results.</li>

            <li> very painful.  </li>

            <li> I use this product on my 50-year-old face every morning, and it is amazing. Blends right in and is completely invisible. My skin is super soft and much less wrinkly. I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s in it, but it works.</li>
            <li> this cream heals not only my hands but my feet.  I loved it so much I bought it for my brother. Now we both have baby soft feet.</li>
            <li> I really love this stuff!!  My finger tips get cracked and sore sometimes. This cream really helps them heal quickly.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t help my extra dry hands</li>
            <li> my husband has terrible cracked hands and this is the only product he likes.</li>
            <li> I love this hand cream.  I found it while visiting my dad in the hospital.  Once I put it on my hands I knew I had to have my own.  This is a good bargain.</li>
            <li> The best I&#x27;ve ever used for dry, cracked, sore fingertips.  Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Great product... I discovered it in Walgreens... But they soon discontinued sales of it, why I don&#x27;t know .. Wish it could be available.  I Love Outdoor Hands!!!!</li>
            <li> It got here late. Then it was just meh. It felt sticky after putting it on. I&#x27;ll keep using it but so far i am underwhelmed</li>
            <li> read the reviews and took a chance.  I&#x27;m a nurse and wash my hands a million times a day and dry doesn&#x27;t begin to describe the condition mine are in.  I am always searching for a hand cream to help even a little.  I am amazed at how well this cream worked on the first application.  I couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes.  The dryness just plain disappeared. My hands are soft and feel like velvet.&lt;br /&gt;I am so excited I&#x27;m telling all my co-workers and I&#x27;m buying a tube for them to try at work.  Oh and it&#x27;s now my leg cream and arm cream and I even put some on my lips.  I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> Awsome product, perfectly long lasting and feels great. The men in my family love it! The perfect thing for my son in college, he loves the smell. It&#x27;s a manly scent.</li>
            <li> My husband really finds this to be helpful. We&#x27;ll continue to purchase it here since we can&#x27;t seem to find it in our town.</li>
            <li> Helps heal dry and cracked skin fast!!  I am happy as a customer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;Deb C</li>
            <li> Wish this was around when my kids were young and I washed so many dishes!! My fingers always cracked and bled.  very painful.  I have used this for over a month now and it quickly healed a cracked thumb and makes my hands feel smooth.  Helps in these winter months!</li>
            <li> I have used this before and love it. It really helps my cracked skin in the winter. It is thick but not greasy and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> Stuff works great on very dry cracked hands.  Have tried others but this us the best without being greasy. Lasts in cold dry weather too.</li>
            <li> Outstanding product.  Skin was dry from chemotherapy treatments and this cream has worked the best of all I tried.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with this not what I was expecting</li>
            <li> Expensive for mediocre results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve finally found a hand cream that quickly heals my cracked and sometimes bleeding dry hands. It REALLY DOES WORK!</li>
            <li> When you first look at this and say $10 a tube you have to be kidding me. Well actions speak louder than words. I work with my hands in solvents and dish washing detergent. My hands get severly damaged. Just a pea size amount does very well. Does not leave my hands greasy, more of a silky smooth. The scent is nice.  Not to strong and not over whelming like some of my wife&#x27;s lotions. I promise this is the ONLY lotion I use.  Because it is made near me many local stores carry it. I keep one in the car, one by my bed and one in my gym bag.</li>
            <li> My hands suffer in the winter up here in NNY where it is dry and cold.  This product is the first that I have come across that helps heal the cracked skin and keeps it away.</li>
            <li> I use this myself &amp; have sold a bunch of it in my retail stores. really works great, especially in the winter on rough hands &amp; any other areas that are needed</li>
            <li> A family member had heard about \\&quot;Outdoor Hands\\&quot; but could not find it anywhere.  I found it here on Amazon for her and a friend who both have horrible skin issues with their hands.  Both ladies have shared what amazing results they are seeing after using this product for just a few days.  I can&#x27;t begin to imagine how much money between the two families that we have spent looking for products to help these two ladies with severe skin/hand issues.  I am anxious to see how their hands do over time.  The only suggestion I would have to the makers of this product would be to make it available in a larger size tube/packaging.</li>
            <li> The best hand cream ever! I suffered from split fingers and this hand cream was the only thing that worked. It has a great feeling and scent to it. It vanishes quickly but stays within the layers of your skin to keep them moist for several hours.</li>
            <li> This product works for me not greasy very fast healing it works overnight</li>
            <li> Winter is a terrible time to be my hands -- the cold, dry air combined with my proclivity to not wear gloves means my hands are constantly exposed to the elements and take a terrible beating. Perhaps worse is the caveman-like nature of the back of my hands, completely covered in hair making putting on any kind of lotion like trying to rub it into a towel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of the winter the skin on my hands will literally crack and bleed, which for several years I could only combat by putting on greasy lotion covered by rubber gloves to keep the moisturizer on my skin. While this lotion doesn&#x27;t cut through the skin any better than other lotions (I have resorted to trimming the hair on the back of my hands), I haven&#x27;t encountered any other lotion that drys/absorbs as fast as this or does as superb a job soothing and healing the cracking skin. It was a eureka moment the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> I work in harsh conditions on some projects, my hands take a beating and are always dry. With this product my wife will actually let me put my hands on her. Good stuff, at least the best I&#x27;ve found and I&#x27;ve tried a lot.</li>
            <li> Was able to test this product out previously and loved it so much I had to buy it.  Great for the hands and feet but it also works on moistening the lips.  A quick rub on the lips after rubbing it into the hands and your all ready to go.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality and works very well when used daily...still find it hard to write long replies,,,,makes me think of constipation of thught and diarrhea of words.....you will not  accepted I sure, but I have said this before...HOW MANY WORDS ARE NEEDED TO SAY IT WORKS WELL OR I LIKE IT.</li>
            <li> I bought a tube of this hand cream at a Home &amp; garden show last year. I love it and have purchased more of it. I have a problem with the tips of my thumbs splitting in the winter. So far I haven&#x27;t had the problem this year. I would highly recommend it for anyone who has very dry chapped hands.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of hand creams, and this was by far the best.  I am tired of watery lotions that moisturize my hands for only 5 minutes.  If I put this on every morning and evening, my hands stay reasonably soft (despite washing them often).  If I apply a few times throughout the day, I have baby-soft hands.</li>
            <li> product is great but found that Amazon&#x27;s price was higher than buying the same size pack at Tractor Supply.</li>
            <li> Excellent for very dry hands!!!</li>
            <li> Best dry skin product on the market....  Works great on my feet!!!</li>
            <li> lotion is provides great moisturizing affect without any greasiness.  I&#x27;ve used it on hands, knees, elbows and feet. works great. Price is fair &amp; reasonable.</li>
            <li> This is the only cream that has healed my dry, cracked hands.  I wash and use hand sanitizer all day  long. OUTDOOR HANDS healed them up quickly.  I now have all the nurses using it!  Best ever.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. I have small kids &amp; I am constantly washing my hands. This really helps w/ dry hands.</li>
            <li> I love this hand lotion.  It sinks in right away and does not leave any oily residue.  It really works to help prevent chapped hands.</li>
