            <li>This is the perfect choice.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always read wonderful things about Laura Mercier&#x27;s tinted moisturizer.</li>
            <li>This is the perfect tinted moisturizer and the best one I have ever tried.  </li>
            <li>If this is the case for you, Laura recommends mixing those two shades together to get the perfect, custom match.</li>
            <li>I like creating flawless look though people may recognize that I do have foundation on.  </li>
            <li>The name of this product is incredibly misleading.  </li>
            <li>good luck shopping!</li>
            <li>I have fair skin and use the nude which is just perfect for me....</li>
            <li>They work beautifully together.</li>
            <li>And it looks great.</li>
            <li>All in all, this is a great tinted moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I used to use heavier cream foundation that costs over $100 for that perfect sheen look, but now feels completely light but perfectly even.  </li>
            <li>:o)</li>
            <li>This glides over your skin easily and blends wonderfully.</li>
            <li>I have fair to light skin with neutral undertone, and Nude is the perfect color for me.</li>
            <li>This product moisturizes as well as provides good coverage.  </li>
            <li>I am returning the product and will continue my search for a good tinted moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It is good for my combination skin or in the summer and does not look greasy.</li>
            <li>FAIR skin tones or those who use Laura&#x27;s Foundation in colors Porcelain Ivory or Blush Ivory would use Tinted Moisturizer - PORCELAIN  -FAIR</li>
            <li>Tinted Moisturizer can be worn with or without Laura&#x27;s famous, award winning, and best selling Foundation Primer underneath.</li>
            <li>This moisturizing formula will hydrate, soften, and impart a very healthy looking glow to the skin.</li>
            <li>I use this tinted moisturizer along with loose powder for a perfect, flawless finish.  </li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t find a better tinted moisturizer out there!</li>
            <li>The SPF 20 is a nice added bonus too.</li>
            <li>I recommend this tinted moisturizer for anyone who wants to shorten their cosmetic routine, protect their skin and look great!</li>
            <li>SPF 20 is a nice addition to help protect the skin from both UVB rays as well as some UVA rays.</li>
            <li>I workout alot and this stuff doesn&#x27;t run or streak, which is nice when I need to wipe all the sweat off my face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fairly light-skinned and asian, but the nude is the perfect shade for me!</li>
            <li>If you want a natural look when your skin is thinning, this is so wonderful!</li>
            <li>Light coverage (as promised), good moisturizer,</li>
            <li>Most people just comment that my skin looks nice.</li>
            <li>I love tinted moisturizers, and this one is by far the best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great choice even for the Brazilian Summer climate (hot and humid).  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very light.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light and doesn&#x27;t make me feel like I have any makeup on.  </li>
            <li>I see that most of the positive reviewers here use it as a foundation, which is great, but it should be called a Foundation rather than a Moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I love the Laura Mercier tinted face cream.</li>
            <li>my skin looks so much better.  </li>
            <li>I am glad I did not ask for a refund.</li>
            <li>You might just do better purchasing a super-hydrating foundation and applying it lighter with a cosmetic sponge.     </li>
            <li>I am so glad I bought this.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for more coverage -- look elsewear.  </li>
            <li>but i really love this product.  </li>
            <li>and so I use this during the winter on top of my moisturizer, I don&#x27;t recommend using it alone.</li>
            <li>Would suit a more olive skin tone.  </li>
            <li>Warm Ivory would use Tinted Moisturizer - NUDE  -LIGHT</li>
            <li>Many of her clients do this.</li>
            <li>A sponge will help you apply the product more evenly than using your fingers.</li>
            <li>I love it and don&#x27;t know how I ever did without it.</li>
            <li>Better yet, buy two tubes and depending on your mood, apply accordingly.</li>
            <li>Perhaps the oil-free version works better, but this product was like applying paint.</li>
            <li>I read somewhere online that Sarah Jessica Parker attributes her healthy glow to the Nude shade of the Laura Mercier Tinted Moisturizer as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It worked well on keeping my rash area covered up with a more healthy look.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;nude\\&quot; is a much more neutral tone.  </li>
            <li>The coverage is light and it is very easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>While this product might not be good for someone who wants full coverage, it evens out skin tone nicely and removes any redness around the nose area.  </li>
            <li>so easy to apply</li>
            <li>I like this product because it&#x27;s easy to put on</li>
            <li>This is a great product for people who want a natural, dewy look with light coverage.  </li>
            <li>Easy to Use:  </li>
            <li>tube is easy to grasp with one hand and remove the twist-off cap in one twist.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for women who have good skin but just need to even things out or look \\&quot;awake\\&quot; before they head out for the day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, blends easily, stays put all day (with or without the foundation primer) and is not greasy at all.</li>
            <li>When I hit my 40s, my wonderful skin started to look a little less than wonderful.</li>
            <li>Then my sister-in-law mentioned that she is a huge Laura Mercier fan because of the Tinted Moisturizer... wouldn&#x27;t leave home without it.</li>
            <li>Application goes on smoothly and it wears well.</li>
            <li>Light and dewy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fantastic product.</li>
            <li>It works well with a light tan and warms up winter skin without being orange at all.  </li>
            <li>I have light asian/yellow complexion.</li>
            <li>but it provides light to medium coverage.</li>
            <li>TO LIGHT skin tones or those who use Laura&#x27;s foundation in the color</li>
            <li>Laura makes a fantastic and machine washable version.    </li>
            <li>Tinted moisturizer is like a hint of color added to your moisturizer, which is why I chose Nude and am happy with the overall look to my face and feel on my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even applied it in the car on my daily commute, and it always looks great, even without a mirror.</li>
            <li>Also, most of us tend to darken a bit in the summer and lighten up a bit in the winter at which point you&#x27;ll have just the right shade at your fingertips.</li>
            <li>This is the perfect moisturizer for those of us too lazy to put on makeup every time that we leave the house.</li>
            <li>For a more matte finish, set Tinted Moisturizer with Translucent Loose Powder or Pressed Setting Powder (which provides more coverage than loose) using the Laura&#x27;s wonderful and machine washable Powder Puff.    </li>
            <li>, this is streak free, did not add much shine to my face, more of a glow.</li>
            <li>a precious, carefully guarded formula that no other company has been able to duplicate.</li>
            <li>Great value too... costs me about $7 per month to wear this every single day.</li>
            <li>I think it is would be perfect for those with normal to dry skin though.</li>
            <li>I am fair, but with a yellow undertone to my skin.  </li>
            <li>love this product - so much</li>
            <li>He was helpful and the p&#x27;lem was corrected quickly.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s best over your existing moisturizer, especially if you have even a tiny bit of dryness</li>
            <li>I liked this better than a cotton ball used at other counters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As long as I don&#x27;t use too much (which you shouldn&#x27;t do anyway) it does a great job.</li>
            <li>In the summer and spring I use the oil free version (same color) and it gives me the same great coverage.</li>
            <li>am not a fan of foundation and I can rarely find one to match my skin tone</li>
            <li>but rather fresh and \\&quot;even toned\\</li>
            <li>and I could not believe how well it covered my imperfections yet looked soooo natural and healthy.  </li>
            <li>Since I prefer lighter and more natural make up solutions, I gave it a try and had a friend from the US bring it to me in Brazil.</li>
            <li>I bought the Laura Mercier sponges also--pricey but well worth it.</li>
            <li>More than just a makeup product, Laura&#x27;s Tinted Moisturizer has a special \\&quot;antioxidant vitamin complex that acts as a free radical scavenger to protect skin from even the most aggressive effects of the environment.</li>
            <li>It gives just the right amount of coverage, evening out your skintone without looking madeup.</li>
            <li>Laura Mercier Tinted Moisturizer is easy to apply, feels soft and silky to the skin.</li>
            <li>Loose (translucent) powder on top creates a more professional finish.</li>
            <li>I also feel that the color did not last all day-- more like 1/2 a day.</li>
            <li>The coverage is also too sheer for me (ok...</li>
            <li>and I was in hot, humid weather.</li>
            <li>I tried doing that as well as using it on top of a serum - but it wasn&#x27;t enough moisture throughout the day.</li>
            <li>The first time I tried this product, I applied it three times and it STILL lacked the moisture I get from my drugstore stand-bys like Oil of Olay.    </li>
            <li>so over the space of a year you don&#x27;t end up spending any more money on foundation than you would if you only purchased one color.</li>
            <li>Having sunscreen in your moisturizer won&#x27;t have this same effect because you top it with foundation or powder which keeps the reflection at bay.</li>
            <li>I found that this worked just as well at the bottom of the tube as it did from when first purchased months</li>
            <li>I have light to medium skin tone and unfortunately first purchased the \\&quot;sand\\&quot; which was far to orange/brown for my skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little thicker than most, but it goes on smoothly and evenly--foolproof.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Makeup artists recommend applying this with a brush for even coverage, which I have, but I have applied it many days with my fingers in two minutes flat.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s great about this line is that there are colors to work with both yellow and red undertones - which you won&#x27;t find in most other</li>
            <li>Conclusion: Reccomended only as good buy for younger skin without a lot of coverage issues.</li>
            <li>I think I need a little evening out of my facial skin tone in the bright light of day.  </li>
            <li>TM is light and sheer, and you can built in up in areas that need a bit more help, like red zones and undereye circles.</li>
            <li>Not only is it a gorgeous shimmer, it is also hydrating as its a moisturizer and therefore won&#x27;t dry your skin out like some do, and neither will it grease your skin as some shimmer oils do.    </li>
            <li>I do not wear foundation, but really liked the idea of a tinted moisturizer since I like to wear a moisturizer with SPF every day to protect my skin and wanted just a little color without the caked on feel or look.    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, evens out my skin tones (even the red on my chin) and has sun block.  </li>
            <li>and I had to throw them out because they caused too much caking</li>
            <li>i wouldn&#x27;t really know.  </li>
            <li>and I also thought it wouldn&#x27;t really cover anything.</li>
            <li>-VERY</li>
            <li>UVA/UVB sunscreen also reflects light and this shows up in pictures as &#x60;ghost face&#x27; -- a horror for brides when they get their pictures back.</li>
            <li>I tried this as an alternative to Bare Minerals on days where I didn&#x27;t want a full face of make-up.</li>
            <li>I have very normal skin -- doesn&#x27;t take much moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I love, love, love Laura Mercier&#x27;s products, but this one just disappointed.     </li>
            <li>I highly, highly recommend this unless your skin is very oily.</li>
            <li>Tinted Moisturizer is a great choice for women who want to look natural but still have a few things to cover because the look and feel are sheer and lightweight</li>
            <li>My main problem is reddish skin, sensitive to heat and hot showers, just sensitive in general, otherwise my skin is not bad.  </li>
            <li>&quot; I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>The look it gives is healthy skin and a little color.  </li>
            <li>An application of Foundation Primer first will naturally extend the wear of Tinted Moisturizer especially for oilier skins or all skins in warmer/humid months.</li>
            <li>Goes on sheer, and my skin (which is a bit dry) looks smooth and dewy.</li>
            <li>(their loose powders are very sheer and light too).  </li>
            <li>you can&#x27;t really use it near your eyes or on your under-eye circles, which adds an extra step since you have to bother with concealer.</li>
            <li>Being that it is difficult to render color accurately on a computer for the purpose of color swatches, the following notes should help you select the appropriate shade of Tinted Moisturizer.</li>
            <li>As a professional, freelance makeup artist, this is my preferred route.</li>
            <li>I started using the moisturizer in early summer.  </li>
            <li>Since I hate foundation this is perfect for me.</li>
            <li>Yet despite being so lightweight in look and feel, Tinted Moisturizer is extremely long wearing, stays color true all day long (a boon to oily skins) and wears evenly.     </li>
            <li>My suggestion is to buy a color one shade darker than your normal makeup as it goes on fairly sheer.</li>
            <li>I feel like I have my young, natural skin back.</li>
            <li>Most other brands that I have tried have little color and coverage.  </li>
            <li>Another trick I like with Laura&#x27;s Tinted Moisturizer is mixing a little of it with my oil-free foundation to get a slightly more natural looking finish or to slightly lighten or darken the color here as well.      </li>
            <li>I tried this awhile back &amp; was pleasantly surprised...</li>
            <li>If you only want a hit of color and a natural, lightweight amount of coverage, this is the foundation for you.</li>
            <li>The downward blending motion helps to keep the foundation from getting under the very tiny, and nearly microscopic hairs we all grow on our faces.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a big fan of the natural look and no one can tell that I have this on.</li>
            <li>Golden Beige or Honey Beige would use Tinted Moisturizer - ALMOND  -MEDIUM to DARK skin tones or those who use Laura&#x27;s Foundation in colors Suntan Beige or Sunset Beige would use Tinted Moisturizer - TAN  -DARKER skin tones or those who use Laura&#x27;s Foundation in colors Toffee Bronze or Deep Bronze would use Tinted Moisturizer - WALNUT     </li>
            <li>I also tired a sample of the oil-free tinted moisturizer and found it to be a bit heavier and more matte in finish.  </li>
            <li>After 4 years in New England (read: no more tan), the color nude is now my exact skin tone.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used foundations in the past but now like tinted moisturizers because they are light, easy to apply and have a very subtle look.</li>
            <li>I hate bothering with makeup most of the time but this fabulous product kills two birds with one stone.</li>
            <li>My only query is whether the SPF is really broad spectrum or if sunscreen should be worn under the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you prefer a soft/slightly moist finish, set the Tint with a small amount of Translucent Loose Powder by lightly tapping with the side of the Powder Brush.</li>
            <li>UVA/UVB sunscreen in a foundation makes it much thicker and can give the color a slightly &#x60;off &#x60;or &#x60;whitish cast.</li>
            <li>I think it evens out skin tone, dark circles and red noses in the winter very well.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quite normal to fall between two shades due to the infinite variety of skin tones and tan variations throughout the year.</li>

            <li> You might just do better purchasing a super-hydrating foundation and applying it lighter with a cosmetic sponge.     </li>
            <li> I am so glad I bought this.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for more coverage -- look elsewear.  </li>
            <li> but i really love this product.  </li>
            <li> and so I use this during the winter on top of my moisturizer, I don&#x27;t recommend using it alone.</li>
            <li> Would suit a more olive skin tone.  </li>
            <li> Warm Ivory would use Tinted Moisturizer - NUDE  -LIGHT</li>
            <li> Many of her clients do this.</li>
            <li> A sponge will help you apply the product more evenly than using your fingers.</li>
            <li> I love it and don&#x27;t know how I ever did without it.</li>
            <li> Better yet, buy two tubes and depending on your mood, apply accordingly.</li>
            <li> Perhaps the oil-free version works better, but this product was like applying paint.</li>
            <li> I read somewhere online that Sarah Jessica Parker attributes her healthy glow to the Nude shade of the Laura Mercier Tinted Moisturizer as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It worked well on keeping my rash area covered up with a more healthy look.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;nude\\&quot; is a much more neutral tone.  </li>
            <li> The coverage is light and it is very easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> While this product might not be good for someone who wants full coverage, it evens out skin tone nicely and removes any redness around the nose area.  </li>
            <li> so easy to apply</li>
            <li> I like this product because it&#x27;s easy to put on</li>
            <li> This is a great product for people who want a natural, dewy look with light coverage.  </li>
            <li> Easy to Use:  </li>
            <li> tube is easy to grasp with one hand and remove the twist-off cap in one twist.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for women who have good skin but just need to even things out or look \\&quot;awake\\&quot; before they head out for the day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, blends easily, stays put all day (with or without the foundation primer) and is not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> When I hit my 40s, my wonderful skin started to look a little less than wonderful.</li>
            <li> Then my sister-in-law mentioned that she is a huge Laura Mercier fan because of the Tinted Moisturizer... wouldn&#x27;t leave home without it.</li>
            <li> Application goes on smoothly and it wears well.</li>
            <li> Light and dewy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fantastic product.</li>
            <li> It works well with a light tan and warms up winter skin without being orange at all.  </li>
            <li> I have light asian/yellow complexion.</li>
            <li> but it provides light to medium coverage.</li>
            <li> TO LIGHT skin tones or those who use Laura&#x27;s foundation in the color</li>
            <li> Laura makes a fantastic and machine washable version.    </li>
            <li> Tinted moisturizer is like a hint of color added to your moisturizer, which is why I chose Nude and am happy with the overall look to my face and feel on my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even applied it in the car on my daily commute, and it always looks great, even without a mirror.</li>
            <li> Also, most of us tend to darken a bit in the summer and lighten up a bit in the winter at which point you&#x27;ll have just the right shade at your fingertips.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect moisturizer for those of us too lazy to put on makeup every time that we leave the house.</li>
            <li> For a more matte finish, set Tinted Moisturizer with Translucent Loose Powder or Pressed Setting Powder (which provides more coverage than loose) using the Laura&#x27;s wonderful and machine washable Powder Puff.    </li>
            <li> , this is streak free, did not add much shine to my face, more of a glow.</li>
            <li> a precious, carefully guarded formula that no other company has been able to duplicate.</li>
            <li> Great value too... costs me about $7 per month to wear this every single day.</li>
            <li> I think it is would be perfect for those with normal to dry skin though.</li>
            <li> I am fair, but with a yellow undertone to my skin.  </li>
            <li> love this product - so much</li>
            <li> He was helpful and the p&#x27;lem was corrected quickly.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s best over your existing moisturizer, especially if you have even a tiny bit of dryness</li>
            <li> I liked this better than a cotton ball used at other counters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As long as I don&#x27;t use too much (which you shouldn&#x27;t do anyway) it does a great job.</li>
            <li> In the summer and spring I use the oil free version (same color) and it gives me the same great coverage.</li>
            <li> am not a fan of foundation and I can rarely find one to match my skin tone</li>
            <li> but rather fresh and \\&quot;even toned\\</li>
            <li> and I could not believe how well it covered my imperfections yet looked soooo natural and healthy.  </li>
            <li> Since I prefer lighter and more natural make up solutions, I gave it a try and had a friend from the US bring it to me in Brazil.</li>
            <li> I bought the Laura Mercier sponges also--pricey but well worth it.</li>
            <li> More than just a makeup product, Laura&#x27;s Tinted Moisturizer has a special \\&quot;antioxidant vitamin complex that acts as a free radical scavenger to protect skin from even the most aggressive effects of the environment.</li>
            <li> It gives just the right amount of coverage, evening out your skintone without looking madeup.</li>
            <li> Laura Mercier Tinted Moisturizer is easy to apply, feels soft and silky to the skin.</li>
            <li> Loose (translucent) powder on top creates a more professional finish.</li>
            <li> I also feel that the color did not last all day-- more like 1/2 a day.</li>
            <li> The coverage is also too sheer for me (ok...</li>
            <li> and I was in hot, humid weather.</li>
            <li> I tried doing that as well as using it on top of a serum - but it wasn&#x27;t enough moisture throughout the day.</li>
            <li> The first time I tried this product, I applied it three times and it STILL lacked the moisture I get from my drugstore stand-bys like Oil of Olay.    </li>
            <li> so over the space of a year you don&#x27;t end up spending any more money on foundation than you would if you only purchased one color.</li>
            <li> Having sunscreen in your moisturizer won&#x27;t have this same effect because you top it with foundation or powder which keeps the reflection at bay.</li>
            <li> I found that this worked just as well at the bottom of the tube as it did from when first purchased months</li>
            <li> I have light to medium skin tone and unfortunately first purchased the \\&quot;sand\\&quot; which was far to orange/brown for my skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little thicker than most, but it goes on smoothly and evenly--foolproof.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Makeup artists recommend applying this with a brush for even coverage, which I have, but I have applied it many days with my fingers in two minutes flat.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s great about this line is that there are colors to work with both yellow and red undertones - which you won&#x27;t find in most other</li>
            <li> Conclusion: Reccomended only as good buy for younger skin without a lot of coverage issues.</li>
            <li> I think I need a little evening out of my facial skin tone in the bright light of day.  </li>
            <li> TM is light and sheer, and you can built in up in areas that need a bit more help, like red zones and undereye circles.</li>
            <li> Not only is it a gorgeous shimmer, it is also hydrating as its a moisturizer and therefore won&#x27;t dry your skin out like some do, and neither will it grease your skin as some shimmer oils do.    </li>
            <li> I do not wear foundation, but really liked the idea of a tinted moisturizer since I like to wear a moisturizer with SPF every day to protect my skin and wanted just a little color without the caked on feel or look.    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, evens out my skin tones (even the red on my chin) and has sun block.  </li>
            <li> and I had to throw them out because they caused too much caking</li>
            <li> i wouldn&#x27;t really know.  </li>
            <li> and I also thought it wouldn&#x27;t really cover anything.</li>
            <li> -VERY</li>
            <li> UVA/UVB sunscreen also reflects light and this shows up in pictures as &#x60;ghost face&#x27; -- a horror for brides when they get their pictures back.</li>
            <li> I tried this as an alternative to Bare Minerals on days where I didn&#x27;t want a full face of make-up.</li>
            <li> I have very normal skin -- doesn&#x27;t take much moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I love, love, love Laura Mercier&#x27;s products, but this one just disappointed.     </li>
            <li> I highly, highly recommend this unless your skin is very oily.</li>
            <li> Tinted Moisturizer is a great choice for women who want to look natural but still have a few things to cover because the look and feel are sheer and lightweight</li>
            <li> My main problem is reddish skin, sensitive to heat and hot showers, just sensitive in general, otherwise my skin is not bad.  </li>
            <li> &quot; I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> The look it gives is healthy skin and a little color.  </li>
            <li> An application of Foundation Primer first will naturally extend the wear of Tinted Moisturizer especially for oilier skins or all skins in warmer/humid months.</li>
            <li> Goes on sheer, and my skin (which is a bit dry) looks smooth and dewy.</li>
            <li> (their loose powders are very sheer and light too).  </li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t really use it near your eyes or on your under-eye circles, which adds an extra step since you have to bother with concealer.</li>
            <li> Being that it is difficult to render color accurately on a computer for the purpose of color swatches, the following notes should help you select the appropriate shade of Tinted Moisturizer.</li>
            <li> As a professional, freelance makeup artist, this is my preferred route.</li>
            <li> I started using the moisturizer in early summer.  </li>
            <li> Since I hate foundation this is perfect for me.</li>
            <li> Yet despite being so lightweight in look and feel, Tinted Moisturizer is extremely long wearing, stays color true all day long (a boon to oily skins) and wears evenly.     </li>
            <li> My suggestion is to buy a color one shade darker than your normal makeup as it goes on fairly sheer.</li>
            <li> I feel like I have my young, natural skin back.</li>
            <li> Most other brands that I have tried have little color and coverage.  </li>
            <li> Another trick I like with Laura&#x27;s Tinted Moisturizer is mixing a little of it with my oil-free foundation to get a slightly more natural looking finish or to slightly lighten or darken the color here as well.      </li>
            <li> I tried this awhile back &amp; was pleasantly surprised...</li>
            <li> If you only want a hit of color and a natural, lightweight amount of coverage, this is the foundation for you.</li>
            <li> The downward blending motion helps to keep the foundation from getting under the very tiny, and nearly microscopic hairs we all grow on our faces.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of the natural look and no one can tell that I have this on.</li>
            <li> Golden Beige or Honey Beige would use Tinted Moisturizer - ALMOND  -MEDIUM to DARK skin tones or those who use Laura&#x27;s Foundation in colors Suntan Beige or Sunset Beige would use Tinted Moisturizer - TAN  -DARKER skin tones or those who use Laura&#x27;s Foundation in colors Toffee Bronze or Deep Bronze would use Tinted Moisturizer - WALNUT     </li>
            <li> I also tired a sample of the oil-free tinted moisturizer and found it to be a bit heavier and more matte in finish.  </li>
            <li> After 4 years in New England (read: no more tan), the color nude is now my exact skin tone.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used foundations in the past but now like tinted moisturizers because they are light, easy to apply and have a very subtle look.</li>
            <li> I hate bothering with makeup most of the time but this fabulous product kills two birds with one stone.</li>
            <li> My only query is whether the SPF is really broad spectrum or if sunscreen should be worn under the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you prefer a soft/slightly moist finish, set the Tint with a small amount of Translucent Loose Powder by lightly tapping with the side of the Powder Brush.</li>
            <li> UVA/UVB sunscreen in a foundation makes it much thicker and can give the color a slightly &#x60;off &#x60;or &#x60;whitish cast.</li>
            <li> I think it evens out skin tone, dark circles and red noses in the winter very well.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite normal to fall between two shades due to the infinite variety of skin tones and tan variations throughout the year.</li>
            <li> A few years ago I searched high and low for a tinted moisturizer that would work with my skin tone, and wasn&#x27;t successful--until I found this one.</li>
            <li> just not natural enough for me.</li>
            <li> - it is somewhat long lasting.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the idea of putting on foundation, but I wanted a little more coverage on my face (to hide some broken capillaries and redness around my nose and face).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit expensive, and if there are other products better than this one...</li>
            <li> minor unevenness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried several other tinted moisturizers before I found this product.  </li>
            <li> The only shade other than Nude</li>
            <li> I would recommend a moisturizer underneath for dry skin or in the winter</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll only use about half the amount of  each shade when you mix (therefore each tube lasts you twice as long)</li>
            <li> I use nude for the tinted lotion and beige loose powder; I have a fair/light complexion.  </li>
            <li> 1.5 ounce tube will last from 4-5 months, probably longer now that fall is here and less coverage is needed for this season.</li>
            <li> I originally tried an array of mineral powders (bare essentials and everyday minerals) and found they provided too much coverage, looked too matte and, worst of all, exaggerated my fine lines.</li>
            <li> This product gives me a nice dewy base for a power foundation (Shiseido)</li>
            <li> While being SPF 20 (refers to UVB only), the active ingredients Laura uses in her Tinted Moisturizers do provide a small amount of  UVA protection yet are not completely broad spectrum.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit on the pricey side but a little goes a long way.   </li>
            <li> skin with PINK TONES or those who use Laura&#x27;s Foundation in colors Shell Beige or Vanilla Beige would use Tinted Moisturizer - FAWN (note-this is not super pink)   -MEDIUM</li>
            <li> It looks like from the other reviewers</li>
            <li> The colors are not natural looking, at least the ones I have tried.</li>
            <li> (I wait a few minutes between the 2).  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s just no need for heavy coverage anymore</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve also tried Lancome tinted moisturizer and found it to be too heavy.)  </li>
            <li> If you already use one of Laura&#x27;s foundations and know the color name, I made note of the approximate color of Tint you would likely use.   </li>
            <li> Waste of money.  </li>
            <li> even used this a few times as an under eye concealer when the skin looked lighter in color and needed a boost.</li>
            <li> This may be a fantastic foundation (I&#x27;m not really qualified to rate that category), but it is a HORRIBLE moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> Was a little hard getting Sephora by email.</li>
            <li> Not when tinted moisturizer takes a few years off!</li>
            <li> The moiturizer is very heavy and gooey, and does not go on evenly.</li>
            <li> Instead of slippery, it feels a little watery, therefore difficult to blend and must be applied a little at a time.</li>
            <li> This has an anti-oxidant complex that protects the skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you want a thick cover than this is the product you might consider.</li>
            <li> The price is a bit steep, but I used it all compared to tossing out the Mac Face and Body Foundation and using the Serious Skin Care Tinted Moisturizer infrequently.months ago.  </li>
            <li> The price is a bit steep, but I used it all compared to tossing out the Mac Face and Body Foundation and using the Serious Skin Care Tinted Moisturizer infrequently.  </li>
            <li> It IS greasy and thick and goopey and extremely difficult to apply evenly.  </li>
            <li> This survived the brutal temps in Southern California.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> I will buy this in Nude for everyday use and when I do not have any tan, real or fake.</li>
            <li> Plus, it&#x27;s expensive for the amount of product you recieve.</li>
            <li> I was never into powders or foundation before reason being I bought 3 or 4 of them before (expensive ones)</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical about using this product.  </li>
            <li> Boy was I wrong.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick, greasy and looks very artificial.</li>
            <li> and I hated that heavy feeling on my face.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> If you have acne prone or oily skin, do not purchase this product. I made me break out. I think it is would be perfect for those with normal to dry skin though.</li>
            <li> I tried this awhile back &amp; was pleasantly surprised...this is an item I would not want to be without.I have fair skin and use the nude which is just perfect for me....so easy to apply..makes my skin look \\&quot;just right\\&quot; for the day... I will definitly continue to use it...thank you for an excellent product !!</li>
            <li> I love the Laura Mercier tinted face cream. I used the tan and it was wonderful. The coverage is light and it is very easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not a fan of foundation and I can rarely find one to match my skin tone so I tend to wear foundation only in the evening.  At age 46 I think I need a little evening out of my facial skin tone in the bright light of day.  This is perfect, the tan works well for me and my skin looks so much better.  It doesn&#x27;t look done but rather fresh and \\&quot;even toned\\&quot; I recommend it highly.My only query is whether the SPF is really broad spectrum or if sunscreen should be worn under the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My package came without the product. Was a little hard getting Sephora by email. I went through Amazon to complain and then got a Sephora agent Dan. He was helpful and the p&#x27;lem was corrected quickly.I am glad I did not ask for a refund. I will definitely be buying this again.</li>
            <li> Granted, I don&#x27;t look my age, however, this tinted moisturizer is just perfect for me.  It&#x27;s light, evens out my skin tones (even the red on my chin) and has sun block.  btw, I use a moisturizer (whatever I have around, samples, whatever) before I apply this (I wait a few minutes between the 2).  If you want a natural look when your skin is thinning, this is so wonderful!</li>
            <li> When I hit my 40s, my wonderful skin started to look a little less than wonderful. I had never worn a drop of foundation, and didn&#x27;t want to start... just not natural enough for me. Then my sister-in-law mentioned that she is a huge Laura Mercier fan because of the Tinted Moisturizer... wouldn&#x27;t leave home without it. I found a beauty counter, asked for a demo, and I was hooked. I feel like I have my young, natural skin back. TM is light and sheer, and you can built in up in areas that need a bit more help, like red zones and undereye circles. Some days I can even skip the undereye concealer. But I never have that unflattering foundation mask-y look. I&#x27;ve since learned that Laura&#x27;s Tinted Moisturizer is considered a legendary product in the beauty world... a precious, carefully guarded formula that no other company has been able to duplicate. Laura Mercier is a genius. So is my sister-in-law. :o) Great value too... costs me about $7 per month to wear this every single day.</li>
            <li> I tried this as an alternative to Bare Minerals on days where I didn&#x27;t want a full face of make-up. Here&#x27;s what I found:    Pros: Light coverage (as promised), good moisturizer, and I felt that the color choices were true-to-life.    Cons: I got some skin irritation when I got too close to my eyes-- you can&#x27;t really use it near your eyes or on your under-eye circles, which adds an extra step since you have to bother with concealer. I also feel that the color did not last all day-- more like 1/2 a day. Plus, it&#x27;s expensive for the amount of product you recieve. You might just do better purchasing a super-hydrating foundation and applying it lighter with a cosmetic sponge.     Conclusion: Reccomended only as good buy for younger skin without a lot of coverage issues.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love Laura Mercier&#x27;s products, but this one just disappointed.     The moiturizer is very heavy and gooey, and does not go on evenly. Since it is tinted, an even application is necessary. The colors are not natural looking, at least the ones I have tried. And it did not make my face feel moisturized.     The coverage is also too sheer for me (ok... so I&#x27;m a tad bit over 40). So I would need to use foundation anyway.     I&#x27;m sticking to a non-tinted moisturizer (not by Laura M).</li>
            <li> I am so glad I bought this. I don&#x27;t like the idea of putting on foundation, but I wanted a little more coverage on my face (to hide some broken capillaries and redness around my nose and face). This is the perfect choice. Goes on sheer, and my skin (which is a bit dry) looks smooth and dewy. I&#x27;m fairly light-skinned and asian, but the nude is the perfect shade for me!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product four years and have introduced my daughter to it.  She loves it too.  It&#x27;s just what the name implies: tinted moisturizer.  Application goes on smoothly and it wears well. If you are looking for more coverage -- look elsewear.  This just enhances ones complexion a bit and looks quite sheer.</li>
            <li> I was never into powders or foundation before reason being I bought 3 or 4 of them before (expensive ones) and I had to throw them out because they caused too much caking and I hated that heavy feeling on my face.  I like this product because it&#x27;s easy to put on and it&#x27;s very light. (use a sponge wedge not your fingers, it&#x27;s easier to blend).  My main problem is reddish skin, sensitive to heat and hot showers, just sensitive in general, otherwise my skin is not bad.  I recommend moisterizing and wait until it absorbs, then use the tinted lotion and a powder for the shine.  (their loose powders are very sheer and light too).  I use nude for the tinted lotion and beige loose powder; I have a fair/light complexion.  It&#x27;s a bit expensive, and if there are other products better than this one...i wouldn&#x27;t really know.  but i really love this product.  good luck shopping!</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical about using this product.  For one I thought it would make my skin break out and I also thought it wouldn&#x27;t really cover anything. Boy was I wrong.  I finally used this when I went on a cruise this winter and I could not believe how well it covered my imperfections yet looked soooo natural and healthy.  It also did not make my skin break out and I was in hot, humid weather. I used this in Sand which went well with my tan.  I will buy this in Nude for everyday use and when I do not have any tan, real or fake. The SPF 20 is a nice added bonus too. This glides over your skin easily and blends wonderfully. I highly, highly recommend this unless your skin is very oily.</li>
            <li> A few years ago I searched high and low for a tinted moisturizer that would work with my skin tone, and wasn&#x27;t successful--until I found this one. What&#x27;s great about this line is that there are colors to work with both yellow and red undertones - which you won&#x27;t find in most other lines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have combination skin and so I use this during the winter on top of my moisturizer, I don&#x27;t recommend using it alone. I tried doing that as well as using it on top of a serum - but it wasn&#x27;t enough moisture throughout the day. It gives me an even look without looking like I have foundation on. People always ask me what is making my skin \\&quot;glow like that\\&quot;. In the summer and spring I use the oil free version (same color) and it gives me the same great coverage. Light and dewy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Makeup artists recommend applying this with a brush for even coverage, which I have, but I have applied it many days with my fingers in two minutes flat. And it looks great. I highly recommend this product for women who have good skin but just need to even things out or look \\&quot;awake\\&quot; before they head out for the day. I also use this for night looks -- and always receive compliments. There&#x27;s just no need for heavy coverage anymore which I think ages you. Not when tinted moisturizer takes a few years off!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always read wonderful things about Laura Mercier&#x27;s tinted moisturizer. Since I prefer lighter and more natural make up solutions, I gave it a try and had a friend from the US bring it to me in Brazil. And I don&#x27;t regret it. It&#x27;s a fantastic product. It&#x27;s light, blends easily, stays put all day (with or without the foundation primer) and is not greasy at all. It&#x27;s a great choice even for the Brazilian Summer climate (hot and humid).  I have fair to light skin with neutral undertone, and Nude is the perfect color for me.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect tinted moisturizer and the best one I have ever tried.  I use it regularly every summer and when I travel.  I tried several other tinted moisturizers before I found this product.  I use this tinted moisturizer along with loose powder for a perfect, flawless finish.  Most other brands that I have tried have little color and coverage.  This product moisturizes as well as provides good coverage.  Additionally, it has SPF 20 which blocks harmful UV rays.  I recommend this tinted moisturizer for anyone who wants to shorten their cosmetic routine, protect their skin and look great!</li>
            <li> Having read the reviews, I need to add that I have been using this tinted moisturiser in \\&quot;sand\\&quot; for about a year.  It works well with a light tan and warms up winter skin without being orange at all.  I think it evens out skin tone, dark circles and red noses in the winter very well.  Would suit a more olive skin tone.  I am fair, but with a yellow undertone to my skin.  The look it gives is healthy skin and a little color.  It does need a moisturiser underneath.  Loose (translucent) powder on top creates a more professional finish.</li>
            <li> I do not wear foundation, but really liked the idea of a tinted moisturizer since I like to wear a moisturizer with SPF every day to protect my skin and wanted just a little color without the caked on feel or look.    This may be a fantastic foundation (I&#x27;m not really qualified to rate that category), but it is a HORRIBLE moisturizer.  I have very normal skin -- doesn&#x27;t take much moisturizer.  The first time I tried this product, I applied it three times and it STILL lacked the moisture I get from my drugstore stand-bys like Oil of Olay.    The name of this product is incredibly misleading.  I see that most of the positive reviewers here use it as a foundation, which is great, but it should be called a Foundation rather than a Moisturizer.  I am returning the product and will continue my search for a good tinted moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for people who want a natural, dewy look with light coverage.  I originally tried an array of mineral powders (bare essentials and everyday minerals) and found they provided too much coverage, looked too matte and, worst of all, exaggerated my fine lines. A friend suggested a tinted moisturizer and after doing some research, I settled on Laura Mercier.  (I&#x27;ve also tried Lancome tinted moisturizer and found it to be too heavy.)  While this product might not be good for someone who wants full coverage, it evens out skin tone nicely and removes any redness around the nose area.  I also tired a sample of the oil-free tinted moisturizer and found it to be a bit heavier and more matte in finish.  It&#x27;s a bit on the pricey side but a little goes a long way.   All in all, this is a great tinted moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Pro:&lt;br /&gt;color - I have light asian/yellow complexion. After 6 years of living in Texas (read: tan), the color sand literally melts into my skin. After 4 years in New England (read: no more tan), the color nude is now my exact skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;coverage - It is very sheer. It does not cover the red spots on my face, only diminishes it and evens out minor unevenness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;consistency - it does not feel like a moisturizer. Instead of slippery, it feels a little watery, therefore difficult to blend and must be applied a little at a time. It is good for my combination skin or in the summer and does not look greasy. I would recommend a moisturizer underneath for dry skin or in the winter and I think it works for oily/combination skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;wear - it is somewhat long lasting. If you wipe your face with tissue, a noticeable amount will come off, but at end of the day when using make up remover, you can still see colors coming off.</li>
            <li> If you only want a hit of color and a natural, lightweight amount of coverage, this is the foundation for you. This tint can be worn alone but it&#x27;s best over your existing moisturizer, especially if you have even a tiny bit of dryness (you don&#x27;t want your skin to be drinking in makeup, do you?) This moisturizing formula will hydrate, soften, and impart a very healthy looking glow to the skin. Tinted Moisturizer is a great choice for women who want to look natural but still have a few things to cover because the look and feel are sheer and lightweight but it provides light to medium coverage. SPF 20 is a nice addition to help protect the skin from both UVB rays as well as some UVA rays.* On the scale of Laura Mercier&#x27;s foundations, Tinted Moisturizer provides the lightest coverage. Yet despite being so lightweight in look and feel, Tinted Moisturizer is extremely long wearing, stays color true all day long (a boon to oily skins) and wears evenly.     More than just a makeup product, Laura&#x27;s Tinted Moisturizer has a special \\&quot;antioxidant vitamin complex that acts as a free radical scavenger to protect skin from even the most aggressive effects of the environment.* \\&quot; Who hoo! Bonus!    Notes on shade choices:  Being that it is difficult to render color accurately on a computer for the purpose of color swatches, the following notes should help you select the appropriate shade of Tinted Moisturizer. If you already use one of Laura&#x27;s foundations and know the color name, I made note of the approximate color of Tint you would likely use.   -VERY FAIR skin tones or those who use Laura&#x27;s Foundation in colors Porcelain Ivory or Blush Ivory would use Tinted Moisturizer - PORCELAIN  -FAIR TO LIGHT skin tones or those who use Laura&#x27;s foundation in the color Warm Ivory would use Tinted Moisturizer - NUDE  -LIGHT TO MEDIUM skin tones or those who use Laura&#x27;s Foundation in colors Sunny Beige or Vanilla Beige would use Tinted Moisturizer - SAND  -MEDIUM skin with PINK TONES or those who use Laura&#x27;s Foundation in colors Shell Beige or Vanilla Beige would use Tinted Moisturizer - FAWN (note-this is not super pink)   -MEDIUM skin tones or those who use Laura&#x27;s Foundation in colors Golden Beige or Honey Beige would use Tinted Moisturizer - ALMOND  -MEDIUM to DARK skin tones or those who use Laura&#x27;s Foundation in colors Suntan Beige or Sunset Beige would use Tinted Moisturizer - TAN  -DARKER skin tones or those who use Laura&#x27;s Foundation in colors Toffee Bronze or Deep Bronze would use Tinted Moisturizer - WALNUT     It&#x27;s quite normal to fall between two shades due to the infinite variety of skin tones and tan variations throughout the year. If this is the case for you, Laura recommends mixing those two shades together to get the perfect, custom match. Many of her clients do this. You&#x27;ll only use about half the amount of  each shade when you mix (therefore each tube lasts you twice as long) so over the space of a year you don&#x27;t end up spending any more money on foundation than you would if you only purchased one color. Plus you get the bonus of precision matched color. Also, most of us tend to darken a bit in the summer and lighten up a bit in the winter at which point you&#x27;ll have just the right shade at your fingertips. Another trick I like with Laura&#x27;s Tinted Moisturizer is mixing a little of it with my oil-free foundation to get a slightly more natural looking finish or to slightly lighten or darken the color here as well.      Easy to Use:  Apply after skincare/moisturizer, using a downward motion with fingertips or a sponge. The downward blending motion helps to keep the foundation from getting under the very tiny, and nearly microscopic hairs we all grow on our faces. A sponge will help you apply the product more evenly than using your fingers. Laura makes a fantastic and machine washable version.    Tinted Moisturizer can be worn with or without Laura&#x27;s famous, award winning, and best selling Foundation Primer underneath. An application of Foundation Primer first will naturally extend the wear of Tinted Moisturizer especially for oilier skins or all skins in warmer/humid months. If you prefer a soft/slightly moist finish, set the Tint with a small amount of Translucent Loose Powder by lightly tapping with the side of the Powder Brush. For a more matte finish, set Tinted Moisturizer with Translucent Loose Powder or Pressed Setting Powder (which provides more coverage than loose) using the Laura&#x27;s wonderful and machine washable Powder Puff.    *While being SPF 20 (refers to UVB only), the active ingredients Laura uses in her Tinted Moisturizers do provide a small amount of  UVA protection yet are not completely broad spectrum. All of Laura&#x27;s daytime Moisturizers provide SPF 15 in the form of avobenzone (listed under the chemical name) which is fully UVB and UVA protective. As a professional, freelance makeup artist, this is my preferred route. UVA/UVB sunscreen in a foundation makes it much thicker and can give the color a slightly &#x60;off &#x60;or &#x60;whitish cast. UVA/UVB sunscreen also reflects light and this shows up in pictures as &#x60;ghost face&#x27; -- a horror for brides when they get their pictures back. Having sunscreen in your moisturizer won&#x27;t have this same effect because you top it with foundation or powder which keeps the reflection at bay.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect moisturizer for those of us too lazy to put on makeup every time that we leave the house. I hate bothering with makeup most of the time but this fabulous product kills two birds with one stone. I love it and don&#x27;t know how I ever did without it. My suggestion is to buy a color one shade darker than your normal makeup as it goes on fairly sheer. Better yet, buy two tubes and depending on your mood, apply accordingly.</li>
            <li> I found this product not as advertised. It&#x27;s thick, greasy and looks very artificial. Perhaps the oil-free version works better, but this product was like applying paint. I&#x27;ve used foundations in the past but now like tinted moisturizers because they are light, easy to apply and have a very subtle look. This product was like applying grease paint. If you want a thick cover than this is the product you might consider. I bought another product from the same line, the brightening powder and it&#x27;s o.k., but don&#x27;t think I would purchase it again. Given my experience with these two products I would probably never buy anything from this line again.</li>
            <li> I like creating flawless look though people may recognize that I do have foundation on.  This product gives me a nice dewy base for a power foundation (Shiseido) I put on after.  I used to use heavier cream foundation that costs over $100 for that perfect sheen look, but now feels completely light but perfectly even.  I definitely would buy Laura Mercier Mineral Power to match with this product next.</li>
            <li> I got turned on to this because of all the hype.  After trying two different colors, I&#x27;ve finally accepted - I just DON&#x27;T like this product!!  It IS greasy and thick and goopey and extremely difficult to apply evenly.  The colors look unnatural, highlight your pores and imperfections and ultimately I don&#x27;t feel like it even moisturizes.  I will be finding a replacement.  Waste of money.  Not to mention that the tube always leaks somehow so that when you open it, there&#x27;s product all over the inside of the lid and on the outside of the dispenser.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a tinted moisturizer that actually does what it&#x27;s supposed to. I use the Almond---my complexion is close to Halle Berry&#x27;s, a honey brown I guess.  As long as I don&#x27;t use too much (which you shouldn&#x27;t do anyway) it does a great job. It&#x27;s very light and doesn&#x27;t make me feel like I have any makeup on.  I&#x27;m a big fan of the natural look and no one can tell that I have this on. Most people just comment that my skin looks nice. I workout alot and this stuff doesn&#x27;t run or streak, which is nice when I need to wipe all the sweat off my face. Since I hate foundation this is perfect for me. I bought the Laura Mercier sponges also--pricey but well worth it. They work beautifully together. Would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> love this product - so much so I  had to blog about it. Not only is it a gorgeous shimmer, it is also hydrating as its a moisturizer and therefore won&#x27;t dry your skin out like some do, and neither will it grease your skin as some shimmer oils do.    [...]</li>
            <li> The only shade other than Nude I would attempt to try is the almond. The sand and fawn are too brownish beige. This is also 20 SPF. Tinted moisturizer is like a hint of color added to your moisturizer, which is why I chose Nude and am happy with the overall look to my face and feel on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Laura Mercier Tinted Moisturizer is easy to apply, feels soft and silky to the skin. It is applied using fingertips. While I was at the counter at Nordstrom the cosmetician used a brush to apply. I liked this better than a cotton ball used at other counters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A 1.5 ounce tube will last from 4-5 months, probably longer now that fall is here and less coverage is needed for this season. This has an anti-oxidant complex that protects the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have eczema, allergic to lanolin and check ingredients on all cosmetics before buying.  The Laura Mercier Tinted Moisturizer does not contain lanolin, is Dermatologist tested and not tested on animals.  I started using the moisturizer in early summer.  This survived the brutal temps in Southern California.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You do not have the caked on look, this is streak free, did not add much shine to my face, more of a glow. I read somewhere online that Sarah Jessica Parker attributes her healthy glow to the Nude shade of the Laura Mercier Tinted Moisturizer as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I even used this a few times as an under eye concealer when the skin looked lighter in color and needed a boost. There were no breakouts associated with using the Laura Mercier Tinted Moisturizer. It worked well on keeping my rash area covered up with a more healthy look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tube is easy to grasp with one hand and remove the twist-off cap in one twist. The contents are squeezed through the opening. Although once you get to the end of the tube you will need to shake it a bit to obtain the remaining droplets. I found that this worked just as well at the bottom of the tube as it did from when first purchased months ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a tinted moisturizer that works on all skin-types and colors. The price is a bit steep, but I used it all compared to tossing out the Mac Face and Body Foundation and using the Serious Skin Care Tinted Moisturizer infrequently.months ago.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is a tinted moisturizer that works on all skin-types and colors.

            <li> I love tinted moisturizers, and this one is by far the best I&#x27;ve used. It&#x27;s a little thicker than most, but it goes on smoothly and evenly--foolproof.  I&#x27;ve even applied it in the car on my daily commute, and it always looks great, even without a mirror. It gives just the right amount of coverage, evening out your skintone without looking madeup. I have light to medium skin tone and unfortunately first purchased the \\&quot;sand\\&quot; which was far to orange/brown for my skin. It looks like from the other reviewers I&#x27;m not the only one who thought this.  The \\&quot;nude\\&quot; is a much more neutral tone.  You won&#x27;t find a better tinted moisturizer out there!</li>
