            <li> I love the product but the bottles are definitely NOT arthritis friendly. Unless I can find different packaging I will not buy again.</li>
            <li> My daughters hair has never been easier to brush since we started using the conditioner</li>
            <li> Conditioner is great! It is hard to find a good vegan conditioner.  Shampoo left my hair feeling dry and tangled.</li>

            <li> I love the smell of this product.  It leaves your hair squeaky clean.  I was expecting the natural ingredients to help with my scalp, but sadly, no relief.  Still a very nice, cleansing shampoo and heavy, yummy conditioner.</li>
            <li> We love these shampoo and conditioner, can&#x27;t say enough good things about them! Creamsicle smell and truly the only tear-free product that doesn&#x27;t make my children cry when I do their hair. NoW, they just introduced new scents! Calming Lavender and invigorating Apricot.  I can&#x27;t wait to try those aromas, here&#x27;s a tip..save $10 from the company with this code 856396</li>
            <li> I like both shampoo and conditioner. I don&#x27;t use the shampoo as body wash but only for my hair. The conditioner really helps me comb thru the tangles  while in the shower.</li>
            <li> I really liked this combo, I just think it&#x27;s a bit too expensive. Hope they give a code, or some kind of sale soon</li>
            <li> Lathers real nice, not crazy about the smell., A clean smell was be best.</li>
            <li> love this product my son has eczema It&#x27;s great for his skin using it for my newborn and 4 year old</li>
            <li> Bottle opened in transit and leaked all over. Would think they had those kinds of kinks worked out.</li>
            <li> My little boy loves it. Doesn&#x27;t hurt his eyes nor skin. Really like this product.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo and conditioner for baby.</li>
            <li> This haircare set is awesome, my hair smells like vanilla and oranges and is super soft afterwards. has been my New Years resolution to cut down on the amount of synthetic chemicals that I put on my body, and I&#x27;m glad to have found a company that makes products both EFFECTIVE and NATURAL.  Free trail here too! www.honest.com/refer_to/873658</li>
            <li> I loved the scent of this shampoo &amp; conditioner and my hair was soft and manageable after using it but I gave it away to my niece because I had an allergic rash on my hands after using it.  That happens to me in 9 out of 10 shampoos or lotions I try but I was disappointed because this was such a lovely fragrance.</li>
            <li> Very nice scent to these. Not too strong. Unfortunately my daughters have extremely sensitive skin and this wash and conditioner irritates their skin so I can&#x27;t use it with them.</li>
