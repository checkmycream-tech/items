            <li>B00DTQ12DQ Missha M Perfect Cover BB(Blemish Balm) Cream SPF 42</li>
            <li>Regenerist by Olay and the retinol products from Roc are the best products, in my opinion, on the market today.</li>
            <li>and it works great.</li>
            <li>and I continue to be extremely happy with it.</li>
            <li>Great to wear alone or under make-up.</li>
            <li>Very nice moisturizer with SPF too.  </li>
            <li>I just wanted to see if I could find something even better than the best, but Luminous Brightening wasn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li>I hear good things about this line</li>
            <li>My wife loved this product.</li>
            <li>Olay Regenerist Luminous Brightening and Protecting Lotion with SP 15 seemed to be a good product to try for wintertime improvement.</li>
            <li>The cream is supposed to be good at fading brown spots</li>
            <li>Excellent light weight product.&lt;br /&gt;Goes</li>
            <li>A doctor&#x27;s review here indicates that she had researched the ingredients that were contained in this product and felt good about all of them.</li>
            <li>This also makes me feel good about using the product.  </li>
            <li>So on that, we&#x27;re in good shape.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a nice product and if one&#x27;s skin needs a good moisturizer with a sun spot protector, this would be a good possibility.</li>
            <li>This is a really great addition to what is already one of the most high-quality lines of skin care products on the market.</li>
            <li>Love the product!</li>
            <li>If they could re-formulate it with a higher SPF, it would be perfect for year-round use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Living in the southeast in the sunshine state, I try to make certain that I never leave the house without sunscreen and so appreciate that in addition to the excellent moisturizing effects, that I don&#x27;t need to apply a separate sunscreen.</li>
            <li>And if a product can’t work on its own, it won’t work in my personalized skin care regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;</li>
            <li>I can mix it with my foundation or use it on it&#x27;s own.  </li>
            <li>It adds a nice glow too.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a nice touch for those of us with severe allergies.&lt;br</li>
            <li>-in-all, it&#x27;s a nice daytime moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It plays nicely under makeup, and doesn&#x27;t cause your foundation to pill or ball</li>
            <li>I liked the product</li>
            <li>all, this is a very nice, light lotion for those who use it seasonally and avoid sun exposure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Perhaps the cream would have been more effective had the spots had been darker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So light that it feels good under makeup.</li>
            <li>, I can honestly say that this is an enjoyable product.</li>
            <li>Therefore, I have stopped using this in the morning and now use it at night, where it works out just fine!</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m enjoying this product in the winter months and the application process is very nice - smooth and light</li>
            <li>This is a lightweight formula with spf 15 which is OK if you aren&#x27;t going to spend a lot of time in the sun.</li>
            <li>and I did not see that my skin was  “brighter, more glowing” or that my skin tone was “more even” as the testing claims say.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Maybe over a longer time you might see some more luminosity.</li>
            <li>I took one star off for this claim of more luminous skin which I sometimes think is just a marketing ploy.</li>
            <li>It felt nice and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Cheers :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got better things to do than reapply the cream four or five times a day.</li>
            <li>I want to be able to put the stuff on and forget it for the rest of the day.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say that I saw my skin get any more luminous or brighter.</li>
            <li>My skin feels refreshed, more supple, and well protected against the elements.</li>
            <li>I am pleased, however, that it does indeed seem to be fragrance-free.  </li>
            <li>so it is better than many I have tried.  </li>
            <li>My skin looks good in combination with the Roc night cream and has a silky feel to it, almost like a freshly exfoliated feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>favorite things about it</li>
            <li>This may technically be more advanced but it didn&#x27;t seem that way in terms of my skin&#x27;s</li>
            <li>Amazingly in this world full of products known for their scents, this is fragrance free.</li>
            <li>I use Retin-a at night and have not had a problem adding this to my morning routine even though my skin can be irritated easily.</li>
            <li>I have used various cleansers and lotions from Olay&#x27;s Regenerist line and have been happy with most of them, so thought I would try this one out for use over the winter season.</li>
            <li>I mention that only because I appreciate that Olay products have been impressively effective for my skin but at a reasonable price also and so consider it a very good value.</li>
            <li>I kind of looked funny,</li>
            <li>skin&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62;Pump dispenses an accurate amount to use</li>
            <li>When I use Olay products I always keep in mind that they spend huge amounts of money in research.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also great on light days when I don&#x27;t want to wear makeup (e.g., weekends at home) and definitely don&#x27;t want to feel like I have product on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>think how one views the efficacy of a skin moisturizer of any brand or type is very subjective and in one’s own mind and eyes as it were.</li>
            <li>It actually feels great.  </li>
            <li>It feels light weight on my skin and protects against sun burn with its SPF 15 sun block.</li>
            <li>So I really can’t effectively comment on how well this works on the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Her skin felt smooth and not greasy.</li>
            <li>on smoothly and not greasy at all.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>lotion goes on smoothly and feels great.&lt;br</li>
            <li>light, non-greasy.</li>
            <li>An issue that continued with another so-called unscented Olay moisturizer that was in fact lightly scented and my rash was still there.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easier to apply light makeup (in my case, mineral powder) to my skin without a sticky feeling.</li>
            <li>I appreciate that it&#x27;s also fragrance free.</li>
            <li>It makes me think that if you don’t have sensitive skin, this could be a good</li>
            <li>so I was excited to try out this moisturizer for the Amazon Vine</li>
            <li>I think a higher SPF would be better but</li>
            <li>I had been using this Total Effects formula in it&#x27;s night cream form and found it made my skin remarkably smooth, even more effectively</li>
            <li>But I can say that it goes on smoothly, absorbs quickly</li>
            <li>So I am actually delighted that this company finally did put out a scent free moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s extremely light and spreads quickly and evenly over my face.</li>
            <li>(Which shows no signs of ending soon here right now!)</li>
            <li>: I&#x27;ve been using two brands consistently for daily and night moisurization, with and without sunscreen, for years and am happy with them.</li>
            <li>It is good, does what it says, I can tell after about 6 weeks of use my skin tone has evened out, but I do use a sunscreen powder over it because this products SPF is low.</li>
            <li>Olay is a good brand and unless you have some sort of sensitivity to or allergic reaction to the ingredients in this product, it&#x27;s a moderate investment to see if the testing claims work for you.</li>
            <li>I have a face full of freckles</li>
            <li>So that claim appears to be true.  </li>
            <li>I would not quite describe this as a true lotion.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a good daily sunscreen moisturizer.</li>
            <li>My favorite (and very inexpensive) cream, [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>- I&#x27;d have to buy a whole separate product with a better SPF.</li>
            <li>and so it should last a while and be a good value as well.</li>
            <li>It is not bad, but I do notice it at times.</li>
            <li>I needed a more effective moisturizer to help with my dry skin.</li>
            <li>A decent moisturizer that leaves your skin soft and healthy feeling without scent (which is nice), however haven&#x27;t had an opportunity to test the SPF qualities given the winter we&#x27;ve been having.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&amp;#62;Dries quickly on</li>
            <li>and it dries quickly.</li>
            <li>But, in the meantime, I can honestly say that my skin does feel better and does look better in only a short time.</li>
            <li>Definitely a new favorite for my wife.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth a try since it says 85% see visible results.</li>
            <li>SPF is very low (15) and I will limit use to days when I am primarily indoors because i like more protection when I am spending any length of time outdoors.</li>
            <li>There are 2 pumps&#x27; worth in the</li>
            <li>PA+++ 50ml No.31 Golden Beige]]</li>
            <li>Very happy with this new product for it&#x27;s light weight, it gives the skin a visibly hydrated appearance, it continues the positive effects I&#x27;ve been appreciating from it&#x27;s related Total Effects Night Cream</li>
            <li>It is absorbed right into the skin with no yucky residue.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are other day cream products I like, DDF Moisturizing Dew or Olay Regenerist MicroSculpting is even good (no SPF).</li>
            <li>The package claims the cream is non-greasy and it&#x27;s right.</li>
            <li>I have to admit that as an older woman I do not expect a miracle in terms of line and wrinkle removal, and I am fortunate that I do not have brown spots on my face.</li>
            <li>I am not holding my breath on that much of a miracle as most spots that size can only disappear with laser light work.  </li>
            <li>The lotion feels great, both in application (rich and thick, but not too much so) and on the skin.  </li>
            <li>This is the first Olay product I have used that I have had any success with, primarily because this is the first product they have put out that is actually 100% scent free.</li>
            <li>It absorbs readily and feels just a tad bit greasy at first, but that quickly vanishes.</li>
            <li>Olay Regenerist has hit the perfect balance and covers wonderfully (a little does go a long way.)</li>
            <li>is my first Olay Regenerist product.</li>
            <li>I want to think it is possible to get more of a glow from a moisturizer, but I know that your diet and hydration and even age can impact your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Regenerist Luminous Brighting spf15 wasn&#x27;t that hot.  </li>
            <li>sounds pretty suspect to me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does make my skin feel softer and certainly it is more expensive than many over the counter products but still cheaper than e.g., Clinique (which I also use a lot and love).</li>
            <li>Most of  the skin care products that my wife uses she gets from local beauty shops or department stores, but from time to time she&#x27;ll purchase something from a mass market retailer.</li>
            <li>But I noticed that as time went by, my skin felt more and more greasy than when using my usual oily skin lotion.</li>
            <li>They do make higher SPF products, by the way.</li>
            <li>Perhaps with the ingredients that include brighteners, the higher SPF wouldn&#x27;t work as well?</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is good everyday moisturizer that I will probably continue using.</li>
            <li>It also includes Vitamin B3, Pro-Vitamin B5, Vitamin E, and green tea, all good things.</li>
            <li>I use this Olay Regenerist Luminous Brightening and Protecting Lotion as a daily moisturizer and can say that for me it goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Possibly it works better if one invests the money and time in the whole Olay regimen but that’s not something I’m likely to do, for any brand.</li>
            <li>far as the sunscreen element in it, yes, it’s thicker like sunscreens that contain zinc oxide, but the SPF is only 15 and needs to be applied every couple of hours to be effective.  </li>
            <li>The SPF level of 15 is an appropriate level of sun protection if you aren&#x27;t out all day long in the winter.</li>
            <li>This is a nice cream that has helped fade my dark spots on my neck and hands, I can see a difference.</li>
            <li>I have also gotten some compliments on how good I look this past weekend.</li>
            <li>In such cases, I&#x27;m most likely to see something like L&#x27;Oreal or a Neutrogena, you know, something familiar, cluttering up the vanity.</li>
            <li>It is now faded to the point where it&#x27;s barely visible and looks more like the very, very light little freckle it really is.</li>
            <li>What I can tell you is that I do have a fairly large sun spot on the side of my face and it does seem to be getting lighter.</li>
            <li>the cream comes in is a nice hard side plastic dispenser that with a quick push dispenses a dose of moisturizer.</li>
            <li>But if you’re interested in this product’s other benefits, 15 is definitely better than something without SPF in it.</li>
            <li>Again, as my husband would say, \\&quot;Yeah, no.\\&quot; And, SPF15 is not even a very high SPF factor.</li>
            <li>It is very lightweight and has not caused any skin problems for me.</li>
            <li>not see any real benefits or change in skin&lt;</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t burn, though, which is unusual for me--most sunscreens hurt when I put them on my face.</li>
            <li>I do, however, have several light brown spots on my hands, so I used the cream on my hands.</li>
            <li>It is much thicker.</li>
            <li>It really is.  </li>
            <li>dispenser works well and delivers a reasonable dollop of lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I started using it, I had a splatter of freckles that normally would fade in the winter, but they were always evident.</li>
            <li>There are a lot of SPF moisturizers that claim to be &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; so as not to be oily or greasy and in turn are very drying.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really use this on a year-round basis.</li>
            <li>It really is fragrance-free.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t notice any changes in my skin tone/brightness, but I assume those would take much longer.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s reasonable price.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy, and it absorbs nicely.  </li>
            <li>The only issue is that the SPF, while it&#x27;s nice, is way too low for my needs.  </li>
            <li>On the other hand it is seems to be a good moderate sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really use this on a year-round basis.so much better than other Regenerist products</li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t stand out or perform better than the other moisturizers (with and without sunscreens)</li>
            <li>The price on this is also much better than other Regenerist products</li>
            <li>Makeup that normally lasts me all day seemed to not really stick to my skin at all when applied on top of this moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am sensitive to most sunscreens, and I find I can wear this as long as I keep it away from and below my eyes</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just not seeing the &amp;#34;brightening&amp;#34; effect that was advertised - &amp;#34;In just one use it visibly fades the look of dark spots for more even toned skin.&amp;#34;  I have used it for two weeks now without visible results.</li>
            <li>When she saw I had the opportunity to get this upscale looking bottle of a new product from Olay, she really wanted to try it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this new lotion for over two weeks now, and I really like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t particularly like the directions to reapply the cream every two hours.</li>
            <li>So, Olay may not be the product you want if you are looking for a lotion with decent sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Olay</li>
            <li>I just know this particular Olay product caused an allergic reaction and then underperformed as an under-makeup product to boot.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Being fragrance-free, this is preferable to a product having an unpleasant fragrance, but to me, a light, pleasant fragrance is preferable to none at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Anyway, she said she had high expectations.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Additionally, while I&#x27;m sure the lack of the usual lotion-type scents helps those who are very sensitive to that, I personally prefer some sort of light scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, my skin does feel softer after using this every day for a week or so.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s not so easy to end up with too much and a mess.  </li>
            <li>I did take off a star for this because it only has an SPF of 15, really since it says in the directions to not have sun exposure I would think the SPF should be higher.</li>
            <li>I also found this to be reasonably priced (around 20 bucks) compared to higher end products which provide the same coverage.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t have any very notable dark spots on my face, a few light ones only, and I have never had a over-the-counter product</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin with a lot of issues (oily, large pores, redness, wrinkles, age spots), I only use certain products, but I&#x27;m always experimenting with affordably priced products.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I really like this, and will be on the lookout for a higher SPF version of this hopefully in the near future.</li>
            <li>While I still see no real luminous effects, I have still enjoyed this as my daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li>While this lotion isn&#x27;t greasy, I disagree that it&#x27;s light - it has an almost sticky feel about it, and though I didn&#x27;t notice the pilling/balling up of my makeup that others mentioned, it definitely doesn&#x27;t lend toward lasting makeup application.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel very hydrated, and is an excellent base for my foundation.</li>
            <li>And I was looking forward to using a hypoallergenic product as I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>SPF 15 is a bare minimum, and if I know I&#x27;ll be outside in direct sunlight, I do switch to their moisturizer that has SPF 30, though that contains Zinc Oxide and is more noticeably white on the skin.</li>
            <li>a higher SPF for one-time daily use</li>
            <li>I do like the way the push top delivers a small measured dose</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d just go for the product with the higher SPF for year-round use instead of buying two separate products to wear at different times of the year.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer was non-greasy and made my skin feel soft on contact!  </li>
            <li>Now, I just have to remember to scratch this off the \\&quot;potential birthday presents and stocking stuffers\\&quot; list.fragrance-free, this is preferable to a product having an unpleasant fragrance, but to me, a light, pleasant fragrance is preferable to none at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is truly fragrance free and doesn&#x27;t smell like the typical product with sun blocking ingredients (i.e., zinc oxide).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it is clearly their signature fragrance that gives me</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t use any product that is not for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>like the fact that this is a fragrance-free item since I am sensitive to perfumes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used several of this line of products and really appreciated how well they work.  </li>
            <li>your skin just looks natural and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I find the amount dispensed in just one pump is enough to cover the whole face and neck</li>
            <li>After using this incarnation a few weeks as my daily moisturizer I can report that it also is another outstanding Olay product.</li>
            <li>It feels fairly thick, like a sunscreen more than a moisturizer, until I start spreading it out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the regular Olay Regenerist Serum for about ten years, ever since I first heard about it from Paula Begoun and Dr. Leslie Baumann, who each recommend it for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>but I think SPF 15 isn&#x27;t high enough for a product like this.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not TERRIBLE, but it&#x27;s not good.  </li>
            <li>also says this is \\&quot;lightweight and non-greasy\\&quot;, but to me, it is much stickier than what I currently use, and I felt a little itchiness right after application.</li>
            <li>(I am taking a full star off for the low SPF and the dark spot nonsense.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li>/&gt;It goes on in a rich, creamy texture, so my face looked a little white for a minute.</li>
            <li>Broad Spectrum SPF</li>
            <li>For me, I have sensitive skin and really work hard to use products without scents (plus, I really don&#x27;t want to &#x27;smell my face&#x27; all morning).</li>
            <li>I must admit, I generally did forget it.</li>
            <li>Regenerist day creams absorb well and are generally lighter than what Roc makes so</li>
            <li>I put my usual Bare Minerals make-up over top with no problems.&lt;br /&gt;**************************************&lt;br /&gt;Update: I have kept using this every day and the bottle is almost empty.</li>
            <li>On top of that it wasn&#x27;t very moisturizing, it had a typical thick white SPF-y consistency.</li>
            <li>It seems to be fine as long as I didn&#x27;t use too much or put anything but a thin layer of foundation on after I used the cream.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately it is the kind of SPF chemical that makes my face red, itchy, swollen, and peely!</li>
            <li>Olay Regenerist product boasts a broad spectrum SPF 15 sunscreen feature, but according to the directions on the back of the bottle, it must be reapplied every 2 hours.</li>
            <li>It feels fairly light but has that slight tightening and drying effect I get from other daily moisturizers with SPF.</li>
            <li>I do have a dark spot on my left cheek from too much sun exposure.  </li>
            <li>I have combination skin and do feel oily after a few hours with this cream, more so than usual.</li>
            <li>The inclusion of niacinimide as one of the main ingredients means that, long-term, this will brighten up dark spots and fade blotchy patches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
    </ol>

            <li> B00DTQ12DQ Missha M Perfect Cover BB(Blemish Balm) Cream SPF 42</li>
            <li> Regenerist by Olay and the retinol products from Roc are the best products, in my opinion, on the market today.</li>
            <li> and it works great.</li>
            <li> and I continue to be extremely happy with it.</li>
            <li> Great to wear alone or under make-up.</li>
            <li> Very nice moisturizer with SPF too.  </li>
            <li> I just wanted to see if I could find something even better than the best, but Luminous Brightening wasn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li> I hear good things about this line</li>
            <li> My wife loved this product.</li>
            <li> Olay Regenerist Luminous Brightening and Protecting Lotion with SP 15 seemed to be a good product to try for wintertime improvement.</li>
            <li> The cream is supposed to be good at fading brown spots</li>
            <li> Excellent light weight product.&lt;br /&gt;Goes</li>
            <li> A doctor&#x27;s review here indicates that she had researched the ingredients that were contained in this product and felt good about all of them.</li>
            <li> This also makes me feel good about using the product.  </li>
            <li> So on that, we&#x27;re in good shape.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a nice product and if one&#x27;s skin needs a good moisturizer with a sun spot protector, this would be a good possibility.</li>
            <li> This is a really great addition to what is already one of the most high-quality lines of skin care products on the market.</li>
            <li> Love the product!</li>
            <li> If they could re-formulate it with a higher SPF, it would be perfect for year-round use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Living in the southeast in the sunshine state, I try to make certain that I never leave the house without sunscreen and so appreciate that in addition to the excellent moisturizing effects, that I don&#x27;t need to apply a separate sunscreen.</li>
            <li> And if a product can’t work on its own, it won’t work in my personalized skin care regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;</li>
            <li> I can mix it with my foundation or use it on it&#x27;s own.  </li>
            <li> It adds a nice glow too.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a nice touch for those of us with severe allergies.&lt;br</li>
            <li> -in-all, it&#x27;s a nice daytime moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It plays nicely under makeup, and doesn&#x27;t cause your foundation to pill or ball</li>
            <li> I liked the product</li>
            <li> all, this is a very nice, light lotion for those who use it seasonally and avoid sun exposure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Perhaps the cream would have been more effective had the spots had been darker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So light that it feels good under makeup.</li>
            <li> , I can honestly say that this is an enjoyable product.</li>
            <li> Therefore, I have stopped using this in the morning and now use it at night, where it works out just fine!</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m enjoying this product in the winter months and the application process is very nice - smooth and light</li>
            <li> This is a lightweight formula with spf 15 which is OK if you aren&#x27;t going to spend a lot of time in the sun.</li>
            <li> and I did not see that my skin was  “brighter, more glowing” or that my skin tone was “more even” as the testing claims say.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Maybe over a longer time you might see some more luminosity.</li>
            <li> I took one star off for this claim of more luminous skin which I sometimes think is just a marketing ploy.</li>
            <li> It felt nice and smooth.  </li>
            <li> Cheers :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got better things to do than reapply the cream four or five times a day.</li>
            <li> I want to be able to put the stuff on and forget it for the rest of the day.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that I saw my skin get any more luminous or brighter.</li>
            <li> My skin feels refreshed, more supple, and well protected against the elements.</li>
            <li> I am pleased, however, that it does indeed seem to be fragrance-free.  </li>
            <li> so it is better than many I have tried.  </li>
            <li> My skin looks good in combination with the Roc night cream and has a silky feel to it, almost like a freshly exfoliated feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> favorite things about it</li>
            <li> This may technically be more advanced but it didn&#x27;t seem that way in terms of my skin&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Amazingly in this world full of products known for their scents, this is fragrance free.</li>
            <li> I use Retin-a at night and have not had a problem adding this to my morning routine even though my skin can be irritated easily.</li>
            <li> I have used various cleansers and lotions from Olay&#x27;s Regenerist line and have been happy with most of them, so thought I would try this one out for use over the winter season.</li>
            <li> I mention that only because I appreciate that Olay products have been impressively effective for my skin but at a reasonable price also and so consider it a very good value.</li>
            <li> I kind of looked funny,</li>
            <li> skin&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62;Pump dispenses an accurate amount to use</li>
            <li> When I use Olay products I always keep in mind that they spend huge amounts of money in research.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also great on light days when I don&#x27;t want to wear makeup (e.g., weekends at home) and definitely don&#x27;t want to feel like I have product on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> think how one views the efficacy of a skin moisturizer of any brand or type is very subjective and in one’s own mind and eyes as it were.</li>
            <li> It actually feels great.  </li>
            <li> It feels light weight on my skin and protects against sun burn with its SPF 15 sun block.</li>
            <li> So I really can’t effectively comment on how well this works on the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Her skin felt smooth and not greasy.</li>
            <li> on smoothly and not greasy at all.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> lotion goes on smoothly and feels great.&lt;br</li>
            <li> light, non-greasy.</li>
            <li> An issue that continued with another so-called unscented Olay moisturizer that was in fact lightly scented and my rash was still there.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easier to apply light makeup (in my case, mineral powder) to my skin without a sticky feeling.</li>
            <li> I appreciate that it&#x27;s also fragrance free.</li>
            <li> It makes me think that if you don’t have sensitive skin, this could be a good</li>
            <li> so I was excited to try out this moisturizer for the Amazon Vine</li>
            <li> I think a higher SPF would be better but</li>
            <li> I had been using this Total Effects formula in it&#x27;s night cream form and found it made my skin remarkably smooth, even more effectively</li>
            <li> But I can say that it goes on smoothly, absorbs quickly</li>
            <li> So I am actually delighted that this company finally did put out a scent free moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely light and spreads quickly and evenly over my face.</li>
            <li> (Which shows no signs of ending soon here right now!)</li>
            <li> : I&#x27;ve been using two brands consistently for daily and night moisurization, with and without sunscreen, for years and am happy with them.</li>
            <li> It is good, does what it says, I can tell after about 6 weeks of use my skin tone has evened out, but I do use a sunscreen powder over it because this products SPF is low.</li>
            <li> Olay is a good brand and unless you have some sort of sensitivity to or allergic reaction to the ingredients in this product, it&#x27;s a moderate investment to see if the testing claims work for you.</li>
            <li> I have a face full of freckles</li>
            <li> So that claim appears to be true.  </li>
            <li> I would not quite describe this as a true lotion.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a good daily sunscreen moisturizer.</li>
            <li> My favorite (and very inexpensive) cream, [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> - I&#x27;d have to buy a whole separate product with a better SPF.</li>
            <li> and so it should last a while and be a good value as well.</li>
            <li> It is not bad, but I do notice it at times.</li>
            <li> I needed a more effective moisturizer to help with my dry skin.</li>
            <li> A decent moisturizer that leaves your skin soft and healthy feeling without scent (which is nice), however haven&#x27;t had an opportunity to test the SPF qualities given the winter we&#x27;ve been having.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&amp;#62;Dries quickly on</li>
            <li> and it dries quickly.</li>
            <li> But, in the meantime, I can honestly say that my skin does feel better and does look better in only a short time.</li>
            <li> Definitely a new favorite for my wife.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth a try since it says 85% see visible results.</li>
            <li> SPF is very low (15) and I will limit use to days when I am primarily indoors because i like more protection when I am spending any length of time outdoors.</li>
            <li> There are 2 pumps&#x27; worth in the</li>
            <li> PA+++ 50ml No.31 Golden Beige]]</li>
            <li> Very happy with this new product for it&#x27;s light weight, it gives the skin a visibly hydrated appearance, it continues the positive effects I&#x27;ve been appreciating from it&#x27;s related Total Effects Night Cream</li>
            <li> It is absorbed right into the skin with no yucky residue.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are other day cream products I like, DDF Moisturizing Dew or Olay Regenerist MicroSculpting is even good (no SPF).</li>
            <li> The package claims the cream is non-greasy and it&#x27;s right.</li>
            <li> I have to admit that as an older woman I do not expect a miracle in terms of line and wrinkle removal, and I am fortunate that I do not have brown spots on my face.</li>
            <li> I am not holding my breath on that much of a miracle as most spots that size can only disappear with laser light work.  </li>
            <li> The lotion feels great, both in application (rich and thick, but not too much so) and on the skin.  </li>
            <li> This is the first Olay product I have used that I have had any success with, primarily because this is the first product they have put out that is actually 100% scent free.</li>
            <li> It absorbs readily and feels just a tad bit greasy at first, but that quickly vanishes.</li>
            <li> Olay Regenerist has hit the perfect balance and covers wonderfully (a little does go a long way.)</li>
            <li> is my first Olay Regenerist product.</li>
            <li> I want to think it is possible to get more of a glow from a moisturizer, but I know that your diet and hydration and even age can impact your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Regenerist Luminous Brighting spf15 wasn&#x27;t that hot.  </li>
            <li> sounds pretty suspect to me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does make my skin feel softer and certainly it is more expensive than many over the counter products but still cheaper than e.g., Clinique (which I also use a lot and love).</li>
            <li> Most of  the skin care products that my wife uses she gets from local beauty shops or department stores, but from time to time she&#x27;ll purchase something from a mass market retailer.</li>
            <li> But I noticed that as time went by, my skin felt more and more greasy than when using my usual oily skin lotion.</li>
            <li> They do make higher SPF products, by the way.</li>
            <li> Perhaps with the ingredients that include brighteners, the higher SPF wouldn&#x27;t work as well?</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is good everyday moisturizer that I will probably continue using.</li>
            <li> It also includes Vitamin B3, Pro-Vitamin B5, Vitamin E, and green tea, all good things.</li>
            <li> I use this Olay Regenerist Luminous Brightening and Protecting Lotion as a daily moisturizer and can say that for me it goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Possibly it works better if one invests the money and time in the whole Olay regimen but that’s not something I’m likely to do, for any brand.</li>
            <li> far as the sunscreen element in it, yes, it’s thicker like sunscreens that contain zinc oxide, but the SPF is only 15 and needs to be applied every couple of hours to be effective.  </li>
            <li> The SPF level of 15 is an appropriate level of sun protection if you aren&#x27;t out all day long in the winter.</li>
            <li> This is a nice cream that has helped fade my dark spots on my neck and hands, I can see a difference.</li>
            <li> I have also gotten some compliments on how good I look this past weekend.</li>
            <li> In such cases, I&#x27;m most likely to see something like L&#x27;Oreal or a Neutrogena, you know, something familiar, cluttering up the vanity.</li>
            <li> It is now faded to the point where it&#x27;s barely visible and looks more like the very, very light little freckle it really is.</li>
            <li> What I can tell you is that I do have a fairly large sun spot on the side of my face and it does seem to be getting lighter.</li>
            <li> the cream comes in is a nice hard side plastic dispenser that with a quick push dispenses a dose of moisturizer.</li>
            <li> But if you’re interested in this product’s other benefits, 15 is definitely better than something without SPF in it.</li>
            <li> Again, as my husband would say, \\&quot;Yeah, no.\\&quot; And, SPF15 is not even a very high SPF factor.</li>
            <li> It is very lightweight and has not caused any skin problems for me.</li>
            <li> not see any real benefits or change in skin&lt;</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t burn, though, which is unusual for me--most sunscreens hurt when I put them on my face.</li>
            <li> I do, however, have several light brown spots on my hands, so I used the cream on my hands.</li>
            <li> It is much thicker.</li>
            <li> It really is.  </li>
            <li> dispenser works well and delivers a reasonable dollop of lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I started using it, I had a splatter of freckles that normally would fade in the winter, but they were always evident.</li>
            <li> There are a lot of SPF moisturizers that claim to be &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; so as not to be oily or greasy and in turn are very drying.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really use this on a year-round basis.</li>
            <li> It really is fragrance-free.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice any changes in my skin tone/brightness, but I assume those would take much longer.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s reasonable price.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy, and it absorbs nicely.  </li>
            <li> The only issue is that the SPF, while it&#x27;s nice, is way too low for my needs.  </li>
            <li> On the other hand it is seems to be a good moderate sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really use this on a year-round basis.so much better than other Regenerist products</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t stand out or perform better than the other moisturizers (with and without sunscreens)</li>
            <li> The price on this is also much better than other Regenerist products</li>
            <li> Makeup that normally lasts me all day seemed to not really stick to my skin at all when applied on top of this moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am sensitive to most sunscreens, and I find I can wear this as long as I keep it away from and below my eyes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just not seeing the &amp;#34;brightening&amp;#34; effect that was advertised - &amp;#34;In just one use it visibly fades the look of dark spots for more even toned skin.&amp;#34;  I have used it for two weeks now without visible results.</li>
            <li> When she saw I had the opportunity to get this upscale looking bottle of a new product from Olay, she really wanted to try it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this new lotion for over two weeks now, and I really like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t particularly like the directions to reapply the cream every two hours.</li>
            <li> So, Olay may not be the product you want if you are looking for a lotion with decent sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Olay</li>
            <li> I just know this particular Olay product caused an allergic reaction and then underperformed as an under-makeup product to boot.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Being fragrance-free, this is preferable to a product having an unpleasant fragrance, but to me, a light, pleasant fragrance is preferable to none at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Anyway, she said she had high expectations.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Additionally, while I&#x27;m sure the lack of the usual lotion-type scents helps those who are very sensitive to that, I personally prefer some sort of light scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, my skin does feel softer after using this every day for a week or so.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not so easy to end up with too much and a mess.  </li>
            <li> I did take off a star for this because it only has an SPF of 15, really since it says in the directions to not have sun exposure I would think the SPF should be higher.</li>
            <li> I also found this to be reasonably priced (around 20 bucks) compared to higher end products which provide the same coverage.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t have any very notable dark spots on my face, a few light ones only, and I have never had a over-the-counter product</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin with a lot of issues (oily, large pores, redness, wrinkles, age spots), I only use certain products, but I&#x27;m always experimenting with affordably priced products.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I really like this, and will be on the lookout for a higher SPF version of this hopefully in the near future.</li>
            <li> While I still see no real luminous effects, I have still enjoyed this as my daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li> While this lotion isn&#x27;t greasy, I disagree that it&#x27;s light - it has an almost sticky feel about it, and though I didn&#x27;t notice the pilling/balling up of my makeup that others mentioned, it definitely doesn&#x27;t lend toward lasting makeup application.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel very hydrated, and is an excellent base for my foundation.</li>
            <li> And I was looking forward to using a hypoallergenic product as I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> SPF 15 is a bare minimum, and if I know I&#x27;ll be outside in direct sunlight, I do switch to their moisturizer that has SPF 30, though that contains Zinc Oxide and is more noticeably white on the skin.</li>
            <li> a higher SPF for one-time daily use</li>
            <li> I do like the way the push top delivers a small measured dose</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d just go for the product with the higher SPF for year-round use instead of buying two separate products to wear at different times of the year.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer was non-greasy and made my skin feel soft on contact!  </li>
            <li> Now, I just have to remember to scratch this off the \\&quot;potential birthday presents and stocking stuffers\\&quot; list.fragrance-free, this is preferable to a product having an unpleasant fragrance, but to me, a light, pleasant fragrance is preferable to none at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is truly fragrance free and doesn&#x27;t smell like the typical product with sun blocking ingredients (i.e., zinc oxide).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it is clearly their signature fragrance that gives me</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t use any product that is not for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> like the fact that this is a fragrance-free item since I am sensitive to perfumes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used several of this line of products and really appreciated how well they work.  </li>
            <li> your skin just looks natural and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I find the amount dispensed in just one pump is enough to cover the whole face and neck</li>
            <li> After using this incarnation a few weeks as my daily moisturizer I can report that it also is another outstanding Olay product.</li>
            <li> It feels fairly thick, like a sunscreen more than a moisturizer, until I start spreading it out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the regular Olay Regenerist Serum for about ten years, ever since I first heard about it from Paula Begoun and Dr. Leslie Baumann, who each recommend it for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> but I think SPF 15 isn&#x27;t high enough for a product like this.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not TERRIBLE, but it&#x27;s not good.  </li>
            <li> also says this is \\&quot;lightweight and non-greasy\\&quot;, but to me, it is much stickier than what I currently use, and I felt a little itchiness right after application.</li>
            <li> (I am taking a full star off for the low SPF and the dark spot nonsense.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li> /&gt;It goes on in a rich, creamy texture, so my face looked a little white for a minute.</li>
            <li> Broad Spectrum SPF</li>
            <li> For me, I have sensitive skin and really work hard to use products without scents (plus, I really don&#x27;t want to &#x27;smell my face&#x27; all morning).</li>
            <li> I must admit, I generally did forget it.</li>
            <li> Regenerist day creams absorb well and are generally lighter than what Roc makes so</li>
            <li> I put my usual Bare Minerals make-up over top with no problems.&lt;br /&gt;**************************************&lt;br /&gt;Update: I have kept using this every day and the bottle is almost empty.</li>
            <li> On top of that it wasn&#x27;t very moisturizing, it had a typical thick white SPF-y consistency.</li>
            <li> It seems to be fine as long as I didn&#x27;t use too much or put anything but a thin layer of foundation on after I used the cream.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it is the kind of SPF chemical that makes my face red, itchy, swollen, and peely!</li>
            <li> Olay Regenerist product boasts a broad spectrum SPF 15 sunscreen feature, but according to the directions on the back of the bottle, it must be reapplied every 2 hours.</li>
            <li> It feels fairly light but has that slight tightening and drying effect I get from other daily moisturizers with SPF.</li>
            <li> I do have a dark spot on my left cheek from too much sun exposure.  </li>
            <li> I have combination skin and do feel oily after a few hours with this cream, more so than usual.</li>
            <li> The inclusion of niacinimide as one of the main ingredients means that, long-term, this will brighten up dark spots and fade blotchy patches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so then the simple pure oils I had been using in the past, like Emu Oil and Argan Oil.</li>
            <li> I tried really hard to use this product long enough to give it a fair review, but it made my skin break out pretty badly, so I had to stop.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;d like to see this in at least an SPF 30 and possibly even higher</li>
            <li> so maybe it hasn&#x27;t been long enough or it will only brighten your skin while wearing it.</li>
            <li> There was very little fragrance which with her asthma she very much appreciated.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not even long enough to get a person through the morning.  </li>
            <li> Although some people have complained that it is only SPF 15, it really isn&#x27;t designed as a sunscreen.</li>
            <li> (With the slight exception that the SPF 15 components of Avobenzone, Homosalate, Octisalate &amp; Octocrylene which have a natural scent.)</li>
            <li> However, I did start it a little early before I got</li>
            <li> I also find that it&#x27;s a bit thick in terms of its consistency, but others may not mind so much.  </li>
            <li> I mean how can you really be scientific about all this when it’s about what you see/perceive?</li>
            <li> The dry skin did seem to improve to some degree although, not completely.</li>
            <li> I first tried Olay moisturizing products several years ago after seeing Consumer Reports gave their Regenerist line one of the highest ratings of all those they tested, besting products several times as expensive.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to comment on it&#x27;s lightening of dark spots,, but it does give my face a &amp;#34;luminous&amp;#34; appearance as the name includes.it long enough to comment on it&#x27;s lightening of dark spots,, but it does give my face a &amp;#34;luminous&amp;#34; appearance as the name includes.</li>
            <li> Years ago I used Olay products quite often, but this is the second one I’ve tried that made my sensitive facial skin look and feel worse.  </li>
            <li> The texture was a little too creamy but not enough to make her not want to use it.</li>
            <li> Gave it 4 stars only because I felt it was a little pricey.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It comes out as a very thick lotion, but in a thin stream, that is almost more a cream.</li>
            <li> there is no real scent to it, no perfume smell to this one.</li>
            <li> Program.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it everyday for the last two weeks.</li>
            <li> found this lotion was not quite what I had expected it to be.</li>
            <li> I am careful not to use this around my eyes, but I do that with all this sort of product.</li>
            <li> only real negative for me is that the SPF is only 15, and my dermatologist has told me to use at least an SPF 25 or higher.  </li>
            <li> Within a few hours my eyebrows were red and snarly from the extreme itching of my skin almost driving me</li>
            <li> I had no breakouts or allergic reactions like some other reviewers.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t compare this to any other product.</li>
            <li> It is not as heavy as the jar cream of this same brand but is still heavy.</li>
            <li> I have not seen any fading of my dark spots</li>
            <li> I would not buy this product assuming it is going to get rid of dark spots and the claim it prevents them . . .</li>
            <li> This line of products does work for lightening dark spots.</li>
            <li> I had one really dark one under my eye that looked, to me at least, like a big blackhead or something.</li>
            <li> like the product but had to take off points for the SPF 15 since I probably won&#x27;t actually buy this unless the raise the SPF to at least a 30.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&amp;#62;Felt heavy and somewhat “sticky” on my skin; not as lightweight as other moisturizers&lt;br</li>
            <li> The look is subtle, but it definitely brightens.  </li>
            <li> Oh, and that dark little freckle that used to look like a blemish?</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m not impressed by this new product</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m not impressed by this new product</li>
            <li> So the conclusion is that one little pump is all it takes to make your skin feel moist without being greasy.</li>
            <li> after four weeks of use, I see little difference.</li>
            <li> Stung a little bit&lt;</li>
            <li> Anyway, after using this line for a few weeks, all that did fade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but Roc retinol creams are a bit heavier and maybe a bit too heavy for day use.</li>
            <li> but I gave it a relatively low rating because it seemed a poor value.</li>
            <li> But, maybe, that would have a negative effect on the active ingredients.</li>
            <li> I recently tried and reviewed a very expensive face toner liquid from another company and of course, that serves a different function.</li>
            <li> I am a bit disappointed at the low level of SPF in this facial cream.  </li>
            <li> I guess she thought at the MSRP price point on the company website, it would prove quite a step up from her usual products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how others feel about this</li>
            <li> 15.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;re supposed to apply it at least 15 minutes before sun exposure and</li>
            <li> In my estimation, the cream is quite thick  </li>
            <li> Felt thick, but not in a moisturizing way&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Then it soaked into my skin, which obviously needed all that hydration due to the horrible weather we&#x27;ve been having.</li>
            <li> lotion absorbs into my skin and does not leave behind a greasy residue.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sadly, My skin doesn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> When I was deciding whether or not to try this product, I was unable to find an ingredient list (I didn&#x27;t want to use anything with hydroquinone), so I&#x27;m including a photo of the direction/ingredient panel with this review.</li>
            <li> As for the sunscreen portion of this lotion - I&#x27;m not impressed.</li>
            <li> Olay, unfortunately is a product I was always allergic too</li>
            <li> What this does is make the product useless in the warmer months since I can&#x27;t use it and do outdoor activities</li>
            <li> and I would get terrible burning rashes on my skin.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a nice cream that has helped fade my dark spots on my neck and hands, I can see a difference. It is not as heavy as the jar cream of this same brand but is still heavy. I have combination skin and do feel oily after a few hours with this cream, more so than usual. I did take off a star for this because it only has an SPF of 15, really since it says in the directions to not have sun exposure I would think the SPF should be higher. But, maybe, that would have a negative effect on the active ingredients. I use Retin-a at night and have not had a problem adding this to my morning routine even though my skin can be irritated easily. This does not do that. It is good, does what it says, I can tell after about 6 weeks of use my skin tone has evened out, but I do use a sunscreen powder over it because this products SPF is low.</li>
            <li> This is a really great addition to what is already one of the most high-quality lines of skin care products on the market. The lotion smooths the skin and does give it a luminous quality after only a week or so of daily use.</li>
            <li> This is a lightweight formula with spf 15 which is OK if you aren&#x27;t going to spend a lot of time in the sun. It definitely has a sunscreen appearance but disappears when applied to the face. I use another cream with this since it is not moisturizing enough for me. I have not seen any fading of my dark spots so maybe it hasn&#x27;t been long enough or it will only brighten your skin while wearing it. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with wearing it with makeup or alone. It is very lightweight and has not caused any skin problems for me. I do like that there is no real scent to it, no perfume smell to this one.</li>
            <li> Olay is a good brand and unless you have some sort of sensitivity to or allergic reaction to the ingredients in this product, it&#x27;s a moderate investment to see if the testing claims work for you. After several weeks of use, I can&#x27;t say that it lived up to its testing claims: I don’t think my skin looks “visibly younger” and I did not see that my skin was  “brighter, more glowing” or that my skin tone was “more even” as the testing claims say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t stand out or perform better than the other moisturizers (with and without sunscreens) I’ve been using over the years. (FYI: I&#x27;ve been using two brands consistently for daily and night moisurization, with and without sunscreen, for years and am happy with them. This may technically be more advanced but it didn&#x27;t seem that way in terms of my skin&#x27;s condition.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think how one views the efficacy of a skin moisturizer of any brand or type is very subjective and in one’s own mind and eyes as it were. I mean how can you really be scientific about all this when it’s about what you see/perceive? (Is the placebo effect at work on skincare products, not just those from Olay? I think so.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Possibly it works better if one invests the money and time in the whole Olay regimen but that’s not something I’m likely to do, for any brand. And if a product can’t work on its own, it won’t work in my personalized skin care regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62;Felt heavy and somewhat “sticky” on my skin; not as lightweight as other moisturizers&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62;Foundation was blotchy when applied over it&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62;Needs a higher SPF for one-time daily use&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62;Did not see any real benefits or change in skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plusses:&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62;Dries quickly on skin&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62;Pump dispenses an accurate amount to use</li>
            <li> Sadly, My skin doesn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> Love the product! Receive compliments about my skin glowing whenever I wear it alone or under makeup.</li>
            <li> The lotion feels great, both in application (rich and thick, but not too much so) and on the skin.  It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy, and it absorbs nicely.  It actually feels great.  The look is subtle, but it definitely brightens.  I can mix it with my foundation or use it on it&#x27;s own.  The only issue is that the SPF, while it&#x27;s nice, is way too low for my needs.  I&#x27;ll still need a way to get closer to spf 45 with another product.</li>
            <li> I am using this with the micro peel Olay product.  However, I did start it a little early before I got the Olay Micro Peel delivered.  So from the head start I could already tell what a difference my skin feels like.  I am only beginning on the second week. So to have a noticeable difference so soon says a lot about the product. I have also gotten some compliments on how good I look this past weekend. I do have a dark spot on my left cheek from too much sun exposure.  I am watching it to see if the product can fully brighten it and make it disappear.  I am not holding my breath on that much of a miracle as most spots that size can only disappear with laser light work.  But, you never know and  If it does totally disappear, I will update this review.  But, in the meantime, I can honestly say that my skin does feel better and does look better in only a short time. Marilyn</li>
            <li> See update at the end...&lt;br /&gt;This is my first Olay Regenerist product. I hear good things about this line so I was excited to try out this moisturizer for the Amazon Vine Program.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it everyday for the last two weeks. It takes two pumps to cover my face, neck and decollete. It feels fairly light but has that slight tightening and drying effect I get from other daily moisturizers with SPF. It is not bad, but I do notice it at times. So does it protect? Yes. I think a higher SPF would be better but even a 15 SPF will help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it lighten and brighten? Well, not that I can tell. I have a face full of freckles so there is no product that I know of that will diminish those. Maybe over a longer time you might see some more luminosity. I took one star off for this claim of more luminous skin which I sometimes think is just a marketing ploy. I want to think it is possible to get more of a glow from a moisturizer, but I know that your diet and hydration and even age can impact your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is good everyday moisturizer that I will probably continue using. I had no breakouts or allergic reactions like some other reviewers. I put my usual Bare Minerals make-up over top with no problems.&lt;br /&gt;**************************************&lt;br /&gt;Update: I have kept using this every day and the bottle is almost empty. While I still see no real luminous effects, I have still enjoyed this as my daily moisturizer. I am now considering ordering a 2nd bottle or trying out a different Regenerist lotion with SPF.</li>
            <li> I like Olay Regenerist products and this is no exception. It feels light weight on my skin and protects against sun burn with its SPF 15 sun block. I have to admit that as an older woman I do not expect a miracle in terms of line and wrinkle removal, and I am fortunate that I do not have brown spots on my face. I use it for the protection against the harmful rays of the sun, and as an extra bonus it does give my complexion a brighter look.</li>
            <li> I tried really hard to use this product long enough to give it a fair review, but it made my skin break out pretty badly, so I had to stop. It didn&#x27;t burn, though, which is unusual for me--most sunscreens hurt when I put them on my face. It felt nice and smooth.  When I was deciding whether or not to try this product, I was unable to find an ingredient list (I didn&#x27;t want to use anything with hydroquinone), so I&#x27;m including a photo of the direction/ingredient panel with this review. Cheers :)</li>
            <li> Years ago I used Olay products quite often, but this is the second one I’ve tried that made my sensitive facial skin look and feel worse.  So I really can’t effectively comment on how well this works on the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did apply this to a few spots on my arm to see if they really would fade and yes, I can see that they are somewhat lighter since I’ve been using it.  So that claim appears to be true.  It makes me think that if you don’t have sensitive skin, this could be a good product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the sunscreen element in it, yes, it’s thicker like sunscreens that contain zinc oxide, but the SPF is only 15 and needs to be applied every couple of hours to be effective.  But if you’re interested in this product’s other benefits, 15 is definitely better than something without SPF in it.</li>
            <li> My wife loved this product. The texture was a little too creamy but not enough to make her not want to use it. Her skin felt smooth and not greasy. You can wear it under makeup or by itself. There was very little fragrance which with her asthma she very much appreciated. Although some people have complained that it is only SPF 15, it really isn&#x27;t designed as a sunscreen. So the conclusion is that one little pump is all it takes to make your skin feel moist without being greasy. Definitely a new favorite for my wife.</li>
            <li> Olay Regenerist Luminous Brightening and Protecting Lotion with SP 15 seemed to be a good product to try for wintertime improvement. The SPF level of 15 is an appropriate level of sun protection if you aren&#x27;t out all day long in the winter. This winter my skin has been showing signs of dryness in spite of trying to beat it back. I needed a more effective moisturizer to help with my dry skin. The dry skin did seem to improve to some degree although, not completely. And I was looking forward to using a hypoallergenic product as I have very sensitive skin and I don&#x27;t use any product that is not for sensitive skin. This product delivered on that score.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The container the cream comes in is a nice hard side plastic dispenser that with a quick push dispenses a dose of moisturizer. In my estimation, the cream is quite thick  but it rubs in quite well. The package claims the cream is non-greasy and it&#x27;s right. It is absorbed right into the skin with no yucky residue. The cream is supposed to be good at fading brown spots but I don&#x27;t have any on my face. I do, however, have several light brown spots on my hands, so I used the cream on my hands. Frankly. after four weeks of use, I see little difference. Perhaps the cream would have been more effective had the spots had been darker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this lotion was not quite what I had expected it to be. I would not quite describe this as a true lotion. It is much thicker. It seems to be fine as long as I didn&#x27;t use too much or put anything but a thin layer of foundation on after I used the cream. I didn&#x27;t particularly like the directions to reapply the cream every two hours. I&#x27;ve got better things to do than reapply the cream four or five times a day. I want to be able to put the stuff on and forget it for the rest of the day. I must admit, I generally did forget it. I can&#x27;t say that I saw my skin get any more luminous or brighter. As for looking younger, I don&#x27;t have bunches of wrinkles to be dealt with. I have not subjected my skin to hours and hours in the sun nor smoked, so I don&#x27;t have that problem. My skin did feel softer and I did like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a nice product and if one&#x27;s skin needs a good moisturizer with a sun spot protector, this would be a good possibility.</li>
            <li> Very nice moisturizer with SPF too.  It adds a nice glow too.</li>
            <li> I use this Olay Regenerist Luminous Brightening and Protecting Lotion as a daily moisturizer and can say that for me it goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly. I&#x27;ve never used a moisturizer on a regular basis so I can&#x27;t compare this to any other product. What I can tell you is that I do have a fairly large sun spot on the side of my face and it does seem to be getting lighter. It&#x27;s a gradual lightening but it seems to be working. As for the sunscreen portion of this lotion - I&#x27;m not impressed. SPF 15 isn&#x27;t squat on protection and then you have to reapply it every 2 hours. Well, if you&#x27;re wearing makeup, how is that going to work for you?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, all in all, I like the product for a moisturizer but not a sunscreen.</li>
            <li> The Olay Regenerist Luminous brightening &amp; protecting lotion with sunscreen is another quality product made by Olay. When I use Olay products I always keep in mind that they spend huge amounts of money in research. This product includes niacinamide, which is used in cosmetics for anti-aging purposes. It supposedly has been demonstrated to protect skin from sun exposure, help fade discolorations, improve elasticity, tone, and texture. It also includes Vitamin B3, Pro-Vitamin B5, Vitamin E, and green tea, all good things. Amazingly in this world full of products known for their scents, this is fragrance free. It really is.  That&#x27;s a nice touch for those of us with severe allergies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on in a rich, creamy texture, so my face looked a little white for a minute. Then it soaked into my skin, which obviously needed all that hydration due to the horrible weather we&#x27;ve been having. My skin feels refreshed, more supple, and well protected against the elements. Broad Spectrum SPF 15.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;re supposed to apply it at least 15 minutes before sun exposure and then every 2 hours after that. If you&#x27;re wearing makeup, that could be a challenge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all, it&#x27;s a nice daytime moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Excellent light weight product.&lt;br /&gt;Goes on smoothly and not greasy at all.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I keep switching from my Olay 7 Effects - that stuff is perfect!&lt;br /&gt;This Regenerist Luminous Brighting spf15 wasn&#x27;t that hot.  I actually returned it to Wegmans about 20 minutes after I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Felt thick, but not in a moisturizing way&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Started to leave white &amp;#34;balls&amp;#34; on my cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Stung a little bit&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Just didn&#x27;t feel moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I kind of looked funny, like I had white eyeshadow spread all over my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not TERRIBLE, but it&#x27;s not good.  I recommend the 7 Effects all the way. I just wanted to see if I could find something even better than the best, but Luminous Brightening wasn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li> I am a bit disappointed at the low level of SPF in this facial cream.  Why only 15?  That&#x27;s not even long enough to get a person through the morning.  If you wear make-up, reapplying this cream after the sun protection has worn off is, well, not possible.  I don&#x27;t wear make-up, so it&#x27;s not a problem for me, but anyone considering the purchase of this product should factor that issue in.  I am pleased, however, that it does indeed seem to be fragrance-free.  Not even my cats notice or react to a scent.  I also find that it&#x27;s a bit thick in terms of its consistency, but others may not mind so much.  Therefore, I have stopped using this in the morning and now use it at night, where it works out just fine!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just not seeing the &amp;#34;brightening&amp;#34; effect that was advertised - &amp;#34;In just one use it visibly fades the look of dark spots for more even toned skin.&amp;#34;  I have used it for two weeks now without visible results. On the other hand it is seems to be a good moderate sunscreen.  I do like the way the push top delivers a small measured dose so it&#x27;s not so easy to end up with too much and a mess.  I am sensitive to most sunscreens, and I find I can wear this as long as I keep it away from and below my eyes so it is better than many I have tried.  It&#x27;s worth a try since it says 85% see visible results.</li>
            <li> A decent moisturizer that leaves your skin soft and healthy feeling without scent (which is nice), however haven&#x27;t had an opportunity to test the SPF qualities given the winter we&#x27;ve been having. Will check back when the sun comes out and stays out! So light that it feels good under makeup.</li>
            <li> I have used various cleansers and lotions from Olay&#x27;s Regenerist line and have been happy with most of them, so thought I would try this one out for use over the winter season. (Which shows no signs of ending soon here right now!) My thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I like the fact that this is a fragrance-free item since I am sensitive to perfumes.&lt;br /&gt;*The lotion goes on smoothly and feels great.&lt;br /&gt;*The lotion absorbs into my skin and does not leave behind a greasy residue.&lt;br /&gt;*The dispenser works well and delivers a reasonable dollop of lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*The SPF is very low (15) and I will limit use to days when I am primarily indoors because i like more protection when I am spending any length of time outdoors. Also the packaging says to reapply the lotion every 2 hours! Um, yeah that is going to happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I don&#x27;t have any very notable dark spots on my face, a few light ones only, and I have never had a over-the-counter product make them one iota lighter. I would not buy this product assuming it is going to get rid of dark spots and the claim it prevents them . . . well it has a low SPF that you are to reapply every 2 hours . . . sounds pretty suspect to me. (I am taking a full star off for the low SPF and the dark spot nonsense.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all, this is a very nice, light lotion for those who use it seasonally and avoid sun exposure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended with above reservations</li>
            <li> light, non-greasy. I am careful not to use this around my eyes, but I do that with all this sort of product. A doctor&#x27;s review here indicates that she had researched the ingredients that were contained in this product and felt good about all of them. This also makes me feel good about using the product.  Additional comments, is that when this product did get close to my eyes it did not make them water like some of these type of products do. Gave it 4 stars only because I felt it was a little pricey. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This line of products does work for lightening dark spots. When I started using it, I had a splatter of freckles that normally would fade in the winter, but they were always evident. I had one really dark one under my eye that looked, to me at least, like a big blackhead or something. Anyway, after using this line for a few weeks, all that did fade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a good daily sunscreen moisturizer. It is SPF 15. It comes in a tall, skinny bottle with a pump dispenser that works well. One pump is enough to cover my face well.  There are 2 pumps&#x27; worth in the picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes out as a very thick lotion, but in a thin stream, that is almost more a cream. It feels fairly thick, like a sunscreen more than a moisturizer, until I start spreading it out. It absorbs readily and feels just a tad bit greasy at first, but that quickly vanishes. It makes my skin feel very hydrated, and is an excellent base for my foundation. It causes no piling and makeup seems to just glide on and looks smoother WITH this moisturizer than without.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this product a lot, and also recommend the ProX Brightening Renewal Cream. Oh, and that dark little freckle that used to look like a blemish? It is now faded to the point where it&#x27;s barely visible and looks more like the very, very light little freckle it really is.</li>
            <li> I have used several of this line of products and really appreciated how well they work.  For me, I have sensitive skin and really work hard to use products without scents (plus, I really don&#x27;t want to &#x27;smell my face&#x27; all morning). This is truly fragrance free and doesn&#x27;t smell like the typical product with sun blocking ingredients (i.e., zinc oxide).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t attest to the luminosity affect - I don&#x27;t stare at my face a lot so I don&#x27;t have a frame of reference. But I can say that it goes on smoothly, absorbs quickly so I don&#x27;t have to wait to apply makeup, and wears well under the makeup. It&#x27;s also great on light days when I don&#x27;t want to wear makeup (e.g., weekends at home) and definitely don&#x27;t want to feel like I have product on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does make my skin feel softer and certainly it is more expensive than many over the counter products but still cheaper than e.g., Clinique (which I also use a lot and love).</li>
            <li> This is the first Olay product I have used that I have had any success with, primarily because this is the first product they have put out that is actually 100% scent free. (With the slight exception that the SPF 15 components of Avobenzone, Homosalate, Octisalate &amp; Octocrylene which have a natural scent.) Olay, unfortunately is a product I was always allergic too and I would get terrible burning rashes on my skin. An issue that continued with another so-called unscented Olay moisturizer that was in fact lightly scented and my rash was still there. So I am actually delighted that this company finally did put out a scent free moisturizer. As I have had no reaction it is clearly their signature fragrance that gives me fits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that out of the way, I can honestly say that this is an enjoyable product. There are a lot of SPF moisturizers that claim to be &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; so as not to be oily or greasy and in turn are very drying. Olay Regenerist has hit the perfect balance and covers wonderfully (a little does go a long way.) and maintains its moisture without drying out. I have worn this while out on my hikes and the SPF coverage also holds up well for several hours. I also found this to be reasonably priced (around 20 bucks) compared to higher end products which provide the same coverage. ($45 and up.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be sticking with this.</li>
            <li> Most of  the skin care products that my wife uses she gets from local beauty shops or department stores, but from time to time she&#x27;ll purchase something from a mass market retailer. In such cases, I&#x27;m most likely to see something like L&#x27;Oreal or a Neutrogena, you know, something familiar, cluttering up the vanity. When she saw I had the opportunity to get this upscale looking bottle of a new product from Olay, she really wanted to try it. I guess she thought at the MSRP price point on the company website, it would prove quite a step up from her usual products. Anyway, she said she had high expectations. Here&#x27;s the rest of what she said:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Because I have very sensitive skin with a lot of issues (oily, large pores, redness, wrinkles, age spots), I only use certain products, but I&#x27;m always experimenting with affordably priced products.&lt;br /&gt;This Olay Regenerist product boasts a broad spectrum SPF 15 sunscreen feature, but according to the directions on the back of the bottle, it must be reapplied every 2 hours. As my husband would say: \\&quot;Really?\\&quot; So, every two hours I have to redo my makeup, or foundation or both, just to get some sun protection? Again, as my husband would say, \\&quot;Yeah, no.\\&quot; And, SPF15 is not even a very high SPF factor. My favorite (and very inexpensive) cream, [[ASIN:B00DTQ12DQ Missha M Perfect Cover BB(Blemish Balm) Cream SPF 42 PA+++ 50ml No.31 Golden Beige]] and it works great. So, Olay may not be the product you want if you are looking for a lotion with decent sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Olay also says this is \\&quot;lightweight and non-greasy\\&quot;, but to me, it is much stickier than what I currently use, and I felt a little itchiness right after application. This may be because I tend to select skin care products for oily skin and this is not advertised as such. But I noticed that as time went by, my skin felt more and more greasy than when using my usual oily skin lotion. So, this product may not be what you want if you have oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being fragrance-free, this is preferable to a product having an unpleasant fragrance, but to me, a light, pleasant fragrance is preferable to none at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m not impressed by this new product and I don&#x27;t think I will continue to use this once it runs out.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So there you have the lady&#x27;s opinion. Now, I just have to remember to scratch this off the \\&quot;potential birthday presents and stocking stuffers\\&quot; list.fragrance-free, this is preferable to a product having an unpleasant fragrance, but to me, a light, pleasant fragrance is preferable to none at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m not impressed by this new product and I don&#x27;t think I will continue to use this once it runs out.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So there you have the lady&#x27;s opinion.

            <li> Regenerist by Olay and the retinol products from Roc are the best products, in my opinion, on the market today. Because the Regenerist products are so expensive, I&#x27;ve been using Roc a bit more than the Olay products but Roc retinol creams are a bit heavier and maybe a bit too heavy for day use. I like Regenerist for the daytime moisturizer and Roc for the night cream. Regenerist day creams absorb well and are generally lighter than what Roc makes so it&#x27;s easier to apply light makeup (in my case, mineral powder) to my skin without a sticky feeling. So on that, we&#x27;re in good shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I wish could change is the SPF 15. I&#x27;m not sure how others feel about this but I&#x27;d like to see this in at least an SPF 30 and possibly even higher but I think SPF 15 isn&#x27;t high enough for a product like this. What this does is make the product useless in the warmer months since I can&#x27;t use it and do outdoor activities - I&#x27;d have to buy a whole separate product with a better SPF. Which leads me to wondering why buy two products at all? I&#x27;d just go for the product with the higher SPF for year-round use instead of buying two separate products to wear at different times of the year. They do make higher SPF products, by the way. Perhaps with the ingredients that include brighteners, the higher SPF wouldn&#x27;t work as well? I&#x27;m not 100% on how skin brightening actually works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any case, I&#x27;m enjoying this product in the winter months and the application process is very nice - smooth and light and it dries quickly. There is a pump that dispenses the product in a specified amount that seems to be exactly enough to cover the face, throat, and part of my collarbone area. My skin looks good in combination with the Roc night cream and has a silky feel to it, almost like a freshly exfoliated feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the product but had to take off points for the SPF 15 since I probably won&#x27;t actually buy this unless the raise the SPF to at least a 30. The price on this is also much better than other Regenerist products so it&#x27;s a shame I can&#x27;t really use this on a year-round basis.so much better than other Regenerist products so it&#x27;s a shame I can&#x27;t really use this on a year-round basis.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the regular Olay Regenerist Serum for about ten years, ever since I first heard about it from Paula Begoun and Dr. Leslie Baumann, who each recommend it for sensitive skin.  I&#x27;m always on the hunt for products that brighten the skin since, at the age of 43, my skin needs a bit of help in the glow department.  I&#x27;ve been using this new lotion for over two weeks now, and I really like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite things about it are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*  It contains particles that add an an immediate glow to your skin.  There are no sparkles, so your skin just looks natural and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*  The inclusion of niacinimide as one of the main ingredients means that, long-term, this will brighten up dark spots and fade blotchy patches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*  It doesn&#x27;t irritate my super-sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*  It really is fragrance-free.  I recently tried another Olay product that claimed to be FF, but it set off my allergies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*  It plays nicely under makeup, and doesn&#x27;t cause your foundation to pill or ball up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only real negative for me is that the SPF is only 15, and my dermatologist has told me to use at least an SPF 25 or higher.  If they could re-formulate it with a higher SPF, it would be perfect for year-round use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I really like this, and will be on the lookout for a higher SPF version of this hopefully in the near future.</li>
            <li> While this lotion isn&#x27;t greasy, I disagree that it&#x27;s light - it has an almost sticky feel about it, and though I didn&#x27;t notice the pilling/balling up of my makeup that others mentioned, it definitely doesn&#x27;t lend toward lasting makeup application. Makeup that normally lasts me all day seemed to not really stick to my skin at all when applied on top of this moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, while I&#x27;m sure the lack of the usual lotion-type scents helps those who are very sensitive to that, I personally prefer some sort of light scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, my skin does feel softer after using this every day for a week or so. I don&#x27;t notice any changes in my skin tone/brightness, but I assume those would take much longer.</li>
            <li> I first tried Olay moisturizing products several years ago after seeing Consumer Reports gave their Regenerist line one of the highest ratings of all those they tested, besting products several times as expensive. Since then it&#x27;s the only line I&#x27;ve been using and I continue to be extremely happy with it. Living in the southeast in the sunshine state, I try to make certain that I never leave the house without sunscreen and so appreciate that in addition to the excellent moisturizing effects, that I don&#x27;t need to apply a separate sunscreen. SPF 15 is a bare minimum, and if I know I&#x27;ll be outside in direct sunlight, I do switch to their moisturizer that has SPF 30, though that contains Zinc Oxide and is more noticeably white on the skin. I had been using this Total Effects formula in it&#x27;s night cream form and found it made my skin remarkably smooth, even more effectively so then the simple pure oils I had been using in the past, like Emu Oil and Argan Oil. After using this incarnation a few weeks as my daily moisturizer I can report that it also is another outstanding Olay product. It&#x27;s extremely light and spreads quickly and evenly over my face. I find the amount dispensed in just one pump is enough to cover the whole face and neck and so it should last a while and be a good value as well. I appreciate that it&#x27;s also fragrance free. I recently tried and reviewed a very expensive face toner liquid from another company and of course, that serves a different function. I liked the product but I gave it a relatively low rating because it seemed a poor value. I mention that only because I appreciate that Olay products have been impressively effective for my skin but at a reasonable price also and so consider it a very good value. Very happy with this new product for it&#x27;s light weight, it gives the skin a visibly hydrated appearance, it continues the positive effects I&#x27;ve been appreciating from it&#x27;s related Total Effects Night Cream and it&#x27;s reasonable price. I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to comment on it&#x27;s lightening of dark spots,, but it does give my face a &amp;#34;luminous&amp;#34; appearance as the name includes.it long enough to comment on it&#x27;s lightening of dark spots,, but it does give my face a &amp;#34;luminous&amp;#34; appearance as the name includes.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer was non-greasy and made my skin feel soft on contact!  Only used a pea sized amount for entire face.  Great to wear alone or under make-up.</li>
            <li> *There are Olay products I have used and love---but this one wasn&#x27;t one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a day product, and it has SPF. Unfortunately it is the kind of SPF chemical that makes my face red, itchy, swollen, and peely! On top of that it wasn&#x27;t very moisturizing, it had a typical thick white SPF-y consistency. My makeup (Estee Lauder Double Wear, VERY forgiving product) looked like separated curds after a few hours. Patchy and gross.  Within a few hours my eyebrows were red and snarly from the extreme itching of my skin almost driving me insane!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are other day cream products I like, DDF Moisturizing Dew or Olay Regenerist MicroSculpting is even good (no SPF). I am using an Estee Lauder product that I like but price-wise it&#x27;s probably 4x the price of the Olay Luminous so I won&#x27;t even compare them. I just know this particular Olay product caused an allergic reaction and then underperformed as an under-makeup product to boot.</li>
