            <li>Good product.  </li>
            <li>Like another reviewer, I, too loved this product BEFORE the formula change.</li>

            <li>have never had an &#x27;allergic&#x27; reaction to any product - shame on AO for messing with a good thing.</li>

            <li>Good shave, smells good &amp; face nice &amp; smooth after.  </li>
            <li>Honestly I think this stuff is a hazard.</li>
            <li>it has a wonderful consistency and you don&#x27;t have to use much at all.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t break out from this and get a nice close shave.  </li>
            <li>I could not disagree more - but to each his own.  </li>

            <li>No more razor rash, smells great, what a wonderful product.</li>

            <li>I love these shaving creams; they beat the stuff that comes in a</li>
            <li>I love this shaving cream.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>Very clean smell.</li>
            <li>Great natural product that keeps you healthy.</li>
            <li>In my search for more chemical free products, I came across this shave cream.  </li>
            <li>On the quality of the cream, it is really quite good.</li>
            <li>This shaving cream is the best of all, hands down.  </li>
            <li>and it creates a smooth, non-foamy surface for the razor to glide over.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my legs feeling moisturized, smooth, and comfortable.  </li>
            <li>It actually moisturizes as well as providing a great shave.</li>
            <li>Works well, odor free as stated.  </li>
            <li>Wonderfully smooth.</li>
            <li>Avalon&#x27;s Aloe-Unscented cream shave is far superior to anything else I&#x27;ve used, including the \\&quot;unscented\\&quot; Aveeno gel.  </li>
            <li>but this is an original for hubby shave purchase</li>
            <li>Love that it has natural ingredients, and love that it is unscented.</li>
            <li>I finally tried the Avalon Cream Shave and loved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The shipping was quick and the product came as advertised.</li>
            <li>have used this product for years - was my favorite shave cream - just bought 4 new tubes - but AO has changed the formula (verified with AO customer service)!&lt;br /&gt;New</li>
            <li>been using this for a few years now and it makes my skin feel great and helps with irritation.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It offers more skin protection and lubrication than any shaving cream or foam</li>
            <li>This is definitely worth the money.  </li>
            <li>and talking about money, this stuff is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I found it a local health food store and liked it right away.</li>
            <li>the positive reviews are right on the money.</li>
            <li>Results are smooth soft legs.</li>
            <li>My skin does very well with this shaving cream!</li>
            <li>Love it and use it daily</li>
            <li>It offers a smooth shave without any burn.</li>
            <li>formula left my face red, swollen, hot and irritated - like I had a sunburn or chemical peel - for a good hour after my shave.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I got what I expected, it was fast shipping, and I paid less than most places :)</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much product (I usually use a bit more than a pea-sized amount per leg in the shower)</li>
            <li>and it was more than enough, and I never cut myself shaving even though i use my razors for a long time.</li>
            <li>The lavender scented one stings me, but this one (the Aloe Unscented) is very soothing and works better than the usual shaving gels on the shelves these days.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m searching for a new product.</li>
            <li>Now, with the new formula, I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s any better than water alone.</li>
            <li>Before buying this product, I was using a foaming shave gel made by Aveeno which was supposedly for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>This is far from it.</li>
            <li>Hubby has used for years in complete replacement for shaving foam.  </li>
            <li>With the old product, i felt like I could use the tiniest amount</li>
            <li>I feel like no matter how much I use, it is not enough.</li>
            <li>My husband, who has sensitive skin, loves this stuff.</li>
            <li>It leaves my face soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>you have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I tried this product because of sensitive skin, it passes with flying colors.  </li>
            <li>only reason I can justify two stars is because of the natural ingredients and that it&#x27;s not very expensive.</li>
            <li>This is the first shaving lotion/cream/whatever that I have ever found that gives me a close shave and doesn&#x27;t dry out or irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>Love the smooth texture and absence of crazy scents.</li>
            <li>Way less ingrown hairs and practically no razor burn even when he really needs to change out his razors.  </li>

            <li> I actually prefer the one with a slight mint flavor, but the shave is all the same.</li>
            <li> long as Avalon Organics makes this cream shave, I&#x27;ll use it!</li>
            <li> I little goes a long way</li>
            <li> The cream simply smoothes on, I usually use just about 2 pea sized amounts of the cream and apply to my beard.</li>
            <li> I had been searching for a shave cream which did not have perfumes or other additives which would cause my face to break out from shaving.</li>
            <li> lasts a long time, as u need only a very small amount.</li>
            <li> I was highly skeptical and not particularly eager to try the product mainly because it did not produce a foamy lather.  </li>
            <li> at least they didn&#x27;t last I checked.</li>
            <li> The product remains in the blades until rinsed, NEVER running down to the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I spend half the time rinsing it off of the handle of my razor.</li>
            <li> for the single negative review posted here</li>
            <li> I ordered 3 bottles, and each one lasts for a year, since you need so little.</li>
            <li> can hands down!</li>
            <li> You use very little per shave.</li>
            <li> Finally no more razor burn.</li>
            <li> Apparently their customers were feeling nostalgic and wanted to be reminded of the first, bloody time they shaved.</li>
            <li> I see some reviews complained about it being too slipper</li>
            <li> All without contaminating myself with artificial ingredients.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The package arrived in good condition</li>
            <li> This is my favorite shave gel. It doesnt have harmful chemicals. Results are smooth soft legs. No nicks or cuts.</li>
            <li> Before buying this product, I was using a foaming shave gel made by Aveeno which was supposedly for sensitive skin.  Avalon&#x27;s Aloe-Unscented cream shave is far superior to anything else I&#x27;ve used, including the \\&quot;unscented\\&quot; Aveeno gel.  You don&#x27;t need much product (I usually use a bit more than a pea-sized amount per leg in the shower) and it creates a smooth, non-foamy surface for the razor to glide over.  Leaves my legs feeling moisturized, smooth, and comfortable.  Finally no more razor burn.</li>
            <li> Initially, my wife urged me to try this product to shave my face.  I was highly skeptical and not particularly eager to try the product mainly because it did not produce a foamy lather.  I finally tried the Avalon Cream Shave and loved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It offers more skin protection and lubrication than any shaving cream or foam I have tried to date and I get closer shaves than ever before.  All without contaminating myself with artificial ingredients. It actually moisturizes as well as providing a great shave. One feature I especially enjoy is that it is truly unscented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the single negative review posted here I could not disagree more - but to each his own.  The cream simply smoothes on, I usually use just about 2 pea sized amounts of the cream and apply to my beard. The product remains in the blades until rinsed, NEVER running down to the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product and good value.  One tube lasts about 3 months with both my wife and I using it.  Your mileage may vary.</li>
            <li> Best natural shaving cream that I&#x27;ve ever found.  Really good price if you buy the 3 count package.  Good shave, smells good &amp; face nice &amp; smooth after.  No skin breakouts, etc.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for the perfect shaving cream for a couple years. This is far from it. This is not a shaving cream. It&#x27;s a shaving lotion. Don&#x27;t even try and use a shaving brush with it. You just slather this stuff on your face (or whatever) and go to town.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a lotion this stuff really isn&#x27;t good for shaving the face. I spend half the time rinsing it off of the handle of my razor. If you don&#x27;t continually rinse it off your razor handle the razor is going to shoot out of your hand because of how slippery it gets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I can justify two stars is because of the natural ingredients and that it&#x27;s not very expensive. Honestly I think this stuff is a hazard.</li>
            <li> best shaving cream ever, love it, a friend gave me some years ago and I keep ordering more from amazon&lt;br /&gt;No bumps, smells great. No allergic rashes.</li>
            <li> This is definitely worth the money.  I see some reviews complained about it being too slipper but I disagree...it has a wonderful consistency and you don&#x27;t have to use much at all.  I don&#x27;t break out from this and get a nice close shave.  For those of you who are looking for healthy alternatives to regular shaving cream, get this one, you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving for almost forty years, and I&#x27;ve used lots of different shaving gels, creams, and foams.  I&#x27;ve used mass market products and boutique products, cheap and expensive products.  This shaving cream is the best of all, hands down.  It lubricates my beard well, protects against nicks, and leaves my skin soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As long as Avalon Organics makes this cream shave, I&#x27;ll use it!</li>
            <li> this is a great product. it helps a lot in the shaving process. The fact that it comes in 3 pack is great, cause i give one to my father in law . Very good quality !!</li>
            <li> I had been searching for a shave cream which did not have perfumes or other additives which would cause my face to break out from shaving. This product has excellent texture and smoothness, causing no irritation during daily shaving.</li>
            <li> I love these shaving creams; they beat the stuff that comes in a can hands down! I actually prefer the one with a slight mint flavor, but the shave is all the same. I recommend this without hesitation.</li>
            <li> Hubby has used for years in complete replacement for shaving foam.  Way less ingrown hairs and practically no razor burn even when he really needs to change out his razors.  1 tube will last a long time. You use very little per shave. unisex smell. It&#x27;s good for my lady legs too but this is an original for hubby shave purchase</li>
            <li> My husband has used this for years, and it seems to be the only shave cream that does not irritate his skin. Love that it has natural ingredients, and love that it is unscented.</li>
            <li> Works well, odor free as stated.  Good product.  Gives a close shave. I would recommend this product for men or women.</li>
            <li> Like another reviewer, I, too loved this product BEFORE the formula change. With the old product, i felt like I could use the tiniest amount and it was more than enough, and I never cut myself shaving even though i use my razors for a long time. Now, with the new formula, I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s any better than water alone. I feel like no matter how much I use, it is not enough. The razor no longer glides over my skin. I get cuts. I emailed the company to see if it was a fluke and they told me they sometimes change their products to meet consumer demands. Apparently their customers were feeling nostalgic and wanted to be reminded of the first, bloody time they shaved. Boooooo! I&#x27;m searching for a new product.</li>
            <li> been using this for a few years now and it makes my skin feel great and helps with irritation. I little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I got what I expected, it was fast shipping, and I paid less than most places :) Can&#x27;t complain about that! I love this shaving cream. The lavender scented one stings me, but this one (the Aloe Unscented) is very soothing and works better than the usual shaving gels on the shelves these days.</li>
            <li> For me, the best cream shave in the market today. I ordered 3 bottles, and each one lasts for a year, since you need so little. Excellent value-for-money from a well-reputed organic company. Kudos!</li>
            <li> Love the smooth texture and absence of crazy scents. My skin does very well with this shaving cream! My fave!</li>
            <li> Best shave cream ever.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just reordered this and must say that this is the best shaving cream i have ever used. . .all the positive reviews are right on the money. and talking about money, this stuff is worth every penny. lasts a long time, as u need only a very small amount. knowing that is also preservative free makes it just about perfect!</li>
            <li> My husband, who has sensitive skin, loves this stuff. Great price on the 3 pack.</li>
            <li> This shave cream is an excellent product. I found it a local health food store and liked it right away. The pricing on Amazon is comparable (does not seem any variation wherever you may look). The shipping was quick and the product came as advertised. On the quality of the cream, it is really quite good. It leaves my face soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> Love it and use it daily</li>
            <li> Wonderfully smooth. Very clean smell. Both my husband and I have been using this for years. Great natural product that keeps you healthy.</li>
            <li> Beware!&lt;br /&gt;I have used this product for years - was my favorite shave cream - just bought 4 new tubes - but AO has changed the formula (verified with AO customer service)!&lt;br /&gt;New formula left my face red, swollen, hot and irritated - like I had a sunburn or chemical peel - for a good hour after my shave.&lt;br /&gt;I have never had an &#x27;allergic&#x27; reaction to any product - shame on AO for messing with a good thing.</li>
            <li> In my search for more chemical free products, I came across this shave cream.  So happy that we did.. It offers a smooth shave without any burn. My wife has also started to use this great product and I am sure we will be sticking with this...</li>
            <li> This is the first shaving lotion/cream/whatever that I have ever found that gives me a close shave and doesn&#x27;t dry out or irritate my skin. I absolutely love it. My mom has a lot of sensitivities as well so I gave her a bottle to try and she loves it as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have sensitive skin I would highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like that Avalon Organics does not do animal testing... or at least they didn&#x27;t last I checked.</li>
            <li> I tried this product because of sensitive skin, it passes with flying colors.  No more razor rash, smells great, what a wonderful product.</li>
