            <li>She thought it looked great and couldn&#x27;t believe the price.</li>
            <li>Great wig.  </li>
            <li>You get what you pay for, so I am happy.</li>
            <li>I bought this wig for a convention and it was amazing!</li>
            <li>Gorgeous color and the quality is great.</li>
            <li>Good style though.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend saw it and loved it.</li>
            <li>And the purple is so gorgeous.</li>
            <li>The wig fits great (the bangs kind of get in the way</li>
            <li>Awesome fit, cut, and length.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s good agian</li>
            <li>I had to alter the style for my cosplay but the curls held nicely, and look great</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t know what a good quality wig should look like.</li>
            <li>(via my girlfriend who I bought it for) For the price the quality is good.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, my husband understands this sort of thing!!</li>
            <li>Will order more!</li>
            <li>now I&#x27;m ordering more colors!</li>
            <li>Great for cosplaying and that is exactly what it will be used for, so we are really happy.</li>
            <li>was hoping for a deeper purple color like the photo but its more bright purple.</li>
            <li>This wig is amazing.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I think I would wear it to work if I thought I could get away with it.</li>
            <li>Bangs are cut nicely and the curls have lots of bounce.</li>
            <li>The wig is very easy to maintain.</li>
            <li>but I love taking pictures with it on and just looks better with filter.</li>
            <li>I gotta say I LOVE THIS THING.</li>
            <li>and I got so many compliments.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>More wads of hair.  </li>
            <li>Mostly because of the time I put into the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So I just throw it in the top of the guest room closet.  </li>
            <li>have A LOT of hair, and it almost all fit in the with a cap on!</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it looked really cute</li>
            <li>I wore this as part of a princess costume  and enjoy having purple hair for a day!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great wig for a costume, not so much if you wanted to wear it out and what not, but then again, colored wigs are always risky for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The wig is ok for the price, but if it&#x27;s not parted perfectly, you can totally see the netting underneath the hair.</li>
            <li>It fit the character&#x27;s hair color and the style!</li>
            <li>so make sure you cover the edges of the wig.</li>
            <li>It does look like the picture for the most part.</li>
            <li>, this shipped this so freaking fast!!!!</li>
            <li>It held up well and surprisingly didn&#x27;t feel hot.</li>
            <li>Such a beautiful wig, well styled out of the bag, great quality, fantastic color, very shiny!</li>
            <li>, that will look cool!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to brush out and restyling was easy too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m easy to please like that.</li>
            <li>Get&#x27;s tangled easily</li>
            <li>All and all, easy 4 stars.</li>
            <li>And huge chunks of hair begin to come out.  </li>
            <li>huge clumps all over the floor.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is fully adjustable and comfortable.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth more than what you&#x27;ll pay for it.</li>
            <li>Comfortable.</li>
            <li>Great for occasional costume/ cosplay.</li>
            <li>It fit my need as a costume</li>
            <li>I purchased it when I had an issue with my original Halloween wig purchase.</li>
            <li>, I was so excited.  </li>
            <li>Its ok for a cheap wig, gets tangly fast.</li>
            <li>love it, nice and long.</li>
            <li>Good quality, built in hair net.</li>
            <li>You really can&#x27;t ask for more at this price</li>
            <li>I bought a different wig from the same company and was so impressed that when I was showing a friend the line, I couldn&#x27;t help myself.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just from being manufactured, they always shed just a bit when they&#x27;re new, then they settle  down.&amp;#34;  Comb a bit more...</li>
            <li>The curls are really nice and the long hair is fun!</li>
            <li>Overall, this is an amazing product.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li>Green is my favorite color, kind of Martian looking.  </li>
            <li>Such a nice Royal color</li>
            <li>The hair is soft unlike most colored wigs.</li>
            <li>Anyways, this is an amazing quality wig for an incredibly low price, and there are quite a few gorgeous colors to choose from.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping</li>
            <li>I was happily surprised at how good the quality is for how low the price was.</li>
            <li>I put her on my mannequin head and get my soft wig brush, and brush gently from bottom to top.  </li>
            <li>I fine that it easily tangles as does any not real wigs do.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a really pretty color</li>
            <li>This was the first wig I had ever gotten to play with.</li>
            <li>The quality and feel were far better than I expected and WAAAY better than anything you can find in a Halloween store or department-</li>
            <li>for the same or better price</li>
            <li>People actually thought it was my real hair! :-)</li>
            <li>Pretty wig after wearing a couple times just gets tangled on the ends still pretty though.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll try to incorporate it into another costume in the future!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li>Amazingly fast!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I really want to get some more in different colors.</li>
            <li>this is a lovely wig, but is only 32&amp;#34; if you stretch the curl out straight.</li>
            <li>, I love them long.  </li>
            <li>I blew dry it, and curled it myself and it looked okay.  </li>
            <li>Very vibrant purple.</li>
            <li>If you part them a certain way you can kinda see the hair netting.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t mind massive shedding, and you&#x27;re not picky about the shade, it should be fine for you.</li>
            <li>Its soft like real hair, not as much curl as the pic, but exactly what i needed for my Leela costume Idea!</li>
            <li>Very shiny and plastic-looking, though.</li>
            <li>But I really wanted it curled like in the picture.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying more of these in different colors, and I will definitely be purchasing more items from this seller.</li>
            <li>The wig fits perfectly thanks to the adjustable wig cap.</li>
            <li>This is very tangle-prone wig.</li>
            <li>So it arrived really fast</li>
            <li>/&gt;Personally, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this...too much work to put into for what $10 will get you at a costume shop.</li>
            <li>The wig is wiggy-like so don&#x27;t think this wig will look like your real hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Would be nice to a costume or just a few uses</li>
            <li>and the bangs are...really unrealistic to style, but for my first wig purchase ever, it was great.</li>
            <li>The wig I received (after a VERY long shipping wait) was a very BRIGHT medium purple - much closer to a &amp;#34;neon&amp;#34; purple than the deep dark violet of...</li>
            <li>and I really had to push the bangs around to make them look normal and had to trim them so they didn&#x27;t hang in front of my eyes.</li>
            <li>so I recently purchased my second one in the same color, and the second one is much much much more vivid, which isnt going to help me since I need to sew them together to get more volume.</li>
            <li>I do like this wig, but there are more negative than positive.</li>
            <li>Super long.</li>
            <li>This wig is nice for only a few times of use.</li>
            <li>It was good for what it was bought for a costume that was to be worn to multiple event; don&#x27;t expect to get only a couple of wears out of it before it becomes a matted mess.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s SUPER long and really soft</li>
            <li>Blue is pretty.  </li>
            <li>I tore open the package, and the first thing I notice was the color.  </li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t really recommend enough.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so long and pretty.</li>
            <li>To me, it doesn&#x27;t look natural</li>
            <li>You really can&#x27;t do much with trimming the bangs without the underlying net popping out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would really recommend avoiding this wig unless you only plan on using it once.</li>
            <li>First, the wig won&#x27;t cover up all my hair (my hair is black, so it is very noticeable), so I have to fix it every hour or so.</li>
            <li>Decent product, but it will not hold up to regular wear over time.</li>
            <li>Probably not great for long term wear but is good quality for costumes.</li>
            <li>I paid extra money to have it delivered on time and was highly upset.  </li>
            <li>The hair color is exactly what I had expected.</li>
            <li>it looks too fake and only looks good in pictures with filter.</li>
            <li>The quality is high for such a low price.  </li>
            <li>it in the front as it&#x27;s definitely sized for an adult</li>
            <li>It was much shorter than I expected from the photo and description.</li>
            <li>the hair is thick, curly, feels silky smooth and is the color shown.</li>
            <li>The wig overall is very nice, however it  is a little thin</li>
            <li>I wear a lot of black, and purple goes nice with black, so I decided on the dark purple.</li>
            <li>The wig cap is white (why white and not black or tan?</li>
            <li>Amazon would not ship the black one, and they were very unclear about why.</li>
            <li>The wefts and wig cap were as expected for this price, the basic non-stretchy mesh all over with small circle of center skin top.</li>
            <li>so you have to be careful not to pull all of the hair forward over your shoulders but other than that it was exactly what I wanted..</li>

            <li> If you don&#x27;t mind massive shedding, and you&#x27;re not picky about the shade, it should be fine for you.</li>
            <li> Its soft like real hair, not as much curl as the pic, but exactly what i needed for my Leela costume Idea!</li>
            <li> Very shiny and plastic-looking, though.</li>
            <li> But I really wanted it curled like in the picture.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying more of these in different colors, and I will definitely be purchasing more items from this seller.</li>
            <li> The wig fits perfectly thanks to the adjustable wig cap.</li>
            <li> This is very tangle-prone wig.</li>
            <li> So it arrived really fast</li>
            <li> /&gt;Personally, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this...too much work to put into for what $10 will get you at a costume shop.</li>
            <li> The wig is wiggy-like so don&#x27;t think this wig will look like your real hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Would be nice to a costume or just a few uses</li>
            <li> and the bangs are...really unrealistic to style, but for my first wig purchase ever, it was great.</li>
            <li> The wig I received (after a VERY long shipping wait) was a very BRIGHT medium purple - much closer to a &amp;#34;neon&amp;#34; purple than the deep dark violet of...</li>
            <li> and I really had to push the bangs around to make them look normal and had to trim them so they didn&#x27;t hang in front of my eyes.</li>
            <li> so I recently purchased my second one in the same color, and the second one is much much much more vivid, which isnt going to help me since I need to sew them together to get more volume.</li>
            <li> I do like this wig, but there are more negative than positive.</li>
            <li> Super long.</li>
            <li> This wig is nice for only a few times of use.</li>
            <li> It was good for what it was bought for a costume that was to be worn to multiple event; don&#x27;t expect to get only a couple of wears out of it before it becomes a matted mess.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s SUPER long and really soft</li>
            <li> Blue is pretty.  </li>
            <li> I tore open the package, and the first thing I notice was the color.  </li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t really recommend enough.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so long and pretty.</li>
            <li> To me, it doesn&#x27;t look natural</li>
            <li> You really can&#x27;t do much with trimming the bangs without the underlying net popping out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would really recommend avoiding this wig unless you only plan on using it once.</li>
            <li> First, the wig won&#x27;t cover up all my hair (my hair is black, so it is very noticeable), so I have to fix it every hour or so.</li>
            <li> Decent product, but it will not hold up to regular wear over time.</li>
            <li> Probably not great for long term wear but is good quality for costumes.</li>
            <li> I paid extra money to have it delivered on time and was highly upset.  </li>
            <li> The hair color is exactly what I had expected.</li>
            <li> it looks too fake and only looks good in pictures with filter.</li>
            <li> The quality is high for such a low price.  </li>
            <li> it in the front as it&#x27;s definitely sized for an adult</li>
            <li> It was much shorter than I expected from the photo and description.</li>
            <li> the hair is thick, curly, feels silky smooth and is the color shown.</li>
            <li> The wig overall is very nice, however it  is a little thin</li>
            <li> I wear a lot of black, and purple goes nice with black, so I decided on the dark purple.</li>
            <li> The wig cap is white (why white and not black or tan?</li>
            <li> Amazon would not ship the black one, and they were very unclear about why.</li>
            <li> The wefts and wig cap were as expected for this price, the basic non-stretchy mesh all over with small circle of center skin top.</li>
            <li> so you have to be careful not to pull all of the hair forward over your shoulders but other than that it was exactly what I wanted..</li>
            <li> The curls arrived a little messy, and in the generic flat plastic bag with little packaging to keep it safe on its long journey to the USA.</li>
            <li> Sure there are a few little tears in the weft of the wig but those are mostly due to some rough handling it got when I was traveling.</li>
            <li> I had wanted a wig of color for a long time.</li>
            <li> It took me a long time,...</li>
            <li> so the hair is extremely long in the front and can be bothersome to keep off the face.</li>
            <li> But the tangling is to be expected with such a long wig.</li>
            <li> For the price this wig is surprisingly thick, soft, and not really shiny like some lesser wigs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> several weeks to nail down the color.  </li>
            <li> Second, it gets very messy after the first usage if you&#x27;re not super careful with it, so now mine is all messy hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very long!</li>
            <li> After a single use the entire inside of the wig is a tangled matted mess!  </li>
            <li> I still how it and will use it again, but just not very often.</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s a bit, disheveled, from being in the box, so I grab my wide toothed wig comb, and start at the bottom, working my way up... holding the wig against me.</li>
            <li> I bought it in dark purple.</li>
            <li> Also, on my screen it appears to be a dark violet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 5&#x27;2&amp;#34; and it&#x27;s way down to my hips.</li>
            <li> I ordered two of these wigs, a purple and a black.</li>
            <li> I also received this wig in less than half of the estimated time.</li>
            <li> I am slightly disapointed in that fact.</li>
            <li> The only little area that some picky people might have a serious problem with is where the bangs part.</li>
            <li> It does tangle a little, but nothing severe.</li>
            <li> For the price, I was a little worried....</li>
            <li> It was a little thin at the cap in the back</li>
            <li> I got this wig for a cosplay a few months ago.</li>
            <li> a few bobby pins won&#x27;t fix).</li>
            <li> The other big problem is that it is very thin.</li>
            <li> Not sure how it is with heat but with the way it looks I&#x27;m kinda too scared to try.</li>
            <li> It is so thick and curly.</li>
            <li> I mean, as soon as I pulled the wig out of the packaging, the curls literally sprung into place.</li>
            <li> Also seems a bit thin.</li>

            <li> I do like this wig, but there are more negative than positive. First, the wig won&#x27;t cover up all my hair (my hair is black, so it is very noticeable), so I have to fix it every hour or so. Second, it gets very messy after the first usage if you&#x27;re not super careful with it, so now mine is all messy hair. I still how it and will use it again, but just not very often. Good style though.</li>
            <li> Great for cosplay. Difficult to untangle.</li>
            <li> Beautiful wig, I plan on buying others from this seller.</li>
            <li> This wig is nice for only a few times of use. You can&#x27;t brush through or put a iron through this hair. I fine that it easily tangles as does any not real wigs do.&lt;br /&gt;Would be nice to a costume or just a few uses</li>
            <li> Such a beautiful wig, well styled out of the bag, great quality, fantastic color, very shiny! Super fast shipping and I can&#x27;t really recommend enough.  I bought a different wig from the same company and was so impressed that when I was showing a friend the line, I couldn&#x27;t help myself.  I don&#x27;t have a specific use for it but I NEED their purple cosplay wig! Fortunately, my husband understands this sort of thing!!</li>
            <li> I ordered two of these wigs, a purple and a black. Amazon would not ship the black one, and they were very unclear about why. Eventually they just deleted the purchase, Never received it, but i did receive the purple wig at a completely different time than they had told me i would. AND I have no idea if they took money out of my account for it or not. DO NOT TRUST.</li>
            <li> Keeps curl beautifully. Very shiny and plastic-looking, though.</li>
            <li> It was a little thin at the cap in the back so you have to be careful not to pull all of the hair forward over your shoulders but other than that it was exactly what I wanted.. Wore it for a wig night on our belly dance party cruise and everyone loved it!</li>
            <li> I gave it 2 stars because I can&#x27;t wear it outside it looks too fake and only looks good in pictures with filter. I was disappointed in the color but I love taking pictures with it on and just looks better with filter.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really pretty color but I guess I was one of the unlucky ones to find that the wig wasn&#x27;t curly like in the picture. It&#x27;s SUPER long and really soft so I guess that&#x27;s a plus. But I really wanted it curled like in the picture. disappointed in that area.</li>
            <li> I gotta say I LOVE THIS THING. It looks great, feels great, fits great. It was far longer than I expected. This was the first wig I had ever gotten to play with. The color was great. Honestly, I think I would wear it to work if I thought I could get away with it. lol. I purchased it when I had an issue with my original Halloween wig purchase. My husband got a kick out of it too. I really want to get some more in different colors. The quality and feel were far better than I expected and WAAAY better than anything you can find in a Halloween store or department-for the same or better price I should mention.&lt;br /&gt;It is fully adjustable and comfortable. I wore it all day. It held up well and surprisingly didn&#x27;t feel hot. My girlfriend saw it and loved it. She thought it looked great and couldn&#x27;t believe the price. I had to show her where on Amazon to find them.</li>
            <li> I got this wig for a cosplay a few months ago. I was happily surprised at how good the quality is for how low the price was. Sure there are a few little tears in the weft of the wig but those are mostly due to some rough handling it got when I was traveling. It&#x27;s easy to brush out and restyling was easy too. It&#x27;s definitely worth more than what you&#x27;ll pay for it.</li>
            <li> This wig...is abso-friggin-lutely incredible. It is so thick and curly. I mean, as soon as I pulled the wig out of the packaging, the curls literally sprung into place. And the purple is so gorgeous. The pictures online do not do it justice. I also received this wig in less than half of the estimated time. I was so shocked when I went to the post office and it was there since it was estimated to be delivered between Nov 29th-Dec 15th or so. I will definitely be buying more of these in different colors, and I will definitely be purchasing more items from this seller. The only little area that some picky people might have a serious problem with is where the bangs part. If you part them a certain way you can kinda see the hair netting. But its not noticeable if its parted to the side, and even if its not, its only noticeable if you&#x27;re being scrutinized by someone or if you&#x27;re scrutinizing yourself. Anyways, this is an amazing quality wig for an incredibly low price, and there are quite a few gorgeous colors to choose from.</li>
            <li> The wig is very easy to maintain. It does tangle a little, but nothing severe. The hair color is exactly what I had expected. The wig fits perfectly thanks to the adjustable wig cap. Overall, this is an amazing product.</li>
            <li> This is very tangle-prone wig. and the bangs are...really unrealistic to style, but for my first wig purchase ever, it was great. I ended up not needing it, but will save it for future use. It&#x27;s very long!</li>
            <li> I bought this wig for my Leela costume and is perfect!  The quality is high for such a low price.  Probably not great for long term wear but is good quality for costumes. Bangs are cut nicely and the curls have lots of bounce.</li>
            <li> was hoping for a deeper purple color like the photo but its more bright purple. Its ok for a cheap wig, gets tangly fast.</li>
            <li> This wig is amazing. I wore it for a festival and I got so many compliments. People actually thought it was my real hair! :-) I would definitely recommend this to a friend</li>
            <li> Beautiful Wig in person. Plan ahead they do take a while to get to you...buts it&#x27;s well worth it. Good quality, built in hair net.</li>
            <li> I ordered this to take to my bachelorette party in Vegas! The wig fits great (the bangs kind of get in the way but it&#x27;s nothing a headband or a few bobby pins won&#x27;t fix). The curls are really nice and the long hair is fun! I can&#x27;t wait to wear it!</li>
            <li> Great wig.  Awesome fit, cut, and length.  And if you change your mind about the length it falls into a rocking bob, you could cut to get rid of extra length or pin back.</li>
            <li> The wig overall is very nice, however it  is a little thin so I recently purchased my second one in the same color, and the second one is much much much more vivid, which isnt going to help me since I need to sew them together to get more volume. I am slightly disapointed in that fact.</li>
            <li> So, this is probably going to be the longest review I&#x27;ve ever done. My Purple Coif Story. I had wanted a wig of color for a long time. I put a lot of thought into it. It took me a long time,... several weeks to nail down the color.  Green is my favorite color, kind of Martian looking.  Blue is pretty.  I wear a lot of black, and purple goes nice with black, so I decided on the dark purple. Such a nice Royal color or so I thought...  (Seen in the picture)&lt;br /&gt; So it arrived really fast, I was so excited.  I tore open the package, and the first thing I notice was the color.  Already, I&#x27;m thinking, well, I&#x27;ll give it darker purple roots with my sharpie, that will look cool!  I&#x27;ll make do.  I&#x27;m easy to please like that. I was disappointed but...  I&#x27;d figure it out. It wasn&#x27;t that expensive.  Then I get it out, and shake it. It&#x27;s so long and pretty. Super long. I&#x27;m 5&#x27;2&amp;#34; and it&#x27;s way down to my hips. That&#x27;s ok, I love them long.  So it&#x27;s a bit, disheveled, from being in the box, so I grab my wide toothed wig comb, and start at the bottom, working my way up... holding the wig against me. And huge chunks of hair begin to come out.  &amp;#34;well... it&#x27;s just from being manufactured, they always shed just a bit when they&#x27;re new, then they settle  down.&amp;#34;  Comb a bit more... More wads of hair.  I put her on my mannequin head and get my soft wig brush, and brush gently from bottom to top.  Hair, hair... huge clumps all over the floor.  I just cried.  So disappointed. Mostly because of the time I put into the purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, now by the time I&#x27;ve done all this, it&#x27;s not in any condition to even return. So I just throw it in the top of the guest room closet.  If you don&#x27;t mind massive shedding, and you&#x27;re not picky about the shade, it should be fine for you.</li>
            <li> Its soft like real hair, not as much curl as the pic, but exactly what i needed for my Leela costume Idea!</li>
            <li> So beautiful! The curls are perfect! Will order more!</li>
            <li> Came on time. Packaged grat. Comfortable. Decent product, but it will not hold up to regular wear over time. Also seems a bit thin. Great for occasional costume/ cosplay.</li>
            <li> Pretty wig after wearing a couple times just gets tangled on the ends still pretty though. I just trimmed the ends now it&#x27;s good agian</li>
            <li> It was good for what it was bought for a costume that was to be worn to multiple event; don&#x27;t expect to get only a couple of wears out of it before it becomes a matted mess.  Also, if your using this for a child&#x27;s costume, expect to have to cut (shape) it in the front as it&#x27;s definitely sized for an adult so the hair is extremely long in the front and can be bothersome to keep off the face.</li>
            <li> hair falls out of it.</li>
            <li> i like it and would recommend to my friends</li>
            <li> the hair is thick, curly, feels silky smooth and is the color shown. For the price, I was a little worried.... now I&#x27;m ordering more colors! You really can&#x27;t ask for more at this price</li>
            <li> For the price this wig is surprisingly thick, soft, and not really shiny like some lesser wigs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have A LOT of hair, and it almost all fit in the with a cap on! That is a feat!  I had to alter the style for my cosplay but the curls held nicely, and look great brushed out too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend!</li>
            <li> It looks NOTHING like it does in the picture.  I paid extra money to have it delivered on time and was highly upset.  It was all knotted up, and had no curl to it at all.  I had to use horse hair conditioner to get a comb through it.  I blew dry it, and curled it myself and it looked okay.  It doesn&#x27;t stay on well at all.  It came with a temporary tattoo, and a hair net which was neat.&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this...too much work to put into for what $10 will get you at a costume shop.</li>
            <li> Get&#x27;s tangled easily and I really had to push the bangs around to make them look normal and had to trim them so they didn&#x27;t hang in front of my eyes. But the tangling is to be expected with such a long wig. Otherwise, it looked really cute and I got several compliments. I wore this as part of a princess costume  and enjoy having purple hair for a day! To me, it doesn&#x27;t look natural but I&#x27;m also not a wig expert so I don&#x27;t know what a good quality wig should look like. It fit my need as a costume and I&#x27;m glad I purchased it. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll try to incorporate it into another costume in the future!</li>
            <li> I bought it in dark purple. It&#x27;s a great wig for a costume, not so much if you wanted to wear it out and what not, but then again, colored wigs are always risky for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it, nice and long. Kinda thin, but it&#x27;s nothing that terrible. Very vibrant purple. Not sure how it is with heat but with the way it looks I&#x27;m kinda too scared to try. All and all, easy 4 stars. Would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Gorgeous color and the quality is great. The hair is soft unlike most colored wigs. Highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> The wig is ok for the price, but if it&#x27;s not parted perfectly, you can totally see the netting underneath the hair.</li>
            <li> (via my girlfriend who I bought it for) For the price the quality is good. But it needed styling done to it.</li>
            <li> I bought this wig for a convention and it was amazing! It fit the character&#x27;s hair color and the style!</li>
            <li> After a single use the entire inside of the wig is a tangled matted mess!  The other big problem is that it is very thin. You really can&#x27;t do much with trimming the bangs without the underlying net popping out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would really recommend avoiding this wig unless you only plan on using it once.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for, so I am happy. The wig is wiggy-like so don&#x27;t think this wig will look like your real hair. The wig cap is white (why white and not black or tan? weird) so make sure you cover the edges of the wig. It does look like the picture for the most part. Great for cosplaying and that is exactly what it will be used for, so we are really happy. Oh and the best part, this shipped this so freaking fast!!!! I ordered on a Friday, they shipped in on Saturday, and it was here by the next Saturday (so in 7 days from China to NV,US via China Post---&amp;#62;USPS). Amazingly fast! Thanks!</li>
            <li> this is a lovely wig, but is only 32&amp;#34; if you stretch the curl out straight. The curls arrived a little messy, and in the generic flat plastic bag with little packaging to keep it safe on its long journey to the USA. The wefts and wig cap were as expected for this price, the basic non-stretchy mesh all over with small circle of center skin top. It was much shorter than I expected from the photo and description. Also, on my screen it appears to be a dark violet. The wig I received (after a VERY long shipping wait) was a very BRIGHT medium purple - much closer to a &amp;#34;neon&amp;#34; purple than the deep dark violet of... well, actual violets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t even want to try returning it to China, or worry about my money back since it&#x27;s so inexpensive... so I tossed it to my teen daughter and it looks terrific on her!</li>
