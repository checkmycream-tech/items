            <li> I was really disappointed in the product. I have purchased this product in stores for a few years and it was my favorite. This lotion I received appeared old and separated. It didn&#x27;t smell as nice either.</li>
            <li> I received the lotion instead of the body cream as pictured.  Fragrance however is true but was expecting the cream.  Did not bother with return, not worth the hassle.</li>
            <li> I will always recommend this product. However, I am disappointed that this order is taking so long. I don&#x27;t know why they wouldn&#x27;t just drop the item at my door, like it has been done in the past.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed. I&#x27;ve used the B &amp; B Night Blooming Body Lotion for years, but since I cannot find it any longer, I&#x27;m trying the cream. It is not as silky and does not have the depth of fragrance as the lotion.  So sad.</li>
            <li> Simply amazing. I wish bath and body works still sold it. It&#x27;s a light floral smell. Lasts all day too!</li>
            <li> My favorite floral scent! I love wearing this scented lotion because the scent lasts long and it is perfect moisturizer for my skin at the same time.</li>
            <li> JUST LIKE THE SHOWER GEL, THIS IS A GREAT LOTION, STAYS WITH YOU ALL DAY, VERY LIGHT VERY CLEAN.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;R</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite scent for years. It&#x27;s the only one I wear because it&#x27;s clean and light. I recently discovered that they&#x27;ve truly discontinued this fragrance and no longer sell it from their official website (I&#x27;ve been told for about 10 years now that this scent was being discontinued, now it&#x27;s finally happened...). Get this stuff, while supplies last!</li>
            <li> The lotion fragrance is very slight. I expected it to be more fragrant considering the cost. It is not a good value. As a lotion it is adequate but not special. I would not purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I like the fragrance, not too strong, but it&#x27;s a little thick. It goes on thick, but dries quickly.  Not greasy.</li>
            <li> This is a most beautiful intoxicating smell that captivates you the moment you smell it.  The cream goes on smoothly and the fragrance is simply lovely.  B&amp;BW has revived this line on their online store (Aug 2011) and that is just great news.</li>
            <li> I really like this body cream, first because the frangrance is marvelous and the consistency is very smooth and your skin stays soft for a considerable amount of time.</li>
            <li> Love it.  When I wear this it&#x27;s like sleeping in a garden full of jasmine flowers. It&#x27;s not overpowering</li>
            <li> the smell was not really the smell of Jasmin. I did not like it and it had a bad smell combined in it</li>
            <li> I really like the smell of this lotion.

I am disappointed in the way the Sweet Pea smells. Anyway, I also wear Clean Fresh Laundry lotion, which contains Night Blooming Jasmine...I love the fragrance. Hope this review helps anyone who may want to purchase this lotion.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this before and love the fragrance and it is smooth going on and softens skin. I&#x27;ll order it again!</li>
            <li> This is one of my wife&#x27;s favorite fragrances in body lotions and does keep it on hand.  It&#x27;s a pretty fragrance and lasts quite a while.</li>
