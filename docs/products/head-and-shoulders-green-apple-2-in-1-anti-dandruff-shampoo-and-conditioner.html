            <li>Love the fresh green-apple fragrance!</li>
            <li>Okay product, but not as good as clear.</li>
            <li>The conditioner works well and makes my hair silky and easy to manage.</li>
            <li>this is the first time I have used this as my own shampoo-</li>
            <li>Let my hair feeling clean and light  got to order again love it</li>
            <li>Head and Shoulders is always available in my home.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Additionally, unlike some other shampoos, Head &amp; Shoulders shampoos+conditioners provide a coating of dimethicone (a silicone) to your hair which gives great sheen and a very smooth feel while protecting it.</li>
            <li>This Shampoo+Conditioner smells great, of course as with many other Head &amp; Shoulders products.</li>
            <li>She loves the jolly rancher smell, and how shiny and full of body her hair is after using this.</li>
            <li>but this particular fragrance is my favorite.</li>
            <li>also the price is right and it washes my hair clean.</li>
            <li>My new favorite 2 in 1 shampoo.</li>
            <li>Great shampoo as all Head &amp; Shoulders typically is.  </li>
            <li>Not only is this a great odor, but also the green apple scent is one that I love now!  </li>
            <li>This left my hair feeling kind of sticky.</li>
            <li>A decent product commercial wise.</li>
            <li>Hair feels clean, fresh, soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>You can feel the difference after the first use of this.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>My head tends to get very itchy periodically.</li>
            <li>I love green apples so much I bought a bag on amazon fresh and</li>
            <li>Head &amp; Shoulders make amazing hair products and Green Apple is one of such products.</li>
            <li>I have used Head &amp; Shoulders products for years for a mild dry scalp condition.</li>
            <li>First of all, I do not use this shampoo for dandruff because I don&#x27;t have any, but I did use it while staying at a relative&#x27;s home for two weeks.</li>
            <li>Maybe this new formula works to get rid of dandruff for those who suffer from dandruff, but it gave me dandruff instead, and my hair wasn&#x27;t as bouncy as it was when I was on the old formula.</li>
            <li>This also smells great, not some &#x27;artificial smelling&#x27; odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Mt dermatologist recommended it for my 17 year old son.</li>
            <li>If you have dry scalp it really helps keeping it moisturized.</li>
            <li>When I asked my relative about his Head and Shoulder&#x27;s at his house, he said it was so old.</li>
            <li>I really like the fact that this is gentle enough for everyday use, even for color or chemically treated hair.</li>
            <li>It leaves a lingering fresh green apple scent.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried their Green Apple scent</li>

            <li> I switched back to my normal shampoo and no more dandruff.</li>
            <li> All their products work well for dry flaking scalp and this is no exception.  </li>
            <li> works as expected.  </li>
            <li> After a few days the dandruff will come back and you need to wash your head again.</li>

            <li> felt just like any other 2-in-1</li>
            <li> But after using it, my fingers got cracky due to the chemicals in it.</li>
            <li> Switch to some simple ones from WholeFood, and no more cracky hands.</li>
            <li> Works just as well as any other H&amp;S for preventing dandruff.</li>
            <li> It eliminates her dandruff and other scalp issues.</li>
            <li> I use head and shoulders not only to keep the flakes and dry scalp away but also because I was noticing a weird scent coming from my head during the day.  </li>
            <li> Hubby loves it and wouldn&#x27;t use any other shampoo!!</li>
            <li> But then, you need to wash your head every few days anyway.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, other reviewers have stated that this shampoo has been reformulated.</li>
            <li> He only uses Head &amp; Shoulders and I hate some of the smells of the others</li>
            <li> and I was afraid it would leave my hair dull and drab AND smell bad too.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s impossible to salvage any of it.</li>

            <li> great shampoo,great price ,what else can you ask for.</li>
            <li> smells good but did not see a difference in the flake department...felt just like any other 2-in-1</li>
            <li> it has done the job well</li>
            <li> I have been buying this for decades, now they say it causes hairloss? bullocks!</li>
            <li> A decent product commercial wise. But after using it, my fingers got cracky due to the chemicals in it. Switch to some simple ones from WholeFood, and no more cracky hands.</li>
            <li> Smells good and husbands loves it.  He only uses Head &amp; Shoulders and I hate some of the smells of the others so this is perfect.</li>
            <li> Only type of shampoo my father uses! he loves it.</li>
            <li> Okay product, but not as good as clear. Smell nice though.</li>
            <li> After going between shampoos, eventually we&#x27;ll revert to Head &amp; Shoulders.&lt;br /&gt;The 2in1 simplifies the entire process of conditioning. This also smells great, not some &#x27;artificial smelling&#x27; odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously, this is intended to help with dandruff, and it does it well. Expect results gradually though (1wk+).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, unlike some other shampoos, Head &amp; Shoulders shampoos+conditioners provide a coating of dimethicone (a silicone) to your hair which gives great sheen and a very smooth feel while protecting it. You can feel the difference after the first use of this.</li>
            <li> I have used Head &amp; Shoulders products for years for a mild dry scalp condition. All their products work well for dry flaking scalp and this is no exception.  This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried their Green Apple scent and I really like it. It isn&#x27;t overpowering but it does last a while. The conditioner works well and makes my hair silky and easy to manage. My new favorite 2 in 1 shampoo.</li>
            <li> We always use Head &amp; Shoulders.  It is great!</li>
            <li> Family loves the shampoo</li>
            <li> works as expected.  great product.</li>
            <li> This is great and has a great smell.  I use head and shoulders not only to keep the flakes and dry scalp away but also because I was noticing a weird scent coming from my head during the day.  One use of head and shoulders and never noticed it again.  I have used generic of the &amp;#34;same&amp;#34; product and it didn&#x27;t perform as well.  I will conitnue to use head and shoulders and ONLY Head &amp; Shoulders for YEARS to come!</li>
            <li> What can I say about this? Works as intended.</li>
            <li> like it like the smell</li>
            <li> Great smelling and effective shampoo/conditioner.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> works well..plaesant  smell.</li>
            <li> Works just as well as any other H&amp;S for preventing dandruff. However, I think the green apple smell is too strong and too artificial.</li>
            <li> This shampoo both helps with dandruff and smells great. I always get compliments when I use it on how good my hair smells.</li>
            <li> My head tends to get very itchy periodically. I&#x27;ve found this is the only brand of shampoo that reliably stops that problem.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo... this is the first time I have used this as my own shampoo- and I was afraid it would leave my hair dull and drab AND smell bad too.  Not only is this a great odor, but also the green apple scent is one that I love now!  I will be a regular customer!</li>
            <li> It actually works against dandruff!</li>
            <li> great product at a great price. Mt dermatologist recommended it for my 17 year old son. Even my vet recommended it for my dogs. Love it !!!</li>
            <li> Head &amp; Shoulders make amazing hair products and Green Apple is one of such products. This Shampoo+Conditioner smells great, of course as with many other Head &amp; Shoulders products. Hair feels clean, fresh, soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I loved the way this smelled and it worked very well. great product at a great price. I would definately reccomend this product.</li>
            <li> We have been using Head and Shoulders for years with no complaints. The product does what it says it will do and the scent is great! The Subscribe and Save option not only makes it easier to get this item when I need it, but it keeps the price lower than purchasing in store.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed the smell of the head and shoulders shampoo also the price is right and it washes my hair clean.</li>
            <li> First of all, I do not use this shampoo for dandruff because I don&#x27;t have any, but I did use it while staying at a relative&#x27;s home for two weeks. It made my hair gorgeous, and my scalp felt and smelled clean for days. When I came home, I thought I would purchase it again. I came across this apple scented version on Amazon and ordered it. I have used it 4 times and I started getting dandruff which I have never had before. This gave me dandruff! This is supposed to be an anti dandruff shampoo!. I switched back to my normal shampoo and no more dandruff. When I asked my relative about his Head and Shoulder&#x27;s at his house, he said it was so old. Needless to say, other reviewers have stated that this shampoo has been reformulated. Perhaps I used the original formula before and was pleased. Maybe this new formula works to get rid of dandruff for those who suffer from dandruff, but it gave me dandruff instead, and my hair wasn&#x27;t as bouncy as it was when I was on the old formula. This left my hair feeling kind of sticky.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo as all Head &amp; Shoulders typically is.  I have been using this brand for years and will continue to use them.</li>
            <li> I like it but said two pack and I Received  just one bottle.</li>
            <li> The Head &amp; Shoulders has stopped my scalp from itching.</li>
            <li> Works wonders for my hair.</li>
            <li> Good Product and good seller, recommended</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great and works well!</li>
            <li> The shampoo itself may be excellent however, I can&#x27;t tell you because BOTH bottles were opened in the package. It&#x27;s impossible to salvage any of it. It makes a nice air freshener for my trash but that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> I get this for my teenage daughter. She loves the jolly rancher smell, and how shiny and full of body her hair is after using this. It eliminates her dandruff and other scalp issues.</li>
            <li> Hubby loves it and wouldn&#x27;t use any other shampoo!!</li>
            <li> Family loves product good price, works well.</li>
            <li> Smell is good and price is good as well.</li>
            <li> So happy I can buy this product on Amazon via subscription.  Makes shopping much more easier.  The product works well to help get rid of dandruff and smells good as well.</li>
            <li> wonderful smells amazing and makes ur head feel awesome will deff be purchasing other scents and its an amazing deal to get to bc at my local store 1 bottle of shampoo is the same price as ur getting 2 on here</li>
            <li> Pay attention to the oz to judge the size.</li>
            <li> Love the fresh green-apple fragrance! Head and Shoulders is always available in my home. All of us use it but this particular fragrance is my favorite. It leaves a lingering fresh green apple scent. I really like the fact that this is gentle enough for everyday use, even for color or chemically treated hair.</li>
            <li> I really like the Head and Shoulders 2 in 1 in green apple. The scent is wonderful and no need to apply a second conditioner. If you have dry scalp it really helps keeping it moisturized.</li>
            <li> I love green apples so much I bought a bag on amazon fresh and this to go with it.</li>
            <li> Good, been using for years, good to find deals here</li>
            <li> Love the smell. Works great too! Head n shoulders is the best dandruff product.</li>
            <li> Let my hair feeling clean and light  got to order again love it</li>
            <li> GOOD PRODUCT. PACKAGE WELL PACKED!</li>
            <li> This shampoo sells at a great price, smells great and keeps my scalp dandruff free for a few days. Not that it does not rid you of dandruff and does not treat anything. After a few days the dandruff will come back and you need to wash your head again. But then, you need to wash your head every few days anyway. I have yet to find a replacement for Head and Shoulders. It is great. And I always get it on Amazon cheaper than in Brick and Mortar stores. Thank you Amazon!</li>
            <li> This is a life saver. My husband gets so upset when we run out of head and shoulders.</li>
