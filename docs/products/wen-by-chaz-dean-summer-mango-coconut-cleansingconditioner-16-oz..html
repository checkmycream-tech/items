            <li>I have fine, straight gray hair and it is just wonderful!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the original WEN and had good results with that.</li>
            <li>Despite the good products &amp; healthy diet, using Wen made a huge difference in how my hair looks and feels.  </li>
            <li>Love It, the best smelling one so far.</li>
            <li>It worked great the first time and now it seems as though the conditioner is building up in my hair.</li>
            <li>Even my hair color looks more like it did when I was younger, the shine is amazing and if feels wonderful.</li>
            <li>For all you gals that haven&#x27;t tried Wen yet, this is a great scent to try first.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Summary:  Worked great the first time, except the pump broke (hence the 4 stars instead of 5).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not getting a very smooth result.</li>
            <li>to use it is very important.</li>
            <li>That method was great and super cheap, but it did leave a waxy build-up on my hair over time.</li>
            <li>These scent is ok</li>
            <li>Such a wonderful company to work with.  </li>
            <li>I love anything WEN.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this mango coconut cleansing conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>favorite one out of all the wens.</li>
            <li>this one i feel is more moisturizing :)</li>
            <li>We love wen just wish they made a shampoo.</li>
            <li>Healthy hair has many effects on your every day life</li>

            <li>This is my favorite WEN fragrances.</li>

            <li>I dont&#x27; mind spending more for this product</li>
            <li>I use it as more of a once a week conditioning treatment because of the price -</li>
            <li>but more like spring break</li>
            <li>I love the way that Wen feels in my hair.</li>
            <li>Which is okay.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using WEN for years, and I love the price.  </li>

            <li>Ok, one word.....</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>I love the WEN hair products....</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>has a wonderful smell but it leaves my hair feeling greasy after a day which with my regular shampoo and conditoner does not</li>
            <li>love how my hair feels</li>
            <li>That is over the top.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I love the feel of my hair</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>It was better to buy here without having to be automatically shipped.</li>
            <li>I use it as a conditioner and love the results.</li>
            <li>&amp; I have found that it works better for me if I dilute it.</li>
            <li>The deal on there is actually better for 2 bottles.</li>
            <li>I love the smell...</li>
            <li>Head and shoulders works leaps and bounds better.</li>
            <li>I love Wen Cleansing conditioners.  </li>
            <li>Love the Wen system.  </li>
            <li>Love the summer smell</li>
            <li>Okay, so I&#x27;m still using this one bottle of WEN after over a month.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how it compares, but I love it.  </li>
            <li>Love it..</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>LOVE this product.......</li>
            <li>My favorite smelling Wen to date.</li>
            <li>I love the way it makes my hair feel</li>
            <li>The smell is the best next to the pomegranate.  </li>
            <li>I love the product.  </li>
            <li>I love coconut mango anything, and this was just what the doctor ordered.</li>
            <li>glad I did.</li>
            <li>I just bought the winter vanilla mint to try and love that too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s tingly like the 6-13 but smells way better.</li>
            <li>not Fig because I love more tropical</li>
            <li>Umm-m-m, love the fragrance of this product and how my hair stops frizzing out after shampooing.</li>
            <li>all the time not just seasonal! :)</li>
            <li>This conditioner makes my hair silky smooth!</li>
            <li>Next we received a collection letter from the wonderful people over at Wen.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure at some point the Better Business Bureau will get to the bottom of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this summer smell of coconut and mango.</li>
            <li>I love Wen as a conditioner, but it honestly doesn&#x27;t get my hair clean if I try to use it as a cleanser, even if I wash twice.</li>
            <li>I have tried several of the Wen cleansers (almond mint, pom, cucumber and pumpkin), but Mango Coconut is my favorite!!!</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t order it in the first place!!!</li>
            <li>My wife was very excited when she ordered this product</li>
            <li>one step to beautiful, soft hair!  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s natural beautiful curl that I get so many complements on.</li>
            <li>tangly-breakage - but not so far this year, thank you!!!!!!!  </li>
            <li>I loved this product when I first got it.</li>
            <li>but I paid good money for a product that I won&#x27;t use again after the first couple times.</li>
            <li>It makes it soft, healthier, and smelling beautiful.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;I have always loved Wen because the moisturizing in it helped me to grow my hair to midback length for the first time in my life.  </li>
            <li>Wen leaves my hair full and easy to manage and I LOVE this smell!</li>
            <li>I find that it works best on color treated and dry hair.</li>
            <li>It smells great and works nice as a leave-in conditioner, but it didn&#x27;t make my hair extra shiny or manageable.</li>
            <li>I loved the smell but it only worked good on my hair for about a month.  </li>
            <li>WEN Cleansing Conditioner does a great job on my hair leaving it very soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>This scent was new for me, but very nice.  </li>
            <li>I have written many reviews on WEN, and nothing has changed; This is a fantastic cleansing conditioner.</li>
            <li>My hair looks great and is so soft without any frizz.</li>
            <li>this product is becoming too pricey for the performance</li>
            <li>We love the silky smooth manageable feeling we get from wen.</li>
            <li>more then the Sweet Almond Mint and smells 20x&#x27;s better as well.</li>
            <li>I love the product and will enjoy using it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Leaves hair smelling great and soft.  </li>
            <li>This product is ok,  not as fantastic as the commercials lead you to believe.  </li>
            <li>it sure does make my hair look healthy and full.</li>
            <li>I think the WEN is great to use part time not everyday, it seemed to make my hair too oily, after prolonged use.  </li>
            <li>My hair smells great and is soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>This one smells really good, very summery.</li>
            <li>I have tried Wen before from a friend and loved it so much I wanted to order it myself.</li>
            <li>I decided to stay on until I spoke with a REAL PERSON (I recommend getting a good book to read while you wait.)</li>
            <li>I think its because of the coconut in it, my hair is at its best when I&#x27;m using this particular bottle, &amp;#34;Vanilla Mint&amp;#34; would have to be my second favorite!</li>
            <li>MORE THEN THE ORIGINAL FORMULA.FOR PEOPLE OF COLOR</li>
            <li>I feel that the original almond mint Wen smells and works better than this one...</li>
            <li>The smell is so yummy and sweet!</li>
            <li>It is the ONLY one that smells good!</li>
            <li>I returned it and Amazon was very quick with a refund.</li>
            <li>I had reservations for sure and did not want to believe a conditioner could actually clean my hair</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t feel my hair was clean or more shiny</li>
            <li>I love WEN, but this one didnt really clean my hair.</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would strongly recommend that EVERYONE give this product a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product works wonders and I HIGHLY recommend it to anyone looking for a good change.</li>
            <li>I love this product, however for me I have to use shampoo to wash my hair (specially after a work out)</li>
            <li>So soft and smells amazing!</li>
            <li>Ok, so now that I&#x27;ve tried the Sweet Almond Mint and the Tea Tree, I just had to try the Summer Mango Coconut</li>
            <li>I am a true Wen girl. :)</li>
            <li>also use the Intensive Moist Hair Treatment Sweet Almond in conjunction with the Mango Coconut Cleansing/Conditioner with every \\&quot;shampoo\\&quot; and I love the results.  </li>
            <li>so I seen the Summer Mango and thought it would smell sexy and it does it smells so tropical and sweet</li>
            <li>I looked down and saw a section of hair form into a perfect ringlet.  </li>
            <li>This scent is delicious and keeps smelling great, even if I go an extra day between cleansings (unlike one or two of the other scents).  </li>
            <li>Fine, but lots of hair, and it is somewhere between wavy and curly, prone to frizz.</li>
            <li>I have fine, color treated hair.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair that is highlighted.</li>
            <li>The product itself is fine, but the pump does not work at all.</li>
            <li>I bought this product several weeks ago and was very impressed at first-</li>
            <li>My winter Cranberry Mint arrived quickly and my hair has been fabulous ever since!</li>
            <li>my hair smelled great and felt super soft-</li>
            <li>I have noticed more fly-aways around my part, but that may just be new hair growth since my scalp is more healthy.  </li>
            <li>I have fine light colored hair.  </li>
            <li>Since I started using WEN, my hair is healthy, shiny, manageable and plain amazing!!</li>
            <li>I love the Wen cleansing conditioner so much that I returned to QVC to purchase products for my mom, sister and three friends for upcoming birthdays!!</li>
            <li>checked the label what a HUGE difference with not using now</li>
            <li>Received item as described, fast delivery, nice packaging.</li>
            <li>I get different scents and have been happy.</li>
            <li>This is a great product - if used properly.</li>
            <li>Go tresemee fantastic product.</li>
            <li>I personally like to have great smelling hair and the Summer Mango</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s seasonal and not always available.  </li>
            <li>I have used a few of the Wen flavors and I have to say that this one is the best!</li>
            <li>I knew I was getting genuine product.  </li>
            <li>is fantastic.</li>
            <li>My hair is fantastic using the WEN cleansing conditioners.  </li>
            <li>this is one product that smells great, and is just the slippery creamy sulfate free conditioner that is great for all hair types ESPECIALLY African American kinks, curls and coils!</li>
            <li>This Cleansing Conditioner is great and the commercial on TV is correct.</li>
            <li>But this cleansing conditioner is fabulous.  </li>
            <li>Wish it was always available.</li>
            <li>Coconut is such a great smell for summer</li>
            <li>I will continue to buy Wen from Amazon because I feel comfortable in knowing I control my purchases.</li>
            <li>Mango really smells nice.</li>
            <li>this is by far the best conditioner ever left my hair shiny and soft and I have corse curly hair so happy with this product</li>
            <li>It keeps my daughters hair shiny and knot free.  </li>
            <li>When I use Wen, it&#x27;s so smooth - but still wavy.</li>
            <li>It feels really smooth and silky even while lathering your hair.  </li>
            <li>I will probably try to fall and winter scents when they become available.</li>
            <li>I have used Pantene 2 in 1 shampoo and conditioner for smooth hair and then the Pantene smooth conditioner for years.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe it, because I read some reviews that said it causes hair loss, but I&#x27;ve experienced the opposite.  </li>
            <li>It just doesn&#x27;t quite smooth and detangle as well.  </li>
            <li>Coconut is light, with a hint of mango, and it&#x27;s kinda vanillawee too.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li>MAke PUmpkin available and this available</li>
            <li>So far,  so good.</li>
            <li>L&#x27;Oreal sulfate free body conditioner does NOT contain MCI and MI; and I must admit my hair actually smelled better, felt better and looked better as well:)  </li>
            <li>Smells so good and leaves my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>but the sound of this special summer scent appealed to us.</li>
            <li>WEN is such an amazing product!</li>
            <li>NOT IF MY WONDERFUL AMAZON HAS IT, ONE OF THE FEW WEN PRODUCTS THAT ACTUALLY SMELLS GOOD</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t familiar with.</li>
            <li>this a try, it&#x27;s worth the money!</li>
            <li>I am not disappointed.</li>
            <li>However, I didn&#x27;t like the auto order and pay you have to sign up for with original Wen.</li>
            <li>: Make sure you really rinse the product out well!</li>
            <li>know tons of people love this product, but who can spend that much money for hair cleanser?!</li>
            <li>I am an avid Wen user and love it.  </li>
            <li>That being said, when I received my bottle of WEN, I was excited to use it &amp; see how it holds up to the claims on the infomercial.</li>
            <li>I am going to try the Original formula...</li>
            <li>and my hair is always shiny and clean.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair &amp; scalp feel sqeaky clean.</li>
            <li>My hair feels healthier, its shinier, it stay clean longer</li>
            <li>But Wen makes it both clean and conditioned.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel clean when I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li>I was kind of worried about paying this much for a hair care product, but it was worth it.  </li>
            <li>it makes my hair super silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>This really is a great Cleansing Conditioner for my daughter that has dry wavy hair.  </li>
            <li>In addition, it helped maintain the color longer than when I used shampoo and condition to clean my hair.  </li>
            <li>and I would have to wash it twice with Wen to get it clean</li>
            <li>If you have to have suds to feel your hair is clean, this is not for you, but I guarantee you, it does clean your hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair felt clean and not waxy.</li>
            <li>Second time I order Wen by Caz Dean cleansing conditioner I&#x27;m very happy with it, and I love the price and such quick service.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Wen for years and Mango Coconut is by far my favorite!</li>
            <li>Makes my hair so soft &amp; healthy!</li>
            <li>but this scent has so far been my favorite!  </li>
            <li>I started using WEN and within the week my hair felt so soft and looked fantastic!!</li>
            <li>Wen is nothing special, nothing to write home about.</li>
            <li>the mango coconut has a great smell and it lasts all day long!!!</li>
            <li>Have enjoyed it so much.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as fuzzy, and the bottom of my hair is much fuller and not straggly any more.</li>
            <li>Really get in there and make sure the product is in at the scalp level.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t take it any more and went back to my sulfate free botanical shampoo and my hair and scalp feel so much better.</li>
            <li>But, I really like the Renpure better.</li>
            <li>everyone wants to know how I keep it so healthy.</li>
            <li>it simply sounds like it will smell so good.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair soft, but it smells like some kind of dog shampoo or flea bath...</li>
            <li>Too sweet.</li>
            <li>It feels so much healthier and is much more manageable...</li>
            <li>Your hair will smell of exotic places and sexy suntanned bodies, whew, better take a sec to compose myself...........</li>
            <li>With this magic potion, I can wear my hair straight or curly.</li>
            <li>if I did 10 full pumps</li>
            <li>but one full pump size is about the size of a quarter.</li>
            <li>Does smell good especially for t he summer</li>
            <li>Most surprising of all I am losing 2/3 less hair than I was.</li>
            <li>I have not used other products, but the shampoo is great.</li>
            <li>Wish they would give you a minimum time you should keep it on before rinsing as I take really quick showers.  </li>
            <li>Delivered quickly.</li>
            <li>Still smells good, but it gets old fast.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this, and my hair simply behaves better.</li>
            <li>i have hair that gets oily fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li>- have tried many different products for tangles and many DO NOT work-</li>
            <li>I think the people that experienced hair loss, we&#x27;re just not use to combing out their hair in the shower, and seeing how much they were actually losing all along.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line: it is a good overall product that is worth the money</li>
            <li>If you have very long hair and decide to do 36 full pumps good luck getting it into your hand(s).</li>
            <li>The pump didn&#x27;t fit the bottle and it smells nothing like the first bottle I had ordered from Wen.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27; wondering if this is for real or is this a pitch for the consumer to use a lot at a time thus increasing the need to buy more more frequently.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much!</li>
            <li>I tried my new WEN product and am less than impressed.  </li>
            <li>but it needs the conditioner to be the carrier for the shampoo which is why you have to use so much of the cream, or even wash it twice to get clean, grease free hair.</li>
            <li>let me find my swimsuit:)  Love the smell and will be conditioning (leaving it in for a long time)</li>
            <li>And apply just a tiny amount of jojoba oil on my hair after blowdrying, makes my hair shiny and freezy free!!</li>
            <li>Using this for the first time, I thought that the cream seemed really rich and</li>
            <li>There is no &amp;#34;sudsing action&amp;#34;, and you may feel like your hair isn&#x27;t really clean at first.</li>
            <li>Hard to get use to no suds, but it certainly makes your hair feel great!!</li>
            <li>As far as I know, she likes it very much!!!</li>
            <li>Makes a HUGE difference for my whole family.</li>
            <li>Wen is AMAZING of your trying to bring strength back to your hair.!</li>
            <li>The Summer Mango Coconut is by far my favorite scent.</li>
            <li>I guess I wasn&#x27;t thrilled with the outcome of the product because I don&#x27;t use it enough to see if it works over time.  </li>
            <li>My scalp broke out and my hair does not smell fresh with this product.  </li>
            <li>i love how soft my hair gets using wen</li>
            <li>It has never felt so soft or looked so healthy........</li>
            <li>let it soak in, spend an hour on the whole process, and, in doing it only once a week, not end up hating Chaz Dean for a good portion of every shower they take.</li>
            <li>like Sun and Surf and fun....</li>
            <li>My favorite wen cleanser of all time so far.</li>
            <li>Lightweight and fresh scent</li>
            <li>Shipping procedure was poor at best.  </li>
            <li>but I thought that this would be a fun change for our trip.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried almost all of them and this is my favorite by far.</li>
            <li>this is  the one worth every penney</li>
            <li>We love Wen products (my 17 year old daughter and I)</li>
            <li>cuz I&#x27;m worth it</li>
            <li>,  it  is  worth  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had several people at work comment on how nice my looks since using this product.  </li>
            <li>The others are eh, but this one is fresh and stays fresh.  </li>
            <li>Love the adult formula too.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t really want to try anything else because I love this so much.</li>
            <li>( I rarely use hair products)</li>
            <li>Made my daughter&#x27;s curly hair so soft and tangle free!</li>
            <li>so I honestly I didn&#x27;t try it until now because my Aunt has a very big bottle of the Fig Wen and she told me that she likes it</li>
            <li>I have a very full head of very fine hairs--which are very prone to frizz, especially in humid weather.</li>
            <li>The other two are good as well, but this is my favorite so far.</li>
            <li>Color last and looks sooo rich !!</li>
            <li>So I went to the Wen site and ordered the Summer Mango Coconut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It arrived quickly, but after first washing (I followed the directions to a tee)</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for fine and colored hair.  </li>
            <li>After using this item for over a month, she told me that her hair has not changed much other than I believe it smells good.</li>
            <li>I really like WEN, but I think I&#x27;ll stick with the original sents.</li>
            <li>Great to use here and there but hard to use full time.</li>
            <li>THIS WEN PRODUCT HAS JUST THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF MOISTURIZING AND</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t even try to comb it right when you just scrubbed it</li>
            <li>THIS PRODUCT WORKS BEST WHEN PUTTING IT ON YOUR HAIR DRY WITH ONLY 5 PUMPS FOR YOUR WHOLE HEAD.THEN LEAVING IT</li>
            <li>The WEN I first bought was the lavender, but the Mango Coconut is by far better for my hair.</li>
            <li>The deep conditioner they send with the shampoo is wonderful, leaves your hair very soft, but the actual shampoo is not working for me.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling soft and clean!</li>
            <li>until I noticed very large clumps of my hair falling out with continued use.</li>
            <li>Ordering was easy &amp; service was better then expected.</li>
            <li>I felt it didnt feel the same as my usual Wen, but once I \\&quot;lathered\\&quot; up and rinsed out, I loved how cleanly it rinsed out..and very easily</li>
            <li>Seems pricey at first, but lasts a while and worth it.</li>
            <li>This was a summer WEN scent and formula that I found to be not only long lasting, thick and creamy, but one of the best, if not the best, of all WEN formulas I have tried.  </li>
            <li>Works well on long hair, the scent is nice and not overpowering</li>
            <li>But people with thick hair will love it, I am sure!</li>
            <li>Really this is a great product, and my wife highly recommends this for anyone with dry damaged or brittle hair.</li>
            <li>Because my hair is so fine, I really don&#x27;t need as much product as the directions give.  </li>
            <li>, I have very fine fragile hair</li>
            <li>Super fast shipment.</li>
            <li>great product, been using for almost two years now - wouldn&#x27;t go back to traditional shampoo.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very, very dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think it would be good for the planet to reduce the number of these little bottles.</li>
            <li>The mango coconut scent is nice but a little too sweet smelling.  </li>
            <li>I do not believe it is worth as much as they charge for it.</li>
            <li>If anyone has direct questions, please feel free to ask me; I have been using WEN for 5 years.</li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for two years and my hair is completely healthy and back to</li>
            <li>I also really love the fig because my hair is colored and it makes the color shine and last longer.</li>
            <li>so I was interested in trying it.</li>
            <li>but I feel like I need to use more product than recommended to get any lasting results and for the price I can use another conditioner.</li>
            <li>I am a Wen user and have been ever since I first tried a sample packet.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Wen for several months now and will never go back to shampoo, not even the phosphate free kind.  </li>
            <li>Start massaging the product into your scalp first.  </li>
            <li>After the first wash I lost triple the amount of hair</li>
            <li>i used the product three times to make sure i used it properly.  </li>
            <li>Thinning on the top and patches thru out the hair, everyone is reporting the same thing.</li>
            <li>THAT YOU( FIRST) GO THROUGH YOU HAIR WITH YOUR FINGERS AND USE THE COMB,THEN AFTER ALL THIS BLOWDRY</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t make your hair feel any cleaner, just feels like you just skipped the shampoo and went straight to the conditioner!</li>
            <li>This scent is my favorite, only problem</li>
            <li>This works even better than the Almond Mint I have used prior.</li>
            <li>Very summer!  </li>
            <li>I had seen the 30 minute commercial playing at the gym many times.</li>
            <li>I could get my money back, I would, but I am sure</li>
            <li>On my 2nd bottle of this one and will buy more.</li>
            <li>DOnt love it enough to replace those.</li>
            <li>Now, as I&#x27;ve read most of these posts, these women actually expect immediate results as said in the infomercial.</li>
            <li>the first while</li>
            <li>I found the directions call for more use of product than is necessary.  </li>
            <li>Four pumps is enough for my  hair, but others might need more.  </li>
            <li>I really like Wen cleansers - even though they are rather pricey!</li>
            <li>Love the different flavors and the product.  </li>
            <li>I still supplement occasionally with a favorite shampoo too.</li>
            <li>I have tried WEN many time always to go back to shampoo after a while.  </li>
            <li>I find the condition of my hair to actually look better.  </li>
            <li>While many rave about the Winter Vanilla Mint - I like to think of summer in the middle of winter.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell of anything fruity or this purchase was a big plus.</li>
            <li>Order arrived fast!</li>
            <li>It is smooth, soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>Ok I&#x27;m a guy with short hair</li>
            <li>It lasts longer and it actually works better for me this way.</li>
            <li>First off</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been playing around with how many pumps works for me and everyone will probably be different.  </li>
            <li>So my next purchase will be with QVC just to be safe.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft, silky, smooth, and it moves around a lot.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve just ordered more in a different flavor.  </li>
            <li>This was my first time purchasing Wen from Amazon.</li>
            <li>Love the scent - will miss it until next summer!</li>
            <li>First I wanna say that I&#x27;ve seen the commercials on Wen a lot</li>
            <li>It doesnt lather like most shampoos and such, but it works.</li>
            <li>A few had and LOVED it</li>
            <li>I am fairly new to WEN cleansing conditioner, I have bought this conditoner and the Sweet Almond Mint one, designed for all hair types but no comparison for me the Summer Mango definetley hydrated my hair 20x&#x27;s</li>
            <li>Really good!&lt;br /&gt;Finally someone at Wen took notice that all their products stink...and got it right</li>
            <li>have very fine hair and it tends towards the dry side at the ends.  </li>
            <li>It makes her hair feel clean and soft .</li>
            <li>Nice smell, but not worth the higher price.</li>
            <li>I love this fragrence and enjoy using it everyday.</li>
            <li>The Mango-Coconut formula is very hydrating, more so than the Pomegranate, about the same as the Fig.  </li>
            <li>This is a good product the smell wasn&#x27;t too harsh and left my hair smelling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>have used other wen  such as pumpkin spice with great results.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Thanks to Wen and Thanks to Amazon.com!</li>
            <li>I used the recommended amount at first and found it was too much-</li>
            <li>but it was great for all of us - soft and silky hair and not at all heavy or greasy, even if my kids didn&#x27;t get it completely rinsed out!!!  </li>
            <li>I am obsessed with how amazing my hair looks with the wen products!!</li>
            <li>I get much better results in assisting with my dry hair with this product</li>
            <li>After about 12 pumps, I saw large amounts of product on the shower floor.</li>
            <li>then I comb through it as directed with the large toothed comb.</li>
            <li>this purchase was a gift as you can&#x27;t get that scent after a certain period of time.</li>
            <li>Wen builds up on hair, takes forever to rinse out and is not suitable as a cleanser for anyone who spends a good amount of time outdoors or exercising.</li>
            <li>smells good and works really nice , but if you use as much as the say to use each time , it could get very expensive.</li>
            <li>This has definitely been my favorite Wen so far!  </li>
            <li>I found this one to be the slickest, and a little dab works nicely as a leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li>The coconut smell is faint once on, but in the shower it smells amazing :)</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s worth at least one bottle to try the cleansing conditioner as the results are amazing</li>
            <li>Fast shipment also.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much.</li>
            <li>Very costly though.  </li>
            <li>so i don&#x27;t have to  use as much as the product states</li>
            <li>A bottle for me lasts 5 months since i don&#x27;t need to wash my hair as much as i needed to before.</li>
            <li>Went through product to fast.</li>
            <li>Fast shipment</li>
            <li>I really thought this product would work for both a shampoo and conditioner (to save time and $$)</li>
            <li>This is not the real Wen shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I did give it to a co-worker who has medium-thick, straight hair, and she loves it.  </li>
            <li>and she really likes it.</li>
            <li>It has to be washed out really well</li>
            <li>but I really like it.  </li>
            <li>This formula, probably because of the coconut, is a very dense, moisturizing formula of Wen.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this for four days....not really noticing much difference.  </li>
            <li>A real bargain.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I got the real WEN or the knock-off version...</li>
            <li>IF YOU DON&#x27;T USE THIS PRODUCT THIS WAY OR SIMULAR TO THIS,IT BECOMES VERY TANGLED</li>
            <li>but I suspect that I wouldn&#x27;t have much shine.</li>
            <li>and it does seem to be quite gentle.  </li>
            <li>This product really works the way it was described on TV.</li>
            <li>I found this one and the mango coconut scent is really what caught my attention.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t buy it again and dont really recommend</li>
            <li>I really believe it is using Wen.</li>
            <li>I really despise the smell of this to the point that I just won&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li>I enjoy almost all the different fragrances and having been using Wen for over a decade.</li>
            <li>and it really gave my hair body, shine, and life.</li>
            <li>I really like the tropical Mango Coconut</li>
            <li>products are very pricey</li>
            <li>I think this might actually be my absolute wen fragrance/formula.</li>
            <li>I am using S Factor which is much easier, cheaper, and</li>
            <li>What I really like about WEN is no matter how much I need to get those tangles out of my daughter&#x27;s hair - it doesn&#x27;t make her hair greasy.  </li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t really like the smell too much.</li>
            <li>Every ten days I lightly use a shampoo to do a thorough cleansing</li>
            <li>So I don&#x27;t think I will not spend this much money again....</li>
            <li>However, I noticed that it really is a CLEANSING conditioner as I rinsed the product.</li>
            <li>I am really tempted to try the Sally&#x27;s version which is much cheaper</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>but I think they want you to use so much</li>
            <li>It is very tangly, so</li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>Also, i didn&#x27;t need to use as much of the product as recommended.</li>
            <li>Smell great but no great results with conditioning.</li>
            <li>I really like the product, just wish the bottle was the size it used to come in.</li>
            <li>I have been using Wen for 2 years and really like it.  </li>
            <li>I have curly hair and this really detangles.  </li>
            <li>love how this makes my hair feel healthier and soft without the extra weight.....</li>
            <li>My hair is now soft and shiny!!!</li>
            <li>As someone approaching retirement and due to have to manage a fixed income, I won&#x27;t be able to afford this product that I love.  </li>
            <li>this product is somewhat good but it is just so ridiculous how much product you have to use on your hair to make foam.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if the original sent is any different</li>
            <li>I, like many other people, decided to try this product after seeing infomercial after infomercial.</li>
            <li>Most other shampoos/conditioners bother me</li>
            <li>I have tried many other so called CC&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I like many other people</li>
            <li>at first I thought the excess hair loss was due to stress (I&#x27;m in graduate school and have a full time job too!)</li>
            <li>My hair looked like it had been flat ironed, it was SO smooth.  </li>
            <li>leave my hair very easliy managable and soft, but if I dont wash my hair for a day it gets greasy very very fast.</li>
            <li>: If you have thick ethnic hair due to African, Hispanic, Asian or Mediterranean heritage, this may be the best product you ever use (although there are a lot of really good products out there for ethnic hair that can achieve a similar result in terms of moisture and strengthening of hair)</li>
            <li>My hair is wavy, and when I let it dry natural, I have more definition to my waves.  </li>
            <li>I was glad to find a single bottle on Amazon instead of signing up for monthly delivery, etc that their direct website requires.  </li>
            <li>My hair is fine, dry and frizzy but an oily scalp.</li>
            <li>I usually only use 3 full pumps which is plenty.  </li>
            <li>First of all, get your hair COMPLETELY soaked before you put the product on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also notice my roots aren&#x27;t so visible as they were last week, which is great, as I was getting ready to dye my hair again and can now probably wait at least another week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>WEN is okay, but not worth the price.</li>
            <li>Wish it was available all year long!</li>
            <li>The coconut one smells wonderful but must have different ingredients as it makes my hair very limp and dry.</li>
            <li>It smooths away flyaways and keeps my 10 year olds very long hair tangle free.</li>
            <li>I tried using 2 steady pumps (about one teaspoon) and then rubbed it into my hair and added some water.</li>
            <li>It could possibly work better for someone with  a different hair type.</li>
            <li>but this particular one is creamy.</li>
            <li>I also use regular shampoo a few times a week and then use this as a leave-in conditioner with good results.</li>
            <li>I personally have been satisfied, eliminates traveling with 3 or 4 different items.</li>
            <li>since i paid a decent amount for it, i&#x27;ve decided to use it on my ends as a conditioner, and use a shampoo before hand.  </li>
            <li>However, this particular scent broke me out in a rash wherever it ran when I rinsed.</li>
            <li>but I will not buy that particular scent again.</li>
            <li>We noticed that all you really need is a few pumps not as many as recommended.</li>
            <li>Will definitely get more in the future!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product after over a month of steady use</li>
            <li>but if you are Caucasian or have fine or medium or even thick hair that is not incredibly dry to the point where you can&#x27;t wash it more than twice a week because it will break and fall out, you should NOT USE WEN.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend Wen system to everyone.  </li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;m sold, despite the high price tag.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to anyone</li>
            <li>so I tried it, in spite of the high price.</li>
            <li>I have particularly fine hair and not much of it.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re ok with that, then go with this product, but I like it to be a little stronger.</li>
            <li>I will just sit there and play with my hair because it is so soft!!</li>
            <li>up date my review after a little bit to make sure my hair doesn&#x27;t start falling out, or gradually get an oily build up that some complain of.  </li>
            <li>It left my hair feeling clean and soft.  </li>
            <li>My hair is consistently smooth and very soft when I blow dry it.  </li>
            <li>At first it was hard to get used to this product, but within a week I have grown to LOVE it.</li>
            <li>The Wen spokesperson you may have seen most on TV is Alyssa Milano, a beautiful Italian girl who has thick, rich, dark ethnic hair that only looks fine/thin because of her overuse of hair dyes, styling products and heat due to her career choice and this beauty, while lovely as an actress and probably as a human being, is meant in the Wen commercial to represent the \\&quot;white\\&quot; girls.</li>
            <li>The CC works very well, my hair feels soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>My cheaper shampoos and conditioners leave my hair much shinier and soft.  </li>
            <li>Although I was happy with this bottle I read about the fake bottles going around on Amazon.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re hair soft and it cleanses very well</li>
            <li>We use it like normal conditioner and it works well.</li>
            <li>And what a waste of time to pump 6 times, comb and just to put more on your hair for nothing ...</li>
            <li>Normally my daughter loves the almond</li>
            <li>next test is to see how long this bottle lasts me (i have the 12 oz) and if my hair starts to grow in better and stronger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite scents which is not currently available through wen.</li>
            <li>I tried  the mousse is normally use but that didn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li>I was seeing was just normal for me.</li>
            <li>But I wanted to make sure it wasn&#x27;t going to be all goopy and oily, so I blow dried it.  </li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s partly overcome by being able to forego washing my hair everyday.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair that is just past shoulder length.</li>
            <li>I strongly encourage this product for African American hair.  </li>
            <li>I have wavy somewhat dry hair and this product helps keep my hair from being frizzy and it makes it very easy to style or even air dry.  </li>
            <li>Each scent / flavor is for different hair types so pick the right one.  </li>
            <li>It took me several washings to get it just right for my hair.  </li>
            <li>Other than that I don&#x27;t use hot irons or anything, but my hair was so dry and damaged, it felt like hay (and didn&#x27;t look much better).</li>
            <li>It worked just fine, and my hair handled very well after I dried it.</li>
            <li>Now I don&#x27;t have coarse or curly hair, mine is fine, oily &amp; short, but everyone should try this method before you invest in this &#x27;cleansing conditioner&#x27;:&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li>Many people mention that the sent is very strong and it is, but when you rinse it out after 3 minutes it seems to leave just a very faint sent.</li>
            <li>I do get cheap sometimes and try other cleansing conditioners, or new shampoos that make extravagant promises but</li>
            <li>My only reservation is the cost is pretty high...</li>
            <li>Well this stuff didn&#x27;t live up to the hype.</li>
            <li>A new fragrance to try this summer.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>that nothin new to the hair or body works immediately.</li>
            <li>I live at the beach, and don&#x27;t even check the weather for humidity anymore.</li>
            <li>and it is just as soft and easy to comb as with any other Wen product.</li>
            <li>works great, does what it is supposed to, helps dry, curly hair and thin straight hair, helps all hair types</li>
            <li>but when I switched back to a regular shampoo and conditioner this week I noticed a huge reduction in hair loss.&lt;br</li>
            <li>PLUS, the smell is not as strong as the previous Mango I purchased.  </li>
            <li>My hair has improved, but it did not happen after the first or second applicaton.  </li>
            <li>It has helped restore my hair completely!</li>
            <li>it would make a big difference if was  cheaper.the hair looks somewhat better than the other shampoos</li>
            <li>the Wen Co. On here for the exact same ingredients!</li>
            <li>It also works better than a couple of other Wen scents, such as tea leaves and pomegranate (which don&#x27;t take away frizz as well).</li>
            <li>I have noticed more hair than usual falling out</li>
            <li>I like that the consistency of this scent is much more fluid than some of the other wen scents.</li>
            <li>I could just refill a small bottle from a more bulk supply.</li>
            <li>You will throw away all your other hair products, shampoos and conditioners after trying it, so it&#x27;s worth every penny!  </li>
            <li>but it was even more &amp;#34;flat&#x27; than usual.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Funny, I assumed canceling THREE times would be enough to have them get the</li>
            <li>Do not purchase because you will get a cheap imitation!</li>
            <li>I love it but is very expensive and I will no be able t continue use of this product to do expense</li>
            <li>I also definitely had to do clarifying washes with shampoos pretty frequently.</li>
            <li>I have long hair and have read so many good and bad responses, that I decided to ease into the amount of pumps I am trying.  </li>
            <li>but it can&#x27;t be a coincidence that so many people have the exact same complaint.  </li>
            <li>I am not making medical claims but it has certainly worked for me.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it my hair felt very soft and full bodied, but after a few uses you feel like you need to use regular shampoo,</li>
            <li>I was used to losing a good bit of hair, each time I washed (every other day), but in the last 3 weeks, it has come down to just 2 or 3 hairs, as opposed to about 20.  </li>
            <li>The Summer Mango Coconut scent is great during this cold weather.</li>
            <li>I HEARD IT WAS RETIRED CLEARLY</li>
            <li>, skin was nearly clear again, had just come across this article</li>
            <li>My hair has completely transformed.</li>
            <li>It did not feel soft and conditioned.  </li>
            <li>It did make my hair soft and shiny in the shower.</li>
            <li>The key here is to not over do it and go in gently.  </li>
            <li>It has really helped my longer hair, especially from midway to the ends.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair so soft.</li>
            <li>My hair has become so much softer since switching to this &amp;#34;shampoo&amp;#34; and only washing every 3 or 4 days.</li>
            <li>Use at least three pumps (more for thicker hair).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have lost so much hair and my hair looks gross and greasy-</li>
            <li>The smell is complete PERFECTION.</li>
            <li>Completely changed my hair.</li>
            <li>I able to detangle hair after I let it sit on for at least 15 mins.</li>
            <li>The bottle is far from ergonomic, either.</li>
            <li>one leaves my unruly hair soft &amp; silky.</li>
            <li>especially if you go to the gym and sweat alot your hair will be greasey no matter how much of the product you use.  </li>
            <li>(yes), makes hair soft (yes), does miracles (no).</li>
            <li>and I wish I had not wasted $32.00 on this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>If any of them posessed common sense they would know better</li>
            <li>Your hair should be saturated with the product and keep it on for the duration of the shower before cleansing completely.</li>
            <li>My weekend of fooling my nose into thinking I&#x27;m near the beach...</li>
            <li>my  legs  are  soft  </li>
            <li>Cleans hair, leaving soft, silky and bouncy.</li>
            <li>Pass the frozen coconut adult libations, please!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was really impressed as my hair dried because the soft, silky texture was something I had never experienced before!</li>
            <li>It is so soft and shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair was not frizzy and my natural curls were just like when I was a kid before I started dying and straightening my hair.</li>
            <li>I also am not using as much as the directions say, because I still have 1/4 bottle left, and it should all be gone by now.  </li>
            <li>I could actually see my layers, because my hair had so much movement.  </li>
            <li>It was as soft as my babies hair.  </li>
            <li>Smells divine, and keeps my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair and this stuff is a dream for it.</li>
            <li>, some WEN&#x27; s have worked different on my hair, AND I never use as many pumps as they say it&#x27;s just a waste, use what u feel is needed with</li>
            <li>your palm put 1/2 the amount of shampoo you would normally use along with about the same amount you normally used for conditioner.</li>
            <li>Any Wen product is worth it, I will not ever go back to regular shampoo or conditioner.</li>
            <li>REALLY well, and that my friend will not happen again, unless you got the wrong kind for your hair.  </li>
            <li>I heard this product was kind of thin</li>
            <li>love how soft, shiny, thick, &amp; bouncy my hair looks...</li>
            <li>I have tried several of the other scents and for my chemistry and smell sensitivities, this is the ONLY one I love.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s harder to get the right amount out of the bottle having to squeeze it out</li>
            <li>I have very curly, dry, freezy hair and always looking to try new products.</li>
            <li>the other hand, it feels lovely when you put it on and smells great.&lt;br /&gt;However, certainly not one of my &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; products</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it everyday, but when I do it makes my hair soft and clean.</li>
            <li>The key is figuring out how much product to use, how much to scrub and lather, and how long to rinse.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not crazy about the other products you get in the Wen package (styling products and rewetting mist)</li>
            <li>She loves this product but she only washes her hair once or twice a week, at the most, washing that she used accomplish using an oil-wash followed by a deep conditioner which is oddly sort of how I would describe Wen, which she now uses for her once/twice a week hair routine, oily, sticky, deep-conditioning Wen.</li>
            <li>I am older, and my hair is colored, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to wash out like when I used regular shampoo.</li>
            <li>My hair feels and looks exactly the same as when I use my regular products.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t fond of the smell, and this particular WEN left my hair greasy.</li>
            <li>Also, I&#x27;m going to order L&#x27;oreal&#x27;s Evercreme cleansing conditioner because I read in its reviews that it does exactly the same thing for a third of the price.  </li>
            <li>because it doesn&#x27;t feel as clean to me; with that said I will use it occasionally as the only product to \\&quot;wash\\&quot; my hair, but I use it daily as a conditioner which helps because I have super thick/coarse hair and this product helps to tame my locks without leaving residue on my hair.</li>
            <li>(mine is medium in thickness, medium brown, and growing out of a pale white British scalp and hers is lush, thick, beautiful, spiral curling African American hair that is very dry and needs a lot of oil to keep from becoming brittle).</li>
            <li>I am stoked to use something new, in the fall I would go back to our old favorites though.</li>
            <li>and I love what they do for my hair, but, the smell was not good.  </li>
            <li>I usually order from QVC, but since this isn&#x27;t available in the winter i decided to give amazon a try.</li>
            <li>Actually,  I would love them to sell it year round in the larger size.</li>
            <li>The bottle is a different size than normal and it did not come with a pump head.  </li>
            <li>I have actually gone well over a week before with zero shampoo - only getting my hair wet and &amp;#34;washing&amp;#34; with a cheap conditioner like Suave - and at the end of the week I barely had any oils my hair.  </li>
            <li>and it smelled lovely, but I&#x27;d rather have my hair feel clean and soft not dirty, coarse, and heavy, though it didn&#x27;t look dirty.</li>
            <li>Love the smell been ordering Wen on auto delivery for about 2-yrs straight now through Guthy Renker 2as sometimes getting the wrong order</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and have issues with shampoos making my scalp itchy and red.</li>
            <li>Only problem is I don&#x27;t think I want that scent year round and wish it didn&#x27;t cost so much!!!  </li>
            <li>I mean if you think your hair is rinsed, go back in and rinse it some more.  </li>
            <li>My hair was brittle and majorly damaged from repeated dying and bleaching.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little pricey, but worth it.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a little pricy but worth the cost.</li>
            <li>The product seems to be a bit too heavy and by the second day I feel it&#x27;s time the wash again in ordert feel clean.</li>
            <li>Due to severe Trichotillomania as a child, my hair grew back in several different textures ranging from extremely kinky to fine and straight.  </li>
            <li>It was much stronger than expected.</li>
            <li>This product is fake!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;After going to the WEN web site and participating dealers to find the &amp;#34;mango coconut&amp;#34; scent, I found out that this product was a fake and further more, when compared to a real WEN product the evidence is proof!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>product must be several years old.</li>
            <li>They all make my hair sooooo soft and healhy looking.&lt;br /&gt;I will not be purchasing this specific scent again though.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve Ben using WEN for years now and my hair as never been healthier or prettier - except when I was younger and didn&#x27;t have stubborn grays or frequent coloring to hide said grays.  </li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m naturally a brunette who was meant to be a blonde).</li>
            <li>My wife wanted to return this sub-par product which did the complete opposite of what they claimed...</li>
            <li>, it wasn&#x27;t until last night that I realized that my mothers use of Wen and my use of Wen started approximately the same time and during this time period both of our heads went from beautiful heads of hair to, sparse limp damaged hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair looks thick and smooth.</li>
            <li>My hair had more sheen and no fly away</li>
            <li>I highly recommend for dry hair.</li>
            <li>After getting out of the shower by hair would be so dry and thirsty for moisture it would get frizzy in any kind of humidity (not good in Western Washington weather).</li>
            <li>I have tried almost all of the other types of the WEN cleansing conditioners, &amp;#34;Summer Mango Coconut&amp;#34; is my all time favorite, I use it all year round!</li>
            <li>You can buy here on Amazon for a decent cost and will last for a long while.</li>
            <li>/&gt;just called Wen by Chaz Dean and because I order in large quantities every 3 months, there policy is they&#x27;ll buy back products (including empty bottles)</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really like the auto-ship every month though, and don&#x27;t use the other products, just the cleansing conditioner.  </li>
            <li>it also moisturizes extremely well and cleanses very well</li>
            <li>Lavendar and Gardenia Green Tea make my hair a little more bouncy.</li>
            <li>It did help tremendously with my dry ends, and it doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down.  </li>
            <li>I will still wash the top half of my head in the sink every other day; don&#x27;t want to dry out the ends by washing it too often.</li>
            <li>WEN makes my hair soft and manageable even on African American hair.</li>
            <li>I have surly hair that is never dry because of Wen.</li>
            <li>We usually use the basic Sweet Almond Mint</li>
            <li>My hair is very soft and no longer feels dry.  </li>
            <li>Plus, if you actually used the exact amount of pumps they advise, you&#x27;d use up the 16oz bottle in less than 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After calling back again and waiting an hour again to speak to a live individual I was finally informed by a \\&quot;supervisor\\&quot; the account would finally be canceled and I would receive my refund.</li>
            <li>A female African American friend insisted I try this, in spite of the marked difference in our hair</li>
            <li>Have to use six pumps to do my hair, which is not long.  </li>
            <li>and I barely had to do any extra styling.  </li>
            <li>My hair felt heavy and looked greasy after the first use.</li>
            <li>This Mango Coconut leaves my hair full &amp; thick</li>
            <li>So I decided to purchase 2 more bottles unfortunally the 2nd purchase of this product left my hair very oily and dirty looking.</li>
            <li>- they make my hair feel soft and manageable (and I have long, curly, frizzy hair!)</li>
            <li>People that have fine or thin hair seem to say it just makes their hair greasy.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for so much and got so little.</li>
            <li>so i did not use too much or too little</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and usually just falls flat when I blow dry it, so I had to use mousse or gels which make my hair feel strange.</li>
            <li>This is one of those rare instances where ethnic background does, unfortunately rule out certain people as clients of a company.</li>
            <li>I do have thin, fine hair that&#x27;s naturally blonde but currently a 3RB color.</li>

            <li> This is by far the best smelling Wen I&#x27;ve tried yet.</li>

            <li> THE INFOMMERCIAL SAID IT WOULD AND SMELLS AMAZING:)</li>
            <li> Wow, what an awesome product!  </li>
            <li> After one use it literally worked some kind of magic on my hair.</li>
            <li> All WEN products make my hair happy, but I&#x27;m not crazy about all the scents they offer.</li>
            <li> and i LOVE LOVE LOVE how my hair feels now!</li>
            <li> I have fine, straight gray hair and it is just wonderful!</li>

            <li> It worked great the first time and now it seems as though the conditioner is building up in my hair.</li>
            <li> Even my hair color looks more like it did when I was younger, the shine is amazing and if feels wonderful.</li>
            <li> For all you gals that haven&#x27;t tried Wen yet, this is a great scent to try first.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Summary:  Worked great the first time, except the pump broke (hence the 4 stars instead of 5).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not getting a very smooth result.</li>
            <li> to use it is very important.</li>
            <li> That method was great and super cheap, but it did leave a waxy build-up on my hair over time.</li>
            <li> These scent is ok</li>
            <li> Such a wonderful company to work with.  </li>
            <li> I love anything WEN.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this mango coconut cleansing conditioner.  </li>

            <li> I love this shampoo and my hair has never been healthier.</li>

            <li> I dont&#x27; mind spending more for this product</li>
            <li> I use it as more of a once a week conditioning treatment because of the price -</li>
            <li> but more like spring break</li>
            <li> I love the way that Wen feels in my hair.</li>
            <li> Which is okay.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using WEN for years, and I love the price.  </li>

            <li> Ok, one word.....</li>
            <li> Enjoy!</li>
            <li> I love the WEN hair products....</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> has a wonderful smell but it leaves my hair feeling greasy after a day which with my regular shampoo and conditoner does not</li>
            <li> love how my hair feels</li>
            <li> That is over the top.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I love the feel of my hair</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> It was better to buy here without having to be automatically shipped.</li>
            <li> I use it as a conditioner and love the results.</li>
            <li> &amp; I have found that it works better for me if I dilute it.</li>
            <li> The deal on there is actually better for 2 bottles.</li>
            <li> I love the smell...</li>
            <li> Head and shoulders works leaps and bounds better.</li>
            <li> I love Wen Cleansing conditioners.  </li>
            <li> Love the Wen system.  </li>
            <li> Love the summer smell</li>
            <li> Okay, so I&#x27;m still using this one bottle of WEN after over a month.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how it compares, but I love it.  </li>
            <li> Love it..</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> LOVE this product.......</li>
            <li> My favorite smelling Wen to date.</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my hair feel</li>
            <li> The smell is the best next to the pomegranate.  </li>
            <li> I love the product.  </li>
            <li> I love coconut mango anything, and this was just what the doctor ordered.</li>
            <li> glad I did.</li>
            <li> I just bought the winter vanilla mint to try and love that too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s tingly like the 6-13 but smells way better.</li>
            <li> not Fig because I love more tropical</li>
            <li> Umm-m-m, love the fragrance of this product and how my hair stops frizzing out after shampooing.</li>
            <li> all the time not just seasonal! :)</li>
            <li> This conditioner makes my hair silky smooth!</li>
            <li> Next we received a collection letter from the wonderful people over at Wen.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure at some point the Better Business Bureau will get to the bottom of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this summer smell of coconut and mango.</li>
            <li> I love Wen as a conditioner, but it honestly doesn&#x27;t get my hair clean if I try to use it as a cleanser, even if I wash twice.</li>
            <li> I have tried several of the Wen cleansers (almond mint, pom, cucumber and pumpkin), but Mango Coconut is my favorite!!!</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t order it in the first place!!!</li>
            <li> My wife was very excited when she ordered this product</li>
            <li> one step to beautiful, soft hair!  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s natural beautiful curl that I get so many complements on.</li>
            <li> tangly-breakage - but not so far this year, thank you!!!!!!!  </li>
            <li> I loved this product when I first got it.</li>
            <li> but I paid good money for a product that I won&#x27;t use again after the first couple times.</li>
            <li> It makes it soft, healthier, and smelling beautiful.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;I have always loved Wen because the moisturizing in it helped me to grow my hair to midback length for the first time in my life.  </li>
            <li> Wen leaves my hair full and easy to manage and I LOVE this smell!</li>
            <li> I find that it works best on color treated and dry hair.</li>
            <li> It smells great and works nice as a leave-in conditioner, but it didn&#x27;t make my hair extra shiny or manageable.</li>
            <li> I loved the smell but it only worked good on my hair for about a month.  </li>
            <li> WEN Cleansing Conditioner does a great job on my hair leaving it very soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li> This scent was new for me, but very nice.  </li>
            <li> I have written many reviews on WEN, and nothing has changed; This is a fantastic cleansing conditioner.</li>
            <li> My hair looks great and is so soft without any frizz.</li>
            <li> this product is becoming too pricey for the performance</li>
            <li> We love the silky smooth manageable feeling we get from wen.</li>
            <li> more then the Sweet Almond Mint and smells 20x&#x27;s better as well.</li>
            <li> I love the product and will enjoy using it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Leaves hair smelling great and soft.  </li>
            <li> This product is ok,  not as fantastic as the commercials lead you to believe.  </li>
            <li> it sure does make my hair look healthy and full.</li>
            <li> I think the WEN is great to use part time not everyday, it seemed to make my hair too oily, after prolonged use.  </li>
            <li> My hair smells great and is soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> This one smells really good, very summery.</li>
            <li> I have tried Wen before from a friend and loved it so much I wanted to order it myself.</li>
            <li> I decided to stay on until I spoke with a REAL PERSON (I recommend getting a good book to read while you wait.)</li>
            <li> I think its because of the coconut in it, my hair is at its best when I&#x27;m using this particular bottle, &amp;#34;Vanilla Mint&amp;#34; would have to be my second favorite!</li>
            <li> MORE THEN THE ORIGINAL FORMULA.FOR PEOPLE OF COLOR</li>
            <li> I feel that the original almond mint Wen smells and works better than this one...</li>
            <li> The smell is so yummy and sweet!</li>
            <li> It is the ONLY one that smells good!</li>
            <li> I returned it and Amazon was very quick with a refund.</li>
            <li> I had reservations for sure and did not want to believe a conditioner could actually clean my hair</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t feel my hair was clean or more shiny</li>
            <li> I love WEN, but this one didnt really clean my hair.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would strongly recommend that EVERYONE give this product a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product works wonders and I HIGHLY recommend it to anyone looking for a good change.</li>
            <li> I love this product, however for me I have to use shampoo to wash my hair (specially after a work out)</li>
            <li> So soft and smells amazing!</li>
            <li> Ok, so now that I&#x27;ve tried the Sweet Almond Mint and the Tea Tree, I just had to try the Summer Mango Coconut</li>
            <li> I am a true Wen girl. :)</li>
            <li> also use the Intensive Moist Hair Treatment Sweet Almond in conjunction with the Mango Coconut Cleansing/Conditioner with every \\&quot;shampoo\\&quot; and I love the results.  </li>
            <li> so I seen the Summer Mango and thought it would smell sexy and it does it smells so tropical and sweet</li>
            <li> I looked down and saw a section of hair form into a perfect ringlet.  </li>
            <li> This scent is delicious and keeps smelling great, even if I go an extra day between cleansings (unlike one or two of the other scents).  </li>
            <li> Fine, but lots of hair, and it is somewhere between wavy and curly, prone to frizz.</li>
            <li> I have fine, color treated hair.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair that is highlighted.</li>
            <li> The product itself is fine, but the pump does not work at all.</li>
            <li> I bought this product several weeks ago and was very impressed at first-</li>
            <li> My winter Cranberry Mint arrived quickly and my hair has been fabulous ever since!</li>
            <li> my hair smelled great and felt super soft-</li>
            <li> I have noticed more fly-aways around my part, but that may just be new hair growth since my scalp is more healthy.  </li>
            <li> I have fine light colored hair.  </li>
            <li> Since I started using WEN, my hair is healthy, shiny, manageable and plain amazing!!</li>
            <li> I love the Wen cleansing conditioner so much that I returned to QVC to purchase products for my mom, sister and three friends for upcoming birthdays!!</li>
            <li> checked the label what a HUGE difference with not using now</li>
            <li> Received item as described, fast delivery, nice packaging.</li>
            <li> I get different scents and have been happy.</li>
            <li> This is a great product - if used properly.</li>
            <li> Go tresemee fantastic product.</li>
            <li> I personally like to have great smelling hair and the Summer Mango</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s seasonal and not always available.  </li>
            <li> I have used a few of the Wen flavors and I have to say that this one is the best!</li>
            <li> I knew I was getting genuine product.  </li>
            <li> is fantastic.</li>
            <li> My hair is fantastic using the WEN cleansing conditioners.  </li>
            <li> this is one product that smells great, and is just the slippery creamy sulfate free conditioner that is great for all hair types ESPECIALLY African American kinks, curls and coils!</li>
            <li> This Cleansing Conditioner is great and the commercial on TV is correct.</li>
            <li> But this cleansing conditioner is fabulous.  </li>
            <li> Wish it was always available.</li>
            <li> Coconut is such a great smell for summer</li>
            <li> I will continue to buy Wen from Amazon because I feel comfortable in knowing I control my purchases.</li>
            <li> Mango really smells nice.</li>
            <li> this is by far the best conditioner ever left my hair shiny and soft and I have corse curly hair so happy with this product</li>
            <li> It keeps my daughters hair shiny and knot free.  </li>
            <li> When I use Wen, it&#x27;s so smooth - but still wavy.</li>
            <li> It feels really smooth and silky even while lathering your hair.  </li>
            <li> I will probably try to fall and winter scents when they become available.</li>
            <li> I have used Pantene 2 in 1 shampoo and conditioner for smooth hair and then the Pantene smooth conditioner for years.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe it, because I read some reviews that said it causes hair loss, but I&#x27;ve experienced the opposite.  </li>
            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t quite smooth and detangle as well.  </li>
            <li> Coconut is light, with a hint of mango, and it&#x27;s kinda vanillawee too.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> MAke PUmpkin available and this available</li>
            <li> So far,  so good.</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal sulfate free body conditioner does NOT contain MCI and MI; and I must admit my hair actually smelled better, felt better and looked better as well:)  </li>
            <li> Smells so good and leaves my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> but the sound of this special summer scent appealed to us.</li>
            <li> WEN is such an amazing product!</li>
            <li> NOT IF MY WONDERFUL AMAZON HAS IT, ONE OF THE FEW WEN PRODUCTS THAT ACTUALLY SMELLS GOOD</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t familiar with.</li>
            <li> this a try, it&#x27;s worth the money!</li>
            <li> I am not disappointed.</li>
            <li> However, I didn&#x27;t like the auto order and pay you have to sign up for with original Wen.</li>
            <li> : Make sure you really rinse the product out well!</li>
            <li> know tons of people love this product, but who can spend that much money for hair cleanser?!</li>
            <li> I am an avid Wen user and love it.  </li>
            <li> That being said, when I received my bottle of WEN, I was excited to use it &amp; see how it holds up to the claims on the infomercial.</li>
            <li> I am going to try the Original formula...</li>
            <li> and my hair is always shiny and clean.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair &amp; scalp feel sqeaky clean.</li>
            <li> My hair feels healthier, its shinier, it stay clean longer</li>
            <li> But Wen makes it both clean and conditioned.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel clean when I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li> I was kind of worried about paying this much for a hair care product, but it was worth it.  </li>
            <li> it makes my hair super silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> This really is a great Cleansing Conditioner for my daughter that has dry wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> In addition, it helped maintain the color longer than when I used shampoo and condition to clean my hair.  </li>
            <li> and I would have to wash it twice with Wen to get it clean</li>
            <li> If you have to have suds to feel your hair is clean, this is not for you, but I guarantee you, it does clean your hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair felt clean and not waxy.</li>
            <li> Second time I order Wen by Caz Dean cleansing conditioner I&#x27;m very happy with it, and I love the price and such quick service.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Wen for years and Mango Coconut is by far my favorite!</li>
            <li> Makes my hair so soft &amp; healthy!</li>
            <li> but this scent has so far been my favorite!  </li>
            <li> I started using WEN and within the week my hair felt so soft and looked fantastic!!</li>
            <li> Wen is nothing special, nothing to write home about.</li>
            <li> the mango coconut has a great smell and it lasts all day long!!!</li>
            <li> Have enjoyed it so much.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as fuzzy, and the bottom of my hair is much fuller and not straggly any more.</li>
            <li> Really get in there and make sure the product is in at the scalp level.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t take it any more and went back to my sulfate free botanical shampoo and my hair and scalp feel so much better.</li>
            <li> But, I really like the Renpure better.</li>
            <li> everyone wants to know how I keep it so healthy.</li>
            <li> it simply sounds like it will smell so good.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair soft, but it smells like some kind of dog shampoo or flea bath...</li>
            <li> Too sweet.</li>
            <li> It feels so much healthier and is much more manageable...</li>
            <li> Your hair will smell of exotic places and sexy suntanned bodies, whew, better take a sec to compose myself...........</li>
            <li> With this magic potion, I can wear my hair straight or curly.</li>
            <li> if I did 10 full pumps</li>
            <li> but one full pump size is about the size of a quarter.</li>
            <li> Does smell good especially for t he summer</li>
            <li> Most surprising of all I am losing 2/3 less hair than I was.</li>
            <li> I have not used other products, but the shampoo is great.</li>
            <li> Wish they would give you a minimum time you should keep it on before rinsing as I take really quick showers.  </li>
            <li> Delivered quickly.</li>
            <li> Still smells good, but it gets old fast.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this, and my hair simply behaves better.</li>
            <li> i have hair that gets oily fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li> - have tried many different products for tangles and many DO NOT work-</li>
            <li> I think the people that experienced hair loss, we&#x27;re just not use to combing out their hair in the shower, and seeing how much they were actually losing all along.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line: it is a good overall product that is worth the money</li>
            <li> If you have very long hair and decide to do 36 full pumps good luck getting it into your hand(s).</li>
            <li> The pump didn&#x27;t fit the bottle and it smells nothing like the first bottle I had ordered from Wen.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27; wondering if this is for real or is this a pitch for the consumer to use a lot at a time thus increasing the need to buy more more frequently.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much!</li>
            <li> I tried my new WEN product and am less than impressed.  </li>
            <li> but it needs the conditioner to be the carrier for the shampoo which is why you have to use so much of the cream, or even wash it twice to get clean, grease free hair.</li>
            <li> let me find my swimsuit:)  Love the smell and will be conditioning (leaving it in for a long time)</li>
            <li> And apply just a tiny amount of jojoba oil on my hair after blowdrying, makes my hair shiny and freezy free!!</li>
            <li> Using this for the first time, I thought that the cream seemed really rich and</li>
            <li> There is no &amp;#34;sudsing action&amp;#34;, and you may feel like your hair isn&#x27;t really clean at first.</li>
            <li> Hard to get use to no suds, but it certainly makes your hair feel great!!</li>
            <li> As far as I know, she likes it very much!!!</li>
            <li> Makes a HUGE difference for my whole family.</li>
            <li> Wen is AMAZING of your trying to bring strength back to your hair.!</li>
            <li> The Summer Mango Coconut is by far my favorite scent.</li>
            <li> I guess I wasn&#x27;t thrilled with the outcome of the product because I don&#x27;t use it enough to see if it works over time.  </li>
            <li> My scalp broke out and my hair does not smell fresh with this product.  </li>
            <li> i love how soft my hair gets using wen</li>
            <li> It has never felt so soft or looked so healthy........</li>
            <li> let it soak in, spend an hour on the whole process, and, in doing it only once a week, not end up hating Chaz Dean for a good portion of every shower they take.</li>
            <li> like Sun and Surf and fun....</li>
            <li> My favorite wen cleanser of all time so far.</li>
            <li> Lightweight and fresh scent</li>
            <li> Shipping procedure was poor at best.  </li>
            <li> but I thought that this would be a fun change for our trip.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried almost all of them and this is my favorite by far.</li>
            <li> this is  the one worth every penney</li>
            <li> We love Wen products (my 17 year old daughter and I)</li>
            <li> cuz I&#x27;m worth it</li>
            <li> ,  it  is  worth  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had several people at work comment on how nice my looks since using this product.  </li>
            <li> The others are eh, but this one is fresh and stays fresh.  </li>
            <li> Love the adult formula too.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t really want to try anything else because I love this so much.</li>
            <li> ( I rarely use hair products)</li>
            <li> Made my daughter&#x27;s curly hair so soft and tangle free!</li>
            <li> so I honestly I didn&#x27;t try it until now because my Aunt has a very big bottle of the Fig Wen and she told me that she likes it</li>
            <li> I have a very full head of very fine hairs--which are very prone to frizz, especially in humid weather.</li>
            <li> The other two are good as well, but this is my favorite so far.</li>
            <li> Color last and looks sooo rich !!</li>
            <li> So I went to the Wen site and ordered the Summer Mango Coconut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It arrived quickly, but after first washing (I followed the directions to a tee)</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it for fine and colored hair.  </li>
            <li> After using this item for over a month, she told me that her hair has not changed much other than I believe it smells good.</li>
            <li> I really like WEN, but I think I&#x27;ll stick with the original sents.</li>
            <li> Great to use here and there but hard to use full time.</li>
            <li> THIS WEN PRODUCT HAS JUST THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF MOISTURIZING AND</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t even try to comb it right when you just scrubbed it</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT WORKS BEST WHEN PUTTING IT ON YOUR HAIR DRY WITH ONLY 5 PUMPS FOR YOUR WHOLE HEAD.THEN LEAVING IT</li>
            <li> The WEN I first bought was the lavender, but the Mango Coconut is by far better for my hair.</li>
            <li> The deep conditioner they send with the shampoo is wonderful, leaves your hair very soft, but the actual shampoo is not working for me.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair feeling soft and clean!</li>
            <li> until I noticed very large clumps of my hair falling out with continued use.</li>
            <li> Ordering was easy &amp; service was better then expected.</li>
            <li> I felt it didnt feel the same as my usual Wen, but once I \\&quot;lathered\\&quot; up and rinsed out, I loved how cleanly it rinsed out..and very easily</li>
            <li> Seems pricey at first, but lasts a while and worth it.</li>
            <li> This was a summer WEN scent and formula that I found to be not only long lasting, thick and creamy, but one of the best, if not the best, of all WEN formulas I have tried.  </li>
            <li> Works well on long hair, the scent is nice and not overpowering</li>
            <li> But people with thick hair will love it, I am sure!</li>
            <li> Really this is a great product, and my wife highly recommends this for anyone with dry damaged or brittle hair.</li>
            <li> Because my hair is so fine, I really don&#x27;t need as much product as the directions give.  </li>
            <li> , I have very fine fragile hair</li>
            <li> Super fast shipment.</li>
            <li> great product, been using for almost two years now - wouldn&#x27;t go back to traditional shampoo.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very, very dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think it would be good for the planet to reduce the number of these little bottles.</li>
            <li> The mango coconut scent is nice but a little too sweet smelling.  </li>
            <li> I do not believe it is worth as much as they charge for it.</li>
            <li> If anyone has direct questions, please feel free to ask me; I have been using WEN for 5 years.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for two years and my hair is completely healthy and back to</li>
            <li> I also really love the fig because my hair is colored and it makes the color shine and last longer.</li>
            <li> so I was interested in trying it.</li>
            <li> but I feel like I need to use more product than recommended to get any lasting results and for the price I can use another conditioner.</li>
            <li> I am a Wen user and have been ever since I first tried a sample packet.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Wen for several months now and will never go back to shampoo, not even the phosphate free kind.  </li>
            <li> Start massaging the product into your scalp first.  </li>
            <li> After the first wash I lost triple the amount of hair</li>
            <li> i used the product three times to make sure i used it properly.  </li>
            <li> Thinning on the top and patches thru out the hair, everyone is reporting the same thing.</li>
            <li> THAT YOU( FIRST) GO THROUGH YOU HAIR WITH YOUR FINGERS AND USE THE COMB,THEN AFTER ALL THIS BLOWDRY</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t make your hair feel any cleaner, just feels like you just skipped the shampoo and went straight to the conditioner!</li>
            <li> This scent is my favorite, only problem</li>
            <li> This works even better than the Almond Mint I have used prior.</li>
            <li> Very summer!  </li>
            <li> I had seen the 30 minute commercial playing at the gym many times.</li>
            <li> I could get my money back, I would, but I am sure</li>
            <li> On my 2nd bottle of this one and will buy more.</li>
            <li> DOnt love it enough to replace those.</li>
            <li> Now, as I&#x27;ve read most of these posts, these women actually expect immediate results as said in the infomercial.</li>
            <li> the first while</li>
            <li> I found the directions call for more use of product than is necessary.  </li>
            <li> Four pumps is enough for my  hair, but others might need more.  </li>
            <li> I really like Wen cleansers - even though they are rather pricey!</li>
            <li> Love the different flavors and the product.  </li>
            <li> I still supplement occasionally with a favorite shampoo too.</li>
            <li> I have tried WEN many time always to go back to shampoo after a while.  </li>
            <li> I find the condition of my hair to actually look better.  </li>
            <li> While many rave about the Winter Vanilla Mint - I like to think of summer in the middle of winter.  </li>
            <li> I love the smell of anything fruity or this purchase was a big plus.</li>
            <li> Order arrived fast!</li>
            <li> It is smooth, soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> Ok I&#x27;m a guy with short hair</li>
            <li> It lasts longer and it actually works better for me this way.</li>
            <li> First off</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been playing around with how many pumps works for me and everyone will probably be different.  </li>
            <li> So my next purchase will be with QVC just to be safe.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft, silky, smooth, and it moves around a lot.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just ordered more in a different flavor.  </li>
            <li> This was my first time purchasing Wen from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Love the scent - will miss it until next summer!</li>
            <li> First I wanna say that I&#x27;ve seen the commercials on Wen a lot</li>
            <li> It doesnt lather like most shampoos and such, but it works.</li>
            <li> A few had and LOVED it</li>
            <li> I am fairly new to WEN cleansing conditioner, I have bought this conditoner and the Sweet Almond Mint one, designed for all hair types but no comparison for me the Summer Mango definetley hydrated my hair 20x&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Really good!&lt;br /&gt;Finally someone at Wen took notice that all their products stink...and got it right</li>
            <li> have very fine hair and it tends towards the dry side at the ends.  </li>
            <li> It makes her hair feel clean and soft .</li>
            <li> Nice smell, but not worth the higher price.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrence and enjoy using it everyday.</li>
            <li> The Mango-Coconut formula is very hydrating, more so than the Pomegranate, about the same as the Fig.  </li>
            <li> This is a good product the smell wasn&#x27;t too harsh and left my hair smelling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> have used other wen  such as pumpkin spice with great results.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Thanks to Wen and Thanks to Amazon.com!</li>
            <li> I used the recommended amount at first and found it was too much-</li>
            <li> but it was great for all of us - soft and silky hair and not at all heavy or greasy, even if my kids didn&#x27;t get it completely rinsed out!!!  </li>
            <li> I am obsessed with how amazing my hair looks with the wen products!!</li>
            <li> I get much better results in assisting with my dry hair with this product</li>
            <li> After about 12 pumps, I saw large amounts of product on the shower floor.</li>
            <li> then I comb through it as directed with the large toothed comb.</li>
            <li> this purchase was a gift as you can&#x27;t get that scent after a certain period of time.</li>
            <li> Wen builds up on hair, takes forever to rinse out and is not suitable as a cleanser for anyone who spends a good amount of time outdoors or exercising.</li>
            <li> smells good and works really nice , but if you use as much as the say to use each time , it could get very expensive.</li>
            <li> This has definitely been my favorite Wen so far!  </li>
            <li> I found this one to be the slickest, and a little dab works nicely as a leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li> The coconut smell is faint once on, but in the shower it smells amazing :)</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s worth at least one bottle to try the cleansing conditioner as the results are amazing</li>
            <li> Fast shipment also.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much.</li>
            <li> Very costly though.  </li>
            <li> so i don&#x27;t have to  use as much as the product states</li>
            <li> A bottle for me lasts 5 months since i don&#x27;t need to wash my hair as much as i needed to before.</li>
            <li> Went through product to fast.</li>
            <li> Fast shipment</li>
            <li> I really thought this product would work for both a shampoo and conditioner (to save time and $$)</li>
            <li> This is not the real Wen shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I did give it to a co-worker who has medium-thick, straight hair, and she loves it.  </li>
            <li> and she really likes it.</li>
            <li> It has to be washed out really well</li>
            <li> but I really like it.  </li>
            <li> This formula, probably because of the coconut, is a very dense, moisturizing formula of Wen.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for four days....not really noticing much difference.  </li>
            <li> A real bargain.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I got the real WEN or the knock-off version...</li>
            <li> IF YOU DON&#x27;T USE THIS PRODUCT THIS WAY OR SIMULAR TO THIS,IT BECOMES VERY TANGLED</li>
            <li> but I suspect that I wouldn&#x27;t have much shine.</li>
            <li> and it does seem to be quite gentle.  </li>
            <li> This product really works the way it was described on TV.</li>
            <li> I found this one and the mango coconut scent is really what caught my attention.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t buy it again and dont really recommend</li>
            <li> I really believe it is using Wen.</li>
            <li> I really despise the smell of this to the point that I just won&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> I enjoy almost all the different fragrances and having been using Wen for over a decade.</li>
            <li> and it really gave my hair body, shine, and life.</li>
            <li> I really like the tropical Mango Coconut</li>
            <li> products are very pricey</li>
            <li> I think this might actually be my absolute wen fragrance/formula.</li>
            <li> I am using S Factor which is much easier, cheaper, and</li>
            <li> What I really like about WEN is no matter how much I need to get those tangles out of my daughter&#x27;s hair - it doesn&#x27;t make her hair greasy.  </li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t really like the smell too much.</li>
            <li> Every ten days I lightly use a shampoo to do a thorough cleansing</li>
            <li> So I don&#x27;t think I will not spend this much money again....</li>
            <li> However, I noticed that it really is a CLEANSING conditioner as I rinsed the product.</li>
            <li> I am really tempted to try the Sally&#x27;s version which is much cheaper</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> but I think they want you to use so much</li>
            <li> It is very tangly, so</li>
            <li> Fast shipping</li>
            <li> Also, i didn&#x27;t need to use as much of the product as recommended.</li>
            <li> Smell great but no great results with conditioning.</li>
            <li> I really like the product, just wish the bottle was the size it used to come in.</li>
            <li> I have been using Wen for 2 years and really like it.  </li>
            <li> I have curly hair and this really detangles.  </li>
            <li> love how this makes my hair feel healthier and soft without the extra weight.....</li>
            <li> My hair is now soft and shiny!!!</li>
            <li> As someone approaching retirement and due to have to manage a fixed income, I won&#x27;t be able to afford this product that I love.  </li>
            <li> this product is somewhat good but it is just so ridiculous how much product you have to use on your hair to make foam.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if the original sent is any different</li>
            <li> I, like many other people, decided to try this product after seeing infomercial after infomercial.</li>
            <li> Most other shampoos/conditioners bother me</li>
            <li> I have tried many other so called CC&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I like many other people</li>
            <li> at first I thought the excess hair loss was due to stress (I&#x27;m in graduate school and have a full time job too!)</li>
            <li> My hair looked like it had been flat ironed, it was SO smooth.  </li>
            <li> leave my hair very easliy managable and soft, but if I dont wash my hair for a day it gets greasy very very fast.</li>
            <li> : If you have thick ethnic hair due to African, Hispanic, Asian or Mediterranean heritage, this may be the best product you ever use (although there are a lot of really good products out there for ethnic hair that can achieve a similar result in terms of moisture and strengthening of hair)</li>
            <li> My hair is wavy, and when I let it dry natural, I have more definition to my waves.  </li>
            <li> I was glad to find a single bottle on Amazon instead of signing up for monthly delivery, etc that their direct website requires.  </li>
            <li> My hair is fine, dry and frizzy but an oily scalp.</li>
            <li> I usually only use 3 full pumps which is plenty.  </li>
            <li> First of all, get your hair COMPLETELY soaked before you put the product on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also notice my roots aren&#x27;t so visible as they were last week, which is great, as I was getting ready to dye my hair again and can now probably wait at least another week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> WEN is okay, but not worth the price.</li>
            <li> Wish it was available all year long!</li>
            <li> The coconut one smells wonderful but must have different ingredients as it makes my hair very limp and dry.</li>
            <li> It smooths away flyaways and keeps my 10 year olds very long hair tangle free.</li>
            <li> I tried using 2 steady pumps (about one teaspoon) and then rubbed it into my hair and added some water.</li>
            <li> It could possibly work better for someone with  a different hair type.</li>
            <li> but this particular one is creamy.</li>
            <li> I also use regular shampoo a few times a week and then use this as a leave-in conditioner with good results.</li>
            <li> I personally have been satisfied, eliminates traveling with 3 or 4 different items.</li>
            <li> since i paid a decent amount for it, i&#x27;ve decided to use it on my ends as a conditioner, and use a shampoo before hand.  </li>
            <li> However, this particular scent broke me out in a rash wherever it ran when I rinsed.</li>
            <li> but I will not buy that particular scent again.</li>
            <li> We noticed that all you really need is a few pumps not as many as recommended.</li>
            <li> Will definitely get more in the future!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product after over a month of steady use</li>
            <li> but if you are Caucasian or have fine or medium or even thick hair that is not incredibly dry to the point where you can&#x27;t wash it more than twice a week because it will break and fall out, you should NOT USE WEN.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend Wen system to everyone.  </li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;m sold, despite the high price tag.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to anyone</li>
            <li> so I tried it, in spite of the high price.</li>
            <li> I have particularly fine hair and not much of it.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re ok with that, then go with this product, but I like it to be a little stronger.</li>
            <li> I will just sit there and play with my hair because it is so soft!!</li>
            <li> up date my review after a little bit to make sure my hair doesn&#x27;t start falling out, or gradually get an oily build up that some complain of.  </li>
            <li> It left my hair feeling clean and soft.  </li>
            <li> My hair is consistently smooth and very soft when I blow dry it.  </li>
            <li> At first it was hard to get used to this product, but within a week I have grown to LOVE it.</li>
            <li> The Wen spokesperson you may have seen most on TV is Alyssa Milano, a beautiful Italian girl who has thick, rich, dark ethnic hair that only looks fine/thin because of her overuse of hair dyes, styling products and heat due to her career choice and this beauty, while lovely as an actress and probably as a human being, is meant in the Wen commercial to represent the \\&quot;white\\&quot; girls.</li>
            <li> The CC works very well, my hair feels soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> My cheaper shampoos and conditioners leave my hair much shinier and soft.  </li>
            <li> Although I was happy with this bottle I read about the fake bottles going around on Amazon.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re hair soft and it cleanses very well</li>
            <li> We use it like normal conditioner and it works well.</li>
            <li> And what a waste of time to pump 6 times, comb and just to put more on your hair for nothing ...</li>
            <li> Normally my daughter loves the almond</li>
            <li> next test is to see how long this bottle lasts me (i have the 12 oz) and if my hair starts to grow in better and stronger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite scents which is not currently available through wen.</li>
            <li> I tried  the mousse is normally use but that didn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li> I was seeing was just normal for me.</li>
            <li> But I wanted to make sure it wasn&#x27;t going to be all goopy and oily, so I blow dried it.  </li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s partly overcome by being able to forego washing my hair everyday.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair that is just past shoulder length.</li>
            <li> I strongly encourage this product for African American hair.  </li>
            <li> I have wavy somewhat dry hair and this product helps keep my hair from being frizzy and it makes it very easy to style or even air dry.  </li>
            <li> Each scent / flavor is for different hair types so pick the right one.  </li>
            <li> It took me several washings to get it just right for my hair.  </li>
            <li> Other than that I don&#x27;t use hot irons or anything, but my hair was so dry and damaged, it felt like hay (and didn&#x27;t look much better).</li>
            <li> It worked just fine, and my hair handled very well after I dried it.</li>
            <li> Now I don&#x27;t have coarse or curly hair, mine is fine, oily &amp; short, but everyone should try this method before you invest in this &#x27;cleansing conditioner&#x27;:&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> Many people mention that the sent is very strong and it is, but when you rinse it out after 3 minutes it seems to leave just a very faint sent.</li>
            <li> I do get cheap sometimes and try other cleansing conditioners, or new shampoos that make extravagant promises but</li>
            <li> My only reservation is the cost is pretty high...</li>
            <li> Well this stuff didn&#x27;t live up to the hype.</li>
            <li> A new fragrance to try this summer.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> that nothin new to the hair or body works immediately.</li>
            <li> I live at the beach, and don&#x27;t even check the weather for humidity anymore.</li>
            <li> and it is just as soft and easy to comb as with any other Wen product.</li>
            <li> works great, does what it is supposed to, helps dry, curly hair and thin straight hair, helps all hair types</li>
            <li> but when I switched back to a regular shampoo and conditioner this week I noticed a huge reduction in hair loss.&lt;br</li>
            <li> PLUS, the smell is not as strong as the previous Mango I purchased.  </li>
            <li> My hair has improved, but it did not happen after the first or second applicaton.  </li>
            <li> It has helped restore my hair completely!</li>
            <li> it would make a big difference if was  cheaper.the hair looks somewhat better than the other shampoos</li>
            <li> the Wen Co. On here for the exact same ingredients!</li>
            <li> It also works better than a couple of other Wen scents, such as tea leaves and pomegranate (which don&#x27;t take away frizz as well).</li>
            <li> I have noticed more hair than usual falling out</li>
            <li> I like that the consistency of this scent is much more fluid than some of the other wen scents.</li>
            <li> I could just refill a small bottle from a more bulk supply.</li>
            <li> You will throw away all your other hair products, shampoos and conditioners after trying it, so it&#x27;s worth every penny!  </li>
            <li> but it was even more &amp;#34;flat&#x27; than usual.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> Funny, I assumed canceling THREE times would be enough to have them get the</li>
            <li> Do not purchase because you will get a cheap imitation!</li>
            <li> I love it but is very expensive and I will no be able t continue use of this product to do expense</li>
            <li> I also definitely had to do clarifying washes with shampoos pretty frequently.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and have read so many good and bad responses, that I decided to ease into the amount of pumps I am trying.  </li>
            <li> but it can&#x27;t be a coincidence that so many people have the exact same complaint.  </li>
            <li> I am not making medical claims but it has certainly worked for me.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it my hair felt very soft and full bodied, but after a few uses you feel like you need to use regular shampoo,</li>
            <li> I was used to losing a good bit of hair, each time I washed (every other day), but in the last 3 weeks, it has come down to just 2 or 3 hairs, as opposed to about 20.  </li>
            <li> The Summer Mango Coconut scent is great during this cold weather.</li>
            <li> I HEARD IT WAS RETIRED CLEARLY</li>
            <li> , skin was nearly clear again, had just come across this article</li>
            <li> My hair has completely transformed.</li>
            <li> It did not feel soft and conditioned.  </li>
            <li> It did make my hair soft and shiny in the shower.</li>
            <li> The key here is to not over do it and go in gently.  </li>
            <li> It has really helped my longer hair, especially from midway to the ends.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair so soft.</li>
            <li> My hair has become so much softer since switching to this &amp;#34;shampoo&amp;#34; and only washing every 3 or 4 days.</li>
            <li> Use at least three pumps (more for thicker hair).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have lost so much hair and my hair looks gross and greasy-</li>
            <li> The smell is complete PERFECTION.</li>
            <li> Completely changed my hair.</li>
            <li> I able to detangle hair after I let it sit on for at least 15 mins.</li>
            <li> The bottle is far from ergonomic, either.</li>
            <li> one leaves my unruly hair soft &amp; silky.</li>
            <li> especially if you go to the gym and sweat alot your hair will be greasey no matter how much of the product you use.  </li>
            <li> (yes), makes hair soft (yes), does miracles (no).</li>
            <li> and I wish I had not wasted $32.00 on this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> If any of them posessed common sense they would know better</li>
            <li> Your hair should be saturated with the product and keep it on for the duration of the shower before cleansing completely.</li>
            <li> My weekend of fooling my nose into thinking I&#x27;m near the beach...</li>
            <li> my  legs  are  soft  </li>
            <li> Cleans hair, leaving soft, silky and bouncy.</li>
            <li> Pass the frozen coconut adult libations, please!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was really impressed as my hair dried because the soft, silky texture was something I had never experienced before!</li>
            <li> It is so soft and shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair was not frizzy and my natural curls were just like when I was a kid before I started dying and straightening my hair.</li>
            <li> I also am not using as much as the directions say, because I still have 1/4 bottle left, and it should all be gone by now.  </li>
            <li> I could actually see my layers, because my hair had so much movement.  </li>
            <li> It was as soft as my babies hair.  </li>
            <li> Smells divine, and keeps my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and this stuff is a dream for it.</li>
            <li> , some WEN&#x27; s have worked different on my hair, AND I never use as many pumps as they say it&#x27;s just a waste, use what u feel is needed with</li>
            <li> your palm put 1/2 the amount of shampoo you would normally use along with about the same amount you normally used for conditioner.</li>
            <li> Any Wen product is worth it, I will not ever go back to regular shampoo or conditioner.</li>
            <li> REALLY well, and that my friend will not happen again, unless you got the wrong kind for your hair.  </li>
            <li> I heard this product was kind of thin</li>
            <li> love how soft, shiny, thick, &amp; bouncy my hair looks...</li>
            <li> I have tried several of the other scents and for my chemistry and smell sensitivities, this is the ONLY one I love.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s harder to get the right amount out of the bottle having to squeeze it out</li>
            <li> I have very curly, dry, freezy hair and always looking to try new products.</li>
            <li> the other hand, it feels lovely when you put it on and smells great.&lt;br /&gt;However, certainly not one of my &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; products</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it everyday, but when I do it makes my hair soft and clean.</li>
            <li> The key is figuring out how much product to use, how much to scrub and lather, and how long to rinse.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not crazy about the other products you get in the Wen package (styling products and rewetting mist)</li>
            <li> She loves this product but she only washes her hair once or twice a week, at the most, washing that she used accomplish using an oil-wash followed by a deep conditioner which is oddly sort of how I would describe Wen, which she now uses for her once/twice a week hair routine, oily, sticky, deep-conditioning Wen.</li>
            <li> I am older, and my hair is colored, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to wash out like when I used regular shampoo.</li>
            <li> My hair feels and looks exactly the same as when I use my regular products.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t fond of the smell, and this particular WEN left my hair greasy.</li>
            <li> Also, I&#x27;m going to order L&#x27;oreal&#x27;s Evercreme cleansing conditioner because I read in its reviews that it does exactly the same thing for a third of the price.  </li>
            <li> because it doesn&#x27;t feel as clean to me; with that said I will use it occasionally as the only product to \\&quot;wash\\&quot; my hair, but I use it daily as a conditioner which helps because I have super thick/coarse hair and this product helps to tame my locks without leaving residue on my hair.</li>
            <li> (mine is medium in thickness, medium brown, and growing out of a pale white British scalp and hers is lush, thick, beautiful, spiral curling African American hair that is very dry and needs a lot of oil to keep from becoming brittle).</li>
            <li> I am stoked to use something new, in the fall I would go back to our old favorites though.</li>
            <li> and I love what they do for my hair, but, the smell was not good.  </li>
            <li> I usually order from QVC, but since this isn&#x27;t available in the winter i decided to give amazon a try.</li>
            <li> Actually,  I would love them to sell it year round in the larger size.</li>
            <li> The bottle is a different size than normal and it did not come with a pump head.  </li>
            <li> I have actually gone well over a week before with zero shampoo - only getting my hair wet and &amp;#34;washing&amp;#34; with a cheap conditioner like Suave - and at the end of the week I barely had any oils my hair.  </li>
            <li> and it smelled lovely, but I&#x27;d rather have my hair feel clean and soft not dirty, coarse, and heavy, though it didn&#x27;t look dirty.</li>
            <li> Love the smell been ordering Wen on auto delivery for about 2-yrs straight now through Guthy Renker 2as sometimes getting the wrong order</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and have issues with shampoos making my scalp itchy and red.</li>
            <li> Only problem is I don&#x27;t think I want that scent year round and wish it didn&#x27;t cost so much!!!  </li>
            <li> I mean if you think your hair is rinsed, go back in and rinse it some more.  </li>
            <li> My hair was brittle and majorly damaged from repeated dying and bleaching.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey, but worth it.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a little pricy but worth the cost.</li>
            <li> The product seems to be a bit too heavy and by the second day I feel it&#x27;s time the wash again in ordert feel clean.</li>
            <li> Due to severe Trichotillomania as a child, my hair grew back in several different textures ranging from extremely kinky to fine and straight.  </li>
            <li> It was much stronger than expected.</li>
            <li> This product is fake!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;After going to the WEN web site and participating dealers to find the &amp;#34;mango coconut&amp;#34; scent, I found out that this product was a fake and further more, when compared to a real WEN product the evidence is proof!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> product must be several years old.</li>
            <li> They all make my hair sooooo soft and healhy looking.&lt;br /&gt;I will not be purchasing this specific scent again though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve Ben using WEN for years now and my hair as never been healthier or prettier - except when I was younger and didn&#x27;t have stubborn grays or frequent coloring to hide said grays.  </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m naturally a brunette who was meant to be a blonde).</li>
            <li> My wife wanted to return this sub-par product which did the complete opposite of what they claimed...</li>
            <li> , it wasn&#x27;t until last night that I realized that my mothers use of Wen and my use of Wen started approximately the same time and during this time period both of our heads went from beautiful heads of hair to, sparse limp damaged hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair looks thick and smooth.</li>
            <li> My hair had more sheen and no fly away</li>
            <li> I highly recommend for dry hair.</li>
            <li> After getting out of the shower by hair would be so dry and thirsty for moisture it would get frizzy in any kind of humidity (not good in Western Washington weather).</li>
            <li> I have tried almost all of the other types of the WEN cleansing conditioners, &amp;#34;Summer Mango Coconut&amp;#34; is my all time favorite, I use it all year round!</li>
            <li> You can buy here on Amazon for a decent cost and will last for a long while.</li>
            <li> /&gt;just called Wen by Chaz Dean and because I order in large quantities every 3 months, there policy is they&#x27;ll buy back products (including empty bottles)</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really like the auto-ship every month though, and don&#x27;t use the other products, just the cleansing conditioner.  </li>
            <li> it also moisturizes extremely well and cleanses very well</li>
            <li> Lavendar and Gardenia Green Tea make my hair a little more bouncy.</li>
            <li> It did help tremendously with my dry ends, and it doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down.  </li>
            <li> I will still wash the top half of my head in the sink every other day; don&#x27;t want to dry out the ends by washing it too often.</li>
            <li> WEN makes my hair soft and manageable even on African American hair.</li>
            <li> I have surly hair that is never dry because of Wen.</li>
            <li> We usually use the basic Sweet Almond Mint</li>
            <li> My hair is very soft and no longer feels dry.  </li>
            <li> Plus, if you actually used the exact amount of pumps they advise, you&#x27;d use up the 16oz bottle in less than 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After calling back again and waiting an hour again to speak to a live individual I was finally informed by a \\&quot;supervisor\\&quot; the account would finally be canceled and I would receive my refund.</li>
            <li> A female African American friend insisted I try this, in spite of the marked difference in our hair</li>
            <li> Have to use six pumps to do my hair, which is not long.  </li>
            <li> and I barely had to do any extra styling.  </li>
            <li> My hair felt heavy and looked greasy after the first use.</li>
            <li> This Mango Coconut leaves my hair full &amp; thick</li>
            <li> So I decided to purchase 2 more bottles unfortunally the 2nd purchase of this product left my hair very oily and dirty looking.</li>
            <li> - they make my hair feel soft and manageable (and I have long, curly, frizzy hair!)</li>
            <li> People that have fine or thin hair seem to say it just makes their hair greasy.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for so much and got so little.</li>
            <li> so i did not use too much or too little</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and usually just falls flat when I blow dry it, so I had to use mousse or gels which make my hair feel strange.</li>
            <li> This is one of those rare instances where ethnic background does, unfortunately rule out certain people as clients of a company.</li>
            <li> I do have thin, fine hair that&#x27;s naturally blonde but currently a 3RB color.</li>
            <li> I have thick, slightly wavy, treated hair, and my hair didn&#x27;t feel clean nor soft.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised it was so bad due to the good reviews</li>
            <li> It is also extremely time consuming, so if you&#x27;re busy and time crunched as it is, this is definitely not the product for you!</li>
            <li> I had to use so much of this stuff to get my hair to feel clean, it was crazy.</li>
            <li> Also I&#x27;ve noticed my hair styles last longer and doesn&#x27;t go flat like before when i was using shampoos.</li>
            <li> it makes my hair soft and shinny and full of body &amp; knowing that I&#x27;m not putting nasty things in my hair makes it even better...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know yet how long it will last, but with only 2 pumps for each use, I should get lots of shampooing out of one container.</li>
            <li> Long story short, I removed the lid, squeezed out a big glob, and started massaging!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I rinsed, jumped out, towel dried, and it definitely seemed curlier than normal.  </li>
            <li> No volume, no luminescence, just flat, limp, and heavy like it was full of goop.</li>
            <li> my hair is fine, wavy/light curl, very little process, just gets a little dry on the ends at times.  </li>
            <li> This is more expensive than regular shampoo and conditioner, I will end up spending about the same amount per year using just Wen because I won&#x27;t be continuously buying shampoo and conditioner, leave-in conditioner, anti-frizz serums, and other various hair products.</li>
            <li> my hair the same but left my scalp realky dry</li>
            <li> I used to flat iron my hair every day.</li>
            <li> If you look at all the people in the commercial they have long hair.</li>
            <li> All it did was make my hair greasy and flat.  </li>
            <li> I have long frizzy curly/wavy psycho red color treated hair.</li>
            <li> I think the people who claim to have greasy hair, are not scrubbing or rinsing long enough.  </li>
            <li> It did make my hair soft, but it also weighed down my hair.</li>
            <li> Apparently not!</li>
            <li> Too expensive for what it does and my hair gets greasy easily.</li>
            <li> I was never able to grow my hair as long before as I am now, my hair is MUCH stronger now and is thicker than it has been since it&#x27;s no longer breaking as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I found if I didn&#x27;t, I had greasy looking hair which only needed some dry shampoo to fix</li>
            <li> I normally do not style my hair, sometimes not even blow drying it, so is that why I won&#x27;t see the same results?  </li>
            <li> so I like it but due to price, likely my last bottle</li>
            <li> I have thin hair and am proof that Wen does indeed calm the frizz from drying.  </li>
            <li> I had a residue left, and I spent a lot of time trying to wash out the product.  </li>
            <li> And I am a long time WEN user.</li>
            <li> It says for long hair 24-32 pumps for long hair.</li>
            <li> It makes me long for beaches and maxi dresses.  </li>
            <li> You use A LOT of this product (my hair is down to mid back)</li>
            <li> I have hair down to the middle of my back</li>
            <li> Anything new to the bod takes time, when it comes to the hair at least three months to fully adjust to a different product.</li>
            <li> Now, after I wash my hair with Wen and blow dry it, and it holds all day long.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Friends don&#x27;t let other friends use shampoo&amp;#34;, defenseless because it&#x27;s so true.</li>
            <li> 16oz bottle last 2 weeks using every other day.</li>
            <li> and I will be using Wen for a long time to come!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s different from any other hair product I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> Not natural!</li>
            <li> Other than that, take the risk yourself if you want your hair falling out in giant clumps!</li>
            <li> I reviewed several other reviews on this product before I bought it.</li>
            <li> Scent of summer after this long winter!  </li>
            <li> I think rinsing extremely well is key with these cleansing conditioners.  </li>
            <li> If you do not like their other scents, then definitely order this one!</li>
            <li> Wen works well on hair that is damaged or on the dry side.</li>
            <li> I use it as directed and rinse thoroughly, but every time in dry or straighten my hair, it gets stringy and greasy.</li>
            <li> This product made my hair immediately greasy and dry</li>
            <li> TRYING TO UNTANGLE OR COMB THROUGH IT WHEN DRY.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally dry and my scalp is by no streatch of the imagination oily.</li>
            <li> my hair is also dyed so it becomes dry ...</li>
            <li> but I do not have any spit ends or dry hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also got my mom to use it because she was having problems with dry scalp and hair lose</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for my dry, curly hair....</li>
            <li> ,THEN RENSE AND COMB THROUGH CAREFULLY WITH BIG WIDE TOOTHED COMB.PROVIDED WITH</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few other Wen cleansers and this is by far my favourite!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used high-end salon products or expensive natural products purchased at Whole Foods etc.&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> Highly recommend trying at least.</li>
            <li> I blew it dry with a large round brush like I always do when I wear it down, except this time I needed a lot less product</li>
            <li> I plan to look for other phosphate free shampoos since Wen is just too expensive.</li>
            <li> My hair usually frizzes after washing it and even after straightening it but after using Wen it has completely tamed my hair.</li>
            <li> but I loose a lot of hair after I use it.</li>
            <li> I normally loose in the shower.</li>
            <li> believe &amp;#34;my formula&amp;#34; will be 18 pumps per rinse (splitting my hair down the middle - 9 pumps on each side)..  </li>
            <li> It weighed down my hair and made it impossibly gritty feeling.</li>
            <li> and the last time I wore it down, I looked like a scarecrow.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually laying down in bed typing this, and it feels like I&#x27;m laying on a satin pillow case</li>
            <li> But if you have short hair, you could use less than what is recommended.</li>
            <li> OMG this is just your typical conditioner, didn&#x27;t do anything like the commercial...</li>
            <li> but for my daughter&#x27;s hair that tangles - it is the only thing I can use (mix half part water/half part wen) - put in a spray bottle - to get those tangles out.  </li>
            <li> , that doesn&#x27;t make sense to use creamy conditioner twice to get my hair less oily unless it was the cleanser I was benefiting from, not the extra</li>
            <li> I get oil scalp but very dry ends</li>
            <li> I have colored, permed and thus very dry hair.</li>
            <li> I have very thick red hair and am very sensitive to products.</li>
            <li> Also, on TV it appears that the before / after model hair comparison is with the regular shampoo non styled vs the Wen cleansing conditioner styled and if so that is not a true comparison.  </li>
            <li> red blotchy blistery mess,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not to thick, not to thin, but the strands are baby fine, and they tangle.  </li>
            <li> I was a little nervous that this version would be heavily scented and have been pleasantly surprised ....</li>
            <li> but THE TRICK is to wash any conditioner you use at least two inches away from the scalp and it prevents it from getting ready for a couple little longer than if you washed the roots.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m never going back to ANY OTHER SHAMPOO EVER AGAIN !!</li>
            <li> I have already made a complaint direct to Amazon.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that my hair often looks greasy, especially my bangs.  </li>
            <li> Felt almost rough and sticky.  </li>
            <li> I feel like I need to use proper harsh shampoos to break the oiliness in my hair.</li>
            <li> I have thin hair and wash it very 2 days.</li>
            <li> I BELIEVE THAT SUMMER MANGO( WHEN CAREFULLY USED) GROWS AND THICKENS YOUR HAIR</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried it a few times now and same results.</li>
            <li> There was absolutely no coconut smell  to it at all</li>
            <li> Left my hair feeling limp and oily.</li>
            <li> Left my hair greasy and limp.</li>
            <li> I waited for days, impatiently, and finally got the package.  </li>
            <li> I just ordered the kids Wen and am curious to see how that will work for her!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s cumbersome to hold while your hands are wet.</li>
            <li> and I was curious but scared to try it because if you leave it to what the tv says every product works</li>
            <li> it smells great,but if you have really thick and naturally oily hair</li>
            <li> I have thick, damaged, african american hair.  </li>
            <li> I have tried everything from very expensive to really cheap for my reddish, curly, color-treated hair with limited results.</li>
            <li> can only believe that from the time of just a few treatments lots of hair loss occured due to the product.  </li>
            <li> So if you want your hair to be weighed down after using it for long periods of time WITHOUT using any other type of shampoo or conditioner, then this is for you.  </li>
            <li> I have long, red thick curly hair.</li>
            <li> I am blonde and always dye my hair dark but it always faded ...not with WEN !!</li>
            <li> I developed dry scalp in the winter making it worse.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews about Wen products on this and other websites, and then I went to the wen.com website and looked under &amp;#34;how to use&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> We use this on her hair every other day.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll try to wash my hair every other day...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need any other products.</li>
            <li> After two weeks of using it every other day, I had to give up.</li>
            <li> See my other WEN product review for specifics</li>
            <li> I usually try to mix it with cheaper cleansing conditioner so it will last longer.</li>
            <li> past week I ordered Wen as a last resort before chopping all my hair off.  </li>
            <li> now, I have no plans on using heat or other products on my hair.  </li>
            <li> I am already planning on giving away my other hair</li>
            <li> Other than that, it works just as well as all other Wen cleansing conditioners.</li>
            <li> Every other treatment I leave on for 60 minutes.</li>
            <li> The other times I leave on for about 10</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have any of the menthol feel or scent of the other Wen products I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> I have oily hair and have to wash daily but a bottle still lasts me over a month and my hair is well past my shoulders.</li>
            <li> I was so skeptical at first of this product.  </li>
            <li> have used this product for 3 weeks, every other day, and I think I&#x27;m gonna keep ordering.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t care for any of the other kinds.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, curly &amp; long hair &amp; was finding that WEN was not lasting very long at all.</li>
            <li> This is for those of us with extremely dry hair who need a little weight in our locks.  </li>
            <li> but I still have to condition a few times a week because I have dry and treated hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been having trouble with dry scalp during the winter months.</li>
            <li> thank you for this article, as for the past year and half plus, I have been breaking out with massive contact dermatitis around my nose and mouth, couldn&#x27;t figure out what was causing it...</li>
            <li> But the price balances itself out since I will have less salon visits and stop using a bunch of other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now I used somewhat less for washing and much less (only one small pump) for leave-in conditioner.</li>
            <li> The other reviews that say, \\&quot;it will ruin your hair\\&quot;,  that is a little extreme</li>
            <li> It is beyond expensive.&lt;br /&gt;I would not reommend it not worth the price.</li>
            <li> The only complaint is the price, it&#x27;s a bit steep for just 16 oz.</li>
            <li> So not worth the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not talking a few small clumps, I&#x27;m talking about a clump the size of several cotton</li>
            <li> My only complaint is this did not come with a pump, as shown in the pic</li>
            <li> I know, not a fun combo.</li>
            <li> My preteen has thick hair that takes a beating in humid weather or sweaty physical education in school.</li>
            <li> I have coarse, thick hair.</li>
            <li> Then slowly move towards the ends before moving to the next section.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair is elbow length, medium thick, wavy, white girl hair.  </li>
            <li> and I did receive a partial refund for the missing pump.</li>
            <li> theory behind this product is that it is not magic, it just uses much less shampoo (guess we are all using too much shampoo)</li>
            <li> He has thick black hair cut short and this product makes his hair shine like krazy.</li>
            <li> I found this product, after using it for 7 days, to weigh my hair down a bit.  </li>
            <li> I still get a smoother look without my hair feeling weighed down or too greasy.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wear it down.</li>
            <li> it weighs it down....</li>
            <li> Just weighed my hair down</li>
            <li> This scent doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down or make it feel greasy.</li>
            <li> It is stuck completely down.</li>
            <li> It kinda weighs down my this hair</li>
            <li> I was going to wear it down today despite the wind and</li>
            <li> Some reviewers also stated that the product leaves a residue and leaves the hair weighed down.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t rinse and repeat though because I read it might weigh down your hair.</li>
            <li> My wife has very curly hair, and she loves this product, she only wishes she could buy it in gallons, instead of these little bottles that a very expensive</li>
            <li> Did not make the ends of my hair any less brittle or frizzy.</li>
            <li> Typical Caucasian hair.</li>
            <li> I typically have oily hair, but not with this product.</li>
            <li> use less pumps to coat/wash my hair then</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s absurd, especially if you can do the same thing at home.</li>
            <li> I did not even use half that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> - dont get me wrong, but I&#x27;m learning that the different fragrances do provide a different result in my hair.  </li>
            <li> I have volume, and it&#x27;s less tangly.  </li>
            <li> half way nourished</li>
            <li> , I know they&#x27;re lying to me like they lied to me the previous three times</li>
            <li> She is a mixed breed and it&#x27;s hard to tame her hair.  </li>
            <li> If you use a small amount of a clarifying/no build-up shampoo everyday and then follow up with a small amount of Wen as a conditioner, it works well but no better than any decent conditioner you could purchase after a small amount of research.</li>
            <li> This product did not wow me in the least.</li>
            <li> This seemed like a waste for such an expensive product, so I have just stuck to the 12 total pumps.  </li>
            <li> After it came I used it a few times with greasy, weighed down hair as a result.</li>
            <li> To my surprise it was a little harder to comb out than it usually is with my conditioner in.  </li>
            <li> I was curious about it for years after seeing women swear by it in commercials, but it&#x27;s just an average thick cream conditioner.</li>
            <li> A little heavy for my hair, so I use less than recommended.  </li>
            <li> As a cleanser, it is not effective and, because of the buildup it leaves even after ten minutes of rinsing, it weighs hair down and makes it look dull and lifeless.</li>
            <li> For the past 2 years that i have been using this i have not needed to use other shampoos.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it would work for someone with extremely oily hair, I do tend towards an oily scalp and this formula cleans my hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a year, both me and my mother started using wen a little over a year ago.</li>
            <li> I rinse and add a little as a leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li> The summer edition is not my favourite because it doesn&#x27;t make my scalp tingle and the scent is a little too overwhealming for me.</li>
            <li> It was a little while before I realized what was causing the rash</li>
            <li> No split ends and little breakage.  </li>
            <li> I was a little worried that it wasn&#x27;t going to do the trick.&lt;br</li>
            <li> a product that doesn&#x27;t let you down !  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is its not effective at cleaning my scalp.</li>
            <li> Third day, reduced the pumps yet again, washed and rinsed hair in cold water and the same thing.</li>
            <li> The alcohols dried my already damaged hair.</li>
            <li> My hair was dead and had no shine or bounce to it.</li>
            <li> I also like the green tea and lavender scents.</li>
            <li> this is way too heavy for someone with thin/fine hair.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s too heavy..</li>
            <li> it leaves my hair dead and lifeless....</li>
            <li> I wasted 30.00 on this,non refundable</li>
            <li> I purchased this after a few years of watching the infomercials and reading TONS of reviews.</li>
            <li> Only bummer is Wen makes my dandruff worse</li>
            <li> , the ends of my hair looked so lifeless and dead, this product turned it around.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use Wen everyday because of the build up, but every few days it does wonders for my hair.</li>
            <li> We dont use it year round as we cant always afford it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this a few times now</li>
            <li> and I totally understand the hype behind this product.</li>
            <li> I tried this after seeing an info-mercial a few years ago and have used it ever since.</li>
            <li> we are both in separate households within the past year my mother&#x27;s hair and my hair has dwindle down to almost nothing.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of Wen for years, but wish the piece was a bit less!</li>
            <li> but they pale in comparison for cleaning, shine and manageability.  </li>
            <li> For years I&#x27;ve always been complemented on my thick long hair lately</li>
            <li> I think this product was extremely old such as expired it was almost dried out and was very disappointing to wash my hair</li>
            <li> I have long, thin hair</li>
            <li> / up for the past few weeks</li>
            <li> I was worried it would weigh my hair down as I have really thick hair that gets oily after one day.</li>
            <li> The Almond is for all hair types - Fig is for dry damaged, the Lavender for thin, oily etc.  </li>
            <li> It was also barely past my ears in length.</li>
            <li> and yes this product is expensive but imagine having to buy different shampoos every week including dandruff  to control everything.</li>
            <li> Remember, too, to use a small amount of it after you have cleansed and rinsed to rub between your hands and apply to the mid-to end of hair and leave it in.</li>
            <li> but I have no better way to say this</li>
            <li> Others, especially with the mango coconut variety fulfilled by random sellers did not fare as well.</li>
            <li> or if it&#x27;s just way past</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it is this scent that is causing this to happen.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it now for the past two years.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is a knock off or not.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if it was made for my hair type.</li>
            <li> I did check the pricing and I pay no more on Amazon and with Prime</li>
            <li> Yes, Christmas has come and past and all I wanted for Christmas was Summer Mango Coconut WEN.  </li>
            <li> Used it once so not sure how results will be</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to lie, I am not sure what all the hype is about this stuff.</li>
            <li> A bit small.</li>
            <li> I used Wen on Wednesday of this week but felt forced to wear it up / curly that morning anyway due to the ridiculous weather in Chicago.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive to begin with, and one of my few luxuries on a limited budget.</li>
            <li> This sounded like an awful lot especially for a very pricey product.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that I think it is too expensive.</li>
            <li> I only used it a handful of times but every single time I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have one complaint and that is the small quantity.</li>
            <li> Girl&amp;#34; for a few years now and the seasonal fragrances can be hard to come by sometimes!  </li>
            <li> i have long very thin hair and color treated:&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am a die hard WEN fan.</li>
            <li> Hard to find.</li>
            <li> and I work hard and deserve it.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s little thin</li>
            <li> I hope they keep at least one of the fruity ones around all the time.  </li>
            <li> However, at least she got to experience it and found out for herself.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of different Wen products and this one by far smells the worst.</li>
            <li> so i&#x27;m using the least amount recommended.</li>
            <li> use this when repairing thick damaged hair.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed, but not surpised as I rarely fall for gimicky informercial products!</li>
            <li> My hair is thick, to mid-back and colored.</li>
            <li> I am 54 w graying, textured, curly thick hair and the WEN products</li>
            <li> I live in the desert with horrible crappy water that is not soft.</li>
            <li> Use no more than a quarter size amount in your hand and it works wonders!</li>
            <li> No more frizzies!</li>
            <li> photos are unbelievable!</li>
            <li> Not worth the expensive price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The product was a very small bottle.  </li>
            <li> The bottle is smaller that you might imagine, so this very expensive.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s subtle, yet you can smell it when you turn your head.  </li>
            <li> but my hair felt a little weird, both with and without using a sulfite-free shampoo,</li>
            <li> I probably got the wrong scent to - Mango Coconut - as it was a little overpowering for me.  </li>
            <li> Not a good thing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry for how stark this comment will be</li>
            <li> after reading this article, I double checked my products I use and was SHOCKED when I read the labels on my Wen hair care products...</li>
            <li> oooohhhh not a wise move Chaz Dean corporation....</li>
            <li> Way over priced and not good for wavy hair.</li>
            <li> Too expensive but would have been a waste to return.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say a single bad thing about to product.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, wavy, and frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> No more fern head, I&#x27;m in hair heaven!!.</li>
            <li> Sorry just a little skeptical.</li>
            <li> Soy was an unnecessary ingredient.</li>
            <li> Hair felt heavy and dirty</li>
            <li> No way is this for thin hair...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been struggling to part it, as to not show the thin spots.  </li>
            <li> (I have thin hair) yet not frizzy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted to this stuff.</li>
            <li> For those of us with tangle messes, you know how frustrating it can be.  </li>
            <li> The seal must be broken to inset the pump.</li>
            <li> I have thin wavy hair that I dye every 6 to 8 weeks</li>
            <li> , even worse customer service, it&#x27;s basically a scam.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a shame that the company behind the product has set a prohibitively expensive price tag on its products.  </li>
            <li> So I Have Thick Crazy Hair ,,, I Been Using WEN for a month .</li>
            <li> LIKE SUMMER YEAR ROUND!!!!</li>
            <li> Expensive.  </li>
            <li> I followed the directions to a T and was not impressed for the amount.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive, but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> but it comes with a lousy pump dispenser.</li>
            <li> Sorry - not for us</li>
            <li> Too expensive to throw out</li>
            <li> but I was so wrong.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s an expensive shampoo</li>
            <li> Something is wrong with this product, I realize you can&#x27;t please everyone</li>
            <li> I had tried another WEN product before this scent and was not impressed.  </li>
            <li> sorry</li>
            <li> Too expensive on WEN web site</li>
            <li> I am not impressed.  </li>
            <li> I have been using WEN for 7+ years, it is expensive</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s too expensive.</li>
            <li> There was nothing wrong with the performance of the product</li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t like this product not what its all cracked up tp be and over priced for what its supposed to do made my hair dryer was not impressed at all</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about Wen.</li>
            <li> It is expensive, even on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Way too expensive</li>
            <li> Silly me.  </li>
            <li> IF your hair is oily after using WEN, you&#x27;ve used it wrong.  </li>
            <li> I jumped into the shower, popped the pump up, pump pump pump... and fail.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Moral of the story - Useless product</li>
            <li> However, I was very disappointed to find this on QVC for 10 dollars less than here, after I bought it.  </li>
            <li> Not to mention the horrible buildup it leaves on your locks, it will just weigh down your hair.</li>
            <li> Disappointing.</li>
            <li> I am in a pool for hours a day and my hair w shampoo was course, brittle and plain nasty.</li>
            <li> Wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive though!  </li>
            <li> It was a fake!</li>
            <li> I have very difficult hair -</li>
            <li> It was not too bad for one day</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t listen to bad reviews about Wen.</li>
            <li> My hair used to get really bad in the winter</li>
            <li> I felt sick to my stomacher when I googled Wen Hair Loss and found page after page and blog after blog about women losing their hair after using Wen.  </li>
            <li> So disappointed with the product.</li>
            <li> Disappointed it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> SO disappointed.</li>
            <li> However, I was EXTREMELY disappointed in the product for myself.</li>
            <li> am EXTREMELY disappointed in Amazon for allowing this.</li>
            <li> /&gt;article link:  [...]&lt;</li>
            <li> My hair is to my waist &amp; it has been thinning :( ...</li>
            <li> I wash my hair :(  </li>
            <li> , I hate to break it to you, it is loaded with soy.</li>
            <li> hate it</li>
            <li> Very unpleasant to use as it is slimy.  </li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;ve always HATED their scents.</li>
            <li> Disappointed!</li>
            <li> This product is terrible!!!</li>
            <li> this is horrible for me!  </li>
            <li> Worst product ever!</li>
            <li> I find this extremely disgusting and unhygienic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been watching those Wen commercials for years and always thought it was outrageously priced but still wanted to try it.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Does not do all it claims, but, the lack of phosphates keeps my hair from falling out. I plan to look for other phosphate free shampoos since Wen is just too expensive. I do not believe it is worth as much as they charge for it.</li>
            <li> Expensive.  Found an equivalent at Sally Beauty Supply called Hair One that is just as good and more affordable.</li>
            <li> These scent is ok but it&#x27;s little thin I like the fig,fall ginger pumpkin and the six thirteen the best</li>
            <li> Summer Mango Coconut is nice and smells good, but the scent is not as strongs as the others. If you&#x27;re ok with that, then go with this product, but I like it to be a little stronger. I&#x27;ve always loved Sweet Almond Mint and I like my hair to smell good for hours.</li>
            <li> Great product. Have enjoyed it so much.  Fast shipment also. Such a wonderful company to work with.  Thanks so much. Very costly though.  I am growing out chemo hair..... curly and frizzy - wasn&#x27;t like that before.</li>
            <li> the mango/coconut works best for me.</li>
            <li> Too expensive for what it does and my hair gets greasy easily. I followed the directions to a T and was not impressed for the amount. i might pay 10$ for this shampoo but definitely not 40 plus again.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful and it makes my hair shine :)</li>
            <li> Arrived before  shipping date. Thank you was totally  out.</li>
            <li> My farorite love this scent and works great!</li>
            <li> I love anything WEN. I have written many reviews on WEN, and nothing has changed; This is a fantastic cleansing conditioner. If anyone has direct questions, please feel free to ask me; I have been using WEN for 5 years.</li>
            <li> Received item as described, fast delivery, nice packaging. Would not hesitate to purchase again!</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this mango coconut cleansing conditioner.  Wen works well on hair that is damaged or on the dry side.</li>
            <li> Wen products are the best! Summer mango smells good and still leaves my hair great!</li>
            <li> Love it. Wish it was cheaper!</li>
            <li> I have very thick red hair and am very sensitive to products. I absolutely love this product! The smell is amazing and uplifting. My hair looks great and is so soft without any frizz. Not all hair responds the same so not all products will work you need to try it for yourself to see if it works for you. The Wen line is amazing!!</li>
            <li> favorite one out of all the wens. this one i feel is more moisturizing :)</li>
            <li> The alcohols dried my already damaged hair. I was surprised it was so bad due to the good reviews but it was. I returned it and Amazon was very quick with a refund.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for so much and got so little.</li>
            <li> We love wen just wish they made a shampoo.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews about Wen products on this and other websites, and then I went to the wen.com website and looked under &amp;#34;how to use&amp;#34;. It stated that for short hair you should use 10-16 pumps. This sounded like an awful lot especially for a very pricey product. My hair just covers my ears, so it&#x27;s short, but not close-cropped. I tried using 2 steady pumps (about one teaspoon) and then rubbed it into my hair and added some water. It worked just fine, and my hair handled very well after I dried it. My hair is fine and usually just falls flat when I blow dry it, so I had to use mousse or gels which make my hair feel strange. Now, after I wash my hair with Wen and blow dry it, and it holds all day long. I don&#x27;t know yet how long it will last, but with only 2 pumps for each use, I should get lots of shampooing out of one container.</li>
            <li> I am a die hard WEN fan. My hair has completely transformed. I used to flat iron my hair every day. My hair was dead and had no shine or bounce to it. It was also barely past my ears in length. I have been using this product for two years and my hair is completely healthy and back to it&#x27;s natural beautiful curl that I get so many complements on. It&#x27;s expensive, but you get what you pay for. Healthy hair has many effects on your every day life so you want to make sure you give it the care it needs. The Summer Mango Coconut is by far my favorite scent. I also really love the fig because my hair is colored and it makes the color shine and last longer.</li>
            <li> Smells like summertime!</li>
            <li> use this when repairing thick damaged hair. My preteen has thick hair that takes a beating in humid weather or sweaty physical education in school. We use this on her hair every other day. Use no more than a quarter size amount in your hand and it works wonders! This is our second bottle.</li>
            <li> I love all Wen, but the Summer Mango Coconut smells amazing! Prompt shipping was nice also.</li>
            <li> My husband loves Chaz Dean&#x27;s product and he never heads for his shower to wash his hair, unless he has his Summer Mangoo Coconut Cleansing Conditioner.</li>
            <li> Looooovve the scent!!!</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t feel the menthol.</li>
            <li> I HEARD IT WAS RETIRED CLEARLY NOT IF MY WONDERFUL AMAZON HAS IT, ONE OF THE FEW WEN PRODUCTS THAT ACTUALLY SMELLS GOOD</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always done my daughters hair. She is a mixed breed and it&#x27;s hard to tame her hair.  She left for college and I panicked. I purchased Wen and her hair looks healthier and she can do it in one application.  She still calls me from college, but its not about hair, it&#x27;s about the bathroom.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite WEN fragrances. I love how my hair is after changing to the WEN products. I will never go back to regular shampoos.</li>
            <li> Wen is the only shampoo my family uses!</li>
            <li> I found this product, after using it for 7 days, to weigh my hair down a bit.  It did not feel soft and conditioned.  Felt almost rough and sticky.  Will not return, but will not reorder either.</li>
            <li> I had read a lot about this product and have also seen the infomercials so I was interested in trying it. I was glad to find a single bottle on Amazon instead of signing up for monthly delivery, etc that their direct website requires.  It takes a bit to get used to the &amp;#34;no bubbles&amp;#34; aspect of this shampoo. It just feels like you are using conditioner.  However, my hair does feel silkier and styles better using this product. I have very fine hair that is just past shoulder length. Because my hair is so fine, I really don&#x27;t need as much product as the directions give.  I usually only use 3 full pumps which is plenty.  The mango coconut scent is nice but a little too sweet smelling.  I might try a different scent next time.</li>
            <li> I love my WEN shampoo/conditioner...one step to beautiful, soft hair!  And, the summer mango coconut smells like I&#x27;m at the BEACH!!!</li>
            <li> Outstanding product. For years i had to use different shampoos because whatever i used made my scalp itch. I developed dry scalp in the winter making it worse. I always had to use Dandruff shampoo to counteract the itchiness, it was just embarrassing. For the past 2 years that i have been using this i have not needed to use other shampoos. I am not making medical claims but it has certainly worked for me. I am guy with short hair so i don&#x27;t have to  use as much as the product states and yes this product is expensive but imagine having to buy different shampoos every week including dandruff  to control everything. A bottle for me lasts 5 months since i don&#x27;t need to wash my hair as much as i needed to before. I now do it twice a week and my hair is always shiny and clean. I get different scents and have been happy.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite Wen scents! The coconut smell stands out (but not too strong) and it leaves my hair smelling great all day. Smells like a pina colada...smells like summer!</li>
            <li> This is one amazing product</li>
            <li> Love the way it smells but my hair felt a little weird, both with and without using a sulfite-free shampoo,</li>
            <li> Went through product to fast. Can&#x27;t afford it. It did make my hair soft and shiny in the shower. Did not make the ends of my hair any less brittle or frizzy. Disappointed!</li>
            <li> I did quite a bit of research before purchasing the Wen. I guess I wasn&#x27;t thrilled with the outcome of the product because I don&#x27;t use it enough to see if it works over time.  It&#x27;s a good moisturizer but I feel like I need to use more product than recommended to get any lasting results and for the price I can use another conditioner.</li>
            <li> Love the cleanser but it comes with a lousy pump dispenser.</li>
            <li> I gave this product 4 stars because I am still in the trial weeks of using this product.  I have long hair and have read so many good and bad responses, that I decided to ease into the amount of pumps I am trying.  I started with 8 pumps, rinsed and 8 pumps again as directed on the bottle.  The feel was not greasy at all, but I knew I could go ahead and up the pumps.  Today, I am up to 16 pumps, rinsing and then another 16 pumps.  My hair is feeling softer and smoother already.&lt;br /&gt;I believe &amp;#34;my formula&amp;#34; will be 18 pumps per rinse (splitting my hair down the middle - 9 pumps on each side)..  The key here is to not over do it and go in gently.  See what works for your hair type.  This is a great product - if used properly.</li>
            <li> Smell heavenly....great moisturizer for the hair and scalp.</li>
            <li> This Wen shampoo smells so good! Fast shipment</li>
            <li> My favorite Wen fragrance yet besides lavender. Mango is very refreshing. One word of caution for those with estrogen dominance, or an allergy to soy, I hate to break it to you, it is loaded with soy. Not a good thing. I only give it a 4 star because of this fact. Soy was an unnecessary ingredient. It would have been perfect otherwise.</li>
            <li> The mango coconut smell is nice. However, I have to use A TON to saturate my hair, and it leaves a greasy feeling at the roots. but I do like how it makes my hair look when I style it. Wish it wasn&#x27;t so pricey.</li>
            <li> I have used it for about 1 month.  My hair has improved, but it did not happen after the first or second applicaton.  my hair is fine, wavy/light curl, very little process, just gets a little dry on the ends at times.  (so my hair is not damaged).&lt;br /&gt;Wen is good, but doesn&#x27;t work overnight.  I do plan to try another scent.  I bought the Coconut Mango, and they said on TV they may not bring it back next year.  I will try the kids apple next.  I hope they keep at least one of the fruity ones around all the time.  or i won&#x27;t buy it anymore.</li>
            <li> I would recommend WEN to anyone with longer hair. It has really helped my longer hair, especially from midway to the ends. It&#x27;s not as fuzzy, and the bottom of my hair is much fuller and not straggly any more. I just love this scent!  Wish it was available all year long! If you have not used WEN before, you need to get used to it! There is no &amp;#34;sudsing action&amp;#34;, and you may feel like your hair isn&#x27;t really clean at first. It took me a while, too, to get used to it. I will still wash the top half of my head in the sink every other day; don&#x27;t want to dry out the ends by washing it too often. I am older, and my hair is colored, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to wash out like when I used regular shampoo. Remember, too, to use a small amount of it after you have cleansed and rinsed to rub between your hands and apply to the mid-to end of hair and leave it in.</li>
            <li> Product shipped on time and works GREAT</li>
            <li> In my opinion this is the best of the Wen scents offered!  I know it was a &#x27;summer scent&#x27; but I hope that they bring it back again every summer!  Something about it just is soothing - making me think of beaches and pina colodas!</li>
            <li> this product is becoming too pricey for the performance so I like it but due to price, likely my last bottle</li>
            <li> Get&#x27;s me quite the Itch on my Scalp. Even my Wife complains about it. Sorry - not for us</li>
            <li> I really thought this product would work for both a shampoo and conditioner (to save time and $$) but I still have to condition a few times a week because I have dry and treated hair. Good shampoo though and it smells delicious...</li>
            <li> I have very curly, dry, freezy hair and always looking to try new products. I read the reviews and decided to try it, bought the Summer Mango Coconut conditioner. I used it as directed for several weeks and I also used it as a leave-in conditioner. I didn&#x27;t see a difference in my hair. It smells great and works nice as a leave-in conditioner, but it didn&#x27;t make my hair extra shiny or manageable. I still had to apply another product to control the freeze and make my hair shiny. Not worth the expensive price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now use jojoba oil in my hair... I use it as an oil treatment before washing hair. And apply just a tiny amount of jojoba oil on my hair after blowdrying, makes my hair shiny and freezy free!! Plus locks in moisture and my hair is manageable and looks great! You can buy here on Amazon for a decent cost and will last for a long while. I also use it on my face, feet, and body... works great. All in one!!!</li>
            <li> Very unpleasant to use as it is slimy.  It was not too bad for one day then hair needed rewashing</li>
            <li> Had confidence in this product but didn&#x27;t think it would be this good! Makes my hair &amp; scalp feel sqeaky clean. Also I&#x27;ve noticed my hair styles last longer and doesn&#x27;t go flat like before when i was using shampoos. I&#x27;m hooked</li>
            <li> The best decision I have ever made for my hair is to start using &amp;#34;WEN&amp;#34;! It has helped restore my hair completely! My hair feels healthier, its shinier, it stay clean longer and it always smells amazing! I have tried almost all of the other types of the WEN cleansing conditioners, &amp;#34;Summer Mango Coconut&amp;#34; is my all time favorite, I use it all year round! I think its because of the coconut in it, my hair is at its best when I&#x27;m using this particular bottle, &amp;#34;Vanilla Mint&amp;#34; would have to be my second favorite! I tell all of my friends to start using WEN and I would definitely recommend it to ANYONE!</li>
            <li> I love, love, love Wen.  It is perfect as a cleanser and as a leave in product.  I have surly hair that is never dry because of Wen.</li>
            <li> love how this makes my hair feel healthier and soft without the extra weight.....I bought some as a gift also</li>
            <li> This is not the real Wen shampoo.  The pump didn&#x27;t fit the bottle and it smells nothing like the first bottle I had ordered from Wen.  My scalp broke out and my hair does not smell fresh with this product.  I only ordered through Amazon because I could no longer get this scent through Wen because it is a summer scent.  Do not purchase because you will get a cheap imitation!</li>
            <li> i love this one! it smells like a pina colada to me. i love how soft my hair gets using wen</li>
            <li> yum! I adore wen products, thats all I use. This one smells really good, very summery.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this product like so many others, but it just didn&#x27;t work for me.  I have thick, slightly wavy, treated hair, and my hair didn&#x27;t feel clean nor soft.  I had a residue left, and I spent a lot of time trying to wash out the product.  I probably got the wrong scent to - Mango Coconut - as it was a little overpowering for me.  I did give it to a co-worker who has medium-thick, straight hair, and she loves it.  So I think the texture and thickness of your hair will have a lot to do with how well this works.</li>
            <li> My hair is in love !  It has never felt so soft or looked so healthy........what a surprise.........a product that doesn&#x27;t let you down !  I shared with my sister and we are spreading the news.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not seeing the amazing difference yet, but maybe I need to use it longer than two weeks.  Wish they would give you a minimum time you should keep it on before rinsing as I take really quick showers.  Also, on TV it appears that the before / after model hair comparison is with the regular shampoo non styled vs the Wen cleansing conditioner styled and if so that is not a true comparison.  I normally do not style my hair, sometimes not even blow drying it, so is that why I won&#x27;t see the same results?  I do like the smell, but it is semi-strong, staying on like perfume, wish they had a non-smell version.</li>
            <li> WEN is such an amazing product! I don&#x27;t know what hasn&#x27;t already been said about it. My hair is in love with it. This fabulous WEN item was promptly received in excellent condition. :o)&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I have used the mint shampoo before and it worked great. The coconut one smells wonderful but must have different ingredients as it makes my hair very limp and dry. Almost like I have a bunch of hair product buildup in my hair. It could possibly work better for someone with  a different hair type.</li>
            <li> this product is somewhat good but it is just so ridiculous how much product you have to use on your hair to make foam. It is beyond expensive.&lt;br /&gt;I would not reommend it not worth the price. 16oz bottle last 2 weeks using every other day. it would make a big difference if was  cheaper.the hair looks somewhat better than the other shampoos but if you have a oily hair it leaves your hair flat.&lt;br /&gt;Think twice about expending $35 dollars in a bottle of shampoo. Go tresemee fantastic product.</li>
            <li> Wen builds up on hair, takes forever to rinse out and is not suitable as a cleanser for anyone who spends a good amount of time outdoors or exercising. If you use a small amount of a clarifying/no build-up shampoo everyday and then follow up with a small amount of Wen as a conditioner, it works well but no better than any decent conditioner you could purchase after a small amount of research. As a cleanser, it is not effective and, because of the buildup it leaves even after ten minutes of rinsing, it weighs hair down and makes it look dull and lifeless. A female African American friend insisted I try this, in spite of the marked difference in our hair (mine is medium in thickness, medium brown, and growing out of a pale white British scalp and hers is lush, thick, beautiful, spiral curling African American hair that is very dry and needs a lot of oil to keep from becoming brittle). She loves this product but she only washes her hair once or twice a week, at the most, washing that she used accomplish using an oil-wash followed by a deep conditioner which is oddly sort of how I would describe Wen, which she now uses for her once/twice a week hair routine, oily, sticky, deep-conditioning Wen. It is excellent for ethnic hair because the user can lather it on, let it soak in, spend an hour on the whole process, and, in doing it only once a week, not end up hating Chaz Dean for a good portion of every shower they take. Also, given that it never fully rinses out, the components of the formula that stick to the hair shaft actually act to protect the hair until those components finally start to wear off, according to her, after about four or five days. DAYS. I&#x27;m sorry for how stark this comment will be but I have no better way to say this: If you have thick ethnic hair due to African, Hispanic, Asian or Mediterranean heritage, this may be the best product you ever use (although there are a lot of really good products out there for ethnic hair that can achieve a similar result in terms of moisture and strengthening of hair) but if you are Caucasian or have fine or medium or even thick hair that is not incredibly dry to the point where you can&#x27;t wash it more than twice a week because it will break and fall out, you should NOT USE WEN. This is one of those rare instances where ethnic background does, unfortunately rule out certain people as clients of a company. The Wen spokesperson you may have seen most on TV is Alyssa Milano, a beautiful Italian girl who has thick, rich, dark ethnic hair that only looks fine/thin because of her overuse of hair dyes, styling products and heat due to her career choice and this beauty, while lovely as an actress and probably as a human being, is meant in the Wen commercial to represent the \\&quot;white\\&quot; girls. So, in short, Wen friendly&#x3D;Ethnic hair AND Wen disaster&#x3D;Typical Caucasian hair. Good luck deciding.</li>
            <li> I loved this product when I first got it. All of a sudden I started to lose massive amounts of hair.  Too expensive to throw out so sometimes I use it as a leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  It smells wonderful and my hair feels like silk.  It&#x27;s a little pricey, but worth it.  I&#x27;ve even gotten a friend of mine to try it.</li>
            <li> Who doesn&#x27;t like WEN? I don&#x27;t use it everyday, but when I do it makes my hair soft and clean.</li>
            <li> This specific one does not have wheat in it,  but I loose a lot of hair after I use it.</li>
            <li> smells good and works really nice , but if you use as much as the say to use each time , it could get very expensive.</li>
            <li> I have a very full head of very fine hairs--which are very prone to frizz, especially in humid weather. This stuff not only tames my locks but makes them shiny, too. My only complaint is its not effective at cleaning my scalp. Without a standard shampoo, I&#x27;m left with &amp;#34;cradle cap&amp;#34; like dandruff and after copious rinsing. So, I&#x27;ve been combining it with Head &amp; Shoulders Repair and Protect to great result.</li>
            <li> Hair felt heavy and dirty</li>
            <li> Bought product for my daughter and she really likes it. Hair feels softer and it looks healthier after using the product.</li>
            <li> works great, does what it is supposed to, helps dry, curly hair and thin straight hair, helps all hair types</li>
            <li> this is my favorite variety, ever.  Ever.</li>
            <li> I saw Chaz Dean&#x27;s infomercial for Wen and wanted to try it but did not want to be roped into auto renewal. I found his products for sale here, at Amazon, and bought the summer mango coconut scent fulfilled by a company who&#x27;s name I wasn&#x27;t familiar with. After it came I used it a few times with greasy, weighed down hair as a result. I came back and read the mixed reviews. It seems that people who ordered Wen through amazon but fulfilled by reputable sources (Sephora, for example) had great results. Others, especially with the mango coconut variety fulfilled by random sellers did not fare as well. I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s a knock off formula or if it&#x27;s just way past it&#x27;s shelf life (since the date on the bottom was &#x27;10)&lt;br /&gt;I decided to buy again, this time from QVC. My winter Cranberry Mint arrived quickly and my hair has been fabulous ever since! I love the Wen cleansing conditioner so much that I returned to QVC to purchase products for my mom, sister and three friends for upcoming birthdays!! It&#x27;s really as great as the infomercial says it is and I will be using Wen for a long time to come! BUT I won&#x27;t be buying it from anyone but QVC :)</li>
            <li> We love the silky smooth manageable feeling we get from wen. It smooths away flyaways and keeps my 10 year olds very long hair tangle free. Love the scent too!</li>
            <li> I have thinning hair and thought id give this a try. I use it as directed and rinse thoroughly, but every time in dry or straighten my hair, it gets stringy and greasy. It worked great the first time and now it seems as though the conditioner is building up in my hair. The bottle says you may not have to wash your hair every day...and I&#x27;ll try to wash my hair every other day...but the filmy grease in my hair makes me want to wash my hair twice a day. I feel like I need to use proper harsh shampoos to break the oiliness in my hair.</li>
            <li> With WEN I AM Pleased w/the texture and buoyancy of my tresses. Would purchase again and recommend o others.Thank you</li>
            <li> I am fairly new to WEN cleansing conditioner, I have bought this conditoner and the Sweet Almond Mint one, designed for all hair types but no comparison for me the Summer Mango definetley hydrated my hair 20x&#x27;s more then the Sweet Almond Mint and smells 20x&#x27;s better as well. I personally like to have great smelling hair and the Summer Mango did it for me! Satified customer for sure!</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Friends don&#x27;t let other friends use shampoo&amp;#34;, defenseless because it&#x27;s so true. It worked for me so I&#x27;m sure it will work for you&amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> I love using Wen but every so often I feel a residue. I am not sure if it is this scent that is causing this to happen. It has to be washed out really well and if it is, it works great! I find that it works best on color treated and dry hair. People that have fine or thin hair seem to say it just makes their hair greasy.</li>
            <li> Smells great, it&#x27;s like summer time in a bottle. Leaves hair so soft. Recommend.</li>
            <li> This smells wonderful and works great. I have coarse, thick hair. My hair has become so much softer since switching to this &amp;#34;shampoo&amp;#34; and only washing every 3 or 4 days. I don&#x27;t need any other products. Love it. I also like the green tea and lavender scents.</li>
            <li> I am a Wen user and have been ever since I first tried a sample packet.  I had reservations for sure and did not want to believe a conditioner could actually clean my hair but I was so wrong.  I wish I used this years ago.  I am hooking up all my girlfriends.  Each scent / flavor is for different hair types so pick the right one.  The Almond is for all hair types - Fig is for dry damaged, the Lavender for thin, oily etc.  I love the Summer Mango Coconut because it smells warm and yummy</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the Wen product line.  This cleanser is wonderful, gets hair very clean and has a nice ,summery scent.  Will purchase again.  I&#x27;ve used Wen for several months now and will never go back to shampoo, not even the phosphate free kind.  Love it!</li>
            <li> As an all in one, this didn&#x27;t work for my hair. I have thin hair and wash it very 2 days. This product left a resedue which made it feel greasy. However it was smoother and easier to style.  After 3 weeks of using, I started using regular shampoo and Wen as a leave in conditioner. So far,  so good. I still get a smoother look without my hair feeling weighed down or too greasy.</li>
            <li> I have been a &amp;#34;Wen Girl&amp;#34; for a few years now and the seasonal fragrances can be hard to come by sometimes!  This makes your hair smell like summer vacation any time of the year... and the product truly is as fabulous as the infomercials claim it can be!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great!!  It&#x27;s different from any other hair product I&#x27;ve used but I really like it.  It smells amazing too.  I heard this product was kind of thin but this particular one is creamy. The price was amazing and shipping fasssst!!!</li>
            <li> Awesome product. Makes my hair beautiful. I only usr Wen forever.You ypp will love this. I have many formulas of Wen. This is my favorite</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Wen for 2 years now, and I am amazed at what it&#x27;s done for my hair.  I was never able to grow my hair as long before as I am now, my hair is MUCH stronger now and is thicker than it has been since it&#x27;s no longer breaking as much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very fine hair and it tends towards the dry side at the ends.  But Wen makes it both clean and conditioned.  Here&#x27;s some of the tricks if you are new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  First of all, get your hair COMPLETELY soaked before you put the product on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  Section it off: I do 4 sections, but others who have thicker hair may need more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  Use at least three pumps (more for thicker hair).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.  Start massaging the product into your scalp first.  Really get in there and make sure the product is in at the scalp level.  Then slowly move towards the ends before moving to the next section.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5.  Once you are finished with each section, comb your hair.  Some of the product will come out with the comb, that&#x27;s ok.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. Apply a final couple of pumps of product to the ends only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7.  Let product sit in your hair while you shower, shave, etc.  (PS:  This product also is an excellent shaving cream)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8.  Rinse hair thoroughly.  By this I mean if you think your hair is rinsed, go back in and rinse it some more.  It seems to help the product &amp;#34;set&amp;#34; to end with cooler water at the end, if you can stand it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This formula is my favorite because it is incredibly moisturizing.  Although Chaz markets each scent for all hair types, the fact of the matter is they don&#x27;t all act the same.  This formula, probably because of the coconut, is a very dense, moisturizing formula of Wen.  I&#x27;m not sure if it would work for someone with extremely oily hair, I do tend towards an oily scalp and this formula cleans my hair just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give this a try, it&#x27;s worth the money!</li>
            <li> Well this stuff didn&#x27;t live up to the hype. I was curious about it for years after seeing women swear by it in commercials, but it&#x27;s just an average thick cream conditioner. It&#x27;s no different than any one I&#x27;ve ever tried. I think straight-haired women are wowed by this stuff just because they didn&#x27;t use conditioner before. I have 3c curls - so I have to use conditioner every time I wash otherwise I&#x27;d get a crow&#x27;s nest in my hair. Wen is nothing special, nothing to write home about. Save your money.</li>
            <li> No way is this for thin hair... not saying it claims to be but good lord this is way too heavy for someone with thin/fine hair.</li>
            <li> So disappointed with the product. The infomercials and most reviews are so great, so I was very optimistic about the product. After the first wash I lost triple the amount of hair I normally loose in the shower. My hair felt heavy and looked greasy after the first use. I thought I would try it a but longer- after two weeks of use- I still had the same results. I have lost so much hair and my hair looks gross and greasy- I can&#x27;t wear it down. I have long, thin hair so maybe this just isn&#x27;t the product for my hair type. Disappointed it didn&#x27;t work. Still on a mission to find a good shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you to amazon for issuing a refund- it&#x27;s an expensive shampoo and it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I have been useing WEN for over a year. Love the product results, not too happy with the fragrance. This Summer Mango scent is wonderful but it&#x27;s seasonal and not always available.  When I find it I buy all that I can.</li>
            <li> I wish I could buy gallllonnssss of this! The smell is complete PERFECTION. Plus it works wonderfully--just make sure to use plenty! I don&#x27;t count how many pumps I use; I just make sure that I have it all throughout my hair and that when I squeeze the ends, they are milky…if that makes sense. I also use a pump on the ends as leave in. Completely changed my hair. You&#x27;ll love the scent!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for four days....not really noticing much difference.  Have to use six pumps to do my hair, which is not long.  But it does smell great.</li>
            <li> i used the product three times to make sure i used it properly.  mademy hair greasy.  i have short hair so i did not use too much or too little</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a year, both me and my mother started using wen a little over a year ago. we are both in separate households within the past year my mother&#x27;s hair and my hair has dwindle down to almost nothing.  For years I&#x27;ve always been complemented on my thick long hair lately I&#x27;ve been struggling to part it, as to not show the thin spots.  I went to the doctors and dermatologist and the results showed nothing, it wasn&#x27;t until last night that I realized that my mothers use of Wen and my use of Wen started approximately the same time and during this time period both of our heads went from beautiful heads of hair to, sparse limp damaged hair.  I felt sick to my stomacher when I googled Wen Hair Loss and found page after page and blog after blog about women losing their hair after using Wen.  Something is wrong with this product, I realize you can&#x27;t please everyone but it can&#x27;t be a coincidence that so many people have the exact same complaint.  Thinning on the top and patches thru out the hair, everyone is reporting the same thing.</li>
            <li> Love it!  I have been using it for over three months and I am very pleased!  My hair dresser says my hair is in the best shape ever!</li>
            <li> Hard to get use to no suds, but it certainly makes your hair feel great!! And you don&#x27;t have to automatically reorder.</li>
            <li> I have used a few of the Wen flavors and I have to say that this one is the best!</li>
            <li> An interesting product...used as directed, hair feels and looks greasy. Great scent though. We use it like normal conditioner and it works well.</li>
            <li> I must say WEN never dissapoints, am glad that this will be my summer cleanser as it is suggested&lt;br /&gt;will use this vendor , they were on time, great packaging and great price. will use this vendor again, they were great.</li>
            <li> A real bargain. The size of the bottles is larger than the ones you get with the wen membership. I was happy.</li>
            <li> I have used this bottle up now and can honestly say I have noticed no difference in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, it feels lovely when you put it on and smells great.&lt;br /&gt;However, certainly not one of my &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; products</li>
            <li> This is the best fragrance and conditioning shampoo that I have ever tried. It&#x27;s the best of all the Wen products.</li>
            <li> This product made my hair immediately greasy and dry and I have never had greasy hair! I don&#x27;t know if I got the real WEN or the knock-off version... but I paid good money for a product that I won&#x27;t use again after the first couple times. SO disappointed.</li>
            <li> I love this WEN product.  I had tried another WEN product before this scent and was not impressed.  This is great.  I believe my color lasts longer with this product.</li>
            <li> this is a wonderful smell! like Sun and Surf and fun.... The CC works very well, my hair feels soft and manageable. The only complaint is the price, it&#x27;s a bit steep for just 16 oz. But if you have short hair, you could use less than what is recommended.</li>
            <li> Love the smell been ordering Wen on auto delivery for about 2-yrs straight now through Guthy Renker 2as sometimes getting the wrong order or it came to often so I tried this It l3ft my hair the same but left my scalp realky dry I suggest You order through the Wen Co. On here for the exact same ingredients!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s too heavy..it leaves my hair dead and lifeless....it smells great,but if you have really thick and naturally oily hair it weighs it down....I wasted 30.00 on this,non refundable</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT WORKS BEST WHEN PUTTING IT ON YOUR HAIR DRY WITH ONLY 5 PUMPS FOR YOUR WHOLE HEAD.THEN LEAVING IT ON FOR ONLY FIVE MINUTES,THEN RENSE AND COMB THROUGH CAREFULLY WITH BIG WIDE TOOTHED COMB.PROVIDED WITH US&lt;br /&gt;CURLY HEADED PEOPLE THAT YOU( FIRST) GO THROUGH YOU HAIR WITH YOUR FINGERS AND USE THE COMB,THEN AFTER ALL THIS BLOWDRY AND IT COMES OUT BEAUTIFUL.PLUS I BELIEVE THAT SUMMER MANGO( WHEN CAREFULLY USED) GROWS AND THICKENS YOUR HAIR MORE THEN THE ORIGINAL FORMULA.FOR PEOPLE OF COLOR IF YOU DON&#x27;T USE THIS PRODUCT THIS WAY OR SIMULAR TO THIS,IT BECOMES VERY TANGLED AND YOU LOSE BIG AMOUNTS OF HAIR TRYING TO UNTANGLE OR COMB THROUGH IT WHEN DRY.</li>
            <li> I love coconut and mangoes so this is the perfect scent for me! It also works better than a couple of other Wen scents, such as tea leaves and pomegranate (which don&#x27;t take away frizz as well). This Mango Coconut leaves my hair full &amp; thick (I have thin hair) yet not frizzy. Love it!</li>
            <li> My hair is the healthiest it&#x27;s ever been.my saloon has noticed the chair inmy hair. The color never fades and it makes it so manageable.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to use anything but this WEN scent for the rest of my life!</li>
            <li> my order arrived promptly and I love Chaz Dean shampoo.  I have not used other products, but the shampoo is great.</li>
            <li> I love the mango coconut scent.  I&#x27;ve tried a few other Wen cleansers and this is by far my favourite!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted to this stuff. Wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive though!  Once you go WEN you can&#x27;t go back!  Love it!</li>
            <li> Makes hair look &amp; feel great.  Highly recommend Wen system to everyone.  Amazon has unbeatable price.  Ordering was easy &amp; service was better then expected.</li>
            <li> I am glad I got this product. Makes a HUGE difference for my whole family. Don&#x27;t listen to bad reviews about Wen. Great product. I use more for a conditioner and a leave-in after I was with doTerra shampoo.</li>
            <li> Smells yummy, like a day at the beach or on a summer vacation.  A little heavy for my hair, so I use less than recommended.  I also use regular shampoo a few times a week and then use this as a leave-in conditioner with good results.</li>
            <li> The product was a very small bottle.  Although the smell was great, I didn&#x27;t like the feel of my hair after using.  I returned it.</li>
            <li> I actually didnt like it. My hair feels so greasy after I use it. I&#x27;ve tried it a few times now and same results.</li>
            <li> I purchased this after a few years of watching the infomercials and reading TONS of reviews. However, I was EXTREMELY disappointed in the product for myself. After two weeks of using it every other day, I had to give up. My hair is naturally dry and my scalp is by no streatch of the imagination oily. This stuff just made my hair and scalp so oily and gross feeling. I couldn&#x27;t take it any more and went back to my sulfate free botanical shampoo and my hair and scalp feel so much better.</li>
            <li> My hair is moisturized but I only sud once not twice. I able to detangle hair after I let it sit on for at least 15 mins. I rinse and add a little as a leave in conditioner. I may try a wash and go with it but I suspect that I wouldn&#x27;t have much shine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Wen for years and Mango Coconut is by far my favorite! My hair has never looked or smelled any better!</li>
            <li> Smell is to die for.... I do have to use extra to get the moisturizing I need.  I may purchase again.</li>
            <li> It was okay. Delivered quickly.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem any different than those $6.95 conditioners I always by with the same coconut/mango or Brazilian hazelnut type thingys.  Besides, at $50 a bottle and you want me to pump 15-17 per condition, think again.  This product did not wow me in the least.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the original WEN and had good results with that. However, I&#x27;ve tried the lavendar and the summer mango coconut since and my hair just gets greasy. It doesn&#x27;t feel clean when I&#x27;m done. I&#x27;m not getting a very smooth result. Disappointing.</li>
            <li> My wife was very excited when she ordered this product and she has been watching the infomercials for quite some time now. After using this item for over a month, she told me that her hair has not changed much other than I believe it smells good. however, it has not made her hair more manageable or given it shine and bounce like promised. She will not be ordering WEN again. However, at least she got to experience it and found out for herself.</li>
            <li> This was a summer WEN scent and formula that I found to be not only long lasting, thick and creamy, but one of the best, if not the best, of all WEN formulas I have tried.  Ranks up there with SixThirteen.  Absolutely love this one. Wish they had it every summer. And I am a long time WEN user.</li>
            <li> Love the coconut scent.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! My hair was brittle and majorly damaged from repeated dying and bleaching. This product saved my hair.</li>
            <li> OMG this is just your typical conditioner, didn&#x27;t do anything like the commercial...It also doesn&#x27;t make your hair feel any cleaner, just feels like you just skipped the shampoo and went straight to the conditioner! And what a waste of time to pump 6 times, comb and just to put more on your hair for nothing ...sorry but this just doesn&#x27;t cut it for me. Just weighed my hair down and I didn&#x27;t feel my hair was clean or more shiny</li>
            <li> Nice smell, but not worth the higher price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of different Wen products and this one by far smells the worst. It was much stronger than expected. You get used to it after a while but I definitely won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
            <li> Hair is healthy, shinny, hair grows well without split ends I would never go back to regular shampoo, have been using Wen for 2 years and I am happier after all this time!! GET RID OF REGULAR SHAMPOO TRY WEN AND YOU WILL KNOW WHY YOU HAVE SWITCHED AND STAYED WITH THIS PRODUCT!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I love the product and will enjoy using it.&lt;br /&gt;It is just what I was needing and looking for.&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
            <li> My hair has never looked or felt better!  I watched the tutorial online, and for my hair, it recommends a total of 30+ pumps of product per wash. After about 12 pumps, I saw large amounts of product on the shower floor. This seemed like a waste for such an expensive product, so I have just stuck to the 12 total pumps.  This is more expensive than regular shampoo and conditioner, I will end up spending about the same amount per year using just Wen because I won&#x27;t be continuously buying shampoo and conditioner, leave-in conditioner, anti-frizz serums, and other various hair products. All I use now is Wen. Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> THE BEST THING TO WASH YOUR HAIR IN</li>
            <li> Cleans well. But, I really like the Renpure better. It is a better price and cleans my hair much better. The scent of the Summer Mango Coconut is wonderful!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell as good as I thought it would. Still smells good, but it gets old fast.</li>
            <li> Noticed a difference in my hair with Wen, healthier shiny without that frizzy look that comes with highlighting, I am happy with this product, I recommend it to my friends all the time. This scent is my favorite, only problem it is seasonal. So happy to have found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Love WEN.  A new fragrance to try this summer.  Too expensive on WEN web site so I look for sales.</li>
            <li> The best smelling one yet!! I am obsessed with how amazing my hair looks with the wen products!! Holy grail product for sure!!</li>
            <li> This works even better than the Almond Mint I have used prior. So soft and smells amazing! Love, Love, Love it!!!</li>
            <li> Protects and preserve with smoothness and parfum.</li>
            <li> My wife has very curly hair, and she loves this product, she only wishes she could buy it in gallons, instead of these little bottles that a very expensive</li>
            <li> My favorite wen cleanser of all time so far.</li>
            <li> Lightweight and fresh scent</li>
            <li> this one is the best one for my hair</li>
            <li> the smell alone is awesome, but it conditions soooo well.. love it.&lt;br /&gt;the smell reminds me of the summer, which is over now..  its great stuff.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair smelling great and soft.  Wish they would not discontinue it but glad that Amazon carried it.  Met my expectations.</li>
            <li> This product is fake!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;After going to the WEN web site and participating dealers to find the &amp;#34;mango coconut&amp;#34; scent, I found out that this product was a fake and further more, when compared to a real WEN product the evidence is proof!!&lt;br /&gt;I am EXTREMELY disappointed in Amazon for allowing this.</li>
            <li> WEN products are excellent.  Shipping procedure was poor at best.  I have already made a complaint direct to Amazon.</li>
            <li> This product is terrible!!! I only used it a handful of times but every single time I was disappointed. After getting out of the shower by hair would be so dry and thirsty for moisture it would get frizzy in any kind of humidity (not good in Western Washington weather). It weighed down my hair and made it impossibly gritty feeling. I do have thin, fine hair that&#x27;s naturally blonde but currently a 3RB color. The only plus is it did not seem to effect my color at all and it smelled lovely, but I&#x27;d rather have my hair feel clean and soft not dirty, coarse, and heavy, though it didn&#x27;t look dirty. It is also extremely time consuming, so if you&#x27;re busy and time crunched as it is, this is definitely not the product for you! The bottle is far from ergonomic, either. With how expensive the product is, I&#x27;d expect it to be so much better than this.</li>
            <li> My Wife loves this . It makes her hair feel clean and soft . And I think it makes her hair smell great !</li>
            <li> Works well on long hair, the scent is nice and not overpowering</li>
            <li> i love the wen products i use the tea tree and the lavender,also the  6 13 i really like them but to me this is the best!!my hair is naturally curly thick and is prone to get frizzy .this one leaves my unruly hair soft &amp; silky. my hair is also dyed so it becomes dry ...but not with this one i love the scent. this is one of his seasonal scents and chaz has said they will only have this for the summer and it will not be made again..so i am stocking up now</li>
            <li> I tried my new WEN product and am less than impressed.  It smells great, and even though it does not lather, my hair does feel clean I guess, but it is dully, not at all shiny.  My cheaper shampoos and conditioners leave my hair much shinier and soft.  I am not impressed.  I may use it now and again, but it will not be a daily product, and I would not order it again.  I was very disappointed, but not surpised as I rarely fall for gimicky informercial products!</li>
            <li> This product is ok,  not as fantastic as the commercials lead you to believe.  The other reviews that say, \\&quot;it will ruin your hair\\&quot;,  that is a little extreme, I have very fine fragile hair and it does seem to be quite gentle.  The first time I used it my hair felt very soft and full bodied, but after a few uses you feel like you need to use regular shampoo, especially if you go to the gym and sweat alot your hair will be greasey no matter how much of the product you use.  I don&#x27;t know if the original sent is any different but I don&#x27;t think I will order it again.  Nice try Chaz, I think everyone will try this once and not get it again.</li>
            <li> I have tried the Lavender, Winter Mint, and now the Mango Coconut. I read so many reviews before making my purchases, and these particular items seem to be the best for my hair type. Fine, but lots of hair, and it is somewhere between wavy and curly, prone to frizz. I love the smell of this, and my hair simply behaves better. The other two are good as well, but this is my favorite so far.</li>
            <li> Wen is an amazing product.  I&#x27;ve been using it now for the past two years.  I&#x27;ve always used high-end salon products or expensive natural products purchased at Whole Foods etc.&lt;br /&gt;and my diet, where hair health begins, is good.  Despite the good products &amp; healthy diet, using Wen made a huge difference in how my hair looks and feels.  Hairdressers ask me&lt;br /&gt;what I&#x27;m using .... because my hair is so healthy!  Wen helps offset the changes that happened with age, leaving my hair silky, shiney, bouncey and full-bodied.&lt;br /&gt;  I was a little nervous that this version would be heavily scented and have been pleasantly surprised .... love it!&lt;br /&gt;  All that said, I think it&#x27;s a shame that the company behind the product has set a prohibitively expensive price tag on its products.  With the constant TV &#x27;programs&#x27; about&lt;br /&gt;it, I guess that&#x27;s why.  As someone approaching retirement and due to have to manage a fixed income, I won&#x27;t be able to afford this product that I love.  That would be the&lt;br /&gt;only reason I would ever stop using Wen.</li>
            <li> wen products are the best i have ever used , it has been about 4 years that i have been using wen cleansing conditioners and i am totally satisfied.</li>
            <li> My family was going on vacation to Hawaii so I bought this to use there.  We usually use the basic Sweet Almond Mint but I thought that this would be a fun change for our trip.  Anyway, it was terrific!  I like it so much better!!!  We all have somewhat different hair types but it was great for all of us - soft and silky hair and not at all heavy or greasy, even if my kids didn&#x27;t get it completely rinsed out!!!  I really liked the scent  and did not find it overpowering at all.  I hope that they bring it back next year.  Actually,  I would love them to sell it year round in the larger size.</li>
            <li> This is my 6th bottle of Wen. I&#x27;ve tried almost all of them and this is my favorite by far. I have fine, color treated hair. This scent doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down or make it feel greasy. I even do a pea size amount as a leave in. Feels great, and the scent is yummy!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Asian So I Have Thick Crazy Hair ,,, I Been Using WEN for a month . I&#x27;m telling you I&#x27;m never going back to ANY OTHER SHAMPOO EVER AGAIN !! .. WEN Is The Best Thing Out Dealing With Hair</li>
            <li> The scent is wonderful  looking to purchase more! Thank You for your help!</li>
            <li> I have used Wen. I personally have been satisfied, eliminates traveling with 3 or 4 different items. This one mango/coconut smells so good. Great for the summer. This is my traveling companion this summer.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrence and enjoy using it everyday.I would suggest this to everyone who uses conditioner this is  the one worth every penney</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is a knock off or not.  The bottle is a different size than normal and it did not come with a pump head.  PLUS, the smell is not as strong as the previous Mango I purchased.  It does seem to do the job though.</li>
            <li> Since discovering Wen no shampoo has touched my head.  It is so pleasant, and my hair has loved it.  It makes it soft, healthier, and smelling beautiful.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipment. This product really works the way it was described on TV. I noticed the difference in my hair after one use.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it was made for my hair type. I have fine hair that is highlighted. I liked the smell. I won&#x27;t be buying this product again.</li>
            <li> Wen is great stuff my hair always feels so good when I use this properly , I want all of the scents</li>
            <li> The product itself is fine, but the pump does not work at all. It is stuck completely down.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. Can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> Really love this scent for summer.  Hard to find.</li>
            <li> I love it but is very expensive and I will no be able t continue use of this product to do expense</li>
            <li> Love WEN products. Makes my hair so soft &amp; healthy! Love the smell of Summer Mango Coconut!&amp; that it&#x27;s not tingly!</li>
            <li> i have hair that gets oily fairly quickly.  this is horrible for me!  my hair is oily within 8 hours of using this.  since i paid a decent amount for it, i&#x27;ve decided to use it on my ends as a conditioner, and use a shampoo before hand.  i wont buy this again.</li>
            <li> Smells really good and I love the way it makes my hair feel.  This is my second bottle</li>
            <li> The WEN I first bought was the lavender, but the Mango Coconut is by far better for my hair. I have fine, straight gray hair and it is just wonderful!</li>
            <li> Ok, so now that I&#x27;ve tried the Sweet Almond Mint and the Tea Tree, I just had to try the Summer Mango Coconut and it did not disappoint.  It smells wonderful and it leaves my hair looking fabulous, just like the others.  I gave my friend some of the Summer Mango Coconut to try and she loves it too and will be ordering Wen.  I have to say, that I am hooked!</li>
            <li> Like all Wen users, I love a bargain.  This scent was new for me, but very nice.  Very summer!  The Mango-Coconut formula is very hydrating, more so than the Pomegranate, about the same as the Fig.  Really great on my fine, curly, colored hair.  Ordered through my Prime account, so I knew I was getting genuine product.  Received with the pump, no issues.</li>
            <li> So not worth the price. Smells great (yes), makes hair soft (yes), does miracles (no). I have been using Palmers coconut oil conditioner and I get better results. This is honestly just sitting in my shower. It kinda weighs down my this hair and I see no difference in it&#x27;s health...</li>
            <li> I, like many other people, decided to try this product after seeing infomercial after infomercial. When I received the product, the directions stated that you have to pump 30-40 pumps into your hair each time you wash. If you did this, you would use the bottle in a week.  It sits heave on your scalp and within a day, your scalp is oily and matted.  It did condition my hair well on the ends and I only had to use five pumps for that and my hair is rather long.&lt;br /&gt;Save your money.</li>
            <li> .I&#x27;ve wanted to try wen products for awhile but the mixed reviews made me leery . I found this one and the mango coconut scent is really what caught my attention. I&#x27;ve used this product about five times and for the price I feel like I should be way more impressed. It smells amazing but that&#x27;s the best thing about it. It does cleanse well and does not make my hair oily. I have noticed more hair than usual falling out but I also don&#x27;t comb through my hair with regular shampoo and conditioner so that could be why. My hair feels and looks exactly the same as when I use my regular products. I was expecting some kind of noticeable difference for the price of this stuff. I won&#x27;t buy it again and dont really recommend</li>
            <li> Im a fan of Wen, it makes my hair look amazing. My color lasts longer and my hair is so healthy. This scent is my favorite. Only bummer is Wen makes my dandruff worse so once a week I used a dandruff shampoo.</li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love it!!! My hair is now soft and shiny!!! Will definitely purchase again. Would recommend this product to all.</li>
            <li> I wanted a different fragrance so I ordered this one. I am not disappointed. I have been using WEN for 7+ years, it is expensive but I do not have any spit ends or dry hair. See my other WEN product review for specifics</li>
            <li> This is a good product the smell wasn&#x27;t too harsh and left my hair smelling fresh and clean. no issues</li>
            <li> I was kind of worried about paying this much for a hair care product, but it was worth it.  I haven&#x27;t cut my hair in over thirty years, not even trimmed it, the ends of my hair looked so lifeless and dead, this product turned it around.  Even my hair color looks more like it did when I was younger, the shine is amazing and if feels wonderful.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best smelling Wen I&#x27;ve tried yet. I can&#x27;t use Wen everyday because of the build up, but every few days it does wonders for my hair.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time! My wife realy likes this product, and I don&#x27;t have to subscribe to wen either. I can just purchase here on amazon</li>
            <li> I had seen the 30 minute commercial playing at the gym many times. So, I though I would give it a try. I have short layered hair. It did make my hair soft, but it also weighed down my hair. I didn&#x27;t like it. If you look at all the people in the commercial they have long hair.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t fond of the smell, and this particular WEN left my hair greasy. I really like WEN, but I think I&#x27;ll stick with the original sents. Works good on my daughters hair though, so it is getting used. Will continue to purchase WEN, but not this sent.</li>
            <li> I have been using WEN cleansing conditioners since December 2012 and recommend this product.  I have skin allergies and this one doesn&#x27;t make me get a rash.  Most other shampoos/conditioners bother me so I was very happy to find WEN.</li>
            <li> Really good for your hair</li>
            <li> All it did was make my hair greasy and flat.  It looks terrible.&lt;br /&gt;I hate it and I wish I had not wasted $32.00 on this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend this \\&quot;cleanser\\&quot; at all.&lt;br /&gt;If I could get my money back, I would, but I am sure because it is opened, it&#x27;s too late.&lt;br /&gt;Smells great and would probably make a good moisturizer for your feet.&lt;br /&gt;Seriously.</li>
            <li> My hair has never looked better. I am getting compliments because gray hair changes even if it is colored. I no longer have wirey hair. My hair looks thick and smooth. I recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> Love Love Love wen!!!!!! it makes my hair super silky and smooth. I will never use shampoo again</li>
            <li> Problem # 1 never could get the pump to pop up, so I have to leave it open to use it.&lt;br /&gt;Problem #2 I bought this for the wonderful smell of mango and/or coconut.  This shampoo has neither. nothing&lt;br /&gt;But it sure does make my hair look healthy and full. So I like it.</li>
            <li> loved it, love this product, I am sold. it makes my hair feel the softest it has ever been. and it is very healthy now</li>
            <li> I will continue to buy this over and over again! At first it was hard to get used to this product, but within a week I have grown to LOVE it. My hair has never been so shiny! I typically have oily hair, but not with this product. It leaves my hair feeling soft and clean! It smells great too! I have also bought the Wen for Kids for my children. They love it!</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance and it&#x27;s a great cleansing conditioner.  On my 2nd bottle of this one and will buy more.</li>
            <li> It was as described.  My wife loves this stuff.  It does work.</li>
            <li> I have been using Wen products since 2010.  Always satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> We love Wen products (my 17 year old daughter and I) We dont use it year round as we cant always afford it. Normally my daughter loves the almond and I love the pomegranite but the sound of this special summer scent appealed to us. We both used it right away, and the smell is awesome. Even my 4 year old son stopped his sister to tell her her hair smelled awesome. I felt it didnt feel the same as my usual Wen, but once I \\&quot;lathered\\&quot; up and rinsed out, I loved how cleanly it rinsed out..and very easily and it is just as soft and easy to comb as with any other Wen product. I am stoked to use something new, in the fall I would go back to our old favorites though. DOnt love it enough to replace those. Like it enough to say I would switch in summer though. I would buy again.</li>
            <li> I have been using Wen for almost 2 years. I bleach my hair and the condition it is in is fantastic. everyone wants to know how I keep it so healthy. I really believe it is using Wen. I will never use a detergent shampoo again.</li>
            <li> Now, as I&#x27;ve read most of these posts, these women actually expect immediate results as said in the infomercial. If any of them posessed common sense they would know better that nothin new to the hair or body works immediately. It&#x27;s like saying one workout session to lose 20 pounds works over night. Anything new to the bod takes time, when it comes to the hair at least three months to fully adjust to a different product. Now I will admit there will be greasy scalp the first while but THE TRICK is to wash any conditioner you use at least two inches away from the scalp and it prevents it from getting ready for a couple little longer than if you washed the roots.&lt;br /&gt;WEN may not work for everyone but it&#x27;s all about giving it time. Just ask your stylist, they&#x27;ll say the same.&lt;br /&gt;One last thing to add, some WEN&#x27; s have worked different on my hair, AND I never use as many pumps as they say it&#x27;s just a waste, use what u feel is needed with you&#x27;re length and type, I&#x27;ve just stuck with the almond . However I do wanna try the coconut mango cause it simply sounds like it will smell so good. ^_-,  I hope you like it.</li>
            <li> My hair is fantastic using the WEN cleansing conditioners.  Buy the comb as well for thoroughly cleansing your hair without shampoo.</li>
            <li> I love WEN but it&#x27;s too expensive. I usually try to mix it with cheaper cleansing conditioner so it will last longer. The coconut smells so good. I wish I could afford to use it exclusively. I love the way it makes my hair feel and smell.</li>
            <li> I was just introduced to this line of products. I love how my hair feels and I love all the great smells.&lt;br /&gt;My only concern is that this did not come boxed.  It came shrink wrapped.</li>
            <li> HAVING MED/THICK WAVY HAIR THIS WEN PRODUCT HAS JUST THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF MOISTURIZING AND THE SMELL IS OUT OF THIS WORLD!!!  SMELLS LIKE SUMMER YEAR ROUND!!!! LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> Perfect Scent !!! Not too strong but smells soooo good !!! I went straight from Pumkin Clove to this one and they are both amazing !!! LOVE WEN !!! Changed my hair forever ....my hair color LAST forever now !! I am blonde and always dye my hair dark but it always faded ...not with WEN !! Color last and looks sooo rich !!</li>
            <li> Excellent hair product.  I highly recommend it for fine and colored hair.  I found the directions call for more use of product than is necessary.  Four pumps is enough for my  hair, but others might need more.  I do not need extra to leave in.</li>
            <li> Really this is a great product, and my wife highly recommends this for anyone with dry damaged or brittle hair.</li>
            <li> I think this product was extremely old such as expired it was almost dried out and was very disappointing to wash my hair I look like a grease ball with in an hour.&lt;br /&gt;I have used other wen  such as pumpkin spice with great results.&lt;br /&gt;This product must be several years old.</li>
            <li> this is a great product!!! I will always buy this... it makes my hair soft and shinny and full of body &amp; knowing that I&#x27;m not putting nasty things in my hair makes it even better... it&#x27;s a little pricy but worth the cost. the 16oz. bottle lasts me almost two months... the mango coconut has a great smell and it lasts all day long!!! i just love it!!!</li>
            <li> HAIR FELL OUT.  can only believe that from the time of just a few treatments lots of hair loss occured due to the product.  After stopped using, hair loss stopped. heard others report this as well... now can concur.</li>
            <li> I loved the smell but it only worked good on my hair for about a month.  It started to gunk up.  I think you need to give a good cleaning with shampoo once a month.</li>
            <li> I have very difficult hair - every stylist I&#x27;ve ever seen has agreed with me.  Due to severe Trichotillomania as a child, my hair grew back in several different textures ranging from extremely kinky to fine and straight.  I wear my hair up a lot.  A LOT.  In addition to this issue, it&#x27;s red, which means I have to color it every 5 minutes to keep the gray at bay.  It&#x27;s very, very dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This past week I ordered Wen as a last resort before chopping all my hair off.  I&#x27;ve been wearing it curly / up for the past few weeks and the last time I wore it down, I looked like a scarecrow.  I used Wen on Wednesday of this week but felt forced to wear it up / curly that morning anyway due to the ridiculous weather in Chicago.  I used it again this morning (Friday) and decided I didn&#x27;t care - I was going to wear it down today despite the wind and humidity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair looks amazing.  I&#x27;ve received so many compliments today.  I blew it dry with a large round brush like I always do when I wear it down, except this time I needed a lot less product and I barely had to do any extra styling.  My hair is actually bouncy - it has never been bouncy in my life.  I think I&#x27;m sold, despite the high price tag.  I also notice my roots aren&#x27;t so visible as they were last week, which is great, as I was getting ready to dye my hair again and can now probably wait at least another week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Common sense tells me this is not a product for people with oily hair.  This is for those of us with extremely dry hair who need a little weight in our locks.  I have friends who would use shampoo twice a day if they could - their hair is that oily.  My husband is one of them.  I have actually gone well over a week before with zero shampoo - only getting my hair wet and &amp;#34;washing&amp;#34; with a cheap conditioner like Suave - and at the end of the week I barely had any oils my hair.  That method was great and super cheap, but it did leave a waxy build-up on my hair over time. It doesn&#x27;t seem like Wen will do that.  Here&#x27;s hoping, anyway.  It&#x27;s sure nice to have a good hair day despite the weather!</li>
            <li> Brought this for the wife. As far as I know, she likes it very much!!!</li>
            <li> It makes my hair soft, but it smells like some kind of dog shampoo or flea bath...I feel that the original almond mint Wen smells and works better than this one...I really despise the smell of this to the point that I just won&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> This scent, along with the fig and fall apple spice, is one of my favorites of the Wen cleansers. The smell is so yummy and sweet! Love it! I like that the consistency of this scent is much more fluid than some of the other wen scents. I really like Wen cleansers - even though they are rather pricey! - they make my hair feel soft and manageable (and I have long, curly, frizzy hair!). I&#x27;ve been a fan of Wen for years, but wish the piece was a bit less!</li>
            <li> Love it. Love the great smell! I am a true Wen girl. :)</li>
            <li> leaves hair softer, smoother, and smelling better than ever before!</li>
            <li> ...came across an article regarding an &#x27;epidemic&#x27; on skin allergies that caught my eye because I had been having the same problem....&lt;br /&gt;article link:  [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my comment to the article was:&lt;br /&gt;Wen by Chaz Dean shampoos also has MCI and MI in it....thank you for this article, as for the past year and half plus, I have been breaking out with massive contact dermatitis around my nose and mouth, couldn&#x27;t figure out what was causing it...I had to resort to  using steroid creams trying to make it go away...after reading this article, I double checked my products I use and was SHOCKED when I read the labels on my Wen hair care products...I do NOT wash my hair every day....which makes sense now on why my face would just about be cleared up and on the 3rd day when I would wash my hair it would seem that it would all start over again....red blotchy blistery mess, heck I didn&#x27;t even have acne problems as a teenager and couldn&#x27;t figure out what the heck was going on... night before I was going to use my Wen shampoo would have been the 3rd day since last used, skin was nearly clear again, had just come across this article checked the label what a HUGE difference with not using now, I am SOOOO very happy I read this article...my husband uses Pantene Pro-V and that ALSO has it it listed....Organix Teatree Mint Shampoo does NOT have it; however, Organix Teatree Mint CONDITIONER DOES contain MCI and MI....L&#x27;Oreal sulfate free body conditioner does NOT contain MCI and MI; and I must admit my hair actually smelled better, felt better and looked better as well:)  Oh well, now I will check EVERY product I buy to verify it does not have these ingredients in them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AND then I called Wen by Chaz Dean and the result:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;just called Wen by Chaz Dean and because I order in large quantities every 3 months, there policy is they&#x27;ll buy back products (including empty bottles) IF sent back within 60 days....so I&#x27;m S.O.L....even after I told them of my problem including doctors and prescriptions among others they didn&#x27;t even offer to buy them back now even  after I brought up that issue.....oooohhhh not a wise move Chaz Dean corporation....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so now I will put all on notice...in case this is happening to you.</li>
            <li> I read a lot of reviews on this before buying and bought this individually before subscribing to the Wen home delivery. You use A LOT of this product (my hair is down to mid back) so be prepared for that. Once you get the hang of it, (takes about week and a half/two weeks) it does some amazing things. I will just sit there and play with my hair because it is so soft!! I did have issues with not feeling &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; with it so once a week I use a normalizing shampoo to strip what grease I feel is there out and then condition with the Wen. Seems to work just great and as I said, I now subscribe to the Wen home delivery. The coconut smell is faint once on, but in the shower it smells amazing :) I&#x27;m not crazy about the other products you get in the Wen package (styling products and rewetting mist) but I keep them on hand and try every so often to make them work. I think it&#x27;s worth at least one bottle to try the cleansing conditioner as the results are amazing :) just be patient and remember to use more than you think you need. Your hair should be saturated with the product and keep it on for the duration of the shower before cleansing completely. Hope you enjoy!!</li>
            <li> this is one product that smells great, and is just the slippery creamy sulfate free conditioner that is great for all hair types ESPECIALLY African American kinks, curls and coils! but the price can be daunting. nevertheless, I have several bottles in my closet and will continue to purchase. I found this one to be the slickest, and a little dab works nicely as a leave in conditioner. I have kinky spiral hair..this products is fantastic!</li>
            <li> Yes, men love this product too!  He has thick black hair cut short and this product makes his hair shine like krazy.</li>
            <li> i have long very thin hair and color treated:&lt;br /&gt;I have tried literally every scent of WEN.. This one and Winter Mint are def my Favs...&lt;br /&gt;They leave my hair very easliy managable and soft, but if I dont wash my hair for a day it gets greasy very very fast.</li>
            <li> This Cleansing Conditioner is great and the commercial on TV is correct. WEN makes my hair soft and manageable even on African American hair. The price is awesome and I am not stuck in a 3 month buying plan since I wash my hair once or twice a week this product will last longer than 3 months. I strongly encourage this product for African American hair.  &amp;#34;Dot&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Awesome! Great beach like scent and the same great Wen! I hope they bring this back for summer again! LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> Second time I order Wen by Caz Dean cleansing conditioner I&#x27;m very happy with it, and I love the price and such quick service.</li>
            <li> Wen is a really good product that smells so good and make s your hair so soft. Good price and a great product!!</li>
            <li> Love the different flavors and the product.  Would definitely recommend to others to try this type Cleansing Conditioner.  I have been using it for about 1 year.  I still supplement occasionally with a favorite shampoo too.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite scents.  I enjoy almost all the different fragrances and having been using Wen for over a decade.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and i LOVE LOVE LOVE how my hair feels now! My hair usually frizzes after washing it and even after straightening it but after using Wen it has completely tamed my hair. This product works wonders and I HIGHLY recommend it to anyone looking for a good change. I&#x27;ve struggled a lot with my hair, being mixed and all, but this product has made a difference.</li>
            <li> Amazing. The best ever for winter weather hair.</li>
            <li> I ordered this from the Wen site.  I actually thought I would be wasting my money.  But this cleansing conditioner is fabulous.  I have thick, damaged, african american hair.  I am transitioning and no longer perm my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it like a shampoo weekly.  I use a couple of pumps in my hair as a leave in and styler daily.  I don&#x27;t use anything else and my style lasts all day.  I carry a mist spray with me to moisturize during the day and I haven&#x27;t even used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would strongly recommend that EVERYONE give this product a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My next test is to see how long this bottle lasts me (i have the 12 oz) and if my hair starts to grow in better and stronger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For now, I have no plans on using heat or other products on my hair.  If I do go to the salon, I will bring this with me.  I am already planning on giving away my other hair products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am someone that has used a bunch of hair products over the years and I can&#x27;t believe that I am hooked on this pricey item.  But the price balances itself out since I will have less salon visits and stop using a bunch of other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update this review if my opinion changes.</li>
            <li> I have been using Wen cleansing conditioners for about two years now and i like most of them. My hair is oily so the tea tree one works best for me. The summer edition is not my favourite because it doesn&#x27;t make my scalp tingle and the scent is a little too overwhealming for me. Too sweet. Other than that, it works just as well as all other Wen cleansing conditioners. They all make my hair sooooo soft and healhy looking.&lt;br /&gt;I will not be purchasing this specific scent again though.</li>
            <li> I love Wen! I especially love the Mango Coconut scent!</li>
            <li> Love this product. Wish it was always available. I would buy this another 100 times.</li>
            <li> This shampoo was great for about a week, until my hair started falling out!!!!!! Like clumps and clumps of the stuff!!! Not natural! Not to mention the horrible buildup it leaves on your locks, it will just weigh down your hair. I gave it two stars because it smells amazing and that&#x27;s it. Other than that, take the risk yourself if you want your hair falling out in giant clumps!</li>
            <li> I have used WEN for a while now and love it.  However, this particular scent broke me out in a rash wherever it ran when I rinsed. It was a little while before I realized what was causing the rash so I used the product and cannot return it.</li>
            <li> I have one complaint and that is the small quantity. I wish this came in 4 or even 8 ounces. I could just refill a small bottle from a more bulk supply. I think it would be good for the planet to reduce the number of these little bottles. I like this product and use it almost daily to wake my curl up and refresh my hair. Great when it hits the face too.</li>
            <li> I have tried WEN many time always to go back to shampoo after a while.  I think the WEN is great to use part time not everyday, it seemed to make my hair too oily, after prolonged use.  I get oil scalp but very dry ends I can usually only stand to use it 2-3 days in a row then I just feel I need to shampoo. It did help tremendously with my dry ends, and it doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down.  I have used it on my Blonde daughter and her hair has never been so shiny!!  The mango coconut smell is amazing I loved it until I smelt the Magnolia spring one which is even better smelling! Great to use here and there but hard to use full time.</li>
            <li> I have tried Wen before from a friend and loved it so much I wanted to order it myself. However, I didn&#x27;t like the auto order and pay you have to sign up for with original Wen. So I found Amazon had it and was dying to try the Mango Coconut. I absolutely loved it. Coconut is such a great smell for summer and it really gave my hair body, shine, and life. I will continue to buy Wen from Amazon because I feel comfortable in knowing I control my purchases. Thanks to Wen and Thanks to Amazon.com!</li>
            <li> I love the WEN products. I have wavy somewhat dry hair and this product helps keep my hair from being frizzy and it makes it very easy to style or even air dry.  I really like the tropical Mango Coconut,it&#x27;s my favorite.</li>
            <li> I have colored, permed and thus very dry hair. Many reviewers stated the Coconut smell was over powering, I did not find this to be the case, it is very pleasant. The smell of the product does not linger on the hair after it is rinsed, but my hair does smell good. I get much better results in assisting with my dry hair with this product then I do with traditional shampoo/conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;I use less pumps to coat/wash my hair then the directions indicate, I use only enough to coat the hair then I comb through it as directed with the large toothed comb. Some reviewers also stated that the product leaves a residue and leaves the hair weighed down. I did not find this to be the case.&lt;br /&gt;I also use the Intensive Moist Hair Treatment Sweet Almond in conjunction with the Mango Coconut Cleansing/Conditioner with every \\&quot;shampoo\\&quot; and I love the results.  Every other treatment I leave on for 60 minutes. The other times I leave on for about 10 mins.&lt;br /&gt;The products are very pricey but they do produce the results. I purchase on Amazon as I do not want to get locked into the WEN auto ship program. I did check the pricing and I pay no more on Amazon and with Prime I pay no shipping.</li>
            <li> I have used several Wen products and like the way my hair looks and styles.  I color my hair and find the color does last longer.  I find the condition of my hair to actually look better.  No split ends and little breakage.  My only complaint is that my hair often looks greasy, especially my bangs.  Mango really smells nice.</li>
            <li> I love wen and this is no exception. I think this might actually be my absolute wen fragrance/formula. Currently I am enjoying winter Cranberry Mint which is also great. Both of these versions are perfect for men not too flowery but still smells wonderful. I myself only need one pump for my hair and one pump to shave with and it gives an excellent close smooth moisturizing shave experience. I also like the fall apple spice and the ginger pumpkin. I bought the bamboo but haven&#x27;t had a chance to try it yet.</li>
            <li> Smells like a beach vacation in the tropics. Works wonderfully. I can&#x27;t say a single bad thing about to product. I love Wen. I can&#x27;t imagine going back to regular shampoo and conditioner ever again. I&#x27;ve tried it and it&#x27;s just never been the same!</li>
            <li> WEN is okay, but not worth the price. I am using S Factor which is much easier, cheaper, and yields much better results!</li>
            <li> CHAZ DEAN MADE THE PERFECT PRODUCT, HE SHOULD BE PROUD!!! MY HAIR LOOKS AND FEELS JUST LIKE WHAT THE INFOMMERCIAL SAID IT WOULD AND SMELLS AMAZING:)</li>
            <li> this is by far the best conditioner ever left my hair shiny and soft and I have corse curly hair so happy with this product and it was shipped immedialty</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and my hair has never been healthier. Just make sure you use more than you think and separate your hair as you apply to get all the parts. I found if I didn&#x27;t, I had greasy looking hair which only needed some dry shampoo to fix but when in doubt, use more shampoo!</li>
            <li> Nothing compares to WEN CC.  I have tried many other so called CC&#x27;s but they pale in comparison for cleaning, shine and manageability.  I dont&#x27; mind spending more for this product cuz I&#x27;m worth it and I work hard and deserve it.</li>
            <li> While many rave about the Winter Vanilla Mint - I like to think of summer in the middle of winter.  Yes, Christmas has come and past and all I wanted for Christmas was Summer Mango Coconut WEN.  I use it as more of a once a week conditioning treatment because of the price - but for my daughter&#x27;s hair that tangles - it is the only thing I can use (mix half part water/half part wen) - put in a spray bottle - to get those tangles out.  My hair used to get really bad in the winter tangly-breakage - but not so far this year, thank you!!!!!!!  For those of us with tangle messes, you know how frustrating it can be.  What I really like about WEN is no matter how much I need to get those tangles out of my daughter&#x27;s hair - it doesn&#x27;t make her hair greasy.  I can spray and spray as needed---and when it dries - her hair looks great!!!!  I like many other people - have tried many different products for tangles and many DO NOT work- but this does--believe me, I know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So anyways-the Summer Mango Coconut-had to try it-Merry Christmas to me!!!! Got it and like I had hoped-smelled it and felt like it was not snowy and not the end of December- but more like spring break and where&#x27;s the palm tree????? sun tan lotion??? let me find my swimsuit:)  Love the smell and will be conditioning (leaving it in for a long time) my hair once a week this winter.  My weekend of fooling my nose into thinking I&#x27;m near the beach...love, LOVE it!</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful scent, but Wen shampoo is the best I have ever used, bar none!  I will never go back to using regular shampoo ever again, so Chaz, please don&#x27;t ever stop making this awesome shampoo.  You will throw away all your other hair products, shampoos and conditioners after trying it, so it&#x27;s worth every penny!  Every scent of Wen is great, including the original scent.  Wow, what an awesome product!  I loveeeeeeee it!!!!</li>
            <li> This really is a great Cleansing Conditioner for my daughter that has dry wavy hair.  It battles frizz well.  I use it often but can&#x27;t every day.  It will make mine too oily.  It keeps my daughters hair shiny and knot free.  I highly recommend for dry hair.</li>
            <li> I love the way that Wen feels in my hair. I have very thick, wavy, and frizzy hair. When I use Wen, it&#x27;s so smooth - but still wavy. Which is okay. I used to use the vanilla mint but I didn&#x27;t really like the smell too much. The mango coconut just smells amazing! Like summertime. My boyfriend can&#x27;t stop smelling my hair and neither can I.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been having trouble with dry scalp during the winter months. I&#x27;ve tried changing my shampoo and  putting an oil treatment on my scalp, but nothing has worked. My friend suggested trying Wen since it worked for her. I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 days now and I see a difference. My hair is softer and smoother. My scalp also isn&#x27;t as itchy. I have hair down to the middle of my back and I followed the recommended amount each time. I didn&#x27;t rinse and repeat though because I read it might weigh down your hair. The Summer Mango Coconut scent is great during this cold weather. It smells like a pina colada and the scent lasts for awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: Make sure you really rinse the product out well!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using WEN for years, and I love the price.  Don&#x27;t really like the auto-ship every month though, and don&#x27;t use the other products, just the cleansing conditioner.  However, I was very disappointed to find this on QVC for 10 dollars less than here, after I bought it.  It&#x27;s expensive to begin with, and one of my few luxuries on a limited budget.</li>
            <li> U love Wen shampoo and so do my friends. The  mango coconut smells so good. Try it you will like it.</li>
            <li> This has tamed my hair. It feels so much healthier and is much more manageable... Bonus, it smells incredible! I recommend to everyone!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smells great and I ordered more</li>
            <li> i  order the  mango  and  coconut  a  couple  a  days  a  go.  i  used  it  this  morning.  my  hair  is  growing  and  then  smell  is  great.  also  i  shaved  my  legs  and  under arms,  it  saves  me  money, on  buying  saving  cream.  my  legs  are  soft  and  smells  great.  this  product  is  all  in  one  shaving  cream  and  cleansing  conditioner,  it  is  worth  the  money  love  it</li>
            <li> I reviewed the Spring Gardenia and wasn&#x27;t overly impressed but I tried the Summer Mango Coconut and LOVE it!!!  It doesn&#x27;t have any of the menthol feel or scent of the other Wen products I&#x27;ve tried.  It has a pleasant summery suntan lotion scent which may not be for everyone, but again I love it.  The \\&quot;forumula\\&quot; is awesome.  It feels really smooth and silky even while lathering your hair.  I&#x27;ve had several people at work comment on how nice my looks since using this product.  My hair is very soft and no longer feels dry.  This has definitely been my favorite Wen so far!  Only problem is I don&#x27;t think I want that scent year round and wish it didn&#x27;t cost so much!!!  I will probably try to fall and winter scents when they become available.</li>
            <li> I liked the cleansing conditioner; it met my expectations of how good the Wen products are and I love what they do for my hair, but, the smell was not good.  The one I received only smelled like mango and it wasn&#x27;t a pleasant odor.  There was absolutely no coconut smell  to it at all and that was the one reason I wanted to try it.  There was nothing wrong with the performance of the product but I will not buy that particular scent again.</li>
            <li> I bought this product several weeks ago and was very impressed at first- my hair smelled great and felt super soft- until I noticed very large clumps of my hair falling out with continued use. I&#x27;m not talking a few small clumps, I&#x27;m talking about a clump the size of several cotton balls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only wash my hair two to three times a week and  at first I thought the excess hair loss was due to stress (I&#x27;m in graduate school and have a full time job too!) but when I switched back to a regular shampoo and conditioner this week I noticed a huge reduction in hair loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not know what is in the product that would cause excess hair loss but whatever is in it caused just that for me. I will not repurchase this product and would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I reviewed several other reviews on this product before I bought it. Many people mention that the sent is very strong and it is, but when you rinse it out after 3 minutes it seems to leave just a very faint sent. I liked it and thought it was a great choice for the summer. I have been using the WEN products now for 2 months and I like what it has done to my hair.</li>
            <li> I feel the Wen Cleanser Conditioner met my expectations.  It left my hair feeling clean and soft.  In addition, it helped maintain the color longer than when I used shampoo and condition to clean my hair.  Every ten days I lightly use a shampoo to do a thorough cleansing but I follow up with Wen and after rinsing, I use a pea size amount as a leave in conditioner.  I&#x27;m happy I found Wen.</li>
            <li> My husband loves the fact that my hair smells like coconut and mango. I love the smell of anything fruity or this purchase was a big plus. I highly recommend it to anyone</li>
            <li> I have tried several of the other scents and for my chemistry and smell sensitivities, this is the ONLY one I love.  The others are eh, but this one is fresh and stays fresh.  Should sell it all year.</li>
            <li> Best Smell ever by far! Love Wen, but this is the greatest smell. Cleans hair, leaving soft, silky and bouncy. Amazing products</li>
            <li> Now I don&#x27;t have coarse or curly hair, mine is fine, oily &amp; short, but everyone should try this method before you invest in this &#x27;cleansing conditioner&#x27;:&lt;br /&gt;In your palm put 1/2 the amount of shampoo you would normally use along with about the same amount you normally used for conditioner. Mix it together in your hands and then work it into your hair &amp; scalp, then rinse well &amp; done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My theory behind this product is that it is not magic, it just uses much less shampoo (guess we are all using too much shampoo) but it needs the conditioner to be the carrier for the shampoo which is why you have to use so much of the cream, or even wash it twice to get clean, grease free hair. I have oily hair and I would have to wash it twice with Wen to get it clean, that doesn&#x27;t make sense to use creamy conditioner twice to get my hair less oily unless it was the cleanser I was benefiting from, not the extra conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know tons of people love this product, but who can spend that much money for hair cleanser?! It&#x27;s absurd, especially if you can do the same thing at home.</li>
            <li> Smells great. Cleans my hair. Don&#x27;t miss the lather at all. Used to have to wash my hair every day or it wouldn&#x27;t do anything. Now I can skip days and my hair will style nicely and still looks great. I am now a Wen girl.</li>
            <li> Scent of summer after this long winter!  I am an avid Wen user and love it.  If you have to have suds to feel your hair is clean, this is not for you, but I guarantee you, it does clean your hair.  I have thin hair and am proof that Wen does indeed calm the frizz from drying.  Highly recommend trying at least.</li>
            <li> Smells so good and leaves my hair soft and shiny. My husband uses it and loves it too. We are on our third bottle. We noticed that all you really need is a few pumps not as many as recommended. But then again we both have short hair.</li>
            <li> Already reviewed wen kids cleanser. Love the adult formula too. Seems pricey at first, but lasts a while and worth it.</li>
            <li> Worst product ever! It was a fake!</li>
            <li> I love wen already. This is one of my favorite scents which is not currently available through wen. Glad to find it.</li>
            <li> WEN is loaded with silicones.  So if you want your hair to be weighed down after using it for long periods of time WITHOUT using any other type of shampoo or conditioner, then this is for you.  I don&#x27;t mind using WEN once in awhile, but I did the months on end trial with WEN and my hair looked like total hell.  I love the smell of Coconut Mango, but I use it sparingly.</li>
            <li> Love this summer version from WEN.  Great scent and love the results.  My hair smells great and is soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I have oily hair and have to wash daily but a bottle still lasts me over a month and my hair is well past my shoulders.</li>
            <li> I have particularly fine hair and not much of it.  My sister recommended WEN to me so I tried it, in spite of the high price. My hair had more sheen and no fly away ends...but it was even more &amp;#34;flat&#x27; than usual. I tried  the mousse is normally use but that didn&#x27;t help. So I don&#x27;t think I will not spend this much money again.... But people with thick hair will love it, I am sure!</li>
            <li> Left my hair feeling limp and oily. No volume, no luminescence, just flat, limp, and heavy like it was full of goop.</li>
            <li> My favorite. My hair feels and looks amazing.</li>
            <li> Ok, one word.....Yummy! Think pina colodas (sp?) ladies. Your hair will smell of exotic places and sexy suntanned bodies, whew, better take a sec to compose myself...........yes, its that good. For all you gals that haven&#x27;t tried Wen yet, this is a great scent to try first. Enjoy! Pass the frozen coconut adult libations, please!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Holly Nicole, Glamour Couture</li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t like this product not what its all cracked up tp be and over priced for what its supposed to do made my hair dryer was not impressed at all</li>
            <li> I  loved the scent and it exends my hair color.  Wish this was a regular product versus a seasonal promotional.</li>
            <li> Buyer beware. WEN 16 and 32oz. bottle lids are sealed. The seal must be broken to inset the pump. This product was NOT sealed - who knows what could be in this bottle. I find this extremely disgusting and unhygienic. Have already printed my return label.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and have issues with shampoos making my scalp itchy and red. I have tried everything from very expensive to really cheap for my reddish, curly, color-treated hair with limited results. I kept seeing the Wen infomerical and asked friends on FB if they had ever used it. A few had and LOVED it (they use the fig). So I went to the Wen site and ordered the Summer Mango Coconut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It arrived quickly, but after first washing (I followed the directions to a tee) my hair felt greasy. So I posted on FB again and friends said to reduce the number of pumps I was using. Tried again, hair still greasy. Third day, reduced the pumps yet again, washed and rinsed hair in cold water and the same thing. The deep conditioner they send with the shampoo is wonderful, leaves your hair very soft, but the actual shampoo is not working for me. Plus, if you actually used the exact amount of pumps they advise, you&#x27;d use up the 16oz bottle in less than 2 weeks. Way over priced and not good for wavy hair. I am returning it.</li>
            <li> I have tried several of the Wen cleansers (almond mint, pom, cucumber and pumpkin), but Mango Coconut is my favorite!!!</li>
            <li> I love the WEN hair products....this purchase was a gift as you can&#x27;t get that scent after a certain period of time.</li>
            <li> WEN Cleansing Conditioner does a great job on my hair leaving it very soft and manageable.  The only complaint I have is that I think it is too expensive.</li>
            <li> it smell so good that you feel like tasting it, it leaves your hair wonderful looking and smelling fantastic. Love it.</li>
            <li> I am  NOW and FOREVER  a WEN WOMAN! I have long, red thick curly hair. With this magic potion, I can wear my hair straight or curly. I live at the beach, and don&#x27;t even check the weather for humidity anymore. Order arrived fast! No more fern head, I&#x27;m in hair heaven!!.</li>
            <li> Wen leaves my hair full and easy to manage and I LOVE this smell!</li>
            <li> I love Wen as a conditioner, but it honestly doesn&#x27;t get my hair clean if I try to use it as a cleanser, even if I wash twice.</li>
            <li> Best flavor of Wen smells and does wanders for your hair also cheaper on Amazon</li>
            <li> This sent is one of my favorites from Wen.</li>
            <li> has a wonderful smell but it leaves my hair feeling greasy after a day which with my regular shampoo and conditoner does not</li>
            <li> I purchased this bottle hoping to get the same out come of the 1st bottle i had purchased. So I decided to purchase 2 more bottles unfortunally the 2nd purchase of this product left my hair very oily and dirty looking. Nothing like the description said.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving it!! I&#x27;ve used this a few times now and I totally understand the hype behind this product. Using this for the first time, I thought that the cream seemed really rich and I was worried it would weigh my hair down as I have really thick hair that gets oily after one day. However, I noticed that it really is a CLEANSING conditioner as I rinsed the product. My hair felt clean and not waxy. I was really impressed as my hair dried because the soft, silky texture was something I had never experienced before! I am really tempted to try the Sally&#x27;s version which is much cheaper but I don&#x27;t really want to try anything else because I love this so much. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I was so skeptical at first of this product.  I did not know what to think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love how my hair feels and so does my husband.  It is so soft and shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I see is the amount it says to use.  It says for long hair 24-32 pumps for long hair. If your hair is longer/thicker you may need to increase the amount of pumps.  Are you kidding me.  That is over the top.  I did not even use half that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I love the feel of my hair but I think they want you to use so much so you have to keep buying it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the coconut/mango for 3 weeks now and I am amazed. My hair is thick, to mid-back and colored. I have used Pantene 2 in 1 shampoo and conditioner for smooth hair and then the Pantene smooth conditioner for years. It took both to make my hair &#x27;behave&#x27;. I was skeptical about Wen. I used the recommended amount at first and found it was too much- and I have a lot of hair. Now I used somewhat less for washing and much less (only one small pump) for leave-in conditioner. It took me several washings to get it just right for my hair.  Rinsing well is mandatory. My hair behaves so well! It is smooth, soft and shiny. It is quicker/easier to take care of my hair now! It dries nicer and smells great. Most surprising of all I am losing 2/3 less hair than I was. I thought the amount of hair loss I was seeing was just normal for me. Apparently not! I love it. It is expensive, even on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It was better to buy here without having to be automatically shipped. I have very short hair and 1 bottle lasts me months.</li>
            <li> Ok I&#x27;m a guy with short hair so i&#x27;m using the least amount recommended. I&#x27;m always looking for good hair products so it was time to buy again and thought I&#x27;d try WEN. Used it once so not sure how results will be but when I got it and read the instructions it reads anywhere (depending on the length of your hair) from 10-36 pumps. What? if I did 10 full pumps I will be approaching a golf ball size ammount in my hand, that&#x27;s just a guess but one full pump size is about the size of a quarter. I&#x27; wondering if this is for real or is this a pitch for the consumer to use a lot at a time thus increasing the need to buy more more frequently. Sorry just a little skeptical. If you have very long hair and decide to do 36 full pumps good luck getting it into your hand(s).</li>
            <li> Loved the smell!  Perfect for summer time!  I personally don&#x27;t follow the directions of the product.  I use it as a conditioner and love the results.</li>
            <li> I LOVE WEN! I have very thick, curly &amp; long hair &amp; was finding that WEN was not lasting very long at all. I have been using WEN for over 2 years &amp; I have found that it works better for me if I dilute it. I mix it 1/3 water &amp; 2/3 WEN. It lasts longer and it actually works better for me this way. It is more evenly distributed &amp; works every bit as well! (After all the directions have you add water then work it through.) I add the shampoo at the beginning of my shower/bath and rinse as the very last thing! My hair never looks greasy &amp; my scalp is very healthy. I have found that with WEN I only have to wash my hair 2 or 3 times a week. ( I rarely use hair products) I hope you find this helpful!</li>
            <li> Any Wen product is worth it, I will not ever go back to regular shampoo or conditioner. Will continue to use wen products</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been watching those Wen commercials for years and always thought it was outrageously priced but still wanted to try it. I&#x27;m sold for life now. Wow! First off I have long frizzy curly/wavy psycho red color treated hair. After one use it literally worked some kind of magic on my hair. My hair was not frizzy and my natural curls were just like when I was a kid before I started dying and straightening my hair. I&#x27;ve also got my mom to use it because she was having problems with dry scalp and hair lose and it has helped all of those problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How to use it is very important. I live in the desert with horrible crappy water that is not soft. Definitely watch the video and follow the direction on massaging your scalp and rinsing your hair out. I&#x27;ve been playing around with how many pumps works for me and everyone will probably be different.  Although I was happy with this bottle I read about the fake bottles going around on Amazon. So my next purchase will be with QVC just to be safe. The deal on there is actually better for 2 bottles.</li>
            <li> My hair is to my waist &amp; it has been thinning :( ... That being said, when I received my bottle of WEN, I was excited to use it &amp; see how it holds up to the claims on the infomercial. I opted for the Summer Mango Coconut this time... I love the smell... love how soft, shiny, thick, &amp; bouncy my hair looks... AND I colored my hair well over a month ago- the color has not faded and my hair remains shiny. I am going to try the Original formula...</li>
            <li> Way too expensive and you have to use a lot of it (like 10 pumps and I have short hair). Left my hair greasy and limp. Head and shoulders works leaps and bounds better.</li>
            <li> I love Wen Cleansing conditioners.  This one has a suttle fragrance, but its not one of my favorites.. Its nice and I like it - dont get me wrong, but I&#x27;m learning that the different fragrances do provide a different result in my hair.  Lavendar and Gardenia Green Tea make my hair a little more bouncy.</li>
            <li> Love the Wen system.  Did not look at the size of this closely when purchased and is only 16oz.  Silly me.  Too expensive but would have been a waste to return.  Does smell good especially for t he summer</li>
            <li> I have fine light colored hair.  The product seems to be a bit too heavy and by the second day I feel it&#x27;s time the wash again in ordert feel clean.</li>
            <li> I had problems with the pump, but read on another website that it could be corrected by opening the pump before placing it in the bottle.</li>
            <li> I love Wen hair care products regardless - my mother says I should be a sales person! - but this scent has so far been my favorite!  It makes me long for beaches and maxi dresses.  Will definitely get more in the future!</li>
            <li> Love the summer smell</li>
            <li> Will never go back to using shampoo and conditioner again!  I will continue to replenish this product.  Thank you very much!</li>
            <li> Final Update!?&lt;br /&gt;1 Month Later:  Okay, so I&#x27;m still using this one bottle of WEN after over a month.  My hair is elbow length, medium thick, wavy, white girl hair.  It is very tangly, so I&#x27;ve always combed my hair out in the shower with regular conditioner in.  After using this for over a month, I&#x27;ve noticed a DRASTIC difference in hair loss.  I can&#x27;t believe it, because I read some reviews that said it causes hair loss, but I&#x27;ve experienced the opposite.  I was used to losing a good bit of hair, each time I washed (every other day), but in the last 3 weeks, it has come down to just 2 or 3 hairs, as opposed to about 20.  I think the people that experienced hair loss, we&#x27;re just not use to combing out their hair in the shower, and seeing how much they were actually losing all along.  Anyway... My hair looks amazing.  It&#x27;s soft, silky, smooth, and it moves around a lot.  I have volume, and it&#x27;s less tangly.  IF your hair is oily after using WEN, you&#x27;ve used it wrong.  You have to add water as you scrub, and you have to rinse it REALLY well, and that my friend will not happen again, unless you got the wrong kind for your hair.  The trick to detangling is to wait until you&#x27;re rinsing to comb out your hair.  The water helps detangle.  Don&#x27;t even try to comb it right when you just scrubbed it; wait until it&#x27;s time to rinse, after it&#x27;s absorb into the hair.  I also am not using as much as the directions say, because I still have 1/4 bottle left, and it should all be gone by now.  I am loving this product, so I&#x27;ve just ordered more in a different flavor.  Hope it is as great.  I highly recommend this product after over a month of steady use I have nothing but good things to say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 Weeks Later:&lt;br /&gt;I have used this product for 3 weeks, every other day, and I think I&#x27;m gonna keep ordering.  My hair looks great, and feels healthy.  I bought the L&#x27;Oreal cleansing conditioner to compare, and I just used it today.  It&#x27;s a great product if you can&#x27;t afford WEN, butWEN is superior.  It just doesn&#x27;t quite smooth and detangle as well.  I have not noticed a build up on my scalp or hair loss... I think rinsing extremely well is key with these cleansing conditioners.  My hair is wavy, and when I let it dry natural, I have more definition to my waves.  I have noticed more fly-aways around my part, but that may just be new hair growth since my scalp is more healthy.  My hair is consistently smooth and very soft when I blow dry it.  It&#x27;s almost like this product performs off of heat.  The key is figuring out how much product to use, how much to scrub and lather, and how long to rinse.  I have had a very good experience.  I think the people who claim to have greasy hair, are not scrubbing or rinsing long enough.  I recommend this product.  I&#x27;ll try to keep you updated!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First Use:&lt;br /&gt;So I waited for days, impatiently, and finally got the package.  I jumped into the shower, popped the pump up, pump pump pump... and fail.  The pump put out three nice pumps and broke.  A spring went flying, and I tried to fix it with one hand... but it wouldn&#x27;t fix.  Long story short, I removed the lid, squeezed out a big glob, and started massaging!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First:  Mango Coconut smells divine.  I&#x27;ve never tried the others, so I don&#x27;t know how it compares, but I love it.  It&#x27;s subtle, yet you can smell it when you turn your head.  Coconut is light, with a hint of mango, and it&#x27;s kinda vanillawee too.&lt;br /&gt;Now for the Hair:  My hair is almost to my elbows, so, following the directions and using 30 pumps, means I get to use about a third of this lil bottle each time I wash my hair :(  Pricey pricey, but thank God, it actually works.  I have always had tangly hair.  It&#x27;s not to thick, not to thin, but the strands are baby fine, and they tangle.  So I already have a comb in the shower.  To my surprise it was a little harder to comb out than it usually is with my conditioner in.  I was a little worried that it wasn&#x27;t going to do the trick.&lt;br /&gt;First thing I noticed, when I was letting it sit, and bathing... I looked down and saw a section of hair form into a perfect ringlet.  Now, my hair is wavy, but never ringlets.  So I knew something was happening.  I rinsed, jumped out, towel dried, and it definitely seemed curlier than normal.  But I wanted to make sure it wasn&#x27;t going to be all goopy and oily, so I blow dried it.  OH MY!!! My hair looked like it had been flat ironed, it was SO smooth.  I could actually see my layers, because my hair had so much movement.  It was as soft as my babies hair.  I&#x27;m actually laying down in bed typing this, and it feels like I&#x27;m laying on a satin pillow case, I kid you not!  SO, what I plan to do is keep using it, and up date my review after a little bit to make sure my hair doesn&#x27;t start falling out, or gradually get an oily build up that some complain of.  Also, I&#x27;m going to order L&#x27;oreal&#x27;s Evercreme cleansing conditioner because I read in its reviews that it does exactly the same thing for a third of the price.  And we&#x27;ll see what happens!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary:  Worked great the first time, except the pump broke (hence the 4 stars instead of 5).</li>
            <li> Smells sooooo good. Fast shipping</li>
            <li> Love It, the best smelling one so far. Once you use Wen ( any of the scents) you will never use anything else.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;I have always loved Wen because the moisturizing in it helped me to grow my hair to midback length for the first time in my life.  However, I&#x27;ve always HATED their scents. If you do not like their other scents, then definitely order this one! It is the ONLY one that smells good! Really good!&lt;br /&gt;Finally someone at Wen took notice that all their products stink...and got it right this time!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Love it..GREAT shampoo, conditioner. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It smells amazing</li>
            <li> LOVE this product.......this smells great too. Wen is all I use!!!</li>
            <li> My favorite smelling Wen to date. I love the way it makes my hair feel</li>
            <li> wen is the best cc out there and the summer mango coconut smells so yummy!!&lt;br /&gt;I totally recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I love this product, however for me I have to use shampoo to wash my hair (specially after a work out) because it doesn&#x27;t feel as clean to me; with that said I will use it occasionally as the only product to \\&quot;wash\\&quot; my hair, but I use it daily as a conditioner which helps because I have super thick/coarse hair and this product helps to tame my locks without leaving residue on my hair. I really like it for my daughter since she is not the greatest at getting all of the shampoo out of her hair. With Wen it doesn&#x27;t matter if she gets it all out or not, as it can be used as a leave in conditioner. I just ordered the kids Wen and am curious to see how that will work for her!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: it is a good overall product that is worth the money</li>
            <li> This is the second time I bought this.  The smell is the best next to the pomegranate.  I will keep ordering it and it works great!</li>
            <li> Smells Wonderful, and makes my hair very soft.. it doesn&#x27;t clarify, so you will need another product for that. Also, i didn&#x27;t need to use as much of the product as recommended. The bottle is smaller that you might imagine, so this very expensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve Ben using WEN for years now and my hair as never been healthier or prettier - except when I was younger and didn&#x27;t have stubborn grays or frequent coloring to hide said grays.  I do get cheap sometimes and try other cleansing conditioners, or new shampoos that make extravagant promises but my hair always rebels and responds only to WEN. All WEN products make my hair happy, but I&#x27;m not crazy about all the scents they offer. This scent is delicious and keeps smelling great, even if I go an extra day between cleansings (unlike one or two of the other scents).  So, I wholeheartedly recommend this product and scent. My only reservation is the cost is pretty high... But that&#x27;s partly overcome by being able to forego washing my hair everyday.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for my dry, curly hair....</li>
            <li> Smell great but no great results with conditioning.</li>
            <li> Wen is good stuff. The Summer Mango Coconut is the BEST to me.  Smells divine, and keeps my hair soft and shiny. Wen is also good for shaving my under arms and legs.  I love the product.  Chaz Dean has a winner here.  This was my first time purchasing Wen from Amazon. I just had to find my Summer Mango Coconut, which Chaz Dean only sells seasonally, so I know where to look now.  My only complaint is this did not come with a pump, as shown in the pic and it was not mentioned in the listing that there was no pump.  It&#x27;s harder to get the right amount out of the bottle having to squeeze it out and it&#x27;s cumbersome to hold while your hands are wet. Nonetheless, Amazon was great and I did receive a partial refund for the missing pump.</li>
            <li> great product, been using for almost two years now - wouldn&#x27;t go back to traditional shampoo.  Love the scent - will miss it until next summer!</li>
            <li> I switched to WEN six thirteen several months ago in an attempt to repair the damage to my hair. I have thin wavy hair that I dye every 6 to 8 weeks (I&#x27;m naturally a brunette who was meant to be a blonde). Other than that I don&#x27;t use hot irons or anything, but my hair was so dry and damaged, it felt like hay (and didn&#x27;t look much better). Over a period of about 6 months I used every conditioner, treatment, mask I could find to try and repair my hair. But by the time I got it to look half way nourished It was time to dye it again. I started using WEN and within the week my hair felt so soft and looked fantastic!! I bought the mango over the summer, as it was a seasonal item. It smells amazing. I love coconut mango anything, and this was just what the doctor ordered. I usually order from QVC, but since this isn&#x27;t available in the winter i decided to give amazon a try. glad I did. I bought 2 bottles!! In case you are wondering, this one is my favorite, six thirteen is also good. I just bought the winter vanilla mint to try and love that too. It&#x27;s tingly like the 6-13 but smells way better. I didn&#x27;t care for any of the other kinds. I know it sounds like an infomercial, but I will never go back to shampoo again! I can&#x27;t, my hair won&#x27;t let me!</li>
            <li> I tried this after seeing an info-mercial a few years ago and have used it ever since. I have naturally curly hair and this stuff is a dream for it. No more frizzies! Plus, the Mango-Coconut smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> Made my daughter&#x27;s curly hair so soft and tangle free!</li>
            <li> This product arrived on time and there were no issues with quality.  I like the smell and the consistency of this item and have reordered it a second time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to lie, I am not sure what all the hype is about this stuff. It definitely doesn&#x27;t leave my hair as they show on TV. My hair ends up greasy and looks gross. It does smell good though. :)</li>
            <li> First I wanna say that I&#x27;ve seen the commercials on Wen a lot and I was curious but scared to try it because if you leave it to what the tv says every product works lol so I honestly I didn&#x27;t try it until now because my Aunt has a very big bottle of the Fig Wen and she told me that she likes it so I decided to get a bottle not Fig because I love more tropical smells so I seen the Summer Mango and thought it would smell sexy and it does it smells so tropical and sweet it also moisturizes extremely well and cleanses very well I&#x27;m writing this because I know when you spend money you want to be happy with what you get and I want you to know it&#x27;s good it keeps you&#x27;re hair soft and it cleanses very well I hope this review helps</li>
            <li> I had to use so much of this stuff to get my hair to feel clean, it was crazy. I also definitely had to do clarifying washes with shampoos pretty frequently. The smell is divine, though.</li>
            <li> I love WEN, but this one didnt really clean my hair. I use it as conditioner. It smells great but as a shampoo - dont do it.</li>
            <li> works great and smells delish!!</li>
            <li> Umm-m-m, love the fragrance of this product and how my hair stops frizzing out after shampooing.</li>
            <li> This smelled wonderful and I&#x27;ve always loved WEN!!! Great products and would buy again and again!!! MAke PUmpkin available and this available all the time not just seasonal! :)</li>
            <li> I really like the product, just wish the bottle was the size it used to come in. A bit small.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using WEN since Dec 2011 and I&#x27;ll never use shampoo again. I am in a pool for hours a day and my hair w shampoo was course, brittle and plain nasty. Since I started using WEN, my hair is healthy, shiny, manageable and plain amazing!! I am 54 w graying, textured, curly thick hair and the WEN products are all great! I wish we could post pictures as my son, an elite swimmer, has also been using WEN since Dec 2011. The before /after photos are unbelievable!</li>
            <li> Wen is AMAZING of your trying to bring strength back to your hair.! It&#x27;s not to oily or anything. It doesnt lather like most shampoos and such, but it works. And helps hair growth</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m never buying regular shampoo again. My hair is fine, dry and frizzy but an oily scalp. I know, not a fun combo. This conditioner makes my hair silky smooth!</li>
            <li> My wife wanted to return this sub-par product which did the complete opposite of what they claimed...aka makes your hair nice and greasy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After calling to cancel the remaining shipments through their automated answering service we were told our account was canceled and we wouldn&#x27;t be charged or sent anymore product...Wrong!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next month we received another shipment and were billed again :0 So we called and cancelled again using their automated answering service. (SPOILER: their automated answer service obviously doesn&#x27;t work because we got billed again!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I decided to stay on until I spoke with a REAL PERSON (I recommend getting a good book to read while you wait.) and I eventually had the pleasure of speaking with \\&quot;Darius\\&quot; who informed me if I returned the product I would get a refund.  I fedex&#x27;d them back their product and mistakenly assumed I was done with Wen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was wrong.  Next we received a collection letter from the wonderful people over at Wen.  Funny, I assumed canceling THREE times would be enough to have them get the hint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After calling back again and waiting an hour again to speak to a live individual I was finally informed by a \\&quot;supervisor\\&quot; the account would finally be canceled and I would receive my refund. (Never do business with a company that refuses to EMAIL you a confirmation the account is canceled...they would only send it by mail.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I know they&#x27;re lying to me like they lied to me the previous three times but I&#x27;m sure at some point the Better Business Bureau will get to the bottom of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moral of the story - Useless product, even worse customer service, it&#x27;s basically a scam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t make the same mistake we did...don&#x27;t order it in the first place!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using Wen for 2 years and really like it.  I have curly hair and this really detangles.  I love this summer smell of coconut and mango.</li>
