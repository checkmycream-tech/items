            <li>it was amazing.</li>
            <li>I used the shampoo by itself and my own conditioner</li>
            <li>This shampoo has a nice scent ..</li>
            <li>It also makes a really good lather and is easy to spread around the hair.</li>
            <li>No, they don&#x27;t smell like garlic, but they do smell like flowers, very strongly.</li>

            <li>And shipping was very quick as well!</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised that the smell was very nice!</li>

            <li>For the price +shipping, it was more than affordable.</li>
            <li>&amp; I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I love the smell.</li>
            <li>i love this stuff :)</li>
            <li>Was hoping that it would prevent my hair from dropping in the shower, but I&#x27;m glad that it helps others.</li>
            <li>These products make your hair strong,give a shiny and healthy look.</li>
            <li>I looked it up on Amazon and thought what do I got to lose (more hair).</li>
            <li>It also made it fall out even more.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell like garlic, more of an institutional smell.</li>
            <li>this time for me :)</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>Much improved!!!!</li>
            <li>It helped with minor hairs loss for both my hubby and I, it is awesome</li>
            <li>I feel a difference in the thickness of my hair, but not as great as I had hoped for.&lt;br /&gt;Going to give it more time to see a complete difference.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for about 3 months now I wanted to wait and order one more bottle of each to really give it a good review.  </li>
            <li>this product is amazing and well worth the price...</li>
            <li>the scent alone incredible, my (our) hair is full and lush - i&#x27;m 54 and have about 8 grays...</li>
            <li>Not harsh and buy it having this garlic name I thought it would at lease smell like a lil garlic, the smell is Outstanding Good.</li>
            <li>which is fine for me.</li>
            <li>Follow the directions &amp; during the conditioning part, I do not like the way my hair feels, but after I rinse &amp; get out of the shower, it feels fine, so don&#x27;t freak out if that happens to you.</li>
            <li>your hair look silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>after using this, i had baby hair growing out..and smells good, made my hair soft...</li>
            <li>It has a strong, sweet baby powder-ish fragrance that lingers for days in my hair.</li>
            <li>I used weekly and still noticed significant benefit.  </li>
            <li>but my hair feel really clean.</li>
            <li>I was losing hair by the fist full</li>
            <li>The instructions for optimum results require almost daily washing (not an option for me).  </li>
            <li>The smell is strong at first, but you can get used to it.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t reorder, but quickly decided I needed the shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I ended up shaving my head but continued to use this shampoo, my hair thicken up so quickly, but I thought it was because I have shaved my head.</li>
            <li>But it is well worth it.</li>
            <li>I was told to buy a different kind of garlic shampoo from friends that said it worked to grow hair</li>
            <li>It was worth a try</li>
            <li>BACK NICE</li>
            <li>Seems to be okay so far, it does not irritate my scalp.</li>
            <li>I was afraid it would smell funny, but surprisingly has a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>so far so good its only been 2 weeks</li>
            <li>MY HAIR IS NICE AND HEALTHY NOW AND GOT THICK AND IS GROWING</li>
            <li>My hair is more resilient, thicker, shinier and above all healthier.</li>
            <li>biggest thing I want people who are looking at this shampoo to know, it that is most definitely NOT unscented.  </li>
            <li>After the first use I could tell the difference in the the feel of my hair</li>
            <li>I stopped using this product because I just wanted something that smelled better; all of my hair started falling out again, I started back using this immediately..</li>
            <li>Overall love this product</li>
            <li>I also did not use it consistently.</li>
            <li>I am super excited about this product and will be back again!</li>
            <li>My hair grew back to its original thickness within 4 days!</li>
            <li>Makes my hair feel so clean and soft.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair soft manageable and clean.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised at how long the scent lingered in my hair - it honestly gave me a headache.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li>i know, sounds kinda crazy, but this is the best stuff on the market - oh, and if your hair is thinning?</li>
            <li>When received the bottle of the shampoo had so much dust on it as it was sitting on shelves for years for that reason</li>
            <li>I think it works very well and would tell friends all about this product indeed</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast arrived to Kansas in 2 days (Prime Member) and in a save box&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product did absolutely nothing for me.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really see a difference.  </li>
            <li>This product really dries out my hair, strips the color and makes it very course.</li>
            <li>It mostly just dried out my scalp and hair - the conditioner was not very nourishing, it honestly just feels like another lather of shampoo when I apply</li>
            <li>I have super long hair (almost to my lower back) and combing my hair seemed to get more tangles with this.</li>
            <li>I have only used it three times so far, but my hair feels nice and clean &amp; I think I&#x27;m seeing less hair in the drain &amp; on my clothes!</li>
            <li>Pleasant smell and very thick creamy conditioner.  </li>
            <li>see less hair shedding this is a most for the winter</li>
            <li>Since using the garlic shampoo and conditioner my hair seem to gain more elasticity, fulness, and less shedding with patience and time.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>For hair loss, I highly recomment.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s normal to shed from 70 to 100 hairs a day.</li>
            <li>On a positive note, the benefit seemed to last for weeks after I stopped using it; therefore, I am considering using it once every 4 weeks (have to really weigh pros and cons).  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair, which is fine, very soft but not weighed down.</li>
            <li>It is a heavy, cheap floral smell.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t find that it did much for me overall.</li>
            <li>So naturally I google home remedies...</li>
            <li>makes hair soft.</li>
            <li>and i used the conditioner frequently</li>
            <li>Also, as far as the seller, my package arrived on time &amp; they have the cheapest price I could find.</li>
            <li>I decided even though I have a TON of tangles to DRY my hair FIRST before I combed it out.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re standing still and tons of hair is coming out, you&#x27;re most likely having excessive shedding and should consult your doctor.</li>
            <li>Overall okay, not sure if I would purchase again.</li>
            <li>I have tried other products but this is the one that has really worked for my hair.</li>
            <li>the shampoo and conditioner are bright pink, I thought this meant it was fake, but this is what color it&#x27;s meant to be.&lt;br /&gt;These also are not unscented.</li>
            <li>Very drying product , killed my curls and took away luster of my natural hair .</li>
            <li>it&#x27;ll bring it back to thick over a small amount of time - my hair has never looked better!</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t see as much hair falling out, and there is significantly less in the shower.</li>

            <li> , I don&#x27;t see as much hair falling out, and there is significantly less in the shower.</li>
            <li> but it was really after the first week and a half that I started noticing less hair in my brush everyday.  </li>
            <li> While I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s helping the problem, it&#x27;s gentle and is unscented.  </li>
            <li> Long story short</li>
            <li> I have stopped using but only because it caused some acne (I can be sensitive to anything I put in my hair or on my skin so not sure this is product related and if anyone else would experience the same).  </li>
            <li> The only thing is it does dry up the hair.</li>
            <li> It was like when your grandma loses her sense of smell &amp; puts on a whole bottle of perfume.</li>
            <li> I have used the conditioner in the past, and it leaves my hair soft and manageable.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I have done a lot of research on trying to keep my hair. I was getting a little scared about a year ago, and I started taking rogaine. I did not like taking it because it says if you STOP taking it your hair will fall out. Well that stuff is too expensive to and too time consuming for me and I didn&#x27;t want to take that chance of not feel like taking it and my hair falling out. I decided to try the garlic shampoo and conditioner. This shampoo and conditioner works great and doesn&#x27;t smell like garlic. I use it every other day, and that&#x27;s about it. I also stopped using hair sprays and started using Extra Virgin Olive Oil mixed with Castrol Oil and that has been working for me. The shampoo is a big help though</li>
            <li> The shampoo/conditioner combo stopped my excessive shedding (due to health issues that have been recently rectified) in its tracks. For the price +shipping, it was more than affordable. I&#x27;d recommend this product over pricey alternatives. Please note: it&#x27;s normal to shed from 70 to 100 hairs a day. If you&#x27;re standing still and tons of hair is coming out, you&#x27;re most likely having excessive shedding and should consult your doctor. These products are topical, and won&#x27;t fix any underlying issues you might be having. But if you&#x27;re just looking for something that will do what it says it will (for me, it&#x27;s to tide my over until my hair fall catches up with my current healthiness, which will take three months, as our hair represents where we were three months prior), then this is the product for you. Do follow the directions!</li>
            <li> This product  works awesome! It continues to help  my hair be stronger and have great shine! It leaves my hair, which is fine, very soft but not weighed down. It smells wonderful, no garlic smell by the way! The price is right, and the service is great!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a week &amp; I absolutely love it. I can feel my hair getting silkier &amp; thicker. I love the smell. The only thing is it does dry up the hair. But it is well worth it.</li>
            <li> I love this product: both the garlic shampoo&amp;conditioner have been a miracle for my hair! I had to order it because my hair was falling out due to excessive dying.I have been using both the shampoo and conditioner for almost a month now and the results are simply amazing. My hair is more resilient, thicker, shinier and above all healthier. I have tried other products but this is the one that has really worked for my hair.</li>
            <li> this product is amazing and well worth the price... the scent alone incredible, my (our) hair is full and lush - i&#x27;m 54 and have about 8 grays... and, it helps our little dog phoebe with fleas... i know, sounds kinda crazy, but this is the best stuff on the market - oh, and if your hair is thinning? it&#x27;ll bring it back to thick over a small amount of time - my hair has never looked better! i love this stuff :)</li>
            <li> Conditioner is super watery, both items smell good  but unsure if it&#x27;s helped with hairless yet.</li>
            <li> It helped with minor hairs loss for both my hubby and I, it is awesome cos it has no garlic smell. The conditioner worked well too.</li>
            <li> Hi    i bought this product because my hair is falling around 150 strips per day .so i  bought this product and i use it (inspite of its bad smell and make my hair worst) only to readuse hair fall .but it doesnt work .totaly waste of money</li>
            <li> For now, I&#x27;m giving it three stars.  I know I need to give it time to see if it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest thing I want people who are looking at this shampoo to know, it that is most definitely NOT unscented.  I have to wonder if the company&#x27;s interpretation of unscented is that it doesn&#x27;t smell like garlic.  I didn&#x27;t smell garlic at all, but the smell is horrendous!  It is a heavy, cheap floral smell.  I used both the shampoo and conditioner and I gave myself a headache smelling this scent on me for the rest of the day.  It got to the point where I could taste it.  Yuck!  I used the shampoo by itself and my own conditioner and it wasn&#x27;t nearly as bad.  I can tolerate that combination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will review further after giving it time to see if it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do with preventing hair from falling out.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find that it did much for me overall. It mostly just dried out my scalp and hair - the conditioner was not very nourishing, it honestly just feels like another lather of shampoo when I apply it.&lt;br /&gt;The smell was also not very pleasant. It has a strong, sweet baby powder-ish fragrance that lingers for days in my hair. I was surprised at how long the scent lingered in my hair - it honestly gave me a headache.&lt;br /&gt;At this point, I&#x27;m just trying to use it up so it doesn&#x27;t sit around and go to waste. Was hoping that it would prevent my hair from dropping in the shower, but I&#x27;m glad that it helps others.</li>
            <li> I feel a difference in the thickness of my hair, but not as great as I had hoped for.&lt;br /&gt;Going to give it more time to see a complete difference.</li>
            <li> Very drying product , killed my curls and took away luster of my natural hair .</li>
            <li> When received the bottle of the shampoo had so much dust on it as it was sitting on shelves for years for that reason I did not use it cuz it could be expired and cause damages ... Seller does false advertisement t</li>
            <li> I like it a lot.  These products make your hair strong,give a shiny and healthy look.I have to wait to see if it will help to grow hair on the thinning spots,but it definitely helps to stop the hair loss.</li>
            <li> very nice product, smells great! I think it works very well and would tell friends all about this product indeed</li>
            <li> I had been going through some stress and the bald spot resulted from that (I&#x27;m guessing). So naturally I google home remedies...and I came across this shampoo. I looked it up on Amazon and thought what do I got to lose (more hair). Within 2 weeks or so my hair started to grow back. I wish I would have taken pictures of my bald spot to include it here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another story: my brother (April 2015) had a picture taken of himself and I noticed he had a bald spot growing. I sent him a message about this shampoo. He bought it, needless to say, less than a month of him using it, his hair has grown back. I want to use his pictures but he may not like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t hesitate on this purchase if you are losing hair. This works!!!</li>
            <li> I just started using the shampoo, so I can&#x27;t quantify its effectiveness at this time. I have used the conditioner in the past, and it leaves my hair soft and manageable. The conditioner has a very nice fragrance.</li>
            <li> Shampoo delivers good quality hair thickner. I did notice my thin hair a bit fuller and i see less hair on my brush.</li>
            <li> Well it did stop my hair from falling out and I&#x27;am only 26! Do as the directions say and it worked for me. However dont expect for your hair to GROW back or anything. It just stopped mine from falling out which is fine for me. Just wish it would grow back</li>
            <li> I bought this because I have been experiencing some hair fall due to a medicine I have been taking. I have been eyeing this for a while, and finally decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;Both the shampoo and conditioner are bright pink, I thought this meant it was fake, but this is what color it&#x27;s meant to be.&lt;br /&gt;These also are not unscented. No, they don&#x27;t smell like garlic, but they do smell like flowers, very strongly. The smell does fade from your hair through out the day though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this a little over a week now, and it has helped slightly, I don&#x27;t see as much hair falling out, and there is significantly less in the shower.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel so clean and soft. Not harsh and buy it having this garlic name I thought it would at lease smell like a lil garlic, the smell is Outstanding Good.</li>
            <li> Giving it 2 stars because i havent seen any improvement, if anything my hair is getting thinner, idk maybe it isnt for me or im just pissed but i will continue to use it to see what happens...</li>
            <li> My hair was shedding at an alarming rate, so I bought this combo  in addition to some hair vitamins.  After 2 months my hair is fuller  and shedding has slowed.  I&#x27;m going to purchase again and supplement  with a deep conditioner with garlic.  The product has made a big enough   impact that I&#x27;ll buy again.  Hope that with addition of deep conditioner  my shedding will further cease.</li>
            <li> I was really very skeptical about using this product. I was told to buy a different kind of garlic shampoo from friends that said it worked to grow hair but I could not afford the $60. I paid under $20 for the set of shampoo and conditioner. After the first use I could tell the difference in the the feel of my hair but it was really after the first week and a half that I started noticing less hair in my brush everyday.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Had a friend give me the set and used it up.  I didn&#x27;t reorder, but quickly decided I needed the shampoo.  It definitely deters the lose of hair.  Plus it makes my hair shiny and managable.  For hair loss, I highly recomment.</li>
            <li> so far so good its only been 2 weeks</li>
            <li> only shampoo i use on me and my 3 girls. makes hair soft. i cant get this in my area so it is nice to be able to get it on here and have it delivered to my door.</li>
            <li> This shampoo made my hair very hard. It also made it fall out even more.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in hair loss and been using for a month, and the scent is unpleasant to me. Doesn&#x27;t smell like garlic, more of an institutional smell. It was worth a try</li>
            <li> Works great for stopping hair from falling out so much.&lt;br /&gt;Product does what it says.&lt;br /&gt;No garlic oder, just great looking hair and feels really good.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast arrived to Kansas in 2 days (Prime Member) and in a save box&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I bought these for my mother who was having issues with shedding hair and thinning hair and after at least a month I can tell a difference and they also smell really good not like Garlic but I will be purchasing again but this time for me :)</li>
            <li> after using this, i had baby hair growing out..and smells good, made my hair soft...but what happen to the 25% bonus!! i do want the 20oz ... 16 oz just seems too expensive for me...</li>
            <li> Is too expensive on Amazon</li>
            <li> I purchased this and i used the conditioner frequently but the shampoo ever 2 weeks. I am Black so I dont wash my hair every day. I would use the conditioner about three times a week and my shedding never stopped. This could be as a result of me living in a hard water area. I dont know. But it Did nothing for me</li>
            <li> This product did absolutely nothing for me. Dissapointed.</li>
            <li> This shampoo has a nice scent ..not at all what I expected. I just started using it ,so I dont know if it works.</li>
            <li> Came very quick works great</li>
            <li> My workplace requires we use unscented products. I bought this because I thought it was unscented. The smell was unbearable. It was like when your grandma loses her sense of smell &amp; puts on a whole bottle of perfume.</li>
            <li> this brand isnt as good as the queen helene garlic shampoo and conditioner. I thought it wouldve been a bit thicker consistency. It also leaves my hair very very dry. Almost too brittle to comb or even finger detangle after I wash and condition.</li>
            <li> If I could give them a thousand stars I would! I started using this product back in June 2014. I was experiencing excessive hair loss after a deployment, so much so that if I haven&#x27;t treated it I would have been bald within a few months. I ended up shaving my head but continued to use this shampoo, my hair thicken up so quickly, but I thought it was because I have shaved my head. Long story short I stopped using this product because I just wanted something that smelled better; all of my hair started falling out again, I started back using this immediately.. My hair grew back to its original thickness within 4 days! I love this product! And shipping was very quick as well!</li>
            <li> This work!&lt;br /&gt;I see less hair shedding this is a most for the winter time.&lt;br /&gt;help your hair look silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> I have been losing a ton of hair when I wash my hair out. I bought the Nutrine shampoo and conditioner. I was pleasantly surprised that the smell was very nice! It also makes a really good lather and is easy to spread around the hair. I have super long hair (almost to my lower back) and combing my hair seemed to get more tangles with this. I decided even though I have a TON of tangles to DRY my hair FIRST before I combed it out. It seriously did the trick! I couldn&#x27;t believe it. I had almost NO HAIR in my brush it was amazing. I am super excited about this product and will be back again!</li>
            <li> Since using the garlic shampoo and conditioner my hair seem to gain more elasticity, fulness, and less shedding with patience and time. Overall love this product</li>
            <li> Just started using it. I don&#x27;t see change yet but my hair feel really clean. My hair usually looks greasy after a day but not anymore!</li>
            <li> The smell is strong at first, but you can get used to it. It works wonders!!!! I was losing hair by the fist full, now it&#x27;s a couple hairs at a time. Much improved!!!!</li>
            <li> I get this product for my mom who is having an issue with hair loss.  While I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s helping the problem, it&#x27;s gentle and is unscented.  We&#x27;ve heard garlic shampoo helps with hair loss, so we hope that it will help.</li>
            <li> I wish I have fount this product out sooner.  Leaves hair soft manageable and clean.  Pleasant smell and very thick creamy conditioner.  I purchase this product because it said to help stop shedding and yes I have seem less shedding.  I have been using it fr about a month and hair has grown about 1/2 inch with shedding.</li>
            <li> The worst shampoo! Didn&#x27;t work for me. Made my hair thinner</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about 3 months now I wanted to wait and order one more bottle of each to really give it a good review.  Not impress at all the smell is great, but it didn&#x27;t served it&#x27;s purpose I saw no difference on my hair strength and it was still falling when I showered.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT. MY HAIR IS NICE AND HEALTHY NOW AND GOT THICK AND IS GROWING BACK NICE.. I WOULD BUY THIS AGAIN. WORKS GREAT FOR ME</li>
            <li> I was afraid it would smell funny, but surprisingly has a pleasant scent. Purchased to halt weakening of and hair loss. Seems to be okay so far, it does not irritate my scalp. The conditioner does not have the &amp;#34;slippy&amp;#34; feel that I am accustomed to in conditioners. Overall okay, not sure if I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> This product works but a few things to note.  The instructions for optimum results require almost daily washing (not an option for me).  I used weekly and still noticed significant benefit.  I have stopped using but only because it caused some acne (I can be sensitive to anything I put in my hair or on my skin so not sure this is product related and if anyone else would experience the same).  On a positive note, the benefit seemed to last for weeks after I stopped using it; therefore, I am considering using it once every 4 weeks (have to really weigh pros and cons).  If I do try, I will update review.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really see a difference.  I also did not use it consistently.</li>
            <li> I like this shampoo and conditioner. It smells great. I have only used it three times so far, but my hair feels nice and clean &amp; I think I&#x27;m seeing less hair in the drain &amp; on my clothes! Follow the directions &amp; during the conditioning part, I do not like the way my hair feels, but after I rinse &amp; get out of the shower, it feels fine, so don&#x27;t freak out if that happens to you. Also, as far as the seller, my package arrived on time &amp; they have the cheapest price I could find. I will be buying again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s helping our hair be stronger and grow again</li>
            <li> I color my hair. This product really dries out my hair, strips the color and makes it very course. I do not use it anymore.</li>
