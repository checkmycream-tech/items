            <li>and I&#x27;m really satisfied with it!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>My favorite go-to product!</li>
            <li>I will purchase this again love it!</li>
            <li>and I love this pore filler!  </li>
            <li>Keep this in your stash for sure!</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li>This product is ok to me, not bad but not the best.  </li>
            <li>Great &amp; Quick shipping!</li>
            <li>makes your face feel amazing</li>
            <li>Absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to blend it in and watch it all disappear.  </li>
            <li>so I can give my honest opinion...</li>
            <li>This pore filler is absolutely the best on the market in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>I could immediately sense a wonderful smoothness as I applied it, and I felt that my skin looked much fresher.</li>
            <li>but honestly you do not need it.</li>
            <li>This is not as great as POREfessional, but it is still really pretty good.</li>
            <li>i think this is a great tool cover up your large pores!!</li>
            <li>A great trick for this is when you are done putting on foundation put this on lightly over it on huge pore areas!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased this product in stores, but Amazon offers the best price.  </li>
            <li>The product is good but doesn&#x27;t easily spread so you may be using more than is needed, I feel it should be more saturated.</li>
            <li>Be sure you are applying correctly though, it&#x27;s very easy to displace primers and pore fillers if you are buffing foundation into your face.</li>
            <li>I have a medium/dark complexion, and this applies very light.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very good and affordable primer, not oily, and leaves your  skin very natural and silky!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Goes on very smooth.</li>
            <li>I bought this, at the recommendation of my stylist friend, to fill in my fine lines and it works amazing.</li>
            <li>and I have to make sure I am using my magnification mirror  to make sure this isn&#x27;t happening.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Im in love with tthis product.  </li>
            <li>It does what it claims and more.</li>
            <li>After a  16hr day im oil free!</li>
            <li>The filler from Sephora The POREfessional is so much better. .</li>
            <li>the product is ok but for this price there is barley something in that tube.</li>
            <li>It was a good price, it does the trick I guess, but just not crazy about it.  </li>
            <li>This primer is ok.</li>
            <li>Works better and is a lot cheaper than the stuff I was buying from Clinique.</li>
            <li>Plus, they are cruelty free, which is non-negotiable to me!</li>
            <li>and I love this filler.</li>
            <li>and I will be buying more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure but don&#x27;t expect this to be a miracle cream like Miracle Blur.</li>
            <li>It gives me a nice smooth finish</li>
            <li>Love NYX products.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love most NYX products, and this one works well.  </li>
            <li>theres sumthing better  </li>
            <li>im sure</li>
            <li>and they look so much better and even when I use it as a primer before my foundation</li>
            <li>but I love it.</li>
            <li>I recommend spending more and going with Pores</li>
            <li>My pores are not horrible, and are most noticeable on the cheeks closest to my nose, and my nose.</li>
            <li>it helps your decision, my skin is fair/light, and gets the most oils around my nose during the summer months (no surprise there).</li>
            <li>It also didn&#x27;t fill in wrinkles, just sat on top of them</li>
            <li>I love the texture and silky feel of this product.</li>
            <li>I have big pores and this works wonderfully.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>I love NYX products.</li>
            <li>Face feels nice and smooth after application.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s ok ..</li>
            <li>I used to use Benefit - POREfessional, but when I needed to budget myself better I started using NYX and e.l.f. products.</li>
            <li>No, it won&#x27;t actually fill in every pore flawlessly, but what it does  is&lt;br /</li>
            <li>and I have to say I love it.  </li>
            <li>Love luv it.</li>
            <li>I really love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Might as well invest in something better.</li>
            <li>I love the way it goes on, I love how it feels and looks.</li>
            <li>I purchased this on a whim, and I&#x27;m really glad I did.</li>
            <li>This product is okay.</li>
            <li>Love love love love!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Wish</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>and I can see myself having to buy it more often.</li>
            <li>but once it&#x27;s distributed it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li>NYX&#x27;s Pore Filler does a pretty good job of filling pores and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin like Maybelline&#x27;s Baby Skin.  </li>
            <li>I am satisfied and overly excited regarding many products for this line.  </li>
            <li>The instant pore coverage is very good.</li>
            <li>On a whim, I tried this product because so many wrote it made a huge difference.</li>
            <li>got here early and it worked great.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast so that&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>Although it spreads easily, squeezing it out of the tube it sort of shoots out, like</li>
            <li>You can easily put makeup under or over it.</li>
            <li>would think my pores are fine ..</li>
            <li>but this worked great and does not dry out your skin.</li>
            <li>Seems to do just fine.</li>
            <li>fantastic will be reordering soon.</li>
            <li>SMOOTH EVEN SKIN.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>happy it the same day.  </li>
            <li>My foundation goes on really smooth and spreads like butter.  </li>
            <li>Once applied on my skin the texture is smooth, with a powdery/matte finish.</li>
            <li>This product makes my skin UNBELIEVABLY smooth- like powdered silk.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and is invisible whether you use it alone or under foundation.</li>
            <li>This product glides over your skin, filling in the pores and allows foundation to go on as though you had smooth skin.  </li>
            <li>It make my skin look smooth.</li>
            <li>I then apply this and it makes my face smooth and minimizes pores.</li>
            <li>It has a silky smooth texture.</li>
            <li>It also seems to show a film when dusted lightly with powder.</li>
            <li>well this did the trick, who would have known something so cheap</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great if you were to use this on its own but doesn&#x27;t do much when you put makeup over it, even after letting it dry.</li>
            <li>it is quick and easy.</li>
            <li>I usually just use it on my cheeks and nose under my foundation or BB cream, and it blends so well with my makeup and makes my skin look flawless.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not magic, but it&#x27;s impressive.  </li>
            <li>(large pores mostly)</li>
            <li>The pore filler arrived quickly and I was excited.  </li>
            <li>Good for oily areas such as t-zone.  </li>
            <li>i love this stuff so much</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t do that good of a job at filling my pores as it wasn&#x27;t opaque enough...</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this one.</li>
            <li>Obviously my face isn&#x27;t startlett flawless but its close enough</li>
            <li>OK, when I look in the mirror in NATURAL light, I see everything.</li>
            <li>okay enough but not her favorite product.</li>
            <li>But if you&#x27;re looking for something that won&#x27;t irritate more sensitive skin and that is a long the vein of Porefessional, this is probably a good fit.</li>
            <li>&gt; pretty much instantly smooth out your face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not the magic pill, but I can&#x27;t live without it as a part of my makeup artillery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a very soft velvety feel but it did not help my pores look any better.</li>
            <li>This product really works wonders!!</li>
            <li>Works good on my facediesnt cover everything but makes pore look less noticeable so that works good enough for me</li>
            <li>Use this smooth cream filler to &amp;#34;fill&amp;#34; in large pores, pitted scars, and watch your skin even out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a smooth silky feel, and hides large pore immediately.</li>
            <li>This is  a very light-weight product, it does fill in pores and leaves face matted so that makeup goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>This pore filler is amazing, very silky, makes my face soft, and, does the job of filling my pores.</li>
            <li>Well worth the investment</li>
            <li>My make-up stays fresh looking through out the day.</li>
            <li>It provides beautiful, long lasting pore coverage, couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with the results, especially for the price!</li>
            <li>I have large pores and am always looking for the right product, so I really wanted to love this, but for the price I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li>, however I do notice a caking up if  my application isn&#x27;t just right.</li>
            <li>But seems to work all right once it&#x27;s on.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it on the backs of my hands on special occasions to make my hands look so much younger&lt;</li>
            <li>I have very large pores and have not run across any &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; product to date.</li>
            <li>I had some issues with the first bottle that I received but this seller replaced it right away</li>
            <li>it just kind of dried my skin and made it look like I had put on cheap cakey makeup.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a lot of primers and this is just as great as primers more expensive</li>
            <li>I used this for the first time to compare it to POREfessional by Benefit.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to find anything else that actually fills in pores like it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li>Being a first time user of this product I based my purchase on reading the reviews and being a lover of NYX products.</li>
            <li>As a avid makeup buyer/lover.</li>
            <li>First of all, I was diagnosed with cystic acne at age 35.</li>
            <li>just bought another even though I&#x27;m still not done with my first buy.</li>
            <li>This product won&#x27;t diminish the appearance of pores entirely, but it will cause your skin to look more</li>
            <li>The actual product was okay.</li>
            <li>This received a stellar review from beautypedia</li>
            <li>Feels light and soft on your face.  </li>
            <li>This is a very concentrated and effective base to wear under your foundation, and the results are wonderful, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Love this product, will definitely be a continued purchase on my list.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t notice that it makes my skin look super smooth or makes my makeup last too much longer.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried much more expensive products that have not given me as good a result as this.</li>
            <li>Not super amazing.</li>
            <li>so when I use it my face is super soft.  </li>
            <li>By the way I do not have large pores.</li>
            <li>Blend it in well, and it does just what it is designed to do; fill large pores.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think my pores are that large, but this still didn&#x27;t seem to make any difference.  </li>
            <li>My pores are large all over my face.</li>
            <li>It goes on matte and helps fill my large pores.</li>
            <li>I have oily skin and large pores in the T Zone area.  </li>
            <li>I have large pores on my checks and quite a bit of redness.</li>
            <li>So if you have semi large pores it will definetly help.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 48 with large pores , oily skin, and sun</li>
            <li>My pores are rather large, this worked well on some areas of my face.</li>
            <li>I tried to take in consideration that I have large pores.</li>
            <li>I have large pores and some acne scarring.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It did not reduce my fairly LARGE pores.</li>
            <li>Sadly I have HUGE pores, so this doesn&#x27;t do the trick on the large ones but it covers up the smalls ones pretty good</li>
            <li>It still does not completely make my face look smooth, especially under makeup, but it is better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I would certainly say it reduced my pore size but not as much as as Z Pore, that I&#x27;ve  been using.</li>
            <li>Now, my makeup looks HD ready, and those large pores on my nose are gone.  </li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t really help minimize the large pores.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have huge pores but this product definitely did not fill whatever pores I do have.</li>
            <li>thanks 👌</li>
            <li>I am very oily...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shipping was really fast</li>
            <li>highly recommend this and the seller!</li>
            <li>Thought I&#x27;d give this a try since I seem to really like this brand.</li>
            <li>, I feel this really helps in hiding the pore size.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>If you apply too much, you may have this problem.  </li>
            <li>Thanks, Amazon</li>
            <li>Shipped fast.</li>
            <li>I expected more from a RuPaul-endorsed product.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t really expect much</li>
            <li>but this worked really well.</li>
            <li>You have to be careful sometimes when you sqeeze this tube more comes out though.</li>
            <li>I expected that it would be creamy, more like a primer or even a foundation-type consistency.  </li>
            <li>Really doesnt cover much at all.</li>
            <li>so I could really judge the difference.</li>
            <li>but it drys really fast</li>
            <li>I got a sample of Hourglass Makeup Primer that I really like</li>
            <li>Fills pours very well.</li>
            <li>duh it dosnt claim to me but for the time it is on its a god send it looks and feels so good.</li>
            <li>WOW!!!</li>
            <li>and I live in florida and have very oily skin in the t-zone area!</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t make all your pores disappear, particularly if you have some large ones as I do.</li>
            <li>Yes, the bottle is small, but you need just a little amount to get the job done and it works perfectly.  </li>
            <li>I probably have about 12 significant deep crater scars.</li>
            <li>Fills in pores for the most part, sometimes I feel like it doesn&#x27;t work as well as it does other times.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not really thick but not thin like using Monistat Soothing Care</li>
            <li>I have pretty sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It dried out very quick on my nose as well!  </li>
            <li>I was a bit skeptical when I first ordered this, but it is amazing!</li>
            <li>I do have older skin ( 58yrs )</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it didn&#x27;t particularly work for me.</li>
            <li>Really don&#x27;t plan to spend money on expensive sephora brands when NYX is so great.</li>
            <li>i highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I read the reviews on this item before I purchased it and had high hopes.</li>
            <li>But overall I think it&#x27;s worth buying and using as a cheaper pore filler.  </li>
            <li>I feel that only minimal touch ups are required later in the day and that for me makes this product a good one.</li>
            <li>Makes large pores less noticeable as well as some acne scars and light wrinkles.</li>
            <li>and I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>/&gt; Very soft silky feel on skin, not greasy.  </li>
            <li>The first time I tried it left build up on my nose.</li>
            <li>Yes, it is a small tube, but certainly a much better deal at&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have pretty big visible pores</li>
            <li>Maybe it will work better for a person with small pores.</li>
            <li>As many reviewers have pointed out, this is not a magic filler.</li>
            <li>Magic in a small tube.</li>
            <li>Great - not greasy or thick, really smooths my face without feeling heavy.</li>
            <li>i used the more expensive benefit counter pore minimizer, which i loved, but this one works just as well and is under half the price !</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m Asian, olive toned with large pores on my T-zone area.</li>
            <li>I have large pores on my nose and this product when applied in just a tiny amount made them invisible.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend if your pores are that large and definitely if you have redness.</li>
            <li>If you have large pores this product is nothing short of a miracle worker.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a lot of wrinkles, just a few fine lines and this product completely covers them up.</li>
            <li>If I need to suggest I would say this one was a old one</li>
            <li>I used to be an Urban Decay girl, but this is all so much easier on the wallet.</li>
            <li>NYC rocks as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
            <li>This is really just a simple silicone-y pate.</li>
            <li>So far this is the 1st pore filler I have tried.</li>
            <li>I am 34 years old</li>
            <li>maybe it&#x27;s old and separating?</li>
            <li>As far as a &#x27;pore&#x27; filler goes - yes noticeably fills small-med pores.</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s just ok, no different than any other primer I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li>I was looking for a new primer after I used up all of my bare minerals primer.  </li>
            <li>I have to wait a few minutes for this to dry before I can apply my makeup, but it does help my makeup not sink into my pores and look much more natural.</li>
            <li>I had read the reviews and already understood that this was a small amount of product, so I apply this only on areas that my pores are more noticeable.</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;m older, I only rinse my face with water in the morning.</li>
            <li>but I had no previous acne problems before this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a bit pricey for a small package, but the trick is to only layer it where you need it most.</li>
            <li>No More, unless you just want something cheap for shine control.</li>
            <li>( I wear my makeup for long periods of time too, like a whole day) and it wasn&#x27;t a problem</li>
            <li>Very silky and doesn&#x27;t pill-up with 2nd application or if using over foundation which was applied earlier in day.  </li>
            <li>I use this everyday to help moisturizer and foundation quickly absorb and set.</li>
            <li>Overall it is a good, not perfect product.</li>
            <li>Only 4 stars because it does not go very far</li>
            <li>However, I am not sure if it makes a significant difference to my appearance.</li>
            <li>The price is great and works just as wekk as smashbox and other expensive pore primers.</li>
            <li>I have large pores, and this didn&#x27;t seem to do what expected...</li>
            <li>Helps with damaged skin large or open pores it helps give ur face a great base for ur makeup</li>
            <li>I could get it in a bigger size, makes my face so soft.</li>
            <li>not sure if this was the true cause,</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use on drier or normal areas or it will feel too dry.  </li>
            <li>Leaves face smooth and a good base for makeup!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not yet completely convinced if I&#x27;ll repurchase, I have a lot of product left, but I&#x27;d definitely consider it!</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t completely camouflage your pores, especially the larger ones, but it does reduce appearance.  </li>
            <li>but it costs $30 for half as much.</li>
            <li>I found that this product was not as good as Clinique&#x27;s instant perfector in the color &amp;#34;light,&amp;#34; and Clinique was less expensive.</li>

            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> My favorite go-to product!</li>
            <li> I will purchase this again love it!</li>
            <li> and I love this pore filler!  </li>
            <li> Keep this in your stash for sure!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li> This product is ok to me, not bad but not the best.  </li>
            <li> Great &amp; Quick shipping!</li>
            <li> makes your face feel amazing</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to blend it in and watch it all disappear.  </li>
            <li> so I can give my honest opinion...</li>
            <li> This pore filler is absolutely the best on the market in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> I could immediately sense a wonderful smoothness as I applied it, and I felt that my skin looked much fresher.</li>
            <li> but honestly you do not need it.</li>
            <li> This is not as great as POREfessional, but it is still really pretty good.</li>
            <li> i think this is a great tool cover up your large pores!!</li>
            <li> A great trick for this is when you are done putting on foundation put this on lightly over it on huge pore areas!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this product in stores, but Amazon offers the best price.  </li>
            <li> The product is good but doesn&#x27;t easily spread so you may be using more than is needed, I feel it should be more saturated.</li>
            <li> Be sure you are applying correctly though, it&#x27;s very easy to displace primers and pore fillers if you are buffing foundation into your face.</li>
            <li> I have a medium/dark complexion, and this applies very light.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very good and affordable primer, not oily, and leaves your  skin very natural and silky!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Goes on very smooth.</li>
            <li> I bought this, at the recommendation of my stylist friend, to fill in my fine lines and it works amazing.</li>
            <li> and I have to make sure I am using my magnification mirror  to make sure this isn&#x27;t happening.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Im in love with tthis product.  </li>
            <li> It does what it claims and more.</li>
            <li> After a  16hr day im oil free!</li>
            <li> The filler from Sephora The POREfessional is so much better. .</li>
            <li> the product is ok but for this price there is barley something in that tube.</li>
            <li> It was a good price, it does the trick I guess, but just not crazy about it.  </li>
            <li> This primer is ok.</li>
            <li> Works better and is a lot cheaper than the stuff I was buying from Clinique.</li>
            <li> Plus, they are cruelty free, which is non-negotiable to me!</li>
            <li> and I love this filler.</li>
            <li> and I will be buying more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure but don&#x27;t expect this to be a miracle cream like Miracle Blur.</li>
            <li> It gives me a nice smooth finish</li>
            <li> Love NYX products.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love most NYX products, and this one works well.  </li>
            <li> theres sumthing better  </li>
            <li> im sure</li>
            <li> and they look so much better and even when I use it as a primer before my foundation</li>
            <li> but I love it.</li>
            <li> I recommend spending more and going with Pores</li>
            <li> My pores are not horrible, and are most noticeable on the cheeks closest to my nose, and my nose.</li>
            <li> it helps your decision, my skin is fair/light, and gets the most oils around my nose during the summer months (no surprise there).</li>
            <li> It also didn&#x27;t fill in wrinkles, just sat on top of them</li>
            <li> I love the texture and silky feel of this product.</li>
            <li> I have big pores and this works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> I love NYX products.</li>
            <li> Face feels nice and smooth after application.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s ok ..</li>
            <li> I used to use Benefit - POREfessional, but when I needed to budget myself better I started using NYX and e.l.f. products.</li>
            <li> No, it won&#x27;t actually fill in every pore flawlessly, but what it does  is&lt;br /</li>
            <li> and I have to say I love it.  </li>
            <li> Love luv it.</li>
            <li> I really love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Might as well invest in something better.</li>
            <li> I love the way it goes on, I love how it feels and looks.</li>
            <li> I purchased this on a whim, and I&#x27;m really glad I did.</li>
            <li> This product is okay.</li>
            <li> Love love love love!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Wish</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> and I can see myself having to buy it more often.</li>
            <li> but once it&#x27;s distributed it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li> NYX&#x27;s Pore Filler does a pretty good job of filling pores and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin like Maybelline&#x27;s Baby Skin.  </li>
            <li> I am satisfied and overly excited regarding many products for this line.  </li>
            <li> The instant pore coverage is very good.</li>
            <li> On a whim, I tried this product because so many wrote it made a huge difference.</li>
            <li> got here early and it worked great.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast so that&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> Although it spreads easily, squeezing it out of the tube it sort of shoots out, like</li>
            <li> You can easily put makeup under or over it.</li>
            <li> would think my pores are fine ..</li>
            <li> but this worked great and does not dry out your skin.</li>
            <li> Seems to do just fine.</li>
            <li> fantastic will be reordering soon.</li>
            <li> SMOOTH EVEN SKIN.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> happy it the same day.  </li>
            <li> My foundation goes on really smooth and spreads like butter.  </li>
            <li> Once applied on my skin the texture is smooth, with a powdery/matte finish.</li>
            <li> This product makes my skin UNBELIEVABLY smooth- like powdered silk.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and is invisible whether you use it alone or under foundation.</li>
            <li> This product glides over your skin, filling in the pores and allows foundation to go on as though you had smooth skin.  </li>
            <li> It make my skin look smooth.</li>
            <li> I then apply this and it makes my face smooth and minimizes pores.</li>
            <li> It has a silky smooth texture.</li>
            <li> It also seems to show a film when dusted lightly with powder.</li>
            <li> well this did the trick, who would have known something so cheap</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great if you were to use this on its own but doesn&#x27;t do much when you put makeup over it, even after letting it dry.</li>
            <li> it is quick and easy.</li>
            <li> I usually just use it on my cheeks and nose under my foundation or BB cream, and it blends so well with my makeup and makes my skin look flawless.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not magic, but it&#x27;s impressive.  </li>
            <li> (large pores mostly)</li>
            <li> The pore filler arrived quickly and I was excited.  </li>
            <li> Good for oily areas such as t-zone.  </li>
            <li> i love this stuff so much</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do that good of a job at filling my pores as it wasn&#x27;t opaque enough...</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this one.</li>
            <li> Obviously my face isn&#x27;t startlett flawless but its close enough</li>
            <li> OK, when I look in the mirror in NATURAL light, I see everything.</li>
            <li> okay enough but not her favorite product.</li>
            <li> But if you&#x27;re looking for something that won&#x27;t irritate more sensitive skin and that is a long the vein of Porefessional, this is probably a good fit.</li>
            <li> &gt; pretty much instantly smooth out your face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not the magic pill, but I can&#x27;t live without it as a part of my makeup artillery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a very soft velvety feel but it did not help my pores look any better.</li>
            <li> This product really works wonders!!</li>
            <li> Works good on my facediesnt cover everything but makes pore look less noticeable so that works good enough for me</li>
            <li> Use this smooth cream filler to &amp;#34;fill&amp;#34; in large pores, pitted scars, and watch your skin even out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a smooth silky feel, and hides large pore immediately.</li>
            <li> This is  a very light-weight product, it does fill in pores and leaves face matted so that makeup goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> This pore filler is amazing, very silky, makes my face soft, and, does the job of filling my pores.</li>
            <li> Well worth the investment</li>
            <li> My make-up stays fresh looking through out the day.</li>
            <li> It provides beautiful, long lasting pore coverage, couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with the results, especially for the price!</li>
            <li> I have large pores and am always looking for the right product, so I really wanted to love this, but for the price I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> , however I do notice a caking up if  my application isn&#x27;t just right.</li>
            <li> But seems to work all right once it&#x27;s on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it on the backs of my hands on special occasions to make my hands look so much younger&lt;</li>
            <li> I have very large pores and have not run across any &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; product to date.</li>
            <li> I had some issues with the first bottle that I received but this seller replaced it right away</li>
            <li> it just kind of dried my skin and made it look like I had put on cheap cakey makeup.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of primers and this is just as great as primers more expensive</li>
            <li> I used this for the first time to compare it to POREfessional by Benefit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to find anything else that actually fills in pores like it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> Being a first time user of this product I based my purchase on reading the reviews and being a lover of NYX products.</li>
            <li> As a avid makeup buyer/lover.</li>
            <li> First of all, I was diagnosed with cystic acne at age 35.</li>
            <li> just bought another even though I&#x27;m still not done with my first buy.</li>
            <li> This product won&#x27;t diminish the appearance of pores entirely, but it will cause your skin to look more</li>
            <li> The actual product was okay.</li>
            <li> This received a stellar review from beautypedia</li>
            <li> Feels light and soft on your face.  </li>
            <li> This is a very concentrated and effective base to wear under your foundation, and the results are wonderful, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Love this product, will definitely be a continued purchase on my list.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice that it makes my skin look super smooth or makes my makeup last too much longer.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried much more expensive products that have not given me as good a result as this.</li>
            <li> Not super amazing.</li>
            <li> so when I use it my face is super soft.  </li>
            <li> By the way I do not have large pores.</li>
            <li> Blend it in well, and it does just what it is designed to do; fill large pores.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think my pores are that large, but this still didn&#x27;t seem to make any difference.  </li>
            <li> My pores are large all over my face.</li>
            <li> It goes on matte and helps fill my large pores.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and large pores in the T Zone area.  </li>
            <li> I have large pores on my checks and quite a bit of redness.</li>
            <li> So if you have semi large pores it will definetly help.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 48 with large pores , oily skin, and sun</li>
            <li> My pores are rather large, this worked well on some areas of my face.</li>
            <li> I tried to take in consideration that I have large pores.</li>
            <li> I have large pores and some acne scarring.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It did not reduce my fairly LARGE pores.</li>
            <li> Sadly I have HUGE pores, so this doesn&#x27;t do the trick on the large ones but it covers up the smalls ones pretty good</li>
            <li> It still does not completely make my face look smooth, especially under makeup, but it is better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I would certainly say it reduced my pore size but not as much as as Z Pore, that I&#x27;ve  been using.</li>
            <li> Now, my makeup looks HD ready, and those large pores on my nose are gone.  </li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t really help minimize the large pores.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have huge pores but this product definitely did not fill whatever pores I do have.</li>
            <li> thanks 👌</li>
            <li> I am very oily...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shipping was really fast</li>
            <li> highly recommend this and the seller!</li>
            <li> Thought I&#x27;d give this a try since I seem to really like this brand.</li>
            <li> , I feel this really helps in hiding the pore size.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> If you apply too much, you may have this problem.  </li>
            <li> Thanks, Amazon</li>
            <li> Shipped fast.</li>
            <li> I expected more from a RuPaul-endorsed product.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t really expect much</li>
            <li> but this worked really well.</li>
            <li> You have to be careful sometimes when you sqeeze this tube more comes out though.</li>
            <li> I expected that it would be creamy, more like a primer or even a foundation-type consistency.  </li>
            <li> Really doesnt cover much at all.</li>
            <li> so I could really judge the difference.</li>
            <li> but it drys really fast</li>
            <li> I got a sample of Hourglass Makeup Primer that I really like</li>
            <li> Fills pours very well.</li>
            <li> duh it dosnt claim to me but for the time it is on its a god send it looks and feels so good.</li>
            <li> WOW!!!</li>
            <li> and I live in florida and have very oily skin in the t-zone area!</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t make all your pores disappear, particularly if you have some large ones as I do.</li>
            <li> Yes, the bottle is small, but you need just a little amount to get the job done and it works perfectly.  </li>
            <li> I probably have about 12 significant deep crater scars.</li>
            <li> Fills in pores for the most part, sometimes I feel like it doesn&#x27;t work as well as it does other times.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really thick but not thin like using Monistat Soothing Care</li>
            <li> I have pretty sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It dried out very quick on my nose as well!  </li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical when I first ordered this, but it is amazing!</li>
            <li> I do have older skin ( 58yrs )</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it didn&#x27;t particularly work for me.</li>
            <li> Really don&#x27;t plan to spend money on expensive sephora brands when NYX is so great.</li>
            <li> i highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews on this item before I purchased it and had high hopes.</li>
            <li> But overall I think it&#x27;s worth buying and using as a cheaper pore filler.  </li>
            <li> I feel that only minimal touch ups are required later in the day and that for me makes this product a good one.</li>
            <li> Makes large pores less noticeable as well as some acne scars and light wrinkles.</li>
            <li> and I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> /&gt; Very soft silky feel on skin, not greasy.  </li>
            <li> The first time I tried it left build up on my nose.</li>
            <li> Yes, it is a small tube, but certainly a much better deal at&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have pretty big visible pores</li>
            <li> Maybe it will work better for a person with small pores.</li>
            <li> As many reviewers have pointed out, this is not a magic filler.</li>
            <li> Magic in a small tube.</li>
            <li> Great - not greasy or thick, really smooths my face without feeling heavy.</li>
            <li> i used the more expensive benefit counter pore minimizer, which i loved, but this one works just as well and is under half the price !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Asian, olive toned with large pores on my T-zone area.</li>
            <li> I have large pores on my nose and this product when applied in just a tiny amount made them invisible.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend if your pores are that large and definitely if you have redness.</li>
            <li> If you have large pores this product is nothing short of a miracle worker.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot of wrinkles, just a few fine lines and this product completely covers them up.</li>
            <li> If I need to suggest I would say this one was a old one</li>
            <li> I used to be an Urban Decay girl, but this is all so much easier on the wallet.</li>
            <li> NYC rocks as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
            <li> This is really just a simple silicone-y pate.</li>
            <li> So far this is the 1st pore filler I have tried.</li>
            <li> I am 34 years old</li>
            <li> maybe it&#x27;s old and separating?</li>
            <li> As far as a &#x27;pore&#x27; filler goes - yes noticeably fills small-med pores.</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s just ok, no different than any other primer I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li> I was looking for a new primer after I used up all of my bare minerals primer.  </li>
            <li> I have to wait a few minutes for this to dry before I can apply my makeup, but it does help my makeup not sink into my pores and look much more natural.</li>
            <li> I had read the reviews and already understood that this was a small amount of product, so I apply this only on areas that my pores are more noticeable.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;m older, I only rinse my face with water in the morning.</li>
            <li> but I had no previous acne problems before this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a bit pricey for a small package, but the trick is to only layer it where you need it most.</li>
            <li> No More, unless you just want something cheap for shine control.</li>
            <li> ( I wear my makeup for long periods of time too, like a whole day) and it wasn&#x27;t a problem</li>
            <li> Very silky and doesn&#x27;t pill-up with 2nd application or if using over foundation which was applied earlier in day.  </li>
            <li> I use this everyday to help moisturizer and foundation quickly absorb and set.</li>
            <li> Overall it is a good, not perfect product.</li>
            <li> Only 4 stars because it does not go very far</li>
            <li> However, I am not sure if it makes a significant difference to my appearance.</li>
            <li> The price is great and works just as wekk as smashbox and other expensive pore primers.</li>
            <li> I have large pores, and this didn&#x27;t seem to do what expected...</li>
            <li> Helps with damaged skin large or open pores it helps give ur face a great base for ur makeup</li>
            <li> I could get it in a bigger size, makes my face so soft.</li>
            <li> not sure if this was the true cause,</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use on drier or normal areas or it will feel too dry.  </li>
            <li> Leaves face smooth and a good base for makeup!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not yet completely convinced if I&#x27;ll repurchase, I have a lot of product left, but I&#x27;d definitely consider it!</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t completely camouflage your pores, especially the larger ones, but it does reduce appearance.  </li>
            <li> but it costs $30 for half as much.</li>
            <li> I found that this product was not as good as Clinique&#x27;s instant perfector in the color &amp;#34;light,&amp;#34; and Clinique was less expensive.</li>
            <li> /&gt;NYX will help make small wrinkles, laugh lines, pores, any minor imperfections  </li>
            <li> easily apply some before I run out on errands to look less tired than my old face shows LOL!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> its not half empty its moussed so its air fluffed</li>
            <li> Only con about this product is that I feel that there is not enough product to last very long.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is apparent to me,  due to the small amount and  tendency to cake up  when applied over or under makeup,  that it is meant to only use sparingly and only on the areas of large pores.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You get a younger fresher appearance,  smoother skin ,  helps foundation go on evenly, lasts a long time</li>
            <li> Deceptively smaller, lighter, not much in the tiny container.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely light-weight and non-comedogenic, and only a tiny amount is required.</li>
            <li> After a few months of ignoring this product thinking it did nothing, I tried it again and was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a strange odor</li>
            <li> covers well, but doesn&#x27;t stay on long.</li>
            <li> It holds up just as well if not better than the bare minerals primer that is much more expensive.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Dimethicone / Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Cyclopentasiloxane, Silica, Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben, Ethylparaben, Butylparaben, Propylparaben, Isobutylparaben, Tocopheryl Acetate, Titanium Dioxide ( CI 77891 ), Iron Oxide Yellow ( CI 77492 ), Iron Oxide Red ( CI 77491 ), Iron Oxide Black ( CI 77499 ).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Addendum:  </li>
            <li> I wanted this for a very long time</li>
            <li> Rest of the year skin is not oily or dry.</li>
            <li> Also, the tube seems like it was already half empty when I first tried it out, Small tube too.</li>
            <li> It wear off after a few hours, but a tiny drop smoothed over makeup mid day fixes you all over again.  </li>
            <li> I guess I expected a miracle &amp;#34;filler&amp;#34;, but NYX Pore Filler is a good base for my powder foundation and seems to help with oil control.  </li>
            <li> but it barely blurs anything, and there is so little in the tube</li>
            <li> However, it was only average.</li>
            <li> If you have larger pores this will tone it down</li>
            <li> If you have clear skin with very few pore issues, this will work for you.  </li>
            <li> It seemed like it was super old and smelled bad</li>
            <li> Only thing is that it has so little product</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and would definitely recommend it if your pores are a problem for you.</li>
            <li> it came as expected.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t last through the day and is not easy to reapply.</li>
            <li> This stuff rivals the Clinique brand pore minimizer and is less than half the price and double the size!!  </li>
            <li> The texture is odd - feels almost dry coming out of the tube.</li>
            <li> It goes on very smoothly, a little goes a long way and it stays put all day.</li>
            <li> Not sure yet, if I&#x27;m going to keep it or go back to using Z pore by Goodskin at Kohl&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> It helped a bit but nothing extremely noticeable.</li>
            <li> Feels and looks greasy to me and doesn&#x27;t seem to hold in place for small facial scars.</li>
            <li> Because the tube is small, it probably wouldn&#x27;t last a month if I used it on all work</li>
            <li> Not worth the money .</li>
            <li> and I typically don&#x27;t need anything but a bit of under-eye concealer when I do my makeup.</li>
            <li> /&gt; less noticeable.</li>
            <li> (may vary&lt;br /&gt;more or less depending on what you do during the day).</li>
            <li> and I had less oil.  </li>
            <li> Helped my pores look less noticeable, and gave makeup a silkier texture.  </li>
            <li> I do see a small difference in my pores when I use it but not much.  </li>
            <li> This is not to be used to cover dark spots or uneven tones because it&#x27;s not made for that.</li>
            <li> The texture out of the packaging is a little odd and took me some getting used to but doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
            <li> It works a little on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s tinted, and a little goes</li>
            <li> Just a little bit</li>
            <li> I never knew what I was missing until I tried this. .one</li>
            <li> I use this everyday</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this product as it was heavy on my skin</li>
            <li> A waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> Did not know I needed one, but using this everyday under my foundation and over my moisturizer has convinced me that my face needed it.</li>
            <li> I uses this everyday.</li>
            <li> Also, noticed that after a few days of using it, I started to breakout around my chin and nose area (the areas I was attempting to shrink pore size)...</li>
            <li> My only complaint, very small tube.</li>
            <li> Other reviewers complained about the whitish color.  </li>
            <li> My pores are small to begin with.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a pore refiner from Kohl&#x27;s for the past 5 years.</li>
            <li> so I usually apply this and then do my eyebrows and then put on foundation</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> It works well in humid weather to absorb oil, so I&#x27;m not sure how it will work in the winter.</li>
            <li> I always shake mine before I apply, you can either apply with a small brush or your hands.</li>
            <li> Not sure why some report it hard to apply because dimethicone is a silcone oil that goes on easily.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it is hardly noticeable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve waited to use this product for at least a month before I review it</li>
            <li> Seriously....</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t express enough how badly the pores are on my nose</li>
            <li> Not sure how to describe it sorry.  </li>
            <li> and they looked worse.</li>
            <li> I hate to be that person who gives a low review on a product that seemingly works well for others..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why there are any bad reviews of this product.  </li>
            <li> I only face it one star very disappointed!</li>
            <li> It is very silly</li>
            <li> This product comes out of the tube very weird.</li>
            <li> I dont know if I bought a bad bottle</li>
            <li> I have never had bad skin</li>
            <li> I am telling you, for the price you will not be disappointed to try this.</li>
            <li> but i bought this for a base...</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is an excellent product.  It makes your foundation glide on and none of my pores show!</li>
            <li> Gives your skin a velvety finish.</li>
            <li> makes your face feel amazing</li>
            <li> I never knew what I was missing until I tried this. .one would think my pores are fine ..This eliminates all the imperfections</li>
            <li> NYX Cosmetics Pore Filler has been a staple of my makeup routine for several years.  I have visible pores on my nose and an orange-peel texture on either side of my nose, which this pore filler essentially eliminates.  It&#x27;s nice to blend it in and watch it all disappear.  I find it stays put despite my oily/combination skin and it doesn&#x27;t worsen acne.  Big fan!</li>
            <li> I used this for the first time to compare it to POREfessional by Benefit. I can say it works just as well.  I think i will continue using NYX instead of Benefit. It is inexpensive compared to $31.00 for 0.75FL OZl of POREfessional. NYX 0.65 FL OZ for$14.99  I think this product gives Benefit a run for their money$. It minimizes the appearance of pores and makes them invisible. My pores are small to begin with. I found my replacement.  Thanx NYX</li>
            <li> fantastic will be reordering soon.</li>
            <li> Everythin is good and the shipment in it best condition, thanks 👌</li>
            <li> I had read the reviews and already understood that this was a small amount of product, so I apply this only on areas that my pores are more noticeable. I like the way it feels and can notice a difference with the appearance of pores, the color does blend well with my foundation, however I do notice a caking up if  my application isn&#x27;t just right. I use a moisturizer, foundation and then this and I have to make sure I am using my magnification mirror  to make sure this isn&#x27;t happening.&lt;br /&gt;It is apparent to me,  due to the small amount and  tendency to cake up  when applied over or under makeup,  that it is meant to only use sparingly and only on the areas of large pores. I do have older skin ( 58yrs ) so that might be a contributing factor in my experience with this product. I would recommend it to others but would also explain about my issues with how I use it,</li>
            <li> This pore filler is amazing, very silky, makes my face soft, and, does the job of filling my pores. It helps make my foundation look flawless. Would buy this again.</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff! And amazing price!</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t last through the day and is not easy to reapply. I have a medium/dark complexion, and this applies very light. I won&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I am very oily... but i bought this for a base... im 39 and needing more lol.  Im in love with tthis product.  It does what it claims and more. After a  16hr day im oil free! And my makeup looked great!</li>
            <li> Great product but overpriced for size</li>
            <li> This product is magic! I absolutely love it and recommend it to everyone! I use it to fill my pores and then use a foundation primer over top and it gives you the most flawless face ever!! It&#x27;s for sure a must buy!</li>
            <li> This product is ok to me, not bad but not the best.  I do see a small difference in my pores when I use it but not much.  It is very silly so when I use it my face is super soft.  I won&#x27;t purchase this again.</li>
            <li> Great &amp; Quick shipping!</li>
            <li> Not worth the money . The filler from Sephora The POREfessional is so much better. .</li>
            <li> It did not cover my pores.</li>
            <li> the product is ok but for this price there is barley something in that tube. If I need to suggest I would say this one was a old one</li>
            <li> This stuff is great and a screaming deal for the money. You will be happy with the results. Awesome and it works!!</li>
            <li> It was a good price, it does the trick I guess, but just not crazy about it.  If you have clear skin with very few pore issues, this will work for you.  Otherwise, it didn&#x27;t particularly work for me.</li>
            <li> I guess I expected a miracle &amp;#34;filler&amp;#34;, but NYX Pore Filler is a good base for my powder foundation and seems to help with oil control.  I use it with a setting spray.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great for anyone with prominent pores.  It&#x27;s extremely light-weight and non-comedogenic, and only a tiny amount is required. Makes visible pores simply vanish, and is long-lasting.  I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li> This primer is ok. It&#x27;s only $10 but it gets the job done. I dont know if I bought a bad bottle but the product came out lumpy, like there&#x27;s air in the bottle and when I squeeze it, it&#x27;s like it&#x27;s passing gas. The product is good but doesn&#x27;t easily spread so you may be using more than is needed, I feel it should be more saturated. It does minimize my pores.</li>
            <li> It has a very soft velvety feel but it did not help my pores look any better. There was no difference on my face. By the way I do not have large pores.</li>
            <li> Bought two tubes and will buy again.</li>
            <li> I wanted this for a very long time and I&#x27;m really satisfied with it! It&#x27;s a very good and affordable primer, not oily, and leaves your  skin very natural and silky!&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was really fast and it came covered in bubble wrap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this and the seller!</li>
            <li> Works better and is a lot cheaper than the stuff I was buying from Clinique.</li>
            <li> Works good on my facediesnt cover everything but makes pore look less noticeable so that works good enough for me</li>
            <li> Great product, does make skin appear smoother. My only complaint, very small tube.</li>
            <li> Not super amazing. I have combination oily skin and only noticed that it helped a TINY bit once or twice.  EDIT: After a few months of ignoring this product thinking it did nothing, I tried it again and was pleasantly surprised. It actually helped to keep my foundation (Estee Lauder Double Wear) in place as a primer and keep it from breaking up around my nose. It smooths skin and does help to minimize pours and helps with priming face. I&#x27;m not yet completely convinced if I&#x27;ll repurchase, I have a lot of product left, but I&#x27;d definitely consider it! Be sure you are applying correctly though, it&#x27;s very easy to displace primers and pore fillers if you are buffing foundation into your face.</li>
            <li> Does the job! Really don&#x27;t plan to spend money on expensive sephora brands when NYX is so great. Plus, they are cruelty free, which is non-negotiable to me! I used to be an Urban Decay girl, but this is all so much easier on the wallet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a pore refiner from Kohl&#x27;s for the past 5 years. Thought I&#x27;d give this a try since I seem to really like this brand. I think that they offer good products for a good price. I like that this is tinted, I feel this really helps in hiding the pore size. It&#x27;s not really thick but not thin like using Monistat Soothing Care Chafing Relief Powder Gel on your face. It&#x27;s still silky feeling putting it on. I&#x27;m Asian, olive toned with large pores on my T-zone area. I suffered with oily skin and now have a dryer skin with age but this worked great and does not dry out your skin. I would certainly say it reduced my pore size but not as much as as Z Pore, that I&#x27;ve  been using. Not sure yet, if I&#x27;m going to keep it or go back to using Z pore by Goodskin at Kohl&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I have pores on my nose and cheek area so I usually apply this and then do my eyebrows and then put on foundation and I love this filler. Obviously my face isn&#x27;t startlett flawless but its close enough and I will be buying more. If you have larger pores this will tone it down I&#x27;m sure but don&#x27;t expect this to be a miracle cream like Miracle Blur.</li>
            <li> My favorite go-to product! It gives me a nice smooth finish and I typically don&#x27;t need anything but a bit of under-eye concealer when I do my makeup. It also helps with my oily skin. The texture out of the packaging is a little odd and took me some getting used to but doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Good for oily areas such as t-zone.  Don&#x27;t use on drier or normal areas or it will feel too dry.  I have combo/oily skin and this works great on forehead, nose, and chin.  Great price too.  Love NYX products.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical when I first ordered this, but it is amazing! It literally instantly makes my pores disappear. I usually just use it on my cheeks and nose under my foundation or BB cream, and it blends so well with my makeup and makes my skin look flawless. I haven&#x27;t been able to find anything else that actually fills in pores like it&#x27;s supposed to. I use it everyday and would definitely recommend it if your pores are a problem for you. Great product!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why there are any bad reviews of this product.  Yes, the bottle is small, but you need just a little amount to get the job done and it works perfectly.  I have large pores on my nose and this product when applied in just a tiny amount made them invisible.  I have tried much more expensive pore fillers (clinique, Dr. Brandt, Perricone, including almost every one carried by Sephora) and none have worked as well as this one.  NYC rocks as far as I&#x27;m concerned. Their prices are great and products deliver.</li>
            <li> Being a first time user of this product I based my purchase on reading the reviews and being a lover of NYX products. Someone having a pore problem the product did what it was intended to do. Only con about this product is that I feel that there is not enough product to last very long.</li>
            <li> Seems to do just fine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great if you were to use this on its own but doesn&#x27;t do much when you put makeup over it, even after letting it dry.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff. As a avid makeup buyer/lover. This is just as good as any pore filler I have bought at Sephora. It makes my skin look flawless. Every lady needs this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d never even heard of a &amp;#34;pore filler&amp;#34; before I ordered it.  It&#x27;s not magic, but it&#x27;s impressive.  I only use it on the bridge and sides of my nose, but it definitely makes a difference.</li>
            <li> I found that this product was not as good as Clinique&#x27;s instant perfector in the color &amp;#34;light,&amp;#34; and Clinique was less expensive.</li>
            <li> Never used a pore filler before, and I think I chose wisely.  I love most NYX products, and this one works well.  Other reviewers complained about the whitish color.  It doesn&#x27;t seem white at all after applying.  If you apply too much, you may have this problem.  Blend it in well, and it does just what it is designed to do; fill large pores.  Now, my makeup looks HD ready, and those large pores on my nose are gone.  Well worth the investment</li>
            <li> It works a little on my cheeks. I just wish it was cheaper. Also, the tube seems like it was already half empty when I first tried it out, Small tube too.</li>
            <li> I have tried a ton of different pore minimizers. This is the only one I continue to use. It still does not completely make my face look smooth, especially under makeup, but it is better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I thought it&#x27;d be a cheaper alternative to Benefit&#x27;s POREfessional.  This did NOT work for me.  I don&#x27;t think my pores are that large, but this still didn&#x27;t seem to make any difference.  I think I&#x27;ll stick to Benefit.</li>
            <li> cant com[plain but wont be buying it again. theres sumthing better  im sure</li>
            <li> I bought this, at the recommendation of my stylist friend, to fill in my fine lines and it works amazing. I don&#x27;t have a lot of wrinkles, just a few fine lines and this product completely covers them up. I often work 16 hr days and have a physically demanding job, this product last all day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve waited to use this product for at least a month before I review it so I can give my honest opinion...the package got to my house perfect and after I used the product on my gave daily with and withouth foundation I can defenetely day that it did made my pores smaller and they look so much better and even when I use it as a primer before my foundation it&#x27;s just perfect</li>
            <li> Goes on very smooth. However, I am not sure if it makes a significant difference to my appearance.</li>
            <li> WOW!!! I am taking the time to review this product because I buy everything  according to reviews. First of all, I was diagnosed with cystic acne at age 35. The acne is gone, but the pitted scars are deep! On a whim, I tried this product because so many wrote it made a huge difference. OK, when I look in the mirror in NATURAL light, I see everything. My pores are large all over my face. I probably have about 12 significant deep crater scars. This product is from heaven. It&#x27;s tinted, and a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, moisturize your face with a non oil based product. I have oily skin, but it doesn&#x27;t matter. It helps. Use this smooth cream filler to &amp;#34;fill&amp;#34; in large pores, pitted scars, and watch your skin even out. Miracle. Absolutely amazing. Afterwards, just apply your foundation. See if you missed any spots, then dab into the holes or apply to the pores you missed. Then powder with a mineral based powder, and VOILA! SMOOTH EVEN SKIN.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just bought another even though I&#x27;m still not done with my first buy. I hope they never stop selling this!</li>
            <li> I have never had bad skin but I&#x27;m 50 now and was worried it might not wk for me but I love it.My make-up stays fresh looking through out the day.Thanks, Amazon</li>
            <li> This pore filler is absolutely the best on the market in my opinion.  I&#x27;ve purchased this product in stores, but Amazon offers the best price.  I plan to stock up!</li>
            <li> no its not a perminent fix duh it dosnt claim to me but for the time it is on its a god send it looks and feels so good. its not half empty its moussed so its air fluffed theres a difference. i love this stuff so much i have it saved for future purchase.</li>
            <li> i used the more expensive benefit counter pore minimizer, which i loved, but this one works just as well and is under half the price ! i highly recommend. i use it with the shine killer. it makes me skin look flawless!!!</li>
            <li> got here early and it worked great. very happy with the result. I used. happy it the same day.  GREAT</li>
            <li> Make up goes on easier and stays on longer.  Actually does fill in pores.  Works great!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I can say enough about this primer.  I use this everyday and I have very sensitive skin and I didn&#x27;t break out from this at all. My foundation goes on really smooth and spreads like butter.  I will purchase this again love it!</li>
            <li> Fills in pores for the most part, sometimes I feel like it doesn&#x27;t work as well as it does other times. It has a strange odor but it is hardly noticeable.</li>
            <li> Deceptively smaller, lighter, not much in the tiny container. Shipped fast.</li>
            <li> The first time I tried it left build up on my nose. It dried out very quick on my nose as well!  I only face it one star very disappointed!</li>
            <li> I expected more from a RuPaul-endorsed product. This is really just a simple silicone-y pate. Its a translucent greyish tan--nothing like the product spread out in the picture. It didn&#x27;t do that good of a job at filling my pores as it wasn&#x27;t opaque enough... it just kind of dried my skin and made it look like I had put on cheap cakey makeup. I recommend spending more and going with Pores No More, unless you just want something cheap for shine control.</li>
            <li> I had some issues with the first bottle that I received but this seller replaced it right away and I love this pore filler!  I use it occasionally when I know that I&#x27;ll be taking photos because it makes a difference.  It won&#x27;t completely camouflage your pores, especially the larger ones, but it does reduce appearance.  It is a great product for the price and I will be purchasing it again in the future.</li>
            <li> Once applied on my skin the texture is smooth, with a powdery/matte finish. My pores are not horrible, and are most noticeable on the cheeks closest to my nose, and my nose. This product won&#x27;t diminish the appearance of pores entirely, but it will cause your skin to look more consistent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it helps your decision, my skin is fair/light, and gets the most oils around my nose during the summer months (no surprise there). Rest of the year skin is not oily or dry.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this product as it was heavy on my skin and it clogged my pores.  It also didn&#x27;t fill in wrinkles, just sat on top of them and they looked worse.</li>
            <li> So far this is the 1st pore filler I have tried. It goes on matte and helps fill my large pores. I feel it doesn&#x27;t spread so great but again I have nothing to compare it to.</li>
            <li> This was a stocking stuffer for our daughter for Christmas, and she likes it okay enough but not her favorite product.</li>
            <li> This product makes my skin UNBELIEVABLY smooth- like powdered silk.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. The instant pore coverage is very good. It&#x27;s a smooth silky feel, and hides large pore immediately. I will be buying this again.</li>
            <li> I like this stuff a lot. Goes on smooth and is invisible whether you use it alone or under foundation.</li>
            <li> I love the texture and silky feel of this product. I think it works well with filling in the pores. This is not to be used to cover dark spots or uneven tones because it&#x27;s not made for that.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and large pores in the T Zone area.  I have tried every primer under the sun.... Seriously.... At ALL price points.  This product glides over your skin, filling in the pores and allows foundation to go on as though you had smooth skin.  I have this stock piled.  It wear off after a few hours, but a tiny drop smoothed over makeup mid day fixes you all over again.  Plus... Doesn&#x27;t break you out!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have huge pores but this product definitely did not fill whatever pores I do have.</li>
            <li> I have big pores and this works wonderfully. It makes my face look flawless and almost china doll like. Yeah...that good.</li>
            <li> Did not do what was promised.  A waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> It seemed like it was super old and smelled bad</li>
            <li> This is  a very light-weight product, it does fill in pores and leaves face matted so that makeup goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> Love this. Been using it for several years.</li>
            <li> The texture is odd - feels almost dry coming out of the tube. But seems to work all right once it&#x27;s on.</li>
            <li> covers well, but doesn&#x27;t stay on long. also is a pain to blend bc it pills up and i feel like i&#x27;m wiping all of it off trying to get rid of the pills. :/ but once it&#x27;s distributed it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast so that&#x27;s good. The actual product was okay. I have large pores on my checks and quite a bit of redness. Although it did help cover up the redness and it stayed away for majority of the time ( I wear my makeup for long periods of time too, like a whole day) and it wasn&#x27;t a problem it didn&#x27;t really help minimize the large pores. It helped a bit but nothing extremely noticeable. So if you have semi large pores it will definetly help. It also didn&#x27;t cause my face to get oily either which is a plus with this type of primer. I would recommend if your pores are that large and definitely if you have redness.</li>
            <li> Great - not greasy or thick, really smooths my face without feeling heavy. SO GOOD!</li>
            <li> I love NYX products. I use this under my foundation.  It make my skin look smooth.</li>
            <li> Face feels nice and smooth after application. Looks great!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a new primer after I used up all of my bare minerals primer.  This received a stellar review from beautypedia so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  It holds up just as well if not better than the bare minerals primer that is much more expensive.</li>
            <li> NYX&#x27;s Pore Filler does a pretty good job of filling pores and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin like Maybelline&#x27;s Baby Skin.  Similar to Benefit&#x27;s Porefessional, it is a tan colored creamy product.  I would not consider this product a dupe for Porefessional, however.  The texture is slightly different and doesn&#x27;t melt into the skin the may the Benefit product does.  But overall I think it&#x27;s worth buying and using as a cheaper pore filler.  I don&#x27;t know how well this works as primer.  I don&#x27;t notice that it makes my skin look super smooth or makes my makeup last too much longer.  But if you&#x27;re looking for something that won&#x27;t irritate more sensitive skin and that is a long the vein of Porefessional, this is probably a good fit.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! I have an oily T-zone and when I apply NYX pore filler to my T-zone looks flawless!! (I totally recommended this product for oily skin as well as a pore filler.)</li>
            <li> Only thing is that it has so little product but it&#x27;s ok ..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a pore filler before. Did not know I needed one, but using this everyday under my foundation and over my moisturizer has convinced me that my face needed it. It goes on very smoothly, a little goes a long way and it stays put all day. Wearing eye makeup and blush has become marginally easier but what is really different is the wear of my makeup throughout the day. I feel that only minimal touch ups are required later in the day and that for me makes this product a good one.</li>
            <li> Good pore filler for the price. I used to use Benefit - POREfessional, but when I needed to budget myself better I started using NYX and e.l.f. products. This is not as great as POREfessional, but it is still really pretty good.</li>
            <li> This product does its job. It is amazing! I just wish they made it in a larger tube!</li>
            <li> No, it won&#x27;t actually fill in every pore flawlessly, but what it does  is&lt;br /&gt; pretty much instantly smooth out your face.&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;m 48 with large pores , oily skin, and sun damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NYX will help make small wrinkles, laugh lines, pores, any minor imperfections  basically become&lt;br /&gt; less noticeable. Not the magic pill, but I can&#x27;t live without it as a part of my makeup artillery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I easily apply some before I run out on errands to look less tired than my old face shows LOL!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leaves  matte appearance. My best description is to say flaws retreat from the foreground  - to the background.&lt;br /&gt; Very soft silky feel on skin, not greasy.  No odor.&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;ve used it on the backs of my hands on special occasions to make my hands look so much younger&lt;br /&gt; and not so leathery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You get a younger fresher appearance,  smoother skin ,  helps foundation go on evenly, lasts a long time (may vary&lt;br /&gt;more or less depending on what you do during the day). Yes, it is a small tube, but certainly a much better deal at&lt;br /&gt; $14.00 than what  I paid  for my former pore filler at about $40 to $70 for the same size tube.</li>
            <li> I use this before I apply my makeup &amp; it goes on beautifully.</li>
            <li> Leaves face smooth and a good base for makeup!</li>
            <li> I have pretty big visible pores and I didn&#x27;t really expect much but this worked really well. Just a little bit and my cheeks look air brushed.</li>
            <li> I just started using this over the weekend and I have to say I love it.  It smoothes out my makeup and I had less oil.  I am satisfied and overly excited regarding many products for this line.  And it is inexpensive.  Love luv it.</li>
            <li> I thought this way going to be like the porefessional, it&#x27;s not. I really wanted to love this one.</li>
            <li> My pores are rather large, this worked well on some areas of my face.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday to help moisturizer and foundation quickly absorb and set.</li>
            <li> This stuff rivals the Clinique brand pore minimizer and is less than half the price and double the size!!  I really love this stuff.  Feels light and soft on your face.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This works great for your pores! I am 34 years old so I do have some pores. This makes my skin and makeup look flawless, Fills them right away and lasts all day. I uses this everyday. A great trick for this is when you are done putting on foundation put this on lightly over it on huge pore areas! Works perfect! You have to be careful sometimes when you sqeeze this tube more comes out though. The price is great and works just as wekk as smashbox and other expensive pore primers. Keep this in your stash for sure!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of primers and this is just as great as primers more expensive</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. Since I&#x27;m older, I only rinse my face with water in the morning. I then apply this and it makes my face smooth and minimizes pores. It seems to work to reduce pores, not just conceal them while I have this on. It works well in humid weather to absorb oil, so I&#x27;m not sure how it will work in the winter.</li>
            <li> Helped my pores look less noticeable, and gave makeup a silkier texture.  Price is good as well.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product! It provides beautiful, long lasting pore coverage, couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with the results, especially for the price!</li>
            <li> This product comes out of the tube very weird. I expected that it would be creamy, more like a primer or even a foundation-type consistency.  Although it spreads easily, squeezing it out of the tube it sort of shoots out, like maybe it&#x27;s old and separating? Not sure how to describe it sorry.  Overall I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s just ok, no different than any other primer I&#x27;ve tried and although it&#x27;s tinted it&#x27;s extremely sheer. I have large pores and am always looking for the right product, so I really wanted to love this, but for the price I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> This product really works wonders!! it came as expected. i think this is a great tool cover up your large pores!!</li>
            <li> Helps with damaged skin large or open pores it helps give ur face a great base for ur makeup so it lays evenly</li>
            <li> Sadly I have HUGE pores, so this doesn&#x27;t do the trick on the large ones but it covers up the smalls ones pretty good and it makes my face look semi-flawless.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! Makes large pores less noticeable as well as some acne scars and light wrinkles. It has a silky smooth texture. You can easily put makeup under or over it. I&#x27;ve been using it like a foundation, it doesn&#x27;t amplify your wrinkles like a lot of foundations do.</li>
            <li> Great pore filler compares well to benefit precessional but at a cheaper price</li>
            <li> Meh. Really doesnt cover much at all. I get that it&#x27;s supposed to be coverage in targeted areas (large pores mostly) but it barely blurs anything, and there is so little in the tube it feels like a rip off. Foundation will still get through it and into pores. Might as well invest in something better.</li>
            <li> Feels and looks greasy to me and doesn&#x27;t seem to hold in place for small facial scars. I also worry it make cause a break out on my oily skin. It also seems to show a film when dusted lightly with powder. I prefer Olay Regenerist Fill and Seal.</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading the reviews but my pores are not even that big and i still dont see any difference after applying this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried this before, but I&#x27;m loving it! I love the way it goes on, I love how it feels and looks. Will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews on this item before I purchased it and had high hopes. The pore filler arrived quickly and I was excited.  However, it was only average. I tried to take in consideration that I have large pores. Maybe it will work better for a person with small pores.</li>
            <li> I have large pores, and this didn&#x27;t seem to do what expected... they were still visible after application.  Also, noticed that after a few days of using it, I started to breakout around my chin and nose area (the areas I was attempting to shrink pore size)... not sure if this was the true cause, but I had no previous acne problems before this product.</li>
            <li> As many reviewers have pointed out, this is not a magic filler. It won&#x27;t make all your pores disappear, particularly if you have some large ones as I do. I have large pores and some acne scarring. For me, this hides a lot of my pores and makes the larger ones recede and not appear so noticeable. It helps with acne scarring as well, but again only to lessen the look of them. I have to wait a few minutes for this to dry before I can apply my makeup, but it does help my makeup not sink into my pores and look much more natural. I&#x27;ve tried much more expensive products that have not given me as good a result as this.</li>
            <li> I purchased this on a whim, and I&#x27;m really glad I did. This is a very concentrated and effective base to wear under your foundation, and the results are wonderful, in my opinion. After applying, I used one of my regular foundations so I could really judge the difference. I could immediately sense a wonderful smoothness as I applied it, and I felt that my skin looked much fresher. The best is that it lasted all day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a bit pricey for a small package, but the trick is to only layer it where you need it most. This is definitely a keeper -- I&#x27;ll buy it again before it runs out. Recommended!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t express enough how badly the pores are on my nose and I have tried everything well this did the trick, who would have known something so cheap would work especially after me spending hundreds of dollars looking for something that would work. You can even use this and not put any makeup on, you may want to dust some powder on but honestly you do not need it. It feels like silk going onto your face. You don&#x27;t need a lot. I always shake mine before I apply, you can either apply with a small brush or your hands. I use my hands b/c it is quick and easy. I am telling you, for the price you will not be disappointed to try this. I want to also add that throughout the day I notice my makeup stays set nicer and I do not get shine, even when I sweat and I live in florida and have very oily skin in the t-zone area! Love this product, will definitely be a continued purchase on my list.</li>
            <li> I think it works, but never tried others to compare it too so cant say its the best.</li>
            <li> This product is okay. It is not a total pore filler. I have very large pores and have not run across any &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; product to date. I do like that this does not have any fragrance as some so. It does leave my face matte for some time. Overall it is a good, not perfect product. I tried it based on Paula&#x27;s Choice recommendation.</li>
            <li> I would have given it 5 stars because it&#x27;s a good product but it drys really fast</li>
            <li> Magic in a small tube.</li>
            <li> The stuff feels like silk when you are applying it but I have to use about a dime size dollop to cover my entire face.  Because the tube is small, it probably wouldn&#x27;t last a month if I used it on all work days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After applying, my liquid foundation applies easier, smoother, and lighter.  Not sure why some report it hard to apply because dimethicone is a silcone oil that goes on easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;Dimethicone / Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Cyclopentasiloxane, Silica, Phenoxyethanol, Methylparaben, Ethylparaben, Butylparaben, Propylparaben, Isobutylparaben, Tocopheryl Acetate, Titanium Dioxide ( CI 77891 ), Iron Oxide Yellow ( CI 77492 ), Iron Oxide Red ( CI 77491 ), Iron Oxide Black ( CI 77499 ).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Addendum:  I changed my mind about this being costly.  I got a sample of Hourglass Makeup Primer that I really like and it works about the same but it costs $30 for half as much.</li>
            <li> Love love love love!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Wish I could get it in a bigger size, makes my face so soft. I love it. Also great because it hasn&#x27;t messed with my acne. I have pretty sensitive skin and it has been helping!</li>
            <li> Fills pours very well.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  Very silky and doesn&#x27;t pill-up with 2nd application or if using over foundation which was applied earlier in day.  Only 4 stars because it does not go very far and I can see myself having to buy it more often. As far as a &#x27;pore&#x27; filler goes - yes noticeably fills small-med pores.</li>
            <li> If you have large pores this product is nothing short of a miracle worker. It&#x27;s a life changer. You must try it!</li>
            <li> greay. best primer ever made</li>
            <li> I hate to be that person who gives a low review on a product that seemingly works well for others..&lt;br /&gt;However, I wasn&#x27;t too happy with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did not reduce my fairly LARGE pores. It was a crumbly pore filler that I had to work into my skin(but because it was so crumbly pieces of it would fall off my face when working it into my skin). I guess thats what I get for trying to go the cheaper route(I&#x27;m a POREfessional user)</li>
            <li> Not like the one I bought from the store.</li>
