            <li>Bonus: it is the most inexpensive lotion I have tried!</li>
            <li>Amazing.</li>
            <li>so the bronzing agent in here does not really affect me but the lotion itself is a great quality lotion...and best smelling lotion I&#x27;ve ever come across!!</li>
            <li>im a very easy tanner</li>
            <li>I get a nice bronze tan using Supre Berrylicious and it lives your skin soft and a nice pleasant scent</li>
            <li>Smells better than most indoor tanning lotions.</li>
            <li>Definitely my favorite tanning lotion and my husband loves the way it makes me smell</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many different indoor tanning products and this one has the greatest bang for your buck.</li>
            <li>great product, natural looking color.</li>
            <li>This is my absolute favorite tanning lotion and honestly I regret wanting to try anything else.</li>
            <li>The smell is fantastic</li>
            <li>We have tried more expensive lotions but this the best for us.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice smell for tanning at least - Im not sure that&#x27;s its the best lotion, but it was worth the money cuz it was cheap and its better than using no lotion.</li>
            <li>Would most definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li>and after just one use, I had VERY noticeable results!  </li>
            <li>Like it so much!</li>
            <li>so my skin ain&#x27;t easy to tan, but this is the only lotion I&#x27;ve found that makes me tan!</li>
            <li>The scent is great and it does give you that extra glow within the first few times of tanning with it.</li>
            <li>Gives nice dark color without turning orange!</li>
            <li>take the time to rub the product into your skin very well.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing, is streak-free, skin-firming, and you end with a dark, rich tan that looks like you spent the week in Cabo.</li>
            <li>This is a nice, thick, brozing lotion.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very natural looking and with</li>
            <li>The only downside is it runs out very fast.</li>
            <li>I bought this one on eBay for about the same price, but I like to know when I&#x27;m getting my stuff so for certain stuff</li>
            <li>If your knee&#x27;s or elbows are particularly wrinkly, cleanse those areas with the baby wipe as well, PRIOR to getting into the tanning bed.</li>
            <li>This product is not only affordable, but produces as close as I&#x27;ve come to a natural tan from an indoor bed.</li>

            <li> After you are done, use baby wipes to carefully and thoroughly wipe off your palms and in between your fingers.</li>
            <li> The only thing I would say negative, is that you have to be extra careful about rubbing it in between your fingers before you tan because it will leave orangish streaks in between them if you don&#x27;t!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to finish my other lotion</li>
            <li> The bottle is a pretty standard one and I really appreciate that, considering the other lotions I have tried have terrible packaging.</li>
            <li> Smell is average.  </li>
            <li> This will prevent those smears of bronzer that typically develop in these areas.</li>
            <li> and she is getting so dark!  </li>
            <li> Without this product I usually just burn and take forever to tan, if I even tan at all.</li>
            <li> Works just as well as some expensive brands I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li> This is unlike some other lotions I&#x27;ve tried that smell TERRIBLE after tanning, like you burnt the smell or something.</li>
            <li> For the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>

            <li> Good lotion at a good price.  Smell is average.  Gives a  good color for a tan. I rate it a 6 out of 10.</li>
            <li> I just bought this Lotion today. It smells SOOOO good!!!! I used a palm tree sticker to see how good the bronzers worked, and it looks like I have been tanning for a month! No greasy feeling either! GREAT stuff!</li>
            <li> This stuff smells amazing on!! Plus after you tan it smells even better, like warm berries!! This is unlike some other lotions I&#x27;ve tried that smell TERRIBLE after tanning, like you burnt the smell or something. This also does intensify my tan, without making me look orange. It&#x27;s very natural looking and with it&#x27;s help I&#x27;ve achieved a beautiful tan. Without this product I usually just burn and take forever to tan, if I even tan at all.</li>
            <li> Smells better than most indoor tanning lotions. Work well.</li>
            <li> Good stuff! Smells great, good color( not orange), shipped on time. For the price, can&#x27;t beat it!! Works just as well as some expensive brands I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li> Love this! Gives nice dark color without turning orange! Perfect for any tanning bed and any budget, and works quickly to achieve desired color!</li>
            <li> omg this smells so good.  I bought this for a coworker and she is getting so dark!  She loves this stuff too!</li>
            <li> This item is great! Smells very good and doesn&#x27;t leave a nasty residue on your skin after tanning! Would most definitely recommend it! (:</li>
            <li> This stuff smells like you jumped into a berry tank!! It&#x27;s a nice smell for tanning at least - Im not sure that&#x27;s its the best lotion, but it was worth the money cuz it was cheap and its better than using no lotion.</li>
            <li> I love the brand Supre and in my opinion they make some of the best tanning lotions out there.  I bought this one on eBay for about the same price, but I like to know when I&#x27;m getting my stuff so for certain stuff I&#x27;ll shop there instead.  I used this over the weekend to even out a tan I got from the river a couple weeks ago and after just one use, I had VERY noticeable results!  For the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> great product, natural looking color.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this lotion! All the girls in the tanning salon are always asking me about my lotion because it smells so good!!

            <li> Amazing. The only downside is it runs out very fast. But still the best quality tanning lotion I&#x27;ve used, smells good too</li>
            <li> The smell is fantastic im a very easy tanner so the bronzing agent in here does not really affect me but the lotion itself is a great quality lotion...and best smelling lotion I&#x27;ve ever come across!!((:</li>
            <li> Love it, smells great!</li>
            <li> This is my absolute favorite tanning lotion and honestly I regret wanting to try anything else. The smell is DEVINE. I am not normally a fan of &#x27;berry&#x27; smells but this is an exception to the rule. The bronzer is great and have me a nice, non-orange tan. The bottle is a pretty standard one and I really appreciate that, considering the other lotions I have tried have terrible packaging. I can&#x27;t wait to finish my other lotion so I can buy this one again. Bonus: it is the most inexpensive lotion I have tried! Excellent!!</li>
            <li> i give it three stars cause it smells so good ,but the bronzer needs some work</li>
            <li> Like it so much! Perfect!</li>
            <li> I am a red head so my skin ain&#x27;t easy to tan, but this is the only lotion I&#x27;ve found that makes me tan! Definitely my favorite tanning lotion and my husband loves the way it makes me smell</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many different indoor tanning products and this one has the greatest bang for your buck. It smells amazing, is streak-free, skin-firming, and you end with a dark, rich tan that looks like you spent the week in Cabo. I have olive undertones in my skin and the majority of indoor tanning bronzers leave me looking like a basketball (orange). This product is not only affordable, but produces as close as I&#x27;ve come to a natural tan from an indoor bed. If it mowed the lawn, I&#x27;d marry it. Buy this product with confidence, you will not be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A word of advice with ANY indoor tanning bronzer... take the time to rub the product into your skin very well. After you are done, use baby wipes to carefully and thoroughly wipe off your palms and in between your fingers. If your knee&#x27;s or elbows are particularly wrinkly, cleanse those areas with the baby wipe as well, PRIOR to getting into the tanning bed. This will prevent those smears of bronzer that typically develop in these areas.</li>
            <li> Works great and smells delicious too!</li>
            <li> Makes tanning salon smell like baked berry pie!  We have tried more expensive lotions but this the best for us.</li>
            <li> I get a nice bronze tan using Supre Berrylicious and it lives your skin soft and a nice pleasant scent</li>
            <li> This is a nice, thick, brozing lotion. The scent is great and it does give you that extra glow within the first few times of tanning with it. I would recomend this product.</li>
