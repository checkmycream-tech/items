            <li>I have very fine hair and was looking for a well made comb that would not damage it.</li>
            <li>I do own two of the Mason Pearson brushes in different sizes, but I think that this comb is the best value.  </li>
            <li>I am very happy with this comb because of the finish, it has no rough edges.</li>
            <li>I have bought many of these for self and gifts.  </li>

            <li>I love this comb...</li>
            <li>I love, love, love, this product.</li>
            <li>Love mason pearson products anyway, you will never have to buy another.</li>
            <li>I can feel the quality with this comb, and I do expect to keep this for many years to come.  </li>
            <li>I love the brushes but I do not recommend this comb.highly displeased.</li>
            <li>I place orders for more</li>
            <li>and I now love combing my hair.</li>
            <li>This is the perfect comb if you have long hair.  </li>
            <li>This comb is very sleek, feelings good.  </li>
            <li>This is the BEST wide tooth comb I have ever used!  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair that gets tangled easily.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine , and I use a conditioner/detangler every day.</li>
            <li>This comb and Kent combs, also sold here at Amazon, are finely made and smooth as silk..</li>
            <li>I got this comb after going through two cheap combs I got from target.</li>
            <li>Well made, beautifully colored, so smooth on my long hair,</li>
            <li>I need a seamless comb and heard good things about this one.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised that the comb is just as good.  </li>
            <li>This comb is great to use for tangled long fine hair.</li>
            <li>but WELL WORTH it!</li>
            <li>I was never a comb user, but I thought that using a wide-toothed comb would be fun!  </li>
            <li>The gaps make it easier to clean when there&#x27;s a build-up of hair product.</li>
            <li>Seamless comb that is often touted on long hair websites as being the best.  </li>
            <li>attractive wide toothed comb.  </li>
            <li>Love this comb, if its possible to love a comb.</li>
            <li>However, my hair is very manageable, and a $3 plastic comb I had before this one worked fine for over a year.</li>
            <li>but if you want to grow your hair you should never brush it wet and a good comb</li>
            <li>I also have the bristle/nylon brush and they are both worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I realize it is a bit of monies for the brush but worth it.</li>
            <li>well worth it</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m using a Sephora comb that costs half as much and works great.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try the Mason Pearson comb as the brand has a reputation for high quality.</li>
            <li>I bought this comb for wet tangles thinking it would be good at getting them out without too much pain.</li>
            <li>The teeth are spaced perfectly so that it has no trouble getting through my thick mane.</li>
            <li>thanks!</li>
            <li>Fast Shipping too!</li>
            <li>The comb itself is also larger than most styling combs, so it&#x27;s easier to hold.</li>
            <li>The comb broke the first time I tried it.</li>
            <li>My first Mason Pearson Comb I bought in Germany in 1984</li>
            <li>I wanted something that was better quality than the cheap drug store black combs, so I decided to get this comb.</li>
            <li>These combs have stood through several years of heavy use and still look and work beautifully.  </li>
            <li>I believed that this was a geniune Mason Pearson comb, and when I received my comb, it certainly looked \\&quot;official\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Because of the wider gap between teeth, the grooves left in my hair when coming aren&#x27;t as fine, which I like.</li>
            <li>It is just large enough and the finish is smooth.</li>
            <li>I would have expected Mason Pearson to have a better product.</li>
            <li>It does both really well.</li>
            <li>This one is much stronger than those.</li>
            <li>Like many other customers, one of the teeth broke on mine as well.  </li>
            <li>Unlike other, cheaper wide tooth combs, this one eliminates almost all static, has smooth teeth that don&#x27;t scratch the scalp, and the plastic does not peel off (which can increase hair breakage).  </li>
            <li>High quality product.  </li>
            <li>I guess this one must be good for those who have very thick hair.  </li>
            <li>A lot of women use it for detangling, but I use it like a normal comb.</li>
            <li>It works great for my long thick hair...</li>
            <li>Live and learn.</li>
            <li>Based on the reviews I read, I expected the comb to last for many years.</li>
            <li>Smooth, does not snag or snarl, does not break down with use.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I find myself just casually grazing the teeth of this comb on my scalp because it feels good.</li>
            <li>The only downside is that it is harder to get a clean part on the side when I comb my hair over.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m and African American female and finding a good quality comb is hard.</li>
            <li>It is sooooo soft on the scalp but also, (I can only speak for myself)</li>
            <li>Sadly, I&#x27;m back to my $3 shower comb until I find a replacement seamless comb.</li>
            <li>the price is a bit high, but they are totally worth it, and I never had one where the teeth broke, anyway the Company stay behind their product, so if that ever should happen, they would send You a new one.</li>
            <li>if you have a Mason Pearson brush and want a matching comb, and don&#x27;t mind spending way more than you need to (haha that sounds so crazy)</li>
            <li>My Aveda wide tooth comb finally lost a couple of teeth after 4 years, so it was time for a new one.</li>
            <li>I have thick fine textured hair that breaks easily, especially when wet.  </li>

            <li> I have long curly hair, and I suddenly realize that they are getting frizzy, so I checked My comb in the bathroom and notice that they have seem inside, so I thought, &amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Does not snag at my long wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I have natural, curly, thick african american hair.</li>
            <li> Clearly, it is not.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and this comb helps to comb the conditioner through while in the shower!</li>
            <li> In less than 10 times use (not even a month), the middle tooth broke off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this comb on dry hair and on wet hair, with product and without...</li>
            <li> I am a female with long hair and use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Being a rake comb, it does comb your hair a little bit differently, although Mason Pearson does sell a fine-tooth comb [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I use my Mason Pearson Rake Comb to detangle my hair when wet and in the morning to get the knots out.  </li>
            <li> I have used a wide tooth comb for years.  </li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s a bit wide for my wet hair.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps I was too rough on it, although I do not think I was using it as a hair rake.</li>
            <li> I like to comb conditioners and oils through wet hair which is almost to my waist</li>
            <li> One spoke of the comb snapped off and my hair was not very knotted.</li>
            <li> I use this on my wet hair</li>
            <li> Not what I expected for thirty dollars.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it for delicate thick hair or for coarse or curly hair</li>
            <li> However, one of the teeth in the comb broke this past weekend (October), which is totally unacceptable for a comb at this price.  </li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve seen in other reviews, I&#x27;m now using a $3 comb that has outlasted this one.</li>
            <li> However, the comb is definitely not worth the price.</li>
            <li> Problem is it broke in less than a year.</li>
            <li> This comb lasted less than 4 months before the teeth started breaking out.</li>
            <li> A little pricey, but</li>
            <li> It is firm (no bending) and doesn&#x27;t rip out your hair.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, long wavy hair.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t too rough to the point where it&#x27;s ripping out hair, but it also isn&#x27;t so weak that it doesn&#x27;t detangle.</li>
            <li> I was obsessed with Mason Pearson brush for a long time.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s hard to comb.  </li>
            <li> so that I&#x27;ll never encounter a situation where I&#x27;ll have to untangle my thick, mid-back length hair with anything else.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t have the thick hair anymore as I used to.  </li>
            <li> It still strips the hair if you let the base of the comb, where the teeth begin, run down your hair.</li>
            <li> The price is relatively expensive for a comb</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t failed me yet</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I am very disappointed with the quality of this product.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in this product.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> Yes, $25 Is a lot for a comb but if you want to grow your hair you should never brush it wet and a good comb it essential to prevent breakage. I would definitely recommend this comb. I also have the bristle/nylon brush and they are both worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I used this comb 5 times to apply conditioner to my hair and one tooth in the middle of the comb broke off. Needless to say, I am very disappointed with the quality of this product. I would have expected Mason Pearson to have a better product. I use the Mason Pearson Detangler Comb and Popular Brush and love both products. However, the comb is definitely not worth the price. Save your money and do not buy this product!</li>
            <li> I have bought many of these for self and gifts.  I love them.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST wide tooth comb I have ever used!  I have thick fine textured hair that breaks easily, especially when wet.  I use my Mason Pearson Rake Comb to detangle my hair when wet and in the morning to get the knots out.  Unlike other, cheaper wide tooth combs, this one eliminates almost all static, has smooth teeth that don&#x27;t scratch the scalp, and the plastic does not peel off (which can increase hair breakage).  I would highly recommend it for delicate thick hair or for coarse or curly hair that&#x27;s hard to comb.  The price is relatively expensive for a comb but WELL WORTH it!</li>
            <li> I love this comb! It is sooooo soft on the scalp but also, (I can only speak for myself) detangles well without pulling out excess hair!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m and African American female and finding a good quality comb is hard. I love this comb! It isn&#x27;t too rough to the point where it&#x27;s ripping out hair, but it also isn&#x27;t so weak that it doesn&#x27;t detangle. It does both really well. Sometimes I find myself just casually grazing the teeth of this comb on my scalp because it feels good. I say INVEST! You won&#x27;t regret this comb.</li>
            <li> Well made, beautifully colored, so smooth on my long hair, Best comb on the market. I love this comb alot!</li>
            <li> I have very thick, long wavy hair. I bought this comb for wet tangles thinking it would be good at getting them out without too much pain. It was for about a week until two of the teeth broke off. I didn&#x27;t save my packaging and didn&#x27;t feel like sending it back, so now it is in the trash and I&#x27;m using a Sephora comb that costs half as much and works great.</li>
            <li> I have been using Mason Pearson&#x27;s bristle/nylon brush for over a year, and it has been great. I wanted a comb for my shower so I bought this one. In less than 10 times use (not even a month), the middle tooth broke off. I have fine hair that gets tangled easily. However, my hair is very manageable, and a $3 plastic comb I had before this one worked fine for over a year. Based on the reviews I read, I expected the comb to last for many years. Perhaps the comb I received was defective. Regardless, I am very upset that $25 was wasted.</li>
            <li> I love this comb...I actually own 3 so that I&#x27;ll never encounter a situation where I&#x27;ll have to untangle my thick, mid-back length hair with anything else. The teeth are spaced perfectly so that it has no trouble getting through my thick mane. I&#x27;ve used this comb on dry hair and on wet hair, with product and without...performs marvelously in all scenarios. I&#x27;ve never had a problem with it snagging my hair, an issue I&#x27;ve had with cheaper, plastic combs.  I do own two of the Mason Pearson brushes in different sizes, but I think that this comb is the best value.  These combs have stood through several years of heavy use and still look and work beautifully.  I would purchase them again in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li> I have used a wide tooth comb for years.  Perfect for hair that tangles easily.  The Mason Pearson Rake Style Comb is absolutely the best.  It is just large enough and the finish is smooth.</li>
            <li> I purchased this comb on May 10, 2011. I have natural, curly, thick african american hair. I need a seamless comb and heard good things about this one. However, one of the teeth in the comb broke this past weekend (October), which is totally unacceptable for a comb at this price.  Sadly, I&#x27;m back to my $3 shower comb until I find a replacement seamless comb. I believed that this was a geniune Mason Pearson comb, and when I received my comb, it certainly looked \\&quot;official\\&quot;. Clearly, it is not. I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love, this product. I&#x27;ve used Mason Pearson combs and brushes for 20 years and just can&#x27;t imagine using a drug store plastic comb. They feel so good in your hair, do not cause static and feel so good in your hand. I lost my rake comb and was thrilled to see that I could purchase one at Amazon.....thanks!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT! Still have years later and it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> I love this comb! I have long hair and this comb helps to comb the conditioner through while in the shower! I like it because some of the plastic combs that you get in the store, well the plastic starts to peel off and then when you try to use it in your hair, the plastic snags your hair. Love mason pearson products anyway, you will never have to buy another. Fast Shipping too!</li>
            <li> Love these combs!  Smooth, does not snag or snarl, does not break down with use. My second comb so I could carry one with me.</li>
            <li> If you have curly hair this is a great comb for combing out the tangles in the shower. It is firm (no bending) and doesn&#x27;t rip out your hair.</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time and as advertised. another great product from Mason Pearson</li>
            <li> It is the best brush. Invigorates your scalp and makes my hair shine. I realize it is a bit of monies for the brush but worth it.</li>
            <li> I was obsessed with Mason Pearson brush for a long time.  Finally, I made the order.  I&#x27;ll review the brush seprately.  For this comb, I wanted to use it when I use Wen hair cleanser. This comb is very sleek, feelings good.  But it&#x27;s a bit wide for my wet hair.  I guess this one must be good for those who have very thick hair.  Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t have the thick hair anymore as I used to.  The reason that I give it 3 stars because the price.</li>
            <li> For $35, this comb should be sturdier.  Like many other customers, one of the teeth broke on mine as well.  I have a dollar store Goody brand rake comb that is still perfect after a decade.  Live and learn.</li>
            <li> I was never a comb user, but I thought that using a wide-toothed comb would be fun!  Yeah, so I use it when I get out of the shower to de-tangle.  High quality product.  A little pricey, but if you have a Mason Pearson brush and want a matching comb, and don&#x27;t mind spending way more than you need to (haha that sounds so crazy) this is the comb for you!</li>
            <li> I bought this comb after reading about it in a men&#x27;s grooming blog post. The blogger said he had his for 15 years. I wanted something that was better quality than the cheap drug store black combs, so I decided to get this comb. Being a rake comb, it does comb your hair a little bit differently, although Mason Pearson does sell a fine-tooth comb [[ASIN:B000RU3RRQ Mason Pearson Styling Comb]]. A lot of women use it for detangling, but I use it like a normal comb. I can feel the quality with this comb, and I do expect to keep this for many years to come.  Because of the wider gap between teeth, the grooves left in my hair when coming aren&#x27;t as fine, which I like. The only downside is that it is harder to get a clean part on the side when I comb my hair over. The comb itself is also larger than most styling combs, so it&#x27;s easier to hold. The gaps make it easier to clean when there&#x27;s a build-up of hair product.</li>
            <li> Seamless comb that is often touted on long hair websites as being the best.  It is good. Problem is it broke in less than a year. Perhaps I was too rough on it, although I do not think I was using it as a hair rake. Should have held up longer.</li>
            <li> I have owned a Mason Pearson brush for over 10 years.  I was pleasantly surprised that the comb is just as good.  Does not snag at my long wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I will never use another brand comb on my hair.  This comb is great to use for tangled long fine hair.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and was looking for a well made comb that would not damage it. I am very happy with this comb because of the finish, it has no rough edges.</li>
            <li> Love this comb, if its possible to love a comb.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect comb if you have long hair.  I like to comb conditioners and oils through wet hair which is almost to my waist and this comb allows me to do it without ripping out my hair.  Mason Pearson products are always great.  I have the &amp;#34;Popular&amp;#34; brush in two sizes and the extra-long 100% boar and various combs.  This comb and Kent combs, also sold here at Amazon, are finely made and smooth as silk..</li>
            <li> The comb broke the first time I tried it. One spoke of the comb snapped off and my hair was not very knotted. I love the brushes but I do not recommend this comb.highly displeased.</li>
            <li> I got this comb after going through two cheap combs I got from target. This one is much stronger than those. I am a female with long hair and use it everyday. It hasn&#x27;t failed me yet and I&#x27;ve had it for 4 months now.</li>
            <li> This brand will be the only comb I will use in my hair from now on it is the best out there yes they are pricey but well worth it I place orders for more</li>
            <li> attractive wide toothed comb.  doesn&#x27;t tangle</li>
            <li> I was excited to try the Mason Pearson comb as the brand has a reputation for high quality. My Aveda wide tooth comb finally lost a couple of teeth after 4 years, so it was time for a new one. This comb lasted less than 4 months before the teeth started breaking out. My hair is fine , and I use a conditioner/detangler every day. Thus, there was no undue stress put on the comb that would account for the teeth coming out. I was very disappointed in this product. As I&#x27;ve seen in other reviews, I&#x27;m now using a $3 comb that has outlasted this one.</li>
            <li> My first Mason Pearson Comb I bought in Germany in 1984, I had it until 1997 until I borrowed it to an acquaintance in a Restaurant, the next morning I couldn&#x27;t find it in My handbag and I never saw the lady anymore, in 1998 I went to Italy and I found another one, this one I still have, but it&#x27;s always in My handbag. I have long curly hair, and I suddenly realize that they are getting frizzy, so I checked My comb in the bathroom and notice that they have seem inside, so I thought, &amp;#34; now that We have the Internet it shouldn&#x27;t be to difficult to find another Mason Pearson Comb to have in My bathroom,&amp;#34; Boy was I glad when I saw them here, o.k. the price is a bit high, but they are totally worth it, and I never had one where the teeth broke, anyway the Company stay behind their product, so if that ever should happen, they would send You a new one. I&#x27;m very happy to have another one, and Goodbye Frizz</li>
            <li> Love this comb for my Coton de Tulear!!! Perfect!!</li>
            <li> Glides through my hair so nicely. I use this on my wet hair and I now love combing my hair.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this comb!  It works great for my long thick hair...I do not know how I have survived without it.  I will be purchasing more for the rest of my family!!</li>
            <li> What a great comb.  Good for your hair.  It does make a difference</li>
            <li> I am a cult addict for all Mason&#x27;s brushes. This was another one to add to my collection.</li>
            <li> It still strips the hair if you let the base of the comb, where the teeth begin, run down your hair. Not what I expected for thirty dollars.</li>
