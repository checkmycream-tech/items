            <li>Love using this when drying my hair.</li>
            <li>I love this product it seems to work well with my hair.</li>
            <li>I had tried SOOO many products, so I figured I would try one more, before accepting that my hair was permanently damaged</li>
            <li>I like the scent of the keratin shampoo, conditioner, and mask more than the leave in scent.  </li>
            <li>No pun intended :)</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love the keratin line of products.  </li>
            <li>I love it, it makes my hair smoother and shinier.</li>
            <li>She told me not to even think about touching my hair dryer.</li>
            <li>It will take two weeks of letting it go three days or more without using shampoo but your scalp will adjust and stop over producing oil trying to overcompensate for over washing.</li>
            <li>so the top was cracked an leaked everywhere ;(</li>
            <li>I love this oil I put a ton of this oil in my hair and let it stay on for 24 hours</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s flat ironed and it works perfectly!</li>
            <li>This is a great product for keeping down my fly away hairs.</li>
            <li>I like this product very much and feels so good in hair..</li>
            <li>I can do either and my hair, with regular trims look gorgeous and smells even MORE gorgeous</li>
            <li>My hair transformed to soft, silky, manageable, strong, sexy, beautiful hair.</li>
            <li>Great product, my hair is soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>I use this product every other day and it works wonderful.</li>
            <li>I have tried other products but this has given me the best results.</li>
            <li>Smells awesome, and really leaves the hair soft.  </li>
            <li>(Also, it doesn&#x27;t have a strong fragrance to it, in case anyone is wondering.</li>
            <li>It smelled like a strong chemical fragrance.  </li>
            <li>but this makes it look very healthy, thanks to my Son recommending it to me...</li>
            <li>I love this oil sooo much!!</li>
            <li>Was recommended to me by my primary care doctor.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoy all the</li>
            <li>After using this, my hair is smooth and I can run my fingers through it without getting covered in gunk.  </li>
            <li>Makes it smooth, not oily.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic price.  </li>
            <li>So happy a product finally delivers.</li>
            <li>She used it as a blow drying serum which made my hair look silky and smooth.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li>Nothing worked to get my hair sleek and smooth.</li>
            <li>This stuff makes your hair smell good and soft.  </li>
            <li>The daily conditioner is gentle and light enough to be the perfect cleansing conditioner, just like Wen but BETTER!</li>
            <li>It smells great and even without blowdrying, it helps my hair dry fairly quickly and leaves my hair feeling silky smooth.</li>
            <li>To put it simply, Aldehyde is Formaldehyde with a pleasant odor.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair very smooth, although you don&#x27;t need much...</li>
            <li>Love this product so much.</li>
            <li>and it definitely helps my hair to look good.</li>
            <li>Rinse well for five minutes in COOL water.</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite because it&#x27;s light on my hair and doesn&#x27;t leave it feeling too oily.</li>
            <li>I gave four stars because I don&#x27;t feel that it is a \\&quot;miracle\\&quot;  oil but the very first time I used it</li>
            <li>Works great and does not weigh your hair down.</li>
            <li>I did notice a difference in my hair, less frizzies and fly aways.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, the normal daily products work great.</li>
            <li>This is a great hair care line and the shampoo has no lauryl sulfate which is harsh on my hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but totally worth it.  </li>
            <li>My favorite hair oil it makes your hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>It is well worth the $25.  </li>
            <li>I love how soft it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li>healthy looking and soft.</li>
            <li>I love the way it smells and my hair feels so soft after I use it.</li>
            <li>One day, my best friends mother, a curly hair victim herself, added some Redken gel to my wet hair, finger combed it and put it up in a towel.</li>
            <li>at a Smart Style Salon!</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping .&lt;br</li>
            <li>Helps control the frizz on my hair nicely and helps it dry faster when blow drying.</li>
            <li>I bought a great flat iron, a step above Chi, even.</li>
            <li>It puts the smoothness and sheen back into her hair and people always comment on how healthy it looks.</li>
            <li>I love this oil and could use larger bottles.</li>
            <li>Not only does it make it look healthy and shiney</li>
            <li>Works wonders, after about a week of using it every other day, my hair was feeling healthy again!</li>
            <li>This is a bargain, pretty close to the wholesale price, so snap it up.</li>
            <li>First I have to say that I have severely damaged hair.</li>
            <li>Look how soft and smooth my hair is with it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely be buying it from here more often.</li>
            <li>This really works if you are loosing hair!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve tried many different products from Russia, Germany, Japan, Iran, and Kazakhstan.</li>
            <li>It shines for the first time in my life.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first time I&#x27;ve tried it.</li>
            <li>It is really a miracle oil!</li>

            <li>I started to used first in the Beauty Salon and when I came out all my friend started to tell me that my hair  was very shine.</li>

            <li>I love this product for my dry hair.  </li>
            <li>This product has such a strong dose of chemicals that it&#x27;s been an hour since I put it in my hair</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much of the product.</li>
            <li>It really does make your hair , well, glow.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really see the difference.</li>
            <li>My hair shines and is absolutely stronger.</li>

            <li>it definitely keeps the frizz down,even on super hot or humid days.</li>
            <li>so the first time I tried this I was very surprised</li>
            <li>This oil works better than any other I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the cost and easy to afford on Amazon, plus you need so little of everything.</li>

            <li>A full order of everything is about 80.00 and that last&#x27;s me</li>
            <li>I have recently become interested in natural moisturizing oils and this little bottle is packed with the good stuff.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll use only this for a good long while because I like it and its related products so much.</li>
            <li>It really makes my hair silky, soft and very manageable.  </li>
            <li>I have super coarse, frizzy, wavy hair</li>

            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone who want to experience a life changing transformation with their hair.</li>
            <li>i highly recommend.&lt;br</li>
            <li>You have to know how to take care of your hair, but this is definitely the first step!</li>
            <li>I use a little more that recommended and it does not make my hair look oily.</li>
            <li>If there&#x27;s some frizz a little more of each the oil and spray once try</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, it just doesn&#x27;t smell as wonderful as the others.  </li>
            <li>All were &#x27;okay&#x27; and helped my hair to look healthier, but still not smooth and controlled.</li>
            <li>Smooths it beautifully and does not make the hair feel sticky, heavy or limp.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle Deep Conditioner Plus Keratin deep conditioner and Shampoo, it stays silky smooth.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, after using this product, with using no straightening irons or damaging heat styling tools, my hair had more breakage and dryness than it did originally.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and just didn&#x27;t like the product because it left my ends dry.</li>
            <li>My hair rarely looks frazzeled and dry.</li>
            <li>‚Ä¶ I have fine wavy waist length hair and this softens my hair ends without leaving them greasy or heavy.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ve all seen one; a girl with huge, fluffy, often wavy, uncontrollable hair.</li>
            <li>my hairs are so soft and silky with it.</li>
            <li>and it makes it so soft and tames my flyaways.</li>
            <li>I have naturally wavy hair</li>
            <li>so when I straighten it tends to be not so soft,</li>
            <li>But since I have been using this product it makes my hair so soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>This is the only product out of the whole line that does the &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; for me.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair look alive.</li>
            <li>By the way I have natural hair</li>
            <li>Makes my hair soft and silky and with a non-greasy shine.</li>
            <li>It was reducing my natural curls and at times made my scalp itch.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s leaves it soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>Leaves hair so soft.</li>
            <li>The keratin keeps my hair smooth and shiny without the heavy oily feel.</li>
            <li>you are in any way sensitive to perfumes or chemicals, I would recommend avoiding this product.</li>
            <li>and then I shampoo my hair and my hair is so soft.</li>
            <li>This is the only product that works on my Granddaughters long super curly hair ...</li>
            <li>moment; I was trying to blow dry very fine textured, thick in quantity, frizz prone curly hair straight with no tools to do the job</li>
            <li>Deep condition once a week with one of your shampoo days and in a month you will have all new</li>
            <li>Deep condition once a week with one of your shampoo days and in a month you will have all new</li>
            <li>It is an okay product and might work for someone with not so thick and  coarse hair like mine.</li>
            <li>Makes your hair instantly manageable and soft.</li>
            <li>I woke up one day around 12, 13 years old with what I affectionately call \\&quot;White girl fro\\&quot; hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is currently very long (below my elbows) and fairly damaged at the bottom due to the fact that I am seriously overdue for a haircut.</li>
            <li>Made my curly thick hair calm and moisturized!</li>
            <li>Really helps manage my thick hair and makes it very soft as well!</li>
            <li>Nothing can repair broken hair, hair is dead but this product keeps freshly trimmed locks healthy and prevents breakage and split ends unlike any other.</li>

            <li> Love using this when drying my hair.</li>
            <li> I love this product it seems to work well with my hair.</li>
            <li> I had tried SOOO many products, so I figured I would try one more, before accepting that my hair was permanently damaged</li>
            <li> I like the scent of the keratin shampoo, conditioner, and mask more than the leave in scent.  </li>
            <li> No pun intended :)</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love the keratin line of products.  </li>
            <li> I love it, it makes my hair smoother and shinier.</li>
            <li> She told me not to even think about touching my hair dryer.</li>
            <li> It will take two weeks of letting it go three days or more without using shampoo but your scalp will adjust and stop over producing oil trying to overcompensate for over washing.</li>
            <li> so the top was cracked an leaked everywhere ;(</li>
            <li> I love this oil I put a ton of this oil in my hair and let it stay on for 24 hours</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s flat ironed and it works perfectly!</li>
            <li> This is a great product for keeping down my fly away hairs.</li>
            <li> I like this product very much and feels so good in hair..</li>
            <li> I can do either and my hair, with regular trims look gorgeous and smells even MORE gorgeous</li>
            <li> My hair transformed to soft, silky, manageable, strong, sexy, beautiful hair.</li>
            <li> Great product, my hair is soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I use this product every other day and it works wonderful.</li>
            <li> I have tried other products but this has given me the best results.</li>
            <li> Smells awesome, and really leaves the hair soft.  </li>
            <li> (Also, it doesn&#x27;t have a strong fragrance to it, in case anyone is wondering.</li>
            <li> It smelled like a strong chemical fragrance.  </li>
            <li> but this makes it look very healthy, thanks to my Son recommending it to me...</li>
            <li> I love this oil sooo much!!</li>
            <li> Was recommended to me by my primary care doctor.  </li>
            <li> I really enjoy all the</li>
            <li> After using this, my hair is smooth and I can run my fingers through it without getting covered in gunk.  </li>
            <li> Makes it smooth, not oily.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic price.  </li>
            <li> So happy a product finally delivers.</li>
            <li> She used it as a blow drying serum which made my hair look silky and smooth.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li> Nothing worked to get my hair sleek and smooth.</li>
            <li> This stuff makes your hair smell good and soft.  </li>
            <li> The daily conditioner is gentle and light enough to be the perfect cleansing conditioner, just like Wen but BETTER!</li>
            <li> It smells great and even without blowdrying, it helps my hair dry fairly quickly and leaves my hair feeling silky smooth.</li>
            <li> To put it simply, Aldehyde is Formaldehyde with a pleasant odor.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair very smooth, although you don&#x27;t need much...</li>
            <li> Love this product so much.</li>
            <li> and it definitely helps my hair to look good.</li>
            <li> Rinse well for five minutes in COOL water.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite because it&#x27;s light on my hair and doesn&#x27;t leave it feeling too oily.</li>
            <li> I gave four stars because I don&#x27;t feel that it is a \\&quot;miracle\\&quot;  oil but the very first time I used it</li>
            <li> Works great and does not weigh your hair down.</li>
            <li> I did notice a difference in my hair, less frizzies and fly aways.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, the normal daily products work great.</li>
            <li> This is a great hair care line and the shampoo has no lauryl sulfate which is harsh on my hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but totally worth it.  </li>
            <li> My favorite hair oil it makes your hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> It is well worth the $25.  </li>
            <li> I love how soft it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li> healthy looking and soft.</li>
            <li> I love the way it smells and my hair feels so soft after I use it.</li>
            <li> One day, my best friends mother, a curly hair victim herself, added some Redken gel to my wet hair, finger combed it and put it up in a towel.</li>
            <li> at a Smart Style Salon!</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping .&lt;br</li>
            <li> Helps control the frizz on my hair nicely and helps it dry faster when blow drying.</li>
            <li> I bought a great flat iron, a step above Chi, even.</li>
            <li> It puts the smoothness and sheen back into her hair and people always comment on how healthy it looks.</li>
            <li> I love this oil and could use larger bottles.</li>
            <li> Not only does it make it look healthy and shiney</li>
            <li> Works wonders, after about a week of using it every other day, my hair was feeling healthy again!</li>
            <li> This is a bargain, pretty close to the wholesale price, so snap it up.</li>
            <li> First I have to say that I have severely damaged hair.</li>
            <li> Look how soft and smooth my hair is with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely be buying it from here more often.</li>
            <li> This really works if you are loosing hair!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried many different products from Russia, Germany, Japan, Iran, and Kazakhstan.</li>
            <li> It shines for the first time in my life.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first time I&#x27;ve tried it.</li>
            <li> It is really a miracle oil!</li>
            <li> My hair is so much softer and shinier too!  </li>
            <li> First the grocery store brands-</li>
            <li> Soft, smooth curls will await you.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it, and I will DEFINITELY be purchasing this again, especially since I get such a great deal from Amazon!</li>
            <li> I started to used first in the Beauty Salon and when I came out all my friend started to tell me that my hair  was very shine.</li>
            <li> So for the price, this should go a very long way:)</li>
            <li> Makes my hair super soft.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before and love it because my hair tends to be dry but this softens it up.  </li>
            <li> I love this product for my dry hair.  </li>
            <li> This product has such a strong dose of chemicals that it&#x27;s been an hour since I put it in my hair</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need much of the product.</li>
            <li> It really does make your hair , well, glow.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really see the difference.</li>
            <li> My hair shines and is absolutely stronger.</li>
            <li> It really is a 10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> thanks to</li>
            <li> I add it to wet hair, scrunch, two more sprays leave in and up in a towel.</li>
            <li> it definitely keeps the frizz down,even on super hot or humid days.</li>
            <li> so the first time I tried this I was very surprised</li>
            <li> This oil works better than any other I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the cost and easy to afford on Amazon, plus you need so little of everything.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the cost and easy to afford on Amazon, plus you need so little of everything.</li>
            <li> It also makes my hair pretty soft.</li>
            <li> A full order of everything is about 80.00 and that last&#x27;s me</li>
            <li> A full order of everything is about 80.00 and that last&#x27;s me</li>
            <li> I have recently become interested in natural moisturizing oils and this little bottle is packed with the good stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll use only this for a good long while because I like it and its related products so much.</li>
            <li> It really makes my hair silky, soft and very manageable.  </li>
            <li> I have super coarse, frizzy, wavy hair</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it....</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it.</li>

            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone who want to experience a life changing transformation with their hair.</li>
            <li> i highly recommend.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You have to know how to take care of your hair, but this is definitely the first step!</li>
            <li> I use a little more that recommended and it does not make my hair look oily.</li>
            <li> If there&#x27;s some frizz a little more of each the oil and spray once try</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, it just doesn&#x27;t smell as wonderful as the others.  </li>
            <li> All were &#x27;okay&#x27; and helped my hair to look healthier, but still not smooth and controlled.</li>
            <li> Smooths it beautifully and does not make the hair feel sticky, heavy or limp.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle Deep Conditioner Plus Keratin deep conditioner and Shampoo, it stays silky smooth.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, after using this product, with using no straightening irons or damaging heat styling tools, my hair had more breakage and dryness than it did originally.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and just didn&#x27;t like the product because it left my ends dry.</li>
            <li> My hair rarely looks frazzeled and dry.</li>
            <li> ‚Ä¶ I have fine wavy waist length hair and this softens my hair ends without leaving them greasy or heavy.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ve all seen one; a girl with huge, fluffy, often wavy, uncontrollable hair.</li>
            <li> my hairs are so soft and silky with it.</li>
            <li> and it makes it so soft and tames my flyaways.</li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy hair</li>
            <li> so when I straighten it tends to be not so soft,</li>
            <li> But since I have been using this product it makes my hair so soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> This is the only product out of the whole line that does the &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; for me.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair look alive.</li>
            <li> By the way I have natural hair</li>
            <li> Makes my hair soft and silky and with a non-greasy shine.</li>
            <li> It was reducing my natural curls and at times made my scalp itch.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s leaves it soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li> Leaves hair so soft.</li>
            <li> The keratin keeps my hair smooth and shiny without the heavy oily feel.</li>
            <li> you are in any way sensitive to perfumes or chemicals, I would recommend avoiding this product.</li>
            <li> and then I shampoo my hair and my hair is so soft.</li>
            <li> This is the only product that works on my Granddaughters long super curly hair ...</li>
            <li> moment; I was trying to blow dry very fine textured, thick in quantity, frizz prone curly hair straight with no tools to do the job</li>
            <li> Deep condition once a week with one of your shampoo days and in a month you will have all new</li>
            <li> Deep condition once a week with one of your shampoo days and in a month you will have all new</li>
            <li> It is an okay product and might work for someone with not so thick and  coarse hair like mine.</li>
            <li> Makes your hair instantly manageable and soft.</li>
            <li> I woke up one day around 12, 13 years old with what I affectionately call \\&quot;White girl fro\\&quot; hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is currently very long (below my elbows) and fairly damaged at the bottom due to the fact that I am seriously overdue for a haircut.</li>
            <li> Made my curly thick hair calm and moisturized!</li>
            <li> Really helps manage my thick hair and makes it very soft as well!</li>
            <li> Nothing can repair broken hair, hair is dead but this product keeps freshly trimmed locks healthy and prevents breakage and split ends unlike any other.</li>
            <li> Too much makes your hair greasy looking - a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I use this on my extremely damaged hair and it makes it feel so soft.</li>
            <li> On straight days I do the same routine, letting my hair towel dry as long as possible before blow drying with my fingers (again, less breakage and frizzing) and then flat iron adding extra oil as I</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this for anyone with harsh, color treated hair.  </li>
            <li> This is very concentrated, you will need just a small amount.</li>
            <li> I dealt with frizz and tangles my whole life until I started to use these products, finaly no more paid as I style and brush .</li>
            <li> I use it after I flat iron my hair</li>
            <li> Before I style, on damp or dry hair I add THREE drops of the Miracle Argon Oil to my long, mid back length hair and work in well.</li>
            <li> I use it on dry hair (before I use the shampoo, hair mask and leave in) and it instantly detangles and adds shine.</li>
            <li> My frizzy hair is now stronger, healthier, shiny and far less frizzy.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;i like to use it before bed on dry hair to prevent a big crazy &#x27;blonde tubmleweed&#x27; head in the morning :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even used Wen because I have such dry hair but even that pales in comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;d pay the price for this again, but it was a decent buy.</li>
            <li> I rub some on my hands and apply to my dry hair before I flat iron it</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft, shiny, frizz-free, it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down, it protects against heat styling damage, AND it is non-greasy (yay!)</li>
            <li> I tend to shy away from most products because I don&#x27;t like the greasy, weighed down feeling they give me.  </li>
            <li> I gave up, I was a chronic victim of Ponytail headaches, trapped in a world left without style and unable to partake in fun, new hairstyles.</li>
            <li> This a miracle for myself and my husband&#x27;s long hair!</li>
            <li> Purchased it when I had very long hair</li>
            <li> If I am in a hurry, I will just shampoo my hair, towel dry, and put some mask product in my hair, comb it through and go.  </li>
            <li> Plus my hair blow dry time has been dramatically reduced from 15 minutes to 7 minutes.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a 10 miracle oil plus keratin in my damaged, dry, breaking hair, it was like a miracle.</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time, you really only need a little.</li>
            <li> I use it on wet AND dry hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is natuarally very dry.</li>
            <li> Having always had soft, thick, straight hair I could not figure out why all of the sudden my blow dryer was my worst enemy; the harder I tried to tame the beast, the larger and more ferocious it grew.</li>
            <li> Only need a little bit.  </li>
            <li> WOW - I read that the presence of Formaldehyde is common with Keratin containing products!?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Use it everyday, sometimes multiple times a day.</li>
            <li> Exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> my hair is dyed blonde and it&#x27;s damaged and dried out.</li>
            <li> and this is the only thing that works to tame it.  </li>
            <li> I know it feels weird and gross the first few times</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Other products feel greasy on my hair and doesn&#x27;t stop the frizzes</li>
            <li> Had heard of this product from other people and wanted to try it.</li>
            <li> (my fault for not reading the description carefully), but ended up liking the oil as well!</li>
            <li> I do this every OTHER day.</li>
            <li> My thin spots are even growing new hair again because, well...my thyroid is now under control, but also because my scalp and it&#x27;s PH and hair follicles are all healthier.</li>
            <li> My thin spots are even growing new hair again because, well...my thyroid is now under control, but also because my scalp and it&#x27;s PH and hair follicles are all healthier.</li>
            <li> I use it on wet hair when I feel a little frizzy, and sometimes will scrunch this in my waves or piece out my ends with it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair</li>
            <li> An hour went by and when I took the towel off curls cascaded down my face.</li>
            <li> The rate im going with using it everyday, it will last at least a year.  </li>
            <li> I have long thick hair</li>
            <li> I have thick dry hair.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick coarse (think horse mane) wavy slightly curly hair..</li>
            <li> I use a little and rub into ends and my hair just drinks it up.</li>
            <li> A little leave in at the length, not the scalp and your hair will thank you.</li>
            <li> Dead hair</li>
            <li> , probably it isn&#x27;t, since my hair is just dead.</li>
            <li> That helped some but killed the one thing</li>
            <li> Two kids and a broken thyroid later</li>
            <li> Trust me, this WILL work after a few attempts.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a 10 with Keratin products that are helping to repair the damage caused by my previous stylist over processing my hair!</li>
            <li> actually, after a dramatic hair salon incident.</li>
            <li> will tame that.</li>
            <li> She said it is a little expensive, but a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> and it was now limp, thinning and dull as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it almost everyday!</li>
            <li> I usually can&#x27;t run my fingers through my hair even 2 minutes after brushing it, but after applying this product, my hair remains untangled all day.</li>
            <li> But for thick hair to tame frizzies</li>
            <li> I like the product, but was not happy with the mess I had</li>
            <li> use to hate to wash my hair because i knew it would break and fall out the second i detangle and blow dry.</li>
            <li> I no longer have to choose between crunchy, heavily gelled curls or broken, frizzy straightened hair.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend for thin hair as it may make it oily.  </li>
            <li> So addicted to this product.</li>
            <li> then I am sad to say you won&#x27;t find anything that will.</li>
            <li> So expensive in the beauty salon!</li>
            <li> It is very expensive to purchase at the salon.</li>
            <li> I Have horrible hair from dying and heating and bleaching.</li>
            <li> Pantene Pro-V, Herbal Essences (can you say horrible RASH?), John Frieda Frizz Ease.</li>
            <li> and I still have a horrible taste in my mouth.  </li>

            <li> Makes your hair look amazing after just one use! and at 74 my hair is brittle and losing some of it but this makes it look very healthy, thanks to my Son recommending it to me...</li>
            <li> Love this product!  Happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> This is the only product that works on my Granddaughters long super curly hair ...It puts the smoothness and sheen back into her hair and people always comment on how healthy it looks. I LOVE IT AND WILL CONTINUE TO USE. Please keep this incredible pricing and fast service!!</li>
            <li> Great product, my hair is soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I love this oil and could use larger bottles. Use it everyday, sometimes multiple times a day.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping .&lt;br /&gt;An amazing product.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend (;</li>

            <li> I use this product every other day and it works wonderful. There is no stickness and it smells great with a nice shine</li>
            <li> It really makes my hair silky, soft and very manageable.  I have tried other products but this has given me the best results.</li>
            <li> I have very thick coarse (think horse mane) wavy slightly curly hair.. I also color and heat style my hair regularly and this Is  the only stuff that I have ever found to work on my hair!!! Not only does it make it look healthy and shiney it definitely keeps the frizz down,even on super hot or humid days. I am the type of girl who will spend big bucks on hair care but now that I have found this on amazon I am even more happy!!!! Trust me if you don&#x27;t like this product or it doesn&#x27;t work for you then I am sad to say you won&#x27;t find anything that will. But I don&#x27;t think you will have that problemüòä</li>
            <li> seem to work to keep the frizz down..smells good too</li>
            <li> I bought this after my hair stylist used it on my hair at my last appointment. It is wonderful! It leaves my hair soft, shiny, frizz-free, it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down, it protects against heat styling damage, AND it is non-greasy (yay!) (Also, it doesn&#x27;t have a strong fragrance to it, in case anyone is wondering. I don&#x27;t notice a smell at all.) Overall a WONDERFUL buy. I would highly recommend it, and I will DEFINITELY be purchasing this again, especially since I get such a great deal from Amazon!</li>
            <li> This oil by its a 10 is wonderful stuff..i cant belive that i just paid $24.95 for  3 oz. at a Smart Style Salon! and here it is for $4.00!! Thats over 20 bucks saved!! Amazon! you  rock!! I use all the its a 10 products and I&#x27;ll be  shopping at Amazon.com  in the future!! I love all the keratin plus products by its a 10!! They are the absolute best hair products there is!!</li>
            <li> Was recommended to me by my primary care doctor.  Works great.  Excellent price, speedy delivery.</li>
            <li> Product is fantastic!!! It controls my frizzy, wavy hair. Purchased it when I had very long hair and it worked great. Now that I have short hair, it still works. You don&#x27;t need much of the product. Great shine!!</li>
            <li> My hair needed some help surviving the heat of the desert southwest(Durango, Colorado). Works wonders, after about a week of using it every other day, my hair was feeling healthy again! Kept the split ends away and locked in moisture. Also found that it helped protect my scalp from sunburn(uv protection). Didn&#x27;t affect my hair color at all! Made my curly thick hair calm and moisturized!</li>
            <li> I started to used first in the Beauty Salon and when I came out all my friend started to tell me that my hair  was very shine. So recomend the It&#x27;s A 10  Miracle Oil Keratin.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I use it almost everyday!</li>
            <li> This stuff makes your hair smell good and soft.  I really enjoy all the It&#x27;s a 10 products.  I believe that the keratin in this product is what tames the hair</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a year and I just love it. I use it after I flat iron my hair and it makes it so soft and tames my flyaways. I have naturally wavy hair so when I straighten it tends to be not so soft, But since I have been using this product it makes my hair so soft and manageable. I would recommend this to anyone, it is for all hair types.</li>
            <li> This is one of my &amp;#34;desert island must haves&amp;#34;, along with the styling serum from this line. I have recently become interested in natural moisturizing oils and this little bottle is packed with the good stuff. It lasts a long time, you really only need a little. I use it on wet hair when I feel a little frizzy, and sometimes will scrunch this in my waves or piece out my ends with it. It really does make your hair , well, glow. They are not kidding. This is a bargain, pretty close to the wholesale price, so snap it up.</li>
            <li> I used to work in a hair salon so I&#x27;ve tried plenty of different leave in products. I have long thick hair and I use a lot of heat on my hair. This is by far my favorite because it&#x27;s light on my hair and doesn&#x27;t leave it feeling too oily. It smells great and even without blowdrying, it helps my hair dry fairly quickly and leaves my hair feeling silky smooth.</li>
            <li> I am still searching for that miracle product which will eliminate my frizz.  It is an okay product and might work for someone with not so thick and  coarse hair like mine.</li>
            <li> Its a 10 is a 10!! This oil is amazing. I receive a lot of compliments regarding my hair whenever I use its a 10!</li>
            <li> I have super coarse, frizzy, wavy hair and this is the only thing that works to tame it.  It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but totally worth it.  I use three squirts and it&#x27;s not greasy at all.  I tend to shy away from most products because I don&#x27;t like the greasy, weighed down feeling they give me.  After using this, my hair is smooth and I can run my fingers through it without getting covered in gunk.  Great stuff!</li>
            <li> This is the only product that prevents my hair from being frizzy without feeling greasy.  Other products feel greasy on my hair and doesn&#x27;t stop the frizzes so the first time I tried this I was very surprised how well it worked and I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
            <li> Love it!  I have bleached platinum hair and this, along with the It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle Deep Conditioner Plus Keratin deep conditioner and Shampoo, it stays silky smooth.</li>
            <li> First I have to say that I have severely damaged hair. Dead hair actually, after a dramatic hair salon incident. This is the only product out of the whole line that does the &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; for me. I use it on dry hair (before I use the shampoo, hair mask and leave in) and it instantly detangles and adds shine. It makes my hair look alive. However, I don&#x27;t know if it is helping to deeply restore it, probably it isn&#x27;t, since my hair is just dead.</li>
            <li> Had heard of this product from other people and wanted to try it. Look how soft and smooth my hair is with it.</li>
            <li> I just love this product and it does a fantastic job of conditioning and detangling curls!</li>
            <li> This is very concentrated, you will need just a small amount. I like it for my hair but actually LOVE it more for my skin! I have been using it on my face and neck as a night cream.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for keeping down my fly away hairs. It also makes my hair pretty soft. I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;d pay the price for this again, but it was a decent buy.</li>
            <li> Omg!! I love this oil sooo much!! Ever since I&#x27;ve been using it, my hair has been growing beautifully, but it&#x27;s not just the oil.. You have to know how to take care of your hair, but this is definitely the first step! &amp;&amp; it was even cheaper here than in the store I went too, so I&#x27;ll definitely be buying it from here more often. By the way I have natural hair that&#x27;s flat ironed and it works perfectly!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle Oil Plus Keratin works great for my hair.  I rub some on my hands and apply to my dry hair before I flat iron it and it gives it shine.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years. It is very expensive to purchase at the salon. This was a good value.</li>
            <li> Love this product so much. Works perfect for my thick hair and fly aways! Smells great too and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy like most serums.</li>
            <li> The price is right on Amazon and this product smells great and works great. I straighten my hair a lot and it helps with the fly aways and to help not make my hair look to brittle. You have to get this .</li>
            <li> Works wonders and its so inexpensive! I was so surprised because the packaging and price led me to believe it would be sub par but in fact it is excellent!</li>
            <li> Love it&#x27;s a 10 products! I purchased this smaller size to use for traveling. I didn&#x27;t realize it was the oil and not the spray (my fault for not reading the description carefully), but ended up liking the oil as well!</li>
            <li> Product works great!!!</li>
            <li> Makes my hair super soft. Too much makes your hair greasy looking - a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Does everything it supposed to do and more! Now if it would only do the dishes LOL‚Ä¶ I have fine wavy waist length hair and this softens my hair ends without leaving them greasy or heavy.</li>
            <li> This stuff is so good for frizzy hair.  I have thick dry hair.  I use a little and rub into ends and my hair just drinks it up. Makes it smooth, not oily.  I would not recommend for thin hair as it may make it oily.  But for thick hair to tame frizzies it&#x27;s perfect!</li>
            <li> I have &amp;#34;it&#x27;s 10&amp;#34; Shampoo, Conditioner and leave in. They are working great together, now my hair is shinny and straighter.</li>
            <li> Fantastic price.  Product was packaged nicely.</li>
            <li> Best product ever for dry fly away hair</li>
            <li> This really works if you are loosing hair!</li>
            <li> Exactly as expected. Will buy from agin when needed. Makes my hair soft and silky and with a non-greasy shine.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair so nice and my daughter loves it too.  It just gives the hair a nice smooth feeling.-</li>
            <li> My favorite hair oil it makes your hair shiny and soft. I gave four stars because I don&#x27;t feel that it is a \\&quot;miracle\\&quot;  oil but the very first time I used it I did notice a difference in my hair, less frizzies and fly aways. And amazon sells it for a way better price than at Target. I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Smells awesome, and really leaves the hair soft.  Only need a little bit.  The rate im going with using it everyday, it will last at least a year.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really see the difference.</li>
            <li> I thank the Ulta store in Jackson TN consultants for recommending me this hair care and &amp;#34;Its a 10&amp;#34; products. I bought the full set and very happy with it. I&#x27;ll use only this for a good long while because I like it and its related products so much. This product gave me silky, healthy-looking hair and I highly recommend it....and I&#x27;ve tried many different products from Russia, Germany, Japan, Iran, and Kazakhstan. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, after using this product, with using no straightening irons or damaging heat styling tools, my hair had more breakage and dryness than it did originally. It was reducing my natural curls and at times made my scalp itch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Freaked out and wondering what was going on with my hair, I decided to check into the ingredients of the product. I discovered that this product contains Aldehyde. To put it simply, Aldehyde is Formaldehyde with a pleasant odor. WOW - I read that the presence of Formaldehyde is common with Keratin containing products!?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I attributed the itchiness to the fact that is contains Butylphenyl methylpropional which is prone to cause dermal irritation and possible allergic reactions.</li>
            <li> My hair is natuarally very dry. This product kind of helps in making my hair look smoother and softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> Definite for blondes, restores. Awesome product that actually works. Will rebuy forever.  Makes your hair instantly manageable and soft. So happy a product finally delivers.</li>
            <li> This oil works better than any other I&#x27;ve tried. Really helps manage my thick hair and makes it very soft as well! Better to buy it on Amazon as it is cheaper (It costs over $20 at local salons). Fantastic 10 product!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a 10 line of products has changed my life . I dealt with frizz and tangles my whole life until I started to use these products, finaly no more paid as I style and brush . Thank you.</li>
            <li> My hair is currently very long (below my elbows) and fairly damaged at the bottom due to the fact that I am seriously overdue for a haircut. I usually can&#x27;t run my fingers through my hair even 2 minutes after brushing it, but after applying this product, my hair remains untangled all day. This product is a great value and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have color treated hair, some of which has been bleached for using the bright colors on.  I highly recommend this for anyone with harsh, color treated hair.  It is well worth the $25.  The bottle last about 6 months.  My hair rarely looks frazzeled and dry.</li>
            <li> So expensive in the beauty salon! Found this and was thrilled. If you have damaged hair from coloring, blow drying, using curling/flat irons..you have to try this! My hair shines and is absolutely stronger.</li>
            <li> This is one of the many It&#x27;s a 10 with Keratin products that are helping to repair the damage caused by my previous stylist over processing my hair!</li>
            <li> I have fly away hair which makes it looks somewhat frizzy.  This product helps immensely by keeping it smoother and shinier.</li>
            <li> Since I started using It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle products Plus Keratin my hair is no longer frizzy, even in humid weather.  It shines for the first time in my life. Never had anything so wonderful.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before and love it because my hair tends to be dry but this softens it up.  The product arrived as scheduled.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful!  It doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair and it&#x27;s leaves it soft and shiny.  Love the smell too!</li>
            <li> Smooths the cuticle of my hair and it looks smoother and healthier. I use a little more that recommended and it does not make my hair look oily. Just adds shine and help with the frizz! This is a great hair care line and the shampoo has no lauryl sulfate which is harsh on my hair.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product!!! I cannot say more wonderful things about it. I suggest it to everyone who has commented about the health and shine my hair has gotten using this product.</li>
            <li> I love It&#x27;s a Ten! It&#x27;s the first time I&#x27;ve tried it. I love how soft it makes my hair feel. It has repaired my hair where it has split. Good price to pay for great product.</li>
            <li> I tried this product in canada while on vacation and boy it does what it says. Smells great non greasy. Leaves hair so soft. It is really a miracle oil! Will definitely be using it!</li>
            <li> I decided to give this a try because my hairdresser used this on my hair after shampooing it.  She used it as a blow drying serum which made my hair look silky and smooth.  After several uses, I just couldn&#x27;t get over the smell when I purchased it for myself to do my hair in between the time that I went to see my hairdresser.  It smelled like a strong chemical fragrance.  I have fine hair and just didn&#x27;t like the product because it left my ends dry.</li>
            <li> Love using this when drying my hair. Helps fight the frizz big time. The keratin keeps my hair smooth and shiny without the heavy oily feel.</li>
            <li> Flawless transaction nice products.</li>
            <li> I love this product it seems to work well with my hair. The bottle is great and plus with the pump you can&#x27;t over do it.</li>
            <li> Another must have item for keratin uses. It&#x27;s not a moisturizer but it helps to take away the frizz. It works well and keeps your hair lolling moist.</li>
            <li> I use this on my extremely damaged hair and it makes it feel so soft. I highly recommend this product and this line.</li>
            <li> Great hair product for frizzy hair. Smooths it beautifully and does not make the hair feel sticky, heavy or limp.</li>
            <li> I like this product very much and feels so good in hair..</li>
            <li> My hair was damaged from chemotherapy, but after using It&#x27;s A 10 Miracle products, it is healthier than ever before.  A friend told me to try it, because my curls were frizzy.  She said it is a little expensive, but a little goes a long way.  I had tried SOOO many products, so I figured I would try one more, before accepting that my hair was permanently damaged and I would just have to accept that I had cancer, so it&#x27;s par for the course.  I bought the shampoo, conditioner, leave in conditioner, and mask, and after ONE use, I could instantly see and feel a difference!  I like the scent of the keratin shampoo, conditioner, and mask more than the leave in scent.  It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, it just doesn&#x27;t smell as wonderful as the others.  If I am in a hurry, I will just shampoo my hair, towel dry, and put some mask product in my hair, comb it through and go.  My hair is so much softer and shinier too!  It will take a MIRACLE to get me to change from these products! No pun intended :)</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. &amp;#60;3 I Have horrible hair from dying and heating and bleaching. This Miracle oil is just that, a MIRACLE!</li>
            <li> So addicted to this product. I use it on wet AND dry hair.</li>
            <li> To put in your hair after washing or later in the day to spruce it up.  This is a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I am now a fan of the It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle hair care products.  I love the keratin line of products.  My frizzy hair is now stronger, healthier, shiny and far less frizzy.  Plus my hair blow dry time has been dramatically reduced from 15 minutes to 7 minutes.</li>
            <li> I luv this product. The minute i placed it&#x27;s a 10 miracle oil plus keratin in my damaged, dry, breaking hair, it was like a miracle. My hair transformed to soft, silky, manageable, strong, sexy, beautiful hair. I will re-order forever. I highly recommend this product to anyone who want to experience a life changing transformation with their hair. It really is a 10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use to hate to wash my hair because i knew it would break and fall out the second i detangle and blow dry. Now after using it&#x27;s a 10 miracle oil plus&lt;br /&gt;keratin, i look forward to detangling comb through, and blow drying. None of my hair falls out now. I&#x27;m left with a blanket of gold silk....thanks to It&#x27;s a miracle it&#x27;s a 10 miracle oil plus keratin. I also use the it&#x27;s a 10 for blondes leave-in. It&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li> I love this product for my dry hair.  It works beautifully - I use it all the time and it definitely helps my hair to look good.</li>
            <li> This a miracle for myself and my husband&#x27;s long hair! It both detangles and softens! We love this amazing product!!</li>
            <li> Works great and does not weigh your hair down.</li>
            <li> I love it, it makes my hair smoother and shinier.</li>
            <li> Excellent seller great product</li>
            <li> Makes my hair very smooth, although you don&#x27;t need much...a little goes a long way.  So for the price, this should go a very long way:)</li>
            <li> Helps control the frizz on my hair nicely and helps it dry faster when blow drying.</li>
            <li> got this after liking the leave in conditioner - it truly is amazing. my hair is dyed blonde and it&#x27;s damaged and dried out. i use the leave in conditioner plus this miracle oil and it feels healthy and looks shiney and great ! i highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i like to use it before bed on dry hair to prevent a big crazy &#x27;blonde tubmleweed&#x27; head in the morning :)</li>
            <li> I woke up one day around 12, 13 years old with what I affectionately call \\&quot;White girl fro\\&quot; hair. You&#x27;ve all seen one; a girl with huge, fluffy, often wavy, uncontrollable hair. Somewhere during the process of puberty my hair decided it was going to turn curly. Having always had soft, thick, straight hair I could not figure out why all of the sudden my blow dryer was my worst enemy; the harder I tried to tame the beast, the larger and more ferocious it grew. One day, my best friends mother, a curly hair victim herself, added some Redken gel to my wet hair, finger combed it and put it up in a towel. She told me not to even think about touching my hair dryer. An hour went by and when I took the towel off curls cascaded down my face. My &#x27;Ah-HA!&#x27; moment; I was trying to blow dry very fine textured, thick in quantity, frizz prone curly hair straight with no tools to do the job properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since then I have tried EVERYthing under the sun. First the grocery store brands- Pantene Pro-V, Herbal Essences (can you say horrible RASH?), John Frieda Frizz Ease. Nothing worked to get my hair sleek and smooth. Then came cheaper salon brands: Bed-Head, Catwalk, Regis, Joico. All were &#x27;okay&#x27; and helped my hair to look healthier, but still not smooth and controlled. I gave up, I was a chronic victim of Ponytail headaches, trapped in a world left without style and unable to partake in fun, new hairstyles. I bought a great flat iron, a step above Chi, even. That helped some but killed the one thing my hair had going for it- healthy looking and soft. Two kids and a broken thyroid later and it was now limp, thinning and dull as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter in It&#x27;s a 10. A friend of mine who is a stylist gave me the deep treatment conditioner and shampoo, as well as the Miracle leave in. It changed my hair. I no longer have to choose between crunchy, heavily gelled curls or broken, frizzy straightened hair. I can do either and my hair, with regular trims look gorgeous and smells even MORE gorgeous either way. Nothing can repair broken hair, hair is dead but this product keeps freshly trimmed locks healthy and prevents breakage and split ends unlike any other. I&#x27;ve even used Wen because I have such dry hair but even that pales in comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My regimen includes the following; Wash with Keratin shampoo, condition with Daily Keratin conditioner. I suggest the Keratin for people who colour or straighten their hair because it will improve elasticity and prevent styling breakage. Otherwise, the normal daily products work great. I then mist with the Keratin Miracle leave in. I do this every OTHER day. Before I style, on damp or dry hair I add THREE drops of the Miracle Argon Oil to my long, mid back length hair and work in well. If I am going curly I add it to wet hair, scrunch, two more sprays leave in and up in a towel. Soft, smooth curls will await you. If there&#x27;s some frizz a little more of each the oil and spray once try will tame that. On straight days I do the same routine, letting my hair towel dry as long as possible before blow drying with my fingers (again, less breakage and frizzing) and then flat iron adding extra oil as I go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You do NOT NEED TO SHAMPOO EVERY DAY. People with &#x27;oily&#x27; hair have oily hair because they&#x27;re over washing. It will take two weeks of letting it go three days or more without using shampoo but your scalp will adjust and stop over producing oil trying to overcompensate for over washing. Shampoo every 2-3 days and on non shampoo days simply \\&quot;wash\\&quot; your hair with the Daily conditioner. Work it through your hair thoroughly, rubbing the scalp. Rinse well for five minutes in COOL water. A little leave in at the length, not the scalp and your hair will thank you. Trust me, this WILL work after a few attempts. I know it feels weird and gross the first few times but that&#x27;s your scalp adjusting to not needing to make so much extra oil. The daily conditioner is gentle and light enough to be the perfect cleansing conditioner, just like Wen but BETTER! Deep condition once a week with one of your shampoo days and in a month you will have all new hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it can save mine, it WILL save yours! My thin spots are even growing new hair again because, well...my thyroid is now under control, but also because my scalp and it&#x27;s PH and hair follicles are all healthier. It&#x27;s worth the cost and easy to afford on Amazon, plus you need so little of everything. A full order of everything is about 80.00 and that last&#x27;s me 3 months!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best product line EVER for ALL hair types!ng conditioner, just like Wen but BETTER!

            <li> I love the way it smells and my hair feels so soft after I use it. I have received a lot of compliments on my hair since switching to this.</li>
            <li> I like the product, but was not happy with the mess I had when I got it I had oil everywhere there wasn&#x27;t a lid on the bottle so the top was cracked an leaked everywhere ;(</li>
            <li> This product has such a strong dose of chemicals that it&#x27;s been an hour since I put it in my hair and I still have a horrible taste in my mouth.  I did wash my hands immediately after applying, but I still have that taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are in any way sensitive to perfumes or chemicals, I would recommend avoiding this product.</li>
            <li> I love this oil I put a ton of this oil in my hair and let it stay on for 24 hours and then I shampoo my hair and my hair is so soft. I always buy 2 or 3 so I don&#x27;t ever run out!</li>
