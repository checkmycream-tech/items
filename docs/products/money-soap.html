            <li>- The kids absolutely LOVE the beautiful fragrance of the soap (we parents like it as well!).</li>
            <li>It smelled good though.</li>
            <li>my daughter loved it will buy again</li>
            <li>and he loved it.</li>
            <li>I think i need one because its so good</li>
            <li>Good for gifts for any holiday, I&#x27;ve even put them in</li>
            <li>He loved the idea and began washing and working to get to the money.  </li>
            <li>but it is a nice product and the sellers were great about keeping me up to date on the status of the shipping.</li>
            <li>They always end up with a $1 bill, but it&#x27;s fun anyway, and the soap smells great!</li>
            <li>If there is a $1 bill then I will still be happy with my purchase as I expect nothing more than that.  </li>
            <li>Also, the soap is nice, smells good.</li>
            <li>And it smells AMAZING (for men).</li>
            <li>This soap smells AMAZING.</li>

            <li>I love this its a great gift i gave it to my brother and now he showers more to get the $</li>
            <li>Great and fun way to try to get some money!Soap Smelled</li>
            <li>Her joy subsided when she opened the bag and saw only $1, lol.</li>
            <li>The scent is quite nice, and a strong scent.</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>Telling them there COULD be more is just setting them up to resent you for lying to them.</li>
            <li>I know love them. :-)</li>
            <li>My sons always love to get this at Christmas.</li>
            <li>So, some kids may need more explanation of rules re: extracting money.</li>
            <li>Some \\&quot;batches\\&quot; seem more fragrant than others.</li>
            <li>They did ship fast, and came attractively packaged, but opening them was another story.</li>
            <li>I purchased them in hopes of the children washing their hands more often.</li>
            <li>got nothing more than a  dollar as well.</li>
            <li>They love to shower more, knowing that each shower brings them closer to getting \\&quot;filthy\\&quot; rich!</li>
            <li>He was given some for Christmas and he loved the soap so much he put in a request to have some for his birthday too  </li>
            <li>The soaps look good and my kids are excited to see how much money is inside</li>
            <li>thats just fine.</li>
            <li>Very fun memory.  </li>
            <li>Because the idea is fun!</li>
            <li>and they were totally excited about them.</li>
            <li>I would order it again--great fun for kids!</li>
            <li>the rest used it said it had a clean scent...</li>
            <li>Kids loved the opportunity to get up to $20 in their soap, although they both only got $1.00 apiece, it was still exciting!</li>
            <li>All loved the gift but each only got $1 out of the bars.</li>
            <li>Yes, it&#x27;s cool to have money in your soap when your a kid.</li>
            <li>The soap has a very powerful powdery smell but the kids had fun using it to get to the money.</li>
            <li>thought this would be a fun way for my kids to get clean.  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve never fiund more than a $5 bill in the soap, but the anticipation of finding out how much you get is always part of the fun.</li>
            <li>If you do, it will probably be a $5, or a $10 if you&#x27;re really lucky.  </li>
            <li>I know he got lucky this year</li>
            <li>The smell of the soap is very strong - kind of fruity and floral - which is a little cloying.</li>
            <li>Smell is great-- a little chemically, but it smells clean, plus the money is fun.</li>
            <li>Given that, it is VERY OVERPRICED and MORE than covers the rare occasion when any higher bill is inside the soap.</li>
            <li>Not that I expected the world&#x27;s best soap product, but it would have been nice if it actually held together through several uses.</li>
            <li>Would not buy again, even as a fun or *joke* gift.</li>
            <li>but it was fun</li>
            <li>but it was so fun for him</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll make my own next time.</li>
            <li>I HAVE BOUGHT $10.00 WORTH</li>
            <li>This was a fun soap.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s fun and is worth the price.  </li>
            <li>Everyone had fun with the soap and there were a few that had more than just a dollar!!</li>
            <li>All in all, this soap DOES what it says it does, \\&quot;gets kids to wash more\\&quot; and really, isnt that worth every dime it costs!?</li>
            <li>As long as they love to use it in the shower, I will continue to purchase it for them!</li>
            <li>She loved the idea of money being hidden within the soap.</li>
            <li>Then the oldest one snuck off and cut open all but one to get the money out the quick and easy way.</li>
            <li>I paid $15 for a bar of soap that fell apart during the first wash.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait until he gets to the (most likely $1 bill) money.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll update when we get to the money for how much we got!</li>
            <li>I actually really really like the smell!</li>
            <li>Altho, in the catalogs the soaps are said to have denominations of up to $50, we&#x27;ve not seen many above $1.00.</li>
            <li>Would absolutely recommend to friends/family, will be buying again for my home as well!</li>
            <li>She kind of expected it though.</li>
            <li>It smells great too and last a long time!</li>
            <li>The idea is fun and clever, but we, of course, only received $1.00, as most people probably do.</li>
            <li>and I thought she might be a bit old for it, but she seemed real interested in planning a shower that evening.  </li>
            <li>The one that was used correctly did inspire a lot of extra hand washing (always a good thing, especially in the winter) and speculation about what might be inside.</li>
            <li>&quot;, this soap does that &amp; more, THAT is what matters to ME in long run.</li>
            <li>Even as an adult I thought that this was a cool idea and would like to receive one.</li>
            <li>But my daughter, being a teenager, genuinely wanted to use the soap and work her way toward the cash in the middle.</li>
            <li>what a bummer&amp;#34; Since it was his birthday, of course he expected more than a dollar</li>
            <li>Got here fast</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t mind heavily scented soaps, you will enjoy this and think it is a fun gift!</li>
            <li>Cute idea, not worth the money.</li>
            <li>grandson was thrilled to death with such a novel gift, but as a 12 year old would say,.......&amp;#34;Geeze I only got a dollar.</li>
            <li>But in the end, it is a complete rip-off and you would be better to make your own soap with money in it for less than a dollar for each bar.</li>
            <li>I was a bit worried because my husband has sensitive skin and only can use certain soaps but this on did not break him out!</li>
            <li>The only negative is that the soap has a super strong fragrance to it.</li>
            <li>unfortunately, the recipient of the gift used it up so quickly that it really didnt acheive its purpose of him getting clean</li>
            <li>The  little 8 year old girl who received this soap for Christmas was sooooo excited.  </li>
            <li>The kids now ask to shower WAY more than usual!</li>
            <li>In the very first use the soap cracked in half and revealed the dollar inside.</li>
            <li>Quite a few people complain that its only a dollar inside or that the smell is strong.</li>
            <li>It certainly had the desired comedic effect, and everyone thought the item was cute and silly.</li>
            <li>Fun none the less</li>
            <li>give the money soap to grandsons for xmas, it was a big hit, they can&#x27;t wait to use up soap to see how much money is inside the grandson in college can&#x27;t wait to get back to school to show his friends</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care if it&#x27;s a ten dollar waste of money, it&#x27;s still fun!</li>
            <li>I was nervous with all of the kids getting to the middle together as I didn&#x27;t want anyone to feel left out if they didn&#x27;t get as much as the next kid, but that didn&#x27;t seem to be a problem.</li>
            <li>The fun of the money is a small part of his liking it.</li>

            <li> The fun of the money is a small part of his liking it.</li>
            <li> Have bought several of these and will continue to buy as long as kids</li>
            <li> and my Daughter has been asking for this for such a long time.  </li>
            <li> If you get this for your kids, tell them there&#x27;s a single dollar bill inside.  </li>
            <li> Also money was wet.</li>
            <li> but it is what I expected.</li>
            <li> My son gets this in his stocking every year, but he&#x27;s never been patient enough to use it until the money comes out - he usually digs it out within a week or so.</li>
            <li> If you were to do the math on this you would find that at least 1 of the bars that I purchased would have had a larger amount than $1 inside.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not purchased these soaps thru Amazon, I found mine in a few catalogs that came my way &amp; decided to check them out.</li>
            <li> In addition, the soap is only &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34; -- not a particularly interesting scent, not a particularly interesting feel, not particularly interesting PERIOD!</li>
            <li> A little small</li>
            <li> We got this a little late in the mail</li>
            <li> \\&quot;1st time Mommy baskets\\&quot; I made up for a few friends!</li>
            <li> i found it a funny and hysterical gift for the teen who refuses to shower!</li>
            <li> THAT SUCKS FOR ME.</li>

            <li> I got my granddaughter a bunch of &#x27;junk&#x27; as stocking stuffers but this was the jackpot.  I was a little wary about buying it since she&#x27;s 13 and I thought she might be a bit old for it, but she seemed real interested in planning a shower that evening.  Score for Grandma!</li>
            <li> The scent is quite nice, and a strong scent. The money inside is a definate plus.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen this product in catalogs for several years and always gotten a chuckle out of it. Finally, this year I purchased it as a tongue-in-cheek stocking stuffer for my teenage daughter. It certainly had the desired comedic effect, and everyone thought the item was cute and silly. But my daughter, being a teenager, genuinely wanted to use the soap and work her way toward the cash in the middle. That was where things went wrong. In the very first use the soap cracked in half and revealed the dollar inside. Not that I expected the world&#x27;s best soap product, but it would have been nice if it actually held together through several uses.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing! The idea is fun and clever, but we, of course, only received $1.00, as most people probably do. Given that, it is VERY OVERPRICED and MORE than covers the rare occasion when any higher bill is inside the soap. In addition, the soap is only &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34; -- not a particularly interesting scent, not a particularly interesting feel, not particularly interesting PERIOD! Would not buy again, even as a fun or *joke* gift. Too bad. Because the idea is fun!</li>
            <li> My son gets this in his stocking every year, but he&#x27;s never been patient enough to use it until the money comes out - he usually digs it out within a week or so. We&#x27;ve never fiund more than a $5 bill in the soap, but the anticipation of finding out how much you get is always part of the fun. The smell of the soap is very strong - kind of fruity and floral - which is a little cloying.</li>
            <li> Kids loved the opportunity to get up to $20 in their soap, although they both only got $1.00 apiece, it was still exciting!</li>
            <li> We have not quite made it to the money in the middle yet!  My son liked this as a gift.  The only negative is that the soap has a super strong fragrance to it. If you don&#x27;t mind heavily scented soaps, you will enjoy this and think it is a fun gift!</li>
            <li> how has nobody thought of just breaking the soap to get the money?</li>
            <li> Cute idea, not worth the money. I paid $15 for a bar of soap that fell apart during the first wash. It smelled good though.</li>
            <li> I thought the soap smelt great it took bout one week to get money out we used the soap alot had a dollar in it my daughter loved it will buy again</li>
            <li> Great and fun way to try to get some money!Soap Smelled SO GOOD!!!Mine had a $1 in it,but i aint complaining you just gotta hope you get lucky!!Definetely will buy again!!</li>
            <li> only got a $1 but it was fun</li>
            <li> I love this. I don&#x27;t care if it&#x27;s a ten dollar waste of money, it&#x27;s still fun! And it smells AMAZING (for men). I can&#x27;t wait until he gets to the (most likely $1 bill) money. Plus, it&#x27;ll be an extra incentive for the man to wash his...you know...better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update when we get to the money for how much we got! PS...it&#x27;s not just the bill in the soap in case you&#x27;re worried about ruining it- it&#x27;s wrapped in some sort of plastic shield.</li>
            <li> The soap has a very powerful powdery smell but the kids had fun using it to get to the money.</li>
            <li> Awesome and fun great stocking stuffer or mini gift!</li>
            <li> I have a friend that once worked where they made these.  They told me that they only put larger bills in about 1-3% of the bars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: Don&#x27;t ever expect to get anything over $1.  If you do, it will probably be a $5, or a $10 if you&#x27;re really lucky.  $20 and $50 are practically nonexistent.  If you get this for your kids, tell them there&#x27;s a single dollar bill inside.  Telling them there COULD be more is just setting them up to resent you for lying to them.</li>
            <li> This is great. My son was showering 2x a day to get the $.  He only got $1 but it was a big hit.  He was yelling updates on how close he was to the $ while showering.</li>
            <li> Bought it for a gift. Quite a few people complain that its only a dollar inside or that the smell is strong. I actually really really like the smell!</li>
            <li> Has a great fragrance. Got 3 of these and gave them as Christmas stocking stuffers. All loved the gift but each only got $1 out of the bars.</li>
            <li> grandson was thrilled to death with such a novel gift, but as a 12 year old would say,.......&amp;#34;Geeze I only got a dollar. what a bummer&amp;#34; Since it was his birthday, of course he expected more than a dollar</li>
            <li> This soap smells AMAZING. It also encourages kids to wash/bath so they can get to the money. Have bought several of these and will continue to buy as long as kids I know love them. :-)</li>
            <li> Bought this for my son as a stocking stuffer. He only got $1 but it was so fun for him and he loved it. Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> My sons always love to get this at Christmas. They always end up with a $1 bill, but it&#x27;s fun anyway, and the soap smells great!</li>
            <li> I love this its a great gift i gave it to my brother and now he showers more to get the $ I think i need one because its so good</li>
            <li> I got these for my nieces/nephews for Christmas and they were totally excited about them. Then the oldest one snuck off and cut open all but one to get the money out the quick and easy way. So disappointing! So, some kids may need more explanation of rules re: extracting money. The one that was used correctly did inspire a lot of extra hand washing (always a good thing, especially in the winter) and speculation about what might be inside.</li>
            <li> thought this would be a fun way for my kids to get clean.  The soaps look good and my kids are excited to see how much money is inside</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not purchased these soaps thru Amazon, I found mine in a few catalogs that came my way &amp; decided to check them out. Altho, in the catalogs the soaps are said to have denominations of up to $50, we&#x27;ve not seen many above $1.00. Some \\&quot;batches\\&quot; seem more fragrant than others. We&#x27;ve never had any adverse reactions to this soap. My son gets a kick out of the \\&quot;anticipation\\&quot; as I do with the novelty of the soap/money idea. All in all, this soap DOES what it says it does, \\&quot;gets kids to wash more\\&quot; and really, isnt that worth every dime it costs!? These days you don&#x27;t find alot of products that \\&quot;follow thru\\&quot;, this soap does that &amp; more, THAT is what matters to ME in long run. Would absolutely recommend to friends/family, will be buying again for my home as well! Great stocking stuffers!!! Good for gifts for any holiday, I&#x27;ve even put them in \\&quot;1st time Mommy baskets\\&quot; I made up for a few friends!</li>
            <li> bought 2 soaps at $15 a peice and only wound up with a dollar in each one.  it did give a pay out but still it was a $28 loss.</li>
            <li> The money was out within one wash for each of my kids.  Oh well.  I&#x27;ll make my own next time. Also money was wet.</li>
            <li> I GOT GYPED. I HAVE BOUGHT $10.00 WORTH A MONEY SOAP AND ALL I GOT BACK WAS A ONE DOLLAR BILL. THAT SUCKS FOR ME.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my son for his birthday.  He was given some for Christmas and he loved the soap so much he put in a request to have some for his birthday too  The fun of the money is a small part of his liking it.</li>
            <li> The  little 8 year old girl who received this soap for Christmas was sooooo excited.  She could not believe there was going to be &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; money inside of the soap.  And it smelled delicious, too!</li>
            <li> Cons - The soap is pricey. The majority of soaps only have one dollar inside of them. They don&#x27;t last long.&lt;br /&gt;Pros - The kids absolutely LOVE the beautiful fragrance of the soap (we parents like it as well!). The kids now ask to shower WAY more than usual! LoL  They love to shower more, knowing that each shower brings them closer to getting \\&quot;filthy\\&quot; rich! As long as they love to use it in the shower, I will continue to purchase it for them!</li>
            <li> Great stocking stuffers.  Everyone had fun with the soap and there were a few that had more than just a dollar!!</li>
            <li> Bought these as Christmas gifts for my nephews.  One actually broke it open with out washing...greedy thing.  the rest used it said it had a clean scent...but all they each got was only $1.00.  Fun none the less</li>
            <li> I ordered 6 of these money soaps for a stocking stuffer for my children and my nieces and nephews for Christmas. They did ship fast, and came attractively packaged, but opening them was another story. I purchased them in hopes of the children washing their hands more often. This was a fail as my brother and husband immediately got out a kitchen knife and cut them in half to get to the money. I was nervous with all of the kids getting to the middle together as I didn&#x27;t want anyone to feel left out if they didn&#x27;t get as much as the next kid, but that didn&#x27;t seem to be a problem. All were encasing a $1 bill which made me feel ripped off. Under the sellers information it states there there is a different donation in each bar. If you were to do the math on this you would find that at least 1 of the bars that I purchased would have had a larger amount than $1 inside. This leads me to believe that there is only $1 bills in these bars of soap and then the price gets jacked up to make a profit of over $9. Yes, it&#x27;s cool to have money in your soap when your a kid. Even as an adult I thought that this was a cool idea and would like to receive one. But in the end, it is a complete rip-off and you would be better to make your own soap with money in it for less than a dollar for each bar.</li>
            <li> unfortunately, the recipient of the gift used it up so quickly that it really didnt acheive its purpose of him getting clean LOL. and he only got a dollar, but thats just fine. i found it a funny and hysterical gift for the teen who refuses to shower! LOL</li>
            <li> give the money soap to grandsons for xmas, it was a big hit, they can&#x27;t wait to use up soap to see how much money is inside the grandson in college can&#x27;t wait to get back to school to show his friends, everyone wanted to know where i bought it so they can order some for next years gifts.</li>
            <li> This was a fun soap. Took a while to get the money out and I believe it was a $2 bill. I was a bit worried because my husband has sensitive skin and only can use certain soaps but this on did not break him out! I bought it as a stocking stuffer for X-mas. It smells great too and last a long time!</li>
            <li> This purchase was for my daughter. She loved the idea of money being hidden within the soap. Her joy subsided when she opened the bag and saw only $1, lol. She kind of expected it though. She&#x27;d watched Money Soap videos on You Tube and the kids in the video got nothing more than a  dollar as well.</li>
            <li> I got this for my 8 year son as a stocking stuffer this year.  He loved the idea and began washing and working to get to the money.  Well, he got a $50 bill!!!!  I can&#x27;t believe it.  He was so HAPPY, it was like he won the lottery.  Very fun memory.  I know he got lucky this year but I would buy the soap again next Christmas or for birthdays.  Also, the soap is nice, smells good. etc.</li>
            <li> Got here fast and my Daughter has been asking for this for such a long time.  So happy I found it.</li>
            <li> Smell is great-- a little chemically, but it smells clean, plus the money is fun.</li>
            <li> A little small but it is what I expected. Fast shipping. Thank you. Hopefully big money is in there</li>
            <li> We got this a little late in the mail but it is a nice product and the sellers were great about keeping me up to date on the status of the shipping. I think it&#x27;s fun and is worth the price.  I don&#x27;t expect my daughter to get a $100 bill inside but if she does I will be pleasantly shocked.  If there is a $1 bill then I will still be happy with my purchase as I expect nothing more than that.  I would order it again--great fun for kids!</li>
