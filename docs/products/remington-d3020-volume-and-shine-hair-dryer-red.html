    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>/&gt;Great blow dryer, great deal!</li>
            <li>It was perfect for my hair</li>
            <li>/&gt;Very, very happy with this feature.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t that impressed with them.</li>
            <li>But as a hair dryer it worked excellent for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This dryer works perfectly.</li>
            <li>Performace-wise it was a great hairdryer.</li>
            <li>Great results on medium heat.</li>
            <li>This hair dryer is great for the price.  </li>
            <li>This is a great hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to report that this dryer does both of those things well.  </li>
            <li>That may be a safety mechanism, but it doesn&#x27;t make me happy.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Every person who used the dryer had good things to say about how efficient it was at drying hair, not drying out hair, or frizzing it</li>
            <li>it is a good choice.</li>
            <li>Good variable speeds</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>This Remington brand hair dryer replaces a Conair I owned and thought I loved.  </li>
            <li>At this price point, this hair dryer is a good buy.  </li>
            <li>My wife &amp; daughter also say it works great for all their more rigorous styling needs.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;re very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>The weight is just right and the construction and quality is excellent.</li>
            <li>This fits the bill, plus it&#x27;s attractive and looks nice on my counter top.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was impressed by my first trial.</li>
            <li>it is pleasant and my hair looks better after a shower</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am very happy with this hairdryer, however, and with its gentle and cooling drying power.</li>
            <li>Sometimes you need that kind of versatility.  </li>
            <li>The diffuser is also a handy gadget for those days you want to go curly.  </li>
            <li>I have come to Love this hair dryer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many hair dryers over the years, from high-end to drugstore brands.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;And if I may address the \\&quot;ionic generator creates 90% more conditioning ions, leaving you frizz-free\\&quot; nonsense.... come on.  </li>
            <li>The bright red color stands out and my wife is happy with the color.  </li>
            <li>The best surprise was the next morning when I got up</li>
            <li>I was able to be out the door in mins without ever even warming up my straightening iron and without the dreaded mommy ponytail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I find it OK and would probably choose it if I had a choice.</li>
            <li>However I think the price more than makes up for its short-comings.</li>
            <li>so it gets an OK rating from me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, after many years I took a leap of faith picked this Remington hair dryer from vine.</li>
            <li>I had too many stray flyways after I used them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I gave it a try.</li>
            <li>The color is not my favorite, but what matters is it works.</li>
            <li>The weight is perfect, as some of these pistol type dryers can be quite heavy, and are a problem when doing one&#x27;s own hair.  </li>
            <li>But the reason it&#x27;s so light is it&#x27;s very cheaply made.  </li>
            <li>Remington D3020 Volume and Shine Hair Dryer is a fantastic change for the better, for me.</li>
            <li>the plus side, it is very lightweight, so might be a good choice for someone with impaired arm strength.  </li>
            <li>I rarely need a hair dryer, but when I do its nice to have one that works well.</li>
            <li>It snaps on easily and doesn&#x27;t fall off.</li>
            <li>The attachments work easily and do their job, but I wasn&#x27;t blown away by anything about the Remington Volume and Shine Hair Dryer beyond the price.</li>
            <li>many hair dryers, this one has 1875 watts  with 3 heat settings, 2 speed settings and a cool shot button.  </li>
            <li>Then I&#x27;d wake up with bed head, do my best to smash it down and toss in a ponytail.</li>
            <li>and it is still working fine.</li>
            <li>G Remington D3020 Volume and Shine Hair Dryer]] is fine, but there is no noticeable benefit from its \\&quot;ionic ceramic technology\\</li>
            <li>She finds the blower and temperature settings more than adequate for her hair drying/styling requirements.</li>
            <li>has three settings, from cool to warm to hot that are easily adjustable while drying your hair.  </li>
            <li>Everything you need for a little bit of money---what more can you ask for today!!!!!</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Remington D3020 hair dryer will be available to my overnight guests.</li>
            <li>and it was STILL perfectly smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>but it kind of does what it is designed to do in a rather straight forward manner.</li>
            <li>This is a great looking Red</li>
            <li>There are two attachments to smooth or wave your hair</li>
            <li>So this dryer fit what I was looking for.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Lightweight and portable, and easily fit into my suitcase for traveling.</li>
            <li>Add to that the great attachments, and the reasonable price, and I would absolutely choose this hair dryer, along with its plethora of ions, all over again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to cool off.  </li>
            <li>In addition, it doesn&#x27;t get very hot or blow that strongly.  </li>
            <li>It was shiny and smooth, more smooth than when I use my straight iron</li>
            <li>It would seem to be a good fit for youngsters just learning how to manage their own hair, and for older people who have lost some upper body strength over the years.</li>
            <li>While the dryer is larger than some my wife has owned it is quite light which is good because she has problems with her grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have to admit that I&#x27;ve had pretty good luck with hair dryers over all, most last over a decade</li>
            <li>if you are this is the dryer for you, it&#x27;s BRIGHT red).</li>
            <li>bright red hair dryer boasts plenty of power and 3 separate temperature and fan settings.  </li>
            <li>1875 Watt Tourmaline Ceramic 2-in-1 Styler, Cord Reel Dryer]]which also has 1875 watts with 3 heat settings, 2 speed settings and a cool shot button.</li>
            <li>Overall, good hair dryer that runs hotter than others we have had.  </li>
            <li>There is a cool setting which she likes.</li>
            <li>think its a good dryer, I have only used it for a couple of weeks, and do not&lt;br /&gt;notice</li>
            <li>so I know that Samy Big Curls is doing a good job here.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is ideal, as anyone knows that blasting hot air at your hair is extremely damaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>model has most of the required standards of a hair dryer such as 3 heat settings and a 2 speed setting; the motor is 1875 watts along with a cool shot feature that will hold your look in place; there is a removable filter, diffuser, and concentrator and a ionic generator that creates 90% more condition ions which is to leave your hair frizz-free.</li>
            <li>I often hold it by the barrel when straightening my hair which is fine because that part does not get too hot.  </li>
            <li>This particular hair dryer would be better used on someone with shorter, thinner hair.</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t have any special success with those either.  </li>
            <li>Good attachments, lightweight, not really loud, removable filter.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with it, and the red color just makes it fun.</li>
            <li>The attachments were a pleasant surprise, as I would not have expected to find both a concentrator and diffuser at this price.  </li>
            <li>longer snoot seems to focus the stream of hot air better, our hair dries faster and the new Remington is significantly quieter.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light, which is great if you have really long hair, but the extreme lightness and plastic casing contribute to that cheap feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a lot of fun using the diffuser attachment too for a thicker look.</li>
            <li>The attachments included are handy to have, especially the air director.</li>
            <li>gave it 4 star, as it is a good regular everyday Hair Dryer with a good price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t get too hot, has 3 temps and 2 speeds and a cool blast if you need it.</li>
            <li>Luckily for me, using the attachments for the first time in my life, I did not have that happen.  </li>
            <li>The first level, runs cool while the second two are warm and hot.</li>
            <li>Snaps right on and off.  </li>
            <li>She says the new unit is light-weight, easy to use, and versatile.</li>
            <li>The attachments were all useful and quite easy to place on the machine and remove...another plus as far as she is concerned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Yes it is powerful, but when it gets hot it shuts off.  </li>
            <li>(She didn&#x27;t express an opinion about the \\&quot;cool shot\\&quot; feature saying she didn&#x27;t use it much as she didn&#x27;t see the need.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really say for sure that my hair has more shine or is any smoother after using it instead of any other hair dryer despite the advertising claims.  </li>
            <li>Although it has the same wattage, it seems more powerful.</li>
            <li>It is not particularly small or light weight and reminds me of hair dryers I used years ago.</li>
            <li>The alternative would be a good 30mins with the straight iron trying to get it to smooth out and lay flat enough to resemble some sort of style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this unit since Feb 2015, after striking out with a different brands cord-keeper model.  </li>
            <li>I feel that the seller willingly sold me a defective item.</li>
            <li>It has plenty of power, plenty of heat, and attachments that rival the higher priced hair dryers.  </li>
            <li>and it works as well as it did when I first purchased</li>
            <li>Hot Rod of Hair Dryers.&#x27;</li>
            <li>If you want a dryer to boost volume and add some shine, there is not reason to spend 50 dollars or more when you can spend 20 max on this product and have the same results.</li>
            <li>The plug has a reset button and I had to use it the first time I even tried the dryer.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;There are two control switches, the first is the on/off and high/low switch.</li>
            <li>The Second is the temperature control switch with three levels and this is the aspect I love.</li>
            <li>The various settings (3) are a nice feature and so far it has shown to deserve five stars.</li>
            <li>Therefore I really enjoy that I have the option to run on a cool cycle throughout my blow dry.</li>
            <li>My wife comments that she forgot to use conditioner this morning, but her hair came out silky smooth because of the ionic generator.&lt;br /&gt;And, of course, a red hair dryer looks pretty hot on the bathroom sink.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been able to dry it in under 4 minutes.</li>
            <li>the most they would do is dry my hair before bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Then I bought a Conair Infiniti which I also returned because even on low the intensity was so strong my shoulder length hair kept getting all snarled and knotted.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Based on this, the unit certainly deserves a five-star rating.</li>
            <li>G Remington D3020 Volume and Shine Hair Dryer]] is a powerful hair dryer that is a lot better than previous hair dryers we have had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is very light weight but not very portable.  </li>
            <li>recently read, in fact, that you should be treating your hair as if it were a fine cashmere sweater.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If it lasts at least 5 years like the old one, we will be happy.</li>
            <li>However, there is one huge standout feature on this Remington model that I especially like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found 2 ways that work very well with it.</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally straight (with some wave when it&#x27;s shorter).</li>
            <li>It does this very well.</li>
            <li>I really thought that was going to be just a gimmick.</li>
            <li>Longevity-wise, not so much.</li>
            <li>Two attachments are included: a diffuser for waves and curls as well s a concentrator for straight hair.</li>
            <li>My wife really likes this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>of all, this hair dryer adds volume and is offered at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>, really didn&#x27;t change this process at all...</li>
            <li>My daughter and granddaughter both have used this Hair Dryer and have found it to be very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I dont really understand this generator product but the device works well</li>
            <li>It feels very lightweight and you get some heat/cool settings to play with.</li>
            <li>much movement drying as my Revlon dryer does.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I gave it a shot without really being motivated.</li>
            <li>But the concentrator nozzle on the Conair was almost too much</li>
            <li>I also used the concentrator attachment for straight hair and it looked like</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not a heavy dryer, more lite weight, but using a smaller dryer, is lighter then this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is a pretty standard hair dryer with two speeds and three heat settings plus a \\&quot;cool shot to set style in place.\\</li>
            <li>The red color is pretty cool, too.</li>
            <li>less than 2 and a half years is very good usage value.</li>
            <li>&quot; that provides \\&quot;90% more ions for extreme volume &amp; shine.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>With this one I&#x27;m able to make my hair dry straight instead of making me look like an old school rabbi.</li>
            <li>It makes a huge difference in the look of my spiky short new pixie cut.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It also seems to make my hair fuller on top where it has thinned slightly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that when I plugged this unit into my main bathroom counters outlet, it would trip the circuit breaker.</li>
            <li>This particular dryer is nothing special.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use this only for quick scalp drying</li>
            <li>For the money it&#x27;s a pretty good buy, but not ideal for everyone.</li>
            <li>The Remington D3020 Volume and Shine Hair Dryer comes highly recommended.</li>
            <li>highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>First dryer had a really good review online, yet was a total failure in reality.</li>
            <li>If I want a style with a little more oomph though, this product does the trick.</li>
            <li>My first impression was that it looked and felt a little cheap.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used it I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, it&#x27;s a bit heavier than my last</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has more power than one we bought a few years ago (Vidal Sassoon \\&quot;Ionizer\\&quot; VS785).</li>
            <li>/&gt;Having a brand new hairdryer to use after I washed it was eye opening for me.  </li>
            <li>I needed a new dryer.</li>
            <li>and I have a more heavy duty dryer for when I need to completely blow-dry all my hair.</li>
            <li>After that I have given it few more trials so far I am seeing the same result as the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was set to not like this one because the other one was more my style visually.</li>
            <li>Hot Red FireEngineRed.</li>
            <li>(Do be careful of the high heat setting as it is indeed hot!)</li>
            <li>only thing I cannot figure out is, how to clean out the lint that cumulates in the back of a hair</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice it at first because I stand close to the outlet, but when I went to dry my daughter&#x27;s hair, it didn&#x27;t reach where she normally stands.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve certainly heard noisier hair dryers though this is far from silent.  </li>
            <li>For the most basic of needs it works quite well, but be prepared to spend a little while under the dryer.</li>
            <li>I was suprised to find how soft my hair felt after using it.</li>
            <li>No gimmicks like \\&quot;ion\\&quot; or anything, just a solid hair dryer at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This means that vigorous towel drying is NOT recommended; only gentle drying in every way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Remington, on all speeds and settings, respects the manner in which hair should be dried.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use that attachment 90% of the time when finalizing a style, and want to lock it in place without completely re-arranging it.</li>
            <li>My wife and I have adopted the Remington D3020 Volume &amp; Shine Hair Dryer as our preferred hair dryer, relegating our old Brand X dryer to the guest</li>
            <li>it is also extremely loud.  </li>
            <li>My hair is nearly waist-length and quite wavy</li>
            <li>I bought this hair dryer to replace an old ConAir dryer that wasn&#x27;t putting out sufficient air.</li>
            <li>have medium  thick colored weave in my hair ,kind of short hair, and did not find this hair dryer gave my hair</li>
            <li>But so far so good, and it&#x27;s seen heavy use for a few weeks.</li>
            <li>I normally use the concentrator attachment to dry my hair straight.</li>
            <li>This is great for me as I typically hate using my hairdryer when is it hot out, or I still need to cool down after a workout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For me, I want one that genuinely gets HOT as I have very coarse, thick hair.  </li>
            <li>First I had purchased the Revlon Matte Chrome Full-Size Turbo Hair Dryer - RV473V1 on Amazon, but sent it back as it only got lukewarm.</li>
            <li>But now my hair has completely changed from fine straight &amp; light to curly, course and dark which my last dryer seemed to make worse.</li>
            <li>But it does dry your hair relatively quickly at a reasonable cost</li>
            <li>short in a traditional parted cut, it hasn&#x27;t been really necessary.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>This hairdryer has multiple heat settings and multiple airflow settings, which I found unusual for a product in this price range.  </li>
            <li>In addition, its fairly quiet (as hair dryers go) and easy to manage because its not too heavy.&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a concentrator, which is almost a must, and it is vented a little on the sides to keep from sizzling your hair off, or sizzling the hair dryer, or starting an electrical fire when you forget what you are doing and hold it too close to your hair.  </li>
            <li>so it didn&#x27;t fit in the small drawer, but that isn&#x27;t a big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s reasonably priced, seems to be well made &amp; should stand up to the rigors of daily use by 3 people for a long time.</li>
            <li>anything different in drying my hair then using my old dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this new hair dryer along with a couple of Samy Big Curls products and my hair came back to life.&lt;br /&gt;I am still using my &amp;#34;old&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I shave my head, but I live in a house of folks with long hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is a little bigger than her old one (also a Remington which stopped working right recently after 5 years of use)</li>
            <li>My hair has a tendency to be on the frizzy side whether I use a hair dryer or not so when I used this, I expected much the same.  </li>
            <li>Our daughter started using this dryer and completely switched over from her much more expensive unit from another manufacturer.</li>
            <li>dont agree with some other reviewers that find the red color too much to bear.</li>
            <li>normally I&#x27;d just go to bed with wet hair or let it airdry before bed.</li>
            <li>With the old Vidal Sassoon it took about 10 minutes (long hair), but with the Remington it only takes about five, even though both have the same wattage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had also recently junked two ConAir flat irons because they quit working, so I wanted to divorce ConAir altogether when  it became apparent</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line: If you have thin, fine hair this might be what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> /&gt;Great blow dryer, great deal!</li>
            <li> It was perfect for my hair</li>
            <li> /&gt;Very, very happy with this feature.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t that impressed with them.</li>
            <li> But as a hair dryer it worked excellent for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This dryer works perfectly.</li>
            <li> Performace-wise it was a great hairdryer.</li>
            <li> Great results on medium heat.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is great for the price.  </li>
            <li> This is a great hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy to report that this dryer does both of those things well.  </li>
            <li> That may be a safety mechanism, but it doesn&#x27;t make me happy.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Every person who used the dryer had good things to say about how efficient it was at drying hair, not drying out hair, or frizzing it</li>
            <li> it is a good choice.</li>
            <li> Good variable speeds</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> This Remington brand hair dryer replaces a Conair I owned and thought I loved.  </li>
            <li> At this price point, this hair dryer is a good buy.  </li>
            <li> My wife &amp; daughter also say it works great for all their more rigorous styling needs.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> The weight is just right and the construction and quality is excellent.</li>
            <li> This fits the bill, plus it&#x27;s attractive and looks nice on my counter top.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was impressed by my first trial.</li>
            <li> it is pleasant and my hair looks better after a shower</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am very happy with this hairdryer, however, and with its gentle and cooling drying power.</li>
            <li> Sometimes you need that kind of versatility.  </li>
            <li> The diffuser is also a handy gadget for those days you want to go curly.  </li>
            <li> I have come to Love this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many hair dryers over the years, from high-end to drugstore brands.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;And if I may address the \\&quot;ionic generator creates 90% more conditioning ions, leaving you frizz-free\\&quot; nonsense.... come on.  </li>
            <li> The bright red color stands out and my wife is happy with the color.  </li>
            <li> The best surprise was the next morning when I got up</li>
            <li> I was able to be out the door in mins without ever even warming up my straightening iron and without the dreaded mommy ponytail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I find it OK and would probably choose it if I had a choice.</li>
            <li> However I think the price more than makes up for its short-comings.</li>
            <li> so it gets an OK rating from me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, after many years I took a leap of faith picked this Remington hair dryer from vine.</li>
            <li> I had too many stray flyways after I used them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I gave it a try.</li>
            <li> The color is not my favorite, but what matters is it works.</li>
            <li> The weight is perfect, as some of these pistol type dryers can be quite heavy, and are a problem when doing one&#x27;s own hair.  </li>
            <li> But the reason it&#x27;s so light is it&#x27;s very cheaply made.  </li>
            <li> Remington D3020 Volume and Shine Hair Dryer is a fantastic change for the better, for me.</li>
            <li> the plus side, it is very lightweight, so might be a good choice for someone with impaired arm strength.  </li>
            <li> I rarely need a hair dryer, but when I do its nice to have one that works well.</li>
            <li> It snaps on easily and doesn&#x27;t fall off.</li>
            <li> The attachments work easily and do their job, but I wasn&#x27;t blown away by anything about the Remington Volume and Shine Hair Dryer beyond the price.</li>
            <li> many hair dryers, this one has 1875 watts  with 3 heat settings, 2 speed settings and a cool shot button.  </li>
            <li> Then I&#x27;d wake up with bed head, do my best to smash it down and toss in a ponytail.</li>
            <li> and it is still working fine.</li>
            <li> G Remington D3020 Volume and Shine Hair Dryer]] is fine, but there is no noticeable benefit from its \\&quot;ionic ceramic technology\\</li>
            <li> She finds the blower and temperature settings more than adequate for her hair drying/styling requirements.</li>
            <li> has three settings, from cool to warm to hot that are easily adjustable while drying your hair.  </li>
            <li> Everything you need for a little bit of money---what more can you ask for today!!!!!</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Remington D3020 hair dryer will be available to my overnight guests.</li>
            <li> and it was STILL perfectly smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> but it kind of does what it is designed to do in a rather straight forward manner.</li>
            <li> This is a great looking Red</li>
            <li> There are two attachments to smooth or wave your hair</li>
            <li> So this dryer fit what I was looking for.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Lightweight and portable, and easily fit into my suitcase for traveling.</li>
            <li> Add to that the great attachments, and the reasonable price, and I would absolutely choose this hair dryer, along with its plethora of ions, all over again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to cool off.  </li>
            <li> In addition, it doesn&#x27;t get very hot or blow that strongly.  </li>
            <li> It was shiny and smooth, more smooth than when I use my straight iron</li>
            <li> It would seem to be a good fit for youngsters just learning how to manage their own hair, and for older people who have lost some upper body strength over the years.</li>
            <li> While the dryer is larger than some my wife has owned it is quite light which is good because she has problems with her grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have to admit that I&#x27;ve had pretty good luck with hair dryers over all, most last over a decade</li>
            <li> if you are this is the dryer for you, it&#x27;s BRIGHT red).</li>
            <li> bright red hair dryer boasts plenty of power and 3 separate temperature and fan settings.  </li>
            <li> 1875 Watt Tourmaline Ceramic 2-in-1 Styler, Cord Reel Dryer]]which also has 1875 watts with 3 heat settings, 2 speed settings and a cool shot button.</li>
            <li> Overall, good hair dryer that runs hotter than others we have had.  </li>
            <li> There is a cool setting which she likes.</li>
            <li> think its a good dryer, I have only used it for a couple of weeks, and do not&lt;br /&gt;notice</li>
            <li> so I know that Samy Big Curls is doing a good job here.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is ideal, as anyone knows that blasting hot air at your hair is extremely damaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> model has most of the required standards of a hair dryer such as 3 heat settings and a 2 speed setting; the motor is 1875 watts along with a cool shot feature that will hold your look in place; there is a removable filter, diffuser, and concentrator and a ionic generator that creates 90% more condition ions which is to leave your hair frizz-free.</li>
            <li> I often hold it by the barrel when straightening my hair which is fine because that part does not get too hot.  </li>
            <li> This particular hair dryer would be better used on someone with shorter, thinner hair.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t have any special success with those either.  </li>
            <li> Good attachments, lightweight, not really loud, removable filter.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with it, and the red color just makes it fun.</li>
            <li> The attachments were a pleasant surprise, as I would not have expected to find both a concentrator and diffuser at this price.  </li>
            <li> longer snoot seems to focus the stream of hot air better, our hair dries faster and the new Remington is significantly quieter.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very light, which is great if you have really long hair, but the extreme lightness and plastic casing contribute to that cheap feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a lot of fun using the diffuser attachment too for a thicker look.</li>
            <li> The attachments included are handy to have, especially the air director.</li>
            <li> gave it 4 star, as it is a good regular everyday Hair Dryer with a good price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get too hot, has 3 temps and 2 speeds and a cool blast if you need it.</li>
            <li> Luckily for me, using the attachments for the first time in my life, I did not have that happen.  </li>
            <li> The first level, runs cool while the second two are warm and hot.</li>
            <li> Snaps right on and off.  </li>
            <li> She says the new unit is light-weight, easy to use, and versatile.</li>
            <li> The attachments were all useful and quite easy to place on the machine and remove...another plus as far as she is concerned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Yes it is powerful, but when it gets hot it shuts off.  </li>
            <li> (She didn&#x27;t express an opinion about the \\&quot;cool shot\\&quot; feature saying she didn&#x27;t use it much as she didn&#x27;t see the need.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really say for sure that my hair has more shine or is any smoother after using it instead of any other hair dryer despite the advertising claims.  </li>
            <li> Although it has the same wattage, it seems more powerful.</li>
            <li> It is not particularly small or light weight and reminds me of hair dryers I used years ago.</li>
            <li> The alternative would be a good 30mins with the straight iron trying to get it to smooth out and lay flat enough to resemble some sort of style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this unit since Feb 2015, after striking out with a different brands cord-keeper model.  </li>
            <li> I feel that the seller willingly sold me a defective item.</li>
            <li> It has plenty of power, plenty of heat, and attachments that rival the higher priced hair dryers.  </li>
            <li> and it works as well as it did when I first purchased</li>
            <li> Hot Rod of Hair Dryers.&#x27;</li>
            <li> If you want a dryer to boost volume and add some shine, there is not reason to spend 50 dollars or more when you can spend 20 max on this product and have the same results.</li>
            <li> The plug has a reset button and I had to use it the first time I even tried the dryer.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There are two control switches, the first is the on/off and high/low switch.</li>
            <li> The Second is the temperature control switch with three levels and this is the aspect I love.</li>
            <li> The various settings (3) are a nice feature and so far it has shown to deserve five stars.</li>
            <li> Therefore I really enjoy that I have the option to run on a cool cycle throughout my blow dry.</li>
            <li> My wife comments that she forgot to use conditioner this morning, but her hair came out silky smooth because of the ionic generator.&lt;br /&gt;And, of course, a red hair dryer looks pretty hot on the bathroom sink.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been able to dry it in under 4 minutes.</li>
            <li> the most they would do is dry my hair before bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Then I bought a Conair Infiniti which I also returned because even on low the intensity was so strong my shoulder length hair kept getting all snarled and knotted.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Based on this, the unit certainly deserves a five-star rating.</li>
            <li> G Remington D3020 Volume and Shine Hair Dryer]] is a powerful hair dryer that is a lot better than previous hair dryers we have had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is very light weight but not very portable.  </li>
            <li> recently read, in fact, that you should be treating your hair as if it were a fine cashmere sweater.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If it lasts at least 5 years like the old one, we will be happy.</li>
            <li> However, there is one huge standout feature on this Remington model that I especially like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found 2 ways that work very well with it.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally straight (with some wave when it&#x27;s shorter).</li>
            <li> It does this very well.</li>
            <li> I really thought that was going to be just a gimmick.</li>
            <li> Longevity-wise, not so much.</li>
            <li> Two attachments are included: a diffuser for waves and curls as well s a concentrator for straight hair.</li>
            <li> My wife really likes this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> of all, this hair dryer adds volume and is offered at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> , really didn&#x27;t change this process at all...</li>
            <li> My daughter and granddaughter both have used this Hair Dryer and have found it to be very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I dont really understand this generator product but the device works well</li>
            <li> It feels very lightweight and you get some heat/cool settings to play with.</li>
            <li> much movement drying as my Revlon dryer does.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I gave it a shot without really being motivated.</li>
            <li> But the concentrator nozzle on the Conair was almost too much</li>
            <li> I also used the concentrator attachment for straight hair and it looked like</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not a heavy dryer, more lite weight, but using a smaller dryer, is lighter then this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is a pretty standard hair dryer with two speeds and three heat settings plus a \\&quot;cool shot to set style in place.\\</li>
            <li> The red color is pretty cool, too.</li>
            <li> less than 2 and a half years is very good usage value.</li>
            <li> &quot; that provides \\&quot;90% more ions for extreme volume &amp; shine.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> With this one I&#x27;m able to make my hair dry straight instead of making me look like an old school rabbi.</li>
            <li> It makes a huge difference in the look of my spiky short new pixie cut.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also seems to make my hair fuller on top where it has thinned slightly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that when I plugged this unit into my main bathroom counters outlet, it would trip the circuit breaker.</li>
            <li> This particular dryer is nothing special.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use this only for quick scalp drying</li>
            <li> For the money it&#x27;s a pretty good buy, but not ideal for everyone.</li>
            <li> The Remington D3020 Volume and Shine Hair Dryer comes highly recommended.</li>
            <li> highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> First dryer had a really good review online, yet was a total failure in reality.</li>
            <li> If I want a style with a little more oomph though, this product does the trick.</li>
            <li> My first impression was that it looked and felt a little cheap.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used it I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, it&#x27;s a bit heavier than my last</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has more power than one we bought a few years ago (Vidal Sassoon \\&quot;Ionizer\\&quot; VS785).</li>
            <li> /&gt;Having a brand new hairdryer to use after I washed it was eye opening for me.  </li>
            <li> I needed a new dryer.</li>
            <li> and I have a more heavy duty dryer for when I need to completely blow-dry all my hair.</li>
            <li> After that I have given it few more trials so far I am seeing the same result as the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was set to not like this one because the other one was more my style visually.</li>
            <li> Hot Red FireEngineRed.</li>
            <li> (Do be careful of the high heat setting as it is indeed hot!)</li>
            <li> only thing I cannot figure out is, how to clean out the lint that cumulates in the back of a hair</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice it at first because I stand close to the outlet, but when I went to dry my daughter&#x27;s hair, it didn&#x27;t reach where she normally stands.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve certainly heard noisier hair dryers though this is far from silent.  </li>
            <li> For the most basic of needs it works quite well, but be prepared to spend a little while under the dryer.</li>
            <li> I was suprised to find how soft my hair felt after using it.</li>
            <li> No gimmicks like \\&quot;ion\\&quot; or anything, just a solid hair dryer at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This means that vigorous towel drying is NOT recommended; only gentle drying in every way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Remington, on all speeds and settings, respects the manner in which hair should be dried.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use that attachment 90% of the time when finalizing a style, and want to lock it in place without completely re-arranging it.</li>
            <li> My wife and I have adopted the Remington D3020 Volume &amp; Shine Hair Dryer as our preferred hair dryer, relegating our old Brand X dryer to the guest</li>
            <li> it is also extremely loud.  </li>
            <li> My hair is nearly waist-length and quite wavy</li>
            <li> I bought this hair dryer to replace an old ConAir dryer that wasn&#x27;t putting out sufficient air.</li>
            <li> have medium  thick colored weave in my hair ,kind of short hair, and did not find this hair dryer gave my hair</li>
            <li> But so far so good, and it&#x27;s seen heavy use for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I normally use the concentrator attachment to dry my hair straight.</li>
            <li> This is great for me as I typically hate using my hairdryer when is it hot out, or I still need to cool down after a workout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For me, I want one that genuinely gets HOT as I have very coarse, thick hair.  </li>
            <li> First I had purchased the Revlon Matte Chrome Full-Size Turbo Hair Dryer - RV473V1 on Amazon, but sent it back as it only got lukewarm.</li>
            <li> But now my hair has completely changed from fine straight &amp; light to curly, course and dark which my last dryer seemed to make worse.</li>
            <li> But it does dry your hair relatively quickly at a reasonable cost</li>
            <li> short in a traditional parted cut, it hasn&#x27;t been really necessary.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> This hairdryer has multiple heat settings and multiple airflow settings, which I found unusual for a product in this price range.  </li>
            <li> In addition, its fairly quiet (as hair dryers go) and easy to manage because its not too heavy.&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a concentrator, which is almost a must, and it is vented a little on the sides to keep from sizzling your hair off, or sizzling the hair dryer, or starting an electrical fire when you forget what you are doing and hold it too close to your hair.  </li>
            <li> so it didn&#x27;t fit in the small drawer, but that isn&#x27;t a big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s reasonably priced, seems to be well made &amp; should stand up to the rigors of daily use by 3 people for a long time.</li>
            <li> anything different in drying my hair then using my old dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this new hair dryer along with a couple of Samy Big Curls products and my hair came back to life.&lt;br /&gt;I am still using my &amp;#34;old&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I shave my head, but I live in a house of folks with long hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is a little bigger than her old one (also a Remington which stopped working right recently after 5 years of use)</li>
            <li> My hair has a tendency to be on the frizzy side whether I use a hair dryer or not so when I used this, I expected much the same.  </li>
            <li> Our daughter started using this dryer and completely switched over from her much more expensive unit from another manufacturer.</li>
            <li> dont agree with some other reviewers that find the red color too much to bear.</li>
            <li> normally I&#x27;d just go to bed with wet hair or let it airdry before bed.</li>
            <li> With the old Vidal Sassoon it took about 10 minutes (long hair), but with the Remington it only takes about five, even though both have the same wattage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had also recently junked two ConAir flat irons because they quit working, so I wanted to divorce ConAir altogether when  it became apparent</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line: If you have thin, fine hair this might be what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not huge on hair styling these days, cliché or not I do rock the \\&quot;mommy ponytail\\&quot; more often than I should, or at least I did before this blow dryer.</li>
            <li> The issue is I take a shower at night, it&#x27;s the only time I can really be alone and relax at the end of a long day without little people standing outside of the shower...</li>
            <li> I had flat ironed my hair.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this unit since Feb 2015, after striking out with a different brands cord-keeper model.  I was set to not like this one because the other one was more my style visually. I have come to Love this hair dryer. I have long hair and I&#x27;ve been able to dry it in under 4 minutes. I watched a few videos on youtube to see how to use the defuser (volumizer to me) attachment. I&#x27;ve found 2 ways that work very well with it. My hair is naturally straight (with some wave when it&#x27;s shorter). I normally use the concentrator attachment to dry my hair straight. It does this very well. If i dry it upside-down I can come out looking like the lion king Ha.  I&#x27;ve had a lot of fun using the diffuser attachment too for a thicker look. I often hold it by the barrel when straightening my hair which is fine because that part does not get too hot.  Does ceramic technology work? I have to give a resounding Yes. I really thought that was going to be just a gimmick. I was suprised to find how soft my hair felt after using it. One of the tricks I&#x27;ve learned is not to try for bone dry.  Also- the photo here is not as red as the actual unit. It is RedRed.Hot Red FireEngineRed. It is not quite as heavy or as loud as the other brands cord-keeper model.  I&#x27;ve found that when I plugged this unit into my main bathroom counters outlet, it would trip the circuit breaker. When i moved to the other outlet in the room it solved the problem. I believe that would be a problem with any hair dryer of this wattage in my home. Before my bout of hair dryer trials I used one hair dryer for over 30 yrs.  UPDATE:  Over a year later and it is still working fine. Final Update: This unit lasted 2 years and 5 months before it quit working.  Performace-wise it was a great hairdryer. Longevity-wise, not so much. I will definitely replace it with an ion type dryer tho probably not a Remington since I don&#x27;t think less than 2 and a half years is very good usage value.</li>
            <li> Great results on medium heat.</li>
            <li> Have had the item for less than 2 months and today it caught on fire. Smoke coming out the nozzle of the hair dryer. I feel that the seller willingly sold me a defective item.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had an hair dryer before and as I wear my hair&lt;br /&gt;pretty short in a traditional parted cut, it hasn&#x27;t been really necessary.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is thinning as I age and the hair dryer tends to dry my scalp as well,&lt;br /&gt;but it is pleasant and my hair looks better after a shower&lt;br /&gt;not all wet and clustered up. They call my type of hair salt and pepper&lt;br /&gt;and I have had trouble with very dry scape in the past&lt;br /&gt;so a little drying goes a long way. This dryer rapidly dried my hair&lt;br /&gt;and only seconds instead of minutes were needed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many hair dryers over the years, from high-end to drugstore brands.  This particular dryer is nothing special.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, it is very lightweight, so might be a good choice for someone with impaired arm strength.  But the reason it&#x27;s so light is it&#x27;s very cheaply made.  In addition, it doesn&#x27;t get very hot or blow that strongly.  Every time I use it I stop to see if I have it turned all the way up.  It also has an abnormally short cord.  I didn&#x27;t notice it at first because I stand close to the outlet, but when I went to dry my daughter&#x27;s hair, it didn&#x27;t reach where she normally stands.  Never had that problem with other dryers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And if I may address the \\&quot;ionic generator creates 90% more conditioning ions, leaving you frizz-free\\&quot; nonsense.... come on.  It sucks air in one end, heats it, and blows it out the other.  There are no magical particles inside waiting to give you the hair of your dreams.  Alas, wish it was true, but it&#x27;s not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, while this dryer isn&#x27;t horrible, there really is no compelling reason to buy it.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is great for the price.  It has plenty of power, plenty of heat, and attachments that rival the higher priced hair dryers.  It is very light weight but not very portable.  My hair has a tendency to be on the frizzy side whether I use a hair dryer or not so when I used this, I expected much the same.  Luckily for me, using the attachments for the first time in my life, I did not have that happen.  At least not immediately.</li>
            <li> The [[ASIN:B00AILKE6G Remington D3020 Volume and Shine Hair Dryer]] is fine, but there is no noticeable benefit from its \\&quot;ionic ceramic technology\\&quot; that provides \\&quot;90% more ions for extreme volume &amp; shine.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like many hair dryers, this one has 1875 watts  with 3 heat settings, 2 speed settings and a cool shot button.  Two attachments are included: a diffuser for waves and curls as well s a concentrator for straight hair. The air filter is removable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer the [[ASIN:B000R80ZTQ Infiniti by Conair 223XR, 1875 Watt Tourmaline Ceramic 2-in-1 Styler, Cord Reel Dryer]]which also has 1875 watts with 3 heat settings, 2 speed settings and a cool shot button. Although it has the same wattage, it seems more powerful. I also like that it has a button to retract the cord into the handle - no need to wrap the cord around it or use a rubber band.  I&#x27;ve had mine since July 2009 and it works as well as it did when I first purchased it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Remington D3020 hair dryer will be available to my overnight guests. I am sticking with the Infiniti by Conair for myself.</li>
            <li> My wife really likes this hair dryer.  The bright red color stands out and my wife is happy with the color.  Even on a low setting, this hair dryer gets the job done with ease.  It is a little bigger than her old one (also a Remington which stopped working right recently after 5 years of use) so it didn&#x27;t fit in the small drawer, but that isn&#x27;t a big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best of all, this hair dryer adds volume and is offered at a reasonable price.  If it lasts at least 5 years like the old one, we will be happy.</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife. According to her, it works well and has all the features that are standard for hair dryers these days: three heat settings and two fan settings. No gimmicks like \\&quot;ion\\&quot; or anything, just a solid hair dryer at a reasonable price. And I can attest that my wife&#x27;s hair has indeed been dry every morning, so it works. I&#x27;m sorry I can&#x27;t be more effusive or descriptive, but it&#x27;s not like these were invented last year...</li>
            <li> Overall, good hair dryer that runs hotter than others we have had.  No negatives!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+s&lt;br /&gt;3 heat levels&lt;br /&gt;2 speeds&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-s&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;none&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, would recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not huge on hair styling these days, cliché or not I do rock the \\&quot;mommy ponytail\\&quot; more often than I should, or at least I did before this blow dryer. The issue is I take a shower at night, it&#x27;s the only time I can really be alone and relax at the end of a long day without little people standing outside of the shower... normally I&#x27;d just go to bed with wet hair or let it airdry before bed. Then I&#x27;d wake up with bed head, do my best to smash it down and toss in a ponytail. The alternative would be a good 30mins with the straight iron trying to get it to smooth out and lay flat enough to resemble some sort of style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other blow dryers I&#x27;ve had in the past (including another ionic Remington), really didn&#x27;t change this process at all... the most they would do is dry my hair before bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one seriously changed my life in a little way. The first time I used it I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, it&#x27;s a bit heavier than my last and and I&#x27;m not a huge fan of red (if you are this is the dryer for you, it&#x27;s BRIGHT red). However I was shocked when I was done drying my hair. It was shiny and smooth, more smooth than when I use my straight iron and it was done way faster. The best surprise was the next morning when I got up and it was STILL perfectly smooth and shiny. I was able to be out the door in mins without ever even warming up my straightening iron and without the dreaded mommy ponytail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great blow dryer, great deal!</li>
            <li> I shave my head, but I live in a house of folks with long hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have thick Asian hair, lush wavy, and a couple thinning curly types.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every person who used the dryer had good things to say about how efficient it was at drying hair, not drying out hair, or frizzing it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;The Hot Rod of Hair Dryers.&#x27; Actual quote.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended</li>
            <li> This blow dryer does what a dryer is supposed to do - it dries your hair. I&#x27;m an older man who still has his long hair &amp; in the past just drying my hair has been enough. But now my hair has completely changed from fine straight &amp; light to curly, course and dark which my last dryer seemed to make worse. With this one I&#x27;m able to make my hair dry straight instead of making me look like an old school rabbi. It also seems to make my hair fuller on top where it has thinned slightly. My wife &amp; daughter also say it works great for all their more rigorous styling needs. It&#x27;s reasonably priced, seems to be well made &amp; should stand up to the rigors of daily use by 3 people for a long time. The Remington D3020 Volume and Shine Hair Dryer comes highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I received this hair dryer almost a month ago and from reports from my family it is a good choice. My daughter and granddaughter both have used this Hair Dryer and have found it to be very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This model has most of the required standards of a hair dryer such as 3 heat settings and a 2 speed setting; the motor is 1875 watts along with a cool shot feature that will hold your look in place; there is a removable filter, diffuser, and concentrator and a ionic generator that creates 90% more condition ions which is to leave your hair frizz-free. I dont really understand this generator product but the device works well so I will leave it at that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dont agree with some other reviewers that find the red color too much to bear. I find it OK and would probably choose it if I had a choice. Not a big problem but one to address.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I realize this is really a short, standard review of this hair dryer but it kind of does what it is designed to do in a rather straight forward manner. The price appears to be about average and over-all I think it will do as suggested.</li>
            <li> This is a great hair dryer.  It can be very hard to tell online or looking at packages how well a dryer will work.  For me, I want one that genuinely gets HOT as I have very coarse, thick hair.  I also want one that puts out a lot of air.  I&#x27;m happy to report that this dryer does both of those things well.  It&#x27;s not wimpy in any way. I am very pleased with it, and the red color just makes it fun.</li>
            <li> The [[ASIN:B00AILKE6G Remington D3020 Volume and Shine Hair Dryer]] is a powerful hair dryer that is a lot better than previous hair dryers we have had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has more power than one we bought a few years ago (Vidal Sassoon \\&quot;Ionizer\\&quot; VS785). This one is also an ionizer hair dryer and the size is the same, but it is slightly lighter, and so a little easier to hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also takes less time to dry hair. With the old Vidal Sassoon it took about 10 minutes (long hair), but with the Remington it only takes about five, even though both have the same wattage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is a quality product that I&#x27;ve put to use recently. Good variable speeds and it does the job. The weight is just right and the construction and quality is excellent. The various settings (3) are a nice feature and so far it has shown to deserve five stars. It works...it does its job with quality....Good product.</li>
            <li> I just gave up the valiant fight with my hair, and cut it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always cut my hair myself, and I am not too bad at it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having a brand new hairdryer to use after I washed it was eye opening for me.  I had been using a very poor quality, very old hairdryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This roaring red (!!!) Remington D3020 Volume and Shine Hair Dryer is a fantastic change for the better, for me. It makes a huge difference in the look of my spiky short new pixie cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a couple of accessories to snap onto the nozzle to style your hair in different ways.&lt;br /&gt;I tried the black slotted funnel. This is not THE TECHNICAL TERM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The air directs its force at specific areas of your head with this attachment. It snaps on easily and doesn&#x27;t fall off. It was perfect for my hair style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The air itself is slightly cooler than the air from my old hairdryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is ideal, as anyone knows that blasting hot air at your hair is extremely damaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently read, in fact, that you should be treating your hair as if it were a fine cashmere sweater.&lt;br /&gt;This means that vigorous towel drying is NOT recommended; only gentle drying in every way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Remington, on all speeds and settings, respects the manner in which hair should be dried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Remington D3020 touts the number of ions it has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can take that ball and run with it--I have never understood ions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with this hairdryer, however, and with its gentle and cooling drying power. Add to that the great attachments, and the reasonable price, and I would absolutely choose this hair dryer, along with its plethora of ions, all over again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;jean</li>
            <li> My first impression was that it looked and felt a little cheap.  It&#x27;s very light, which is great if you have really long hair, but the extreme lightness and plastic casing contribute to that cheap feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the promised shine and smoothness...eh.  I didn&#x27;t notice any benefit over previous hair dryers I&#x27;ve owned.  It also didn&#x27;t dry my hair any faster.  The attachments work easily and do their job, but I wasn&#x27;t blown away by anything about the Remington Volume and Shine Hair Dryer beyond the price.</li>
            <li> For the price, you cannot go wrong with this dryer. My hair is naturally thick, so I have to be careful when using products or dryers that boost volume. If I want a style with a little more oomph though, this product does the trick. As for the shine, I did notice an improved sheen. Not polished looking, but I did notice a difference. The attachments included are handy to have, especially the air director. I use that attachment 90% of the time when finalizing a style, and want to lock it in place without completely re-arranging it. If you want a dryer to boost volume and add some shine, there is not reason to spend 50 dollars or more when you can spend 20 max on this product and have the same results.</li>
            <li> My wife and I have adopted the Remington D3020 Volume &amp; Shine Hair Dryer as our preferred hair dryer, relegating our old Brand X dryer to the guest bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;The longer snoot seems to focus the stream of hot air better, our hair dries faster and the new Remington is significantly quieter. My wife comments that she forgot to use conditioner this morning, but her hair came out silky smooth because of the ionic generator.&lt;br /&gt;And, of course, a red hair dryer looks pretty hot on the bathroom sink.</li>
            <li> This hairdryer has multiple heat settings and multiple airflow settings, which I found unusual for a product in this price range.  It delivers the volume of airflow necessary to dry long or thick hair.  The attachments were a pleasant surprise, as I would not have expected to find both a concentrator and diffuser at this price.  The weight is perfect, as some of these pistol type dryers can be quite heavy, and are a problem when doing one&#x27;s own hair.  It would seem to be a good fit for youngsters just learning how to manage their own hair, and for older people who have lost some upper body strength over the years.</li>
            <li> I am on the fence about this dryer. Yes it is powerful, but when it gets hot it shuts off.  That may be a safety mechanism, but it doesn&#x27;t make me happy.  The plug has a reset button and I had to use it the first time I even tried the dryer.  it is also extremely loud.  The cats run and hide when I use it.</li>
            <li> This particular hair dryer would be better used on someone with shorter, thinner hair. The power is just not there for someone with thicker, longer or curlier hair. For the most basic of needs it works quite well, but be prepared to spend a little while under the dryer. However I think the price more than makes up for its short-comings. It feels very lightweight and you get some heat/cool settings to play with. It also comes with a couple of diffusers, one of which I never use. My hair is nearly waist-length and quite wavy and it takes forever to dry it with this dryer. I use this only for quick scalp drying and I have a more heavy duty dryer for when I need to completely blow-dry all my hair. For the money it&#x27;s a pretty good buy, but not ideal for everyone.</li>
            <li> I have to admit that I&#x27;ve had pretty good luck with hair dryers over all, most last over a decade (this is my 4th one). However, there is one huge standout feature on this Remington model that I especially like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two control switches, the first is the on/off and high/low switch. The Second is the temperature control switch with three levels and this is the aspect I love. The first level, runs cool while the second two are warm and hot. Sure it also has the cold shot option, but those only run for as long as you hold down the button. Therefore I really enjoy that I have the option to run on a cool cycle throughout my blow dry. This is great for me as I typically hate using my hairdryer when is it hot out, or I still need to cool down after a workout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very, very happy with this feature.</li>
            <li> I have not needed a hair dryer for years but my wife uses them ergo this one went to her. For the price you are getting a lot of dryer here. While the dryer is larger than some my wife has owned it is quite light which is good because she has problems with her grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are three heat settings on this machine and two speeds. There is a cool setting which she likes. (Do be careful of the high heat setting as it is indeed hot!) The attachments were all useful and quite easy to place on the machine and remove...another plus as far as she is concerned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife has absolutely no complaints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don Blankenship&lt;br /&gt;The Ozarks</li>
            <li> Our daughter started using this dryer and completely switched over from her much more expensive unit from another manufacturer. Why? She says the new unit is light-weight, easy to use, and versatile. She finds the blower and temperature settings more than adequate for her hair drying/styling requirements. (She didn&#x27;t express an opinion about the \\&quot;cool shot\\&quot; feature saying she didn&#x27;t use it much as she didn&#x27;t see the need.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on this, the unit certainly deserves a five-star rating. The only thing that we&#x27;re not sure about is how long it will last. It&#x27;s an inexpensive unit (considering its versatility and features) and motor life is the key question. (We&#x27;re not talking about survivability if dropped or anything like that; don&#x27;t drop it on the floor!) But so far so good, and it&#x27;s seen heavy use for a few weeks. We&#x27;re very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> This is a great looking Red Hairdryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have medium  thick colored weave in my hair ,kind of short hair, and did not find this hair dryer gave my hair&lt;br /&gt;as much movement drying as my Revlon dryer does.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t notice any Anti-Friz using this dryer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think its a good dryer, I have only used it for a couple of weeks, and do not&lt;br /&gt;notice anything different in drying my hair then using my old dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not a heavy dryer, more lite weight, but using a smaller dryer, is lighter then this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 4 star, as it is a good regular everyday Hair Dryer with a good price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I cannot figure out is, how to clean out the lint that cumulates in the back of a hair dryer!&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t find anyway of opening this up!</li>
            <li> This is a pretty standard hair dryer with two speeds and three heat settings plus a \\&quot;cool shot to set style in place.\\&quot;  It is not particularly small or light weight and reminds me of hair dryers I used years ago. I&#x27;ve certainly heard noisier hair dryers though this is far from silent.  I can&#x27;t really say for sure that my hair has more shine or is any smoother after using it instead of any other hair dryer despite the advertising claims.  There are two attachments to smooth or wave your hair but I didn&#x27;t have any special success with those either.  But it does dry your hair relatively quickly at a reasonable cost so it gets an OK rating from me.</li>
            <li> I have owned only hair dryer in my life. First dryer had a really good review online, yet was a total failure in reality. It didn&#x27;t work the way it was supposed to and gave me the result that I wasn&#x27;t looking for. It also contributed to my hair damage. After that I shy-ed away from hair dryers or any heated hair tools (unless it&#x27;s done at the salon).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, after many years I took a leap of faith picked this Remington hair dryer from vine. I gave it a shot without really being motivated. My hair is thinning, yet I needed something to quickly dry up my hair in chilly morning before going to work. So this dryer fit what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was impressed by my first trial. It dried up my hair and gave it extra volume. Not sure about shine but I definitely saw volume. I was done with my long hair within few minutes. After that I have given it few more trials so far I am seeing the same result as the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only issue is that the added styling tools they have. I wasn&#x27;t that impressed with them. I had too many stray flyways after I used them. But as a hair dryer it worked excellent for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: If you have thin, fine hair this might be what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
            <li> Everything you need for a little bit of money---what more can you ask for today!!!!! I&#x27;m glad I gave it a try. I have very thin hair and this was recommended to me by a hairstylist. She didn&#x27;t steer me wrong!</li>
            <li> If you need a hair dryer, I would recommend this one.  It&#x27;s easy to cool off.  The red color is pretty cool, too.</li>
            <li> I have always wanted to try the attachments that come with the hairdryers.  You know, like that diffuser circle?  They always hurt, and I threw them away after a couple of times.  This one didn&#x27;t get my hair all tangled in it, and it added volume and shine to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;It has three settings, from cool to warm to hot that are easily adjustable while drying your hair.  Lightweight and portable, and easily fit into my suitcase for traveling.</li>
            <li> I rarely need a hair dryer, but when I do its nice to have one that works well. This fits the bill, plus it&#x27;s attractive and looks nice on my counter top.</li>
            <li> This Remington brand hair dryer replaces a Conair I owned and thought I loved.  But the concentrator nozzle on the Conair was almost too much and if I wasn&#x27;t careful the dryer would overheat and shut itself off.&lt;br /&gt;This bright red hair dryer boasts plenty of power and 3 separate temperature and fan settings.  Sometimes you need that kind of versatility.  In addition, its fairly quiet (as hair dryers go) and easy to manage because its not too heavy.&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a concentrator, which is almost a must, and it is vented a little on the sides to keep from sizzling your hair off, or sizzling the hair dryer, or starting an electrical fire when you forget what you are doing and hold it too close to your hair.  The diffuser is also a handy gadget for those days you want to go curly.  Snaps right on and off.  At this price point, this hair dryer is a good buy.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I bought this hair dryer to replace an old ConAir dryer that wasn&#x27;t putting out sufficient air. I had also recently junked two ConAir flat irons because they quit working, so I wanted to divorce ConAir altogether when  it became apparent I needed a new dryer. This Remington dryer puts out a lot of wind and I was able to dry my hair (which is very thick) in probably half the amount of time. It has three heat settings and I used the lowest one, which is pretty much cold air. I also used the concentrator attachment for straight hair and it looked like I had flat ironed my hair. The next morning it still looked like this. Combine the use of this dryer with the use of a Remington T-Studio flat iron, I have a glossy salon-quality finish I neverha d before. I would recommend this dryer to everyone, especially people with long thick hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this hair dryer locally after 2 strikeouts on other dryers. First I had purchased the Revlon Matte Chrome Full-Size Turbo Hair Dryer - RV473V1 on Amazon, but sent it back as it only got lukewarm. Then I bought a Conair Infiniti which I also returned because even on low the intensity was so strong my shoulder length hair kept getting all snarled and knotted. I figured it was because the opening of the nozzle was too big, so I set out to find one that was narrower. This dryer works perfectly. Doesn&#x27;t get too hot, has 3 temps and 2 speeds and a cool blast if you need it. Good attachments, lightweight, not really loud, removable filter. Ionic/ceramic. The color is not my favorite, but what matters is it works.</li>
            <li> I like it a lot although I have used it only once. Now, I know when it is time to change my hair dryer. I have had my previous one for seven years and lately my hair looked dull and lifeless. I bought this new hair dryer along with a couple of Samy Big Curls products and my hair came back to life.&lt;br /&gt;I am still using my &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; hair dryer so I know that Samy Big Curls is doing a good job here.</li>
