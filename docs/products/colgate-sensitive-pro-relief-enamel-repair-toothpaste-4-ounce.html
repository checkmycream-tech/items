    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>It has worked beautifully for me.</li>
            <li>Great product and service</li>
            <li>I will continue to use this toothpaste, as it does a great job of cleaning, while providing sensitivity control.</li>
            <li>My favorite toothpaste!</li>
            <li>I used it and it worked faster and better than anything I had used before.</li>
            <li>I was pleased to find it online.</li>
            <li>I wish everyone would call and complain to the Co. and request that they start back the manufacturing of this tooth paste because it is absolutely wonderful.  </li>
            <li>Will Order more.</li>
            <li>I also use a Sonic Care tooth brush which I&#x27;m sure also helps.</li>
            <li>My tooth is not 100% yet but compared to what it used to be, there is a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>I wish it were still widely available in the States.</li>
            <li>Seems to be good so far.</li>
            <li>My local Walmart ran out &amp; I tried what appeared to be the next best thing, the crest clinical sensitive paste, but it didn&#x27;t seem to be as effective &amp; my gums have been more inflamed.</li>
            <li>My ultimate goal is to replace my real teeth with implants to get rid of the sensitivity for good, but until I hit a jackpot somewhere, this will have to do:)</li>
            <li>and I ran out quickly.</li>
            <li>This seems to help my sensitive teeth and also my teeth feel smooth and healthy.</li>
            <li>Here is my quick product review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>) Works quickly.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had sensitive teeth for many years now</li>
            <li>Of all the different brands and formulations of sensitivity pastes I&#x27;ve used I have found that Colgate Sensitive Pro Relief has been the most effective paste I have ever used for this issue.</li>
            <li>I consider it to be worth every penny.</li>
            <li>It worked after the first brushing.</li>
            <li>After a sample of this toothpaste was provided by my dentist, it was evident that it helped with some sensitivity at the gum line after having a crown added to one of my teeth.  </li>
            <li>It has a higher level of Fluoride which helps to rebuild the tooth enamel which decreases the sensitivity over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great toothpaste and was having trouble finding product in the store and will order again in the future.</li>
            <li>No burning, very tasteful, and really cleans.</li>
            <li>) Works very well for me and reduced my sensitivity</li>
            <li>Make sure you are buying the Pro-Relief since Colgate makes a number of different sensitive toothpaste brands.</li>
            <li>It absolutely works better than any other for sensitivity.  </li>
            <li>When we run out of this recent purchase, we will definitely be ordering more.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>would highly recommend this product over others.  </li>
            <li>Found a good price on Amazon, the product was hard for me to find in my local stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>gtreat toothpaste for sensitive teeth!</li>
            <li>My dentist had just put in a porcelain crown and my tooth became extremely sensitive.  </li>
            <li>and wow, am I surprised.  </li>
            <li>I used Colgate sensitive multiprotection toothpaste before this came out.</li>
            <li>if you have sensitive teeth, this is the one for you.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using \\&quot;Colgate Sensitive Pro-Relief\\&quot; Enamel Repair Toothpaste for about 7 months after the dentist gave me this toothpaste to try and said it may help to repair my enamel and with my sensitivity issues.</li>
            <li>I read several reviews and decided to buy two bottles of Colgate Sensitive Pro-Relief.  </li>
            <li>The one on the market now, which says sensitive, actually burns my mouth.  </li>
            <li>No Bitter Taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a very unusual mint taste, different than any other toothpaste I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>I had just started to get some gum line sensitivity and my Dentist highly recommended over Sensodyne and other brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Great product and service</li>
            <li> The Sensitivity ingredient works well.  It has a very unusual mint taste, different than any other toothpaste I&#x27;ve tried.  You&#x27;ll either love it or hate it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had sensitive teeth for many years now and I have used various products for it. Of all the different brands and formulations of sensitivity pastes I&#x27;ve used I have found that Colgate Sensitive Pro Relief has been the most effective paste I have ever used for this issue. It was given to me as a sample by my dental hygienist. I used it and it worked faster and better than anything I had used before. It was, a small tube and I ran out quickly. My biggest disappointment  was being completely unable to find this product in local stores. I was pleased to find it online. Though ordering it online is more expensive-I consider it to be worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Does work as advertised.  Will reorder.</li>
            <li> My dentist had just put in a porcelain crown and my tooth became extremely sensitive.  Even drinking cool water was uncomfortable.  I read several reviews and decided to buy two bottles of Colgate Sensitive Pro-Relief.  I have used this toothpaste for almost a month and wow, am I surprised.  My tooth is not 100% yet but compared to what it used to be, there is a huge difference.  I can now drink colder beverages without any problems.  I was skeptical like most people but you need to be patient and give it time to work.  I can say that it worked for me.</li>
            <li> My wife and I looked for this specific type of toothpaste and could not find it in any local stores.  It absolutely works better than any other for sensitivity.  When we run out of this recent purchase, we will definitely be ordering more.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dentist but I could not find locally. Works well foe me</li>
            <li> I think it was a horrible mistake for Colgate to stop making this particular toothpaste.  The one on the market now, which says sensitive, actually burns my mouth.  I wish everyone would call and complain to the Co. and request that they start back the manufacturing of this tooth paste because it is absolutely wonderful.  there is none like it anymore.  No burning, very tasteful, and really cleans.</li>
            <li> This was falsely advertised as having pro-argin. Could have bought the same thing for half the price anywhere local. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I used Colgate sensitive multiprotection toothpaste before this came out. I felt a difference within a week of use! I&#x27;ve got weak spots on the tip of a couple front teeth that have chipped or become brittle over time, but when using this stuff it seemed to smooth out the rough edges. My local Walmart ran out &amp; I tried what appeared to be the next best thing, the crest clinical sensitive paste, but it didn&#x27;t seem to be as effective &amp; my gums have been more inflamed. My ultimate goal is to replace my real teeth with implants to get rid of the sensitivity for good, but until I hit a jackpot somewhere, this will have to do:)</li>
            <li> Prompt delivery, Just what I wanted. Will Order more.</li>
            <li> I was prone to tooth sensitivity and my dentist recommended this as treatment. It worked after the first brushing. I can drink hot or cold liquids without any discomfort. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Seems to be good so far. Recommended by dentist but not available locally</li>
            <li> After a sample of this toothpaste was provided by my dentist, it was evident that it helped with some sensitivity at the gum line after having a crown added to one of my teeth.  Within a week, the sensitivity was GONE.  I will continue to use this toothpaste, as it does a great job of cleaning, while providing sensitivity control.</li>
            <li> Great toothpaste and was having trouble finding product in the store and will order again in the future.</li>
            <li> My dental hygienist recommended this for sensitivity and it does work in time.  I hate the price and difficulty finding the product, but I will keep using as it has helped.</li>
            <li> if you have sensitive teeth, this is the one for you.  And for you paste lovers, this is it.  No gel here!</li>
            <li> This seems to help my sensitive teeth and also my teeth feel smooth and healthy.</li>
            <li> This is not the toothpaste that I received!</li>
            <li> My favorite toothpaste! I wish it were still widely available in the States.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using \\&quot;Colgate Sensitive Pro-Relief\\&quot; Enamel Repair Toothpaste for about 7 months after the dentist gave me this toothpaste to try and said it may help to repair my enamel and with my sensitivity issues. Last month when I went back for a cleaning I was so surprised to find I had little to no tarter buildup and I had no sensitivity issues. Even the oral hygienist said she was surprised at how little tarter I had. The only thing different since the prior checkup was the toothpaste. I also use a Sonic Care tooth brush which I&#x27;m sure also helps.</li>
            <li> It has worked beautifully for me.</li>
            <li> the description says Exclusive Pro-Argin  Formula...there is no arginine in this toothpaste...you can buy this at any store in the USA</li>
            <li> Here is my quick product review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Works quickly.  It has a higher level of Fluoride which helps to rebuild the tooth enamel which decreases the sensitivity over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) No Bitter Taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) I had just started to get some gum line sensitivity and my Dentist highly recommended over Sensodyne and other brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) Cleans just as well as other brands of toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5) Found a good price on Amazon, the product was hard for me to find in my local stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6) Works very well for me and reduced my sensitivity significantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product over others.  Make sure you are buying the Pro-Relief since Colgate makes a number of different sensitive toothpaste brands.</li>
            <li> gtreat toothpaste for sensitive teeth!</li>
            <li> This is the only stuff that works for me.  I will be ordering this soon.</li>
