            <li>I love all Neutrogena products, they are great!</li>
            <li>Good buy, doesnt &amp;#34;tint&amp;#34; your face but makes it appear more flawless and shrinks the look of pores.</li>
            <li>This is amazing reduces brown spots and blemishes and great texture that does not clog the pores</li>
            <li>Not too good for summer time because it sweats off since it isnt water resistant.</li>
            <li>Smells good, feels good</li>
            <li>I am a fair skin women in my 50 &#x27; s</li>
            <li>This is a really good investment.</li>
            <li>I kept hearing good things about this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>The smell does tend to fade away as the day goes on though, so that&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>This was a good price, I like moisturizers with SPF in them.</li>
            <li>Read the good reviews of Neutrogena Visibly Even and decided to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>So, I searched around on the good ol&#x27; internets for awhile and decided to switch my foundation and moisturizer to Neutrogena products, as they seemed to be favorably</li>
            <li>good luck.&lt;br</li>
            <li>which—like all good products—seems to have been discontinued.</li>
            <li>So light and smells great!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know about the &amp;#34;evening&amp;#34; effects, but my skin looks and feels good.</li>
            <li>This stuff is good.</li>
            <li>I was excited when I found this moisturizer with great reviews with great price.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the texture, smell and how it really is a great sunblock under makeup,</li>
            <li>it okay great moisturizer.</li>
            <li>This product met my expectations and I am very pleased with the feeling it leaves on my skin.  </li>
            <li>It is not oily and disappears into my skin leaving a nice feel and good foundation for my makeup.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t recommend this more!</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>My doctor recommended SPF 30 or higher for my face and this has worked perfectly.</li>
            <li>love it!</li>
            <li>My face looks better now than it did 10 years ago!</li>

            <li>I absolutely love this moisturizer!</li>
            <li>would love to see it!</li>
            <li>In addition to drinking more water this product has cleared my skin drastically!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love this moisturizer!</li>
            <li>Excellent results exactly what I needed</li>
            <li>I love Neutrogena products!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied with this one!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used a better moisturizer in my life!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this moisturizer!</li>
            <li>LOVE this Neutrogena product!</li>
            <li>I thought it would be a bit more pleasant on the face</li>
            <li>I have to say that this is an amazing product.  </li>
            <li>Thank you Neutrogena for making amazing products.</li>
            <li>It evens my skin tone and brightens it gives it an amazing glow.</li>
            <li>just a side not, you are not going to get an amazing face by just using drugstore/any cleanser.</li>
            <li>have NOTHING but amazing things to say about this product.</li>
            <li>The reason for the four stars is that it&#x27;s not quite as moisturizing as I would have liked.</li>
            <li>still waiting but definitly nice as moisturizer.</li>
            <li>after trying another kind</li>
            <li>so it is perfect for summer time when heavier lotions can be too much.</li>
            <li>I wear it on work days under beauty balm in the summer, and on it&#x27;s own on the weekends.</li>
            <li>I am absolutely thrilled to see this</li>
            <li>I apply it each morning and honestly could not be happier with the results.</li>
            <li>It smells nice and is not greasy.</li>
            <li>It goes on nicely and does not irritate my skin.  </li>
            <li>Nice moisturizer with&lt;br /&gt;30 SPF.  </li>
            <li>Feels nice.</li>
            <li>Nice and cushy at first, but then after about a week or so of using it it gets watery?</li>
            <li>This is the first neutrogena product I bought after reading to the many awesome neutrogena reviews everywhere.</li>
            <li>This product is very easy to apply, does what it says it can do and is a keeper.</li>
            <li>so it wont come off with sweat, absorbs very easily</li>
            <li>I love this product, together with the night antiwrinkle cream, you may not be able to guess my age!</li>
            <li>Gives the appearance of a flawless natural glow</li>
            <li>Give it a shot, it&#x27;s by far the best skin care product I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li>Mild, pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>Gotta honor our temples right, lol :-)</li>
            <li>It is like a very light makeup that contains sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>It goes on very light, and does it&#x27;s job.  </li>
            <li>Very light texture</li>
            <li>Good price and quick delivery.</li>
            <li>This one is not greasy at all, goes on nicely and absorbs very quickly.</li>
            <li>The best part is that it actually works!</li>
            <li>i love it but still did not see results in terms of fading my acne scar.</li>
            <li>This was the one product that worked perfectly for clearing up red, blotchy skin and evening-out skin tone.</li>
            <li>I also didn&#x27;t notice any more \\&quot;evenness\\&quot; in my complexion at all....</li>
            <li>I have enjoyed this product.  </li>
            <li>I will buy more when I run out.</li>
            <li>Mostly Monday through Friday and even though I don&#x27;t think it works for fading spots.</li>
            <li>I use these the most for care of my skin.</li>
            <li>me say that this is definitely more of a sunscreen than a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t ever have to buy a better moisturizer ever since I found about this.</li>
            <li>I still love the product and will return to it after the heat starts to drop.</li>
            <li>However, I still love this product.  </li>
            <li>love this moisturizer...</li>
            <li>I did love the fact it was SPF 50 though.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t help either, but I use  Ben Nye Luxury Powder on top and the shine is gone.&lt;br /&gt;#3.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice as a moisturizer and light sunscreen, but it&#x27;s a tad bit on the oily side.</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>It says so on the box, but might as well mention it to be safe.)</li>
            <li>It is not greasy and one thing I really love about it is that it is almost like a primer for my makeup.  </li>
            <li>I have noticed my powder goes better and seems to cover my imperfections better.</li>
            <li>Love it and works well.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t want any more.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>overall the best moisturizer i have used.the spf is also a plus!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this product and order it time and time again.</li>
            <li>I uasually love Neutrogena products.  </li>
            <li>i love it</li>
            <li>Love this moisturizer!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many lotions, serums, scrubs, masks...even green-light therapy...with no results.  </li>
            <li>and i love Neutrogena.</li>
            <li>(your pimples):)</li>
            <li>Love it, will continue to use</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I use Neutrogena sun tan lotion, and love it.  </li>
            <li>This product felt oily on my skin and caused more breakouts and redness than I had before using it.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure the SPF doesn&#x27;t hurt, but</li>
            <li>There are better products on the market than this one.</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>:).</li>
            <li>I love this moisturizer..</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s better than anything I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t get any better than this.</li>
            <li>I really love this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I am on my 4th or 5th bottle! :)</li>
            <li>I LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>we&#x27;re fertile and ready, lol.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll put on some more moisturizer and</li>
            <li>but I like this much better.</li>
            <li>so I end up using a lot more of this product than I thought I&#x27;d need.</li>
            <li>I mostly like Neutrogena brand items.</li>
            <li>I have been using it on and off since purchase date, mostly on</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just an okay product..</li>
            <li>Was hoping it would have been better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m working on eating very clean.</li>
            <li>I think for great skin, if you have normal skin like me, then this stuff + lots of water will have you \\&quot;glowing\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I have pretty good skin and didn&#x27;t used to use a moisturizer or even a cleanser beforehand, so be forewarned that my review may be biased in that</li>
            <li>Loved it the first time because it went on evenly (no streaking), was 30 spf, and I did not develop any sensitivity.</li>
            <li>Not the best product I&#x27;ve ever used by a long shot.</li>
            <li>Bio Oil is also pretty good for that.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer really does a good job no stickiness and no fragrance except a very clean aroma.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for years as my primary moisturizer, and I love it.</li>
            <li>My skin has this great soft, smooth feeling and visible</li>
            <li>Unlike others I&#x27;ve used, makeup goes on afterward evenly and easily.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and invisible.  </li>
            <li>I am your classic fair and freckled person, so I need sunblock (whether in lotion or clothing form) all the time.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, you would find this to be a good moisturizer, and the price is much better than the moisturizer with sunscreen sold by brand name makeup companies.  </li>
            <li>but I have to be honest and say any effect this had on my skin tone came and went within the first 2 weeks of using it.</li>
            <li>My skin looks vibrant and has a nice healthy glow.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and light and can easily be used underneath makeup without causing any oiliness.</li>
            <li>When it&#x27;s cooler I&#x27;ll play around a bit with the foundation (for foundation and the BB, I have found that Maybelline&#x27;s dreamwhip foundation and their beauty balm work just fine - they aren&#x27;t greasy at all and sit lightly on my skin</li>
            <li>It makes my face very smooth, soft, and it definitely feels great!  </li>
            <li>The best sunscreen hands down!</li>
            <li>Keeps this 58 year old face looking bright and smooth.</li>
            <li>is the only moisturizer I have ever used, but I am really happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product goes on lightly</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel really smooth.</li>
            <li>Makeup did not go on smoothly over this.</li>
            <li>The SPF 30 is also great-the cream goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t make your face look too greasy or shiny.</li>
            <li>I do not wear makeup, so even skin tone is important to me.  </li>
            <li>I gave it four stars because there might just be something more powerful out there, and I have been led to keep looking.</li>
            <li>Light weight feel with 30spf to protect my face every day.</li>
            <li>use this every day straight for eight weeks, and your supposed to have amazing skin.</li>
            <li>The product I received wasn&#x27;t light and felt greasy.</li>
            <li>It made my skin look porcelain smooth (before...</li>
            <li>I wanted to try and smooth over some of my hyperpigmentation and acne scars with this</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and doesn&#x27;t have that SPF scent.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone looking for a light moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>All my family has smooth skin though (and we all just used Noxema).</li>
            <li>It was great as a regular moisturizer, but did not even my skin tone at all.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;tried has caused either a breakout or irritation, but so far so good.  </li>
            <li>But the fact that the skin gets so soft is already a good thing.</li>
            <li>I turned my light on, just so I can make sure I saw everything right</li>
            <li>very nice daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li>However, the light moisturizer leaves your skin feeling clean and your pores unclogged</li>
            <li>This has caused more scarring for me than I had previously and it&#x27;s not that great of a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Works the first time better than this</li>
            <li>I was pleased with the results the first time, that I decided to use it again.  </li>
            <li>I guess that&#x27;s a plus  Original Review:</li>
            <li>It is nice and lightweight and moisturizes perfectly, but every time i use it it comes out weird for awhile.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used  visibly even for many years,  my 20 year old daughter love it too....</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly, and absorbs quickly (as opposed to the Oil of Olay which seemed to take forever to absorb).</li>
            <li>It goes on easily and is quickly absorbed.</li>
            <li>I have to say that I like it better than the Aveeno positively radiant moisturizer, which did not even out my skin tone at all.</li>
            <li>Overall, I would definitely recommend this for anyone looking for a good moisturizer-your skin will look amazing!</li>
            <li>The great thing about this Neutrogena product is that it has SPF 30, and it soaks into my slightly oily skin (and leaves it smelling nice and feeling very soft)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Very nice, haven&#x27;t used long enough to make good review</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t looking for a deep wrinkle remover, just something to make my skin bright and</li>
            <li>the visibly even helps my skin the best because it really eliminates dark spots over time.  </li>
            <li>Smells good, which is definitely a plus.  </li>
            <li>I use the Neutrogena nighttime moisturizer and loved, and thought this would have been a similar experience.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to find anything that hydrates like this since my rosacea became much worse.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but I know it works because my skin feels much softer and better.</li>
            <li>Love it for the protection but the smell is so off putting and smells too much like sunscreen.</li>
            <li>However, the smell is pleasant and does not linger for long.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really amazing and does much more than I expected.</li>
            <li>However, I do want to stress that this hasn&#x27;t solved my mild acne on my lower cheeks where I&#x27;ve never had a problem with oil/dryness.</li>
            <li>Lucky for me, I checked it before using, and I checked it just 2 weeks after I bought it, not months after.</li>
            <li>In fact, it absorbs really quickly.</li>
            <li>can say, MANY years later, that I am still in love with this</li>
            <li>Got it quickly.</li>
            <li>Adequate moisturizer and sunblock.  </li>
            <li>It goes on very easily and spreads far so you don&#x27;t have to use a lot.  </li>
            <li>A little understood truth about beautiful skin is that it has a lot to do with the evenness of the skin&#x27;s color: not the amount of pigmentation, but the evenness of pigment distribution.</li>
            <li>I have tried a lot of other products and these are by far the best!!</li>
            <li>When I first applied the moisturizer, it was smooth on my face.</li>
            <li>The skin gets pretty smooth.</li>
            <li>Great moisturizer for dark skin</li>
            <li>I am a longtime, very satisfied consumer of Neutrogena skin products, and this is one of my daily favorites.</li>
            <li>Have used this product for years - ever since I started with uneven skin tone on my face, and it works beautifully.  </li>
            <li>and it actually smells pretty good.</li>
            <li>I like the Aveeno Daily Moisturizer spf 30 better!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>this is mild and great for everyday use.  </li>
            <li>I know it is not that quick but way better than the other products that says will remove marks/darkening etc.. and not do anything even after 6 months or more.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since I started using this moisturizer though, my skin is visibly clearer and much softer, and when I go a week without using it, I can literally see and feel a huge difference.</li>
            <li>So, when I initially started using this, it was amazing.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve noticed several amazing things improved on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My dermatologist always recommends Neutrogena products, and this has been my favorite so far.</li>
            <li>IT HAS A 30 SPF WHICH IS FAR BETTER THAN&lt;</li>
            <li>Without that, it&#x27;s hardly worth the price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s difficult to describe a smell, but I can tell you that it isn&#x27;t strong and the smell is actually very pleasant and soothing.</li>
            <li>both of these are wonderful products and will be my only ones of their type when I run out of the other stuff I have on hand.)</li>
            <li>didnt take, but thanks to the Most High, they</li>
            <li>I have combination skin and with the lotion it put the right amount of moisture on all areas of my face.  </li>
            <li>It made my right eye water.</li>
            <li>JUST THE RIGHT CONSISTENCY FOR APPLYING.&lt;br /&gt;PLUS</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s just call it right</li>
            <li>I break out so easily over new products.</li>
            <li>Overall pretty effective.</li>
            <li>I normally buy this locally, this was a good price at the time, so purchased online.</li>
            <li>My acne marks fade and its keeps my skin smooth and vibrant.</li>
            <li>I have tried much more expensive moisturizers, but this one is the best by far!</li>
            <li>This is very gentle, works well, and is worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Most people will like that it&#x27;s light and not &amp;#34;lotion-y,&amp;#34; but that also means it does virtually nothing for dry skin.</li>
            <li>It appears to making my face more supple, but I think I need to give it a little more time.</li>
            <li>I feel that Neutrogena&#x27;s Rapid Repair lotions moisturize much better and is worth the extra couple dollars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The second time, I experienced a burning sensation, along with several breakouts.!</li>
            <li>The SPF 30 is nice and that is the main appeal to me, so I&#x27;m on my 3rd tube.</li>
            <li>but my spots are pretty relentless.</li>
            <li>The first time i applied it, my face started stinging.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;ll be mostly oil instead of the white lotion.</li>
            <li>I actually found another product that works WAY BETTER.  </li>
            <li>It not only moisturises my face but also tones and evens out my skin that I wish I had found it sooner :)</li>
            <li>First of all, this has glitter in it, which I wasn&#x27;t expecting.</li>
            <li>I decided to give this a try since I recently moved to the beach and would be exposed to more sun.</li>
            <li>My skin is in pretty good shape because I have been using quality skin care products for years, but this cream did make noticeable improvements and it protects my skin from the harsh Arizona sun.</li>
            <li>still works like I said in my first review in Spring</li>
            <li>I decided to try this because I saw my sister for the first time in a couple of years.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t even tried it yet but fortunately for me, I did not try it on my sensitive face yet because they sold me an EXPIRED product.</li>
            <li>This product really works!</li>
            <li>Very flattering!</li>
            <li>Granted, genes help, but I also give credit to consistent, year in, year out use of Visibly Even.</li>
            <li>Actually, it may be my imagination but to me, my skin even looks better than before.</li>
            <li>go to your doctor,it really really really really really helps!</li>
            <li>, I tried to shake it again a lot more this time and then finally I got some well blended cream.</li>
            <li>I use Neutrogena Visible Even Daily, SPF30  moisturizer for many years, every day.</li>
            <li>Not buying again, but going back to Neutrogena Healthy skin.</li>
            <li>On hot and humid days, it gets into my eyes and stings.</li>
            <li>Neutrogena Visibly Even is the first moisturizer that I don&#x27;t experience breakouts with.</li>
            <li>But nope, I realize its the Neutrogena (although I am all those first things too ;-) )</li>
            <li>I used it sporadically, this time, since I now have a 8am-5pm corporate job (more like 6am-6:30pm)</li>
            <li>Despite all wonderful reviews about this moisturizer, it doesn&#x27;t work for me unfortunately.</li>
            <li>they would had I not purchased this product in the first place.</li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t and then stop using it for a while</li>
            <li>Plus I was 23 and realized that was more teenager stuff, so I searched for a more young adult (and underserved market; its usually teenage acne or anti-wrinkle creams) product.</li>
            <li>one day soon I will consistently only eat very clean...</li>
            <li>After using this for a week, My husband noticed and kept saying my skin looked clean and clear.  </li>
            <li>It is  not heavy, not clogging pores,smooth, no smell,  fast  absorbing, easy to use make up - foundation/concealer over it.</li>
            <li>personally will continue to use this in warmer months but switch to something more intensely moisturizing in the colder months.</li>
            <li>I love the cleanser also and definitely recommend you purchase the gentle cleanser alongside this moisturizer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love in San Diego and it is really sunny all of the time so SPF is needed daily.</li>
            <li>I was using Aveeno positively radiant</li>
            <li>I pretty much like all Neutrogena products.</li>
            <li>the prices are all jacked up and paying $20 for a daily moisturizer was becoming unbearable.  </li>
            <li>She first took a very close look at my face skin, and then without consulting my chart said \\&quot;you were born in 19xx, right?\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I was using Clean &amp; Clear products but they weren&#x27;t doing much for me.</li>
            <li>My skin is getting more sensitive with age, so I have to give up most of my regular moisturizers, especially with SPF ones.</li>
            <li>Makes my face feel better when it get really dry.</li>
            <li>finding that I need way less makeup, but to be honest</li>
            <li>I luv it, so creamy &amp; effective, gets me thru 18 holes of golfing, only a second application if it&#x27;s rea..lly hot or sweating profusely...</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li>The SPF amount is great for my everyday use under makeup with enough protection.</li>
            <li>It is great to wear everyday especially under makeup.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I shake the bottle before use every time but it still doesn&#x27;t help much.</li>
            <li>I wait until nothing is coming out but the cream to apply, but it leaves me very greasy.</li>
            <li>I trust Neutrogena not to break me out, and I really like their products.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it appears that the drug stores don&#x27;t carry it a much as they use to or its flying off the shelves.</li>
            <li>Within two days I could see my skin going back to the smooth glow</li>
            <li>No kidding--this stuff really works, and fast.</li>
            <li>I also believe it&#x27;s responsible for my skin tone evening and the texture smoothing out.</li>
            <li>Thank goodness for AMAZON because its much cheaper on here.</li>
            <li>I really like the texture of it.</li>
            <li>It moisturizes really well, but isn&#x27;t greasy at all.</li>
            <li>even- and in just two weeks I began to notice a real</li>
            <li>Even when shaken thoroughly it&#x27;s still really greasy.</li>
            <li>and I have very sensitive/acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>My skin is brighter and very even.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really notice any improvement at all in skin tone.</li>
            <li>Was very optimistic when I purchased this.  </li>
            <li>It is light enough to wear under makeup and it also give you the SPF30 you need.  </li>
            <li>This Neutrogena product works very well.</li>
            <li>it really works.</li>
            <li>It really does even out my skin tone.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really realize it was until one day</li>
            <li>I never used much to begin with anyway.</li>
            <li>and it leaves my skin feeling really moisturized.</li>
            <li>Important facts: I have only been using this for 2 weeks</li>
            <li>But I don&#x27;t use it that much</li>
            <li>After using it for two weeks and not seeing any difference in the tone of my skin, yesterday I switched back to my old moisturizer and noticed my skin looked much better-</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week straight, and it seems like a decent moisturizer with some good positive aspects, but a couple glaring negative ones.</li>
            <li>because the whether is hot because I live in the Caribbean.</li>
            <li>average American diet maybe-- try to eat healthy, but I&#x27;ll have the occasional fast food and extra chocolate chip cookies, lol.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really prone to breakouts with most the other products, even some Neutrogena moisturizers.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Recently It came back and I am SO excited.</li>
            <li>have rosacea, and before I had major signs of it, this would calm the redness and</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really work super quickly or that noticeably on dark spots.</li>
            <li>My dark spots were gone within one week and my skin is more of a even tone.</li>
            <li>I am a young student with skin that is super oily in the summer, and super dry during the winter.</li>
            <li>Even when I go to beauty departments, the makeup artists always go one about how little foundation I need because I have such good skin.</li>
            <li>Love the other neutrogena products, but this one really irritates my eyes even if I don&#x27;t put near my eyes  </li>
            <li>Within a week, I noticed my skin was visibly more even, and my acne scars were slightly duller.</li>
            <li>I wear foundation less because my face looks so healthy.</li>
            <li>This is certainly a 5 star product in my book, after searching for the right products I&#x27;ve finally found a line that would work just for me.  </li>
            <li>It has extra moisturizing agents (more so than the regular Nuetrogena oil-free mousturizer)</li>
            <li>I use it mainly for sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth, starting to clear and even out my skin tone.</li>
            <li>soy in this product, a natural skin brightener, works to smooth and soften the skin while the SPF protects your skin from further sun damage.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say much about the reduction in discoloration yet, I&#x27;ll add more on that in a few weeks.</li>
            <li>It very moisturizing on my face though and leaves my face feeling very soft after application.</li>
            <li>Women, highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>, I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>would highly recommend this product...</li>
            <li>I find that it makes me sweat a little more</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s almost completely vanished!!</li>
            <li>a little more makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have a sensitive skin but this one is very mild and gentle on the face.. not oily and dries faster than other moisturizers</li>
            <li>I bought it during the winter, so I haven&#x27;t really had a chance to use it in direct sunlight, but I like the way it feels.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Firstly, when I opened it from the box, it felt so light as though the tube is empty.</li>
            <li>I used it for about 3 weeks straight and noticed I was getting a lot more pimples than usual.</li>
            <li>Now I feel extra fresh in the morning</li>
            <li>Within a few weeks, my skin was looking better then I can ever remember.</li>
            <li>skin combination type of skin doesn&#x27;t normally break out nor have allergy reaction to skincare products.</li>
            <li>I love this moisturizer because it is lightweight for my skin type yet moisturizing enough so my skin doesn&#x27;t feel dry</li>
            <li>and Im still waiting for all these new blemishes to go away.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It lasts me months before I have to buy a new bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this on Amazon because it isn&#x27;t offered where I live.  </li>
            <li>Live and learn.</li>
            <li>But my wallet groaned every time I had to buy a new tube, so after reading reviews, I decided to try this.</li>
            <li>I am 59 years old and have tried many products through the years for uneven skin tone.</li>
            <li>This is the only neutrogena moisturizer that is light weight enough to wear under your foundation!!!</li>
            <li>It left my face really shiny and didn&#x27;t really moisturize all that well.</li>
            <li>It makes it messy to apply, and is generally kind of gross to look at, since it&#x27;s almost like an oily consistency.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and every lotion I have&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see any huge or immediate difference on skin&#x27;s dark spots or &amp;#34;uneveness&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately it is not the same quality it had.</li>
            <li>, this is not a reason for my low grade, but if you&#x27;re aware that you have a soy allergy, take note that this contains soy.</li>
            <li>First off, I am a female but this review shows up under my husband&#x27;s name.  </li>
            <li>It obviously contains no horrid fumes that make my eyes feel dry/irritated as do so many other products (even the unscented ones).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So it took me by surprise that at my first application of the product, red spots with itchy and burning sensation occurred.</li>
            <li>Seriously, within just a few minutes my skin feels great to the touch, and has a much healthier look -</li>
            <li>I think for skin tone the Aveeno positively radiant scrub has made a MUCH bigger difference.</li>
            <li>I want the old, clear moisturizer/sunscreen!</li>
            <li>It can make skin soft and clear and radiance to beauty!</li>
            <li>Used consistently over a period of at least several months, Visibly Even does what the name implies; it makes the skin&#x27;s color appear to be more even.</li>
            <li>I have combination skin (classic T-zone: oily forehead, nose, and chin and dry cheeks) and used to have dark spots and patches, mostly on my chin and cheeks.  </li>
            <li>My skin isn&#x27;t as clear or as soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product clearly works well for a lot of people.</li>
            <li>As soon as I tried to squeeze the cream out, some clear oily liquid oozed out.</li>
            <li>It has a smooth, velvety texture that keeps my T-zone under control and serves as a good base for my make-up.  </li>
            <li>but I developed a reaction to the sunscreen in it.  </li>
            <li>Please do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>Makes skin feel so soft and have noticed sun spots getting lighter.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a guy and 20 years old.</li>
            <li>: My skin feels much much smoother on the outside.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>My skin is too sensitive for this product.</li>
            <li>I have not noticed any key changes in my complexion, but I think that this moisturizer is very lightweight and feels like silk on my skin.</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly and isn&#x27;t heavy.  </li>
            <li>I have only used this for about 2 weeks straight now so may be too soon to notice.  </li>
            <li>- i am 28 now - it is still the same high quality moisturizer ever !</li>
            <li>I am 35 years old and have been using this product for about 3 weeks.  </li>
            <li>Admittedly, my nose is overly sensitive to smell-will give this away.</li>
            <li>have *extremely* sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Just a word of warning to those of you with sensitive skin - this might not be the product for you.</li>
            <li>So far, I do like it and would recommend it to anyone wanting a smoother and glowing complexion.</li>
            <li>Absorbs completely.</li>
            <li>I now mix it with my Cerave moisturizer to get the SPF benefits and not waste my money.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a base sunscreen layer under makeup, this is great, though!</li>
            <li>This product is excellent sunscreen and makeup base.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re applying during hot weather, allow it to dry completely and pat the moisture with a tissue before you apply makeup.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s always pretty dry.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine for me in the summer, but in winter, I will need something more heavy duty for that dull winter skin!</li>
            <li>I use in the morning for an instant glow (when applied with my usual makeup) providing the healthy looking glow that my skin was lacking.</li>
            <li>I ordered the Neutrogena Visibly Even Daily Moisturizer with SPF Sunscreen for two main reasons.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t recommend high enough!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it, especially for women of color life myself.</li>
            <li>I spent so much on this product!</li>
            <li>I live the SPF 30 factor and it fades the occasional blemish marks on my face.</li>
            <li>That way I can use all I needand not feel like I constantly need to spend money on a new tube.</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out or anything and does add some moisture, but I wouldn&#x27;t really call it a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>That last point is the deal-breaker for me, and I think I am just going to suck it up and go back to paying three times as much for a moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t have these deficiencies.</li>
            <li>In fact, my skin feels soft and even after putting it on and it actually is fading some old acne scars I&#x27;ve had since I was a teenager.</li>
            <li>This time some more oily liquid came out before the white thick moisturizer.</li>
            <li>(note for you jogging knuckleheads in upper USA: your facial skin will have micro-tears in winter if you run into the wind - if you find your face peeling during winter, and I know this sounds icky, stop using facial wash of any kind for 36 - 48 hrs...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if this has actually lightened them or that I am just hoping that it has, but I do feel that my skin has a more overall even tone, and looks brighter which is great because I had been feeling like my complexion had become a bit dull for at least this last year now.</li>
            <li>I am 31 years old and have started getting dark spots on my face, sort of like large freckles, which I hear people call age or sun spots.</li>
            <li>but by the end of the first week i had broken out completely!!!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d definitely recommend this for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I am 66 years old, and my skin tone definitely improved while using this product.</li>
            <li>But because of this, I barely wear make up during the summer months.</li>
            <li>: I&#x27;ve never really done much, growing up</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m African American, so finding a good moisturizer for my skin tone has been difficult.</li>
            <li>I have naturally oily skin and large pores, and I do feel that my skin has been looking less shiny and clearer since using this.</li>
            <li>After using this lotion a few times, I found that my cheeks hurt so much that I would wash off the lotion and to cool my face down would put on the nighttime version.</li>
            <li>After one use of both the facial wash and the lotion my skin was smoother, softer, lighter, more even, and less dark spots.  </li>
            <li>For men with sensitive skin, you really cannot beat Visibly Even, especially for the price; and I&#x27;ve used Menscience, Anthony Logistics, Murad, and a host of other products from the MASC Skincare site.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little thicker than what I expected, but it&#x27;s fine because it goes on well.  </li>
            <li>Moisturizes normal to dry skin.</li>
            <li>During the wintertime when my skin is extremely dry, I use the Lumene Dry Skin Radiance Cocktail first and then this, and the dryness is gone all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really notice a difference other than the moisture.</li>
            <li>I thought I would try this out because I do have an uneven skin tone and so far, I really like it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve spent sooooo much money only skin</li>
            <li>I am a 22 year old African American girl  </li>
            <li>For 2 years prior to using this moisturizer, I had been using a very nice (and very expensive) daily moisturizer from Sephora.</li>
            <li>I did break out a little when I first started using it, but since then haven&#x27;t had any issues.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little heavy/greasy and a little does not go a long way, so mainly in the summer, I mix it with a light moisturizer (aside from this I use Clinique).</li>
            <li>I used this for my skin as opposed to my face for some skin discolorations and it made my skin smooth and began to make the dark spots less noticeable.</li>
            <li>and it really does lighten some of the dark spots on my face.</li>
            <li>I saw a dermatologist not long ago.</li>
            <li>(still not sure if that was the right choice).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just kept on with the half fast job for months up until tonight when I finished the bottle.</li>
            <li>(I have some light scarring from acne, and a few dark spots from the sun).</li>
            <li>I recently went on a complete revamping of my (limitedly stocked, admittedly) makeup drawer.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer would actually burn my skin a little in certain places, specifically the apples of my cheeks.  </li>
            <li>I have olive, oily skin but am now old enough where teenage &amp;#34;acne&amp;#34; treatments dry my skin out too much....yet somehow still get acne...</li>
            <li>I use it every morning with a little blush and lipstick and I&#x27;m ready to go.</li>
            <li>Have not heard in bad news, so I&#x27;ll assume that&#x27;s a good thing...</li>

            <li> I am 33 and loving it!</li>
            <li> I am confident that it is the best for under $15, though!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love all Neutrogena products, they are great!</li>
            <li> Good buy, doesnt &amp;#34;tint&amp;#34; your face but makes it appear more flawless and shrinks the look of pores.</li>
            <li> This is amazing reduces brown spots and blemishes and great texture that does not clog the pores</li>
            <li> Not too good for summer time because it sweats off since it isnt water resistant.</li>
            <li> Smells good, feels good</li>
            <li> I am a fair skin women in my 50 &#x27; s</li>
            <li> This is a really good investment.</li>
            <li> I kept hearing good things about this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> The smell does tend to fade away as the day goes on though, so that&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> This was a good price, I like moisturizers with SPF in them.</li>
            <li> Read the good reviews of Neutrogena Visibly Even and decided to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> So, I searched around on the good ol&#x27; internets for awhile and decided to switch my foundation and moisturizer to Neutrogena products, as they seemed to be favorably</li>
            <li> good luck.&lt;br</li>
            <li> which—like all good products—seems to have been discontinued.</li>
            <li> So light and smells great!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about the &amp;#34;evening&amp;#34; effects, but my skin looks and feels good.</li>
            <li> This stuff is good.</li>
            <li> I was excited when I found this moisturizer with great reviews with great price.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the texture, smell and how it really is a great sunblock under makeup,</li>
            <li> it okay great moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This product met my expectations and I am very pleased with the feeling it leaves on my skin.  </li>
            <li> It is not oily and disappears into my skin leaving a nice feel and good foundation for my makeup.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t recommend this more!</li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> My doctor recommended SPF 30 or higher for my face and this has worked perfectly.</li>
            <li> love it!</li>
            <li> My face looks better now than it did 10 years ago!</li>
            <li> If it could stop breaking me out, I&#x27;d love it!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this moisturizer!</li>
            <li> would love to see it!</li>
            <li> In addition to drinking more water this product has cleared my skin drastically!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer!</li>
            <li> Excellent results exactly what I needed</li>
            <li> I love Neutrogena products!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied with this one!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a better moisturizer in my life!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this moisturizer!</li>
            <li> LOVE this Neutrogena product!</li>
            <li> I thought it would be a bit more pleasant on the face</li>
            <li> I have to say that this is an amazing product.  </li>
            <li> Thank you Neutrogena for making amazing products.</li>
            <li> It evens my skin tone and brightens it gives it an amazing glow.</li>
            <li> just a side not, you are not going to get an amazing face by just using drugstore/any cleanser.</li>
            <li> have NOTHING but amazing things to say about this product.</li>
            <li> The reason for the four stars is that it&#x27;s not quite as moisturizing as I would have liked.</li>
            <li> still waiting but definitly nice as moisturizer.</li>
            <li> after trying another kind</li>
            <li> so it is perfect for summer time when heavier lotions can be too much.</li>
            <li> I wear it on work days under beauty balm in the summer, and on it&#x27;s own on the weekends.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely thrilled to see this</li>
            <li> I apply it each morning and honestly could not be happier with the results.</li>
            <li> It smells nice and is not greasy.</li>
            <li> It goes on nicely and does not irritate my skin.  </li>
            <li> Nice moisturizer with&lt;br /&gt;30 SPF.  </li>
            <li> Feels nice.</li>
            <li> Nice and cushy at first, but then after about a week or so of using it it gets watery?</li>
            <li> This is the first neutrogena product I bought after reading to the many awesome neutrogena reviews everywhere.</li>
            <li> This product is very easy to apply, does what it says it can do and is a keeper.</li>
            <li> so it wont come off with sweat, absorbs very easily</li>
            <li> I love this product, together with the night antiwrinkle cream, you may not be able to guess my age!</li>
            <li> Gives the appearance of a flawless natural glow</li>
            <li> Give it a shot, it&#x27;s by far the best skin care product I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> Mild, pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> Gotta honor our temples right, lol :-)</li>
            <li> It is like a very light makeup that contains sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> It goes on very light, and does it&#x27;s job.  </li>
            <li> Very light texture</li>
            <li> Good price and quick delivery.</li>
            <li> This one is not greasy at all, goes on nicely and absorbs very quickly.</li>
            <li> The best part is that it actually works!</li>
            <li> i love it but still did not see results in terms of fading my acne scar.</li>
            <li> This was the one product that worked perfectly for clearing up red, blotchy skin and evening-out skin tone.</li>
            <li> I also didn&#x27;t notice any more \\&quot;evenness\\&quot; in my complexion at all....</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed this product.  </li>
            <li> I will buy more when I run out.</li>
            <li> Mostly Monday through Friday and even though I don&#x27;t think it works for fading spots.</li>
            <li> I use these the most for care of my skin.</li>
            <li> me say that this is definitely more of a sunscreen than a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t ever have to buy a better moisturizer ever since I found about this.</li>
            <li> I still love the product and will return to it after the heat starts to drop.</li>
            <li> However, I still love this product.  </li>
            <li> love this moisturizer...</li>
            <li> I did love the fact it was SPF 50 though.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t help either, but I use  Ben Nye Luxury Powder on top and the shine is gone.&lt;br /&gt;#3.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice as a moisturizer and light sunscreen, but it&#x27;s a tad bit on the oily side.</li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> It says so on the box, but might as well mention it to be safe.)</li>
            <li> It is not greasy and one thing I really love about it is that it is almost like a primer for my makeup.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed my powder goes better and seems to cover my imperfections better.</li>
            <li> Love it and works well.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t want any more.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> overall the best moisturizer i have used.the spf is also a plus!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this product and order it time and time again.</li>
            <li> I uasually love Neutrogena products.  </li>
            <li> i love it</li>
            <li> Love this moisturizer!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many lotions, serums, scrubs, masks...even green-light therapy...with no results.  </li>
            <li> and i love Neutrogena.</li>
            <li> (your pimples):)</li>
            <li> Love it, will continue to use</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I use Neutrogena sun tan lotion, and love it.  </li>
            <li> This product felt oily on my skin and caused more breakouts and redness than I had before using it.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure the SPF doesn&#x27;t hurt, but</li>
            <li> There are better products on the market than this one.</li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> :).</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer..</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s better than anything I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get any better than this.</li>
            <li> I really love this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I am on my 4th or 5th bottle! :)</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> we&#x27;re fertile and ready, lol.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll put on some more moisturizer and</li>
            <li> but I like this much better.</li>
            <li> so I end up using a lot more of this product than I thought I&#x27;d need.</li>
            <li> I mostly like Neutrogena brand items.</li>
            <li> I have been using it on and off since purchase date, mostly on</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just an okay product..</li>
            <li> Was hoping it would have been better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m working on eating very clean.</li>
            <li> I think for great skin, if you have normal skin like me, then this stuff + lots of water will have you \\&quot;glowing\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I have pretty good skin and didn&#x27;t used to use a moisturizer or even a cleanser beforehand, so be forewarned that my review may be biased in that</li>
            <li> Loved it the first time because it went on evenly (no streaking), was 30 spf, and I did not develop any sensitivity.</li>
            <li> Not the best product I&#x27;ve ever used by a long shot.</li>
            <li> Bio Oil is also pretty good for that.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer really does a good job no stickiness and no fragrance except a very clean aroma.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years as my primary moisturizer, and I love it.</li>
            <li> My skin has this great soft, smooth feeling and visible</li>
            <li> Unlike others I&#x27;ve used, makeup goes on afterward evenly and easily.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and invisible.  </li>
            <li> I am your classic fair and freckled person, so I need sunblock (whether in lotion or clothing form) all the time.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, you would find this to be a good moisturizer, and the price is much better than the moisturizer with sunscreen sold by brand name makeup companies.  </li>
            <li> but I have to be honest and say any effect this had on my skin tone came and went within the first 2 weeks of using it.</li>
            <li> My skin looks vibrant and has a nice healthy glow.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and light and can easily be used underneath makeup without causing any oiliness.</li>
            <li> When it&#x27;s cooler I&#x27;ll play around a bit with the foundation (for foundation and the BB, I have found that Maybelline&#x27;s dreamwhip foundation and their beauty balm work just fine - they aren&#x27;t greasy at all and sit lightly on my skin</li>
            <li> It makes my face very smooth, soft, and it definitely feels great!  </li>
            <li> The best sunscreen hands down!</li>
            <li> Keeps this 58 year old face looking bright and smooth.</li>
            <li> is the only moisturizer I have ever used, but I am really happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product goes on lightly</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel really smooth.</li>
            <li> Makeup did not go on smoothly over this.</li>
            <li> The SPF 30 is also great-the cream goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t make your face look too greasy or shiny.</li>
            <li> I do not wear makeup, so even skin tone is important to me.  </li>
            <li> I gave it four stars because there might just be something more powerful out there, and I have been led to keep looking.</li>
            <li> Light weight feel with 30spf to protect my face every day.</li>
            <li> use this every day straight for eight weeks, and your supposed to have amazing skin.</li>
            <li> The product I received wasn&#x27;t light and felt greasy.</li>
            <li> It made my skin look porcelain smooth (before...</li>
            <li> I wanted to try and smooth over some of my hyperpigmentation and acne scars with this</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and doesn&#x27;t have that SPF scent.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone looking for a light moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> All my family has smooth skin though (and we all just used Noxema).</li>
            <li> It was great as a regular moisturizer, but did not even my skin tone at all.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;tried has caused either a breakout or irritation, but so far so good.  </li>
            <li> But the fact that the skin gets so soft is already a good thing.</li>
            <li> I turned my light on, just so I can make sure I saw everything right</li>
            <li> very nice daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li> However, the light moisturizer leaves your skin feeling clean and your pores unclogged</li>
            <li> This has caused more scarring for me than I had previously and it&#x27;s not that great of a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Works the first time better than this</li>
            <li> I was pleased with the results the first time, that I decided to use it again.  </li>
            <li> I guess that&#x27;s a plus  Original Review:</li>
            <li> It is nice and lightweight and moisturizes perfectly, but every time i use it it comes out weird for awhile.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used  visibly even for many years,  my 20 year old daughter love it too....</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly, and absorbs quickly (as opposed to the Oil of Olay which seemed to take forever to absorb).</li>
            <li> It goes on easily and is quickly absorbed.</li>
            <li> I have to say that I like it better than the Aveeno positively radiant moisturizer, which did not even out my skin tone at all.</li>
            <li> Overall, I would definitely recommend this for anyone looking for a good moisturizer-your skin will look amazing!</li>
            <li> The great thing about this Neutrogena product is that it has SPF 30, and it soaks into my slightly oily skin (and leaves it smelling nice and feeling very soft)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Very nice, haven&#x27;t used long enough to make good review</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t looking for a deep wrinkle remover, just something to make my skin bright and</li>
            <li> the visibly even helps my skin the best because it really eliminates dark spots over time.  </li>
            <li> Smells good, which is definitely a plus.  </li>
            <li> I use the Neutrogena nighttime moisturizer and loved, and thought this would have been a similar experience.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to find anything that hydrates like this since my rosacea became much worse.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but I know it works because my skin feels much softer and better.</li>
            <li> Love it for the protection but the smell is so off putting and smells too much like sunscreen.</li>
            <li> However, the smell is pleasant and does not linger for long.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really amazing and does much more than I expected.</li>
            <li> However, I do want to stress that this hasn&#x27;t solved my mild acne on my lower cheeks where I&#x27;ve never had a problem with oil/dryness.</li>
            <li> Lucky for me, I checked it before using, and I checked it just 2 weeks after I bought it, not months after.</li>
            <li> In fact, it absorbs really quickly.</li>
            <li> can say, MANY years later, that I am still in love with this</li>
            <li> Got it quickly.</li>
            <li> Adequate moisturizer and sunblock.  </li>
            <li> It goes on very easily and spreads far so you don&#x27;t have to use a lot.  </li>
            <li> A little understood truth about beautiful skin is that it has a lot to do with the evenness of the skin&#x27;s color: not the amount of pigmentation, but the evenness of pigment distribution.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of other products and these are by far the best!!</li>
            <li> When I first applied the moisturizer, it was smooth on my face.</li>
            <li> The skin gets pretty smooth.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer for dark skin</li>
            <li> I am a longtime, very satisfied consumer of Neutrogena skin products, and this is one of my daily favorites.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for years - ever since I started with uneven skin tone on my face, and it works beautifully.  </li>
            <li> and it actually smells pretty good.</li>
            <li> I like the Aveeno Daily Moisturizer spf 30 better!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> this is mild and great for everyday use.  </li>
            <li> I know it is not that quick but way better than the other products that says will remove marks/darkening etc.. and not do anything even after 6 months or more.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I started using this moisturizer though, my skin is visibly clearer and much softer, and when I go a week without using it, I can literally see and feel a huge difference.</li>
            <li> So, when I initially started using this, it was amazing.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve noticed several amazing things improved on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My dermatologist always recommends Neutrogena products, and this has been my favorite so far.</li>
            <li> IT HAS A 30 SPF WHICH IS FAR BETTER THAN&lt;</li>
            <li> Without that, it&#x27;s hardly worth the price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to describe a smell, but I can tell you that it isn&#x27;t strong and the smell is actually very pleasant and soothing.</li>
            <li> both of these are wonderful products and will be my only ones of their type when I run out of the other stuff I have on hand.)</li>
            <li> didnt take, but thanks to the Most High, they</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and with the lotion it put the right amount of moisture on all areas of my face.  </li>
            <li> It made my right eye water.</li>
            <li> JUST THE RIGHT CONSISTENCY FOR APPLYING.&lt;br /&gt;PLUS</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s just call it right</li>
            <li> I break out so easily over new products.</li>
            <li> Overall pretty effective.</li>
            <li> I normally buy this locally, this was a good price at the time, so purchased online.</li>
            <li> My acne marks fade and its keeps my skin smooth and vibrant.</li>
            <li> I have tried much more expensive moisturizers, but this one is the best by far!</li>
            <li> This is very gentle, works well, and is worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Most people will like that it&#x27;s light and not &amp;#34;lotion-y,&amp;#34; but that also means it does virtually nothing for dry skin.</li>
            <li> It appears to making my face more supple, but I think I need to give it a little more time.</li>
            <li> I feel that Neutrogena&#x27;s Rapid Repair lotions moisturize much better and is worth the extra couple dollars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The second time, I experienced a burning sensation, along with several breakouts.!</li>
            <li> The SPF 30 is nice and that is the main appeal to me, so I&#x27;m on my 3rd tube.</li>
            <li> but my spots are pretty relentless.</li>
            <li> The first time i applied it, my face started stinging.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;ll be mostly oil instead of the white lotion.</li>
            <li> I actually found another product that works WAY BETTER.  </li>
            <li> It not only moisturises my face but also tones and evens out my skin that I wish I had found it sooner :)</li>
            <li> First of all, this has glitter in it, which I wasn&#x27;t expecting.</li>
            <li> I decided to give this a try since I recently moved to the beach and would be exposed to more sun.</li>
            <li> My skin is in pretty good shape because I have been using quality skin care products for years, but this cream did make noticeable improvements and it protects my skin from the harsh Arizona sun.</li>
            <li> still works like I said in my first review in Spring</li>
            <li> I decided to try this because I saw my sister for the first time in a couple of years.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t even tried it yet but fortunately for me, I did not try it on my sensitive face yet because they sold me an EXPIRED product.</li>
            <li> This product really works!</li>
            <li> Very flattering!</li>
            <li> Granted, genes help, but I also give credit to consistent, year in, year out use of Visibly Even.</li>
            <li> Actually, it may be my imagination but to me, my skin even looks better than before.</li>
            <li> go to your doctor,it really really really really really helps!</li>
            <li> , I tried to shake it again a lot more this time and then finally I got some well blended cream.</li>
            <li> I use Neutrogena Visible Even Daily, SPF30  moisturizer for many years, every day.</li>
            <li> Not buying again, but going back to Neutrogena Healthy skin.</li>
            <li> On hot and humid days, it gets into my eyes and stings.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena Visibly Even is the first moisturizer that I don&#x27;t experience breakouts with.</li>
            <li> But nope, I realize its the Neutrogena (although I am all those first things too ;-) )</li>
            <li> I used it sporadically, this time, since I now have a 8am-5pm corporate job (more like 6am-6:30pm)</li>
            <li> Despite all wonderful reviews about this moisturizer, it doesn&#x27;t work for me unfortunately.</li>
            <li> they would had I not purchased this product in the first place.</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t and then stop using it for a while</li>
            <li> Plus I was 23 and realized that was more teenager stuff, so I searched for a more young adult (and underserved market; its usually teenage acne or anti-wrinkle creams) product.</li>
            <li> one day soon I will consistently only eat very clean...</li>
            <li> After using this for a week, My husband noticed and kept saying my skin looked clean and clear.  </li>
            <li> It is  not heavy, not clogging pores,smooth, no smell,  fast  absorbing, easy to use make up - foundation/concealer over it.</li>
            <li> personally will continue to use this in warmer months but switch to something more intensely moisturizing in the colder months.</li>
            <li> I love the cleanser also and definitely recommend you purchase the gentle cleanser alongside this moisturizer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love in San Diego and it is really sunny all of the time so SPF is needed daily.</li>
            <li> I was using Aveeno positively radiant</li>
            <li> I pretty much like all Neutrogena products.</li>
            <li> the prices are all jacked up and paying $20 for a daily moisturizer was becoming unbearable.  </li>
            <li> She first took a very close look at my face skin, and then without consulting my chart said \\&quot;you were born in 19xx, right?\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I was using Clean &amp; Clear products but they weren&#x27;t doing much for me.</li>
            <li> My skin is getting more sensitive with age, so I have to give up most of my regular moisturizers, especially with SPF ones.</li>
            <li> Makes my face feel better when it get really dry.</li>
            <li> finding that I need way less makeup, but to be honest</li>
            <li> I luv it, so creamy &amp; effective, gets me thru 18 holes of golfing, only a second application if it&#x27;s rea..lly hot or sweating profusely...</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li> The SPF amount is great for my everyday use under makeup with enough protection.</li>
            <li> It is great to wear everyday especially under makeup.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I shake the bottle before use every time but it still doesn&#x27;t help much.</li>
            <li> I wait until nothing is coming out but the cream to apply, but it leaves me very greasy.</li>
            <li> I trust Neutrogena not to break me out, and I really like their products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it appears that the drug stores don&#x27;t carry it a much as they use to or its flying off the shelves.</li>
            <li> Within two days I could see my skin going back to the smooth glow</li>
            <li> No kidding--this stuff really works, and fast.</li>
            <li> I also believe it&#x27;s responsible for my skin tone evening and the texture smoothing out.</li>
            <li> Thank goodness for AMAZON because its much cheaper on here.</li>
            <li> I really like the texture of it.</li>
            <li> It moisturizes really well, but isn&#x27;t greasy at all.</li>
            <li> even- and in just two weeks I began to notice a real</li>
            <li> Even when shaken thoroughly it&#x27;s still really greasy.</li>
            <li> and I have very sensitive/acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> My skin is brighter and very even.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really notice any improvement at all in skin tone.</li>
            <li> Was very optimistic when I purchased this.  </li>
            <li> It is light enough to wear under makeup and it also give you the SPF30 you need.  </li>
            <li> This Neutrogena product works very well.</li>
            <li> it really works.</li>
            <li> It really does even out my skin tone.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really realize it was until one day</li>
            <li> I never used much to begin with anyway.</li>
            <li> and it leaves my skin feeling really moisturized.</li>
            <li> Important facts: I have only been using this for 2 weeks</li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t use it that much</li>
            <li> After using it for two weeks and not seeing any difference in the tone of my skin, yesterday I switched back to my old moisturizer and noticed my skin looked much better-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week straight, and it seems like a decent moisturizer with some good positive aspects, but a couple glaring negative ones.</li>
            <li> because the whether is hot because I live in the Caribbean.</li>
            <li> average American diet maybe-- try to eat healthy, but I&#x27;ll have the occasional fast food and extra chocolate chip cookies, lol.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really prone to breakouts with most the other products, even some Neutrogena moisturizers.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Recently It came back and I am SO excited.</li>
            <li> have rosacea, and before I had major signs of it, this would calm the redness and</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really work super quickly or that noticeably on dark spots.</li>
            <li> My dark spots were gone within one week and my skin is more of a even tone.</li>
            <li> I am a young student with skin that is super oily in the summer, and super dry during the winter.</li>
            <li> Even when I go to beauty departments, the makeup artists always go one about how little foundation I need because I have such good skin.</li>
            <li> Love the other neutrogena products, but this one really irritates my eyes even if I don&#x27;t put near my eyes  </li>
            <li> Within a week, I noticed my skin was visibly more even, and my acne scars were slightly duller.</li>
            <li> I wear foundation less because my face looks so healthy.</li>
            <li> This is certainly a 5 star product in my book, after searching for the right products I&#x27;ve finally found a line that would work just for me.  </li>
            <li> It has extra moisturizing agents (more so than the regular Nuetrogena oil-free mousturizer)</li>
            <li> I use it mainly for sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smooth, starting to clear and even out my skin tone.</li>
            <li> soy in this product, a natural skin brightener, works to smooth and soften the skin while the SPF protects your skin from further sun damage.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say much about the reduction in discoloration yet, I&#x27;ll add more on that in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> It very moisturizing on my face though and leaves my face feeling very soft after application.</li>
            <li> Women, highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> , I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> would highly recommend this product...</li>
            <li> I find that it makes me sweat a little more</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s almost completely vanished!!</li>
            <li> a little more makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have a sensitive skin but this one is very mild and gentle on the face.. not oily and dries faster than other moisturizers</li>
            <li> I bought it during the winter, so I haven&#x27;t really had a chance to use it in direct sunlight, but I like the way it feels.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Firstly, when I opened it from the box, it felt so light as though the tube is empty.</li>
            <li> I used it for about 3 weeks straight and noticed I was getting a lot more pimples than usual.</li>
            <li> Now I feel extra fresh in the morning</li>
            <li> Within a few weeks, my skin was looking better then I can ever remember.</li>
            <li> skin combination type of skin doesn&#x27;t normally break out nor have allergy reaction to skincare products.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer because it is lightweight for my skin type yet moisturizing enough so my skin doesn&#x27;t feel dry</li>
            <li> and Im still waiting for all these new blemishes to go away.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It lasts me months before I have to buy a new bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this on Amazon because it isn&#x27;t offered where I live.  </li>
            <li> Live and learn.</li>
            <li> But my wallet groaned every time I had to buy a new tube, so after reading reviews, I decided to try this.</li>
            <li> I am 59 years old and have tried many products through the years for uneven skin tone.</li>
            <li> This is the only neutrogena moisturizer that is light weight enough to wear under your foundation!!!</li>
            <li> It left my face really shiny and didn&#x27;t really moisturize all that well.</li>
            <li> It makes it messy to apply, and is generally kind of gross to look at, since it&#x27;s almost like an oily consistency.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and every lotion I have&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any huge or immediate difference on skin&#x27;s dark spots or &amp;#34;uneveness&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately it is not the same quality it had.</li>
            <li> , this is not a reason for my low grade, but if you&#x27;re aware that you have a soy allergy, take note that this contains soy.</li>
            <li> First off, I am a female but this review shows up under my husband&#x27;s name.  </li>
            <li> It obviously contains no horrid fumes that make my eyes feel dry/irritated as do so many other products (even the unscented ones).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So it took me by surprise that at my first application of the product, red spots with itchy and burning sensation occurred.</li>
            <li> Seriously, within just a few minutes my skin feels great to the touch, and has a much healthier look -</li>
            <li> I think for skin tone the Aveeno positively radiant scrub has made a MUCH bigger difference.</li>
            <li> I want the old, clear moisturizer/sunscreen!</li>
            <li> It can make skin soft and clear and radiance to beauty!</li>
            <li> Used consistently over a period of at least several months, Visibly Even does what the name implies; it makes the skin&#x27;s color appear to be more even.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin (classic T-zone: oily forehead, nose, and chin and dry cheeks) and used to have dark spots and patches, mostly on my chin and cheeks.  </li>
            <li> My skin isn&#x27;t as clear or as soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product clearly works well for a lot of people.</li>
            <li> As soon as I tried to squeeze the cream out, some clear oily liquid oozed out.</li>
            <li> It has a smooth, velvety texture that keeps my T-zone under control and serves as a good base for my make-up.  </li>
            <li> but I developed a reaction to the sunscreen in it.  </li>
            <li> Please do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> Makes skin feel so soft and have noticed sun spots getting lighter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy and 20 years old.</li>
            <li> : My skin feels much much smoother on the outside.</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> My skin is too sensitive for this product.</li>
            <li> I have not noticed any key changes in my complexion, but I think that this moisturizer is very lightweight and feels like silk on my skin.</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly and isn&#x27;t heavy.  </li>
            <li> I have only used this for about 2 weeks straight now so may be too soon to notice.  </li>
            <li> - i am 28 now - it is still the same high quality moisturizer ever !</li>
            <li> I am 35 years old and have been using this product for about 3 weeks.  </li>
            <li> Admittedly, my nose is overly sensitive to smell-will give this away.</li>
            <li> have *extremely* sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Just a word of warning to those of you with sensitive skin - this might not be the product for you.</li>
            <li> So far, I do like it and would recommend it to anyone wanting a smoother and glowing complexion.</li>
            <li> Absorbs completely.</li>
            <li> I now mix it with my Cerave moisturizer to get the SPF benefits and not waste my money.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a base sunscreen layer under makeup, this is great, though!</li>
            <li> This product is excellent sunscreen and makeup base.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re applying during hot weather, allow it to dry completely and pat the moisture with a tissue before you apply makeup.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s always pretty dry.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine for me in the summer, but in winter, I will need something more heavy duty for that dull winter skin!</li>
            <li> I use in the morning for an instant glow (when applied with my usual makeup) providing the healthy looking glow that my skin was lacking.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Neutrogena Visibly Even Daily Moisturizer with SPF Sunscreen for two main reasons.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t recommend high enough!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it, especially for women of color life myself.</li>
            <li> I spent so much on this product!</li>
            <li> I live the SPF 30 factor and it fades the occasional blemish marks on my face.</li>
            <li> That way I can use all I needand not feel like I constantly need to spend money on a new tube.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out or anything and does add some moisture, but I wouldn&#x27;t really call it a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> That last point is the deal-breaker for me, and I think I am just going to suck it up and go back to paying three times as much for a moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t have these deficiencies.</li>
            <li> In fact, my skin feels soft and even after putting it on and it actually is fading some old acne scars I&#x27;ve had since I was a teenager.</li>
            <li> This time some more oily liquid came out before the white thick moisturizer.</li>
            <li> (note for you jogging knuckleheads in upper USA: your facial skin will have micro-tears in winter if you run into the wind - if you find your face peeling during winter, and I know this sounds icky, stop using facial wash of any kind for 36 - 48 hrs...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this has actually lightened them or that I am just hoping that it has, but I do feel that my skin has a more overall even tone, and looks brighter which is great because I had been feeling like my complexion had become a bit dull for at least this last year now.</li>
            <li> I am 31 years old and have started getting dark spots on my face, sort of like large freckles, which I hear people call age or sun spots.</li>
            <li> but by the end of the first week i had broken out completely!!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d definitely recommend this for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I am 66 years old, and my skin tone definitely improved while using this product.</li>
            <li> But because of this, I barely wear make up during the summer months.</li>
            <li> : I&#x27;ve never really done much, growing up</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m African American, so finding a good moisturizer for my skin tone has been difficult.</li>
            <li> I have naturally oily skin and large pores, and I do feel that my skin has been looking less shiny and clearer since using this.</li>
            <li> After using this lotion a few times, I found that my cheeks hurt so much that I would wash off the lotion and to cool my face down would put on the nighttime version.</li>
            <li> After one use of both the facial wash and the lotion my skin was smoother, softer, lighter, more even, and less dark spots.  </li>
            <li> For men with sensitive skin, you really cannot beat Visibly Even, especially for the price; and I&#x27;ve used Menscience, Anthony Logistics, Murad, and a host of other products from the MASC Skincare site.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little thicker than what I expected, but it&#x27;s fine because it goes on well.  </li>
            <li> Moisturizes normal to dry skin.</li>
            <li> During the wintertime when my skin is extremely dry, I use the Lumene Dry Skin Radiance Cocktail first and then this, and the dryness is gone all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really notice a difference other than the moisture.</li>
            <li> I thought I would try this out because I do have an uneven skin tone and so far, I really like it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent sooooo much money only skin</li>
            <li> I am a 22 year old African American girl  </li>
            <li> For 2 years prior to using this moisturizer, I had been using a very nice (and very expensive) daily moisturizer from Sephora.</li>
            <li> I did break out a little when I first started using it, but since then haven&#x27;t had any issues.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little heavy/greasy and a little does not go a long way, so mainly in the summer, I mix it with a light moisturizer (aside from this I use Clinique).</li>
            <li> I used this for my skin as opposed to my face for some skin discolorations and it made my skin smooth and began to make the dark spots less noticeable.</li>
            <li> and it really does lighten some of the dark spots on my face.</li>
            <li> I saw a dermatologist not long ago.</li>
            <li> (still not sure if that was the right choice).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just kept on with the half fast job for months up until tonight when I finished the bottle.</li>
            <li> (I have some light scarring from acne, and a few dark spots from the sun).</li>
            <li> I recently went on a complete revamping of my (limitedly stocked, admittedly) makeup drawer.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer would actually burn my skin a little in certain places, specifically the apples of my cheeks.  </li>
            <li> I have olive, oily skin but am now old enough where teenage &amp;#34;acne&amp;#34; treatments dry my skin out too much....yet somehow still get acne...</li>
            <li> I use it every morning with a little blush and lipstick and I&#x27;m ready to go.</li>
            <li> Have not heard in bad news, so I&#x27;ll assume that&#x27;s a good thing...</li>
            <li> Unlike other moisturizers or sunscreens, an hour after I put it on my face isn&#x27;t completely shiny.  </li>
            <li> Cons: A little dose not go a long way: The container is very small and it is not the most hydrating of moisturizers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I can really notice a &amp;#34;visibly even&amp;#34; smoothing effect.</li>
            <li> I used up the entire tube over a long period of time</li>
            <li> this should be long enough for the tears to heal; you can still wash your face with water).  </li>
            <li> A tube goes a long way, too - after 10 weeks of using this, I just this week opened my 2nd tube!</li>
            <li> if your skin is too sensitive for it, then I&#x27;d suggest this one - hands down - for men.</li>
            <li> What I got this time was nothing like it other than the general packaging.</li>
            <li> Even though the active ingredients in this Neutrogena product is/are different from Kinerase&#x27;s, they accomplish the same thing.</li>
            <li> Incredibly fantastic for acne that occurred in oily areas (almost eliminating it entirely), mediocre for acne in non-oily areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> driving on long trips.</li>
            <li> The dark spots from past acne scars are really fading!</li>
            <li> I was so surprised at first, thinking I saw it wrong.</li>
            <li> Feels light, a little dollop goes a long way, and my skin hasn&#x27;t broken out or gotten greasy after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> the only other soy face moisturizer i have used or is at the stores.</li>
            <li> Areas where I had excessive oil before, however, have \\&quot;prevented\\&quot; and \\&quot;healed\\&quot; acne almost completely!</li>
            <li> nd stays on for a very long time.</li>
            <li> if you have dry skin then it highlights the dry skin.</li>
            <li> Once it dries, it doesn&#x27;t look or feel greasy, but it doesn&#x27;t leave your skin completely dry either.</li>
            <li> I have really dry patches that this moisturizes but does not make my skin oily like others do</li>
            <li> I have dry skin, and I find that after use of this product, my skin has become somewhat drier than before.  </li>
            <li> My skin is dry after I wash it</li>
            <li> I could not live without this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I am a 19 year old Black American and I was looking for a product that would even out my skin tone and lighten the dark spots on my face due to acne.  </li>
            <li> As a dark spot corrector, it takes several weeks to see results, but I feel that it works.</li>
            <li> I have dark skin (about the same as Lupita Nyong&#x27;o).</li>
            <li> Otherwise I liked the texture, just disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Not very gentle.</li>
            <li> i am not sure if it wll improve my skin tone, but i am going to keep wearing it anyway because it is lightweight with enough sunscreen to protect me while allowing a thin layer of foundation on top that doesnt look heavy!</li>
            <li> The only thing I personally don&#x27;t like about it, is the fact that it has a heavy scent!</li>
            <li> My skin tends to get very dry in winter, but I want something that won&#x27;t clog pores and that may even help balance my skin out</li>
            <li> just thought of that real wuick hope it helped, and remember there is a helpful tool for those suckers to die!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find decent non-comedogenic sunscreen for skin that&#x27;s medium to dark in tone.</li>
            <li> I have been using this moisturizer on a daily basis for a little over a month now.</li>
            <li> Imagine my surprise (and dismay) to find myself in my late 20s/early30s with both acne AND early wrinkles.  ???  </li>
            <li> I will say to be careful around eyes.</li>
            <li> After a week, I noticed that some uneven skin tone left by acne marks had begun to fade.</li>
            <li> I have not really noticed a difference in my skin yet.  </li>
            <li> This happens hours after carefully applying it to my face.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ve tried a few different things (dermalogica, bliss, etc) and laid off the Noxema</li>
            <li> the wash and the moisturizer say it takes up to 8 weeks to see results on dark marks and those 8 weeks are long gone by now</li>
            <li> bought both at my local drugstore to get the ball rolling, and was pleasantly surprised by the moisturizer, and sublimely annoyed by the foundation.</li>
            <li> I use to have small acne spots but after several months of use I couldn&#x27;t point out a single acne mark.  </li>
            <li> Hydrates my skin, makes it less dry.</li>
            <li> My face tends to get shiny and over-produce oil after i shave close (against the grain) and the soy complex in this moisturizer makes my face matte, something no other matte cleaner or lotion could do.</li>
            <li> I have an oily T-zone and acne-prone skin, so I can&#x27;t speak for other skin types.</li>
            <li> If you want a lotion for all the other reasons, then ya...</li>
            <li> Does not irritate skin like other products</li>
            <li> Skin care products are foreign territory but on a whim I bought this.  </li>
            <li> and I had a birth mark that grew due to the sun</li>
            <li> And I can wear this moisterizer with NO MAKEUP into the outside world without feeling like I&#x27;m scaring small children.  </li>
            <li> Since using the Neutrogena Visibly Even Daily Moisturizer for the past 5 months, I have noticed an evening out of my skin tone and a fading of the darkness on my cheeks.  </li>
            <li> Add in mild acne scarring and an uneven skin tone, and you get a very troubled teen.</li>
            <li> I initially purchased this product because I found a cure for my acne and needed a way to rush the healing of the acne scars that were left behind.</li>
            <li> if I know I&#x27;m going to be active that day.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t be without it, the dark spots have faded and my skin is moisturized with the added benefit of a sunscreen.</li>
            <li> With this face cream, the dark spots fade in weeks.</li>
            <li> my dark spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t see one bit of difference in my skin, not even a reduction in blotchiness or dark spots.  </li>
            <li> I have used this for the past year and I will continue to for as long as Neutrogena produces it.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen a difference in my dark spots, and I&#x27;ve also been having the problem where oil is coming out instead of a blended cream.</li>
            <li> I am in my 40s with olive skin, so dark spots are an issue for me.  </li>
            <li> It lasts for months and faded dark spots and discolorations on my face.</li>
            <li> It really helps your skin and for the price, it beats even those expensive creams that sometimes lie about their results.</li>
            <li> I also want to mention that I go to school and work in an area that has heat of 110F average, sometimes peaking at 116F.</li>
            <li> However, my dark mark around my eyes are getting lighter.</li>
            <li> It creates an even completion and over time fades dark spots.</li>
            <li> I think it was either the sunscreen or the dark spot reducing components that did this to my skin.  </li>
            <li> Not fun.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Complexion: dark brown&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 29, plus or minus a few years.  </li>
            <li> I bought this moisturizer about two weeks ago hoping it would help clear up a bad reaction to a new face cleanser.</li>
            <li> No use for any skin lightening, other than helping you not to get a sunburn!</li>
            <li> I usually use another moisturizer after this one on the areas that still feel dry.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Normally I use the Neutrogena &amp;#34;Oil-free moisture&amp;#34; as a facial lotion, but it was a little too thick and greasy to use underneath makeup.</li>
            <li> I probably only have one pimple in those pre-existing problem areas once every 10 days, but very small.</li>
            <li> The red blotches on my face were so bad, I was ready to make an appointment with a dermatologist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I have to use so much less of it for that reason.</li>
            <li> : The product has a slight fragrance</li>
            <li> However, this does not adequately moisturize my skin.  </li>
            <li> This also has a fragrance that gives me a slight headache.</li>
            <li> The moisturizer also has a very distinct sunscreen smell, which I find unpleasant, since you can buy other SPF 15 products that hardly have any smell at all.</li>
            <li> my skin turned into this mess of issues).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My pimple scars/marks are gone in about a month maybe little less.</li>
            <li> a new product because it was &amp;#34;less&amp;#34; expensive and boy</li>
            <li> My only complaint was the tube was small...</li>
            <li> I have some age spots and a little Melasma on my forehead</li>
            <li> Like i&#x27;ll go to squeeze a little onto my finger</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, it does seem to fade dark spots!</li>
            <li> every little spot or anything like that,</li>
            <li> Evens out my skin, even if it&#x27;s a little rosy.  </li>
            <li> And the little I know, the break out followed after.</li>
            <li> a little to heavy for me.</li>
            <li> It seems to last 3-4 months for me applying once per day, but I don&#x27;t put it on very thick.</li>
            <li> an uneven skin tone.</li>
            <li> I do see a small improvement in my dark spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Since using it, I&#x27;ve received a few compliments on how my face is glowing and has color!&lt;br /</li>
            <li> She has always had problem skin--sensitive, uneven, blotchy, clogged pores, etc.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Not too heavy.</li>
            <li> After a few days I started seeing a difference on my face.</li>
            <li> I have uneven combo skin with acne scars.</li>
            <li> I use eye cream and a face serum underneath it everyday.</li>
            <li> it has no greasy or heavy feel/</li>
            <li> Has SPF for daytime, and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy.</li>
            <li> My uneven skin tone has almost disappeared, and my skin is smoother than it has ever been.  </li>
            <li> I have been using  this moisturizer for less than a month now and can say that I am hooked!</li>
            <li> No more dark spots!</li>
            <li> First off, I noticed that even when I shake it vigorously, the product separates, almost like sunscreen that has gone bad?</li>
            <li> have got bad acne marks near d chin nd nose, but 8 days of use, nd the marks are slowly blending, into the skin and making the overall face look neutral nd not splotchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Actually had this on with my make up the other day and was sweating like crazy but it seemed to help keep my makeup in tact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used this product during the winter months as it is a little thick</li>
            <li> It burns my eyes like crazy, even if I dont put it near my eyes, it still finds a way to get into them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used lots of Neutrogena products in the past with no problem, so I feel that it must be the sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> Second, it makes my skin feel greasy, and rendered my concealer and foundation completely useless.</li>
            <li> The Visibly Even moisturizer was actually making my skin look worse!</li>
            <li> All of the uneven skin tone has disappeared!</li>
            <li> I have been through several brands(including expensive name brand) moisturizers.  </li>
            <li> usually have issues with spf (as I have allergic reactions)</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I saw an increase of pimples and oiliness on my forehead within 2 weeks of regularly applying this.</li>
            <li> : My nose and forehead are always quite shiny after application, and I usually have to dab around a bit with a towel to try and reduce that, which is a pain.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a moisturizer with SPF - not much more to say.</li>
            <li> The only thing that gets annoying is that sometimes, a weird oily substance comes out of the bottle instead of the cream, but I&#x27;m just assuming that is the SPF oil that hasn&#x27;t gotten mixed with the moisturizing cream enough.</li>
            <li> If you tend to react to sunscreens negatively, you should use with caution.</li>
            <li> No more painting my face with thick makeup!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t consider my skin that sensitive, so I was really disappointed this seemed to antagonize my skin.</li>
            <li> I had stopped using my Kinerase because my budget is too tight now for expensive skin products.</li>
            <li> if you have bad acne, which was me 2 months ago, go to your regular doctor and they will prescribe you medication,.</li>
            <li> mine wasnt so bad that i need oral medice, but i have 2 topical medications.</li>
            <li> They haven&#x27;t got any worse, so I say this works.</li>
            <li> Instead of helping, it made my face worse.</li>
            <li> It really made any blemishes and scars I had on my face stand out, which was horrible.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to anyone whose face has that &amp;#34; tired look&amp;#34; as mine did.</li>
            <li> I was not happy with any of them.</li>
            <li> What it was ultimately, was annoying.</li>
            <li> I have a really bad problem with redness on each side of my nose, and I promise you that it has drastically calmed down since I started to use this product.</li>
            <li> It is very subtle.</li>
            <li> And when I ran out and used a different moisturizer I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I already have oily skin, and this just makes it look worse!</li>
            <li> actually fading all of these horrific scars i have had all these years!</li>
            <li> This is my secret!</li>
            <li> I had used this for years, and then it disappeared and I was unable to find it anywhere</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really sad</li>
            <li> Please Neutrogena do not discontinue this product, I am finding it difficult to find in stores which lead me to Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sad to say that this did nothing for that.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen it even out my skin tone or anything which is sad to say cause I hope it would have worked.</li>
            <li> I was very sad, I was unable to find anything that matched up to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin suffers from hyperpigmentation.</li>
            <li> This is disappointing to write</li>
            <li> I will be very, very sad if/when this product is discontinued.</li>
            <li> And the smell is quite bad -</li>
            <li> and it makes me sweat like crazy!</li>
            <li> Annoying if you have a skin routine and fear this might smudge your products underneath all over the place.</li>
            <li> stinks!!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;So disappointed!</li>
            <li> It just worked terribly for me!</li>
            <li> Perhaps this will still work for you, if you are not in terrible heat.</li>
            <li> 30 years ago, i was in a horrible motorcycle accident, and was told i would lose my leg if the skin grafts they did</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> a little to heavy for me.</li>
            <li> This bb cream is excellent, it evens out my skin tone and helps control oil throughout the day.  I do not think this would qualify as a moisturizer and if you have dry skin then it highlights the dry skin. I use this in the morning after washing and moisturizing my face. No complaints because I didn&#x27;t buy it because I wanted a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Purchases for someone else... Have not heard in bad news, so I&#x27;ll assume that&#x27;s a good thing...</li>
            <li> I am your classic fair and freckled person, so I need sunblock (whether in lotion or clothing form) all the time. This is a great moisturizer and sunblock, plus it doesn&#x27;t irritate my face as some moisturizer/sunblock combos have. I couldn&#x27;t recommend this more!</li>
            <li> I swore by Visibly Even after I got turned onto it by Ross, the guy from &amp;#34;Skincare With Ross&amp;#34;.  For men with sensitive skin, you really cannot beat Visibly Even, especially for the price; and I&#x27;ve used Menscience, Anthony Logistics, Murad, and a host of other products from the MASC Skincare site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try the Ageless Intensives line from Neutrogena...if your skin is too sensitive for it, then I&#x27;d suggest this one - hands down - for men.</li>
            <li> I have pretty good skin and didn&#x27;t used to use a moisturizer or even a cleanser beforehand, so be forewarned that my review may be biased in that sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I started using this moisturizer though, my skin is visibly clearer and much softer, and when I go a week without using it, I can literally see and feel a huge difference. My skin isn&#x27;t as clear or as soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the only moisturizer I have ever used, but I am really happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t use it after just washing my face in the skin though, I have to apply it after a shower, or else my skin will be too greasy. It won&#x27;t break out or anything, it just won&#x27;t absorb as well. I guess the shower dries my skin out enough that the moisturizer absorbs.</li>
            <li> Finally! I&#x27;ve found a product that doesn&#x27;t break me out! I have some age spots and a little Melasma on my forehead and this seems to keep them under control. I haven&#x27;t noticed any fading but my spots are pretty relentless. They haven&#x27;t got any worse, so I say this works.</li>
            <li> I love this product, together with the night antiwrinkle cream, you may not be able to guess my age! I am 33 and loving it!</li>
            <li> Great! No more dark spots!</li>
            <li> I have a sensitive skin but this one is very mild and gentle on the face.. not oily and dries faster than other moisturizers PLUS it has SPF 30. The best part is that it actually works! My pimple scars/marks are gone in about a month maybe little less. I know it is not that quick but way better than the other products that says will remove marks/darkening etc.. and not do anything even after 6 months or more. Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I purchased this item to correct some blemish scars on my skin. Instead of helping, it made my face worse. The first time i applied it, my face started stinging. I thought it might be the way it supposed to feel so i ignored it, but by the end of the first week i had broken out completely!!!!! I discontinued using it and Im still waiting for all these new blemishes to go away. It just worked terribly for me!</li>
            <li> I use this moisturizer along with the foaming face wash. They work wonders on my complexion! I have tried a lot of other products and these are by far the best!! I will definitely stick to Neutrogena skin care products because I know they work!!</li>
            <li> I have used this lotion for over a year now, every morning.  I wouldn&#x27;t be without it, the dark spots have faded and my skin is moisturized with the added benefit of a sunscreen.</li>
            <li> After using the Visibly Even Foaming cleanser, I apply Best Vitamin C Serum 2015, then this moisturizer. My skin tone is improving every week! The dark spots from past acne scars are really fading!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about two weeks now, and I can tell that it has made a difference. I have acne scars on my cheeks and (used to have) an uneven skin tone. This moisturizer has \\&quot;smoothed\\&quot; my acne scars and has evened out my skin tone noticeably. The reason for the four stars is that it&#x27;s not quite as moisturizing as I would have liked. I usually use another moisturizer after this one on the areas that still feel dry. However, the smell is pleasant and does not linger for long. I have to say that I like it better than the Aveeno positively radiant moisturizer, which did not even out my skin tone at all. Overall, I will be buying this Neutrogena product again.</li>
            <li> PROS: 1. Protects skin from sun. 2. I do see a small improvement in my dark spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: 1. Makes my skin look and feel so oily! I already have oily skin, and this just makes it look worse! 2. Not too good for summer time because it sweats off since it isnt water resistant. 3. It burns my eyes like crazy, even if I dont put it near my eyes, it still finds a way to get into them. It hurts so bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t repurschasing. I like the Aveeno Daily Moisturizer spf 30 better!</li>
            <li> i love it but still did not see results in terms of fading my acne scar. still waiting but definitly nice as moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This product goes on lightly but I developed a reaction to the sunscreen in it.  I&#x27;ve used lots of Neutrogena products in the past with no problem, so I feel that it must be the sunscreen.  If you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, you would find this to be a good moisturizer, and the price is much better than the moisturizer with sunscreen sold by brand name makeup companies.  If you tend to react to sunscreens negatively, you should use with caution.</li>
            <li> An excellent moisturizer and also 30 for Sun protection.  This moisturizer really does a good job no stickiness and no fragrance except a very clean aroma.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years as my primary moisturizer, and I love it. It works as a moisturizer, sunscreen, and spot corrector. As a moisturizer, it does the trick in keeping my skin quenched. As a dark spot corrector, it takes several weeks to see results, but I feel that it works. My skin suffers from hyperpigmentation. If I get acne or blemishes, I&#x27;m left with scars that take 6 months to fade. With this face cream, the dark spots fade in weeks. The SPF in the product also helps prevent additional sun damage from &amp;#34;tanning&amp;#34; my dark spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It lasts me months before I have to buy a new bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re applying during hot weather, allow it to dry completely and pat the moisture with a tissue before you apply makeup. I find that it makes me sweat a little more (it&#x27;s a thicker cream), so I need to air it out and let it absorb properly to prevent the grease buildup. I wait about five minutes for it to absorb before I move on with my makeup routine. Once it dries, it doesn&#x27;t look or feel greasy, but it doesn&#x27;t leave your skin completely dry either. I have an oily T-zone and acne-prone skin, so I can&#x27;t speak for other skin types.</li>
            <li> Love this product! I&#x27;ve used it for about 2 years. Keeps this 58 year old face looking bright and smooth.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this as I work in the sun all day during the summer months. I bought it during the winter, so I haven&#x27;t really had a chance to use it in direct sunlight, but I like the way it feels.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for! My doctor recommended SPF 30 or higher for my face and this has worked perfectly. My face feels healthier and happier using it and my skin is smoother.</li>
            <li> It is nice and lightweight and moisturizes perfectly, but every time i use it it comes out weird for awhile. Like i&#x27;ll go to squeeze a little onto my finger but it&#x27;ll be mostly oil instead of the white lotion. I&#x27;ll just rinse off my finger until only lotion is coming out. I shake the bottle before use every time but it still doesn&#x27;t help much. I do feel like it makes my skin brighter</li>
            <li> I bought this on Amazon because it isn&#x27;t offered where I live.  I have to say that this is an amazing product.  I am a 19 year old Black American and I was looking for a product that would even out my skin tone and lighten the dark spots on my face due to acne.  After one use of both the facial wash and the lotion my skin was smoother, softer, lighter, more even, and less dark spots.  I have combination skin and with the lotion it put the right amount of moisture on all areas of my face.  When I used the facial wash there was an instant change on my face.  This is certainly a 5 star product in my book, after searching for the right products I&#x27;ve finally found a line that would work just for me.  Thank you Neutrogena for making amazing products.</li>
            <li> Very nice, haven&#x27;t used long enough to make good review</li>
            <li> Excellent moisturizer - great bang for your buck!! love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d definitely recommend this for sensitive skin.  A lot of creams sting and burn, especially when it comes to SPF, but this is mild and great for everyday use.  My dermatologist always recommends Neutrogena products, and this has been my favorite so far.</li>
            <li> I have been using this moisturizer for several years. When local stores stopped selling it, I ordered this from Amazon. Unfortunately it is not the same quality it had. This moisturizer makes my skin oily.</li>
            <li> very nice. my face to be tender</li>
            <li> Women, highly recommend.  I don&#x27;t use anything else.  I&#x27;m 53 and people say I look 10 years younger and I have this to thank for.  I&#x27;ve use this for years and it&#x27;s protected my face.</li>
            <li> I love the texture, smell and how it really is a great sunblock under makeup, w/out a greasy or white look, you know how some sunscreens do.  It says it &amp;#34;helps reduce blotchiness &amp; the look of darks spots.&amp;#34;  I used up the entire tube over a long period of time and I didn&#x27;t see one bit of difference in my skin, not even a reduction in blotchiness or dark spots.  If you want a lotion for all the other reasons, then ya... it&#x27;s great.  So that&#x27;s why I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars but 3.</li>
            <li> I actually found another product that works WAY BETTER.  I bought this for my brown spots and sun screen.  No changes in the spots so I bought another product that after just one week I can see a difference.  Live and learn.</li>
            <li> Works the first time better than this</li>
            <li> Great results already.</li>
            <li> I only just started using this, but have noticed immediate results. My skin looks vibrant and has a nice healthy glow. I needed to purchase this to get rid of red blotches I got from using the Neutrogena pore refining cleanser and it has already cleared them up in no time. The red blotches on my face were so bad, I was ready to make an appointment with a dermatologist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Normally I use the Neutrogena &amp;#34;Oil-free moisture&amp;#34; as a facial lotion, but it was a little too thick and greasy to use underneath makeup. It made my face look too shiny. (I could only apply it at nighttime before bed). This was the one product that worked perfectly for clearing up red, blotchy skin and evening-out skin tone. It goes on smooth and light and can easily be used underneath makeup without causing any oiliness. It has extra moisturizing agents (more so than the regular Nuetrogena oil-free mousturizer) and I have to use so much less of it for that reason. I use in the morning for an instant glow (when applied with my usual makeup) providing the healthy looking glow that my skin was lacking.</li>
            <li> I used it for about 3 weeks straight and noticed I was getting a lot more pimples than usual. So I just stopped it recently. I also didn&#x27;t notice any more \\&quot;evenness\\&quot; in my complexion at all....not gonna use it anymore.</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed this product.  It is like a very light makeup that contains sunscreen.  However, if I have it on all day it gathers in the creased of my skin so I won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
            <li> It goes on very light, and does it&#x27;s job.  I use it mainly for sunscreen.  I have very sensitive skin and every lotion I have&lt;br /&gt;tried has caused either a breakout or irritation, but so far so good.  I will buy more when I run out.</li>
            <li> I could not live without this moisturizer. My face tends to get shiny and over-produce oil after i shave close (against the grain) and the soy complex in this moisturizer makes my face matte, something no other matte cleaner or lotion could do. Aveeno&#x27;s soy moisturizer does not keep my face matte as well as this does, and thats the only other soy face moisturizer i have used or is at the stores. Please, don&#x27;t even think about discontinuing this lotion; i saw it on clearance at albertsons. I have used this for the past year and I will continue to for as long as Neutrogena produces it.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent addition to anyone&#x27;s skincare regime. It not only moisturises my face but also tones and evens out my skin that I wish I had found it sooner :)</li>
            <li> I pretty much like all Neutrogena products.</li>
            <li> Very good, can&#x27;t leave the house without using this. Hydrates my skin, makes it less dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over three months now. Mostly Monday through Friday and even though I don&#x27;t think it works for fading spots. The SPF amount is great for my everyday use under makeup with enough protection.</li>
            <li> I used it every day for 8 weeks...  I would never recommend this product. Please do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer for about two months. I haven&#x27;t seen a difference in my dark spots, and I&#x27;ve also been having the problem where oil is coming out instead of a blended cream. I wait until nothing is coming out but the cream to apply, but it leaves me very greasy. I won&#x27;t be repurchasing.</li>
            <li> I bought this moisturizer about two weeks ago hoping it would help clear up a bad reaction to a new face cleanser. First of all, this has glitter in it, which I wasn&#x27;t expecting. And it&#x27;s noticeable even under foundation and concealer. Second, it makes my skin feel greasy, and rendered my concealer and foundation completely useless. After using it for two weeks and not seeing any difference in the tone of my skin, yesterday I switched back to my old moisturizer and noticed my skin looked much better- no blotchiness at all. The Visibly Even moisturizer was actually making my skin look worse! It really made any blemishes and scars I had on my face stand out, which was horrible. I don&#x27;t consider my skin that sensitive, so I was really disappointed this seemed to antagonize my skin. I even applied it to my arm and noticed it caused redness there too. I&#x27;ll keep the bottle and use it for sunscreen this summer, since I paid almost fifteen dollars for it, but I won&#x27;t ever buy this again.</li>
            <li> Makes skin feel so soft and have noticed sun spots getting lighter.</li>
            <li> I am 59 years old and have tried many products through the years for uneven skin tone. I decided to give this a try since I recently moved to the beach and would be exposed to more sun. I have been using  this moisturizer for less than a month now and can say that I am hooked! My face looks better now than it did 10 years ago! All of the uneven skin tone has disappeared! I don&#x27;t even use a foundation anymore. I use it every morning with a little blush and lipstick and I&#x27;m ready to go. LOVE it!!! it&#x27;s really amazing and does much more than I expected. I would recommend it to anyone whose face has that &amp;#34; tired look&amp;#34; as mine did. It&#x27;s wonderful!</li>
            <li> I use these the most for care of my skin.</li>
            <li> After using this for a week, My husband noticed and kept saying my skin looked clean and clear.  I am in my 40s with olive skin, so dark spots are an issue for me.  My skin is in pretty good shape because I have been using quality skin care products for years, but this cream did make noticeable improvements and it protects my skin from the harsh Arizona sun. Can&#x27;t beat that.</li>
            <li> Smells good, feels good and I can see a difference.</li>
            <li> This is actually just sunscreen. Check the ingredients.No use for any skin lightening, other than helping you not to get a sunburn!</li>
            <li> So, when I initially started using this, it was amazing. However, after a couple of days, I started getting bumps....something I never get. This has caused more scarring for me than I had previously and it&#x27;s not that great of a moisturizer. If it could stop breaking me out, I&#x27;d love it!</li>
            <li> I got this to wear daily under makeup. My skin tends to get very dry in winter, but I want something that won&#x27;t clog pores and that may even help balance my skin out (I have some light scarring from acne, and a few dark spots from the sun). I trust Neutrogena not to break me out, and I really like their products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me say that this is definitely more of a sunscreen than a moisturizer. Most people will like that it&#x27;s light and not &amp;#34;lotion-y,&amp;#34; but that also means it does virtually nothing for dry skin. It&#x27;s fine for me in the summer, but in winter, I will need something more heavy duty for that dull winter skin! This doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out or anything and does add some moisture, but I wouldn&#x27;t really call it a moisturizer. It is basically sunscreen. HOWEVER, it does seem to fade dark spots! I notice a definite difference. Not a cure of course, but definitely an improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally will continue to use this in warmer months but switch to something more intensely moisturizing in the colder months. If you&#x27;re looking for a base sunscreen layer under makeup, this is great, though!</li>
            <li> This is the only neutrogena moisturizer that is light weight enough to wear under your foundation!!! It makes my skin feel really smooth. i am not sure if it wll improve my skin tone, but i am going to keep wearing it anyway because it is lightweight with enough sunscreen to protect me while allowing a thin layer of foundation on top that doesnt look heavy!</li>
            <li> Ive used this moisturizer for over 5 years. It evens my skin tone and brightens it gives it an amazing glow. I get compliments on how great my skin looks. It lasts for months and faded dark spots and discolorations on my face.</li>
            <li> My face doesnt get greasy by the end of the day like some moisturizers do. I havent got burnt since I started using it and it almost matte-ifies your face to make it look clearer. Good buy, doesnt &amp;#34;tint&amp;#34; your face but makes it appear more flawless and shrinks the look of pores. Overall I like it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used  visibly even for many years,  my 20 year old daughter love it too.... I am a fair skin women in my 50 &#x27; s and I would not substitute this brand for nothing is why I orders from amazon..... it appears that the drug stores don&#x27;t carry it a much as they use to or its flying off the shelves. .... lol...... I love it !!!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t ever have to buy a better moisturizer ever since I found about this. It really helps your skin and for the price, it beats even those expensive creams that sometimes lie about their results.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this moisturizer! I&#x27;m a guy and 20 years old. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month and I&#x27;ve noticed several amazing things improved on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Color: Since using it, I&#x27;ve received a few compliments on how my face is glowing and has color!&lt;br /&gt;* Texture: My skin feels much much smoother on the outside. My skin has this great soft, smooth feeling and visible texture.&lt;br /&gt;* Feeling: On the inside, my face feels hydrated! I don&#x27;t know how to explain how great my face feels. Before, around 2pm, my face would start to feel (and look) oily and that \\&quot;grimy\\&quot; feeling. Now I feel extra fresh in the morning and I only sort of feel that \\&quot;grimy\\&quot; feeling by around 7pm.&lt;br /&gt;* Smell: The product has a slight fragrance and I think it smells great. It&#x27;s difficult to describe a smell, but I can tell you that it isn&#x27;t strong and the smell is actually very pleasant and soothing. I&#x27;m a guy and the smell doesn&#x27;t bother me--it smells \\&quot;soothing\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;* Acne: I have combination skin and I&#x27;ve noticed that my mild-moderate acne \\&quot;heals\\&quot; faster. Areas where I had excessive oil before, however, have \\&quot;prevented\\&quot; and \\&quot;healed\\&quot; acne almost completely! I probably only have one pimple in those pre-existing problem areas once every 10 days, but very small. However, I do want to stress that this hasn&#x27;t solved my mild acne on my lower cheeks where I&#x27;ve never had a problem with oil/dryness. Incredibly fantastic for acne that occurred in oily areas (almost eliminating it entirely), mediocre for acne in non-oily areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also want to mention that I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer with Neutrogena Visibly Even Foaming Cleanser. I apply the cleanser in the morning and night, but I only apply the moisturizer in the morning after cleansing. I love the cleanser also and definitely recommend you purchase the gentle cleanser alongside this moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** Update Edit (11 July 2014) ***&lt;br /&gt;I want to emphasize the product still works like I said in my first review in Spring, however, the product&#x27;s has caused an outward appearance of shininess and I feel like washing my face with a cleanser by 12pm because of such built up shininess. I also want to mention that I go to school and work in an area that has heat of 110F average, sometimes peaking at 116F. The product worked and \\&quot;felt\\&quot; best when temperatures were around 70F-85F, during Spring. Perhaps this will still work for you, if you are not in terrible heat. I still love the product and will return to it after the heat starts to drop. Meanwhile, I&#x27;m switching to Paula&#x27;s Choice Skin Balancing Invisible Finish Moisture Gel in hopes I can hold a matte finish look, while fulfilling my moisturizing needs. I&#x27;ll update my review later.</li>
            <li> Been using it for 4 weeks, it&#x27;s non greasy and non drying my spots seem to be getting clearer would recommend</li>
            <li> (This review is written by Alastair&#x27;s wife) Watch out,Kinerase. I won&#x27;t be paying $80 USD for your product any longer. Even though the active ingredients in this Neutrogena product is/are different from Kinerase&#x27;s, they accomplish the same thing. I decided to try this because I saw my sister for the first time in a couple of years. She has always had problem skin--sensitive, uneven, blotchy, clogged pores, etc. I had stopped using my Kinerase because my budget is too tight now for expensive skin products. When I saw my sister this visit, I couldn&#x27;t believe it--her skin looks amazing! When she told me it was because of this Neutrogena product, I hustled out to buy some at around $13 USD for the tube. Within two days I could see my skin going back to the smooth glow I used to get from Kinerase. Wow. No kidding--this stuff really works, and fast. I&#x27;m in my mid-fifties, fyi.</li>
            <li> Not greasy and is a great product.  However, I&#x27;m concerned that it might not be moisturizing enough.  However, I still love this product.  It absorbs well.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this daily moisturizer. My dark spots were gone within one week and my skin is more of a even tone. It works for all tones too. This is a product I will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> Not very gentle. My skin is too sensitive for this product.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like the way it made my skin feel.  Makeup did not go on smoothly over this.</li>
            <li> The only moisturizer I use, Neutrogena Visibly Even keep the thought of wrinkles at bay. I also believe it&#x27;s responsible for my skin tone evening and the texture smoothing out. Can&#x27;t recommend high enough!</li>
            <li> I used this for my skin as opposed to my face for some skin discolorations and it made my skin smooth and began to make the dark spots less noticeable. My only complaint was the tube was small...neutrogena shld make it in a bigger size</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t even tried it yet but fortunately for me, I did not try it on my sensitive face yet because they sold me an EXPIRED product. I bought it two weeks ago and did not even check the item because I read customer reviews for this seller and it seemed there was no problem. so I did not touch it until today (I have a lot of skincare products so I was thinking about saving it until I finished my current one. I decided to try it today to see how it feels, and I saw the expiration date was May 2014. I was so surprised at first, thinking I saw it wrong. I turned my light on, just so I can make sure I saw everything right, I checked with my bf as well. YET the item is expired, it is said EXP 2015/04. I do not know if it is a mistake to send me an expired item or not, but either way, it is unethical and irresponsible. It is a skincare product, it could totally ruin my face. Lucky for me, I checked it before using, and I checked it just 2 weeks after I bought it, not months after.</li>
            <li> love this moisturizer...skin seems instantly brighter and &amp;#34;dewy&amp;#34; after application  dermatologist said i should be shooting for an spf 50...after trying another kind, im missing this one but seems it doesnt come in a high spf!  come on neutrogena...would love to see it!</li>
            <li> Been using this product for over 8 years!!!! In addition to drinking more water this product has cleared my skin drastically! I use to have small acne spots but after several months of use I couldn&#x27;t point out a single acne mark.  I called myself &amp;#34;trying&amp;#34; a new product because it was &amp;#34;less&amp;#34; expensive and boy could I tell the difference.  Living in NYC the prices are all jacked up and paying $20 for a daily moisturizer was becoming unbearable.  Thank goodness for AMAZON because its much cheaper on here.</li>
            <li> Only need a tiny bit to apply to face and neck.  Unlike others I&#x27;ve used, makeup goes on afterward evenly and easily.  I will buy again.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few weeks. I have not noticed any key changes in my complexion, but I think that this moisturizer is very lightweight and feels like silk on my skin. I really like the texture of it. I hope that it will even out my skin tone as I continue to use it. It does not cause me to break out which is great!</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t like products with sunscreen in them even though I know we need protection.</li>
            <li> This product really works! This is a really good investment. I received it about a week after I ordered it and I put it on the next day. Within a week, I noticed my skin was visibly more even, and my acne scars were slightly duller. I&#x27;m African American, so finding a good moisturizer for my skin tone has been difficult. The SPF 30 is also great-the cream goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t make your face look too greasy or shiny. It is very subtle. My skin also feels smoother after using it, and it doesn&#x27;t clog the pores on my face either. The only thing that gets annoying is that sometimes, a weird oily substance comes out of the bottle instead of the cream, but I&#x27;m just assuming that is the SPF oil that hasn&#x27;t gotten mixed with the moisturizing cream enough. Overall, I would definitely recommend this for anyone looking for a good moisturizer-your skin will look amazing!</li>
            <li> Have used this product for years - ever since I started with uneven skin tone on my face, and it works beautifully.  I do not wear makeup, so even skin tone is important to me.  It is lightweight so it is perfect for summer time when heavier lotions can be too much.</li>
            <li> A little understood truth about beautiful skin is that it has a lot to do with the evenness of the skin&#x27;s color: not the amount of pigmentation, but the evenness of pigment distribution. Used consistently over a period of at least several months, Visibly Even does what the name implies; it makes the skin&#x27;s color appear to be more even. Here&#x27;s an example. I saw a dermatologist not long ago. She first took a very close look at my face skin, and then without consulting my chart said \\&quot;you were born in 19xx, right?\\&quot; The xx was 10 years later than my actual birth year. When I said the correct year, she did a double-take. Very flattering! Granted, genes help, but I also give credit to consistent, year in, year out use of Visibly Even.</li>
            <li> When I first applied the moisturizer, it was smooth on my face. Not too heavy. I kept hearing good things about this moisturizer. After a few days I started seeing a difference on my face. It&#x27;s smooth, starting to clear and even out my skin tone. I will say to be careful around eyes. I guess I put some too close around my eyes. It made my right eye water. Learned my lesson. However, my dark mark around my eyes are getting lighter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about four days now. I was using Cetaphil&#x27;s SPF 50 daily moisturizer but it was way too greasy for me. It left my face really shiny and didn&#x27;t really moisturize all that well. I did love the fact it was SPF 50 though. I thought I would try this out because I do have an uneven skin tone and so far, I really like it. It moisturizes really well, but isn&#x27;t greasy at all. In fact, it absorbs really quickly. Doesn&#x27;t leave my face shiny or anything!  I have a really bad problem with redness on each side of my nose, and I promise you that it has drastically calmed down since I started to use this product. I&#x27;m so happy that there is something that is taming the redness! Hopefully it&#x27;ll continue to work.   The only thing I personally don&#x27;t like about it, is the fact that it has a heavy scent! I wish it was non-scented. Being a guy, I&#x27;d prefer not to have my face smell so feminine. The smell does tend to fade away as the day goes on though, so that&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> This is what we call a bang for your buck! I have uneven combo skin with acne scars. I&#x27;ve spent sooooo much money only skin it&#x27;s a joke. But this is the perfect BBQ cream. It creates an even completion and over time fades dark spots. I do wear a moisturizer under eight and use this cream as my &amp;#34;makeup&amp;#34; ... It&#x27;s all I need! No more painting my face with thick makeup! Gives the appearance of a flawless natural glow</li>
            <li> This was the second time I ordered this. Loved it the first time because it went on evenly (no streaking), was 30 spf, and I did not develop any sensitivity. What I got this time was nothing like it other than the general packaging. It was labeled &amp;#34;New&amp;#34; and displayed the words &amp;#34;BB Cream&amp;#34; after the &amp;#34;visibly even.&amp;#34; It contained a colorant/makeup and is a different formula. I want the old, clear moisturizer/sunscreen!</li>
            <li> I bought this product at my local Ulta after reading the rave reviews- I am a young student with skin that is super oily in the summer, and super dry during the winter. Add in mild acne scarring and an uneven skin tone, and you get a very troubled teen. I wasn&#x27;t looking for a deep wrinkle remover, just something to make my skin bright and even- and in just two weeks I began to notice a real difference.&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t -erase- every little spot or anything like that, but it does help. I gave it four stars because there might just be something more powerful out there, and I have been led to keep looking. I am confident that it is the best for under $15, though!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#1. It evens out my skin tone! (When used in conjunction with the matching cleanser, the evening is even better)&lt;br /&gt;#2. Doesn&#x27;t worsen oily skin. It doesn&#x27;t help either, but I use  Ben Nye Luxury Powder on top and the shine is gone.&lt;br /&gt;#3. Moisturizes normal to dry skin. During the wintertime when my skin is extremely dry, I use the Lumene Dry Skin Radiance Cocktail first and then this, and the dryness is gone all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re on a budget and want something that works, I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice as a moisturizer and light sunscreen, but it&#x27;s a tad bit on the oily side. Overall pretty effective.</li>
            <li> This was a good price, I like moisturizers with SPF in them. It&#x27;s the only way to go</li>
            <li> Love it! Very light texture</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really work super quickly or that noticeably on dark spots. Also the bottle needs to be shaken THOROUGHLY... Otherwise the liquid that comes out is a combination of oil and cream. Even when shaken thoroughly it&#x27;s still really greasy. Not the best product I&#x27;ve ever used by a long shot.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer!</li>
            <li> One of the only affordable skin-maintenance products that I&#x27;ve found that does not have lanolin or lanolates in it, which some people are allergic to.</li>
            <li> Excellent results exactly what I needed</li>
            <li> Nice and cushy at first, but then after about a week or so of using it it gets watery? Like the oil part distills from the sun lotion. Annoying if you have a skin routine and fear this might smudge your products underneath all over the place.</li>
            <li> SPF 30 protection and it really does lighten some of the dark spots on my face.</li>
            <li> love it i did the monthly thing because it&#x27;s working for me.</li>
            <li> Lightweight with SPF &#x3D; Great! Goes on smoothly and isn&#x27;t heavy.  Depending on the weather, it keeps my face moisturized all day.</li>
            <li> It seems like it has glitter in it. I feel that Neutrogena&#x27;s Rapid Repair lotions moisturize much better and is worth the extra couple dollars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Also, this is not a reason for my low grade, but if you&#x27;re aware that you have a soy allergy, take note that this contains soy. It says so on the box, but might as well mention it to be safe.)</li>
            <li> First off, I am a female but this review shows up under my husband&#x27;s name.  So this is written by a female!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy with this moisturizer! I have been through several brands(including expensive name brand) moisturizers.  I was not happy with any of them. Read the good reviews of Neutrogena Visibly Even and decided to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the way it feels after it goes on. It is not greasy and one thing I really love about it is that it is almost like a primer for my makeup.  I guess you would say a \\&quot;matte\\&quot; like finish?  I have noticed my powder goes better and seems to cover my imperfections better. It stays on longer as well. Actually had this on with my make up the other day and was sweating like crazy but it seemed to help keep my makeup in tact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No breakouts or anything yet either and I have very sensitive/acne prone skin. Actually, it may be my imagination but to me, my skin even looks better than before. I have only used this for about 2 weeks straight now so may be too soon to notice.  I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin. I break out so easily over new products. I was using Clean &amp; Clear products but they weren&#x27;t doing much for me. Plus I was 23 and realized that was more teenager stuff, so I searched for a more young adult (and underserved market; its usually teenage acne or anti-wrinkle creams) product. A friend recommended this and I noticed a difference immediately. My skin looks even. I wear foundation less because my face looks so healthy. Have been using it for almost 2 years and don&#x27;t plan on switching anytime soon.</li>
            <li> 30 years ago, i was in a horrible motorcycle accident, and was told i would lose my leg if the skin grafts they did didnt take, but thanks to the Most High, they took!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;every since then, i have been searching for something that would fade not only the parts of my thigh where they took the skin from, but also where they placed the skin, and ive found it in this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;its actually fading all of these horrific scars i have had all these years! i cant believe it but it WORKS!</li>
            <li> I recently went on a complete revamping of my (limitedly stocked, admittedly) makeup drawer. I&#x27;d been using Oil of Olay moisturizer with SPF, but my skin decided to suddenly rebel and start breaking out whenever I&#x27;d put it on. It wasn&#x27;t necessarily a rash, but it wasn&#x27;t quite acne, either. What it was ultimately, was annoying. So, I searched around on the good ol&#x27; internets for awhile and decided to switch my foundation and moisturizer to Neutrogena products, as they seemed to be favorably reviewed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought both at my local drugstore to get the ball rolling, and was pleasantly surprised by the moisturizer, and sublimely annoyed by the foundation. The moisturizer has a bit of sparkle to it, which seems to deflect some of the color aberrations present in my skin. It goes on smoothly, and absorbs quickly (as opposed to the Oil of Olay which seemed to take forever to absorb). I wear it on work days under beauty balm in the summer, and on it&#x27;s own on the weekends. When it&#x27;s cooler I&#x27;ll play around a bit with the foundation (for foundation and the BB, I have found that Maybelline&#x27;s dreamwhip foundation and their beauty balm work just fine - they aren&#x27;t greasy at all and sit lightly on my skin - the Neutrogena foundation did not).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was happy to find the moisturizer here in a subscribe and save capacity - I save a couple of bucks off of the drugstore price, and have the added convenience of having it delivered.</li>
            <li> The skin gets pretty smooth. I didn&#x27;t see any huge or immediate difference on skin&#x27;s dark spots or &amp;#34;uneveness&amp;#34;.  But the fact that the skin gets so soft is already a good thing.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. Includes needed SPF 30.  I am 66 years old, and my skin tone definitely improved while using this product.</li>
            <li> Good price and quick delivery. Love it and works well.</li>
            <li> This product is very easy to apply, does what it says it can do and is a keeper. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Love it. I always go back to this moisturizer. My Mom&#x27;s friend recommended she try it after she was referred by her dermatologist.  I was then referred and it was spot on. I have very fair skin and have had 2 basil cells removed and I don&#x27;t want any more. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I order this product all the time. I can&#x27;t find it in the stores in Toledo, Ohio so I continue to order it from Amazon. I love it.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!!! have got bad acne marks near d chin nd nose, but 8 days of use, nd the marks are slowly blending, into the skin and making the overall face look neutral nd not splotchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;its not oily so it wont come off with sweat, absorbs very easily nd stays on for a very long time. overall the best moisturizer i have used.the spf is also a plus!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;will buy again !!soon</li>
            <li> I love this product and order it time and time again. I live the SPF 30 factor and it fades the occasional blemish marks on my face.</li>
            <li> I have dark skin (about the same as Lupita Nyong&#x27;o). I always get compliments on how even my skin tone is. Even when I go to beauty departments, the makeup artists always go one about how little foundation I need because I have such good skin. This is my secret! I used to have acne scars, and some discoloration that was obvious without foundation. But because of this, I barely wear make up during the summer months. Plus it doubles as a sunscreen so your skin is protected, and it prevents scars from getting even darker in the sun. It&#x27;s a little heavy/greasy and a little does not go a long way, so mainly in the summer, I mix it with a light moisturizer (aside from this I use Clinique).</li>
            <li> Great sunscreen moisturizer! I use eye cream and a face serum underneath it everyday.</li>
            <li> I uasually love Neutrogena products.  Have a lot of products, but this one is not what I expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It stinks!!  Literally.  Foul odor.  I can&#x27;t use it during the day (which is why I ordered it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So disappointed!</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite daily moisturizer. Leaves your face with a matte finish, non greasy. Have spf 30 which is perfect for your face. I will continue to order this product.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find this in stores anymore so I was very happy to find it on amazon.  Light weight feel with 30spf to protect my face every day. And it helps even out my skin tone. I love Neutrogena products!</li>
            <li> this product came out when i was just 15 - i am 28 now - it is still the same high quality moisturizer ever ! does everything it says it does in the time it says that it does it ! i love it</li>
            <li> I recommend this product. It is great to wear everyday especially under makeup. It can make skin soft and clear and radiance to beauty!</li>
            <li> Love this moisturizer!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In just two weeks, I&#x27;ve started to notice that my age spots are fading.  I&#x27;ve tried so many lotions, serums, scrubs, masks...even green-light therapy...with no results.  I am absolutely thrilled to see this working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also a very good moisturizer with or without makeup...it has no greasy or heavy feel/look and doesn&#x27;t turn greasy over the course of the day.  It obviously contains no horrid fumes that make my eyes feel dry/irritated as do so many other products (even the unscented ones).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just hope it isn&#x27;t discontinued for some reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I&#x27;m also using the BB cream version when I bother to put something else on and alternating the cleanser with others....both of these are wonderful products and will be my only ones of their type when I run out of the other stuff I have on hand.)</li>
            <li> this is a great product.  neutrogena is the only product line i use for cleaning and moisturizing my face.  the visibly even helps my skin the best because it really eliminates dark spots over time.  if you have a darker complection (with spots), this product will probably help you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;s 13 and i love Neutrogena. i bought this hoping that it would help my redness go away. it did. use this every day straight for eight weeks, and your supposed to have amazing skin. this is my second week and i see an amazinjg differnce. i know everyone is different in their skin types but i would deffinitly recommend this product to anyone and everyone. this is a great price. they also have a neutrogena visibly even foaming cleanser which i have not tried yet but want to. good luck.&lt;br /&gt;  p.s. just a side not, you are not going to get an amazing face by just using drugstore/any cleanser. if you have bad acne, which was me 2 months ago, go to your regular doctor and they will prescribe you medication,. mine wasnt so bad that i need oral medice, but i have 2 topical medications. clindamicyn and differin. go to your doctor,it really really really really really helps! just thought of that real wuick hope it helped, and remember there is a helpful tool for those suckers to die! (your pimples):)</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me. Maybe others, but not me.</li>
            <li> This is my summer staple of facial moisturizers!</li>
            <li> Love it, will continue to use</li>
            <li> it okay great moisturizer. did not even my skin.</li>
            <li> I use it on my face and keeps  me from getting burned.I also use it on my arms when&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m driving on long trips.</li>
            <li> I am 35 years old and have been using this product for about 3 weeks.  My skin is brighter and very even.  I have stopped using BB cream all together.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I had a lot of acne blotches and after two weeks using this product I already see results. I have not even need to use make up anymore to cover. My face looks great! I will be using this product from now on. I love all Neutrogena products, they are great!</li>
            <li> Only moisturizer I will use because it actually does reduce appearance of sun spots.</li>
            <li> Big fan of this product..  the only thing i use when out in the sun as facial sunscreen.  Does not irritate skin like other products</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really notice any improvement at all in skin tone. And the smell is quite bad - which has NEVER bothered me before. I think for skin tone the Aveeno positively radiant scrub has made a MUCH bigger difference. Bio Oil is also pretty good for that. This did not make any difference in skin tone. Only reason I give it 2 stars is because I like that it has SPF.</li>
            <li> very nice daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for the last year. And when I ran out and used a different moisturizer I was very disappointed.This is amazing reduces brown spots and blemishes and great texture that does not clog the pores</li>
            <li> Was very optimistic when I purchased this.  I use Neutrogena sun tan lotion, and love it.  Put a couple dots of this moisturizer on my hands, brought them to my face, and was overcome by the odor.  Admittedly, my nose is overly sensitive to smell-will give this away.</li>
            <li> JUST THE RIGHT CONSISTENCY FOR APPLYING.&lt;br /&gt;PLUS IT HAS A 30 SPF WHICH IS FAR BETTER THAN&lt;br /&gt;THE MOISTURIZER I WAS USING.&lt;br /&gt;I WOULD BUY IT AGAIN.</li>
            <li> This product clearly works well for a lot of people. That being said, we are all different so I&#x27;ll give my two cents:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have *extremely* sensitive skin. This product was not for me. It made my face red, blotchy and itchy. Just a word of warning to those of you with sensitive skin - this might not be the product for you.</li>
            <li> The product I received wasn&#x27;t light and felt greasy. I can&#x27;t say I noticed a difference in the evenness of my complexion, although I didn&#x27;t buy it for that reason.</li>
            <li> This is a perfect replacement for Neutrogena&#x27;s Ageless Essentials Continuous Hydration (daytime), which—like all good products—seems to have been discontinued. I am relieved to find it.</li>
            <li> Smells good, which is definitely a plus.  It&#x27;s a little thicker than what I expected, but it&#x27;s fine because it goes on well.  Easy to use and invisible.  Feels great on the skin as well.</li>
            <li> I have been using this lotion for about two weeks now and have been happy with it. I haven&#x27;t noticed a change in the evenness of my skin, but I like that it&#x27;s SPF 30 and not greasy. I did break out a little when I first started using it, but since then haven&#x27;t had any issues.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer would actually burn my skin a little in certain places, specifically the apples of my cheeks.  I think it was either the sunscreen or the dark spot reducing components that did this to my skin.  Otherwise I liked the texture, just disappointed.  I use the Neutrogena nighttime moisturizer and loved, and thought this would have been a similar experience.  After using this lotion a few times, I found that my cheeks hurt so much that I would wash off the lotion and to cool my face down would put on the nighttime version.</li>
            <li> I had used this for years, and then it disappeared and I was unable to find it anywhere (Couldn&#x27;t find to buy on the internet either!) I was very sad, I was unable to find anything that matched up to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently It came back and I am SO excited. As soon as I saw it, I grabbed it.&lt;br /&gt;I have rosacea, and before I had major signs of it, this would calm the redness and *spots* on my face. It made my skin look porcelain smooth (before... my skin turned into this mess of issues).&lt;br /&gt;I can say, MANY years later, that I am still in love with this and it is the best moisturizer that works with my rosacea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes away A LOT of redness and hydrates my skin without me breaking out. I haven&#x27;t been able to find anything that hydrates like this since my rosacea became much worse.&lt;br /&gt;I usually have issues with spf (as I have allergic reactions) but this never seems to bother me. This is very gentle, works well, and is worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This moisturizer has been my lifesaver for years, not even the 40-50$ moisturizers I tried out beat this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have NOTHING but amazing things to say about this product.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really notice a difference other than the moisture.</li>
            <li> This product felt oily on my skin and caused more breakouts and redness than I had before using it.</li>
            <li> If you do not have patience do not bother to buy this.</li>
            <li> This is the first neutrogena product I bought after reading to the many awesome neutrogena reviews everywhere. I was so disappointed!&lt;br /&gt;Firstly, when I opened it from the box, it felt so light as though the tube is empty. As soon as I tried to squeeze the cream out, some clear oily liquid oozed out. Now from the consistency, I knew this is not the moisturizer so I decided to shake the tube thoroughly before trying again. This time some more oily liquid came out before the white thick moisturizer. I probably just received a faulty product because I couldn&#x27;t find any reviews with such an experience.&lt;br /&gt;Regardless, I tried to shake it again a lot more this time and then finally I got some well blended cream. Unfortunately, I saw an increase of pimples and oiliness on my forehead within 2 weeks of regularly applying this. I&#x27;m really sad I spent so much on this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy.  Skin care products are foreign territory but on a whim I bought this.  Yea it helps after shaving and I&#x27;m sure the SPF doesn&#x27;t hurt, but the &#x27;visibly even&#x27; part I think is a gimmick.  I wouldn&#x27;t say I need to even out my complexion but if I did, this would not be the tool for the job.</li>
            <li> I do like this moisturizer.  It is light enough to wear under makeup and it also give you the SPF30 you need.  I will order again.</li>
            <li> still awaiting for outcome</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer for dark skin</li>
            <li> I use Neutrogena Visible Even Daily, SPF30  moisturizer for many years, every day. It is  not heavy, not clogging pores,smooth, no smell,  fast  absorbing, easy to use make up - foundation/concealer over it.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for a moisturizer for daily use and came across the Visibly Even line. I decided to give it a try and see how my skin fared. After a week, I noticed that some uneven skin tone left by acne marks had begun to fade. Within a few weeks, my skin was looking better then I can ever remember. This moisturizer is truly a miracle worker. I apply it each morning and honestly could not be happier with the results. Don&#x27;t be put off by the price. Give it a shot, it&#x27;s by far the best skin care product I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> This is great moisturizer. Has SPF for daytime, and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy. I normally buy this locally, this was a good price at the time, so purchased online.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent sunscreen and makeup base. It cnotains helioplex, recommended by my dermatologist. I am a longtime, very satisfied consumer of Neutrogena skin products, and this is one of my daily favorites.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try and smooth over some of my hyperpigmentation and acne scars with this but it just made me break out and over produce oil. Not fun. It irritated my skin a bit as well.</li>
            <li> My skin is getting more sensitive with age, so I have to give up most of my regular moisturizers, especially with SPF ones. This Neutrogena product works very well. It&#x27;s light and doesn&#x27;t have that SPF scent.</li>
            <li> Love the other neutrogena products, but this one really irritates my eyes even if I don&#x27;t put near my eyes  - sweat makes it get in. I never have had issues with moisturizers and eye issues. Not buying again, but going back to Neutrogena Healthy skin.</li>
            <li> Its great! I have really dry patches that this moisturizes but does not make my skin oily like others do</li>
            <li> This is my second time using this product.  I was pleased with the results the first time, that I decided to use it again.  The second time, I experienced a burning sensation, along with several breakouts.! I&#x27;m not sure exactly what caused the breakout to develop. It could be that my skin is now rejecting the ingredients that are in this &amp;#34;moisturizer&amp;#34;.  I have dry skin, and I find that after use of this product, my skin has become somewhat drier than before.  I won&#x27;t be purchasing this product again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find decent non-comedogenic sunscreen for skin that&#x27;s medium to dark in tone. I&#x27;m satisfied with this one!</li>
            <li> I have been using this moisturizer on a daily basis for a little over a month now. It smells nice and is not greasy. I have naturally oily skin and large pores, and I do feel that my skin has been looking less shiny and clearer since using this. I am 31 years old and have started getting dark spots on my face, sort of like large freckles, which I hear people call age or sun spots. I&#x27;m not sure if this has actually lightened them or that I am just hoping that it has, but I do feel that my skin has a more overall even tone, and looks brighter which is great because I had been feeling like my complexion had become a bit dull for at least this last year now. So far, I do like it and would recommend it to anyone wanting a smoother and glowing complexion.</li>
            <li> So light and smells great! It does its job.</li>
            <li> For 2 years prior to using this moisturizer, I had been using a very nice (and very expensive) daily moisturizer from Sephora. But my wallet groaned every time I had to buy a new tube, so after reading reviews, I decided to try this. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week straight, and it seems like a decent moisturizer with some good positive aspects, but a couple glaring negative ones. Here they are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Feels light, a little dollop goes a long way, and my skin hasn&#x27;t broken out or gotten greasy after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: My nose and forehead are always quite shiny after application, and I usually have to dab around a bit with a towel to try and reduce that, which is a pain. The moisturizer also has a very distinct sunscreen smell, which I find unpleasant, since you can buy other SPF 15 products that hardly have any smell at all. And finally, I&#x27;ve noticed my eyes getting irritated soon after application of the product, even though I avoid my eye area and don&#x27;t rub at my eyes/face, meaning that the moisturizer has a migratory quality. That last point is the deal-breaker for me, and I think I am just going to suck it up and go back to paying three times as much for a moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t have these deficiencies.</li>
            <li> I was/am under-whelmed by this product. First off, I noticed that even when I shake it vigorously, the product separates, almost like sunscreen that has gone bad? It makes it messy to apply, and is generally kind of gross to look at, since it&#x27;s almost like an oily consistency. Secondly, I didn&#x27;t notice any improvements to my skin; product claims to even out your skin tone, but I didn&#x27;t notice even the faintest change to my complexion. There are better products on the market than this one.</li>
            <li> I put this on every day before foundation.  It goes on nicely and does not irritate my skin.  I like it.  Gotta have that SPF!</li>
            <li> Great product! Got it quickly.</li>
            <li> WOW,its great.I like how it protects my skin from the sun,and I&#x27;m starting to see the change in my skin.</li>
            <li> I have not really noticed a difference in my skin yet.  It appears to making my face more supple, but I think I need to give it a little more time.</li>
            <li> I love this. It goes on well and dose not make me sweat. I love in San Diego and it is really sunny all of the time so SPF is needed daily.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist suggested I put this moisturizer on daily during the summer. On hot and humid days, it gets into my eyes and stings. This happens hours after carefully applying it to my face. I even avoid my eye area, but it still seems to &amp;#34;melt&amp;#34; into my eyes. I will not buy it again.</li>
            <li> Adequate moisturizer and sunblock.  I still have age spots, but suspect if you use a sunblock daily brown spots will lighten and not increase.</li>
            <li> The best sunscreen hands down!</li>
            <li> Evens out my skin, even if it&#x27;s a little rosy.  Nice moisturizer with&lt;br /&gt;30 SPF.  Never leave home without it...</li>
            <li> Excellent high-SPF moisturizer. I don&#x27;t know about the &amp;#34;evening&amp;#34; effects, but my skin looks and feels good. Goes on very nice and silky, not greasy at all. Mild, pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!! I use the visibly even BB cream and thought I would give this a try as well. I have been using it for several months and I had a birth mark that grew due to the sun and it&#x27;s almost completely vanished!!</li>
            <li> As a teenager, I believed the lies that &amp;#34;some day&amp;#34; I would grow out of acne.  Imagine my surprise (and dismay) to find myself in my late 20s/early30s with both acne AND early wrinkles.  ???  I have olive, oily skin but am now old enough where teenage &amp;#34;acne&amp;#34; treatments dry my skin out too much....yet somehow still get acne...ugh.  I love this moisturizer because it is lightweight for my skin type yet moisturizing enough so my skin doesn&#x27;t feel dry (note for you jogging knuckleheads in upper USA: your facial skin will have micro-tears in winter if you run into the wind - if you find your face peeling during winter, and I know this sounds icky, stop using facial wash of any kind for 36 - 48 hrs...this should be long enough for the tears to heal; you can still wash your face with water).  I have adverse reactions to a lot of face &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; but rely on neutrogena for hypoallergenic and non-comedogenic products. And I can wear this moisterizer with NO MAKEUP into the outside world without feeling like I&#x27;m scaring small children.  I&#x27;m 29, plus or minus a few years.  :). I will be very, very sad if/when this product is discontinued.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer.. it really works. My acne marks fade and its keeps my skin smooth and vibrant. Please Neutrogena do not discontinue this product, I am finding it difficult to find in stores which lead me to Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big time fan of Neutrogena products. I have been using this moisturizer for about two years now and it&#x27;s better than anything I&#x27;ve used before. I&#x27;m really prone to breakouts with most the other products, even some Neutrogena moisturizers. Neutrogena Visibly Even is the first moisturizer that I don&#x27;t experience breakouts with. This one is not greasy at all, goes on nicely and absorbs very quickly. It doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel but I know it works because my skin feels much softer and better. Best part about it is the SPF 30, moisturizer and sunscreen in one! I use it for face and neck, wait about five minutes to let it absorb and then I put my make up on. No breakouts, no problems! Doesn&#x27;t get any better than this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a better moisturizer in my life! It conditions and moisturizes without leaving my skin feeling oily. In fact, my skin feels soft and even after putting it on and it actually is fading some old acne scars I&#x27;ve had since I was a teenager. Keep in mind, this has taken months of use, but I still see a definite difference. I highly recommend it, especially for women of color life myself.</li>
            <li> I really love this moisturizer.  I have oily skin, acne prone and this product isn&#x27;t oily at all!  It goes on very easily and spreads far so you don&#x27;t have to use a lot.  It really does even out my skin tone.  Unlike other moisturizers or sunscreens, an hour after I put it on my face isn&#x27;t completely shiny.  It makes my face very smooth, soft, and it definitely feels great!  I would recommend this to anyone looking for a light moisturizer.  This is a good one!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this moisturizer! I have tried much more expensive moisturizers, but this one is the best by far! The great thing about this Neutrogena product is that it has SPF 30, and it soaks into my slightly oily skin (and leaves it smelling nice and feeling very soft)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product...I am on my 4th or 5th bottle! :)</li>
            <li> I ordered the Neutrogena Visibly Even Daily Moisturizer with SPF Sunscreen for two main reasons. One, I like and recommend Neutrogena products, and two, I wanted sunscreen and moisturizer in one cream to simplify my morning routine.  This product met my expectations and I am very pleased with the feeling it leaves on my skin.  It is not oily and disappears into my skin leaving a nice feel and good foundation for my makeup.</li>
            <li> I give it a 5 just because it feels like nothing on my face and it actually smells pretty good. Makes my face feel better when it get really dry.</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE this Neutrogena product! It goes on easily and is quickly absorbed. Seriously, within just a few minutes my skin feels great to the touch, and has a much healthier look - it&#x27;s that good a moisturizer! I&#x27;ve been using Visibly Even Daily Moisturizer for about 10 weeks, and darker areas on my face are fading. A tube goes a long way, too - after 10 weeks of using this, I just this week opened my 2nd tube! A great product AND a great value. I am happier with this moisturizer than anything else I&#x27;ve tried. Bravo Neutrogena!</li>
            <li> This is a great product for darker skin with hyperpigmentation spots and patches.  I have combination skin (classic T-zone: oily forehead, nose, and chin and dry cheeks) and used to have dark spots and patches, mostly on my chin and cheeks.  Since using the Neutrogena Visibly Even Daily Moisturizer for the past 5 months, I have noticed an evening out of my skin tone and a fading of the darkness on my cheeks.  I&#x27;ve also noticed that my skin is softer and smoother than in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An added bonus is that this moisturizer doesn&#x27;t go on shiny.  It has a smooth, velvety texture that keeps my T-zone under control and serves as a good base for my make-up.  Even several hours after application, my skin still isn&#x27;t oily!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soy in this product, a natural skin brightener, works to smooth and soften the skin while the SPF protects your skin from further sun damage.  This combination of moisturizing, brightening and protecting over time leads to glowing, healthier-looking skin.  I use this along with the Neutrogena Visibly Even Foaming Cleanser every day and pray this line never gets discontinued!</li>
            <li> This product is great, packaging was changed this year if that helps you too! I luv it, so creamy &amp; effective, gets me thru 18 holes of golfing, only a second application if it&#x27;s rea..lly hot or sweating profusely...have used for 6 years, the best sunscreen/skin care I have found!</li>
            <li> This stuff is good. I didn&#x27;t really realize it was until one day everybody started telling me \\&quot;I&#x27;m glowing\\&quot;. I&#x27;m told I&#x27;m glowing all the time, I thought it was just an ovulation glow-- you know, nature&#x27;s way of telling the opposite sex we&#x27;re fertile and ready, lol. But nope, I realize its the Neutrogena (although I am all those first things too ;-) ).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last time I had a bottle of this I used it sporadically, this time, since I now have a 8am-5pm corporate job (more like 6am-6:30pm), I use it every day. This consistency makes a difference. I put it on under my makeup in the mornings. I&#x27;ll also reapply if I go out to an event after work-- I&#x27;ll put on some more moisturizer and a little more makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m finding that I need way less makeup, but to be honest I never used much to begin with anyway. I can see why Gabrielle Union looks like she&#x27;s 25 at the age of 40. I think for great skin, if you have normal skin like me, then this stuff + lots of water will have you \\&quot;glowing\\&quot; all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;:::MY SKIN:::&lt;br /&gt;- Type: normal&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Complexion: dark brown&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Skin Routine: I&#x27;ve never really done much, growing up I just used Noxema. All my family has smooth skin though (and we all just used Noxema). I never put anything on my skin, but that. However after going to a spa last year I was told I should use something different so I&#x27;ve tried a few different things (dermalogica, bliss, etc) and laid off the Noxema (still not sure if that was the right choice).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Diet: average American diet maybe-- try to eat healthy, but I&#x27;ll have the occasional fast food and extra chocolate chip cookies, lol. I&#x27;m working on eating very clean. Let&#x27;s just call it right now-- one day soon I will consistently only eat very clean... Gotta honor our temples right, lol :-)</li>
            <li> Love it for the protection but the smell is so off putting and smells too much like sunscreen. I thought it would be a bit more pleasant on the face</li>
            <li> I used this product during the winter months as it is a little thick but it does even your skin.</li>
            <li> I keep ordering it. It does help minimize spots. Absorbs completely. Feels nice.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for some daily sun protection. I use a bunch of different acne products on my face so it&#x27;s always pretty dry. I was using Aveeno positively radiant but I like this much better. There is no noticeable fragrance (I&#x27;m a  guy) and it leaves my skin feeling really moisturized. I can&#x27;t say much about the reduction in discoloration yet, I&#x27;ll add more on that in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I was excited when I found this moisturizer with great reviews with great price.&lt;br /&gt;My skin combination type of skin doesn&#x27;t normally break out nor have allergy reaction to skincare products. So it took me by surprise that at my first application of the product, red spots with itchy and burning sensation occurred. Despite all wonderful reviews about this moisturizer, it doesn&#x27;t work for me unfortunately. I had to wash my face to reduce the itchiness. And the little I know, the break out followed after. I had to return the product.</li>
            <li> Update: This is disappointing to write but I have to be honest and say any effect this had on my skin tone came and went within the first 2 weeks of using it. It evened my overall facial skin tone a bit and I thought that would continue but it did not. Just kept on with the half fast job for months up until tonight when I finished the bottle. (June 5th 2015) I initially purchased this product because I found a cure for my acne and needed a way to rush the healing of the acne scars that were left behind. I&#x27;m sad to say that this did nothing for that. It&#x27;s been months now and the scars are still there healing at the same pace they would had I not purchased this product in the first place. the wash and the moisturizer say it takes up to 8 weeks to see results on dark marks and those 8 weeks are long gone by now and i&#x27;m left feeling cheated. It did not make me break out. I guess that&#x27;s a plus  Original Review: Important facts: I have only been using this for 2 weeks I use this with the cleanser of the same name. I am a 22 year old African American girl  Review I sought out a product to rid me of my acne scars after finally finding a cure for my acne. This has yet to rid me of them but it says it takes 8 weeks to do so. Why am I  prematurely writing this review you ask? Well, it&#x27;s because I am profoundly impressed with the results I&#x27;ve seen in just 2 weeks. My uneven skin tone has almost disappeared, and my skin is smoother than it has ever been.  I can only imagine that this will continue. I will give another update at the end of my eight week trial. Lets hope for the best!  Cons: A little dose not go a long way: The container is very small and it is not the most hydrating of moisturizers. My skin is dry after I wash it so I end up using a lot more of this product than I thought I&#x27;d need. However, the light moisturizer leaves your skin feeling clean and your pores unclogged so I think a bigger container would be a sufficient enough change. That way I can use all I needand not feel like I constantly need to spend money on a new tube.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m African American and this works well on my skin</li>
            <li> I mostly like Neutrogena brand items. However, this does not adequately moisturize my skin.  I now mix it with my Cerave moisturizer to get the SPF benefits and not waste my money. This also has a fragrance that gives me a slight headache.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a moisturizer with SPF - not much more to say. It seems to last 3-4 months for me applying once per day, but I don&#x27;t put it on very thick. I&#x27;m not sure I can really notice a &amp;#34;visibly even&amp;#34; smoothing effect. It&#x27;s a bit of a stretch if so, so take that with a grain of salt. I doubt one could prove either way. The SPF 30 is nice and that is the main appeal to me, so I&#x27;m on my 3rd tube.</li>
            <li> I use this product almost every day. So thats about four months now. At first I didn&#x27;t and then stop using it for a while but I&#x27;m back to using it. I have been using it on and off since purchase date, mostly on but I have to say I have seen no improvement in my skin. I haven&#x27;t seen it even out my skin tone or anything which is sad to say cause I hope it would have worked. Also I find that for some reason there&#x27;s this liquid that is separating itself from the actual product. It&#x27;s kinda of oily and I have to shake it up a bit. I don&#x27;t know if its because the whether is hot because I live in the Caribbean. I just don&#x27;t know. It very moisturizing on my face though and leaves my face feeling very soft after application. Oh yeah and it makes me sweat like crazy! But I don&#x27;t use it that much if I know I&#x27;m going to be active that day. It&#x27;s just an okay product.. Was hoping it would have been better.</li>
            <li> It was great as a regular moisturizer, but did not even my skin tone at all.  Without that, it&#x27;s hardly worth the price.</li>
