            <li>This worked beautifully!</li>
            <li>but i may just be a wimp lol</li>
            <li>It is really awesome, and I&#x27;ve used it twice :-)</li>
            <li>but it is a good item</li>
            <li>Worked good.  </li>
            <li>It did not work great, but it was better than nothing at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just wish there was more product for the money.</li>
            <li>There are a lot better products out there.</li>
            <li>It works and i did put two more earrings all alone.  </li>
            <li>It was the best 6 bucks I ever spent</li>
            <li>I used it before sugar waxing my under arms and it works very well, not as well with the bikini area but still good</li>
            <li>Went on easily was in about 90 minutes</li>
            <li>I just tried this for my tattoo and it works fine.</li>
            <li>I got a huge tattoo on my chest and used the cream on the sternum you wrap it in plastic and</li>
            <li>I like it very much!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>Worked pretty well.</li>
            <li>got it really fast!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take away the full pain, but definitely reduces the pain tremendously.</li>
            <li>I wish it is cheaper in price or bigger in size , other than that it works great for me.</li>
            <li>Followed the directions on the box and the discomfort was MUCH lower.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Needed this so I can bear electrolysis a little better.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised it really works, althought I felt some pain, but not equivalent to one without numbing the earlobes.</li>
            <li>its ok but its small</li>
            <li>I had a Brazilian wax and only felt pressure where the cream was directly applied.</li>

            <li> I haven&#x27;t worn earrings in a long time, and it really hurt trying to insert a thick pair.</li>
            <li> Extra bonus is that the cream base is fragrance free and did not irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> about 45 min later it&#x27;s super numb</li>
            <li> and I tried it a few different times.</li>
            <li> Super numb does not do what it claims not worth the money or the rating.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t feel a damn thing it last for at least an hour</li>
            <li> This product sucks it is a wast of money</li>
            <li> It takes hours and the entire tube to numb.</li>
            <li> I bought this to numb my daughters back</li>
            <li> doesnt numb as well as it is described to do even following the directions to a tee.</li>
            <li> Not a good buy at all.</li>
            <li> I sat through a six hour tattoo with VERY LITTLE pain, and I am a wimp!!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t numb your skin that well.</li>
            <li> Followed instructions didn&#x27;t numb at all!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Used it for a calf tattoo. Worked well. Went on easily was in about 90 minutes give it a try</li>
            <li> This product sucks it is a wast of money does not even work at all! I will not be ordering it again.</li>
            <li> its ok but its small I should have bought 2 and not jest one but it is a good item</li>
            <li> It was the best 6 bucks I ever spent I got a huge tattoo on my chest and used the cream on the sternum you wrap it in plastic and about 45 min later it&#x27;s super numb I couldn&#x27;t feel a damn thing it last for at least an hour then it starts to ware off but it&#x27;s definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all... tried it several times and never got anything out of it. Not a good buy at all.</li>
            <li> Needed this so I can bear electrolysis a little better.  Followed the directions on the box and the discomfort was MUCH lower. Extra bonus is that the cream base is fragrance free and did not irritate my sensitive skin. I just wish there was more product for the money.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t numb your skin that well. It takes hours and the entire tube to numb. There are a lot better products out there.</li>
            <li> I just tried this for my tattoo and it works fine. I like this cream I would recommend this to people.</li>

            <li> I bought this to numb my daughters back did not work I don&#x27;t think I will buy it again .</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why, but this just didn&#x27;t work for me. I got it to use with a derma roller and I tried it a few different times. It just didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I used this product while doing an in-home brazilian. Worked pretty well. It doesn&#x27;t take away the full pain, but definitely reduces the pain tremendously. Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Simply because it works as stated. I had a Brazilian wax and only felt pressure where the cream was directly applied. It is really awesome, and I&#x27;ve used it twice :-)</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t worn earrings in a long time, and it really hurt trying to insert a thick pair. I put the cream at 11:30 and tried the earrings at 14:10.  I&#x27;m surprised it really works, althought I felt some pain, but not equivalent to one without numbing the earlobes.</li>
            <li> I like it very much! It works and i did put two more earrings all alone.  I would recommend it to all that do not like pain!</li>
            <li> doesnt numb as well as it is described to do even following the directions to a tee. but i may just be a wimp lol</li>
            <li> This worked beautifully! I sat through a six hour tattoo with VERY LITTLE pain, and I am a wimp!! I would buy this again, use it again, and tell all my friends about it!</li>
            <li> Worked good.  It did not work great, but it was better than nothing at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got it really fast!</li>
            <li> would&#x27;nt wast my time on this stuff doesn&#x27;t work, I&#x27;d check around for 5 stars before I would buy this</li>
            <li> I wish it is cheaper in price or bigger in size , other than that it works great for me. I used it before sugar waxing my under arms and it works very well, not as well with the bikini area but still good</li>
