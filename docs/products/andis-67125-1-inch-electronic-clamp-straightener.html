            <li>I still looked like a little kid with puffy hair, but now my hair is straight, longer, and more healthy looking.</li>
            <li>I recently ordered this hair straightener, and was satisfied with the results after using it.</li>
            <li>it is too hot and burned my hair.</li>
            <li>I used this starightener for the first time this morning</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and it leaves it straight and soft in one pass.</li>
            <li>my hair did turn out pretty straight though &amp; really shiny.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair, so I only use up to 5.  &lt;</li>
            <li>I had ordered this item really wanting it</li>
            <li>I use it on my 8 yrs-old daughter , her hair stays straight for almost a week .</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Why straighten what is already straight?</li>

            <li>The straightener works very well.</li>

            <li>I HIGHLY reccomend this to everyone!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never tried any other brands, but this one was cheap and certainly does the trick.</li>
            <li>i HIGHLY recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I Highly Recommend This Straightener.</li>
            <li>i have to say i love this little thing.</li>
            <li>Having naturally curly hair, had given up hope of ever achieving the straight look, until I purchased this product.</li>
            <li>There is a red indicator light when it&#x27;s on, and a green indicator light that turns off when the desired temperature is reached.</li>
            <li>I have used several high end flat irons in the past and this one is just as good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I am glad I purchased this product as my previous Hot Tools straightener was extremely damaging to my hair</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very hot so be careful.</li>
            <li>Plus it only takes a minute or two because I don&#x27;t have that much hair.</li>
            <li>And I don&#x27;t have to go over the same section over and over the whole time.</li>
            <li>I was surprised that this compairs to my hot tools which I had to replace due to</li>
            <li>My new hair stylist recommended this flat iron.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;what!\\&quot; anyways, the only thing i didn&#x27;t really like about this straightener was that it left my ends feeling kinda dry.</li>
            <li>so it gets pretty frizzy when there is a little humidity.  </li>
            <li>My hair dresser even asked me how I got my hair so straight, because she wasn&#x27;t able to with her very expensive \\&quot;salon\\&quot; straightener.  </li>
            <li>With this little wonder, the time it takes to straighten had been cut by a third (I really do have a lot of hair).</li>

            <li> Heats up fast and since its so small you can get all the way to the roots.</li>
            <li> I am 20-years and before using using this flat iron</li>
            <li> Anyone can use this flat iron.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used flat irons that cost over $100, and this one worked just as well for under $20!  </li>
            <li> so my arms would get tired really quickly.</li>
            <li> I will NEVER use ANOTHER flat iron again!!</li>
            <li> I have very stubborn hair, rather thick and wavy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used one other straightener before, and it was so ineffective, that I have not tried another, until I read the reviews for this one.</li>
            <li> I did have a few stubborn sections of hair, but they only needed a second slower pass.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably not best for me because I have lots of thick hair, but if you really don&#x27;t feel like spending a lot of money on a straightener, have thin hair,  or are not going to use it very often, this would be the right item for you.</li>
            <li> the only thing is that since i use it everyday, my ends split and gets really dry.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick, curly hair &amp; it works very well on it.  </li>
            <li> I imagine that if you have normal to thin hair with some wave to it, it would take less than 10 minutes to do your hair.</li>
            <li> And for less than 20 bucks you get a quality product that works.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ll have to try not to use it everyday.  </li>
            <li> The biggest problem I&#x27;ve had with those is a HORRIBLE burning smell from the vida sassoon, all 3 tended to rip my hair out (catching on screws and in clamps), and all 3 burned my scalp while I tried to get to the roots.</li>
            <li> I have really thick hair and with my previous Revlon straighener</li>
            <li> The big thick plates, thin ones, you name it...</li>
            <li> it stay shiny with very little frizz.  </li>
            <li> I had purchased inexpensive irons in the past and always got what I paid for.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t straighten often enough to justify purchasing an expensive iron.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t go out and buy an expensive one.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> This flat iron is the best flat iron that I have ever used!!!! My hair has never been this straight before!! I am 20-years and before using using this flat iron I still looked like a little kid with puffy hair, but now my hair is straight, longer, and more healthy looking. Anyone can use this flat iron. It is so easy to use and it gets deep in the roots without worries about getting burned!!</li>
            <li> my aunt let me use hers last night &amp; i must say that i was pretty satisfied with the results. when i found out you could get it for like $20 i was like, \\&quot;what!\\&quot; anyways, the only thing i didn&#x27;t really like about this straightener was that it left my ends feeling kinda dry. my hair did turn out pretty straight though &amp; really shiny. hm...</li>
            <li> I love this straightener.  Its the perfect size and helps make my hair look great with ease and adds great shine as well.</li>
            <li> I am so pleasently surprized by this.  I had purchased inexpensive irons in the past and always got what I paid for.  I don&#x27;t straighten often enough to justify purchasing an expensive iron.  I am so glad I gave this a chance.</li>
            <li> awesome for its price. its gets the job done (stated above). i HIGHLY recommend this product. fast shipping as well. &#x3D;]</li>
            <li> I had ordered this item really wanting it yet I did not get it in the shipping, was lack of my address info and I had called customer service and had right on the spot help and refunded as well as very Helpful CS! Thank you Amazon!</li>
            <li> I got this straightener a month or so ago. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I love it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;it straightens my hair &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;and keeps it that way &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;this straightener&#x3D;LOVE. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I like how you can chose the temperature settings. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It works way better than the conair i had before. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;]]</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used one other straightener before, and it was so ineffective, that I have not tried another, until I read the reviews for this one. It actually worked. I have very stubborn hair, rather thick and wavy. I just used it today, and right now I have very smooth, pretty hair. I am very pleased with this straightener!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s works excellent !!I recommend this product, very cheap. I use it on my 8 yrs-old daughter , her hair stays straight for almost a week . it heats a lot so I use it at minimun heat</li>
            <li> This is a really great product. I have used several high end flat irons in the past and this one is just as good. I have fine hair and it leaves it straight and soft in one pass. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I recently ordered this hair straightener, and was satisfied with the results after using it. It&#x27;s probably not best for me because I have lots of thick hair, but if you really don&#x27;t feel like spending a lot of money on a straightener, have thin hair,  or are not going to use it very often, this would be the right item for you. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Pros: &lt;br /&gt;Size, convenient for straightening bangs. &lt;br /&gt;Quick heat up. &lt;br /&gt;Price. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Cons: &lt;br /&gt;Not amazingly effective but for the price you can&#x27;t complain much. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am glad I purchased this product as my previous Hot Tools straightener was extremely damaging to my hair and I pretty much just needed a quick cheap replacement, which will do for now.</li>
            <li> Because I have very fine, straight hair it never would have occurred to me to use a straightener. Why straighten what is already straight? However, a friend with similar hair recommended it and I have to say the results are incredible - like I&#x27;ve just had it cut and styled at a salon. Plus it only takes a minute or two because I don&#x27;t have that much hair. I&#x27;ve never tried any other brands, but this one was cheap and certainly does the trick. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Having naturally curly hair, had given up hope of ever achieving the straight look, until I purchased this product.</li>
            <li> Its really great. Heats up fast and since its so small you can get all the way to the roots. I love it! I will NEVER use ANOTHER flat iron again!! I have found THE ONE!!! Thanks Andies!!!</li>
            <li> I was surprised that this compairs to my hot tools which I had to replace due to it is too hot and burned my hair. I am glad I found this.</li>
            <li> my hair is fine so it gets pretty frizzy when there is a little humidity.  but using this straightener, my hair goes all day.  it stay shiny with very little frizz.  the only thing is that since i use it everyday, my ends split and gets really dry.  i&#x27;ll have to try not to use it everyday.  don&#x27;t go out and buy an expensive one.  this one will do just as good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned 2 conairs and a vidal sassoon before this one. The biggest problem I&#x27;ve had with those is a HORRIBLE burning smell from the vida sassoon, all 3 tended to rip my hair out (catching on screws and in clamps), and all 3 burned my scalp while I tried to get to the roots. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This one is PERFECT! I got it at walmart for $14.99, it has a 5-year warranty, and it just works great! There is a red indicator light when it&#x27;s on, and a green indicator light that turns off when the desired temperature is reached. I can get right to the roots and haven&#x27;t burnt my scalp yet! It&#x27;s design is amazing so there is nowhere to catch your hair on. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;BUY THIS STRAIGHTENER!</li>
            <li> i have to say i love this little thing. i have it over a month now and i use it every day and love it. it warms up realy quickly and does the job. the way it&#x27;s build your hair doesnt get stuck in it . get it.</li>
            <li> The Straightener was shipped fast within the date amazon said it would be recieved. The straightener works very well. I&#x27;m a happy customer. &#x3D;]</li>
            <li> This is an awesome straightener. I gor it at wal-mart for $15, used it for the first time this morning and love it. I have really thick hair and with my previous Revlon straighener it took me forever to straighten my hair. I had to go over the same section several times and it had some weight to it so my arms would get tired really quickly. With this little wonder, the time it takes to straighten had been cut by a third (I really do have a lot of hair). And I don&#x27;t have to go over the same section over and over the whole time. I did have a few stubborn sections of hair, but they only needed a second slower pass. I imagine that if you have normal to thin hair with some wave to it, it would take less than 10 minutes to do your hair. My hair didn&#x27;t get caught in this one like my last one either, and it&#x27;s very light and easy to handle. I will definitely be straightening my hair a lot more with this available to me.</li>
            <li> I bought this straightner at Walmart for about the same price found on amazon and I really like it.  I bought it mostly to curl my hair like my stylist does.  I wanted a chi, but I couldn&#x27;t pass this one up for the price.  I &#x27;ve only used it a couple of times but it straightens well and can be used to curl my hair as well.  A good product for the price!!!</li>
            <li> I love this straightener!!  I have very thick, curly hair &amp; it works very well on it.  I recommend this to anyone looking for a cheap straightener.</li>
            <li> I have tried multiple straighteners for my curly hair.  The big thick plates, thin ones, you name it...I got this based on some of the other reviews, and am SO happy I did.  My hair is short, so this works perfectly for it.  My hair dresser even asked me how I got my hair so straight, because she wasn&#x27;t able to with her very expensive \\&quot;salon\\&quot; straightener.  I HIGHLY reccomend this to everyone!</li>
            <li> I used this starightener for the first time this morning and I&#x27;m completely satisfied with it! It doesn&#x27;t leave crimps in your hair from the ceramic plates and it leaves your hair very smooth and shiny. I have relatively fine hair and it straightened it really quick!</li>
            <li> Ive Owned SEVERAL Straigteners, But This Is By Far The Best One Ive Purchased. My Hair Is So Silky, Smooth, And VERY Straight After Using It. It Doesnt Seem To Do Any Damage To My Hair At All. I Plan On Ordering 2 More Soon For Relatives. &#x3D;) I Highly Recommend This Straightener.</li>
            <li> My new hair stylist recommended this flat iron. I got it at Walmart for about $15. &lt;br /&gt;Some nice features: &lt;br /&gt;- Heats up almost immediately. &lt;br /&gt;- Very easy to handle. &lt;br /&gt;- 20 heat settings. I have fine hair, so I only use up to 5.  &lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s very hot so be careful. I suggest start with a lower setting, then increase to your liking. &lt;br /&gt;- And for less than 20 bucks you get a quality product that works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used flat irons that cost over $100, and this one worked just as well for under $20!  It&#x27;s light and easy to handle, and there are no parts that will snag your hair.  I&#x27;ve never even heard of Andis, but now I know they make a great flat iron.</li>
