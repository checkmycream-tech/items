            <li>I get compliments on how smooth my face looks, almost flawless...</li>
            <li>I have loved and used it ever since that time.  </li>
            <li>really good</li>
            <li>I tried this product after reading some reviews that it is a good moisturizer/coverup for men.  </li>
            <li>but I have got quite good skin.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m good to go.</li>
            <li>I just love that scent! :P</li>
            <li>Amazon had a great price and free shipping was a plus!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The product does feel greasy when you first apply it, but once it dries after about two minutes it leaves a wonderful matte finish to your skin.</li>
            <li>I love and have used it for years!</li>
            <li>and I fell in love with it!  </li>
            <li>Love!</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using This primer for about 3 years now &amp; I LOVE it!</li>
            <li>So don&#x27;t use so much!!!!!  </li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t make my skin feel amazing plus</li>
            <li>I just smiled &amp; said thank-you.</li>
            <li>This product fits the bill nicely.</li>
            <li>It gives you a nice glow to your skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 38 and have nice but oily skin.  </li>
            <li>Kind of reminds me of glue, lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use this every day, its the perfect primer, it goes on wet and dries smooth, the best primer to use before foundation, cannot put make up on without it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used about every primer out there, &amp; this is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li>The directions say to give it two minutes, but honestly, you should give it more like 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this product!</li>
            <li>It does a great job of disguising pores, softening any fine lines, lessening shine, and giving a more even, smooth look.</li>
            <li>I loved it for myself!&lt;br /&gt;However, the smell kind of put me off at first.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a very nice primer, the first I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>My skin is highly sensitive though, very fair</li>
            <li>Philosophy the present is an excellent product.</li>
            <li>The tacky consistency makes this product a PERFECT makeup primer, especially for oily skin.</li>
            <li>I wear a light liquid foundation over it when I go to work; use it on its own on the weekends.  </li>
            <li>Oh, and it smells FABULOUS!  </li>
            <li>so I guess that makes it okay to post a review.  </li>
            <li>I do have to blot my face in the afternoon, but that&#x27;s just my oily skin, and I would rather blot than pile more powder on.  </li>
            <li>I promise your makeup will go on better and stay fresher longer if you use this product according to directions.  </li>
            <li>Love love this stuff, Would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li>Amazon is awesome for offering the subscribe and save as it knocks a couple dollars off of the standard price.  </li>
            <li>Also the EWGT rates this product as a 3 (one a scale of 0 to 10) which is a plus as it doesn&#x27;t contain as many chemicals as many of the products out there.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>But I mostly bought it to kept my under-eye concealer in place..</li>
            <li>I love this pre-makeup cream.  </li>
            <li>This moisturizer is the best yet, it is smooth, not oily and you don&#x27;t even need a powder to complete it.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t do powder b/c most powders make my face feel itchy but just use something that matches ur skin then ur g2g.</li>
            <li>it just makes ur skin look better</li>
            <li>Love Phiosophy, just not this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just OK.  </li>
            <li>LOVE</li>
            <li>Satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>and I LOVE the product \\&quot;The</li>
            <li>I have had and used better primer for my face.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff even though it does make me look ashy.</li>
            <li>Most wait before applying makeup.</li>
            <li>I love this.  </li>
            <li>I needed a primer that was healthy for my skin, would not clog pores but would hide them, and that would give me an airbrushed look.  </li>
            <li>My makeup just looks better using this too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I instantly purchased and very happy with it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m always in the market for a better one to show up.</li>
            <li>This is not something you want on your skin if you&#x27;re going to be out in the sun as it causes photosensitivity... or in layman&#x27;s terms, possibly more sun spots.</li>
            <li>Personally, I love it.  </li>
            <li>I may or may not repurchase because I have better primers much better suited to my combination skin.</li>
            <li>get more than what you pay for, for sure.</li>
            <li>May be better for the summer months.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I was also very excited to try this primer.</li>
            <li>It is a pretty good primer, if you&#x27;re looking for one.  </li>
            <li>I will most definitely use this for special occasions under my foundation when I want to look flawless!  </li>
            <li>I LOVE Philosophy &amp; thought I&#x27;d LOVE the Present too (&amp; the price was GREAT), but it didn&#x27;t hold up to my expectations.  </li>
            <li>easy to remove at night with your selected beauty regemin cleanser.  </li>
            <li>Strongly recommend this to people with problem skin like mine.</li>
            <li>Minerals being the other option, are better, but lack the coverage that I&#x27;d ideally like.</li>
            <li>I find that using this primer helps my T-zone stay much more matte during a full day of work and afterwards.  </li>
            <li>It minimizes the appearance of fine line and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>because the lavender oil can cause break-outs, but it seems totally fine on my face.</li>
            <li>The first time I wore it (under a powder foundation), I had family members compliment me on how different and perfect my skin looked.</li>
            <li>No build up in wrinkles and it really makes my skin look better!</li>
            <li>I applied it, the consistancy was good liked that, let it dry over the 2 minutes and then applied my foundation.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best primer I have found so far.</li>
            <li>This product does what it says and very cost effective</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re much thinner, set up faster and provide a nice canvas for makeup.</li>
            <li>After I put this on I put a light layer of translucent powder from bamboo wear.</li>
            <li>This glides on your face smoothly and evenly and makes your skin silky smooth.  </li>
            <li>I urge anyone who has a makeup free complexion to give this a try.</li>
            <li>It feels so smooth on my face.  </li>
            <li>Makes me appear poreless and wrinkle free</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it is the product itself or it just doesn&#x27;t fit well with my skin.</li>
            <li>Just light pats with a tissue or cotton pad to pick up an excess.</li>
            <li>Smells and feels great, applies nicely enough</li>
            <li>It makes my skin have a smooth finish.</li>
            <li>It does such a good job that most days</li>
            <li>It is a clear make-up and good for the skin.</li>
            <li>After a whole day my makeup looks much better with The Present underneath than without; my makeup &amp;#34;sticks&amp;#34; longer, and before I had problems that my forehead and nose-area would become very oily but this products has reduced that which makes me very happy!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Other than this small issue this is a wonderful product!</li>
            <li>Nice and thick covers nicely and has nice scent.  </li>
            <li>It is worth the wait time!</li>
            <li>Specially in the cheeks and chin area.</li>
            <li>I feel that it is a good value - my last bottle lasted about 3 years.</li>
            <li>texture is cool.</li>
            <li>You MUST give it the full 2 minutes to set before applying makeup.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s good enough to wear alone</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t break me out; it feels great on my skin; it seals in my moisturizer, sunscreen and dark spot fade cream (my medicine layer), and then I put this on, waiting the full 2 minutes for it to set, which is important.  </li>
            <li>This is the perfect primer... minimizes pores, controls shine, glues my foundation onto my face... which means no more makeup meltdown!</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for quite a while now, and, while everyone is entitled to their own opinion, there are some things that are important to know if you want to reap the full benefits of The Present.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s a great primer.</li>
            <li>I think it would work best on those who wear mineral powder foundation or no makeup at all, needing just a subtle improvement.  </li>
            <li>I feel more confident about my appearance when I wear it, because I don&#x27;t look like I have makeup on, but my face looks smoother and younger.</li>
            <li>It shipped and arrived at my door quickly.</li>
            <li>I will do an experiment to see if there is really a tremendous difference between this and something else.</li>
            <li>I mean, it&#x27;s not absolutely terrible, but it&#x27;s not that great either.</li>
            <li>I have been hunting for a good under makeup primer for a long time.</li>
            <li>It does an excellent job as a primer, as long as you let it set up for several minutes.</li>
            <li>It is very lightweight, but it does fill in those fine lines.</li>
            <li>I still use Skindinavia, &amp; I&#x27;m sure that helps makeup stay put as well, but The Present has made a HUGE difference.  </li>
            <li>I just love this clear makeup mostly b/c it fells and looks so natural on me.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly under makeup and gives makeup appear more like an  air brushed look.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth the price..</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve never had success with this.</li>
            <li>I love this natural looking makeup.  </li>
            <li>It keeps my makeup fresh looking longer.</li>
            <li>Stick with one thin layer and be a beautiful you!</li>
            <li>Philosophy products are over priced but this one is worth its price.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much of it - just apply to clean skin.</li>
            <li>Since starting with The Present, I have changed to a layer of this.. and some powder on top for a nice matte finish.  </li>
            <li>and it is okay if you want a really bare face,</li>
            <li>Ok for a primer, kind of thick and sticky.</li>
            <li>This is also a great price for this product compared to buying it in more expensive makeup stores.</li>
            <li>I will still use Smashbox for important days, and just use this for other days until I run out, but I won&#x27;t be buying more.</li>
            <li>and I like the present much more)</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t speak to pore minimizing, but that wasn&#x27;t what I was interested in.</li>
            <li>I was introduced to this product at a local sephora store about 2 years ago and have been in love ever since.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a real winner!</li>
            <li>The only place that I found it was ok was on my eyelids, nose, cheeks and on forehead but not too close to my hairline or eyebrows.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE Philosophy&#x27;s The Present!  </li>
            <li>It recommends 2 full minutes, but that wasn&#x27;t long enough, in my opinion, so I wait 5 minutes (sometimes longer) &amp; my foundation looks perfect all day long.  </li>
            <li>This really does work!</li>
            <li>I have been an avid foundation wearer..</li>
            <li>Definitely a no no.. makes for a more rubbery look and feel.  </li>
            <li>First of all, maybe it&#x27;s just me</li>
            <li>Willing to bet people with issues didn&#x27;t follow the directions.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li>Light and not heavy.</li>
            <li>I love The Present....</li>
            <li>I end up wasting a bit because I inevitably end up squeezing out more than I need.</li>
            <li>A lot of product for a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;I will be buying this again!</li>
            <li>I really wanted to LOVE it and used it consistently for a couple of weeks trying different methods of application, time, etc...  </li>
            <li>I had much more success with Covergirl Simply Ageless Serum primer w/Olay and Sally Hansen Natural Beauty Luminizing Face Primer.</li>
            <li>the first time I applied it, I used too much...</li>
            <li>Usually philosophy products from amazon are just as good as those from sephora or even philosophy itself but not this time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first primer that I&#x27;ve tried, and it doesn&#x27;t really make that much of a difference in my skin or makeup application/</li>
            <li>And (2), it can make my dry skin flakey; however, I compensate by using a good moisturizer before applying The Present.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 46, still prone to a breakout now and then, large pores, and very oily skin.  </li>
            <li>In short, it&#x27;s a good primer, and it does help my bare minerals stay on a little longer than with other primers, but it isn&#x27;t as great as he was doting over it in his video.</li>
            <li>Outside of that, once I put it on it made my skin very shiny, NOT dewy, which would have been fine.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes I wear it under BareMinerals makeup and it works very well as a primer for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am 54 with very oily skin.  </li>
            <li>Goes on really goopy like I&#x27;d imagine</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t use too much of the product.  </li>
            <li>It does indeed smooth out the irregularities in my skin and give an overall improved appearance.  </li>
            <li>It really does make you look a bit airbrushed.</li>
            <li>Although, it&#x27;s very texturized....</li>
            <li>But this primer really does attach to hairy areas.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-I haven&#x27;t really noticed much of a difference in times when I apply this and times when I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I have oily eyelids, so maybe nothing will really help with that.&lt;br /&gt;-Expensive...</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>but I use it really as a primer,  </li>
            <li>Really like how my foundation looked with this</li>
            <li>Really did not care for this primer, it goes on sticky like.</li>
            <li>I closed the top, shook it</li>
            <li>Thanks for nothing.</li>
            <li>I wear it daily under make-up or just to cover my face and keep it smooth.</li>
            <li>Be careful when squeezing the bottle--you could end up with more than you&#x27;d like that.</li>
            <li>This stuff really moisturizing on the skin and gives a really silky mattifying effect.</li>
            <li>My skin gets really oily</li>
            <li>I really like this product and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t cover all of the lines but gives an overall smooth finish.</li>
            <li>in all, I really like this stuff.</li>
            <li>I put it on top of my moisturizer and under my concealer and other makeup.</li>
            <li>I have oily skin and this stuff really works especially when I do a full face.</li>
            <li>This is my first time trying Philosophy -- I&#x27;ll admit I was skeptical, but I&#x27;m so happy I went through with it.</li>
            <li>It feels good going on, but as it dries it creates a slight ghostly white appearance to your beard area.  </li>
            <li>Not sure if the formula was changed, but the primer doesn&#x27;t smell as nice or work as well as I remember.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several other makeup primers that promise similar results, but The Present is the best I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>I cannot live without this product!</li>
            <li>so if you have dry skin I suggest wearing an oil free moisturizer underneath.</li>
            <li>(I bought this a year or two ago and I have about half or more left).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(Revlon colorstay in particular for me).</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also bought a tube of the Supernatural face tint with SPF.  </li>
            <li>I love Philosophy products and especially, The Present.  </li>
            <li>had tried contouring before purchasing this and had fairly decent results</li>
            <li>and my makeup set in lines and cracks, making me appear much older.  </li>
            <li>I finally was able to get some white creamy stuff out and it felt like I was applying Elmer&#x27;s glue to my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a miracle worker by any means, but for a bit more of a put-together everyday look, I really like it.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t let it set up/absorb properly, your foundation isn&#x27;t going to look as smooth, which completely defeats the purpose of using a primer.</li>
            <li>just something light topped with a loose coat of powder to set it.  </li>
            <li>he highly recommended this...</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this.  </li>
            <li>Recommend it highly.,</li>
            <li>It is a little thicker than a face cream, but it does the trick making your face look smooth after you put foundation on!  </li>
            <li>A little bit goes a very long way &amp; using too much leaves your skin tacky &amp; makeup looking way less than perfect.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much thicker than most primers &amp; very little is needed.  </li>
            <li>And I really gave it the old college</li>
            <li>I really wanted a product that I could wear all year no matter how light or dark I got.</li>
            <li>I generally don&#x27;t like the feel of makeup on my face, but with the Present, I can smooth some on, and wear it all day and still feel like my skin can breath.  </li>
            <li>It makes my face look healthy without the heavy make up.</li>
            <li>which is my normal go-to.  </li>
            <li>Hopefully, Philosophy will change the hole size for better delivery/less waste.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple years and find that it consistently does just what I want it to do: smooth out any lines, blotches, uneven skin tones, etc., plus de-shines my face.</li>
            <li>I let it set the full two minutes as it said to do and then applied the supernatural over it along with some loose powder.  </li>
            <li>Even with the age spots I have, this is a huge improvement over the other foundation I have used for years.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
            <li>New to this product and product line.  </li>
            <li>Feeling like I wanted to try something new</li>
            <li>As it says, it is clear and really enhances your natural skin.  </li>
            <li>An easy everyday choice.  </li>
            <li>but the first time I used it I got a HUGE glob of the stuff by only applying a little pressure to the tube.  </li>
            <li>I let mine dry while I apply my concealer, which is a creamy consistency, so it actually goes on better with The Present underneath.  </li>
            <li>It was described as a clear foundation</li>
            <li>Your skin is incredibly soft after using this.</li>
            <li>&quot; -I nearly got halfway through before just tossing it in the trash because I can&#x27;t use it anymore</li>
            <li>The Present allows the makeup to really stick to the face and stay put.</li>
            <li>So far, it&#x27;s holding up to the hype...</li>
            <li>The feeling of The Present is very sticky/tacky whereas Smashbox&#x27;s Photo Finish goes on like air</li>
            <li>I have sensitive, oily and acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>I just opened it, and it is old or spoiled or something.</li>
            <li>And it makes your skin so soft.</li>
            <li>Hides all blemishes and/or wrinkles yet is not a heavy make-up.</li>
            <li>feel so soft.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I bought this as a makeup primer, which it works ok for, but my skin is looking and feeling dry and tight.  </li>
            <li>The first one is, is takes VERY little to do your face - just a tiny dab will, I promise, give you amount you need to adequately cover all areas of your face.  </li>
            <li>My daily routine is first, my Etude House Eye Cream (give 1 minute to absorb), PTR Oiless Oil (wait to absorb about 2 minutes), then apply The Present.</li>
            <li>My makeup stayed on so much longer and it was created such a nice smooth base for eyeshadow as well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for ages, with a little gap in the middle when I was more inclined to use foundation on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>I use this, a little concealer and peach or very light pink lip and cheek coloring of some sort.</li>
            <li>If you apply a large amount of this primer to your face, it will take forever to dry and it will have the consistency of Elmer&#x27;s Glue.</li>
            <li>(btw, this isn&#x27;t how all my other tubes have worked, but ok maybe it&#x27;s a little old?).</li>
            <li>This product came in a ziplock bag with a giant sticker with a new barcode over the one on the tube that also covered up part of the directions.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used this product for very long, but I have seen that it works really well under my makeup.</li>
            <li>I am a seventy nine year old (Lady), and love a product that does not make your aging lines look worse.</li>
            <li>I usually do not purchase facial creams, etc.</li>
            <li>Although I do love this product I am willing to try something in cheaper price range because $29 is kinda of expensive for a product I use occasionally.</li>
            <li>So you can imagine my surprise when I went out and glaced at myself in the mirror and noticed a foundation mustache that no matter how hard I tried to rub off just kept gathering and getting worse, like attaching more and more foundation to each mustache hair, and then I was left with a red foundation mustache.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>the trick to using this primer is this:  you only need a modest amount to get the desired affect.</li>
            <li>If your result is barely noticeable - trying going without it for a day.</li>
            <li>Thus far, I&#x27;ve found the key to be using the smallest amount (a thin, finger tip size smear) amount and waiting 2 minutes or more before applying foundation, finishing veil, and bronzer.</li>
            <li>Alas, too many people don&#x27;t bother to read OR follow directions .....</li>
            <li>It feels kind of glue-like, which sounds weird</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is true that you have to let it dry at least 2 minutes, sometimes I even wait 5minutes, so it really works.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, and it is definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>Makes your skin look less shiny and really hides imperfections.</li>
            <li>I have dry, sensitive skin that is acne-prone.  </li>
            <li>You will need to learn how much you need for your face because if you put too much, it&#x27;ll almost feel like you have a very thick layer of glue on your face.</li>

            <li> really good</li>
            <li> I tried this product after reading some reviews that it is a good moisturizer/coverup for men.  </li>
            <li> but I have got quite good skin.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m good to go.</li>
            <li> I just love that scent! :P</li>
            <li> Amazon had a great price and free shipping was a plus!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The product does feel greasy when you first apply it, but once it dries after about two minutes it leaves a wonderful matte finish to your skin.</li>
            <li> I love and have used it for years!</li>
            <li> and I fell in love with it!  </li>
            <li> Love!</li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using This primer for about 3 years now &amp; I LOVE it!</li>
            <li> So don&#x27;t use so much!!!!!  </li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t make my skin feel amazing plus</li>
            <li> I just smiled &amp; said thank-you.</li>
            <li> This product fits the bill nicely.</li>
            <li> It gives you a nice glow to your skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 38 and have nice but oily skin.  </li>
            <li> Kind of reminds me of glue, lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use this every day, its the perfect primer, it goes on wet and dries smooth, the best primer to use before foundation, cannot put make up on without it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used about every primer out there, &amp; this is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li> The directions say to give it two minutes, but honestly, you should give it more like 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this product!</li>
            <li> It does a great job of disguising pores, softening any fine lines, lessening shine, and giving a more even, smooth look.</li>
            <li> I loved it for myself!&lt;br /&gt;However, the smell kind of put me off at first.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a very nice primer, the first I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> My skin is highly sensitive though, very fair</li>
            <li> Philosophy the present is an excellent product.</li>
            <li> The tacky consistency makes this product a PERFECT makeup primer, especially for oily skin.</li>
            <li> I wear a light liquid foundation over it when I go to work; use it on its own on the weekends.  </li>
            <li> Oh, and it smells FABULOUS!  </li>
            <li> so I guess that makes it okay to post a review.  </li>
            <li> I do have to blot my face in the afternoon, but that&#x27;s just my oily skin, and I would rather blot than pile more powder on.  </li>
            <li> I promise your makeup will go on better and stay fresher longer if you use this product according to directions.  </li>
            <li> Love love this stuff, Would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Amazon is awesome for offering the subscribe and save as it knocks a couple dollars off of the standard price.  </li>
            <li> Also the EWGT rates this product as a 3 (one a scale of 0 to 10) which is a plus as it doesn&#x27;t contain as many chemicals as many of the products out there.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> But I mostly bought it to kept my under-eye concealer in place..</li>
            <li> I love this pre-makeup cream.  </li>
            <li> This moisturizer is the best yet, it is smooth, not oily and you don&#x27;t even need a powder to complete it.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t do powder b/c most powders make my face feel itchy but just use something that matches ur skin then ur g2g.</li>
            <li> it just makes ur skin look better</li>
            <li> Love Phiosophy, just not this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just OK.  </li>
            <li> LOVE</li>
            <li> Satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> and I LOVE the product \\&quot;The</li>
            <li> I have had and used better primer for my face.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff even though it does make me look ashy.</li>
            <li> Most wait before applying makeup.</li>
            <li> I love this.  </li>
            <li> I needed a primer that was healthy for my skin, would not clog pores but would hide them, and that would give me an airbrushed look.  </li>
            <li> My makeup just looks better using this too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I instantly purchased and very happy with it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m always in the market for a better one to show up.</li>
            <li> This is not something you want on your skin if you&#x27;re going to be out in the sun as it causes photosensitivity... or in layman&#x27;s terms, possibly more sun spots.</li>
            <li> Personally, I love it.  </li>
            <li> I may or may not repurchase because I have better primers much better suited to my combination skin.</li>
            <li> get more than what you pay for, for sure.</li>
            <li> May be better for the summer months.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I was also very excited to try this primer.</li>
            <li> It is a pretty good primer, if you&#x27;re looking for one.  </li>
            <li> I will most definitely use this for special occasions under my foundation when I want to look flawless!  </li>
            <li> I LOVE Philosophy &amp; thought I&#x27;d LOVE the Present too (&amp; the price was GREAT), but it didn&#x27;t hold up to my expectations.  </li>
            <li> easy to remove at night with your selected beauty regemin cleanser.  </li>
            <li> Strongly recommend this to people with problem skin like mine.</li>
            <li> Minerals being the other option, are better, but lack the coverage that I&#x27;d ideally like.</li>
            <li> I find that using this primer helps my T-zone stay much more matte during a full day of work and afterwards.  </li>
            <li> It minimizes the appearance of fine line and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> because the lavender oil can cause break-outs, but it seems totally fine on my face.</li>
            <li> The first time I wore it (under a powder foundation), I had family members compliment me on how different and perfect my skin looked.</li>
            <li> No build up in wrinkles and it really makes my skin look better!</li>
            <li> I applied it, the consistancy was good liked that, let it dry over the 2 minutes and then applied my foundation.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best primer I have found so far.</li>
            <li> This product does what it says and very cost effective</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re much thinner, set up faster and provide a nice canvas for makeup.</li>
            <li> After I put this on I put a light layer of translucent powder from bamboo wear.</li>
            <li> This glides on your face smoothly and evenly and makes your skin silky smooth.  </li>
            <li> I urge anyone who has a makeup free complexion to give this a try.</li>
            <li> It feels so smooth on my face.  </li>
            <li> Makes me appear poreless and wrinkle free</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it is the product itself or it just doesn&#x27;t fit well with my skin.</li>
            <li> Just light pats with a tissue or cotton pad to pick up an excess.</li>
            <li> Smells and feels great, applies nicely enough</li>
            <li> It makes my skin have a smooth finish.</li>
            <li> It does such a good job that most days</li>
            <li> It is a clear make-up and good for the skin.</li>
            <li> After a whole day my makeup looks much better with The Present underneath than without; my makeup &amp;#34;sticks&amp;#34; longer, and before I had problems that my forehead and nose-area would become very oily but this products has reduced that which makes me very happy!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Other than this small issue this is a wonderful product!</li>
            <li> Nice and thick covers nicely and has nice scent.  </li>
            <li> It is worth the wait time!</li>
            <li> Specially in the cheeks and chin area.</li>
            <li> I feel that it is a good value - my last bottle lasted about 3 years.</li>
            <li> texture is cool.</li>
            <li> You MUST give it the full 2 minutes to set before applying makeup.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good enough to wear alone</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t break me out; it feels great on my skin; it seals in my moisturizer, sunscreen and dark spot fade cream (my medicine layer), and then I put this on, waiting the full 2 minutes for it to set, which is important.  </li>
            <li> This is the perfect primer... minimizes pores, controls shine, glues my foundation onto my face... which means no more makeup meltdown!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for quite a while now, and, while everyone is entitled to their own opinion, there are some things that are important to know if you want to reap the full benefits of The Present.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, it&#x27;s a great primer.</li>
            <li> I think it would work best on those who wear mineral powder foundation or no makeup at all, needing just a subtle improvement.  </li>
            <li> I feel more confident about my appearance when I wear it, because I don&#x27;t look like I have makeup on, but my face looks smoother and younger.</li>
            <li> It shipped and arrived at my door quickly.</li>
            <li> I will do an experiment to see if there is really a tremendous difference between this and something else.</li>
            <li> I mean, it&#x27;s not absolutely terrible, but it&#x27;s not that great either.</li>
            <li> I have been hunting for a good under makeup primer for a long time.</li>
            <li> It does an excellent job as a primer, as long as you let it set up for several minutes.</li>
            <li> It is very lightweight, but it does fill in those fine lines.</li>
            <li> I still use Skindinavia, &amp; I&#x27;m sure that helps makeup stay put as well, but The Present has made a HUGE difference.  </li>
            <li> I just love this clear makeup mostly b/c it fells and looks so natural on me.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly under makeup and gives makeup appear more like an  air brushed look.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth the price..</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve never had success with this.</li>
            <li> I love this natural looking makeup.  </li>
            <li> It keeps my makeup fresh looking longer.</li>
            <li> Stick with one thin layer and be a beautiful you!</li>
            <li> Philosophy products are over priced but this one is worth its price.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need much of it - just apply to clean skin.</li>
            <li> Since starting with The Present, I have changed to a layer of this.. and some powder on top for a nice matte finish.  </li>
            <li> and it is okay if you want a really bare face,</li>
            <li> Ok for a primer, kind of thick and sticky.</li>
            <li> This is also a great price for this product compared to buying it in more expensive makeup stores.</li>
            <li> I will still use Smashbox for important days, and just use this for other days until I run out, but I won&#x27;t be buying more.</li>
            <li> and I like the present much more)</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t speak to pore minimizing, but that wasn&#x27;t what I was interested in.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this product at a local sephora store about 2 years ago and have been in love ever since.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a real winner!</li>
            <li> The only place that I found it was ok was on my eyelids, nose, cheeks and on forehead but not too close to my hairline or eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE Philosophy&#x27;s The Present!  </li>
            <li> It recommends 2 full minutes, but that wasn&#x27;t long enough, in my opinion, so I wait 5 minutes (sometimes longer) &amp; my foundation looks perfect all day long.  </li>
            <li> This really does work!</li>
            <li> I have been an avid foundation wearer..</li>
            <li> Definitely a no no.. makes for a more rubbery look and feel.  </li>
            <li> First of all, maybe it&#x27;s just me</li>
            <li> Willing to bet people with issues didn&#x27;t follow the directions.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li> Light and not heavy.</li>
            <li> I love The Present....</li>
            <li> I end up wasting a bit because I inevitably end up squeezing out more than I need.</li>
            <li> A lot of product for a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;I will be buying this again!</li>
            <li> I really wanted to LOVE it and used it consistently for a couple of weeks trying different methods of application, time, etc...  </li>
            <li> I had much more success with Covergirl Simply Ageless Serum primer w/Olay and Sally Hansen Natural Beauty Luminizing Face Primer.</li>
            <li> the first time I applied it, I used too much...</li>
            <li> Usually philosophy products from amazon are just as good as those from sephora or even philosophy itself but not this time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first primer that I&#x27;ve tried, and it doesn&#x27;t really make that much of a difference in my skin or makeup application/</li>
            <li> And (2), it can make my dry skin flakey; however, I compensate by using a good moisturizer before applying The Present.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 46, still prone to a breakout now and then, large pores, and very oily skin.  </li>
            <li> In short, it&#x27;s a good primer, and it does help my bare minerals stay on a little longer than with other primers, but it isn&#x27;t as great as he was doting over it in his video.</li>
            <li> Outside of that, once I put it on it made my skin very shiny, NOT dewy, which would have been fine.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes I wear it under BareMinerals makeup and it works very well as a primer for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am 54 with very oily skin.  </li>
            <li> Goes on really goopy like I&#x27;d imagine</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t use too much of the product.  </li>
            <li> It does indeed smooth out the irregularities in my skin and give an overall improved appearance.  </li>
            <li> It really does make you look a bit airbrushed.</li>
            <li> Although, it&#x27;s very texturized....</li>
            <li> But this primer really does attach to hairy areas.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-I haven&#x27;t really noticed much of a difference in times when I apply this and times when I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I have oily eyelids, so maybe nothing will really help with that.&lt;br /&gt;-Expensive...</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> but I use it really as a primer,  </li>
            <li> Really like how my foundation looked with this</li>
            <li> Really did not care for this primer, it goes on sticky like.</li>
            <li> I closed the top, shook it</li>
            <li> Thanks for nothing.</li>
            <li> I wear it daily under make-up or just to cover my face and keep it smooth.</li>
            <li> Be careful when squeezing the bottle--you could end up with more than you&#x27;d like that.</li>
            <li> This stuff really moisturizing on the skin and gives a really silky mattifying effect.</li>
            <li> My skin gets really oily</li>
            <li> I really like this product and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cover all of the lines but gives an overall smooth finish.</li>
            <li> in all, I really like this stuff.</li>
            <li> I put it on top of my moisturizer and under my concealer and other makeup.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and this stuff really works especially when I do a full face.</li>
            <li> This is my first time trying Philosophy -- I&#x27;ll admit I was skeptical, but I&#x27;m so happy I went through with it.</li>
            <li> It feels good going on, but as it dries it creates a slight ghostly white appearance to your beard area.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if the formula was changed, but the primer doesn&#x27;t smell as nice or work as well as I remember.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several other makeup primers that promise similar results, but The Present is the best I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> I cannot live without this product!</li>
            <li> so if you have dry skin I suggest wearing an oil free moisturizer underneath.</li>
            <li> (I bought this a year or two ago and I have about half or more left).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (Revlon colorstay in particular for me).</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also bought a tube of the Supernatural face tint with SPF.  </li>
            <li> I love Philosophy products and especially, The Present.  </li>
            <li> had tried contouring before purchasing this and had fairly decent results</li>
            <li> and my makeup set in lines and cracks, making me appear much older.  </li>
            <li> I finally was able to get some white creamy stuff out and it felt like I was applying Elmer&#x27;s glue to my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a miracle worker by any means, but for a bit more of a put-together everyday look, I really like it.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t let it set up/absorb properly, your foundation isn&#x27;t going to look as smooth, which completely defeats the purpose of using a primer.</li>
            <li> just something light topped with a loose coat of powder to set it.  </li>
            <li> he highly recommended this...</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this.  </li>
            <li> Recommend it highly.,</li>
            <li> It is a little thicker than a face cream, but it does the trick making your face look smooth after you put foundation on!  </li>
            <li> A little bit goes a very long way &amp; using too much leaves your skin tacky &amp; makeup looking way less than perfect.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much thicker than most primers &amp; very little is needed.  </li>
            <li> And I really gave it the old college</li>
            <li> I really wanted a product that I could wear all year no matter how light or dark I got.</li>
            <li> I generally don&#x27;t like the feel of makeup on my face, but with the Present, I can smooth some on, and wear it all day and still feel like my skin can breath.  </li>
            <li> It makes my face look healthy without the heavy make up.</li>
            <li> which is my normal go-to.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully, Philosophy will change the hole size for better delivery/less waste.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple years and find that it consistently does just what I want it to do: smooth out any lines, blotches, uneven skin tones, etc., plus de-shines my face.</li>
            <li> I let it set the full two minutes as it said to do and then applied the supernatural over it along with some loose powder.  </li>
            <li> Even with the age spots I have, this is a huge improvement over the other foundation I have used for years.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
            <li> New to this product and product line.  </li>
            <li> Feeling like I wanted to try something new</li>
            <li> As it says, it is clear and really enhances your natural skin.  </li>
            <li> An easy everyday choice.  </li>
            <li> but the first time I used it I got a HUGE glob of the stuff by only applying a little pressure to the tube.  </li>
            <li> I let mine dry while I apply my concealer, which is a creamy consistency, so it actually goes on better with The Present underneath.  </li>
            <li> It was described as a clear foundation</li>
            <li> Your skin is incredibly soft after using this.</li>
            <li> &quot; -I nearly got halfway through before just tossing it in the trash because I can&#x27;t use it anymore</li>
            <li> The Present allows the makeup to really stick to the face and stay put.</li>
            <li> So far, it&#x27;s holding up to the hype...</li>
            <li> The feeling of The Present is very sticky/tacky whereas Smashbox&#x27;s Photo Finish goes on like air</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, oily and acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> I just opened it, and it is old or spoiled or something.</li>
            <li> And it makes your skin so soft.</li>
            <li> Hides all blemishes and/or wrinkles yet is not a heavy make-up.</li>
            <li> feel so soft.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I bought this as a makeup primer, which it works ok for, but my skin is looking and feeling dry and tight.  </li>
            <li> The first one is, is takes VERY little to do your face - just a tiny dab will, I promise, give you amount you need to adequately cover all areas of your face.  </li>
            <li> My daily routine is first, my Etude House Eye Cream (give 1 minute to absorb), PTR Oiless Oil (wait to absorb about 2 minutes), then apply The Present.</li>
            <li> My makeup stayed on so much longer and it was created such a nice smooth base for eyeshadow as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for ages, with a little gap in the middle when I was more inclined to use foundation on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> I use this, a little concealer and peach or very light pink lip and cheek coloring of some sort.</li>
            <li> If you apply a large amount of this primer to your face, it will take forever to dry and it will have the consistency of Elmer&#x27;s Glue.</li>
            <li> (btw, this isn&#x27;t how all my other tubes have worked, but ok maybe it&#x27;s a little old?).</li>
            <li> This product came in a ziplock bag with a giant sticker with a new barcode over the one on the tube that also covered up part of the directions.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this product for very long, but I have seen that it works really well under my makeup.</li>
            <li> I am a seventy nine year old (Lady), and love a product that does not make your aging lines look worse.</li>
            <li> I usually do not purchase facial creams, etc.</li>
            <li> Although I do love this product I am willing to try something in cheaper price range because $29 is kinda of expensive for a product I use occasionally.</li>
            <li> So you can imagine my surprise when I went out and glaced at myself in the mirror and noticed a foundation mustache that no matter how hard I tried to rub off just kept gathering and getting worse, like attaching more and more foundation to each mustache hair, and then I was left with a red foundation mustache.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> the trick to using this primer is this:  you only need a modest amount to get the desired affect.</li>
            <li> If your result is barely noticeable - trying going without it for a day.</li>
            <li> Thus far, I&#x27;ve found the key to be using the smallest amount (a thin, finger tip size smear) amount and waiting 2 minutes or more before applying foundation, finishing veil, and bronzer.</li>
            <li> Alas, too many people don&#x27;t bother to read OR follow directions .....</li>
            <li> It feels kind of glue-like, which sounds weird</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is true that you have to let it dry at least 2 minutes, sometimes I even wait 5minutes, so it really works.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, and it is definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> Makes your skin look less shiny and really hides imperfections.</li>
            <li> I have dry, sensitive skin that is acne-prone.  </li>
            <li> You will need to learn how much you need for your face because if you put too much, it&#x27;ll almost feel like you have a very thick layer of glue on your face.</li>
            <li> The second one is, and this ties in with #1, after you apply your tiny dab, you need to let it dry COMPLETELY (which doesn&#x27;t take long at all if you use the correct amount) before attempting to put your makeup on.  </li>
            <li> It also has a rather large opening and little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> You only need a very small amount, too, so the price is right because this will last you forever!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too thick and ruins the smooth glide of my mineral powder.</li>
            <li> have been using the Present for a long time.</li>
            <li> I am an adult acne sufferer who uses Retin-A, but I still get areas of break-outs, oily T-zone, and due to the Retin-A flaky, dry skin patches.</li>
            <li> The 2 ounces that you get will last a very, VERY long time.  </li>
            <li> It does have a slight scent to it, so if you are sensitive to those things you may not like it as well...</li>
            <li> but it just looks like you have dry skin or some type of white powder</li>
            <li> I have extremely oily skin and rather large pores on my nose and cheeks and have struggled to find a primer that will minimize my pores and keep my face from turning into an oil slick after an hour of wearing.</li>
            <li> I feel like it also moisturizes the skin and does fill in the skin a little bit (but not so much that small holes, pores or wrinkles will look that much different).</li>
            <li> You only need a little bit all over your face for long lasting makeup.</li>
            <li> like (the only other one that I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> &amp; I&#x27;ll continue to use this as long as they keep making it!</li>
            <li> Because you only need a little bit of it, this tube will last you a very very long time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hydrating for dry skin but doesn&#x27;t overhydrate oily skin.</li>
            <li> This made my face dry</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is expensive but I won&#x27;t return it yet and give it a few more days...unless a close friend asks me what&#x27;s on my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , you have to wait literally 5-10 minutes for it to dry on your face before applying makeup.  </li>
            <li> Even on super hot, humid days, this makeup base holds up to the test.</li>
            <li> Make sure to let it soak in for a couple of minutes before applying your base or it can create some sort of odd pastey-like substance when mixed with your foundation too early.</li>
            <li> and I normally do not wear a foundation at all...</li>
            <li> Primer:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to admit that I&#x27;m kind of disappointed by this primer.</li>
            <li> and then I put loose powder on.  </li>
            <li> I screw the cap back on and turn it over to squeeze a bit into my hand and a bunch of watery-like liquid poured into my hand down into my sink.  </li>
            <li> It only takes a small amount to cover your entire face.  </li>
            <li> little goes a long way - hard to do because the hole is quite large; squeeze gently so only a little comes out.</li>
            <li> Slippery silicon primers mixed with oily skin is just a mess and makeup tends to slide off the face.</li>
            <li> Because I only use a little bit everyday, it&#x27;s going to last me for a long time</li>
            <li> It aslo seems a bit drying and the next day my skin is a little flakey</li>
            <li> Only a little cheek color, ege brows and lip</li>
            <li> , however, I have Very Oily skin, and unfortunately, The Present did not hold up to my expectations...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Never really sinks in or sets up</li>
            <li> then they wonder why the product doesn&#x27;t work as expected.  </li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel smoother, but not much else.&lt;br /&gt;-I&#x27;ve tried it for an eyelid primer as well as face primer, and it doesn&#x27;t work too well.</li>
            <li> I hear you should careful with this though...</li>
            <li> Morning came and I unscrewed the cap to take off the seal, everything going as expected.</li>
            <li> so I have to be careful with cream based products.</li>
            <li> Also, a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> But, as the other reviewers have said, a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I have some discoloration and other marks</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even bother putting any other makeup over it.</li>
            <li> The Present smooths over pores and small lines</li>
            <li> I probably ended up wasting at least a weeks worth of the product just because of the poor design of the tube.  </li>
            <li> is cream based, and a little goes a long way (about dime size or less).</li>
            <li> /&gt;You are probably thinking, &amp;#34; This girl with the major eye wrinkles, needs to wax!&amp;#34; And after my horrific day out, i&#x27;m sure everyone else was thinking that too.  </li>
            <li> This tube will last me at least a year.</li>
            <li> I like to just use what ever I used on my lip on my cheeks and as a eye shadow too, for eyes if I do use anything dark I like to use a dark brown liner or mascara.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Clear liquid or water is running out of the tube, the make up is thin.</li>
            <li> it will eradicate lines, only because it&#x27;s so thick and therefore covers everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So if you put on your make-up and try to smooth it later it will create patches that cannot be smoothed out, this is especially bad around &amp;#34;hairy areas&amp;#34; so upper lip, eyebrows, anywhere with even slight peach</li>
            <li> Makeup breaks down about 4 hours after wear.</li>
            <li> For some odd reason, I don&#x27;t like it.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t keep the shine away, and it has an odd, greasy feel to it.</li>
            <li> I would think if you had black skin that it would look like you smeared something on your face...</li>
            <li> black guys</li>
            <li> Wait time of less than 5 minutes will result in a ruined foundation.  </li>
            <li> I know some say it felt like glue going on, that&#x27;s not true in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> Not true.  </li>
            <li> A little powder.</li>
            <li> The make up was very thin and did not last long.</li>
            <li> A few years ago I received this in a gift bag of philosophy products and tried it just to see what it was.  </li>
            <li> after applying, do allow it to set for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> this is to heavy for me, but I am not a makeup wearer, I</li>
            <li> I use it everyday after my cleansing steps.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like heavy foundation,</li>
            <li> It does seem to work, but it is somewhat heavy in consistency and is not matte</li>
            <li> Does make a slick surface when applied, dried for 2 min as instructed; but, does nothing to minimize pores which it claimed to do.....</li>
            <li> This thing is now 3/4 EMPTY!!!!</li>
            <li> By the end of the day my face was very oily and looked bad.  </li>
            <li> I expect to purchase this once a year, because of the small amount that is required each use.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this product in the past from QVC.  </li>
            <li> I also found small specks of flakes on my face after an hour.  </li>
            <li> I use this make up all the time, and usually buy it over the counter at Macy&#x27;s or Nordstroms.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why Philosophy puts it in this product, but keep this in mind.</li>
            <li> I moisturize as usual</li>
            <li> I recommend waiting at least 5 minutes before applying your foundation.  </li>
            <li> Really sucks the shine off the centre of my face and did not cause me to break out.</li>
            <li> but I found it to be thick and cakey.  </li>
            <li> so when foundation is applied (even after the requisite 2 minutes), it streaks on in big, greasy lines and is impossible to blend in.</li>
            <li> Not good for my oily skin.</li>
            <li> not a good product leaves your face oily</li>
            <li> This product is very thick.</li>
            <li> I used it as a base prior to putting make up on</li>
            <li> and I have broken out after not having not even one pimple for months.</li>
            <li> This cream acts almost like a thin coat of paint primer.  </li>
            <li> The two reasons I didn&#x27;t rate it 5 stars: (1) it&#x27;s a bit expensive; but, in its defense, you only have to use a pea sized amount.</li>
            <li> -it&#x27;s useless to me.</li>
            <li> Just wish Smashbox wasn&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
            <li> Sadly I tried this product.</li>
            <li> , it has a weird sort of smell to it.</li>
            <li> Horrible product -- don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> For that, the price isn&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> but I had read that a base like this one would help.  </li>
            <li> It smells really bad!  </li>
            <li> I  am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> It just looks AWFUL.</li>
            <li> but this is just horrible for my skin.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product does what it says and very cost effective</li>
            <li> Philosophy the present is an excellent product. It goes on smoothly under makeup and gives makeup appear more like an  air brushed look.</li>
            <li> This seems like a good product.  If you&#x27;re used to wearing liquid foundation like I am then it&#x27;s not going to be a miracle product but it does make the foundation that you do wear look smoother.  I will most definitely use this for special occasions under my foundation when I want to look flawless!  I have some discoloration and other marks, this product doesn&#x27;t conceal any of that but I don&#x27;t think it is meant for that.  I think it would work best on those who wear mineral powder foundation or no makeup at all, needing just a subtle improvement.  It aslo seems a bit drying and the next day my skin is a little flakey so if you have dry skin I suggest wearing an oil free moisturizer underneath.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several years. It smells wonderful (like lavender oil) and is very effective at evening out my skin tone and reducing shine. It does such a good job that most days I don&#x27;t even bother putting any other makeup over it. Sometimes I wear it under BareMinerals makeup and it works very well as a primer for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product does feel greasy when you first apply it, but once it dries after about two minutes it leaves a wonderful matte finish to your skin. I feel that it is a good value - my last bottle lasted about 3 years.</li>
            <li> Arrived berly milky as if water had been added to the container. Returned it immediately</li>
            <li> Does make a slick surface when applied, dried for 2 min as instructed; but, does nothing to minimize pores which it claimed to do.....</li>
            <li> Took a chance on this product, and works miracles, I love it!!!  I will purchase it in the future!!!!</li>
            <li> Ok for a primer, kind of thick and sticky. Does nothing for oil control as others said it would</li>
            <li> I cannot live without this product! I put it on top of my moisturizer and under my concealer and other makeup. This lotion smooths the complexion of your skin and makes makeup look flawless. Your skin is incredibly soft after using this. I have used this for years and will alway use it! This is also a great price for this product compared to buying it in more expensive makeup stores.</li>
            <li> I had a lot of expectations with this product, although I&#x27;ve read mixed reviews.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is oily and acne-prone, I don&#x27;t wear foundation but I do use concealer and mineral powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a very nice primer, the first I&#x27;ve ever used. It does help with complexion, and oil control and it&#x27;s great at that! If you have redness it will dissipate.  I don&#x27;t feel it helps to reduce pores or wrinkles. I doesn&#x27;t help to reduce acne but it WONT break you out... so that&#x27;s good. I feel like it also moisturizes the skin and does fill in the skin a little bit (but not so much that small holes, pores or wrinkles will look that much different). It has a matte finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is true that you have to let it dry at least 2 minutes, sometimes I even wait 5minutes, so it really works. You don&#x27;t have to use a lot, because if you do it will kinda peal off, so it does last for months.. it&#x27;s worth the price.. but i would try others to see what it&#x27;s  like (the only other one that I&#x27;ve used it&#x27;s the monistat chafing cream and I like the present much more)</li>
            <li> Works great for a primer...</li>
            <li> Purchased this product, because I heard everything great about  PHILOSPHY...I usually do not purchase facial creams, etc. over the counter...( I have presription products from my dermatologist) I am 54 with very oily skin.  I have no wrinkles but I still  have occacional breakouts. \\&quot;The Present\\&quot; keeps the oils under control, I am very impressed ..furthermore it did not cause any irritation or breakouts!!!  Love it!!</li>
            <li> Goes on really goopy like I&#x27;d imagine Elmer&#x27;s Glue would feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never really sinks in or sets up so when foundation is applied (even after the requisite 2 minutes), it streaks on in big, greasy lines and is impossible to blend in. The result is a big mask of goop that feels horrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes it will eradicate lines, only because it&#x27;s so thick and therefore covers everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never had success with this. And I really gave it the old college \\&quot;go\\&quot; -I nearly got halfway through before just tossing it in the trash because I can&#x27;t use it anymore -it&#x27;s useless to me. It just looks AWFUL. I had much more success with Covergirl Simply Ageless Serum primer w/Olay and Sally Hansen Natural Beauty Luminizing Face Primer. They&#x27;re much thinner, set up faster and provide a nice canvas for makeup.</li>
            <li> Amazing! I have been hunting for a good under makeup primer for a long time. I am an adult acne sufferer who uses Retin-A, but I still get areas of break-outs, oily T-zone, and due to the Retin-A flaky, dry skin patches. I use mineral makeup because creams and liquids feel like they melt off my face half-way through the day. Minerals being the other option, are better, but lack the coverage that I&#x27;d ideally like. But this foundation/primer keeps the mineral powder from being disappearing and gives my skin an airbrush look (just as advertised!). Thus far, I&#x27;ve found the key to be using the smallest amount (a thin, finger tip size smear) amount and waiting 2 minutes or more before applying foundation, finishing veil, and bronzer. Can&#x27;t speak to pore minimizing, but that wasn&#x27;t what I was interested in. I got what I wanted! Strongly recommend this to people with problem skin like mine.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the look of makeup on my face, but I need something to even out my skin tone. I have found the solution to this problem with the Present. I feel more confident about my appearance when I wear it, because I don&#x27;t look like I have makeup on, but my face looks smoother and younger. You don&#x27;t need much of it - just apply to clean skin. Feels great.</li>
            <li> I love and have used it for years!</li>
            <li> The tacky consistency makes this product a PERFECT makeup primer, especially for oily skin. Slippery silicon primers mixed with oily skin is just a mess and makeup tends to slide off the face. The Present allows the makeup to really stick to the face and stay put. I will never use anything else for primer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT:&lt;br /&gt;-Downgraded one star after using a different foundation.&lt;br /&gt;-Certain foundations, when used with this primer, do not blend well at all (Revlon colorstay in particular for me).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 46, still prone to a breakout now and then, large pores, and very oily skin.  This product is great to reduce the appearance of pores and even out skin tone.  Better yet is that it does a great job of keeping shine away!  I wear a light liquid foundation over it when I go to work; use it on its own on the weekends.  But, as the other reviewers have said, a little goes a long way and you DO need to let it set up for 2 minutes.  (I put my body lotion on while waiting for it to set; that way I don&#x27;t \\&quot;forget\\&quot; to wait to put my makeup on.)  Oh, and it smells FABULOUS!  I believe it has lavender in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also bought a tube of the Supernatural face tint with SPF.  For some odd reason, I don&#x27;t like it.  It doesn&#x27;t keep the shine away, and it has an odd, greasy feel to it.</li>
            <li> My mom gave me a sample of this a while ago and I fell in love with it!  I know some say it felt like glue going on, that&#x27;s not true in my opinion.  It is a little thicker than a face cream, but it does the trick making your face look smooth after you put foundation on!  I get compliments on how smooth my face looks, almost flawless...it wouldn&#x27;t be like that without this product trust me...I have tried it without and it is not the same!  Great buy if you ask me!!</li>
            <li> I was on the search for the BEST primer that didn&#x27;t add shine to my already combination skin.  I LOVE Philosophy &amp; thought I&#x27;d LOVE the Present too (&amp; the price was GREAT), but it didn&#x27;t hold up to my expectations.  It&#x27;s much thicker than most primers &amp; very little is needed.  It states to wait 2 min&#x27;s before applying make-up &amp; I&#x27;ve tried between 2 min&#x27;s - 30 min&#x27;s to see if that made a difference.  By mid-morning I&#x27;d find my make-up was starting to look cakey on my oily areas.  I really wanted to LOVE it and used it consistently for a couple of weeks trying different methods of application, time, etc...  Finally, gave up &amp; spending the $ for Smashbox.  So far, it&#x27;s holding up to the hype...even received compliments about something being different about me after using it a couple of days.  I just smiled &amp; said thank-you.</li>
            <li> I did not purchase this product on Amazon, but my next tube will be from here so I guess that makes it okay to post a review.  I have been using this product for quite a while now, and, while everyone is entitled to their own opinion, there are some things that are important to know if you want to reap the full benefits of The Present.  The first one is, is takes VERY little to do your face - just a tiny dab will, I promise, give you amount you need to adequately cover all areas of your face.  The second one is, and this ties in with #1, after you apply your tiny dab, you need to let it dry COMPLETELY (which doesn&#x27;t take long at all if you use the correct amount) before attempting to put your makeup on.  I let mine dry while I apply my concealer, which is a creamy consistency, so it actually goes on better with The Present underneath.  I find that using this primer helps my T-zone stay much more matte during a full day of work and afterwards.  I do have to blot my face in the afternoon, but that&#x27;s just my oily skin, and I would rather blot than pile more powder on.  If you apply a large amount of this primer to your face, it will take forever to dry and it will have the consistency of Elmer&#x27;s Glue. So don&#x27;t use so much!!!!!  I promise your makeup will go on better and stay fresher longer if you use this product according to directions.  Alas, too many people don&#x27;t bother to read OR follow directions ..... then they wonder why the product doesn&#x27;t work as expected.  It&#x27;s great stuff, probably the best primer I&#x27;ve ever used, and I&#x27;ve tried many.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for years...........love,love</li>
            <li> I really wanted a product that I could wear all year no matter how light or dark I got. I also have splotchy skin occasionally that I wanted to have covered up. This product fits the bill nicely. After I put this on I put a light layer of translucent powder from bamboo wear. It looks very nice with the powder but if I wanted I could just wear it by itself.</li>
            <li> Love love this stuff, Would recommend this to anyone. You can wear alone, or under your makeup. It gives you a nice glow to your skin.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best primer I have found so far. I have extremely oily skin and rather large pores on my nose and cheeks and have struggled to find a primer that will minimize my pores and keep my face from turning into an oil slick after an hour of wearing. It can be a bit tacky but it keeps makeup in place all day. I&#x27;ve found that it works best if you pat into skin in areas instead of rubbing. Amazing product!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this product! I watched YouTube video with Mr Goss/my go-to make-up guru and he highly recommended this... so I took a chance and totally agree with how well this works! It does have a slight scent to it, so if you are sensitive to those things you may not like it as well... but it does what it says it does... I like the brand, but this is their best product ever!!! Best buy for 2013 for me!!</li>
            <li> A few years ago I received this in a gift bag of philosophy products and tried it just to see what it was.  I have loved and used it ever since that time.  I do not use any makeup except for eye makeup.  This glides on your face smoothly and evenly and makes your skin silky smooth.  As it says, it is clear and really enhances your natural skin.  This tube will last me at least a year. It only takes a small amount to cover your entire face.  I urge anyone who has a makeup free complexion to give this a try.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this product at a local sephora store about 2 years ago and have been in love ever since.  Great base make up; you put it on after your lotion; let it sit for 2 minutes and then I put loose powder on.  That is it.  Amazon is awesome for offering the subscribe and save as it knocks a couple dollars off of the standard price.  One bottle lasts me about 6 months so you don&#x27;t use too much of the product.  Also the EWGT rates this product as a 3 (one a scale of 0 to 10) which is a plus as it doesn&#x27;t contain as many chemicals as many of the products out there.  Wonderful and will continue to use.</li>
            <li> I love this natural looking makeup.  It can be worn alone or with makeup.  An easy everyday choice.  I can&#x27;t live without it.  It gives a matte look.  #1 pick</li>
            <li> This product is everything I hoped it would be.  I generally don&#x27;t like the feel of makeup on my face, but with the Present, I can smooth some on, and wear it all day and still feel like my skin can breath.  It does indeed smooth out the irregularities in my skin and give an overall improved appearance.  It amazes me everytime I use it.  A little goes a long way, and it is definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It really does make you look a bit airbrushed. My only problem is that it seems as though every time I use it I break out (which is not the norm for me) just a bit on one part of face or another. I cannot  definitively say that it is the product at fault, but I do have to wonder. My skin is highly sensitive though, very fair and I normally do not wear a foundation at all...so it could just me me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than this small issue this is a wonderful product!</li>
            <li> I used to buy this stuff a lot. It&#x27;s hydrating for dry skin but doesn&#x27;t overhydrate oily skin. My younger brother uses it as well and he has acne issues. Although, it&#x27;s very texturized.... so personally, I don&#x27;t wear it under make up. It&#x27;s too thick and ruins the smooth glide of my mineral powder. Also, when I was buying it the price wasn&#x27;t $28.....</li>
            <li> Horrible product -- don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I use this every day, its the perfect primer, it goes on wet and dries smooth, the best primer to use before foundation, cannot put make up on without it</li>
            <li> I love Philosophy products and especially, The Present.  It just works so well when I use it after Hope in a Jar and before my foundation and powder. Have used it for years! It&#x27;s a real winner! Amazon had a great price and free shipping was a plus!</li>
            <li> This is literally like face glue! So if you put on your make-up and try to smooth it later it will create patches that cannot be smoothed out, this is especially bad around &amp;#34;hairy areas&amp;#34; so upper lip, eyebrows, anywhere with even slight peach fuzz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not a &amp;#34;hairy girl&amp;#34; in fact I am one of those people that could go without shaving for a LOOONG time and no one would notice. But this primer really does attach to hairy areas. So you can imagine my surprise when I went out and glaced at myself in the mirror and noticed a foundation mustache that no matter how hard I tried to rub off just kept gathering and getting worse, like attaching more and more foundation to each mustache hair, and then I was left with a red foundation mustache.&lt;br /&gt;Just imagine rubbing a glue stick on your face, then covering that with foundation.. NOT CUTE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what about the under eye?? NO!! it does the same thing there! The only place that I found it was ok was on my eyelids, nose, cheeks and on forehead but not too close to my hairline or eyebrows. But I mostly bought it to kept my under-eye concealer in place.. and it did, in my EYE CREASES!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You are probably thinking, &amp;#34; This girl with the major eye wrinkles, needs to wax!&amp;#34; And after my horrific day out, i&#x27;m sure everyone else was thinking that too.  So unless you want to be Wrinkly-eye, mustache girl too... buy a different primer!</li>
            <li> This review is for Philosophy&#x27;s The Present Invisible Skin Perfector &amp; Oil-Free Makeup Primer:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to admit that I&#x27;m kind of disappointed by this primer. It&#x27;s the first primer that I&#x27;ve tried, and it doesn&#x27;t really make that much of a difference in my skin or makeup application/longevity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Smells really good - it has this herbal, calming scent that&#x27;s reminiscent of Aveda hair products; which, I love.&lt;br /&gt;-The texture is cool. It feels kind of glue-like, which sounds weird but I like it.&lt;br /&gt;-It makes my skin feel smoother.&lt;br /&gt;-You only need a tiny bit! So it will last a while. (I bought this a year or two ago and I have about half or more left).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-I haven&#x27;t really noticed much of a difference in times when I apply this and times when I don&#x27;t. It makes my skin feel smoother, but not much else.&lt;br /&gt;-I&#x27;ve tried it for an eyelid primer as well as face primer, and it doesn&#x27;t work too well. My eye shadow still creases. I have oily eyelids, so maybe nothing will really help with that.&lt;br /&gt;-Expensive... I paid about $30 for this on the Philosophy site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t quite recommend this, but I don&#x27;t not recommend it, either... I just love that scent! :P</li>
            <li> BEST primer out there. Last all day and keeps your make-up in place!</li>
            <li> Not sure if the formula was changed, but the primer doesn&#x27;t smell as nice or work as well as I remember.</li>
            <li> I love this pre-makeup cream.  It feels so smooth on my face.  I sometimes wear it without putting on foundation, it is  that good!  Highly recommend this.  Also, a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I purchased this product on a recommendation.  the first time I applied it, I used too much...it made my skin tacky...even after allowing it to set for 5 min. after application.  the trick to using this primer is this:  you only need a modest amount to get the desired affect. after applying, do allow it to set for a few minutes. then apply foundation (or powder if that&#x27;s your thing).  remember that by using this primer, it will minimize the amount of foundation you need...making your foundation purchase last longer.  this primer didn&#x27;t make my face look cakey when my makeup was worn, and it gave my foundation \\&quot;staying power\\&quot; through out the day.  easy to remove at night with your selected beauty regemin cleanser.  I will be purchasing Philosophy&#x27;s \\&quot;the present\\&quot; again in the future.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  My makeup stayed on so much longer and it was created such a nice smooth base for eyeshadow as well. You only need a pea size amount. Make sure to let it soak in for a couple of minutes before applying your base or it can create some sort of odd pastey-like substance when mixed with your foundation too early.</li>
            <li> this is to heavy for me, but I am not a makeup wearer, I though since it was Philosophy Iwould give it a try.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to try with a contouring style makeup. It was advertised to help with the contour look.&lt;br /&gt;I had tried contouring before purchasing this and had fairly decent results but I had read that a base like this one would help.  Not true.  This made my face dry and my makeup set in lines and cracks, making me appear much older.  I will not use this product again.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE Philosophy&#x27;s The Present!  It&#x27;s like glue! My makeup stays on all day &amp; all through the evening, &amp; it smooths lines &amp; wrinkles like a dream! I still use Skindinavia, &amp; I&#x27;m sure that helps makeup stay put as well, but The Present has made a HUGE difference.  I recommend waiting at least 5 minutes before applying your foundation.  It recommends 2 full minutes, but that wasn&#x27;t long enough, in my opinion, so I wait 5 minutes (sometimes longer) &amp; my foundation looks perfect all day long.  I would also recommend using this product sparingly.  A little bit goes a very long way &amp; using too much leaves your skin tacky &amp; makeup looking way less than perfect.  I would recommend using a smaller than pea-size amount.  The 2 ounces that you get will last a very, VERY long time.  I expect to purchase this once a year, because of the small amount that is required each use.  I&#x27;ve used about every primer out there, &amp; this is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever used &amp; I&#x27;ll continue to use this as long as they keep making it!</li>
            <li> The Present smooths over pores and small lines so they (almost) disappear. And it also keeps my liquid makeup from sliding off my face in the humid weather of the South. I&#x27;ve tried several other makeup primers that promise similar results, but The Present is the best I&#x27;ve found. It keeps my makeup fresh looking longer. The two reasons I didn&#x27;t rate it 5 stars: (1) it&#x27;s a bit expensive; but, in its defense, you only have to use a pea sized amount. And (2), it can make my dry skin flakey; however, I compensate by using a good moisturizer before applying The Present. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is the best yet, it is smooth, not oily and you don&#x27;t even need a powder to complete it.</li>
            <li> This really does work! I noticed a difference in my skin almost immediately. I will definitely purchase again. It shipped and arrived at my door quickly.</li>
            <li> I just love this clear makeup mostly b/c it fells and looks so natural on me. ^_^&lt;br /&gt;If I&#x27;m going for a no makeup look I use this, a little concealer and peach or very light pink lip and cheek coloring of some sort. I like to just use what ever I used on my lip on my cheeks and as a eye shadow too, for eyes if I do use anything dark I like to use a dark brown liner or mascara.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t do powder b/c most powders make my face feel itchy but just use something that matches ur skin then ur g2g. ^_^&lt;br /&gt;Please know this has no color it just makes ur skin look better</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this product in the past from QVC.  It was described as a clear foundation but I use it really as a primer,  It minimizes the appearance of fine line and wrinkles.  If your result is barely noticeable - trying going without it for a day.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It works well under make up and also when you don&#x27;t want to wear any make up.</li>
            <li> Love! It&#x27;s like spackle for my aging skin. Makes me appear poreless and wrinkle free</li>
            <li> Even with the age spots I have, this is a huge improvement over the other foundation I have used for years.  No build up in wrinkles and it really makes my skin look better!</li>
            <li> I can not believe how flawless this product makes my skin look.  I have been an avid foundation wearer.. even in the blistering heat of summer.  Since starting with The Present, I have changed to a layer of this.. and some powder on top for a nice matte finish.  I have tried double layering.. of course I did.. you know you were wondering about that!!  Definitely a no no.. makes for a more rubbery look and feel.  Stick with one thin layer and be a beautiful you!</li>
            <li> Love Phiosophy, just not this product. Opened and returned. Also, the packaging was sketchy...</li>
            <li> Love this product! I use it everyday after my cleansing steps.</li>
            <li> This stuff doesn&#x27;t hold a candle to Smashbox&#x27;s Photo Finish primer. I will still use Smashbox for important days, and just use this for other days until I run out, but I won&#x27;t be buying more. The feeling of The Present is very sticky/tacky whereas Smashbox&#x27;s Photo Finish goes on like air and then you don&#x27;t feel it, and makeup is smoother that way. Just wish Smashbox wasn&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this works well with my skin.  I used it as a base prior to putting make up on but I found it to be thick and cakey.  I also found small specks of flakes on my face after an hour.  I don&#x27;t know if it is the product itself or it just doesn&#x27;t fit well with my skin.</li>
            <li> I was also very excited to try this primer. I like philosophy products but this is just horrible for my skin. I have sensitive, oily and acne prone skin. Have been using it for 6 days and I have broken out after not having not even one pimple for months. Specially in the cheeks and chin area. I applied it, the consistancy was good liked that, let it dry over the 2 minutes and then applied my foundation. Really like how my foundation looked with this and it did not make me oily. But the BIG problem once again it made me brake out, so ladies dont waist your time if you have similar skin. I will continue on my quest for the best primer!!!</li>
            <li> This is the perfect primer... minimizes pores, controls shine, glues my foundation onto my face... which means no more makeup meltdown! I hear you should careful with this though... because the lavender oil can cause break-outs, but it seems totally fine on my face.</li>
            <li> This cream acts almost like a thin coat of paint primer.  It is very lightweight, but it does fill in those fine lines.</li>
            <li> I tried this product after reading some reviews that it is a good moisturizer/coverup for men.  It feels good going on, but as it dries it creates a slight ghostly white appearance to your beard area.  You can kinda rub it out but it just looks like you have dry skin or some type of white powder rubbed in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is expensive but I won&#x27;t return it yet and give it a few more days...unless a close friend asks me what&#x27;s on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does do what it says on the cheek, nose, and forehead area.  It smooths out pores, does not look oily...still some \\&quot;whitish\\&quot; quality to it.  I would think if you had black skin that it would look like you smeared something on your face...black guys beware!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But my skin is already very fair...so I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will an update in a couple weeks...if anyone is interested...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;17 January 2013 UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this for about 1 week.  It&#x27;s just OK.  It&#x27;s just a moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t make your face greasy.  Save your money...the rave reviews are overblown.  $28 for this...or $3 for a standard face moisturizer...same thing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No biggie...</li>
            <li> Sadly I tried this product. I tried it at Ulta before I bought it, thought it was great. Bought it from these guys, not only did it smell differently then the one from Ulta it didn&#x27;t make my skin feel amazing plus it made my skin break out! Do not buy this from this company</li>
            <li> I am a seventy nine year old (Lady), and love a product that does not make your aging lines look worse. I do not wear foundation or make up. Only a little cheek color, ege brows and lip color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the Present for a long time. It makes my face look healthy without the heavy make up.</li>
            <li> Once I put this on my face, my make-up does not move.  I can wear it from morning to evening and my foundation still looks present.  It gives a matte finish, although if you are oily, you may have some break through of oil.</li>
            <li> THE BEST makeup products I have ever used.  This is on my face every morning.  LOVE</li>
            <li> New to this product and product line.  Nice and thick covers nicely and has nice scent.  I do wait as others mention 10-15 minutes before applying makeup.  Satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 38 and have nice but oily skin.  I don&#x27;t like heavy foundation, just something light topped with a loose coat of powder to set it.  I&#x27;m a devotee of Philosophy and I LOVE the product \\&quot;The Supernatural\\&quot; which is my normal go-to.  Feeling like I wanted to try something new, I read the reviews for this makeup and thought I&#x27;d try it out.  First of all, maybe it&#x27;s just me but the first time I used it I got a HUGE glob of the stuff by only applying a little pressure to the tube.  I probably ended up wasting at least a weeks worth of the product just because of the poor design of the tube.  The product is thinnish and the hole was too big for the texture of it in my opinion.  Outside of that, once I put it on it made my skin very shiny, NOT dewy, which would have been fine.  I let it set the full two minutes as it said to do and then applied the supernatural over it along with some loose powder.  By the end of the day my face was very oily and looked bad.  I have tried the product alone and it is okay if you want a really bare face, but for me it leaves me greasy after a couple of hours.  Not good for my oily skin.</li>
            <li> Really did not care for this primer, it goes on sticky like. I have had and used better primer for my face.</li>
            <li> This is great when you dont want to wear foundation.  Makes your skin look less shiny and really hides imperfections.</li>
            <li> I  am very disappointed. I use this make up all the time, and usually buy it over the counter at Macy&#x27;s or Nordstroms. For convenience, I decided to order it on line. I just opened it, and it is old or spoiled or something. Clear liquid or water is running out of the tube, the make up is thin. I have never had to &amp;#34;shake&amp;#34; this stuff before to get it to mix and I don&#x27;t even know if shaking it will work. Will NOT buy makeup this way again!</li>
            <li> Usually philosophy products from amazon are just as good as those from sephora or even philosophy itself but not this time. This product came in a ziplock bag with a giant sticker with a new barcode over the one on the tube that also covered up part of the directions. The sticker over the directions, while annoying wasn&#x27;t a big deal, so I happily unpacked it and put it on my bathroom counter to use it in the morning. Morning came and I unscrewed the cap to take off the seal, everything going as expected. I screw the cap back on and turn it over to squeeze a bit into my hand and a bunch of watery-like liquid poured into my hand down into my sink.  I closed the top, shook it (btw, this isn&#x27;t how all my other tubes have worked, but ok maybe it&#x27;s a little old?). After shaking I opened, and squeezed...MORE watery liquid came out!!! This thing is now 3/4 EMPTY!!!! I finally was able to get some white creamy stuff out and it felt like I was applying Elmer&#x27;s glue to my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nope. Not buying this from this seller and maybe not from amazon ever again. Thanks for nothing.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several years. Philosophy cosmetics work well with my sken.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using This primer for about 3 years now &amp; I LOVE it!</li>
            <li> Came earlier than delivery date. No complaints. Great product for oily skin!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff even though it does make me look ashy. I never use it alone and always use yellow based bb creams, tinted foundations, etc so it doesn&#x27;t bother me. I have oily skin and this stuff really works especially when I do a full face. Although I do love this product I am willing to try something in cheaper price range because $29 is kinda of expensive for a product I use occasionally. I will do an experiment to see if there is really a tremendous difference between this and something else.</li>
            <li> This is a holy grail product for me. The first time I wore it (under a powder foundation), I had family members compliment me on how different and perfect my skin looked. You MUST give it the full 2 minutes to set before applying makeup. It just blurs all your imperfections! And it makes your skin so soft. You only need a very small amount, too, so the price is right because this will last you forever!</li>
            <li> It smells really bad!  Apart from that it&#x27;s good enough to wear alone but I have got quite good skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for ages, with a little gap in the middle when I was more inclined to use foundation on a daily basis. It does a great job of disguising pores, softening any fine lines, lessening shine, and giving a more even, smooth look. It&#x27;s not a miracle worker by any means, but for a bit more of a put-together everyday look, I really like it.</li>
            <li> Willing to bet people with issues didn&#x27;t follow the directions. You only need a dab. Most wait before applying makeup. In summer months I don&#x27;t use makeup. Just this stuff. A little powder. Lipstick. Mascara.</li>
            <li> The beat primer in the world to me, it stays on all day ,and your skin looks even al,over , I will forever buy this</li>
            <li> I love this.  I have dry, sensitive skin that is acne-prone.  I needed a primer that was healthy for my skin, would not clog pores but would hide them, and that would give me an airbrushed look.  This does all that.  It was made to be a \\&quot;second skin\\&quot; to seal in moisturizers and healing creams like scar-fade creams, and to keep out dirt, pollutants and anything else that could clog pores or aggravate your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This doesn&#x27;t break me out; it feels great on my skin; it seals in my moisturizer, sunscreen and dark spot fade cream (my medicine layer), and then I put this on, waiting the full 2 minutes for it to set, which is important.  Then I put m makeup on, knowing my makeup is sitting on this second skin of The Present.  The makeup goes on well, not falling into pores or tiny lines, and it stays put longer.  My makeup just looks better using this too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way - hard to do because the hole is quite large; squeeze gently so only a little comes out.</li>
            <li> Just o.k.....&lt;br /&gt;Gives a chalky finish, and seems to clog my pores.  Usually a big fan of Philosophy products, but no this one.</li>
            <li> I have been using this Philosophy product for years and was happy to find it on Amazon. It is a clear make-up and good for the skin. Hides all blemishes and/or wrinkles yet is not a heavy make-up. I wear it daily under make-up or just to cover my face and keep it smooth. Recommend it highly.,</li>
            <li> It does seem to work, but it is somewhat heavy in consistency and is not matte so I will not purchase it again.  I am oily/combo.</li>
            <li> This is the holy grail of primers. This is my first time trying Philosophy -- I&#x27;ll admit I was skeptical, but I&#x27;m so happy I went through with it. I use moisturizer then I apply this. Id skip the moisturizer if the Present had SPF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes me&lt;br /&gt;Skin feel so soft. A little goes a long way. Be careful when squeezing the bottle--you could end up with more than you&#x27;d like that. That&#x27;s the only downfall of this product. Everything else&lt;br /&gt;Is perfect. It does exactly what it says. I wear&lt;br /&gt;This alone with some blush and concealer and I&#x27;m good to go. It&#x27;s awesome. Light and not heavy. Try this!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had samples from Sephora a couple of times, but I could never justify the price ($30 at the store). I decided on a whim to see if the price would be the same on Amazon, and it was actually $5 cheaper! I instantly purchased and very happy with it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is cream based, and a little goes a long way (about dime size or less). It takes about 2-5 minutes to fully absorb in skin. My advice is not wear a moisturizer if you oily/combo skin. My daily routine is first, my Etude House Eye Cream (give 1 minute to absorb), PTR Oiless Oil (wait to absorb about 2 minutes), then apply The Present. After all that absorbs apply foundation, bb cream, or powder. This stuff really moisturizing on the skin and gives a really silky mattifying effect. Another tip - dab face with a tissue. Just light pats with a tissue or cotton pad to pick up an excess. My skin gets really oily so I have to be careful with cream based products. I love The Present.... but I&#x27;m always in the market for a better one to show up.</li>
            <li> not a good product leaves your face oily</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this product for very long, but I have seen that it works really well under my makeup. After a whole day my makeup looks much better with The Present underneath than without; my makeup &amp;#34;sticks&amp;#34; longer, and before I had problems that my forehead and nose-area would become very oily but this products has reduced that which makes me very happy! I have sensitive skin but I didn&#x27;t notice any irritation at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this primer underneath my cream foundations for about a month now. I&#x27;m 40ish, have the skin that goes along with the age, plus melasma. It does an excellent job as a primer, as long as you let it set up for several minutes. The directions say to give it two minutes, but honestly, you should give it more like 10 minutes. If you don&#x27;t let it set up/absorb properly, your foundation isn&#x27;t going to look as smooth, which completely defeats the purpose of using a primer. I knocked off a star because it contains lavender. This is not something you want on your skin if you&#x27;re going to be out in the sun as it causes photosensitivity... or in layman&#x27;s terms, possibly more sun spots. I&#x27;m not sure why Philosophy puts it in this product, but keep this in mind. It also has a rather large opening and little bit goes a long way. I end up wasting a bit because I inevitably end up squeezing out more than I need. Hopefully, Philosophy will change the hole size for better delivery/less waste. Other than that, it&#x27;s a great primer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple years and find that it consistently does just what I want it to do: smooth out any lines, blotches, uneven skin tones, etc., plus de-shines my face. It&#x27;s perfect alone or under powder.</li>
            <li> It is a pretty good primer, if you&#x27;re looking for one.  Personally, I love it.  The only drawback is if you&#x27;re allergic to lavender oil, it may not be the primer for you.  Oh and another thing, you have to wait literally 5-10 minutes for it to dry on your face before applying makeup.  Wait time of less than 5 minutes will result in a ruined foundation.  Trust me!  It is worth the wait time!</li>
            <li> I really like this product and would recommend it to anyone. Really sucks the shine off the centre of my face and did not cause me to break out.</li>
            <li> Some of you have flocked to order this after Wayne Goss&#x27;s review like I did. In short, it&#x27;s a good primer, and it does help my bare minerals stay on a little longer than with other primers, but it isn&#x27;t as great as he was doting over it in his video. I may or may not repurchase because I have better primers much better suited to my combination skin. This primer does nothing for controlling sebum.</li>
            <li> Makeup breaks down about 4 hours after wear. Smells and feels great, applies nicely enough, however, I have Very Oily skin, and unfortunately, The Present did not hold up to my expectations...</li>
            <li> I loved it for myself!&lt;br /&gt;However, the smell kind of put me off at first. Also the feel of it is like glue in a way.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this as a cheaper alternative and maybe only for a night out.&lt;br /&gt;You get more than what you pay for, for sure. A lot of product for a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;I will be buying this again!</li>
            <li> The make up was very thin and did not last long.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a makeup primer, which it works ok for, but my skin is looking and feeling dry and tight.  I moisturize as usual but when I apply my foundation it &amp;#34;grabs&amp;#34; after applying the primer.  May be better for the summer months.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Philosophy products are over priced but this one is worth its price. It makes my skin have a smooth finish. I am in my 40&#x27;s and can go out without makeup when wearing this. It doesn&#x27;t cover all of the lines but gives an overall smooth finish.</li>
            <li> This product is very thick. You only need a little bit all over your face for long lasting makeup. Even on super hot, humid days, this makeup base holds up to the test. Because you only need a little bit of it, this tube will last you a very very long time. For that, the price isn&#x27;t bad. You will need to learn how much you need for your face because if you put too much, it&#x27;ll almost feel like you have a very thick layer of glue on your face. It feels weird.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it has a weird sort of smell to it. I mean, it&#x27;s not absolutely terrible, but it&#x27;s not that great either. Kind of reminds me of glue, lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I really like this stuff. Because I only use a little bit everyday, it&#x27;s going to last me for a long time so that&#x27;s always a plus.</li>
