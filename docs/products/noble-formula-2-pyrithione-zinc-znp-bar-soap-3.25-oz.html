            <li>lol....</li>
            <li>Great Product.</li>
            <li>Both Soaps have a neutral scent, which is great for me.  </li>
            <li>Zinc bars are great for those of us with allergies, but hey you guys - a lot of</li>
            <li>This stuff is great</li>
            <li>ZNP worked great.  </li>
            <li>Great product, but no longer produced by the manufacturer.</li>
            <li>Time saving, effective, and affordable!</li>
            <li>with good results.  </li>
            <li>Since ZNP bar soap can no longer be purchased, Nobel Formula is a good replacement.</li>
            <li>it had good reviews and had Amazon cash to spend) and have used it for a week each time I have showered in the morning.</li>
            <li>After using it for 3 weeks, i have not notices any change in the condition, so I can&#x27;t give it a good critique.</li>
            <li>The soap works really good</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t kill you, but it doesn&#x27;t look good when you are in swimming suit.  </li>
            <li>Good for seborrheic dermatitis on face.</li>
            <li>This is a welcome relief, because my skin is hyper-sensitive and I&#x27;m allergic to most soaps and shampoos.</li>
            <li>Very glad I found this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this is a great product</li>
            <li>but all good now with the Noble Soap.</li>
            <li>One use &amp; the summer itchy,dry skin felt so much better!  </li>
            <li>This stuff is pretty awesome.  </li>
            <li>The soap is doing an amazing job to my skin (face).  </li>
            <li>Its amazing.</li>
            <li>it means no detergents.&lt;br /&gt;Truly an amazing product.</li>
            <li>I ordered the Noble 2% pyrithione zinc soap bar because Steiffel discontinued their ZNP soap bar.  </li>
            <li>and I bought the noble formula</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although it&#x27;s effective, I think I will try something else when it&#x27;s over.</li>
            <li>This would be a 5-star product if it weren&#x27;t for that darned oatmeal which I suppose must serve some kind of a constructive function.</li>
            <li>I feel it is caused by a mold or spore that emerges in the warm weather, probably in the grass.  </li>
            <li>Everyone recommended Noble Formula because it has Pyrithione Zinc like ZNP.</li>
            <li>My Dr told me that zinc was very good for my skin, and its been working very good along with other products.</li>
            <li>This year I wanted to give my liver a break from the nizoral since it&#x27;s very strong.</li>
            <li>The cream was not heavy and greasy, but did a great job!</li>
            <li>The soap has a very light, almost non existent, smell.</li>
            <li>He continues to use this soap and is pleased with the result.</li>
            <li>The fact most do not know about seborrheic dermatitis, and or psoriasis can both be caused by one issue or a combination of symptoms.</li>
            <li>I used cortisone cream for the most part, but it never worked in the long-term.</li>
            <li>I started using lotions and creams, but nothing made me skin better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the ZNP bar on and off before, many years ago, to treat seborrhea eczema.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s &amp;#34;magic&amp;#34;.  &#x3D; )</li>
            <li>So, I decided to try one more product</li>
            <li>I love about this soap?&lt;br /&gt;That</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love about this soap?&lt;br /&gt;That</li>
            <li>I love seeing no lather....</li>
            <li>Outstanding product.</li>
            <li>but it appears to work ok.  </li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t really work that great.</li>
            <li>I have had tinea versicolor for many years.  </li>
            <li>I am well pleased with this soap and will keep using it.</li>
            <li>I wish I had ordered more.</li>
            <li>It is excellent for rosacea, for skin irritation, for dermatitis of all kinds including fungus, scalp dermatitis as well and even, believe it or not for dry skin.  </li>
            <li>Nice product, does good things for my skin, and I struggle with adult acne (including back-ne).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle and pleasant, with a light oatmeal fragrance and no chemical smell.</li>
            <li>my skin is irritated easily, though i don&#x27;t have psoriasis/eczema.</li>
            <li>I can tell it is medicated and can easily believe it could help someone with skin problems not on their face.</li>
            <li>The first time I used the soap, I thought it had a nice smell.</li>
            <li>Mild &amp; creamy, but I can&#x27;t say it improved my rosacea any, &amp; I prefer a more moisturizing cream wash.</li>
            <li>How about a nice pure zinc bar without the allergens?&lt;br /&gt;Please?</li>
            <li>The 2% Pyrithione Zinc Bar Soap is gentle and yet effective.</li>
            <li>THis product is fantastic.</li>
            <li>So, thank you for your great product, and I plan to keep purchasing from you in the future.</li>
            <li>It worked much faster than Noble Formula, however, I did experience burning and stinging from it.  </li>
            <li>its smell is so light I don&#x27;t even notice the smell.&lt;br</li>
            <li>When combined with a exfoliating sponge, the results are fantastic.</li>
            <li>Working great after only 3 weeks!</li>
            <li>I have purchased both this DemaZinc soap and Noble formula soap, and both seam to work well, but not quite as fast as the prescription selenium shampoo.  </li>
            <li>and now I don&#x27;t thanks to Noble Formula.</li>
            <li>Since we&#x27;re all too busy to do that, it&#x27;s good to know the skin relief has continued on through the 1st 24 hrs.</li>
            <li>Even just for general use, it is a very nice soap that is fragrance free but leaves your skin nourished and clean.</li>
            <li>great product, very satisfied , will order some more in the future and will definitely recommend the soap to all my friends and family.&lt;br /&gt;a</li>
            <li>Decided I would see for myself and so far I am very satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with this product thus far and definitely recommend you give it a try if you have skin experiences like mine.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe that after using perscription meds for so long, this works better than all of them!!</li>
            <li>Good purchase overall!</li>
            <li>I wanted the Zinc content for my skin and thought the vegan ingredients would be a nice natural exfoliant.</li>
            <li>Maybe for someone with a mild case of tinea versicolor, this would work, but it did not work for me.</li>
            <li>it shrinks quickly.</li>
            <li>In my case, it was mild redness around the cheeks/nose, on the forehead, and chin with flaking.</li>
            <li>Giving it 3 stars anyway because the smell was pleasant, it seemed moisturizing/ did not leave skin dry, and from the way it made my face burn</li>
            <li>I got to hear this soap from dr oz for the very first time.</li>
            <li>and I found this soap too strong to use there, it stung too much.</li>
            <li>I could use a washcloth, but the oatmeal pieces were large and would break free, leaving me to either pick them out or scratch my skin with them.</li>
            <li>Only drawback is I wish the oatmeal were more finely ground.  </li>
            <li>I figured it was worth a try.</li>
            <li>My husband has had sensitive skin for many years.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every</li>
            <li>I would recommend using those in the shower, even letting them sit on your affect skin, and use the Noble Formula soap bar for a twice-daily facial wash separate from your shower.</li>
            <li>I gave this product a try for my facial rosacea, and I have to say it is effective in controlling redness/blemishes.</li>
            <li>However, I never had skin that was so sensitive that I couldn&#x27;t even use the most \\&quot;gentle\\&quot; cleansers on it.</li>
            <li>but its worth a try.</li>
            <li>So far we both love this product and would buy it again.</li>
            <li>A friend said they have been using the zinc based soap with success, so I thought I would try it out.  </li>
            <li>The Noble regimen of soap and cream have helped me immensely</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for eczema and other skin conditions, but I use it for acne purposes.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m back to normal, enjoying the outdoors and am free off the dreaded itch!</li>
            <li>WHo knew right?</li>
            <li>Under the right conditions of moist and oily skin, it starts growing again.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t suds much, but it leaves my skin feeling clean.</li>
            <li>I love it, does not strip the skin, has a mild exfoliation to it and leaves skin feeling so soft and ready for the day.</li>
            <li>No, it will not work as quickly as prescription strength selenium sulfide, but it works much better than the low dose of selenium sulfide found in dandruff shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I loved them both, they worked very well with my very dry skin.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my face feeling soft and smooth, although not as clean as I could like it to feel, but I am just very picky with how I want my skin to feel.</li>
            <li>It worked better at controlling my flaking red skin</li>
            <li>But, I would suggest ordering this out of a hot season.  </li>
            <li>I thought for sure that I had Seborrheic Dermatitis (and I still have an appointment with a derm to see what is going on next week), so I started to feel hopeless.</li>
            <li>Thanks a million!</li>
            <li>The Noble soap bar does not create much lather but it does seem to be helping my dry skin.  </li>
            <li>The soap has such large chunks, that it is more scratchy than exfoliating.  </li>
            <li>Those are pretty much the basics of skin maintenance but, for those of us who are extra challenged its more important.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>it leaves my skin clean and oil free every single time and for hours.&lt;br</li>
            <li>has pretty much cleared it all up...</li>
            <li>that really works and for sure will buy again, Thanks and I will purchase again in the future.</li>
            <li>Pleasant smell too, and last a very long time.</li>
            <li>Of course do not forget with anything the body develops its own counteraction to everything you give it if given too often so at first the instinct is to use it everyday.</li>
            <li>I plan to order a few more bars!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this Noble Formula soap twice daily for several days now, and I already see a positive difference in my complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it REALLY dries it out.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t see much of a difference in my eczema after using this.</li>
            <li>Got very slimy aswell, I may have bought it in store again but not online</li>
            <li>I would never put this bar of soap to my face, and I grimace when I rub the soap between my hands because the oatmeal chunks hurt the palms of my hands so much.</li>
            <li>use to really show up when i shaved</li>
            <li>You really can&#x27;t get rid of it.  </li>
            <li>There is too much oatmeal in this soap.</li>
            <li>My forehead and eyelids do not flake as much as they did before I started using this soap.  </li>
            <li>used to have really flaky skin on my face w/</li>
            <li>Either that or I was using so much lotion to keep it from drying out that the lotion was breaking me out.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I especially like the way it rinses so clean from the skin.</li>
            <li>The soap is now discontinued and  impossible to find .It was wonderful to locate a replacement remedy I needed on Amazon with their suggestions.  </li>
            <li>particular product is unscented and I have not had any allergic reaction to it</li>
            <li>Noble Formula is supposed to have other properties not found in regular zinc therapy soap, but I have no knowledge of those properties.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also really economical, despite the initial cost.</li>
            <li>a side note, I don&#x27;t wish to be required to write more than a few words, as a vendor could you share that with Amazon?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I plan to order a few more</li>
            <li>I did not notice any improvement in the condition from the soap,but this could be partly because I could not use it more than a few times because of the stinging.</li>
            <li>Now I am worried and I stopped to use that new soap.  </li>
            <li>From the first day I used it, I noticed a big difference.</li>
            <li>If your doctor had prescribed ZNP in the past, this is a better replacement for it.</li>
            <li>Does not dry your skin out at all and very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 30 years old now and for the first time in 15 years I can finally see my face.</li>
            <li>I first started noticing flaky white skin on both sides of my nose in early 2011.</li>
            <li>My face didn&#x27;t feel tight today, and I felt confident enough to leave my house.</li>
            <li>I bought this purely to treat the tinea versicolor I get on my upper arms and chest.  </li>
            <li>Everyone complements my on how clear my complexion is now.</li>
            <li>I do this maybe 2-3 times a week, and it did clear up my tinea versicolor.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m clear.</li>
            <li>and I did notice that it helped clear up some of my flare ups</li>
            <li>So far, so good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This soap was recomended to my father by his doctor for some skin irritation he developed.</li>
            <li>However, make sure to use it at least twice a day.  </li>
            <li>I used this every day until it was completely gone and did not notice a change at all.</li>
            <li>So far it works though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I switched to Burt&#x27;s Bees sensitive skin cleanser in hopes that it would help relieve my skin.</li>
            <li>Overall I like it and will probably buy a few more bars.</li>
            <li>Most of the products he used to bath with would leave his face with a red rash which often turned scaly and raw looking.  </li>
            <li>Gentle enough to calm down my flaky SD, but not so oily that I breakout.  </li>
            <li>There were a few dry patches, but not anywhere NEAR as many as I had before.</li>
            <li>However, after a few more months I noticed that my face had returned to being cracked and dry.</li>
            <li>Three years ago I gave birth to my son, and my entire body chemistry changed, as I know that it certainly can after such hormonal changes.</li>
            <li>Mine doesn&#x27;t look too extreme, but it is very, very stubborn.</li>
            <li>I had been using proactive for years and it made my skin so dry and didn&#x27;t really seem to help with my acne.   </li>
            <li>but I thought I would give it a few more tries.  </li>
            <li>Nothing major.</li>
            <li>The oatmeal is too large a grind size - there are rough</li>
            <li>The generally works.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only begun to try it, so I&#x27;m hoping with continuous use, the eczema will completely disappear.  </li>
            <li>The soap is much smaller than I was expecting, but so far it has been working well and has helped prevent flaking since I changed up my skin care routine.</li>
            <li>This soap did not work as fast as I expected, based on some reviews I read through searching the web.  </li>
            <li>Also soap seems to melt down by water easy, gets mushy on outside when wet.</li>
            <li>I have not used it that much, so for me the oatmeal chunks other people have commented on has not become an issue</li>
            <li>and it is a bit expensive, but it ensures that I have clear and healthy looking skin.</li>
            <li>Most of the market items \\&quot;designed to treat\\&quot; the issue actually make it worse.</li>
            <li>It cleans my skin and does not dry it out.  </li>
            <li>The only other place I&#x27;ve found 2% Pyrithione Zinc is in certain brands of Head and Shoulders shampoo products.</li>
            <li>I think the grains are too coarse and tend to scratch my skin instead of doing much general surface exfoliation.  </li>
            <li>Other products like ZNP contain blue color and alcohol (very drying to skin).</li>
            <li>There is a tiny bit of the white flakiness on one side of my nose left, but my chin, eyebrows, and behind are ears and smooth and normal again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Soft soap which has healing effect for dry skin</li>
            <li>It cleanses very well, but its not super moisturizing for my skin.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> it had good reviews and had Amazon cash to spend) and have used it for a week each time I have showered in the morning.</li>
            <li> After using it for 3 weeks, i have not notices any change in the condition, so I can&#x27;t give it a good critique.</li>
            <li> The soap works really good</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t kill you, but it doesn&#x27;t look good when you are in swimming suit.  </li>
            <li> Good for seborrheic dermatitis on face.</li>
            <li> This is a welcome relief, because my skin is hyper-sensitive and I&#x27;m allergic to most soaps and shampoos.</li>
            <li> Very glad I found this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this is a great product</li>
            <li> but all good now with the Noble Soap.</li>
            <li> One use &amp; the summer itchy,dry skin felt so much better!  </li>
            <li> This stuff is pretty awesome.  </li>
            <li> The soap is doing an amazing job to my skin (face).  </li>
            <li> Its amazing.</li>
            <li> it means no detergents.&lt;br /&gt;Truly an amazing product.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Noble 2% pyrithione zinc soap bar because Steiffel discontinued their ZNP soap bar.  </li>
            <li> and I bought the noble formula</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although it&#x27;s effective, I think I will try something else when it&#x27;s over.</li>
            <li> This would be a 5-star product if it weren&#x27;t for that darned oatmeal which I suppose must serve some kind of a constructive function.</li>
            <li> I feel it is caused by a mold or spore that emerges in the warm weather, probably in the grass.  </li>
            <li> Everyone recommended Noble Formula because it has Pyrithione Zinc like ZNP.</li>
            <li> My Dr told me that zinc was very good for my skin, and its been working very good along with other products.</li>
            <li> This year I wanted to give my liver a break from the nizoral since it&#x27;s very strong.</li>
            <li> The cream was not heavy and greasy, but did a great job!</li>
            <li> The soap has a very light, almost non existent, smell.</li>
            <li> He continues to use this soap and is pleased with the result.</li>
            <li> The fact most do not know about seborrheic dermatitis, and or psoriasis can both be caused by one issue or a combination of symptoms.</li>
            <li> I used cortisone cream for the most part, but it never worked in the long-term.</li>
            <li> I started using lotions and creams, but nothing made me skin better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the ZNP bar on and off before, many years ago, to treat seborrhea eczema.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s &amp;#34;magic&amp;#34;.  &#x3D; )</li>
            <li> So, I decided to try one more product</li>
            <li> I love about this soap?&lt;br /&gt;That</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love about this soap?&lt;br /&gt;That</li>
            <li> I love seeing no lather....</li>
            <li> Outstanding product.</li>
            <li> but it appears to work ok.  </li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t really work that great.</li>
            <li> I have had tinea versicolor for many years.  </li>
            <li> I am well pleased with this soap and will keep using it.</li>
            <li> I wish I had ordered more.</li>
            <li> It is excellent for rosacea, for skin irritation, for dermatitis of all kinds including fungus, scalp dermatitis as well and even, believe it or not for dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Nice product, does good things for my skin, and I struggle with adult acne (including back-ne).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle and pleasant, with a light oatmeal fragrance and no chemical smell.</li>
            <li> my skin is irritated easily, though i don&#x27;t have psoriasis/eczema.</li>
            <li> I can tell it is medicated and can easily believe it could help someone with skin problems not on their face.</li>
            <li> The first time I used the soap, I thought it had a nice smell.</li>
            <li> Mild &amp; creamy, but I can&#x27;t say it improved my rosacea any, &amp; I prefer a more moisturizing cream wash.</li>
            <li> How about a nice pure zinc bar without the allergens?&lt;br /&gt;Please?</li>
            <li> The 2% Pyrithione Zinc Bar Soap is gentle and yet effective.</li>
            <li> THis product is fantastic.</li>
            <li> So, thank you for your great product, and I plan to keep purchasing from you in the future.</li>
            <li> It worked much faster than Noble Formula, however, I did experience burning and stinging from it.  </li>
            <li> its smell is so light I don&#x27;t even notice the smell.&lt;br</li>
            <li> When combined with a exfoliating sponge, the results are fantastic.</li>
            <li> Working great after only 3 weeks!</li>
            <li> I have purchased both this DemaZinc soap and Noble formula soap, and both seam to work well, but not quite as fast as the prescription selenium shampoo.  </li>
            <li> and now I don&#x27;t thanks to Noble Formula.</li>
            <li> Since we&#x27;re all too busy to do that, it&#x27;s good to know the skin relief has continued on through the 1st 24 hrs.</li>
            <li> Even just for general use, it is a very nice soap that is fragrance free but leaves your skin nourished and clean.</li>
            <li> great product, very satisfied , will order some more in the future and will definitely recommend the soap to all my friends and family.&lt;br /&gt;a</li>
            <li> Decided I would see for myself and so far I am very satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with this product thus far and definitely recommend you give it a try if you have skin experiences like mine.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe that after using perscription meds for so long, this works better than all of them!!</li>
            <li> Good purchase overall!</li>
            <li> I wanted the Zinc content for my skin and thought the vegan ingredients would be a nice natural exfoliant.</li>
            <li> Maybe for someone with a mild case of tinea versicolor, this would work, but it did not work for me.</li>
            <li> it shrinks quickly.</li>
            <li> In my case, it was mild redness around the cheeks/nose, on the forehead, and chin with flaking.</li>
            <li> Giving it 3 stars anyway because the smell was pleasant, it seemed moisturizing/ did not leave skin dry, and from the way it made my face burn</li>
            <li> I got to hear this soap from dr oz for the very first time.</li>
            <li> and I found this soap too strong to use there, it stung too much.</li>
            <li> I could use a washcloth, but the oatmeal pieces were large and would break free, leaving me to either pick them out or scratch my skin with them.</li>
            <li> Only drawback is I wish the oatmeal were more finely ground.  </li>
            <li> I figured it was worth a try.</li>
            <li> My husband has had sensitive skin for many years.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth every</li>
            <li> I would recommend using those in the shower, even letting them sit on your affect skin, and use the Noble Formula soap bar for a twice-daily facial wash separate from your shower.</li>
            <li> I gave this product a try for my facial rosacea, and I have to say it is effective in controlling redness/blemishes.</li>
            <li> However, I never had skin that was so sensitive that I couldn&#x27;t even use the most \\&quot;gentle\\&quot; cleansers on it.</li>
            <li> but its worth a try.</li>
            <li> So far we both love this product and would buy it again.</li>
            <li> A friend said they have been using the zinc based soap with success, so I thought I would try it out.  </li>
            <li> The Noble regimen of soap and cream have helped me immensely</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for eczema and other skin conditions, but I use it for acne purposes.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m back to normal, enjoying the outdoors and am free off the dreaded itch!</li>
            <li> WHo knew right?</li>
            <li> Under the right conditions of moist and oily skin, it starts growing again.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t suds much, but it leaves my skin feeling clean.</li>
            <li> I love it, does not strip the skin, has a mild exfoliation to it and leaves skin feeling so soft and ready for the day.</li>
            <li> No, it will not work as quickly as prescription strength selenium sulfide, but it works much better than the low dose of selenium sulfide found in dandruff shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I loved them both, they worked very well with my very dry skin.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my face feeling soft and smooth, although not as clean as I could like it to feel, but I am just very picky with how I want my skin to feel.</li>
            <li> It worked better at controlling my flaking red skin</li>
            <li> But, I would suggest ordering this out of a hot season.  </li>
            <li> I thought for sure that I had Seborrheic Dermatitis (and I still have an appointment with a derm to see what is going on next week), so I started to feel hopeless.</li>
            <li> Thanks a million!</li>
            <li> The Noble soap bar does not create much lather but it does seem to be helping my dry skin.  </li>
            <li> The soap has such large chunks, that it is more scratchy than exfoliating.  </li>
            <li> Those are pretty much the basics of skin maintenance but, for those of us who are extra challenged its more important.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> it leaves my skin clean and oil free every single time and for hours.&lt;br</li>
            <li> has pretty much cleared it all up...</li>
            <li> that really works and for sure will buy again, Thanks and I will purchase again in the future.</li>
            <li> Pleasant smell too, and last a very long time.</li>
            <li> Of course do not forget with anything the body develops its own counteraction to everything you give it if given too often so at first the instinct is to use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I plan to order a few more bars!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Noble Formula soap twice daily for several days now, and I already see a positive difference in my complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it REALLY dries it out.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see much of a difference in my eczema after using this.</li>
            <li> Got very slimy aswell, I may have bought it in store again but not online</li>
            <li> I would never put this bar of soap to my face, and I grimace when I rub the soap between my hands because the oatmeal chunks hurt the palms of my hands so much.</li>
            <li> use to really show up when i shaved</li>
            <li> You really can&#x27;t get rid of it.  </li>
            <li> There is too much oatmeal in this soap.</li>
            <li> My forehead and eyelids do not flake as much as they did before I started using this soap.  </li>
            <li> used to have really flaky skin on my face w/</li>
            <li> Either that or I was using so much lotion to keep it from drying out that the lotion was breaking me out.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I especially like the way it rinses so clean from the skin.</li>
            <li> The soap is now discontinued and  impossible to find .It was wonderful to locate a replacement remedy I needed on Amazon with their suggestions.  </li>
            <li> particular product is unscented and I have not had any allergic reaction to it</li>
            <li> Noble Formula is supposed to have other properties not found in regular zinc therapy soap, but I have no knowledge of those properties.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also really economical, despite the initial cost.</li>
            <li> a side note, I don&#x27;t wish to be required to write more than a few words, as a vendor could you share that with Amazon?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I plan to order a few more</li>
            <li> I did not notice any improvement in the condition from the soap,but this could be partly because I could not use it more than a few times because of the stinging.</li>
            <li> Now I am worried and I stopped to use that new soap.  </li>
            <li> From the first day I used it, I noticed a big difference.</li>
            <li> If your doctor had prescribed ZNP in the past, this is a better replacement for it.</li>
            <li> Does not dry your skin out at all and very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 30 years old now and for the first time in 15 years I can finally see my face.</li>
            <li> I first started noticing flaky white skin on both sides of my nose in early 2011.</li>
            <li> My face didn&#x27;t feel tight today, and I felt confident enough to leave my house.</li>
            <li> I bought this purely to treat the tinea versicolor I get on my upper arms and chest.  </li>
            <li> Everyone complements my on how clear my complexion is now.</li>
            <li> I do this maybe 2-3 times a week, and it did clear up my tinea versicolor.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m clear.</li>
            <li> and I did notice that it helped clear up some of my flare ups</li>
            <li> So far, so good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This soap was recomended to my father by his doctor for some skin irritation he developed.</li>
            <li> However, make sure to use it at least twice a day.  </li>
            <li> I used this every day until it was completely gone and did not notice a change at all.</li>
            <li> So far it works though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I switched to Burt&#x27;s Bees sensitive skin cleanser in hopes that it would help relieve my skin.</li>
            <li> Overall I like it and will probably buy a few more bars.</li>
            <li> Most of the products he used to bath with would leave his face with a red rash which often turned scaly and raw looking.  </li>
            <li> Gentle enough to calm down my flaky SD, but not so oily that I breakout.  </li>
            <li> There were a few dry patches, but not anywhere NEAR as many as I had before.</li>
            <li> However, after a few more months I noticed that my face had returned to being cracked and dry.</li>
            <li> Three years ago I gave birth to my son, and my entire body chemistry changed, as I know that it certainly can after such hormonal changes.</li>
            <li> Mine doesn&#x27;t look too extreme, but it is very, very stubborn.</li>
            <li> I had been using proactive for years and it made my skin so dry and didn&#x27;t really seem to help with my acne.   </li>
            <li> but I thought I would give it a few more tries.  </li>
            <li> Nothing major.</li>
            <li> The oatmeal is too large a grind size - there are rough</li>
            <li> The generally works.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only begun to try it, so I&#x27;m hoping with continuous use, the eczema will completely disappear.  </li>
            <li> The soap is much smaller than I was expecting, but so far it has been working well and has helped prevent flaking since I changed up my skin care routine.</li>
            <li> This soap did not work as fast as I expected, based on some reviews I read through searching the web.  </li>
            <li> Also soap seems to melt down by water easy, gets mushy on outside when wet.</li>
            <li> I have not used it that much, so for me the oatmeal chunks other people have commented on has not become an issue</li>
            <li> and it is a bit expensive, but it ensures that I have clear and healthy looking skin.</li>
            <li> Most of the market items \\&quot;designed to treat\\&quot; the issue actually make it worse.</li>
            <li> It cleans my skin and does not dry it out.  </li>
            <li> The only other place I&#x27;ve found 2% Pyrithione Zinc is in certain brands of Head and Shoulders shampoo products.</li>
            <li> I think the grains are too coarse and tend to scratch my skin instead of doing much general surface exfoliation.  </li>
            <li> Other products like ZNP contain blue color and alcohol (very drying to skin).</li>
            <li> There is a tiny bit of the white flakiness on one side of my nose left, but my chin, eyebrows, and behind are ears and smooth and normal again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Soft soap which has healing effect for dry skin</li>
            <li> It cleanses very well, but its not super moisturizing for my skin.  </li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;ve been using Noble Formula for a few months it has definitely decreased the bumps.  </li>
            <li> Well, after ONE wash my face was noticeably smoother and less red to the point where it looked completely normal (compared to the rest of my face).</li>
            <li> the one downside is it&#x27;s a little high in pH,</li>
            <li> For a long time, since I was in middle school, I have had issues with my face.</li>
            <li> Actually I think the oatmeal should be in there only for skin moisturizing and soothing benefits - if I want facial exfoliation, I would like to use a separate product for that other than a bar soap.</li>
            <li> Also, this soap is exfoliating and moisturizing, unlike the ZNP bar, so not only does it treat the itching and flaking, but it also doesn&#x27;t leave me dry.  </li>
            <li> I use to have a lot of facial dry skin and using every day</li>
            <li> have only used this a few times so far, but it seems to work well</li>
            <li> The soap is also extremely soft and slimy and the bar started wanting to fall apart after only a few uses.</li>
            <li> I developed facial excema a few years a ago.  </li>
            <li> You feel better due to it not feeling dry but in appearance it in fact looks worse due to</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s very itchy and hard, and I look like a leopard.</li>
            <li> (Suggest not letting the bar soak in the water -  just briefly dampen it, rub it onto a wet wash cloth, and use the cloth to apply the soap.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line?</li>
            <li> After one or two uses the coarse oatmeal is as rough as a metal rasp.</li>
            <li> The soap itself has no fragrance and leaves an odd sort of film feeling on your skin after use if you don&#x27;t wash it off too vigorously, but I&#x27;ve had no other side effects.</li>
            <li> but it just dried my skin out too much and made it feel really tight.</li>
            <li> As you see certain lotions and so forth can actually make it worse if containing alcohol and others</li>
            <li> Not a big difference to any other soap.</li>
            <li> My only other relief was applications Zeasorb Powder and washing with ZNP zinc Soap.</li>
            <li> It has done wonders for my Eczema or Psoriasis, and dry patchy skin.</li>
            <li> I am ordering another bar for my daughter to use, as she has Atopic Dermatitis .....severely dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have suffered from dry skin ever since I can remember.</li>
            <li> At the time I was using Aveeno calming foam cleaner, and it caused my face to dry and crack.</li>
            <li> searching, I found that zinc was listed as an ingredient for people with dry and irritated skin.</li>
            <li> Morning is when my skin looks best..until I shower and it becomes dry and flaky again.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin, and both soaps, used as both shampoo and body bar, leave my skin moisturized.  </li>
            <li> This product is not suitable for sensitive skin in any area of the body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would like to add a little background about my skin condition before I get to the actual review of the product.</li>
            <li> This is kinda gross to use, little bits of oats in the bar</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still using the same bar that I reviewed above, and it has hardly shrunk at all.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;exfoliant\\&quot; is way too harsh for your skin, and I&#x27;ve used a facial loofah for years.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, and changes to my routine usually make me break out a lot, and many products dry out my skin very badly.</li>
            <li> I have eczema due to stress.</li>
            <li> No more constant itching, and the roughness has disappeared.</li>
            <li> Helped him get thru the shower without scratching up his skin due to that irritation.</li>
            <li> Mine personally is caused by the fact my face creates an excessive amount of lubricant for the skin.</li>
            <li> I usually take the Nizoral pill and do the sweat treatment to get rid of my tinea, but it comes back every summer.</li>
            <li> Over the past year I have lost 45 lbs by working out on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> other users had to say  about this product.</li>
            <li> No discernible benefit from the other ingredients.</li>
            <li> allergic folks are also allergic to oats and wheat and the other stuff</li>
            <li> Only negatives are its small for the price</li>
            <li> Would buy again.a little expensive, but worth the money.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have eczema due to stress. And it&#x27;s very itchy and hard, and I look like a leopard. Thank goodness it&#x27;s where it can&#x27;t  be seen. Nothing else I tried, worked well at all. I read the reviews for this soap and thought I&#x27;d give it a try. It works! From the first day I used it, I noticed a big difference. No more constant itching, and the roughness has disappeared. I&#x27;ve only begun to try it, so I&#x27;m hoping with continuous use, the eczema will completely disappear.  UPDATE!!--I&#x27;ve just received my second bar. Looks like this soap is a keeper. It has done wonders for my Eczema or Psoriasis, and dry patchy skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this after my dermatologist suggested for me to use it a couple times a week in stead of my regular facial cleanser. I have very sensitive skin, and changes to my routine usually make me break out a lot, and many products dry out my skin very badly. I figured it was worth a try. The soap is much smaller than I was expecting, but so far it has been working well and has helped prevent flaking since I changed up my skin care routine. I have not used it that much, so for me the oatmeal chunks other people have commented on has not become an issue yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this over the emu version, because the thought of putting animal fats on my faced was just not appealing to me. The soap has a very light, almost non existent, smell. It leaves my face feeling soft and smooth, although not as clean as I could like it to feel, but I am just very picky with how I want my skin to feel. I think I will definitely buy this again and keep it on hand for those cold winter months when I am prone to flaky, dry skin!</li>
            <li> This is a great bar of zinc soap.  It worked better at controlling my flaking red skin then my prescription cream I got  from my doctor/drugstore. I am so happy I gave this a try.  It works great for me and my family.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist suggested the use of pyrithione zinc soap to treat candida albicans. I&#x27;ve been using this Noble Formula soap twice daily for several days now, and I already see a positive difference in my complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular product is unscented and I have not had any allergic reaction to it whatever. This is a welcome relief, because my skin is hyper-sensitive and I&#x27;m allergic to most soaps and shampoos. So far, so good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for an update.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this soap twice a day for almost 3 months and still no allergic reaction. It&#x27;s gentle and pleasant, with a light oatmeal fragrance and no chemical smell. It doesn&#x27;t suds much, but it leaves my skin feeling clean. It&#x27;s also really economical, despite the initial cost. I&#x27;m still using the same bar that I reviewed above, and it has hardly shrunk at all. (Suggest not letting the bar soak in the water -  just briefly dampen it, rub it onto a wet wash cloth, and use the cloth to apply the soap.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line? Very pleased!</li>
            <li> Nice product, does good things for my skin, and I struggle with adult acne (including back-ne).  Only drawback is I wish the oatmeal were more finely ground.  I think the grains are too coarse and tend to scratch my skin instead of doing much general surface exfoliation.  Actually I think the oatmeal should be in there only for skin moisturizing and soothing benefits - if I want facial exfoliation, I would like to use a separate product for that other than a bar soap.</li>
            <li> Great for kids with Acne and sensative skin.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this product to treat rosacea (spelling?) with good results.  Approximately four years ago, his dermatologist prescribed ZNP soap.  Since ZNP bar soap can no longer be purchased, Nobel Formula is a good replacement. He continues to use this soap and is pleased with the result.</li>
            <li> The soap is doing an amazing job to my skin (face).  I can see that my face looking cleaner and healthier.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> great product, very satisfied , will order some more in the future and will definitely recommend the soap to all my friends and family.&lt;br /&gt;a great replacement for ZNP bar soap</li>
            <li> The product arrived within the promised time frame.  I ordered the Noble 2% pyrithione zinc soap bar because Steiffel discontinued their ZNP soap bar.  The two products both contain 2% pyrithione zinc but are otherwise very different.  The Noble soap bar does not create much lather but it does seem to be helping my dry skin.  It has a gritty texture and I don&#x27;t know what ingredient it has that causes that.  I may try another product next time as I search for a ZNP bar replacement.</li>
            <li> This soap was recomended to my father by his doctor for some skin irritation he developed. Helped him get thru the shower without scratching up his skin due to that irritation. Purchased about 3 bars..and now my father is back to using his branded soaps such as Lever 2000.</li>
            <li> Been using it for a month, very happy with results. Seems to have stopped the flaking around my nose and brow. Very glad I found this product.</li>
            <li> My husband has had sensitive skin for many years. Most of the products he used to bath with would leave his face with a red rash which often turned scaly and raw looking.  Shampoos had the same effect on his scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We started using 2% Pyrithione Zinc Bar Soap about six months ago.  The 2% Pyrithione Zinc Bar Soap is gentle and yet effective. He bathes with it and also washes his head with it.  We keep a supply on hand always.  It&#x27;s worth every penny![[ASIN:B00606RORK 2% Pyrithione Zinc Bar Soap - Vegan Formula]]</li>
            <li> This item is not just a soap. It cannot be found in 99% of drugstores. The fact most do not know about seborrheic dermatitis, and or psoriasis can both be caused by one issue or a combination of symptoms. I personally have psoriasis. Seborrheic dermatitis appears to run in families. Stress, fatigue, weather extremes, oily skin, infrequent shampoos or skin cleaning, use of lotions that contain alcohol, skin disorders (such as acne), or obesity may increase the risk.&lt;br /&gt; So, if not knowing that and now learning it helps you to understand its not necessarily your fault. It comes down to how you attempt to treat it. Most of the market items \\&quot;designed to treat\\&quot; the issue actually make it worse. As you see certain lotions and so forth can actually make it worse if containing alcohol and others are so thick the skin cannot breath. You feel better due to it not feeling dry but in appearance it in fact looks worse due to it being well lubricated making it \\&quot;Glow\\&quot; red instead of a lighter red.&lt;br /&gt; The point I am attempting to make is that try hard to find what causes yours if at a lower level and you can overcome it. Mine personally is caused by the fact my face creates an excessive amount of lubricant for the skin. WHo knew right? Always thought moisturizing the skin is helpful. Problem is if the body slows down based on certain factors as in for me I have discovered is my Diet (eating bad foods) and not a high enough intake of water. Those are pretty much the basics of skin maintenance but, for those of us who are extra challenged its more important.&lt;br /&gt; THis product is fantastic. Reason being is that if you use regular soap pn your face it REALLY dries it out. This soap has the Pyrithione zinc which cleans and treats the skin at the same time. If used regularly you will definitely see the difference.Of course do not forget with anything the body develops its own counteraction to everything you give it if given too often so at first the instinct is to use it everyday.Once you see how it works, alternate Morning one day and then evening prior to bed the next day. Then skip the next day complately and start over the following morning. It keeps your skin on its toes...lol....&lt;br /&gt;GREAT PRODUCT THAT HELPS THOSE OF US THAT DEAL WITH , SUFFER, AND PERHAPS ARE EMBARASSED WHEN GOING OUT WITH THE RED SKIN CAUSED BY SEBORRHEIC DERMATITIS OR PSORIASIS. IT&#x27;S A SECRET WEAPON OF WHICH SOME DERMATOLOGISTS AREN&#x27;T EVEN AWARE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CHEERS AND GOOD LUCK!</li>
            <li> Nothing major. Not a big difference to any other soap.</li>
            <li> Works well since I haven&#x27;t had a re-occurrence of TVS all year.</li>
            <li> Still haven&#x27;t seen n e change been 2 weeks.. Feeling hopeless with it now..</li>
            <li> For a long time, since I was in middle school, I have had issues with my face. I&#x27;ve tried everything! But nothing seemed to work. It wasn&#x27;t until a couple of months ago that I got tired of dealing with the red, itchy, and peeling skin that I started to research hardcore into other products. I used cortisone cream for the most part, but it never worked in the long-term. It would always come back in about a week or so. I found out about your product from your website, or at least I think it was your website, so I decided to give it a try. For the last couple of months I have not had any redness, itchy, or flaking skin issues. Everyone complements my on how clear my complexion is now. I&#x27;m not embarrassed to go out and show my face anymore. I&#x27;m 30 years old now and for the first time in 15 years I can finally see my face. So, thank you for your great product, and I plan to keep purchasing from you in the future. Thank you again!</li>
            <li> I would like to add a little background about my skin condition before I get to the actual review of the product. I first started noticing flaky white skin on both sides of my nose in early 2011. I thought it was nothing and scratched it off. Lo and behold, it came back again, and again, and again. I started using lotions and creams, but nothing made me skin better. I ended up seeing a dermatologist and they prescribed me with ketoconazole gel to use. The gel was very successful and I didn&#x27;t have problems for quite a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During this summer the skin issues on my nose came back. I got ketoconazole again, but this time it did not do anything. The condition on my nose only got worse and it started to spread. Soon enough this infinite flaky white skin condition was on both sides of my nose, under my eyebrows, on my chin, and behind my ears. I did not have the time to go back to a dermatologist so I began doing internet research and saw a lot of people recommended Pyrithione Zinc. I had never heard of it, but looked it up on Amazon and found this soap. I purchased it on a whim(saw it had good reviews and had Amazon cash to spend) and have used it for a week each time I have showered in the morning. My skin looks awesome! There is a tiny bit of the white flakiness on one side of my nose left, but my chin, eyebrows, and behind are ears and smooth and normal again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with this product thus far and definitely recommend you give it a try if you have skin experiences like mine.</li>
            <li> This is the best on the market for skin conditions and eczema problems. Other products like ZNP contain blue color and alcohol (very drying to skin). If your doctor had prescribed ZNP in the past, this is a better replacement for it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this soap because I have a skin condition, blotches that are a bit scaley. I heard about it on Dr. Oz, so I gave it a try.  After using it for 3 weeks, i have not notices any change in the condition, so I can&#x27;t give it a good critique.</li>
            <li> Very good soap for tiniaversicolor. Kept the dryness and itching away. Would buy again.a little expensive, but worth the money. Need to sell in stores.</li>
            <li> This soap did not work as fast as I expected, based on some reviews I read through searching the web.  However, it does work, for me!  I&#x27;ve used the ZNP bar on and off before, many years ago, to treat seborrhea eczema.  It worked much faster than Noble Formula, however, I did experience burning and stinging from it.  I do not have those reactions when I use this soap.  Also, this soap is exfoliating and moisturizing, unlike the ZNP bar, so not only does it treat the itching and flaking, but it also doesn&#x27;t leave me dry.  (That is a plus!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, patience is a must when using this product, for you will not see instant results.  However, make sure to use it at least twice a day.  And, if you have time, rub the soap on the affected areas and let it sit for 3-5 minutes to give it time to do it&#x27;s &amp;#34;magic&amp;#34;.  &#x3D; )</li>
            <li> Best soap for my face</li>
            <li> I bought this for my stubborn tinea versicolor. Mine doesn&#x27;t look too extreme, but it is very, very stubborn. I usually take the Nizoral pill and do the sweat treatment to get rid of my tinea, but it comes back every summer. This year I wanted to give my liver a break from the nizoral since it&#x27;s very strong. I used this every day until it was completely gone and did not notice a change at all. Maybe for someone with a mild case of tinea versicolor, this would work, but it did not work for me.</li>
            <li> Have used this soap on and off for Seborrheic Dermatitis.  Didn&#x27;t work at the beginning but I thought I would give it a few more tries.  This thing just doesn&#x27;t help in anyway.  I will be throwing the remaining two bars away.</li>
            <li> I loved them both, they worked very well with my very dry skin.  The cream was not heavy and greasy, but did a great job!</li>
            <li> I have the dreaded Seborrhea condition with my facial skin.  Nightmare!  I find that this soap dries the heck out of it and have stopped using it.  It is winter and perhaps the heat in the house, cold out of doors etc. etc. is bumping up the volume on my skin condition, however it does not do what it promises to do.</li>
            <li> I have had Seborrhoeic dermatitis for 14 years. It started from my scalp and then moved to my hairline. During the last year, it appeared behind my ears, on my shoulders and now it starts to appear on my neck as well. So, I decided to try one more product and I bought the noble formula soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I love about this soap?&lt;br /&gt;That it is a scrub soap.&lt;br /&gt;That its smell is so light I don&#x27;t even notice the smell.&lt;br /&gt;That it leaves my skin clean and oil free every single time and for hours.&lt;br /&gt;That it has helped me with my dermatitis! In fact I use it at twice a day (morning and night) and the flakes on my hairline, scalp and ears starts to disappear (I don&#x27;t use it on my shoulders every day). I will keep using it in order to see if the redness will go away too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t love about this soap?&lt;br /&gt;That sometimes it makes my skin tingle for a few seconds (but nothing unbearable).&lt;br /&gt;That it&#x27;s slimy, which makes it look totally disgusting.&lt;br /&gt;That it shrinks quickly. I try to keep it away from water when I&#x27;m not using it, so it won&#x27;t soak, but it still shrinks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although it&#x27;s effective, I think I will try something else when it&#x27;s over.</li>
            <li> After only 2 days using this for my seborrheic dermatitis, my itching is almost non exisitent, the redness &amp; the flaking at the temples has lessened greatly.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m using it twice a day &amp; have had no reactions, which considering my SD is allergy triggered, is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;The hand milled bar...you can feel the quality. Its amazing. I love seeing no lather....it means no detergents.&lt;br /&gt;Truly an amazing product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about two weeks now, though not as religiously as I should, and it has vastly cleared up my seborrheic dermatitis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it has not removed the redness and flaking entirely, it has cleared up the effects by what I would say is about 75%. In my case, it was mild redness around the cheeks/nose, on the forehead, and chin with flaking. This is almost entirely gone after using this product, though some redness still persists. When combined with a exfoliating sponge, the results are fantastic. The soap itself has no fragrance and leaves an odd sort of film feeling on your skin after use if you don&#x27;t wash it off too vigorously, but I&#x27;ve had no other side effects. It seems to be helping my acne as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Real shame that it&#x27;s nearly impossible to find this product in a local drug store, at least in soap form. The only other place I&#x27;ve found 2% Pyrithione Zinc is in certain brands of Head and Shoulders shampoo products. I would recommend using those in the shower, even letting them sit on your affect skin, and use the Noble Formula soap bar for a twice-daily facial wash separate from your shower. That&#x27;s what seems to be working best for me.</li>
            <li> I am using retinal at night, this was recommended to me. I love it, does not strip the skin, has a mild exfoliation to it and leaves skin feeling so soft and ready for the day. I am ordering another bar for my daughter to use, as she has Atopic Dermatitis .....severely dry skin. What a find! No need to buy $100.00 cleansing creams and lotions!</li>
            <li> The soap has such large chunks, that it is more scratchy than exfoliating.  So far it works though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note, I don&#x27;t wish to be required to write more than a few words, as a vendor could you share that with Amazon?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ivy</li>
            <li> I have used this bar for years.  It is excellent for rosacea, for skin irritation, for dermatitis of all kinds including fungus, scalp dermatitis as well and even, believe it or not for dry skin.  But, I would suggest ordering this out of a hot season.  I re-ordered in a heat spell and it came melty.  But, think about the climate and order it.  Outstanding product.</li>
            <li> Anyone who may find relief from pyrithione zinc for the skin irritations, this product is for you. Even just for general use, it is a very nice soap that is fragrance free but leaves your skin nourished and clean.</li>
            <li> Was given as a gift and she still uses on her places where she breaks out. no response on how it worked.</li>
            <li> Previous product is no longer manufactured.  Just started using this zinc bar soap... no visible change can be attributed to the product as yet.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see much of a difference in my eczema after using this. Got very slimy aswell, I may have bought it in store again but not online</li>
            <li> my skin is irritated easily, though i don&#x27;t have psoriasis/eczema. this takes away a lot of facial redness. the one downside is it&#x27;s a little high in pH, try following with a toner.</li>
            <li> Excellent for eczema/rash prone skin. Does not dry your skin out at all and very moisturizing. Pleasant smell too, and last a very long time.</li>
            <li> I gave this product a try for my facial rosacea, and I have to say it is effective in controlling redness/blemishes. I especially like the way it rinses so clean from the skin. My only quibble with the soap is that the oatmeal protruding from the soap is very hard. I would never put this bar of soap to my face, and I grimace when I rub the soap between my hands because the oatmeal chunks hurt the palms of my hands so much. This would be a 5-star product if it weren&#x27;t for that darned oatmeal which I suppose must serve some kind of a constructive function.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this is a great product but it just didn&#x27;t work for me. Maybe I didn&#x27;t give it enough time but it just dried my skin out too much and made it feel really tight.</li>
            <li> I have suffered from dry skin ever since I can remember. However, I never had skin that was so sensitive that I couldn&#x27;t even use the most \\&quot;gentle\\&quot; cleansers on it. Three years ago I gave birth to my son, and my entire body chemistry changed, as I know that it certainly can after such hormonal changes. My skin became increasingly drier as the months passed. Over the past year I have lost 45 lbs by working out on a daily basis. This caused my face to become irritated and stingy after a workout. At the time I was using Aveeno calming foam cleaner, and it caused my face to dry and crack. I switched to Burt&#x27;s Bees sensitive skin cleanser in hopes that it would help relieve my skin. For a month or two it seemed to accomplish this task. However, after a few more months I noticed that my face had returned to being cracked and dry. Not only that, but the skin on my forehead looked greasy and red (with scales). I thought for sure that I had Seborrheic Dermatitis (and I still have an appointment with a derm to see what is going on next week), so I started to feel hopeless. I thought that I would be doomed to use steroids or anti-fungal creams for the rest of my life. My skin routine used to consist of a cleaner and moisturizer, so this was extremely devastating to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon searching, I found that zinc was listed as an ingredient for people with dry and irritated skin. I thought I would take a leap of faith and order t his soap. I got it yesterday and decided to try it this morning. Morning is when my skin looks best..until I shower and it becomes dry and flaky again. Well, after ONE wash my face was noticeably smoother and less red to the point where it looked completely normal (compared to the rest of my face). There were a few dry patches, but not anywhere NEAR as many as I had before. My face didn&#x27;t feel tight today, and I felt confident enough to leave my house. I had been depressed and starting to isolate myself from people for the past few weeks. I am going to give this product a few weeks to see what happens, but if this progress keeps up...I will be forever grateful to this company. I plan to order a few more bars!o give this product a few weeks to see what happens, but if this progress keeps up...I will be forever grateful to this company. I plan to order a few more bars!</li>
            <li> I got to hear this soap from dr oz for the very first time. I tried it and menn, it has never dissapointed me. Thank God I watched his show that day. This is my second purchase.</li>
            <li> Read all the pros and cons and things other users had to say  about this product. Decided I would see for myself and so far I am very satisfied with the results. Am hoping it continues. So for now I give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> have only used this a few times so far, but it seems to work well&lt;br /&gt;doesn&#x27;t irritate skin, and works well if you just wet a cotton pad and use small amounts at a time</li>
            <li> Great Product. that really works and for sure will buy again, Thanks and I will purchase again in the future.</li>
            <li> The soap works really good I use to have a lot of facial dry skin and using every day has pretty much cleared it all up...use to really show up when i shaved but all good now with the Noble Soap.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because my dermatologist recommended it to me. It&#x27;s good for eczema and other skin conditions, but I use it for acne purposes. My Dr told me that zinc was very good for my skin, and its been working very good along with other products. It&#x27;s much smaller than I thought but its worth a try. Good purchase overall!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe that after using perscription meds for so long, this works better than all of them!! thank you!!</li>
            <li> I bought this purely to treat the tinea versicolor I get on my upper arms and chest.  The oatmeal pieces do make for a ragged bar of soap, so I lather this up on a washcloth, apply it on as thick as I can, then leave it on for a minutes while I shave my legs.  I do this maybe 2-3 times a week, and it did clear up my tinea versicolor.  No, it will not work as quickly as prescription strength selenium sulfide, but it works much better than the low dose of selenium sulfide found in dandruff shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yeah, it&#x27;s an expensive bar of soap, but as I only use it only problem areas, it has lasted me for months.</li>
            <li> One use &amp; the summer itchy,dry skin felt so much better!  It makes you want to linger in the bath all covered in this soap. Since we&#x27;re all too busy to do that, it&#x27;s good to know the skin relief has continued on through the 1st 24 hrs. I learned about this soap on Dr. Cynthia Bailey&#x27;s blog &amp; am now a fan of both!</li>
            <li> Oatmeal soap has a tendency to be slimy and this is.  Does not foam up but it appears to work ok.  Still, I think I&#x27;ll find something else for my dermatitis after this bar is gone.</li>
            <li> Bought this product after seeing a dermatologist recommendation on Dr. Oz show. So far we both love this product and would buy it again.</li>
            <li> This product does not help with perioral dermatitis. I have been using it for 3 months and no improvement. The \\&quot;exfoliant\\&quot; is way too harsh for your skin, and I&#x27;ve used a facial loofah for years. If you wear eye make up you will need to remove it prior to washing your face. And beware, the soap will sting your eyes.</li>
            <li> Mild &amp; creamy, but I can&#x27;t say it improved my rosacea any, &amp; I prefer a more moisturizing cream wash.</li>
            <li> My eczema was on my face and I found this soap too strong to use there, it stung too much. I did not notice any improvement in the condition from the soap,but this could be partly because I could not use it more than a few times because of the stinging. The soap is also extremely soft and slimy and the bar started wanting to fall apart after only a few uses. Giving it 3 stars anyway because the smell was pleasant, it seemed moisturizing/ did not leave skin dry, and from the way it made my face burn I can tell it is medicated and can easily believe it could help someone with skin problems not on their face.</li>
            <li> Recommended for seborrheic dermatitis. Working great after only 3 weeks!</li>
            <li> I developed facial excema a few years a ago.  I tried everything, nothing worked.  I researched and found this stuff.  I use it twice a day and I&#x27;m clear.</li>
            <li> I have chronic S.D. and I did notice that it helped clear up some of my flare ups but it doesn&#x27;t really work that great. Sometimes I don&#x27;t notice a difference at all.</li>
            <li> I have had tinea versicolor for many years.  You really can&#x27;t get rid of it.  Under the right conditions of moist and oily skin, it starts growing again.  It won&#x27;t kill you, but it doesn&#x27;t look good when you are in swimming suit.  I have always used dermatologist prescription 2% selenium shampoo to treat it applied for about 10 minutes or so, and then showering it off.  I also use Selsun type shampoo regularly applied all over the body.  The generally works.  A friend said they have been using the zinc based soap with success, so I thought I would try it out.  I have purchased both this DemaZinc soap and Noble formula soap, and both seam to work well, but not quite as fast as the prescription selenium shampoo.  Both Soaps have a neutral scent, which is great for me.  I have dry skin, and both soaps, used as both shampoo and body bar, leave my skin moisturized.  I recommend this product, if you can&#x27;t get, or can&#x27;t afford the prescription drug.  Noble Formula is supposed to have other properties not found in regular zinc therapy soap, but I have no knowledge of those properties.</li>
            <li> Good for seborrheic dermatitis on face. Clearing up in about 2 weeks. Skin stops flaking and color evening out.</li>
            <li> Do not use this product on your face! The first time I used the soap, I thought it had a nice smell. I wanted the Zinc content for my skin and thought the vegan ingredients would be a nice natural exfoliant. There is too much oatmeal in this soap. By vegan, did they mean edible? After one or two uses the coarse oatmeal is as rough as a metal rasp. The rest of the soap base was very drying to my skin. I could not use my hands to lather up; it was painful. I could use a washcloth, but the oatmeal pieces were large and would break free, leaving me to either pick them out or scratch my skin with them. This product is not suitable for sensitive skin in any area of the body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Main points:&lt;br /&gt;1. The oatmeal is too large a grind size - there are rough chunks.&lt;br /&gt;2. The soap is drying, sapping essentials oils away.&lt;br /&gt;3. It is difficult to apply without avoiding those large chunks of oatmeal.&lt;br /&gt;4. No discernible benefit from the other ingredients.</li>
            <li> Soft soap which has healing effect for dry skin</li>
            <li> This is kinda gross to use, little bits of oats in the bar and they come off when you scrub.  Trust me, having little brown bits all over is disgusting.&lt;br /&gt;  Zinc bars are great for those of us with allergies, but hey you guys - a lot of&lt;br /&gt;us allergic folks are also allergic to oats and wheat and the other stuff you&lt;br /&gt;put in here.  How about a nice pure zinc bar without the allergens?&lt;br /&gt;Please?</li>
            <li> This soap does wonders for my seborrheic dermatitis.  My forehead and eyelids do not flake as much as they did before I started using this soap.  I use it with an exfoliating pad.  I am well pleased with this soap and will keep using it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is pretty awesome.  I&#x27;ve had tinea versacolor on and off for several years.  I use to use Selsun blue, but that smelled bad.  This stuff is great and I use it anytime I shower.  I know that may be overkill and it is a bit expensive, but it ensures that I have clear and healthy looking skin.</li>
            <li> Got this for itchy skin and while it seems to work it is so rough after a little use that it is a challenge</li>
            <li> I have tried expensive brand name lotion and did not work, untill my wife bought me this.&lt;br /&gt;I used to have really flaky skin on my face w/ this soap it took care of  that plus my dandruft.</li>
            <li> I had been using proactive for years and it made my skin so dry and didn&#x27;t really seem to help with my acne.   Either that or I was using so much lotion to keep it from drying out that the lotion was breaking me out.  This is awesome stuff.  It cleans my skin and does not dry it out.  Not to mention it&#x27;s literally 1/5 the cost and lasts forever....and is only one step of my routine versus three.  Time saving, effective, and affordable!</li>
            <li> I have been plagued with a seasonal allergy rash and itch on my elbow crease and forearms from July  til November for at least 10 yrs. I feel it is caused by a mold or spore that emerges in the warm weather, probably in the grass.  Having moved from northern New England to N. Carolina in June set my symptoms off in the worst way. I was so itchy that I didn&#x27;t want to go outside and was taking two oatmeal baths a day, to sooth my skin,  absolutely miserable.  My only other relief was applications Zeasorb Powder and washing with ZNP zinc Soap. The soap is now discontinued and  impossible to find .It was wonderful to locate a replacement remedy I needed on Amazon with their suggestions.  The Noble regimen of soap and cream have helped me immensely and I&#x27;m back to normal, enjoying the outdoors and am free off the dreaded itch! Thanks a million!</li>
            <li> Received  with no problem!</li>
            <li> I had a chronic back itch that plagued me for years and now I don&#x27;t thanks to Noble Formula. Thanks</li>
            <li> I purchased this soap because I couldn&#x27;t find ZNP anymore. I started using ZNP because my dermatologist recommended it for some acne he thought was caused by yeast overgrowth.  ZNP worked great.  Everyone recommended Noble Formula because it has Pyrithione Zinc like ZNP. It cleanses very well, but its not super moisturizing for my skin.  I have combination/dry skin, so after I wash it leaves my skin kinda squeaky feeling and a little tight. After I ran out of ZNP I actually tried to use another cleanser without Pyrithione Zinc, but my acne came back.  Now that I&#x27;ve been using Noble Formula for a few months it has definitely decreased the bumps.  Overall I like it and will probably buy a few more bars.</li>
            <li> Great product, but no longer produced by the manufacturer. I wish I had ordered more. Anyone know what works as a replacement product?</li>
            <li> Seems to be the best formula yet for this soap.  Gentle enough to calm down my flaky SD, but not so oily that I breakout.  Have been using about a week.  Hope it keeps working.</li>
            <li> 1. That soap is not similar to ZNP according to my experience.  2. I wondered why ZNP is not sold anymore. Then I found this article:  [...]  3. Now I am worried and I stopped to use that new soap.  It was irritating my skin anyhow.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item for a very hard to treat dermatitis on my face, my doctor had suggested that I use zinc pyrithione shampoo. I am using the soap daily. Although my condition has not improved, it has not gotten worse.  My face definitely feels smoother in the non-affected areas.</li>
            <li> Saw this product on Dr Oz show...it is definitely helping to break up &amp; eliminate tinea versicolor on my arms - would recommend to anyone needing help with skin problem.</li>
            <li> I think it works and I bought it because Dr. Oz recommended it for my rash type. I like using a soap now rather than body wash. Only negatives are its small for the price but I will buy again since it works and I no&lt;br /&gt;Longer have to use smelly medicated head and shoulders as my body wash. Also soap seems to melt down by water easy, gets mushy on outside when wet. Again I will buy another as it works and ther in Not an unpleasant smell. I would recommend.</li>
