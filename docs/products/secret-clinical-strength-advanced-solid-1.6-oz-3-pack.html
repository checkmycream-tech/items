            <li>I&#x27;m ordering more!</li>
            <li>It works great, goes on smooth and dry, and works perfectly.</li>
            <li>AND ONCE YOU UNWRAP TO USE, ROLL BOTTOM TO PUSH UP PRODUCT TO THE TOP OF TUBE TO USE THE TUBE</li>
            <li>LOVE the clinical strength deoderant.</li>
            <li>Amazon price is the most competitive I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>Works better than every type we have tried.  </li>
            <li>so even they guys in my family use it and love it.</li>
            <li>Great price, fast shipping...couldn&#x27;t ask for much more.</li>
            <li>WORKS WELL, BUT GOES VERY QUICKLY.</li>
            <li>Hands down the best deodorant that I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I love this sensitive formula the regular is to strong and makes me itch so this is perfect.  </li>

            <li>Just as described, shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>LUCKY FOR</li>
            <li>I never considered myself a particularly sweaty person, but I really enjoyed the difference when I tried this -</li>

            <li>so I bit the bullet and have been using this, even though it is pretty pricey.</li>
            <li>Long lasting and withstands a good workout.  </li>
            <li>Still hoping to find something that works as well for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>IF IT ISN&#x27;T REALLY NEEDED</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth the extra cost in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Despite being advertised as &amp;#34;for sensitive skin&amp;#34;, this produce stings my underarms.</li>
            <li>I am sensitive to deodorants and have been using Almay clear for years, but it seems like they changed the formula because it feels almost slimy.</li>
            <li>I got exactly what I expected and I like that it comes in a 3 pack.</li>
            <li>I love this deodorant, but it&#x27;s pretty expensive in big box stores and pharmacies.  </li>
            <li>ME I&#x27;M NOT VERY ACTIVE</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for those who have tried other deodorants made for sensitive skin only to find an itchy red rash appear after several days.</li>

            <li> Very expensive!  But it works great.  Still hoping to find something that works as well for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> The product ingredients are good, but the consistency is not.  You turn the dial to push the product thru holes &amp; apply it to skin.  I like the solid powder form much better.</li>
            <li> have used for years and is the only one that does not irritate or cause itching. If need be you can go 2 days without applying again.</li>
            <li> Best deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used. Long lasting and withstands a good workout.  Has a great scent to still give you a feminine feel.</li>
            <li> Just as described, shipped quickly. Perfect</li>

            <li> WORKS WELL, BUT GOES VERY QUICKLY. THE TUBE IS MUCH SMALLER THAN MOST AND ONCE YOU UNWRAP TO USE, ROLL BOTTOM TO PUSH UP PRODUCT TO THE TOP OF TUBE TO USE THE TUBE IS 3/4 OF THE WAY EMPTY. LUCKY FOR ME I&#x27;M NOT VERY ACTIVE AND JUST NEED CLINICAL ONE FOR MEDICAL REASONS, BUT IF I&#x27;D USE IT LIKE AN ACTIVE PERSON I CAN&#x27;T IMAGINE A TUBE LASTING MORE THAN A WEEK OR WEEK AND A HALF. BAD INGREDIENTS ARE USED SO IF IT ISN&#x27;T REALLY NEEDED I&#x27;D SUGGEST TRYING SOMETHING MORE NATURAL FIRST.</li>
            <li> This is as non-scented as you can find when it comes to deoderant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE the clinical strength deoderant. I never considered myself a particularly sweaty person, but I really enjoyed the difference when I tried this - it&#x27;s worth the extra cost in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Amazon price is the most competitive I&#x27;ve found.</li>

            <li> Works better than every type we have tried.  Unscented, so even they guys in my family use it and love it.</li>
            <li> This is the only deodorant that I&#x27;m not allergic to! Highly recommended for those who have tried other deodorants made for sensitive skin only to find an itchy red rash appear after several days.</li>
            <li> I was breaking out from everything. This product works and keeps you smelling fresh.</li>
            <li> I love this deodorant, but it&#x27;s pretty expensive in big box stores and pharmacies.  This is a great value!</li>
