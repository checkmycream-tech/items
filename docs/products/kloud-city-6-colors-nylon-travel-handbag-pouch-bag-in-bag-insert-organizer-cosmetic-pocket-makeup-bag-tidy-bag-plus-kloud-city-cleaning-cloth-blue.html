            <li>but it is perfect for me to put my make up when traveling.</li>
            <li>inside are bottomless pits, and this is perfect.</li>
            <li>great organization!</li>
            <li>Otherwise, very happy.</li>
            <li>It is a great size for storing all of their &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; make up and tweezers, etc.</li>
            <li>Everything else seems to work great.</li>
            <li>A great purse organizer.</li>
            <li>This is so handy!</li>
            <li>But, for me the best part is that I don&#x27;t have to dig, dig, and dig some more for my keys.</li>
            <li>It is probably good for the women who has a lot of make-up</li>
            <li>They are cute and help hold a lot of stuff!</li>
            <li>I love it for traveling as I can organize everything for the flight!</li>
            <li>Buy a better one!</li>
            <li>I love it so much I&#x27;ve purchased two more as gifts!!!</li>
            <li>Very good quality, and my bag is very organized.</li>
            <li>I am more organized than I was before.  </li>
            <li>you will be pleased and will be glad you did.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK, I sew</li>
            <li>I love that the outer pockets are see-through, so you can see what;s</li>
            <li>This fit in my bags nicely, expands to a roomy size but why does the inside have to be GRAY?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it will fit most bags.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great idea, and a nice size, but the handle pulled loose within 1 day of arrival.  </li>
            <li>The quality is very good, better than what I expected for the price.</li>
            <li>I know what to expect for cheap china products</li>
            <li>I thought this would fit my needs</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not as light gray as in the picture, it&#x27;s darker than that.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s smallest, but it also fit in</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t fit in every purse, somewhat large for most and don&#x27;t use it a lot.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, but very flimsy and doesn&#x27;t like to &amp;#34;stand</li>
            <li>I love my medium  sized or deep bags that are cute but</li>
            <li>I was looking forward to this organizer and the convenience of quickly changing my handbags.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed!</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think I can fit nearly as much as I thought.</li>
            <li>very handy- love it for a larger handbag- too large for smaller bag or clutch.</li>
            <li>Would be better if were a bit smaller.</li>
            <li>The first time I picked it up to change to another purse, one of the handles ripped off.  </li>
            <li>but i just really needed a organizer for my baby essentials for the diaper bag!</li>
            <li>Grey is better</li>
            <li>This is a light blue and it is easier to see what you have.</li>
            <li>These were very affordable.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t really portable in the way pictured.</li>
            <li>I do like the light color, makes things easier to find in my big bags.</li>
            <li>but I plan to just take them off because they arent really neccessary.</li>
            <li>I bought mine in light blue.</li>
            <li>Seem most purses have black linings-</li>
            <li>Cheap seams threads as expected so reinforced the handles myself.</li>
            <li>but when I put it in my purse, it wasn&#x27;t as easy as anticipated to get things from the external pockets and the middle pocket is on the small side.  </li>

            <li> The blue one is not same quality as grey!</li>
            <li> Additionally, the pockets are way to small to hold much of anything.  </li>
            <li> Traveling bag would be difficult since the outer pockets have no zippers or way to secure the items inside.</li>

            <li> Different storage areas instead of a mess in one make up bag.</li>
            <li> I thought it was going to be a little bigger with a handle</li>
            <li> /&gt;This could also be used for cosmetics or even small craft items, such as sewing or quilting supplies.</li>
            <li> To give you an idea, this fitted my small Coach cross body bag in</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, stop rooting around in that dark bag and get one of these-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not new to purse inserts but the thing about them, they are almost always in black, which defeats the purpose of finding anything small in your purse.</li>
            <li> All seams are tight and edged, and the zippers are sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sturdy little bag.</li>
            <li> Having a lighter colored purse insert banishes the black hole effect!</li>
            <li> no more</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> why, I ask you???- which makes it hard to see anything.</li>
            <li> It is hard to store anything in the side pockets.</li>
            <li> If I lay them on the bottom, they are hard to retrieve, also ink blots accumulate there.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it, but not loving it.</li>

            <li> I ordered this to use so I wouldn&#x27;t have to carry my purse and laptop bag anymore, and I am more organized than I was before.  Definitely convenient for people on the go.</li>
            <li> LOVEEEE THIS!! I haven&#x27;t used it but it is perfect for me to put my make up when traveling. Different storage areas instead of a mess in one make up bag.</li>
            <li> This is so handy! I love my medium  sized or deep bags that are cute but inside are bottomless pits, and this is perfect. I can organize everything- there&#x27;s plenty of room and pockets- and slip it into whichever purse I need. There are tons of zipped or open pockets- I&#x27;ve yet to carry enough to fill them all. Seem most purses have black linings- why, I ask you???- which makes it hard to see anything. This is a light blue and it is easier to see what you have. But, for me the best part is that I don&#x27;t have to dig, dig, and dig some more for my keys. I have several rings and put them in one zippered side- no more searching!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This could also be used for cosmetics or even small craft items, such as sewing or quilting supplies. The quality is very good, better than what I expected for the price. All seams are tight and edged, and the zippers are sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, stop rooting around in that dark bag and get one of these- you will be pleased and will be glad you did.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use as a makeup bag.  I love it so much I&#x27;ve purchased two more as gifts!!!</li>
            <li> This is a lot smaller than I expected. It&#x27;s alright quality and it will get the job done.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t fit in every purse, somewhat large for most and don&#x27;t use it a lot. Would be better if were a bit smaller.</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to this organizer and the convenience of quickly changing my handbags.  The first time I picked it up to change to another purse, one of the handles ripped off.  Additionally, the pockets are way to small to hold much of anything.  I will use it for awhile, but it&#x27;s going into the &amp;#34;donate&amp;#34; basket.</li>
            <li> Cheap seams threads as expected so reinforced the handles myself. I know what to expect for cheap china products but i just really needed a organizer for my baby essentials for the diaper bag! The blue one is not same quality as grey! Grey is better</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like.  I thought this would fit my needs but when I put it in my purse, it wasn&#x27;t as easy as anticipated to get things from the external pockets and the middle pocket is on the small side.  I think this product would make sense if the middle pocket were wider and external pockets were on the inside.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my teen daughters. It is a great size for storing all of their &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; make up and tweezers, etc. These were very affordable. They are cute and help hold a lot of stuff!</li>
            <li> Sturdy little bag. I thought it was going to be a little bigger with a handle that you could actually hold the bag with, instead it fits off 2 fingers. It isn&#x27;t really portable in the way pictured. I was filling this will girly bath stuff for my niece  along with some makeup but I don&#x27;t think I can fit nearly as much as I thought.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great idea, and a nice size, but the handle pulled loose within 1 day of arrival.  It&#x27;s OK, I sew so I repairs, it&#x27;s just a hassle to send things back.  I do like the light color, makes things easier to find in my big bags.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it, but not loving it. It is hard to store anything in the side pockets. It is an improvement over total chaos.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for. I just wanted a cheaper organizer for my purse. This does the job. The pull tabs on the zippers were already frayed when I got it but I plan to just take them off because they arent really neccessary. Everything else seems to work great. I love it for traveling as I can organize everything for the flight!</li>
            <li> very handy- love it for a larger handbag- too large for smaller bag or clutch. great organization!</li>
            <li> A great purse organizer. I love that the outer pockets are see-through, so you can see what;s in there! My only suggestion for improvement would be to add sections for pens/pencils. If I lay them on the bottom, they are hard to retrieve, also ink blots accumulate there. Otherwise, very happy.</li>
            <li> I had this in my prurse for 3 days. Its already ripping. Buy a better one! don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> This bag look completely different than the photo. It is probably good for the women who has a lot of make-up but I don&#x27;t. Traveling bag would be difficult since the outer pockets have no zippers or way to secure the items inside.</li>
            <li> Goodbye purse jungle. Exactly what I needed!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, but very flimsy and doesn&#x27;t like to &amp;#34;stand up&amp;#34; in my bag... I&#x27;m constantly having to rearrange items to make it go back into the shape it should be in.  Basically you get what you pay for... for well under $10 I guess it serves its purpose.</li>
            <li> Very good quality, and my bag is very organized.</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this product.I&#x27;m not new to purse inserts but the thing about them, they are almost always in black, which defeats the purpose of finding anything small in your purse.This fit in my bags nicely, expands to a roomy size but why does the inside have to be GRAY? it&#x27;s not as light gray as in the picture, it&#x27;s darker than that.To give you an idea, this fitted my small Coach cross body bag in it&#x27;s smallest, but it also fit in my LV Berkeley expanded.I&#x27;m sure it will fit most bags.I just wished they&#x27;d change the color of the inside into the same color as the body-I bought mine in light blue.Having a lighter colored purse insert banishes the black hole effect!</li>
