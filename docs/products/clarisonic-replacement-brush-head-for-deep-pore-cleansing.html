            <li>Always pleased with my purchases</li>
            <li>I love the clairsonic.</li>
            <li>The deep pore replacement brush is made to attach to the clarisonic perfectly.</li>
            <li>so this is the one for more.</li>
            <li>I purchased the replacement brushes for deep pore cleansing and it works wonderfully.  </li>
            <li>Since amazon always has better deals, I bought it from here</li>
            <li>Most people say they don&#x27;t see my pores to begin with</li>
            <li>Trust me, it&#x27;s happened too many times</li>
            <li>I bought the deep pore cleansing brushes when I had break-outs and I am very happy with my complexion now.  </li>
            <li>have used Clarisonic products for many years &amp; have never had this issue before.</li>
            <li>Cheeper than department stores, love my Clarsonic Brush, by the way invest in the Opal as well.</li>
            <li>I really love this product.</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>Great and gentle exfoliation and cleaning.</li>
            <li>I wish it was more of a scrubber.</li>
            <li>but after many months (maybe even a year)</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am glad that I ordered.</li>
            <li>I love my Clarisonic and this brush is just what my skin ordered.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll will just continue buying them at ULTA from now on to be safe.</li>
            <li>and I love this brush better than I like the acne brush because it cleans my pores a lot better than the acne head did.  </li>
            <li>Way better than the Sensitve brush.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; brush that came with the unit massaged nicely but didn&#x27;t clean or exfoliate all that well.</li>
            <li>Replaced old brush head quickly and perfectly.  </li>
            <li>I like to keep my face very clean.</li>
            <li>Good quality, appears to be  Clarisonic, not fake.  </li>
            <li>huge change in my pore size after using this, i love the clairsonic, i feel like my skins</li>
            <li>I know a lot of people have said that this product is not the real replacement brush, however I bought mine from optimum outlet and very pleased to say that it is the REAL clarisonic brush :)</li>
            <li>Received it  when expected, and it works perfectly with my clarisonic.</li>
            <li>If you own a Clarisonic, you need no convincing on how awesome they are for your skin.  </li>
            <li>The competitors brush heads do not have nearly as many bristles as the original Clarisonic does.  </li>
            <li>Other than that it works great didn&#x27;t have any problems attaching it!</li>
            <li>These don&#x27;t stay in their discrete tufts, and bend much to easily when in contact with anything.  </li>
            <li>If you like a strong brush head than this is it.  </li>
            <li>; brushes are too strong for me, so I use the &amp;#34;Delicate&amp;#34; brush heads instead.  </li>
            <li>My skin is oily and does not naturally exfoliate at a rate I would like so cleaning my face with this brush head is ideal.  </li>
            <li>This is a fine product though.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be a repeat costumer, I am very pleased with this transaction!</li>
            <li>It made my skins really smooth</li>
            <li>(but it&#x27;s listed as genuine Clarisonic).</li>
            <li>But no these are sold as genuine Clarisonic heads and they are not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t always have time for facials but the results I got from one use mimics a great facial.  </li>
            <li>I understand they are cheap</li>
            <li>The bristles are rougher , the result being my face feels chapped instead of smooth.</li>
            <li>Didnt fit my clarisonic</li>
            <li>Great bargain makes getting  an extra brush affordable.</li>
            <li>My skin is always smooth.</li>
            <li>(I use Bliss fabulous)</li>
            <li>My skin feels so smooth after use.</li>
            <li>Clarisonic Replacement brush head fit my Mia 2 correctly.</li>
            <li>Deep Pore brush is a great brush to use for my skin</li>
            <li>It actually looks great.</li>
            <li>They both give my skin a phenomenal deep cleanse and feel really good while doing so.</li>
            <li>This was a great price, much lower than retail, it was a quick ship, and the product is exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>I used the head for normal skin, vut decided to try this one, and I&#x27;m glad I did!</li>
            <li>The brush was exactly as pictured, fit my Clarisonic well and seemed authentic.</li>
            <li>the new brush reminds me of how good the product is when first received!</li>
            <li>I had been warned that the product wouldn&#x27;t be an original from another review?</li>
            <li>mine came wrapped in the original box..</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pretty sure the brushes are counterfeit as well because after a week, they carried this stench that never happened before when I bought the brushes off Clarisonic.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I choose this type,hope it can make my skin more cleaner,It is good,I will use it</li>
            <li>Not disappointed.</li>
            <li>Came in the original box.</li>
            <li>I had another replacement head that doesn&#x27;t quite fit right, but this one clicked in easily when I checked it</li>
            <li>They are more popular right now than even the sensitive head.</li>
            <li>They are still hard to find in stores, so my advice is to order online; the sooner to enjoy this wonderful brush!</li>
            <li>I have found that they all clean the skin and exfoliate a bit.  </li>
            <li>My pores have never looked so clean and refined.</li>
            <li>I recently added the Clarisonic skin cleaning system to my skin care regimine as it was recommended to me as the safest and most effective cleansing system&lt;br /&gt;for</li>
            <li>This product leaves my face feeling refreshed and clean.</li>
            <li>my face always feels clean when i use this.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling clean.  </li>
            <li>I use it to clean/prepare my skin for Retin-A which seems to work far better!</li>
            <li>I bought this as a replacement for my  clarisonic mia, it fits perfectly but having bought a genuine replacement brush from clarisonic and comparing them both obvious that it isn&#x27;t genuine, the bristles on the brushes felt completely different.</li>
            <li>After going back and forth for awhile, I decided to e-mail the seller (in my case, Optimum Outlet) and asked whether this replacement brush came in an original Clairsonic Manufacture&#x27;s package and they said it did.</li>
            <li>I like my other brush head better, however, Im using this and felt it was a good value.</li>
            <li>The fibers are softer but more plush and I get a much deeper clean from this head.</li>
            <li>This brush head really does work better at getting hard-to-reach areas clean.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used it yet, but it came in quickly, and I&#x27;m excited to try it out.</li>
            <li>some people cant tell the difference between the true Clarisonic brushes</li>
            <li>If these had been sold as \\&quot;Replacement\\&quot; or some other wording, great.</li>
            <li>Bristles were super frayed upon receiving.</li>
            <li>Same as Macy&#x27;s but cheaper, pleased with product I love amazon and the savings they provide.</li>
            <li>Love my Clarisonic and am so glad they came out with different brushes.</li>
            <li>I therefore never actually used this brush so can&#x27;t say if it was as effective as genuine one</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very gentle and you really do feel like your skin is so clean; better than using your fingers...</li>
            <li>I am usually not a strict follower of change the head every 3 months but with this there is a huge difference!</li>
            <li>This is a genuine, brand new clarisonic head securely wrapped and sealed?  </li>
            <li>What a difference a new brush head makes; the old one seemed still good</li>
            <li>In fact this is the same counterfeit head that a popular online auction service seller sent me as well</li>
            <li>Clarisonic is the best kept skin secret.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>I am able to use the brush twice a day without my skin being too sensitive.</li>
            <li>I feel the Deep Pore Cleasing brush is softer and more comfortable.  </li>
            <li>and I find that I am getting far better cleaning and exfoliation without any harshness or irritation.</li>
            <li>Worth it.</li>
            <li>I was hoping this would get deep into the pores but its nothing spectacular.</li>
            <li>This brush is my favorite for my original Clarisonic because I have larger pores.</li>
            <li>had some misgivings about ordering after reading other reviews, but my experience was good.</li>
            <li>Just right.</li>
            <li>It felt like I had to use a whole box of those things to actually clean my nose pores.  </li>
            <li>You only need a drop of facial cleanser and it lathers beautifully.</li>
            <li>I purchased a Clairsonic that came with a gentle head, and wanted a deeper clean.  </li>
            <li>So glad they came out with different brush heads for deep pore cleansings, my skin feels amazing after every use.</li>
            <li>I usually buy at Sephora but while shopping here I came across this great price.</li>
            <li>Great product never had anymore skincare related blemishes only stress which this still aided in with my pro.</li>
            <li>I like this brush head very much over the others.  </li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m buying a deep clean brush head and the bristles are softer than they should be and it does&#x27;t even fit correctly.</li>
            <li>It is gentle and clean my face very well.</li>
            <li>my fines lines desapiered never look better and younger.</li>
            <li>Overall I love Clarisonic and recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>I use the deep pore head 2 or 3 times a week :)</li>
            <li>Really affordable and works as advertised!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Clarisonic for about 6 months then just got the deep pore brush and about a monthago and that helped even more.</li>
            <li>It cleans my skin but feels as if it doesn&#x27;t do a great of a job as the regular grey head does.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I will most definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted and arrived in a timely manner</li>
            <li>When I received mine in the mail, I opened it and immediately grabbed my authentic deep pore brush and box(purchased from L&#x27;Oreal company store)and</li>
            <li>authentic has a number on the back, I have #4</li>
            <li>Better pricing for same product if purchased from dermotologist office.  </li>
            <li>I like this brush better than the regular one.</li>
            <li>the real deal!</li>
            <li>This was the first replacement brush I purchased after I received a [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>The blue ring of bristles are stiffer and they do a better job of cleaning and whisking away stuff</li>
            <li>and this is the site to check out first.  </li>
            <li>First, your product will not come in a package.</li>
            <li>I have been using the  Clarisonic brush since they first came out.</li>
            <li>While it is a little softer than I expected ,it worked great!</li>
            <li>I got it yesterday and used last night, compared the one that came with the original machine, this one seems a little smaller, it still fits perfectly.</li>
            <li>My pores are so clear and clean after using this.</li>
            <li>This brand is just as good as the originals which are much more expensive.</li>
            <li>Obviously I love this product - helped clear my skin up completely</li>
            <li>I love the soft touch feel so far.</li>
            <li>I live in AZ and have dry skin, which needs a lot of exfoliating to allow the lotion to work effectively.</li>
            <li>If you have large pores this is the brush for you.</li>
            <li>I like deep exfoliation and exfoliate often because I am very oily and easily clog up.</li>
            <li>however, this is the first time that I have used this particular brush.</li>
            <li>I should&#x27;ve listened to the bad reviews, but there were so many positive 4 &amp; 5 star reviews that I thought the purchase would be a great one.</li>
            <li>Some of the sellers already state that they are generic and fit the Mia, never claiming them to be real.</li>
            <li>I tried replacement brush heads from a competitor and could tell a huge difference in my skin after only a week.  </li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t really suffer any breakouts or dryness from it.  </li>
            <li>But it still didn&#x27;t really do much about the pores on my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I notice much difference from the acne head</li>
            <li>/&gt;Secondly, a real Clarisonic brush head has compact, quality bristles.</li>
            <li>A GENUINE CLARISONIC DEEP PORE BRUSH HEAD:</li>
            <li>Really works around the crevices of my nose.</li>
            <li>So I really like it</li>
            <li>Using this brush with a cleanser every day instantly exfoliates your skin, leaving smooth, youthful looking skin.</li>
            <li>havnt really seen the difference with my clarisonic and this brush head.  </li>
            <li>I normally have very congested pores and have to say I have about an 80% improvement in my skin clarity!</li>
            <li>These are the real deal.</li>
            <li>Works but really 25$?</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast too.</li>
            <li>If you want the real thing...</li>
            <li>Much harsher on the face than the acne brush.</li>
            <li>Works very well, comes with a protective cover for the brush</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone who wants a clear/clean face.</li>
            <li>thanks indeed.</li>
            <li>It really helps keep blackheads away and scrub without stripping skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s almost time to get another one I use it so much.  </li>
            <li>thanks.</li>
            <li>These replacement brush heads are the real thing.</li>
            <li>I requested a return, which was approved, but even though the product is defective I am responsible for the return shipment.</li>
            <li>The Seller (not Amazon) shipped fast and package well.</li>
            <li>and it felt much softer.</li>
            <li>Most definitely not for those with sensitive skin though.</li>
            <li>I have oily skin with large pores and keeping it clean is really essential.    </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know about \\&quot;deep pore\\&quot; but it does clean and gently exfoliate the surface of my face.</li>
            <li>This brush head is much better than all of the other ones by Clarisonic.  </li>
            <li>This one cleans much more thoroughly than the other brushes.</li>
            <li>This brush head works well and it does deep clean my face an pores.  </li>
            <li>so maybe it&#x27;ll work for people who do have larger and more apparent pores.  </li>
            <li>So average product just a good brushhead with smaller brissels.</li>
            <li>I have less breakouts and my makeup ALWAYS looks better going on exfoliated skin.</li>
            <li>have large pores on my nose, middle forehead and right under my eyes.  </li>
            <li>plastic on the back is glossy beige/ivory where the authentic one is white and not as glossy(matte).&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I hesitated a long time before buying the brush: hey, couldn&#x27;t  I clean my face just as well?</li>
            <li>I have had the clarisonic set for a few years, this brush replacement came super quick and I noticied a difference in my skin in just 2 nights of use.</li>
            <li>; normal brush&amp;#34;...</li>
            <li>there&#x27;s a reason these are sold out left and right.</li>
            <li>I am a senior and I look much younger than my years-- no surgery, just the right equipment and brushes, called &#x27;Clarisonic&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>see below for details:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ink and images on box are faded (not as bold as authentic).&lt;br /&gt;The box is supposed to be grey but</li>
            <li>Great price for me to send it back the very next day as well - Does not fit the brush head properly so you don&#x27;t get a deep clean.</li>
            <li>This brush head is okay, but a little too soft for my preference.  </li>
            <li>the brush head doesn&#x27;t look new.</li>
            <li>They sellers contacted me and gave me a New York area code.</li>
            <li>I have no proof that the brush was used, but it didn&#x27;t quite look brand new either.</li>
            <li>My gamble didn&#x27;t net me a genuine Clarisonic Deep Pore Brush Head from FASTVIBES.</li>
            <li>While I have absolutely no problem with the clarisonic deep pore brush (only one that works amazingly on my face) do NOT purchase from the seller, fastvibes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried normal, sensitive and these.</li>
            <li>have bought from retail stores at  a much higher price and now this is the only way to go</li>
            <li>/&gt;Only cost be £5 pound to get genuine one, not worth the risk.</li>
            <li>Easy to use,great little timer to help.</li>
            <li>I bought this type of head because I have oily skin and clogged pores, it was a little scratchy at first, but the brush is now just right for my skin type.  </li>
            <li>The deep pore cleansing brush is just as gentle as the normal and sensitive brush.  </li>
            <li>comes in the real package brand new and was only $9!!!!</li>
            <li>Ordered the single Deep Pore Cleansing brush -- received genuine Clairsonic product.</li>
            <li>just got in the mail today and was extremely fast shipping too wasnt expecting it until next week!</li>
            <li>The Deep Pore Cleansing Brush Head really works.</li>
            <li>The genuine Clarisonic Deep Pore head has a deep blue ring.</li>
            <li>I am 45 years old  </li>
            <li>Its soft</li>
            <li>the brush is too soft</li>
            <li>Bristles are extremely soft for &amp;#34;Deep Pore&amp;#34; cleansing, these are not as dense as the ones you&#x27;d find at sephora or the like.</li>
            <li>I have to buy sensitive</li>
            <li>and I used it for a deep cleaning after an intense workout.  </li>
            <li>My skin is so soft after.</li>
            <li>I used the regular brush head for several weeks and saw an improvement in my skin, but the deep pore one definitely works better around the nose.</li>
            <li>It is definitely &#x27;rougher&#x27; than the gentle and acne-prone heads, but still doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  </li>
            <li>I had the sensitive skin one and switched to this head.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Mine was definitely the real deal in a Clarisonic box with product info.  </li>
            <li>So I did read some comments to stay away if you have somewhat sensitive skin, but I thought I could handle it.</li>
            <li>I was told at a store that the deep pore and sensitive heads are the same softness, but the deep pore has a longer bristle length to reach more deeply.</li>
            <li>Make sure to note that you will break out for a few days after using this brush because it is removing any deep build up.</li>
            <li>It works even better on my skin and no more microderms!</li>
            <li>Be sure only to use every other day or your skin will be stripped and start to get red and irritated.</li>
            <li>I purchased the mia as I want something small that I can easily pack when travelling.    </li>
            <li>Fits and looks clean but fluffy used looking bristles.</li>
            <li>With that being said, it probably will clean the pores, but left my face really red and dry.</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft, not rough at all.</li>
            <li>i got the normal and deep pore</li>
            <li>I think I prefer the sensitive brush more but at least this fits the handle properly so it works.</li>
            <li>These brushes I bought are softer and not like the normal feel of the deep pore cleaning brush heads.</li>
            <li>it is more like a brownish/grey (authentic is grey).&lt;br /&gt;The actual brush head (deep pore) has blue bristles but the blue on the fake is brighter then</li>
            <li>Coincidentally, majority of the sellers with low prices are shipping from New York.</li>
            <li>the same ones from clarisonic but so much cheaper and arrived in only a couple of days!</li>
            <li>Now that I have switched back to Clarisonic brush heads my skin is not only cleaner, but much brighter.</li>
            <li>this is NOT a fake as some other reviews may have stated.</li>
            <li>The six  \\&quot;rays\\&quot; on the white plastic rim are slightly smaller on the counterfeit, and the white outer ring of bristles is much too soft.  </li>
            <li>I work in plastic surgery and have been using high end facial products for over ten years to improve the health of my skin.</li>
            <li>I was having trouble with acne for the first time ever at the age of 33 and tried every product/medicine to help clear it up.</li>
            <li>People always ask me what I do to have such a clear, and youthful complexion.  </li>
            <li>I went back to my sensitive skin brush and skin is relaxed again.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely buy a sensitive skin brush from this seller.</li>
            <li>it may be used - scuff markings, frayed edges are apparent.</li>
            <li>I bought it with the sensitive skin brush, but about once a week or so, I use the deep pore head.  </li>
            <li>I never really did anything special for my face when showering other than wash with body wash or bar soap.  </li>
            <li>It only dawned on me to come to Amazon to order this because I could not get Clarisonic Deep Pore heads at any of my local stores (they were sold out) and my normal online sources were also sold out.</li>
            <li>decided to try this Deep Pore Head after the standard one got old and it is a noticeable improvement.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are arranged different and are somewhat coarser than my regular and sensitive brush heads.</li>
            <li>you get the head, the first thing to tip you off that it&#x27;s not genuine, is the color.</li>
            <li>Feels like an exfoliant so would make your skin sensitive and raw if you use it too much....</li>
            <li>This brush head arrived brand new and as expected.  </li>
            <li>I have noticed that my nose pores look less noticeable and don&#x27;t appear to be clogged like they used to be (as much).  </li>
            <li>B001EJOPWU Buf-Puf Reusable All-Purpose Facial Sponge, Gentle]] could dispatch a black head</li>
            <li>have makeup on for 15-20 hours sometimes- very long days, and this is the only product that i feel like i actually get the old make up and gunk</li>

            <li> I contacted amazon and as always, they were able to help.</li>
            <li> The deep pore brush is the perfect supplement to my skin care products!</li>
            <li> This is an authentic Clarisonic replacement brush head.  </li>
            <li> Always pleased with my purchases</li>
            <li> I love the clairsonic.</li>
            <li> The deep pore replacement brush is made to attach to the clarisonic perfectly.</li>
            <li> so this is the one for more.</li>
            <li> I purchased the replacement brushes for deep pore cleansing and it works wonderfully.  </li>
            <li> Since amazon always has better deals, I bought it from here</li>
            <li> Most people say they don&#x27;t see my pores to begin with</li>
            <li> Trust me, it&#x27;s happened too many times</li>
            <li> I bought the deep pore cleansing brushes when I had break-outs and I am very happy with my complexion now.  </li>
            <li> have used Clarisonic products for many years &amp; have never had this issue before.</li>
            <li> Cheeper than department stores, love my Clarsonic Brush, by the way invest in the Opal as well.</li>
            <li> I really love this product.</li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> Great and gentle exfoliation and cleaning.</li>
            <li> I wish it was more of a scrubber.</li>
            <li> but after many months (maybe even a year)</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am glad that I ordered.</li>
            <li> I love my Clarisonic and this brush is just what my skin ordered.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll will just continue buying them at ULTA from now on to be safe.</li>
            <li> and I love this brush better than I like the acne brush because it cleans my pores a lot better than the acne head did.  </li>
            <li> Way better than the Sensitve brush.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; brush that came with the unit massaged nicely but didn&#x27;t clean or exfoliate all that well.</li>
            <li> Replaced old brush head quickly and perfectly.  </li>
            <li> I like to keep my face very clean.</li>
            <li> Good quality, appears to be  Clarisonic, not fake.  </li>
            <li> huge change in my pore size after using this, i love the clairsonic, i feel like my skins</li>
            <li> I know a lot of people have said that this product is not the real replacement brush, however I bought mine from optimum outlet and very pleased to say that it is the REAL clarisonic brush :)</li>
            <li> Received it  when expected, and it works perfectly with my clarisonic.</li>
            <li> If you own a Clarisonic, you need no convincing on how awesome they are for your skin.  </li>
            <li> The competitors brush heads do not have nearly as many bristles as the original Clarisonic does.  </li>
            <li> Other than that it works great didn&#x27;t have any problems attaching it!</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t stay in their discrete tufts, and bend much to easily when in contact with anything.  </li>
            <li> If you like a strong brush head than this is it.  </li>
            <li> ; brushes are too strong for me, so I use the &amp;#34;Delicate&amp;#34; brush heads instead.  </li>
            <li> My skin is oily and does not naturally exfoliate at a rate I would like so cleaning my face with this brush head is ideal.  </li>
            <li> This is a fine product though.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be a repeat costumer, I am very pleased with this transaction!</li>
            <li> It made my skins really smooth</li>
            <li> (but it&#x27;s listed as genuine Clarisonic).</li>
            <li> But no these are sold as genuine Clarisonic heads and they are not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t always have time for facials but the results I got from one use mimics a great facial.  </li>
            <li> I understand they are cheap</li>
            <li> The bristles are rougher , the result being my face feels chapped instead of smooth.</li>
            <li> Didnt fit my clarisonic</li>
            <li> Great bargain makes getting  an extra brush affordable.</li>
            <li> My skin is always smooth.</li>
            <li> (I use Bliss fabulous)</li>
            <li> My skin feels so smooth after use.</li>
            <li> Clarisonic Replacement brush head fit my Mia 2 correctly.</li>
            <li> Deep Pore brush is a great brush to use for my skin</li>
            <li> It actually looks great.</li>
            <li> They both give my skin a phenomenal deep cleanse and feel really good while doing so.</li>
            <li> This was a great price, much lower than retail, it was a quick ship, and the product is exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> I used the head for normal skin, vut decided to try this one, and I&#x27;m glad I did!</li>
            <li> The brush was exactly as pictured, fit my Clarisonic well and seemed authentic.</li>
            <li> the new brush reminds me of how good the product is when first received!</li>
            <li> I had been warned that the product wouldn&#x27;t be an original from another review?</li>
            <li> mine came wrapped in the original box..</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m pretty sure the brushes are counterfeit as well because after a week, they carried this stench that never happened before when I bought the brushes off Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I choose this type,hope it can make my skin more cleaner,It is good,I will use it</li>
            <li> Not disappointed.</li>
            <li> Came in the original box.</li>
            <li> I had another replacement head that doesn&#x27;t quite fit right, but this one clicked in easily when I checked it</li>
            <li> They are more popular right now than even the sensitive head.</li>
            <li> They are still hard to find in stores, so my advice is to order online; the sooner to enjoy this wonderful brush!</li>
            <li> I have found that they all clean the skin and exfoliate a bit.  </li>
            <li> My pores have never looked so clean and refined.</li>
            <li> I recently added the Clarisonic skin cleaning system to my skin care regimine as it was recommended to me as the safest and most effective cleansing system&lt;br /&gt;for</li>
            <li> This product leaves my face feeling refreshed and clean.</li>
            <li> my face always feels clean when i use this.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling clean.  </li>
            <li> I use it to clean/prepare my skin for Retin-A which seems to work far better!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a replacement for my  clarisonic mia, it fits perfectly but having bought a genuine replacement brush from clarisonic and comparing them both obvious that it isn&#x27;t genuine, the bristles on the brushes felt completely different.</li>
            <li> After going back and forth for awhile, I decided to e-mail the seller (in my case, Optimum Outlet) and asked whether this replacement brush came in an original Clairsonic Manufacture&#x27;s package and they said it did.</li>
            <li> I like my other brush head better, however, Im using this and felt it was a good value.</li>
            <li> The fibers are softer but more plush and I get a much deeper clean from this head.</li>
            <li> This brush head really does work better at getting hard-to-reach areas clean.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it yet, but it came in quickly, and I&#x27;m excited to try it out.</li>
            <li> some people cant tell the difference between the true Clarisonic brushes</li>
            <li> If these had been sold as \\&quot;Replacement\\&quot; or some other wording, great.</li>
            <li> Bristles were super frayed upon receiving.</li>
            <li> Same as Macy&#x27;s but cheaper, pleased with product I love amazon and the savings they provide.</li>
            <li> Love my Clarisonic and am so glad they came out with different brushes.</li>
            <li> I therefore never actually used this brush so can&#x27;t say if it was as effective as genuine one</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very gentle and you really do feel like your skin is so clean; better than using your fingers...</li>
            <li> I am usually not a strict follower of change the head every 3 months but with this there is a huge difference!</li>
            <li> This is a genuine, brand new clarisonic head securely wrapped and sealed?  </li>
            <li> What a difference a new brush head makes; the old one seemed still good</li>
            <li> In fact this is the same counterfeit head that a popular online auction service seller sent me as well</li>
            <li> Clarisonic is the best kept skin secret.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> I am able to use the brush twice a day without my skin being too sensitive.</li>
            <li> I feel the Deep Pore Cleasing brush is softer and more comfortable.  </li>
            <li> and I find that I am getting far better cleaning and exfoliation without any harshness or irritation.</li>
            <li> Worth it.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would get deep into the pores but its nothing spectacular.</li>
            <li> This brush is my favorite for my original Clarisonic because I have larger pores.</li>
            <li> had some misgivings about ordering after reading other reviews, but my experience was good.</li>
            <li> Just right.</li>
            <li> It felt like I had to use a whole box of those things to actually clean my nose pores.  </li>
            <li> You only need a drop of facial cleanser and it lathers beautifully.</li>
            <li> I purchased a Clairsonic that came with a gentle head, and wanted a deeper clean.  </li>
            <li> So glad they came out with different brush heads for deep pore cleansings, my skin feels amazing after every use.</li>
            <li> I usually buy at Sephora but while shopping here I came across this great price.</li>
            <li> Great product never had anymore skincare related blemishes only stress which this still aided in with my pro.</li>
            <li> I like this brush head very much over the others.  </li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m buying a deep clean brush head and the bristles are softer than they should be and it does&#x27;t even fit correctly.</li>
            <li> It is gentle and clean my face very well.</li>
            <li> my fines lines desapiered never look better and younger.</li>
            <li> Overall I love Clarisonic and recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I use the deep pore head 2 or 3 times a week :)</li>
            <li> Really affordable and works as advertised!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Clarisonic for about 6 months then just got the deep pore brush and about a monthago and that helped even more.</li>
            <li> It cleans my skin but feels as if it doesn&#x27;t do a great of a job as the regular grey head does.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I will most definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted and arrived in a timely manner</li>
            <li> When I received mine in the mail, I opened it and immediately grabbed my authentic deep pore brush and box(purchased from L&#x27;Oreal company store)and</li>
            <li> authentic has a number on the back, I have #4</li>
            <li> Better pricing for same product if purchased from dermotologist office.  </li>
            <li> I like this brush better than the regular one.</li>
            <li> the real deal!</li>
            <li> This was the first replacement brush I purchased after I received a [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> The blue ring of bristles are stiffer and they do a better job of cleaning and whisking away stuff</li>
            <li> and this is the site to check out first.  </li>
            <li> First, your product will not come in a package.</li>
            <li> I have been using the  Clarisonic brush since they first came out.</li>
            <li> While it is a little softer than I expected ,it worked great!</li>
            <li> I got it yesterday and used last night, compared the one that came with the original machine, this one seems a little smaller, it still fits perfectly.</li>
            <li> My pores are so clear and clean after using this.</li>
            <li> This brand is just as good as the originals which are much more expensive.</li>
            <li> Obviously I love this product - helped clear my skin up completely</li>
            <li> I love the soft touch feel so far.</li>
            <li> I live in AZ and have dry skin, which needs a lot of exfoliating to allow the lotion to work effectively.</li>
            <li> If you have large pores this is the brush for you.</li>
            <li> I like deep exfoliation and exfoliate often because I am very oily and easily clog up.</li>
            <li> however, this is the first time that I have used this particular brush.</li>
            <li> I should&#x27;ve listened to the bad reviews, but there were so many positive 4 &amp; 5 star reviews that I thought the purchase would be a great one.</li>
            <li> Some of the sellers already state that they are generic and fit the Mia, never claiming them to be real.</li>
            <li> I tried replacement brush heads from a competitor and could tell a huge difference in my skin after only a week.  </li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t really suffer any breakouts or dryness from it.  </li>
            <li> But it still didn&#x27;t really do much about the pores on my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I notice much difference from the acne head</li>
            <li> /&gt;Secondly, a real Clarisonic brush head has compact, quality bristles.</li>
            <li> A GENUINE CLARISONIC DEEP PORE BRUSH HEAD:</li>
            <li> Really works around the crevices of my nose.</li>
            <li> So I really like it</li>
            <li> Using this brush with a cleanser every day instantly exfoliates your skin, leaving smooth, youthful looking skin.</li>
            <li> havnt really seen the difference with my clarisonic and this brush head.  </li>
            <li> I normally have very congested pores and have to say I have about an 80% improvement in my skin clarity!</li>
            <li> These are the real deal.</li>
            <li> Works but really 25$?</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast too.</li>
            <li> If you want the real thing...</li>
            <li> Much harsher on the face than the acne brush.</li>
            <li> Works very well, comes with a protective cover for the brush</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who wants a clear/clean face.</li>
            <li> thanks indeed.</li>
            <li> It really helps keep blackheads away and scrub without stripping skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost time to get another one I use it so much.  </li>
            <li> thanks.</li>
            <li> These replacement brush heads are the real thing.</li>
            <li> I requested a return, which was approved, but even though the product is defective I am responsible for the return shipment.</li>
            <li> The Seller (not Amazon) shipped fast and package well.</li>
            <li> and it felt much softer.</li>
            <li> Most definitely not for those with sensitive skin though.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin with large pores and keeping it clean is really essential.    </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about \\&quot;deep pore\\&quot; but it does clean and gently exfoliate the surface of my face.</li>
            <li> This brush head is much better than all of the other ones by Clarisonic.  </li>
            <li> This one cleans much more thoroughly than the other brushes.</li>
            <li> This brush head works well and it does deep clean my face an pores.  </li>
            <li> so maybe it&#x27;ll work for people who do have larger and more apparent pores.  </li>
            <li> So average product just a good brushhead with smaller brissels.</li>
            <li> I have less breakouts and my makeup ALWAYS looks better going on exfoliated skin.</li>
            <li> have large pores on my nose, middle forehead and right under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> plastic on the back is glossy beige/ivory where the authentic one is white and not as glossy(matte).&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I hesitated a long time before buying the brush: hey, couldn&#x27;t  I clean my face just as well?</li>
            <li> I have had the clarisonic set for a few years, this brush replacement came super quick and I noticied a difference in my skin in just 2 nights of use.</li>
            <li> ; normal brush&amp;#34;...</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s a reason these are sold out left and right.</li>
            <li> I am a senior and I look much younger than my years-- no surgery, just the right equipment and brushes, called &#x27;Clarisonic&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> see below for details:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ink and images on box are faded (not as bold as authentic).&lt;br /&gt;The box is supposed to be grey but</li>
            <li> Great price for me to send it back the very next day as well - Does not fit the brush head properly so you don&#x27;t get a deep clean.</li>
            <li> This brush head is okay, but a little too soft for my preference.  </li>
            <li> the brush head doesn&#x27;t look new.</li>
            <li> They sellers contacted me and gave me a New York area code.</li>
            <li> I have no proof that the brush was used, but it didn&#x27;t quite look brand new either.</li>
            <li> My gamble didn&#x27;t net me a genuine Clarisonic Deep Pore Brush Head from FASTVIBES.</li>
            <li> While I have absolutely no problem with the clarisonic deep pore brush (only one that works amazingly on my face) do NOT purchase from the seller, fastvibes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried normal, sensitive and these.</li>
            <li> have bought from retail stores at  a much higher price and now this is the only way to go</li>
            <li> /&gt;Only cost be £5 pound to get genuine one, not worth the risk.</li>
            <li> Easy to use,great little timer to help.</li>
            <li> I bought this type of head because I have oily skin and clogged pores, it was a little scratchy at first, but the brush is now just right for my skin type.  </li>
            <li> The deep pore cleansing brush is just as gentle as the normal and sensitive brush.  </li>
            <li> comes in the real package brand new and was only $9!!!!</li>
            <li> Ordered the single Deep Pore Cleansing brush -- received genuine Clairsonic product.</li>
            <li> just got in the mail today and was extremely fast shipping too wasnt expecting it until next week!</li>
            <li> The Deep Pore Cleansing Brush Head really works.</li>
            <li> The genuine Clarisonic Deep Pore head has a deep blue ring.</li>
            <li> I am 45 years old  </li>
            <li> Its soft</li>
            <li> the brush is too soft</li>
            <li> Bristles are extremely soft for &amp;#34;Deep Pore&amp;#34; cleansing, these are not as dense as the ones you&#x27;d find at sephora or the like.</li>
            <li> I have to buy sensitive</li>
            <li> and I used it for a deep cleaning after an intense workout.  </li>
            <li> My skin is so soft after.</li>
            <li> I used the regular brush head for several weeks and saw an improvement in my skin, but the deep pore one definitely works better around the nose.</li>
            <li> It is definitely &#x27;rougher&#x27; than the gentle and acne-prone heads, but still doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  </li>
            <li> I had the sensitive skin one and switched to this head.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Mine was definitely the real deal in a Clarisonic box with product info.  </li>
            <li> So I did read some comments to stay away if you have somewhat sensitive skin, but I thought I could handle it.</li>
            <li> I was told at a store that the deep pore and sensitive heads are the same softness, but the deep pore has a longer bristle length to reach more deeply.</li>
            <li> Make sure to note that you will break out for a few days after using this brush because it is removing any deep build up.</li>
            <li> It works even better on my skin and no more microderms!</li>
            <li> Be sure only to use every other day or your skin will be stripped and start to get red and irritated.</li>
            <li> I purchased the mia as I want something small that I can easily pack when travelling.    </li>
            <li> Fits and looks clean but fluffy used looking bristles.</li>
            <li> With that being said, it probably will clean the pores, but left my face really red and dry.</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft, not rough at all.</li>
            <li> i got the normal and deep pore</li>
            <li> I think I prefer the sensitive brush more but at least this fits the handle properly so it works.</li>
            <li> These brushes I bought are softer and not like the normal feel of the deep pore cleaning brush heads.</li>
            <li> it is more like a brownish/grey (authentic is grey).&lt;br /&gt;The actual brush head (deep pore) has blue bristles but the blue on the fake is brighter then</li>
            <li> Coincidentally, majority of the sellers with low prices are shipping from New York.</li>
            <li> the same ones from clarisonic but so much cheaper and arrived in only a couple of days!</li>
            <li> Now that I have switched back to Clarisonic brush heads my skin is not only cleaner, but much brighter.</li>
            <li> this is NOT a fake as some other reviews may have stated.</li>
            <li> The six  \\&quot;rays\\&quot; on the white plastic rim are slightly smaller on the counterfeit, and the white outer ring of bristles is much too soft.  </li>
            <li> I work in plastic surgery and have been using high end facial products for over ten years to improve the health of my skin.</li>
            <li> I was having trouble with acne for the first time ever at the age of 33 and tried every product/medicine to help clear it up.</li>
            <li> People always ask me what I do to have such a clear, and youthful complexion.  </li>
            <li> I went back to my sensitive skin brush and skin is relaxed again.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely buy a sensitive skin brush from this seller.</li>
            <li> it may be used - scuff markings, frayed edges are apparent.</li>
            <li> I bought it with the sensitive skin brush, but about once a week or so, I use the deep pore head.  </li>
            <li> I never really did anything special for my face when showering other than wash with body wash or bar soap.  </li>
            <li> It only dawned on me to come to Amazon to order this because I could not get Clarisonic Deep Pore heads at any of my local stores (they were sold out) and my normal online sources were also sold out.</li>
            <li> decided to try this Deep Pore Head after the standard one got old and it is a noticeable improvement.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are arranged different and are somewhat coarser than my regular and sensitive brush heads.</li>
            <li> you get the head, the first thing to tip you off that it&#x27;s not genuine, is the color.</li>
            <li> Feels like an exfoliant so would make your skin sensitive and raw if you use it too much....</li>
            <li> This brush head arrived brand new and as expected.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed that my nose pores look less noticeable and don&#x27;t appear to be clogged like they used to be (as much).  </li>
            <li> B001EJOPWU Buf-Puf Reusable All-Purpose Facial Sponge, Gentle]] could dispatch a black head</li>
            <li> have makeup on for 15-20 hours sometimes- very long days, and this is the only product that i feel like i actually get the old make up and gunk</li>
            <li> I have been a long time user of Clarisonic and decided to buy this deep pore cleaning head replacement instead of the regular one.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I&#x27;m unable to recommend the Clarisonic Replacement Brush Head for Deep Pore Cleansing - single pack from EZ4 Shoppings, as it is not an authentic Clarisonic brush head.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Although I found the Clarisonic oddly pleasant to use, I couldn&#x27;t dispel the uncomfortable feeling that I was some sort of sucker.</li>
            <li> However, when it arrived in the mail, it came in a manila envelop with the brush head inside, whereas the real Clarisonic brush usually comes in a mini box.</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s kind of a pain and a little expensive</li>
            <li> but when I received mine, the blue center bristles were suspiciously not further out nor coarser.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and was a little hesitant on giving this a try.  </li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t had it that long either...</li>
            <li> It may be a bit to harsh for those of you with really sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> and they showed me how the center bristles are further out and coarser than the ones surrounding in order to penetrate your pores.  </li>
            <li> only received 1/2 the order only received 2 brushes and can&#x27;t figure out how to contact to get other 2 brushes being as expected</li>
            <li> When I contacted Clarisonic about my counterfeit product, they said they DO NOT SELL anything but first-quality brush heads and only to retail outlets, NOT bulk-buy resellers or private sellers.this is not true.</li>
            <li> Perhaps there is a specific cleanser to use with this brush that I was not aware of.</li>
            <li> I have larger pores and bought the Clarisonic specifically for this reason based on recommendations from other users and my dermatologist.</li>
            <li> I used the standard brush on my face (but focused extra on my nose) for a few months.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not the same quality, does not fit properly on the Clarisonic &amp; won&#x27;t even rotate.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The bristles are loose and often come loose, even when I am using it on my face.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t realize how much my current brush had worn down until I replaced the head.</li>
            <li> It gets the job done without any issue and helps get the build up deep down in your pores.</li>
            <li> it least 3 monts then you need to replace it for a new one.</li>
            <li> I use it the same way as I used the previous head.  </li>
            <li> Especially those of us who have those irritating little bumps on our complexions that can&#x27;t really be called zits.</li>
            <li> Still too rough for my skin.</li>
            <li> This was just too rough for me.</li>
            <li> If you look at a photo from Clarisonic, you will see that acne brushes are green and not blue.</li>
            <li> They are not real Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> Not really much to add to this product.  </li>
            <li> But as I said, if your skin is sensitive or your skin is thin, you may want to use a regular brush head.</li>
            <li> yes, I know I&#x27;m leaving feedback about a seller and not the product, but I&#x27;d rather have it here where it can be seen and not hidden away under the seller feedback where negative reviews are much harder to access.</li>
            <li> A little tough on the skin at first, but use cautiously.</li>
            <li> It also helps save on cleaning creams,a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> some of the other reviewer stated...</li>
            <li> Using the Clarisonic in general has been a slow process to seeing results</li>
            <li> AND this product was way cheaper here than at Ulta or any other retailers.</li>
            <li> While I occasionally don&#x27;t use it, I usually use the Clairisonic twice a day.</li>
            <li> My acne is due to PCOS</li>
            <li> They products are not real and cannot be used!</li>
            <li> still use the brush, but I use it every other day or every two days.</li>
            <li> Wish it scrubbed harder!</li>
            <li> These brushes seem different than the ones I&#x27;ve had and used in the past with my Clairsonic Brush.</li>
            <li> B0053L2E1O Raw African Black Soap Imported From Ghana 1lb.]</li>
            <li> and I think it was a little too rough.  </li>
            <li> I have had a Clairsonic brush for the past few years and had no idea that there was a deep pore cleansing head.  </li>
            <li> My brush head arrived in a poorly wrapped package and was completely damaged.</li>
            <li> I wish they would come down off the price a bit?</li>
            <li> It got kind of bad and blood on my nose was not uncommon to see at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but the seller has 2 for the price of one or less.</li>
            <li> In less than a week my face felt smoother.</li>
            <li> Less oily</li>
            <li> I have very inflammatory skin and was afraid to try the deep pore, but don&#x27;t be afraid if that&#x27;s your reason for using the sensitive!</li>
            <li> /&gt;**Sellers of counterfeit products will claim they buy seconds or refurbished from Clarisonic; this is not true.</li>
            <li> Does not clean my pores at all.</li>
            <li> The soap has a moisturizer in it and the Clarisonic bristles deliver it a little deeper than washing by hand.</li>
            <li> It may work for others but does little if anything to get the dirt out of my pores.</li>
            <li> The bristles seemed a little worn already, which scared me</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little firmer.</li>
            <li> I have used a few brush types.  </li>
            <li> They almost appear uneven and random.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FOR</li>
            <li> I have repurchased this a few times now.</li>
            <li> This is a counterfeit product and does not fit the Clarisonic brush.</li>
            <li> I was first hesitant about the price of this replacement brush and some of the bad reviews stating that these brushes were not authentic.</li>
            <li> Everytime I use this (usually once a day)</li>
            <li> Shady company.</li>
            <li> Waste of time and Money - Thx!</li>
            <li> I usually replace it about every 3 months, I need to buy one soon.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the brush head does not fit properly on my Mia 2 handle and makes a horrible sound when the handle is turned on.</li>
            <li> eventually forced myself to keep my hands off my face and tried using those nose strips that you apply to your nose with water to remove gunk from your clogged pores.  </li>
            <li> Amazon should shut this seller down !!!  </li>
            <li> Exactly same as expensive clarisonic heads!</li>
            <li> /&gt;This made my cheeks red after a couple days of continuous use and I was peeling:(.</li>
            <li> Then decided to fix what wasn&#x27;t broken and ordered the Pore Cleansing brush.</li>
            <li> but the worst case scenario here is that I basically bought a new head for my clarisonic, which I needed anyway.  </li>
            <li> A year ago I went through some weird phase where I couldn&#x27;t stand seeing the pores on my nose be clogged with skin and gunk</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t seem to be a fake like</li>
            <li> I saw a video on youtube warning people about fake brush head replacements.</li>
            <li> the authentic.&lt;br /&gt;The fake brushes are denser but softer.</li>
            <li> The fake has the #1 in a circle with the numbers 1-9 going around.&lt;br</li>
            <li> immediately saw that it was a fake.</li>
            <li> Check youtube for fake clarisonic brush.</li>
            <li> I bought brush heads from Amazon and they are fake.</li>
            <li> The photo I took shows the packaging of the box and how they counterfeited the product wrong.</li>
            <li> I think a non-branded box as acceptable, but the fake brush isn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is wrong.</li>
            <li> but sorry I can.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> FAKE! :( :( :(</li>
            <li> and I always feel dirty because my skin is insanely oily.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Not bought from Amazon so I can&#x27;t speak about whether or not the item is legit, used or a knockoff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have large pores on my nose, middle forehead and right under my eyes.  I sweat a lot and I always feel dirty because my skin is insanely oily.  I never really did anything special for my face when showering other than wash with body wash or bar soap.  A year ago I went through some weird phase where I couldn&#x27;t stand seeing the pores on my nose be clogged with skin and gunk so I would squeeze them all out.  It is gross, but it messed with my head and I couldn&#x27;t stop thinking about it.  It got kind of bad and blood on my nose was not uncommon to see at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I eventually forced myself to keep my hands off my face and tried using those nose strips that you apply to your nose with water to remove gunk from your clogged pores.  It worked...but never enough.  It felt like I had to use a whole box of those things to actually clean my nose pores.  I gave up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently ended up in possession of the Clarisonic Mia, and gave it a go.  I used the standard brush on my face (but focused extra on my nose) for a few months.  It made my skins really smooth and I didn&#x27;t really suffer any breakouts or dryness from it.  But it still didn&#x27;t really do much about the pores on my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try this Deep Pore Head after the standard one got old and it is a noticeable improvement.  I use it every night while I shower on my face but I focus extra on my nose.  I use it the same way as I used the previous head.  I have noticed that my nose pores look less noticeable and don&#x27;t appear to be clogged like they used to be (as much).  I check out of habit every time I am in front of a mirror and have been thouroughly pleased.</li>
            <li> I know a lot of people have said that this product is not the real replacement brush, however I bought mine from optimum outlet and very pleased to say that it is the REAL clarisonic brush :) comes in the real package brand new and was only $9!!!! will definately be buying from here again for my replacements. just got in the mail today and was extremely fast shipping too wasnt expecting it until next week! 10 stars!</li>
            <li> I like this brush head.  It is gentle and clean my face very well. I like to keep my face very clean.</li>
            <li> Everytime I use this (usually once a day) I find bristles all over my face, the brush is falling apart and I haven&#x27;t had it that long either...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I notice much difference from the acne head I have been using.  This is a fine product though.</li>
            <li> The Deep Pore Cleansing Brush Head really works. My pores are so clear and clean after using this. If you have clogged pores, give this a try.</li>
            <li> I have had the clairsonic mia for about 2 years.  I have used a few brush types.  I have found that they all clean the skin and exfoliate a bit.  I didn&#x27;t find that I had fewer blackheads from using this brush.  I was hoping for more.  Perhaps there is a specific cleanser to use with this brush that I was not aware of.</li>
            <li> It only dawned on me to come to Amazon to order this because I could not get Clarisonic Deep Pore heads at any of my local stores (they were sold out) and my normal online sources were also sold out. I forget sometimes that you can find almost anything here!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read the reviews, including the ones that quesion the authenticity of the heads, and held my breath as I ordered. Well, guess what. My gamble didn&#x27;t net me a genuine Clarisonic Deep Pore Brush Head from FASTVIBES. In fact this is the same counterfeit head that a popular online auction service seller sent me as well (but it&#x27;s listed as genuine Clarisonic). If these had been sold as \\&quot;Replacement\\&quot; or some other wording, great. But no these are sold as genuine Clarisonic heads and they are not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you get the head, the first thing to tip you off that it&#x27;s not genuine, is the color. (I&#x27;m going to post a photo to the product page soon, showing the difference) The genuine Clarisonic Deep Pore head has a deep blue ring. The knockoffs have a lighter blue and it&#x27;s almost a teal color.&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, a real Clarisonic brush head has compact, quality bristles. The others have a fuzzy appearance that look as if someone used it for a month before it was sold. They almost appear uneven and random.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FOR A GENUINE CLARISONIC DEEP PORE BRUSH HEAD: there&#x27;s a reason these are sold out left and right. They are more popular right now than even the sensitive head. I have very inflammatory skin and was afraid to try the deep pore, but don&#x27;t be afraid if that&#x27;s your reason for using the sensitive! I was told at a store that the deep pore and sensitive heads are the same softness, but the deep pore has a longer bristle length to reach more deeply. You&#x27;ll be amazed at what your skin does on this one. I especially love using this at night and seeing how much makeup it drags out of my face. Love it love it!&lt;br /&gt;**Sellers of counterfeit products will claim they buy seconds or refurbished from Clarisonic; this is not true. When I contacted Clarisonic about my counterfeit product, they said they DO NOT SELL anything but first-quality brush heads and only to retail outlets, NOT bulk-buy resellers or private sellers.this is not true.

            <li> This brush head arrived brand new and as expected.  Good price.  However my skin didn&#x27;t agree with the deep pore brush.  I broke out and I think it was a little too rough.  I went back to my sensitive skin brush and skin is relaxed again.  I would definitely buy a sensitive skin brush from this seller.</li>
            <li> I bought Mia 2,claraonic a year ago. Great product. I am 45 years old  My pores are smaller and my face looks radiant.  my fines lines desapiered never look better and younger. Love  the brush it least 3 monts then you need to replace it for a new one.</li>
            <li> Really works around the crevices of my nose. So I really like it and it didn&#x27;t seem to be a fake like some of the other reviewer stated...</li>
            <li> I use the radiance head, so this was a purchase for body use. Still too rough for my skin. Overall I love Clarisonic and recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> Clarisonic is the best kept skin secret. Using this brush with a cleanser every day instantly exfoliates your skin, leaving smooth, youthful looking skin. This deep pore cleansing brush head is the best!</li>
            <li> Im extremly Oily and figured this migth work better...havnt really seen the difference with my clarisonic and this brush head.  Its soft but i usually alternate anyhow.  So average product just a good brushhead with smaller brissels.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and was a little hesitant on giving this a try.  The deep pore cleansing brush is just as gentle as the normal and sensitive brush.  Would recommend trying this.</li>
            <li> I love my clearisonic this brush make me love it so much more I can tell the difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> Have owned and used my Clarisonic for a number of years. This brush is superb!!! My pores have never looked so clean and refined. Superb product all around--as you can see I am a fan of Clarisonic.  Of course this brush was purchased at Amazon for the best price ever. Service was also excellent.  A win-win deal all around.</li>
            <li> I like deep exfoliation and exfoliate often because I am very oily and easily clog up. This was just too rough for me. Great seller and delivery though.</li>
            <li> Clarisonic is a great product and the heads were just what I was expecting.  It helps remove all the makeup before going to bed.</li>
            <li> Exactly same as expensive clarisonic heads! No need to spend all the money for the brand name!!!!</li>
            <li> Very happy for my purchased I&#x27;ll give it for 5 stars</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Great price for this product.  You will pay double at a salon or beauty store.  I was very happy to find this product online.</li>
            <li> Clarisonic users, this is THE brush we&#x27;ve all been waiting for. Especially those of us who have those irritating little bumps on our complexions that can&#x27;t really be called zits. It&#x27;s faster and cheaper than a facial and gives the same results. They are still hard to find in stores, so my advice is to order online; the sooner to enjoy this wonderful brush!</li>
            <li> the brush is too soft</li>
            <li> I really like the deep pore cleansing head, but not for everyday use. Feels like an exfoliant so would make your skin sensitive and raw if you use it too much....PERFECT when pairing it with a &amp;#34; normal brush&amp;#34;...I use the deep pore head 2 or 3 times a week :)</li>
            <li> I have had a Clairsonic brush for the past few years and had no idea that there was a deep pore cleansing head.  I love this!  I normally have very congested pores and have to say I have about an 80% improvement in my skin clarity!</li>
            <li> Great brushes at a great price. Love the clarasonic product and being able to find affordable replaceable brushes is great!</li>
            <li> Really affordable and works as advertised!</li>
            <li> While I have absolutely no problem with the clarisonic deep pore brush (only one that works amazingly on my face) do NOT purchase from the seller, fastvibes. My brush head arrived in a poorly wrapped package and was completely damaged. When I tried contacting the seller, no response. I am now in the process of filing an a-to-z claim through amazon. Whatever you do, don&#x27;t purchase from them! Shady company.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t realize how much my current brush had worn down until I replaced the head.</li>
            <li> Good price! Received it  when expected, and it works perfectly with my clarisonic.</li>
            <li> These are the real deal. I got these because the regular heads did not seem to do what I needed them to do. I live in AZ and have dry skin, which needs a lot of exfoliating to allow the lotion to work effectively. I got these and love them. I use it about 2x a week.</li>
            <li> It works great and arrived on time!</li>
            <li> This brush head is much better than all of the other ones by Clarisonic.  The fibers are softer but more plush and I get a much deeper clean from this head.</li>
            <li> This brush head works well and it does deep clean my face an pores.  It may be a bit to harsh for those of you with really sensitive skin.  My skin is oily and does not naturally exfoliate at a rate I would like so cleaning my face with this brush head is ideal.  My skin is smoother.  But as I said, if your skin is sensitive or your skin is thin, you may want to use a regular brush head.</li>
            <li> I love this brush head!  I had been using the regular one for quite some time and just happened to decide to replace it with the deep pore brush head. I definitely feel like my skin is cleaner and my pores look smaller as well!  Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it yet, but it came in quickly, and I&#x27;m excited to try it out. I had another replacement head that doesn&#x27;t quite fit right, but this one clicked in easily when I checked it</li>
            <li> Bristles are extremely soft for &amp;#34;Deep Pore&amp;#34; cleansing, these are not as dense as the ones you&#x27;d find at sephora or the like. Bristles were super frayed upon receiving.</li>
            <li> Love love love love This product. You cannot beat the price. Cleans your face nice. I have to buy sensitive</li>
            <li> I find it has helped even more with reducing pores. Using the Clarisonic in general has been a slow process to seeing results but I definately have reduced pore size. I&#x27;ve been using the Clarisonic for about 6 months then just got the deep pore brush and about a monthago and that helped even more. I am able to use the brush twice a day without my skin being too sensitive.</li>
            <li> These brushes are the best!!! I&#x27;ve tried normal, sensitive and these. The deep pore are the best for me!!! Love them!!!!</li>
            <li> Works but really 25$? Ok...</li>
            <li> the brush head doesn&#x27;t look new. it may be used - scuff markings, frayed edges are apparent. the item was not wrapped in plastic.</li>
            <li> I have been a long time user of Clarisonic and decided to buy this deep pore cleaning head replacement instead of the regular one. It cleans my skin but feels as if it doesn&#x27;t do a great of a job as the regular grey head does.&lt;br /&gt;I do not think I will reorder.</li>
            <li> Excellent for my face.</li>
            <li> I had been warned that the product wouldn&#x27;t be an original from another review? LIE! The brushes are authentic and worked wonderfully! I will most definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> Clarisonic replacement brush heads perfect. Exactly what I wanted and arrived in a timely manner&lt;br /&gt;I have bought from retail stores at  a much higher price and now this is the only way to go&lt;br /&gt;5 stars</li>
            <li> Just right. No problem.</li>
            <li> My skin needed this deep pore cleansing. Love the brush. Shipping was fast too. Very satisfied with the Clarisonic line of products.</li>
            <li> If you like a strong brush head than this is it.  The &amp;#34;Deep Pore&amp;#34; brushes are too strong for me, so I use the &amp;#34;Delicate&amp;#34; brush heads instead.  This brand is just as good as the originals which are much more expensive.</li>
            <li> I saw a video on youtube warning people about fake brush head replacements. I purchased 2 deep pore brushes from \\&quot;office local.\\&quot; When I received mine in the mail, I opened it and immediately grabbed my authentic deep pore brush and box(purchased from L&#x27;Oreal company store)and noticed a bunch of differences. see below for details:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ink and images on box are faded (not as bold as authentic).&lt;br /&gt;The box is supposed to be grey but it is more like a brownish/grey (authentic is grey).&lt;br /&gt;The actual brush head (deep pore) has blue bristles but the blue on the fake is brighter then the authentic.&lt;br /&gt;The fake brushes are denser but softer. The authentic is not dense. It is firmer.&lt;br /&gt;The plastic on the back is glossy beige/ivory where the authentic one is white and not as glossy(matte).&lt;br /&gt;The authentic has a number on the back, I have #4 and then there are some circles. The fake has the #1 in a circle with the numbers 1-9 going around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I immediately saw that it was a fake. More than one customer has screamed fake and the company continues to sell. If you are into knock offs...this is for you. If you want the real thing...Remember for one brush its about $25 but the seller has 2 for the price of one or less. I contacted amazon and as always, they were able to help. Good luck! Check youtube for fake clarisonic brush.</li>
            <li> Better pricing for same product if purchased from dermotologist office.  good value</li>
            <li> I work in plastic surgery and have been using high end facial products for over ten years to improve the health of my skin. I recently added the Clarisonic skin cleaning system to my skin care regimine as it was recommended to me as the safest and most effective cleansing system&lt;br /&gt;for my skin. After just two days, I noticed that my skin was softer, smoother and brighter in appearance.  It was like having a microdermabrasion treatment at home for a percentage of the cost! The deep pore brush is the perfect supplement to my skin care products!</li>
            <li> Fits perfectly in my clarisonic MIA.. mine came wrapped in the original box.. had some misgivings about ordering after reading other reviews, but my experience was good.</li>
            <li> This is an authentic Clarisonic replacement brush head.  Arrived last night and I used it for a deep cleaning after an intense workout.  My skin has not looked this good in a while. I don&#x27;t always have time for facials but the results I got from one use mimics a great facial.  Will definitely be making this part of my regular beauty routine.</li>
            <li> Had been using the acne brush with good results. Then decided to fix what wasn&#x27;t broken and ordered the Pore Cleansing brush. Much harsher on the face than the acne brush. With that being said, it probably will clean the pores, but left my face really red and dry.</li>
            <li> This product leaves my face feeling refreshed and clean. I have less breakouts and my makeup ALWAYS looks better going on exfoliated skin. Love Clarisonic!</li>
            <li> I thought because it had the &#x27;Clarisonic&#x27; name, it would be the same as the ones I purchase from my salon, but that was not the case. The bristles are loose and often come loose, even when I am using it on my face. Won&#x27;t be purchasing online again.</li>
            <li> Always works well for my clarisonic pro. I am wondering though if the newer &amp;#34;pro&amp;#34; since I do not remember the name is compatible. Great product never had anymore skincare related blemishes only stress which this still aided in with my pro.</li>
            <li> Same as Macy&#x27;s but cheaper, pleased with product I love amazon and the savings they provide. Always pleased with my purchases</li>
            <li> the same ones from clarisonic but so much cheaper and arrived in only a couple of days! i got the normal and deep pore and i love them both!</li>
            <li> I bought brush heads from Amazon and they are fake.I have proof but my photo keeps getting deleted and I do not know how to keep it there. The photo I took shows the packaging of the box and how they counterfeited the product wrong. The photo showed a blue brush for acne cleansing. If you look at a photo from Clarisonic, you will see that acne brushes are green and not blue. These brushes have counterfeit boxes and I&#x27;m pretty sure the brushes are counterfeit as well because after a week, they carried this stench that never happened before when I bought the brushes off Clarisonic. I understand they are cheap but these sellers should not be able to claim they are Clarisonic brand when they are not! They sellers contacted me and gave me a New York area code. I did some research and checked eBay and I found a ton of sellers with prices very low just like Amazon. Some of the sellers already state that they are generic and fit the Mia, never claiming them to be real. Coincidentally, majority of the sellers with low prices are shipping from New York. (Some of the photos on eBay have the photo of the blue brush head on the box of a acne cleansing)</li>
            <li> I was having trouble with acne for the first time ever at the age of 33 and tried every product/medicine to help clear it up. This item has not only cleared my face of all acne but keeps it from coming back. Very glad I purchased this. AND this product was way cheaper here than at Ulta or any other retailers. Very Pleased!</li>
            <li> A little tough on the skin at first, but use cautiously. It works well and leaves your skin soft and flawless! The clairsonic has changed my life!</li>
            <li> Obviously I love this product - helped clear my skin up completely</li>
            <li> I love the clairsonic. The deep pore replacement brush is made to attach to the clarisonic perfectly. It gets the job done without any issue and helps get the build up deep down in your pores. Make sure to note that you will break out for a few days after using this brush because it is removing any deep build up.</li>
            <li> I used to use the regular brush (white).  I feel the Deep Pore Cleasing brush is softer and more comfortable.  I like this brush better than the regular one.</li>
            <li> If you want a good complexion--the best complexion--this is it.  Clarisonic.  People always ask me what I do to have such a clear, and youthful complexion.  It is all about the Clarisonic.  I am a senior and I look much younger than my years-- no surgery, just the right equipment and brushes, called &#x27;Clarisonic&#x27;.  P.S.  I am in no way affiliated to the company.</li>
            <li> I hesitated a long time before buying the brush: hey, couldn&#x27;t  I clean my face just as well? Well, the answer is no - I have to admit there is a big difference in skin texture and tone since I started using the Clarisonic.  I purchased the mia as I want something small that I can easily pack when travelling.    While I occasionally don&#x27;t use it, I usually use the Clairisonic twice a day. I bought it with the sensitive skin brush, but about once a week or so, I use the deep pore head.  I have oily skin with large pores and keeping it clean is really essential.    If you have any doubts, go for this!</li>
            <li> The best brush for the Mia. Makes your face feel like a facial every time. It&#x27;s very important to take care of your skin &amp; this brush will keep you looking great for years to come.</li>
            <li> They are not real Clarisonic. The bristles on the brush are shorter and discolored. The bristles are rougher , the result being my face feels chapped instead of smooth.</li>
            <li> Ordered the single Deep Pore Cleansing brush -- received genuine Clairsonic product. Works very well, comes with a protective cover for the brush that&#x27;s good if you travel with it.</li>
            <li> Love my Clarisonic and am so glad they came out with different brushes. I have blackhead problems so this is the one for more.</li>
            <li> I was having acne issues and finally went to see a dermatologist.  My acne is due to PCOS so it&#x27;s hormonal.  As part of my on-going regimen, my doctor recommended that I purchase the Clarisonic Cleanser.  I purchased the replacement brushes for deep pore cleansing and it works wonderfully.  I would recommend this to anyone who wants a clear/clean face.</li>
            <li> I tried replacement brush heads from a competitor and could tell a huge difference in my skin after only a week.  The competitors brush heads do not have nearly as many bristles as the original Clarisonic does.  Now that I have switched back to Clarisonic brush heads my skin is not only cleaner, but much brighter.</li>
            <li> I am SOOO happy with it all. I got my order quickly and it works perfectly with my Clarisonic :) I will definitely be a repeat costumer, I am very pleased with this transaction! The product is great and the seller was excellent.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice the difference between the pore cleaning brush and the regular head that comes with the Clarisonic. They both give my skin a phenomenal deep cleanse and feel really good while doing so. The bristles are soft, not rough at all. You only need a drop of facial cleanser and it lathers beautifully. I actually use [[ASIN:B0053L2E1O Raw African Black Soap Imported From Ghana 1lb.]] with the Clarisonic and get really great results. The soap has a moisturizer in it and the Clarisonic bristles deliver it a little deeper than washing by hand. My skin is so soft after. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Didnt fit my clarisonic</li>
            <li> I used the head for normal skin, vut decided to try this one, and I&#x27;m glad I did! It works even better on my skin and no more microderms!</li>
            <li> I saw the brush at Sephora when it came out and they showed me how the center bristles are further out and coarser than the ones surrounding in order to penetrate your pores.  Since amazon always has better deals, I bought it from here but when I received mine, the blue center bristles were suspiciously not further out nor coarser.  I don&#x27;t know if I just received a defective one but the worst case scenario here is that I basically bought a new head for my clarisonic, which I needed anyway.  If it&#x27;s shrinking my pores then that&#x27;s a plus, I&#x27;ll probably order this one again just in case it does provide that added benefit.  Most people say they don&#x27;t see my pores to begin with and I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference so maybe it&#x27;ll work for people who do have larger and more apparent pores.  Also, don&#x27;t forget to change your clarisonic head.  I know it&#x27;s kind of a pain and a little expensive but.... over time, it will catch up to you and your skin will start to break out from the bacteria build up.  Trust me, it&#x27;s happened too many times and I&#x27;ve learned my lesson.</li>
            <li> I bought the deep pore cleansing brushes when I had break-outs and I am very happy with my complexion now.  My skin is radiant and even toned. I am very pleased with the service I always receive from Amazon.  I was able to find them at a great price.  Hooray for Clarisonic!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I&#x27;m unable to recommend the Clarisonic Replacement Brush Head for Deep Pore Cleansing - single pack from EZ4 Shoppings, as it is not an authentic Clarisonic brush head.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not the same quality, does not fit properly on the Clarisonic &amp; won&#x27;t even rotate.&lt;br /&gt;I have used Clarisonic products for many years &amp; have never had this issue before.</li>
            <li> I appreciate the difference in this brush and the brush that came with the Clarisonic.  It definitely is firmer and seems to do what it is advertised to do.</li>
            <li> Brush came in nondescript cardboard box; no clarisonic box. Is it refurbished?  Fits and looks clean but fluffy used looking bristles. FAKE! :( :( :(</li>
            <li> the real deal! this is NOT a fake as some other reviews may have stated. It is perfect and my favorite brush for my clarisonic mia.</li>
            <li> Awesome brush. If you have large pores this is the brush for you. I have repurchased this a few times now.</li>
            <li> Cheeper than department stores, love my Clarsonic Brush, by the way invest in the Opal as well. It Works with a eye serum and eye cream over thar</li>
            <li> This works great just like I knew that it would and I am very happy with it. I would order it again.</li>
            <li> This brush head really does work better at getting hard-to-reach areas clean. I used the regular brush head for several weeks and saw an improvement in my skin, but the deep pore one definitely works better around the nose. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I really love this product. This one cleans much more thoroughly than the other brushes. Very pleased with this product!</li>
            <li> huge change in my pore size after using this, i love the clairsonic, i feel like my skins overall health has improved alot!</li>
            <li> this is very good quality product, as good as the one with original machine. we are happy this shopping. we will come again. thanks indeed.</li>
            <li> This brush is my favorite for my original Clarisonic because I have larger pores. It really helps keep blackheads away and scrub without stripping skin. I&#x27;ve found that the brush works best when used with a cream based face wash.</li>
            <li> only received 1/2 the order only received 2 brushes and can&#x27;t figure out how to contact to get other 2 brushes being as expected 4 brushes only got 2</li>
            <li> have makeup on for 15-20 hours sometimes- very long days, and this is the only product that i feel like i actually get the old make up and gunk off- my face always feels clean when i use this. it&#x27;s easier to order from amazon then chase around the department stores to find replacements. love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost time to get another one I use it so much.  This is the best head out of all of the ones I&#x27;ve bought, it really does clean deeper than the others.</li>
            <li> ahh mon figure needed that. thanks.</li>
            <li> Best face cleaning device - I am always complemented on my beautiful skin when I buy makeup - a florida plastic surgeon recommended when I went for waxing - bought two - one for each house - truly love it</li>
            <li> The picture showed two and I only received one. Other than that it works great didn&#x27;t have any problems attaching it!</li>
            <li> Love it! In less than a week my face felt smoother. Easy to use,great little timer to help. I bought this for myself and I&#x27;m glad I did. It also helps save on cleaning creams,a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This was the first replacement brush I purchased after I received a [[ASIN:B005YB36RY Clarisonic Skin Care Mia 2 Sonic Skin Cleansing System]] as a gift. Although I found the Clarisonic oddly pleasant to use, I couldn&#x27;t dispel the uncomfortable feeling that I was some sort of sucker. A Clarisonic is, after all, an electric wash cloth. Was I being gullible?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; brush that came with the unit massaged nicely but didn&#x27;t clean or exfoliate all that well. The tiny blackhead in the fold of my nose refused to budge despite any effort by the Clarisonic. 5 brisk seconds with a trusty [[ASIN:B001EJOPWU Buf-Puf Reusable All-Purpose Facial Sponge, Gentle]] could dispatch a black head better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I switched to this \\&quot;Deep Pore\\&quot; brush and I find that I am getting far better cleaning and exfoliation without any harshness or irritation. The blue ring of bristles are stiffer and they do a better job of cleaning and whisking away stuff you don&#x27;t want. I don&#x27;t know about \\&quot;deep pore\\&quot; but it does clean and gently exfoliate the surface of my face.</li>
            <li> I like this brush head very much over the others.  It actually has made my pores look smaller.  I am in my 60&amp;#34;s, so if you are on the fence I suggest you use it next time you need a replacement.  I use it with my Mia 2.</li>
            <li> I bought this type of head because I have oily skin and clogged pores, it was a little scratchy at first, but the brush is now just right for my skin type.  Most definitely not for those with sensitive skin though.</li>
            <li> Like others have said, I&#x27;ve used the actual article before.  I also give an actual Deep Pore Cleansing brush five stars.  What I received from the seller Pro-Natural was what I believe to be a counterfeit brush, and not one produced by Clarisonic.  The six  \\&quot;rays\\&quot; on the white plastic rim are slightly smaller on the counterfeit, and the white outer ring of bristles is much too soft.  These don&#x27;t stay in their discrete tufts, and bend much to easily when in contact with anything.  I think a non-branded box as acceptable, but the fake brush isn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And yes, I know I&#x27;m leaving feedback about a seller and not the product, but I&#x27;d rather have it here where it can be seen and not hidden away under the seller feedback where negative reviews are much harder to access.</li>
            <li> I have used a Clarisonic for several years. These replacement brush heads are the real thing. Great and gentle exfoliation and cleaning.</li>
            <li> I was worried this replacement head might be too abrasive, but it&#x27;s not.  It is definitely &#x27;rougher&#x27; than the gentle and acne-prone heads, but still doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  I feel like my pores are somewhat clearer after about two months.</li>
            <li> Replaced old brush head quickly and perfectly.  Works great.</li>
            <li> Works great, arrived in plastic wrap no box. Great bargain makes getting  an extra brush affordable. I would order again!! Worth it.</li>
            <li> I purchased a Clairsonic that came with a gentle head, and wanted a deeper clean.  This was a great price, much lower than retail, it was a quick ship, and the product is exactly what I was looking for.  A fabulous clean for face and neck, giving the perfect canvas for moisturizers.  Very pleased.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice product! It was a good buy and my daughter uses it every day. I recommend this product!</li>
            <li> See my review for the Clarisonic Replacement Brush. Every woman should have a Clarisonic, no matter which one it is and this is the site to check out first.  You will be very pleased with the prices.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I choose this type,hope it can make my skin more cleaner,It is good,I will use it</li>
            <li> I loved this product! I have used the Clarisonic for over a year now however, this is the first time that I have used this particular brush. While it is a little softer than I expected ,it worked great!</li>
            <li> So glad they came out with different brush heads for deep pore cleansings, my skin feels amazing after every use. Be sure only to use every other day or your skin will be stripped and start to get red and irritated.</li>
            <li> Good product; cleans better that the original brush.</li>
            <li> I should&#x27;ve listened to the bad reviews, but there were so many positive 4 &amp; 5 star reviews that I thought the purchase would be a great one. Unfortunately, the brush head does not fit properly on my Mia 2 handle and makes a horrible sound when the handle is turned on. I requested a return, which was approved, but even though the product is defective I am responsible for the return shipment. This is wrong. I will from now on only purchase items fulfilled by Amazon.</li>
            <li> Love clarisonic!! My skin is always smooth. Combine with a great cleaner product and the results are great (I use Bliss fabulous)</li>
            <li> This brush head is okay, but a little too soft for my preference.  I wish it was more of a scrubber.</li>
            <li> some people cant tell the difference between the true Clarisonic brushes but sorry I can.&lt;br /&gt;This one is a nice addition to my routine. The bristles are arranged different and are somewhat coarser than my regular and sensitive brush heads. For my son I do buy the generic ones and I get the pore ones for him and let him use it for his acne.</li>
            <li> As with all official Clarisonic products, this one works great.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a replacement for my  clarisonic mia, it fits perfectly but having bought a genuine replacement brush from clarisonic and comparing them both obvious that it isn&#x27;t genuine, the bristles on the brushes felt completely different. I therefore never actually used this brush so can&#x27;t say if it was as effective as genuine one but I simply don&#x27;t want to use a product i&#x27;m unsure is genuine and therefore the clarisonic performing the best it can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only cost be £5 pound to get genuine one, not worth the risk.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product thinking that it would be the Clarisonic brand brush head. However, when it arrived in the mail, it came in a manila envelop with the brush head inside, whereas the real Clarisonic brush usually comes in a mini box.</li>
            <li> Does not clean my pores at all. I have larger pores and bought the Clarisonic specifically for this reason based on recommendations from other users and my dermatologist. It may work for others but does little if anything to get the dirt out of my pores. I use it to clean/prepare my skin for Retin-A which seems to work far better!</li>
            <li> My favorite brush head!</li>
            <li> I think I prefer the sensitive brush more but at least this fits the handle properly so it works.</li>
            <li> What a difference a new brush head makes; the old one seemed still good but after many months (maybe even a year) the new brush reminds me of how good the product is when first received!</li>
            <li> It does what is it was ment to do deep cleaning. Amazing</li>
            <li> Not really much to add to this product.  If you own a Clarisonic, you need no convincing on how awesome they are for your skin.  I specifically purchased this head to address the pores on my nose, which is does quite well.  Good purchase!</li>
            <li> First, your product will not come in a package. However, it is sealed in a plastic bag. The brush does not appear to be refurbished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am glad that I ordered. I love my Clarisonic and this brush is just what my skin ordered. I have noticed a difference in just a week of using this brush. I will order again..</li>
            <li> Excellent product. My skin feels so smooth after use. I had the sensitive skin one and switched to this head. Not disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have had the clarisonic set for a few years, this brush replacement came super quick and I noticied a difference in my skin in just 2 nights of use. I am usually not a strict follower of change the head every 3 months but with this there is a huge difference!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only purchased replacements from the store before I ordered this brush. The bristles seemed a little worn already, which scared me so I tried my best to disinfect the brush before use. I have no proof that the brush was used, but it didn&#x27;t quite look brand new either. I&#x27;ll will just continue buying them at ULTA from now on to be safe.</li>
            <li> I love this brush head!  It leaves my skin feeling clean.  Plus, this is the softest brush head I&#x27;ve found and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I was first hesitant about the price of this replacement brush and some of the bad reviews stating that these brushes were not authentic. After going back and forth for awhile, I decided to e-mail the seller (in my case, Optimum Outlet) and asked whether this replacement brush came in an original Clairsonic Manufacture&#x27;s package and they said it did. I got the product and used it with no problem. From now on, I&#x27;ll be buying the replacement Clairsonic brushes from Amazon and from Optimum Outlet.</li>
            <li> When I was buying this there seemed to be a lot of reviews doubting whether it was indeed a Clarisonic branded product or a knock-off.  Mine was definitely the real deal in a Clarisonic box with product info.  Its a stiffer brush head than I&#x27;m used to but I&#x27;m getting used to it.</li>
            <li> I like my clarisonic but I can&#x27;t tell a difference between this brush and the regular one the product comes with. I was hoping this would get deep into the pores but its nothing spectacular.</li>
            <li> I got it yesterday and used last night, compared the one that came with the original machine, this one seems a little smaller, it still fits perfectly. I love the soft touch feel so far.</li>
            <li> Good quality, appears to be  Clarisonic, not fake.  I got this brush as I tend to have breakouts.  Have used for over a month and no issues the quality.  Would recommend!</li>
            <li> The Seller (not Amazon) shipped fast and package well. Clarisonic Replacement brush head fit my Mia 2 correctly. Deep Pore brush is a great brush to use for my skin</li>
            <li> I have cystic acne and I love this brush better than I like the acne brush because it cleans my pores a lot better than the acne head did.  It&#x27;s a little firmer.</li>
            <li> The brush was exactly as pictured, fit my Clarisonic well and seemed authentic. Came in the original box. I like my other brush head better, however, Im using this and felt it was a good value.</li>
            <li> This is a counterfeit product and does not fit the Clarisonic brush. I have been using the  Clarisonic brush since they first came out. I usually buy at Sephora but while shopping here I came across this great price. Great price for me to send it back the very next day as well - Does not fit the brush head properly so you don&#x27;t get a deep clean. So I&#x27;m buying a deep clean brush head and the bristles are softer than they should be and it does&#x27;t even fit correctly. Amazon should shut this seller down !!!  They products are not real and cannot be used! Waste of time and Money - Thx!</li>
            <li> So I did read some comments to stay away if you have somewhat sensitive skin, but I thought I could handle it. Plus, it was a really good deal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This made my cheeks red after a couple days of continuous use and I was peeling:(. I have oily skin, mind you so that was crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still use the brush, but I use it every other day or every two days. My skin still sees the benefits though even though I don&#x27;t use it that often. It actually looks great. I might get the regular brush head for daily use and for those times where I feel I need deep pore cleaning use this brush.</li>
            <li> This is a genuine, brand new clarisonic head securely wrapped and sealed?  I wish they would come down off the price a bit?</li>
            <li> Does the job well. No issues.</li>
            <li> Wish it scrubbed harder!</li>
            <li> This brush is perfect for me. It&#x27;s very gentle and you really do feel like your skin is so clean; better than using your fingers...I definitely noticed a difference in the texture and appearance of my skin- Less oily and it felt much softer.</li>
            <li> Great cleaning with the Clarisonic dee pore cleansing brush.  I usually replace it about every 3 months, I need to buy one soon.  Way better than the Sensitve brush.</li>
            <li> These brushes seem different than the ones I&#x27;ve had and used in the past with my Clairsonic Brush. These brushes I bought are softer and not like the normal feel of the deep pore cleaning brush heads.</li>
