            <li>This product has been amazing with evening out my skin.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing; I cannot believe the brighter, rosy glow in my complexion after just one use.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing and feels divine.</li>
            <li>You can feel it effectively exfoliating (scratchy feeling) the face.</li>
            <li>everything mentioned was bought with my own money or included in another subscription box I paid for.</li>
            <li>Nice smell, nice feel.</li>
            <li>kind of thing.</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s nice that this works with alternative ingredients.</li>
            <li>And Vasanti is a nice company.</li>
            <li>but effective.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like your own microdermabrasion treatment at home.</li>
            <li>Worth EVERY penny!!!</li>
            <li>Perfect for my 53 yr old skin!</li>
            <li>It has a very very fine consistency.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best exfoliator I&#x27;ve found that has a reasonable price, and I enjoy the way my skin feels after using it.</li>
            <li>Smells very nice, leaves my skin soft and bright.</li>
            <li>Works best if skin is damp, not wet.</li>
            <li>After using it the first time, my skin felt great.</li>
            <li>In general, this has been the best anti-acne step I&#x27;ve used EVER!</li>
            <li>I loved it and immediately purchased the full sized product.</li>
            <li>The consistency is more like very fine salt or sugar - not as course as sand.    </li>
            <li>I have never seen it before, so I had to search Amazon to get more, when my sample ran out.  </li>
            <li>most is that it does not over-exfoliate.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really gentle and skin feels great afterwards.  </li>
            <li>it isnt my favorite</li>

            <li>Great exfoliant yet gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li>oh boy is this face wash magical.</li>

            <li>so I&#x27;m ordering more.</li>

            <li>Love this product ,,,,,,</li>
            <li>but of course it sounds better with the marketing word &amp;#34;enzymatic&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glycerin, Cetyl Alcohol, Emulsifying Wax,</li>

            <li>many organic products</li>
            <li>I use it 3 times a week, any more than that</li>
            <li>My sister had tried it and fell in love.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I am glad I found this product</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been feeling the need to do something more to care for the skin on my face, but so many exfoliants are just too harsh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li>More pores look cleaner and the tone is better as well.</li>

            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>My face looks much much better now.  </li>
            <li>Okay so I got a sample of this in my monthly birch box</li>
            <li>I love this exfoliator.</li>
            <li>I Love this product.  </li>
            <li>I got a sample of this in my birchbox and fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample of this, I think in a birch box, and fell in love.</li>
            <li>Very fine grained and gentle but effective!</li>
            <li>Received as a birch box sample and instantly fell in love!!!</li>
            <li>I told everybody about how amazing it is and received 3 full size tubes for my birthday.</li>
            <li>I normally use NIA24 scrub, but sometimes my skin didn&#x27;t respond greatly to that.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth it!!</li>
            <li>I got this product originally as a sample and had to have it!</li>
            <li>Very excited to purchase the full size product after I finish up my sample!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very light scrub and it leaves the skin even toned and smooth.</li>
            <li>Best scrub I used in a long time-very fine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very gentle and perfect for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>lol I use it more frequently than suggested, and it works great for me as a daily cleanser.</li>
            <li>Buying the full size now!</li>
            <li>Originally got this as a sample in my Birchbox -- LOVE it.</li>
            <li>Tried a sampler that came in my birch box and had to buy the full size bottle once I ran out!</li>
            <li>but NOOO hesitation on buying a full size!</li>
            <li>YES THEY ARE ALL TRUE!</li>
            <li>I love how easy it is to use, and how fresh it makes my face feel!</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much, I don&#x27;t notice any change in my skin tone and honestly I use so many products I wouldn&#x27;t realize if this did anything but exfoliate or not.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t a wrinkle reducer but is a very gentle, yet effective exfoliant.  </li>
            <li>I thought I would give this a try even though anything with &amp;#34;exfoliate&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;peel&amp;#34; in the description scares me to death because my ultra fair skin is very sensitive.  </li>
            <li>Love the packaging, too; easy to store in the shower and get out just the right amount of product.</li>
            <li>love love love this product - makes my face super soft and smooth!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since I started buying the product, I saw a huge difference.</li>
            <li>My skin is more radiant, and rarely ever gets flaky.  </li>
            <li>great size package should last awhile.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fantastic .</li>
            <li>This is worth every penny and more.</li>
            <li>Smooth and renewed.</li>
            <li>etc- allows for the &amp;#34;slip&amp;#34; and smooth texture, acts as emulsifier to bind the scrub together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>b/c the scrub is so effective and gentle --</li>
            <li>This is such a great face cleanser.</li>
            <li>I have been on a skin care kick lately making this item a perfect fit!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a good facial cleanser and use organic lotions/body washes (that I LOVE)</li>
            <li>It smells nice, it feels great on my skin and the exfoliating crystals are not too harsh.</li>
            <li>My skin feel sop good after using it and it also helped clear my skin up.</li>
            <li>Noticed a difference after the FIRST use!!</li>
            <li>When I wash it off, it leaves my skin feeling smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>two full bottles later I am still a happy customer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thank you Birchbox for such an amazing find!</li>
            <li>Upon first use, I was in love with this.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>The micro-crystals: you don&#x27;t feel them on your hands or fingers, but they feel sharp on your face (in a good way!).</li>
            <li>Originally got the sample through Birch Box, and it changed my life.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s soooo worth it!</li>
            <li>I received this originally in a subscription bag for beauty products.</li>
            <li>I know the terms &amp;#34;gentle&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;effective exfoliant&amp;#34; sound mutually exclusive, the both are true.</li>
            <li>Like many reviewers, I first learned about this product through Birchbox, which gave me a 20g sample size.</li>
            <li>I originally received this as a sample in a Birchbox...</li>
            <li>/&gt;This rinses off cleanly and doesn&#x27;t leave residue or clog pores.</li>
            <li>I clean my forehead, nose, and chin</li>
            <li>By far the best facial scrub out there!</li>
            <li>and it rinses clean.</li>
            <li>Instantly fell in love and ran out and purchased it.&lt;br /&gt;It feels so amazing while using it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely a rougher and probably more effective exfoliation.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels so clean after cleansing.</li>
            <li>Ive spent most of my post adolescent years searching for a good exfoliant.</li>
            <li>I got a sample via Birch Box and used it with my clarisonic - the results were amazing and my skin felt brighter and very soft.  </li>
            <li>One recommendation that I have is to use this on clean skin as it truly is a brightener, not a face wash; it is not meant to remove a full face of makeup.</li>
            <li>A nice, gentle fine scrub on the face versus large apricot pits digging at your skin.</li>
            <li>Skin always feels amazing and soft after use.</li>
            <li>My face is always bright red for a while after washing</li>
            <li>Love this, can really tell the difference in my complexion and the feel of my face</li>
            <li>I received a sample size in one of my monthly beauty bags and immediately purchased the full size.  </li>
            <li>This is my absolute favorite birch box sample of all time.</li>
            <li>I knew I had to have the full size bottle.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a gentle exfoliator unlike so many exfoliators I&#x27;ve tried that were abrasive and irritated my skin.  </li>
            <li>Received a sample of this and HAD to buy the full size.</li>
            <li>Skin is already &amp;#34;calm&amp;#34; and cool.</li>
            <li>full size.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It came on time and it was full.</li>
            <li>, I got a sample in my birchbox and I decided I needed a full size.</li>
            <li>The reason I don&#x27;t give 5 stars is because it is not as full as it looks.</li>
            <li>I will be ordering full size.  </li>
            <li>a true &amp;#34;polish&amp;#34</li>
            <li>So I had to have the full product.  </li>
            <li>A true holy grail for me</li>
            <li>My skin looks good and i even noticed red acne marks reduced.</li>
            <li>I HAD to order the full size.</li>
            <li>When cleansing your face make sure you are using adequate water and use a gentle circular motion on your face.</li>
            <li>That is because I have experimented and tried MANY skin care products, due to my condition, and those specific products work best for me.</li>
            <li>But other than that, a great product.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s great for other parts of the body</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t irritating and leaves my skin feeling so smooth and flawless.</li>
            <li>I would recommend to anyone for a mild exfoliant.</li>
            <li>Very gentle to my skin while leaving it smooth.</li>
            <li>After the very first use, I knew this item was for me.</li>
            <li>but I felt the price for the amount of product I got (about 2/3 of a bottle) was fair considering how long it lasts.</li>
            <li>i like it and its pretty nice for being 99% natural.</li>
            <li>Occasionally I&#x27;ll use it with my clarisonic, but I think it&#x27;s better just to use your hands over your face for the recommended 2-3 minutes, because the product will disappear into the clarisonic&#x27;s brush pretty quickly - clarisonic better with foaming soaps for that reason.    </li>
            <li>I very rarely purchase the full size of anything because I don&#x27;t like to spend too much money on these types of products, but this is one I would make an exception for.</li>
            <li>I usually do not care for enzymatic products but love this one.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re sensitive to the scratchy feeling some exfoliating can cause this product may not be very comfortable.</li>
            <li>I recently tried out their BrightenUp face wash and it is AMAZING.  </li>
            <li>Keeps my skin feeling very silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>people have had success with this product.</li>
            <li>(Someone with more sensitive skin might want to hold it at the three minute mark.)</li>
            <li>I rarely have breakouts and</li>
            <li>and so always when I run out of something fabulous, I check Amazon and sure enough - Amazon has it!  </li>
            <li>Skin feels fresh and clean.&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;m</li>
            <li>glad i don&#x27;t have sensitive skin though.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>His skin is much more sensitive to products than mine.</li>
            <li>I think it is well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Bought my own and never looked back.</li>
            <li>This was a bit of a splurge, but it&#x27;s been worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>The investment has proved well worth it, as the tube has lasted me 9 months (and counting).</li>
            <li>My moisturizer was almost instantly absorbed after cleansing with this scrub.</li>
            <li>After washing with this nightly for a week my skin was visibly more clear.</li>
            <li>I find it works best by first wetting your face, then dispersing a small amount on your hand and then applying in gentle circular motions to your face and neck.  </li>
            <li>Very fine sand like feel but not rough on skin.</li>
            <li>I received it as a sample from Birchbox, and got hooked pretty quick.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really do amazon reviews, but this is seriously THE BEST bargain for an exfoliator.  </li>
            <li>It is great for a quick exfoliating scrub, or you can leave it on like a mask for a few extra minutes and let the enzymes do their thing for even better results.</li>
            <li>The enzyme results aren&#x27;t quite as noticeable right away, but do show up over time, I think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I returned the product to the company and the honored my refund right away.</li>
            <li>I usually use Dr. Lancer&#x27;s face scrub, but this is finer and even more effective.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use, no noticeable smell, and does not irritate my very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have found that exfoliation is great for breakout avoidance, in general, and this is probably one of my favorite exfoliators (and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of them in the past</li>
            <li>A good face wash is hard to find and this stuff is seriously the best.</li>
            <li>This is a great daily facial scrub!</li>
            <li>But trust me, it is definitely worth it, works much better than commercial scrubs.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely loved it because it had little scrubbing bits in it</li>
            <li>It makes your face feel baby soft, even after the very first use!</li>
            <li>I love how tiny micro-crystals are.</li>
            <li>I feel like this is the extra boost my skin needs to look fabulous for summer!</li>
            <li>I first sampled this product when I received it in a BirchBox subscription.</li>
            <li>I could notice a difference after the first use.</li>
            <li>NOT the same product that I bought from another (apparently more legitimate) retailer.  </li>
            <li>This stuff FINALLY provided the results I&#x27;ve wanted to see for so many years.  </li>
            <li>it is magic to your face, it clears up your skin almost instantly.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what is says it will do.</li>
            <li>After this product, I noticed my skin tone looked brighter and a bit more even, especially my upper lip area.</li>
            <li>It makes my face feel soft and smooth like nothing else I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although we can get something much cheaper, this product in my opinion is worth it.</li>
            <li>Thanks, Vasanti!</li>
            <li>My skin feels so smooth and soft when I use it.  </li>
            <li>I used it all up and definitely wanted more.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s literally crystals, like super fine sugar,, possibly even finer.</li>
            <li>i squeezed out a pea sized amount which was more than enough</li>
            <li>I first discovered this when given a sample of it.</li>
            <li>Within just the first week of using this product, the spots were visibly lighter.</li>
            <li>Received birchbox sample and I too instantly fell in love.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still using my first bottle that I bought a year ago</li>
            <li>but I have been using it daily to get my face into better shape.  </li>
            <li>My lotions and serums settle in faster, my skin looks brighter and more even - especially when I work out!</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I felt like there was glass on my face...</li>
            <li>At first I questioned the consistency, but after going through three bottles of the stuff now, I am a believer.</li>
            <li>instant love.  </li>
            <li>Really like this stuff!</li>
            <li>but it really seems to even out skin tone and makeup goes on like a dream after this!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff--on my second tube.</li>
            <li>I only use it about once a week even though it says you can use it more often.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what you would wish your face wash would do.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty life changing.</li>
            <li>I received it as a sample on my Birchbox a few months ago and loved what it did to my skin.  </li>
            <li>If was not specific, such as the toner I use, then I may be switching that particular product around with something else; I can&#x27;t recommend a great product...</li>
            <li>I love the smell of it, but I pretty much guarantee, when the sample is used up, I&#x27;ll be back to Vasanti.</li>
            <li>My skin looks and feels so clean, soft and radiant afterward.</li>
            <li>This stuff makes my skin feel so clean, and so soft.  </li>
            <li>You can be more gentle with it for a lighter exfoliation or scrub for a deep exfoliation.</li>
            <li>In a recent photo of myself after I began using this, I noticed a much dewier, healthy complexion.</li>
            <li>Love using it in the summer especially when I&#x27;ve been walking around NYC all day and feel grimy as it leaves my face feeling really refreshed.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend, worth the money, and you don&#x27;t need a scrub since the microcrystals scrub for you.</li>
            <li>First got this stuff as a sample with my Birchbox and noticed a real difference in the softness and tone of my skin after using.</li>
            <li>At first i thought this scrub was too gentle for the job, but once you apply it and massage</li>
            <li>Not too gritty and easily rinses off.  </li>
            <li>i understand that at first glance this product may seem spendy, but it&#x27;s amazing and you only need a tiny amount.</li>
            <li>(I have super sensitive skin) and it really clears the grime and dirt</li>
            <li>I can get dry patches around my nose and forehead, especially if I don&#x27;t follow a good skin care routine.</li>
            <li>This has none of those bead spheres, and is most similar to an aspirin mask, with very fine gritty particles that you can actually feel exfoliate your skin!</li>
            <li>Very good customer service, I am just sorry the product did not work for me.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely plan on purchasing when I run out.  </li>
            <li>Gentle exfoliation that does not irritate my skin.  </li>
            <li>It really does make my skin seem clearer and brighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle on my skin</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen much about breakouts from this product</li>
            <li>Intense.</li>
            <li>I really like the combination of enzymes *</li>
            <li>really think this helped keep me from getting breakouts.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>My sister really likes it, though she thinks it is a bit too much and mixes it with her fav face wash.</li>
            <li>My hubby and teenage kids really enjoy it as well.</li>
            <li>well and then gently exfoliate the rest of my face.</li>
            <li>fast shipment</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>My skin feels so much smoother</li>
            <li>That was really what made me consider buying the</li>
            <li>it really helps with my skin texture, my tone, and pimples.</li>
            <li>I started breaking out because it was too much exfoliating for my skin.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s really helped my breakouts...</li>
            <li>I first saw the tube and thought it would be too small to really see if it was effective.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>Days later, I still have smooth skin and no bumps.  </li>
            <li>Really gear stuff.</li>
            <li>I gently massaged it in a circular motion and then rinsed.</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t really look at it immediately.</li>
            <li>Aluminum Oxide - Superfine crystals (NOT plastic polyethylene beads) used in microdermabrasion type treatments, are the 2nd ingredient.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cocamidopropyl Betaine - a gentle, sulfate-free cleansing agent&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Papain</li>
            <li>The exfoliation really comes from the microcrystals--</li>
            <li>Your skin is smoother, as it sloughs off old, uneven skin and leaves you with baby soft skin that really feels great.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it every day (maybe once or twice a week), it&#x27;s just too much for my skin.</li>
            <li>Really does brighten the face and helps lighten age spots.</li>
            <li>It really does leave my skin feeling clearer and softer.  </li>
            <li>When you use it, your face actually feels free of dirt and oil and refreshed.  </li>
            <li>This is the like a gentle paste that you can use a few times a week to get a nice glow.</li>
            <li>My face is often flaky and dry in spots and acne has become more of an issue as I have gotten older</li>
            <li>/&gt;A simple, effective product for those who prefer physical exfoliation (scrubs) vs. chemical exfoliation (i.e. peels).</li>
            <li>What I also love about BrightenUp - in comparison to other face washes - is the texture.  </li>
            <li>etc that doesn&#x27;t respond well to most cleansers and other products.  </li>
            <li>All of my other products work better because of it too.</li>
            <li>This product is gentle (I have pretty reactive skin, if not outright &#x27;sensitive&#x27;)</li>
            <li>Provides a deep scrubbing clean with its exfoliants.</li>
            <li>Gives me a nice little glow!</li>
            <li>Having tried my share of exfoliants, I often have a hard time finding one that is a perfect balance between exfoliating enough to be effective yet not so much to be irritating.</li>
            <li>I use it a few times a week before I go to bed and wake up with super smooth skin.</li>
            <li>My skin did become slightly red after using but it quickly went back to normal and it looked fabulous.  </li>
            <li>I definitely will be buying a full size of this and add to my routine.  </li>
            <li>The reviews are correct that the bottle isn&#x27;t full of product (I don&#x27;t know any product that actually is for that matter)</li>
            <li>Cleans my face better than any other type of exfoliating product I have tried!</li>
            <li>This is my new staple piece!</li>
            <li>I have looked high and low for a true exfoliator.</li>
            <li>My face feels amazing after i use it and the gross grimy feeling i get after a rough day at work is gone.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll pretty much try anything (and I have!), but no matter what I try, I always come back to Vasanti&#x27;s Brighten Up!</li>
            <li>This is my third or fourth time ordering it, I still love it.</li>
            <li>I initially received this product as a Birchbox sample, and ended up ordering it quickly so that I could save the sample size for traveling.  </li>
            <li>most drug store &amp;#34;scrubs&amp;#34; with their giant plastic beads that do nothing for actual scrubbing.</li>
            <li>I use it a few times a week to give my face a good, deep cleaning.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend as a exfoliant.</li>
            <li>I think the &#x27;fruit enzymes&#x27; (acid ingredient) is enough to be effective, but not enough to cause negative reactions for most users.    </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>and you may need a little more than everyone else.</li>
            <li>I realize that these results will vary from person to person, but my experience with Vasanti Brighten Up has been very positive, and I do highly recommend it if you have issues similar to mine.</li>
            <li>and it has really helped with the dark &amp;#34;mask&amp;#34; I got from pregnancy and leaves my skin extremely smooth.</li>
            <li>What I do after I engage in the scurb is let the whole thing sit on my face for 5 to 10 minutes to take advantage of the ezymatic action.</li>
            <li>I was so in love with it that I started using it everyday</li>
            <li>and I still have probably another month&#x27;s worth, and I wash my face 2 times daily.</li>
            <li>Existing breakouts healed a little more quickly when I used this, and it got rid of any issues with dry, flaky skin.</li>
            <li>You can easily get 4-6 months out of a regular sized tube, since you really only need a pea size for it to work.</li>
            <li>The super tiny micro beads reminds me of a getting a microdermabrasion and my skin looks and feels so soft after I use it.</li>
            <li>I can feel this working right away because there are actually enough crystals to do the job.</li>
            <li>right way i noticed my face felt softer, but i was nervous it was going to be red!</li>
            <li>I first noticed on the bottle that it is 99% natural - and is sulfate and paraben free, and uses coconut, aloe, papaya and other natural ingredients to provide its scrubbing action.</li>
            <li>But they have outdone themselves with their new skin care line.  </li>
            <li>I feel like a new woman.</li>
            <li>not only was my face NOT red, it was a normal color and texture, for the first time in almost a decade!!  </li>
            <li>I turn very red, and I can tell this does an amazing, EVEN job because my red skin is very even, instead of patchy like it can be with other exfoliators.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin feels smoother, fine lines seem to be diminishing, and dark spots are lightening.</li>
            <li>Although I am a bit older ( 38 years old)</li>
            <li>I had &#x27;moderate acne&#x27; and it definitely changed that to &#x27;light acne&#x27; and even NO acne on some days.</li>
            <li>It has a nice smell but not overly fragrant, the grains are really small and not rough on your skin</li>
            <li>I have combination skin, more oily than dry, and I&#x27;m not very sensitive to products.</li>
            <li>The microcrystals are unlike ANY OTHER that i have even used, they&#x27;re small and rough and feel just wonderful.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and roseacea, so not a lot of products work on my skin.</li>
            <li>Also, I have combination skin that is very sensitive.</li>
            <li>While I do really like this product, the bottle is about half full when you get it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been able to use this 5 times from a small tube.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for awhile and make my skin soft and refreshed!</li>
            <li>20 minutes after the first time I used it, my skin was red</li>
            <li>The results are at least just a good as getting a professional facial, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>So far lasted a year and is still helping me achieve a glowing complexion!</li>
            <li>L&#x27;Oreal Go 360 Deep Clean, and Suki Exfoliate Foaming Cleanser (which is a close second),</li>
            <li>well, recently i was getting ready to go out with an old high school friend and wanted to get dressed up.</li>
            <li>, it gets all the dead dull skin off and reveals a beautiful soft skin afterward.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that less is more or mixing it with a regular cleanser does the trick.</li>
            <li>tiny sample that I got with Birchbox lasted me more than a month, so this size would last a long time!</li>
            <li>I love the consistency, and you only need a little bit.</li>
            <li>I have dark under eye circles and mild darkness above my upper lip (mild mustache shadow but no hair).</li>
            <li>but I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really notice a big difference using this</li>
            <li>I found that this one was gentle enough for me and cleared up a lot of my clogged pores.</li>
            <li>I have somewhat sensitive skin, and this product doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li>So I guess I&#x27;d recommend avoiding the product if you have overly sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>My skin is softer, brighter, and the stubborn blackheads on my nose are nearly gone.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so soft immediately after use, it&#x27;s not a &amp;#</li>
            <li>one told me not to use it for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>My skin is extremely sensitive and using this every 2-3 days has not irritated my skin (the package says to use 3-5 times a week).</li>
            <li>but, it&#x27;s also incredibly sensitive...</li>
            <li>my skin is also always very read, like i&#x27;m blushing constantly!</li>
            <li>and i scrubbed it on gently in circular motions as it said to, left it on a bit and washed it off.</li>
            <li>You do not have to use a lot, and I use about 2-3 times a week because I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my wife, so I cannot really talk from personal experience, but my wife loves it.</li>
            <li>It also has NOT dried out my skin at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  5/7/15</li>
            <li>This is a grainy but soft exfoliator that is supposed to brighten your skin.</li>
            <li>Leaves my face feeling soft and refreshed.</li>
            <li>alive?  </li>
            <li>you really feel the tiny crystals scrubbing.  </li>
            <li>After two minutes of scrubbing i left it on for a few more.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I might also note, that my skin gets easily irritated by beta hydroxy products (like salicyclic acid), which are the usual line of defense for clogged pores, blackheads, etc.  </li>
            <li>It removes the dead skin and leaves your face moisturized and clean feeling.</li>
            <li>I have searched for long to find the right exfoliant for my face and have tried a variety of different products</li>
            <li>so it ends up being very inexpensive in the long run.</li>
            <li>They end up being flushed down the drain, most the time, which is why it is being banned in a lot of cities due to the footprint they leave.</li>
            <li>, the price may be higher than your typical drugstore brands, but this is an adult product, and it lasts forever!</li>
            <li>Another method that I occasionally use is to mix ground nutmeg with a tiny bit of whole milk / cream and use that to exfoliate once or twice a week.</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that it&#x27;s very coarse and abrasive if you use too much.</li>
            <li>It has a thick, concentrated consistency which makes it easy to use.</li>
            <li>I grabbed a mirror and was further amazed to see clear, healthy-looking skin!  </li>
            <li>The regular size may cost more than I usually would pay but it will last awhile.</li>
            <li>, got everything unclogged, and worked off a bit of rough skin from where I picked at it previously (sorry, TMI, but it&#x27;s true), making everything look better.  </li>
            <li>It makes your face feel super soft only issue I had was it looked a little damaged.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll also know pretty quickly if that&#x27;s going to happen, I mean I&#x27;m usually still finishing my skin care routine, and that gives me plenty of time to combat the pimples right when they show up.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin super smooth and soft without being crazy abrasive.</li>
            <li>I have used other exfoliants in the past including St. Ives Apricot scrub, Olay Fresh Effects, Neutrogena Deep Clean,</li>
            <li>/&gt;This made my face feel soft as butter and brightened and toned my skin - all without the least bit of irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am gladly purchasing the full sized product; which I expect will last a while, since you only need use a small amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Next, I used my Olay Professional ProX exfoliating renewal cleanser with my Olay spin brush.</li>
            <li>Lastly, I dab my Nivea Soft moisturizing creme for face, body and hands and massage it all over my face and apply an under-eye cream.</li>
            <li>Moreover, I have sensitive skin, and it&#x27;s never made me red or irritated.  </li>
            <li>but I use it daily and have no problem on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product for everyday use if you have normal skin because it will probably be too much.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is expensive but Boots, Nivea, and Neutrogena all make cheaper products that are just as effective.</li>
            <li>so, most products make that even worse.</li>
            <li>If you peek your eye through the hole when you first open up the package, about 1/3 of the bottle is empty space!</li>
            <li>Removes dead skin effectively without irritating my VERY sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>My skin had a much more noticeable glow after about the first week and my dark spots have started to fade over the past few weeks.</li>
            <li>This is the only exfoliant that has really been gentle enough I don&#x27;t feel raw afterward, but can definitely feel it working and see that my acne is improving.</li>
            <li>I use a little more than it recommends (\\&quot;pea-shaped\\&quot; amount, says Birchbox, but I use about 2 peas) but this size will still last for a few months.    </li>
            <li>My usual skin care routine consists of first washing my face with an all natural facial cleanser, so moisten the face and start to break up the dirt and oil build up on my face (makeup as well).</li>
            <li>have sensitive combination acne-prone skin (super fun, in other words) and this stuff takes off the dry skin without irritating or feeling too abrasive.</li>
            <li>Only down fall is the bottle comes half full.</li>
            <li>You really just need a little dollop to do the job as well</li>

            <li> It smells amazing and feels divine.</li>
            <li> You can feel it effectively exfoliating (scratchy feeling) the face.</li>

            <li> Worth EVERY penny!!!</li>
            <li> Perfect for my 53 yr old skin!</li>

            <li> Works best if skin is damp, not wet.</li>
            <li> After using it the first time, my skin felt great.</li>
            <li> In general, this has been the best anti-acne step I&#x27;ve used EVER!</li>
            <li> I loved it and immediately purchased the full sized product.</li>
            <li> The consistency is more like very fine salt or sugar - not as course as sand.    </li>
            <li> I have never seen it before, so I had to search Amazon to get more, when my sample ran out.  </li>
            <li> most is that it does not over-exfoliate.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really gentle and skin feels great afterwards.  </li>
            <li> it isnt my favorite</li>
            <li> but it mostly god the job done.</li>

            <li> Great exfoliant yet gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li> oh boy is this face wash magical.</li>
            <li> it has a lovely texture, nothing like what you think when you picture exfoliation...</li>

            <li> Originally got this as a sample in my Birchbox -- LOVE it.</li>
            <li> Tried a sampler that came in my birch box and had to buy the full size bottle once I ran out!</li>
            <li> but NOOO hesitation on buying a full size!</li>
            <li> YES THEY ARE ALL TRUE!</li>
            <li> I love how easy it is to use, and how fresh it makes my face feel!</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need much, I don&#x27;t notice any change in my skin tone and honestly I use so many products I wouldn&#x27;t realize if this did anything but exfoliate or not.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a wrinkle reducer but is a very gentle, yet effective exfoliant.  </li>
            <li> I thought I would give this a try even though anything with &amp;#34;exfoliate&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;peel&amp;#34; in the description scares me to death because my ultra fair skin is very sensitive.  </li>
            <li> Love the packaging, too; easy to store in the shower and get out just the right amount of product.</li>
            <li> love love love this product - makes my face super soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I started buying the product, I saw a huge difference.</li>
            <li> My skin is more radiant, and rarely ever gets flaky.  </li>
            <li> great size package should last awhile.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fantastic .</li>
            <li> This is worth every penny and more.</li>
            <li> Smooth and renewed.</li>
            <li> etc- allows for the &amp;#34;slip&amp;#34; and smooth texture, acts as emulsifier to bind the scrub together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> b/c the scrub is so effective and gentle --</li>
            <li> This is such a great face cleanser.</li>
            <li> I have been on a skin care kick lately making this item a perfect fit!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a good facial cleanser and use organic lotions/body washes (that I LOVE)</li>
            <li> It smells nice, it feels great on my skin and the exfoliating crystals are not too harsh.</li>
            <li> My skin feel sop good after using it and it also helped clear my skin up.</li>
            <li> Noticed a difference after the FIRST use!!</li>
            <li> When I wash it off, it leaves my skin feeling smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> two full bottles later I am still a happy customer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Thank you Birchbox for such an amazing find!</li>
            <li> Upon first use, I was in love with this.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> The micro-crystals: you don&#x27;t feel them on your hands or fingers, but they feel sharp on your face (in a good way!).</li>
            <li> Originally got the sample through Birch Box, and it changed my life.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s soooo worth it!</li>
            <li> I received this originally in a subscription bag for beauty products.</li>
            <li> I know the terms &amp;#34;gentle&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;effective exfoliant&amp;#34; sound mutually exclusive, the both are true.</li>
            <li> Like many reviewers, I first learned about this product through Birchbox, which gave me a 20g sample size.</li>
            <li> I originally received this as a sample in a Birchbox...</li>
            <li> /&gt;This rinses off cleanly and doesn&#x27;t leave residue or clog pores.</li>
            <li> I clean my forehead, nose, and chin</li>
            <li> By far the best facial scrub out there!</li>
            <li> and it rinses clean.</li>
            <li> Instantly fell in love and ran out and purchased it.&lt;br /&gt;It feels so amazing while using it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely a rougher and probably more effective exfoliation.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels so clean after cleansing.</li>
            <li> Ive spent most of my post adolescent years searching for a good exfoliant.</li>
            <li> I got a sample via Birch Box and used it with my clarisonic - the results were amazing and my skin felt brighter and very soft.  </li>
            <li> One recommendation that I have is to use this on clean skin as it truly is a brightener, not a face wash; it is not meant to remove a full face of makeup.</li>
            <li> A nice, gentle fine scrub on the face versus large apricot pits digging at your skin.</li>
            <li> Skin always feels amazing and soft after use.</li>
            <li> My face is always bright red for a while after washing</li>
            <li> Love this, can really tell the difference in my complexion and the feel of my face</li>
            <li> I received a sample size in one of my monthly beauty bags and immediately purchased the full size.  </li>
            <li> This is my absolute favorite birch box sample of all time.</li>
            <li> I knew I had to have the full size bottle.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a gentle exfoliator unlike so many exfoliators I&#x27;ve tried that were abrasive and irritated my skin.  </li>
            <li> Received a sample of this and HAD to buy the full size.</li>
            <li> Skin is already &amp;#34;calm&amp;#34; and cool.</li>
            <li> full size.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It came on time and it was full.</li>
            <li> , I got a sample in my birchbox and I decided I needed a full size.</li>
            <li> The reason I don&#x27;t give 5 stars is because it is not as full as it looks.</li>
            <li> I will be ordering full size.  </li>
            <li> a true &amp;#34;polish&amp;#34</li>
            <li> So I had to have the full product.  </li>
            <li> A true holy grail for me</li>
            <li> My skin looks good and i even noticed red acne marks reduced.</li>
            <li> I HAD to order the full size.</li>
            <li> When cleansing your face make sure you are using adequate water and use a gentle circular motion on your face.</li>
            <li> That is because I have experimented and tried MANY skin care products, due to my condition, and those specific products work best for me.</li>
            <li> But other than that, a great product.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s great for other parts of the body</li>
            <li> Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t irritating and leaves my skin feeling so smooth and flawless.</li>
            <li> I would recommend to anyone for a mild exfoliant.</li>
            <li> Very gentle to my skin while leaving it smooth.</li>
            <li> After the very first use, I knew this item was for me.</li>
            <li> but I felt the price for the amount of product I got (about 2/3 of a bottle) was fair considering how long it lasts.</li>
            <li> i like it and its pretty nice for being 99% natural.</li>
            <li> Occasionally I&#x27;ll use it with my clarisonic, but I think it&#x27;s better just to use your hands over your face for the recommended 2-3 minutes, because the product will disappear into the clarisonic&#x27;s brush pretty quickly - clarisonic better with foaming soaps for that reason.    </li>
            <li> I very rarely purchase the full size of anything because I don&#x27;t like to spend too much money on these types of products, but this is one I would make an exception for.</li>
            <li> I usually do not care for enzymatic products but love this one.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re sensitive to the scratchy feeling some exfoliating can cause this product may not be very comfortable.</li>
            <li> I recently tried out their BrightenUp face wash and it is AMAZING.  </li>
            <li> Keeps my skin feeling very silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> people have had success with this product.</li>
            <li> (Someone with more sensitive skin might want to hold it at the three minute mark.)</li>
            <li> I rarely have breakouts and</li>
            <li> and so always when I run out of something fabulous, I check Amazon and sure enough - Amazon has it!  </li>
            <li> Skin feels fresh and clean.&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;m</li>
            <li> glad i don&#x27;t have sensitive skin though.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> His skin is much more sensitive to products than mine.</li>
            <li> I think it is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Bought my own and never looked back.</li>
            <li> This was a bit of a splurge, but it&#x27;s been worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> The investment has proved well worth it, as the tube has lasted me 9 months (and counting).</li>
            <li> My moisturizer was almost instantly absorbed after cleansing with this scrub.</li>
            <li> After washing with this nightly for a week my skin was visibly more clear.</li>
            <li> I find it works best by first wetting your face, then dispersing a small amount on your hand and then applying in gentle circular motions to your face and neck.  </li>
            <li> Very fine sand like feel but not rough on skin.</li>
            <li> I received it as a sample from Birchbox, and got hooked pretty quick.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really do amazon reviews, but this is seriously THE BEST bargain for an exfoliator.  </li>
            <li> It is great for a quick exfoliating scrub, or you can leave it on like a mask for a few extra minutes and let the enzymes do their thing for even better results.</li>
            <li> The enzyme results aren&#x27;t quite as noticeable right away, but do show up over time, I think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I returned the product to the company and the honored my refund right away.</li>
            <li> I usually use Dr. Lancer&#x27;s face scrub, but this is finer and even more effective.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to use, no noticeable smell, and does not irritate my very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have found that exfoliation is great for breakout avoidance, in general, and this is probably one of my favorite exfoliators (and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of them in the past</li>
            <li> A good face wash is hard to find and this stuff is seriously the best.</li>
            <li> This is a great daily facial scrub!</li>
            <li> But trust me, it is definitely worth it, works much better than commercial scrubs.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely loved it because it had little scrubbing bits in it</li>
            <li> It makes your face feel baby soft, even after the very first use!</li>
            <li> I love how tiny micro-crystals are.</li>
            <li> I feel like this is the extra boost my skin needs to look fabulous for summer!</li>
            <li> I first sampled this product when I received it in a BirchBox subscription.</li>
            <li> I could notice a difference after the first use.</li>
            <li> NOT the same product that I bought from another (apparently more legitimate) retailer.  </li>
            <li> This stuff FINALLY provided the results I&#x27;ve wanted to see for so many years.  </li>
            <li> it is magic to your face, it clears up your skin almost instantly.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what is says it will do.</li>
            <li> After this product, I noticed my skin tone looked brighter and a bit more even, especially my upper lip area.</li>
            <li> It makes my face feel soft and smooth like nothing else I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although we can get something much cheaper, this product in my opinion is worth it.</li>
            <li> Thanks, Vasanti!</li>
            <li> My skin feels so smooth and soft when I use it.  </li>
            <li> I used it all up and definitely wanted more.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s literally crystals, like super fine sugar,, possibly even finer.</li>
            <li> i squeezed out a pea sized amount which was more than enough</li>
            <li> I first discovered this when given a sample of it.</li>
            <li> Within just the first week of using this product, the spots were visibly lighter.</li>
            <li> Received birchbox sample and I too instantly fell in love.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still using my first bottle that I bought a year ago</li>
            <li> but I have been using it daily to get my face into better shape.  </li>
            <li> My lotions and serums settle in faster, my skin looks brighter and more even - especially when I work out!</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I felt like there was glass on my face...</li>
            <li> At first I questioned the consistency, but after going through three bottles of the stuff now, I am a believer.</li>
            <li> instant love.  </li>
            <li> Really like this stuff!</li>
            <li> but it really seems to even out skin tone and makeup goes on like a dream after this!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff--on my second tube.</li>
            <li> I only use it about once a week even though it says you can use it more often.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what you would wish your face wash would do.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty life changing.</li>
            <li> I received it as a sample on my Birchbox a few months ago and loved what it did to my skin.  </li>
            <li> If was not specific, such as the toner I use, then I may be switching that particular product around with something else; I can&#x27;t recommend a great product...</li>
            <li> I love the smell of it, but I pretty much guarantee, when the sample is used up, I&#x27;ll be back to Vasanti.</li>
            <li> My skin looks and feels so clean, soft and radiant afterward.</li>
            <li> This stuff makes my skin feel so clean, and so soft.  </li>
            <li> You can be more gentle with it for a lighter exfoliation or scrub for a deep exfoliation.</li>
            <li> In a recent photo of myself after I began using this, I noticed a much dewier, healthy complexion.</li>
            <li> Love using it in the summer especially when I&#x27;ve been walking around NYC all day and feel grimy as it leaves my face feeling really refreshed.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend, worth the money, and you don&#x27;t need a scrub since the microcrystals scrub for you.</li>
            <li> First got this stuff as a sample with my Birchbox and noticed a real difference in the softness and tone of my skin after using.</li>
            <li> At first i thought this scrub was too gentle for the job, but once you apply it and massage</li>
            <li> Not too gritty and easily rinses off.  </li>
            <li> i understand that at first glance this product may seem spendy, but it&#x27;s amazing and you only need a tiny amount.</li>
            <li> (I have super sensitive skin) and it really clears the grime and dirt</li>
            <li> I can get dry patches around my nose and forehead, especially if I don&#x27;t follow a good skin care routine.</li>
            <li> This has none of those bead spheres, and is most similar to an aspirin mask, with very fine gritty particles that you can actually feel exfoliate your skin!</li>
            <li> Very good customer service, I am just sorry the product did not work for me.</li>
            <li> and I absolutely plan on purchasing when I run out.  </li>
            <li> Gentle exfoliation that does not irritate my skin.  </li>
            <li> It really does make my skin seem clearer and brighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle on my skin</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen much about breakouts from this product</li>
            <li> Intense.</li>
            <li> I really like the combination of enzymes *</li>
            <li> really think this helped keep me from getting breakouts.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> My sister really likes it, though she thinks it is a bit too much and mixes it with her fav face wash.</li>
            <li> My hubby and teenage kids really enjoy it as well.</li>
            <li> well and then gently exfoliate the rest of my face.</li>
            <li> fast shipment</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> My skin feels so much smoother</li>
            <li> That was really what made me consider buying the</li>
            <li> it really helps with my skin texture, my tone, and pimples.</li>
            <li> I started breaking out because it was too much exfoliating for my skin.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s really helped my breakouts...</li>
            <li> I first saw the tube and thought it would be too small to really see if it was effective.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> Days later, I still have smooth skin and no bumps.  </li>
            <li> Really gear stuff.</li>
            <li> I gently massaged it in a circular motion and then rinsed.</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t really look at it immediately.</li>
            <li> Aluminum Oxide - Superfine crystals (NOT plastic polyethylene beads) used in microdermabrasion type treatments, are the 2nd ingredient.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cocamidopropyl Betaine - a gentle, sulfate-free cleansing agent&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Papain</li>
            <li> The exfoliation really comes from the microcrystals--</li>
            <li> Your skin is smoother, as it sloughs off old, uneven skin and leaves you with baby soft skin that really feels great.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it every day (maybe once or twice a week), it&#x27;s just too much for my skin.</li>
            <li> Really does brighten the face and helps lighten age spots.</li>
            <li> It really does leave my skin feeling clearer and softer.  </li>
            <li> When you use it, your face actually feels free of dirt and oil and refreshed.  </li>
            <li> This is the like a gentle paste that you can use a few times a week to get a nice glow.</li>
            <li> My face is often flaky and dry in spots and acne has become more of an issue as I have gotten older</li>
            <li> /&gt;A simple, effective product for those who prefer physical exfoliation (scrubs) vs. chemical exfoliation (i.e. peels).</li>
            <li> What I also love about BrightenUp - in comparison to other face washes - is the texture.  </li>
            <li> etc that doesn&#x27;t respond well to most cleansers and other products.  </li>
            <li> All of my other products work better because of it too.</li>
            <li> This product is gentle (I have pretty reactive skin, if not outright &#x27;sensitive&#x27;)</li>
            <li> Provides a deep scrubbing clean with its exfoliants.</li>
            <li> Gives me a nice little glow!</li>
            <li> Having tried my share of exfoliants, I often have a hard time finding one that is a perfect balance between exfoliating enough to be effective yet not so much to be irritating.</li>
            <li> I use it a few times a week before I go to bed and wake up with super smooth skin.</li>
            <li> My skin did become slightly red after using but it quickly went back to normal and it looked fabulous.  </li>
            <li> I definitely will be buying a full size of this and add to my routine.  </li>
            <li> The reviews are correct that the bottle isn&#x27;t full of product (I don&#x27;t know any product that actually is for that matter)</li>
            <li> Cleans my face better than any other type of exfoliating product I have tried!</li>
            <li> This is my new staple piece!</li>
            <li> I have looked high and low for a true exfoliator.</li>
            <li> My face feels amazing after i use it and the gross grimy feeling i get after a rough day at work is gone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll pretty much try anything (and I have!), but no matter what I try, I always come back to Vasanti&#x27;s Brighten Up!</li>
            <li> This is my third or fourth time ordering it, I still love it.</li>
            <li> I initially received this product as a Birchbox sample, and ended up ordering it quickly so that I could save the sample size for traveling.  </li>
            <li> most drug store &amp;#34;scrubs&amp;#34; with their giant plastic beads that do nothing for actual scrubbing.</li>
            <li> I use it a few times a week to give my face a good, deep cleaning.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend as a exfoliant.</li>
            <li> I think the &#x27;fruit enzymes&#x27; (acid ingredient) is enough to be effective, but not enough to cause negative reactions for most users.    </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> and you may need a little more than everyone else.</li>
            <li> I realize that these results will vary from person to person, but my experience with Vasanti Brighten Up has been very positive, and I do highly recommend it if you have issues similar to mine.</li>
            <li> and it has really helped with the dark &amp;#34;mask&amp;#34; I got from pregnancy and leaves my skin extremely smooth.</li>
            <li> What I do after I engage in the scurb is let the whole thing sit on my face for 5 to 10 minutes to take advantage of the ezymatic action.</li>
            <li> I was so in love with it that I started using it everyday</li>
            <li> and I still have probably another month&#x27;s worth, and I wash my face 2 times daily.</li>
            <li> Existing breakouts healed a little more quickly when I used this, and it got rid of any issues with dry, flaky skin.</li>
            <li> You can easily get 4-6 months out of a regular sized tube, since you really only need a pea size for it to work.</li>
            <li> The super tiny micro beads reminds me of a getting a microdermabrasion and my skin looks and feels so soft after I use it.</li>
            <li> I can feel this working right away because there are actually enough crystals to do the job.</li>
            <li> right way i noticed my face felt softer, but i was nervous it was going to be red!</li>
            <li> I first noticed on the bottle that it is 99% natural - and is sulfate and paraben free, and uses coconut, aloe, papaya and other natural ingredients to provide its scrubbing action.</li>
            <li> But they have outdone themselves with their new skin care line.  </li>
            <li> I feel like a new woman.</li>
            <li> not only was my face NOT red, it was a normal color and texture, for the first time in almost a decade!!  </li>
            <li> I turn very red, and I can tell this does an amazing, EVEN job because my red skin is very even, instead of patchy like it can be with other exfoliators.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin feels smoother, fine lines seem to be diminishing, and dark spots are lightening.</li>
            <li> Although I am a bit older ( 38 years old)</li>
            <li> I had &#x27;moderate acne&#x27; and it definitely changed that to &#x27;light acne&#x27; and even NO acne on some days.</li>
            <li> It has a nice smell but not overly fragrant, the grains are really small and not rough on your skin</li>
            <li> I have combination skin, more oily than dry, and I&#x27;m not very sensitive to products.</li>
            <li> The microcrystals are unlike ANY OTHER that i have even used, they&#x27;re small and rough and feel just wonderful.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and roseacea, so not a lot of products work on my skin.</li>
            <li> Also, I have combination skin that is very sensitive.</li>
            <li> While I do really like this product, the bottle is about half full when you get it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been able to use this 5 times from a small tube.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for awhile and make my skin soft and refreshed!</li>
            <li> 20 minutes after the first time I used it, my skin was red</li>
            <li> The results are at least just a good as getting a professional facial, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> So far lasted a year and is still helping me achieve a glowing complexion!</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal Go 360 Deep Clean, and Suki Exfoliate Foaming Cleanser (which is a close second),</li>
            <li> well, recently i was getting ready to go out with an old high school friend and wanted to get dressed up.</li>
            <li> , it gets all the dead dull skin off and reveals a beautiful soft skin afterward.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that less is more or mixing it with a regular cleanser does the trick.</li>
            <li> tiny sample that I got with Birchbox lasted me more than a month, so this size would last a long time!</li>
            <li> I love the consistency, and you only need a little bit.</li>
            <li> I have dark under eye circles and mild darkness above my upper lip (mild mustache shadow but no hair).</li>
            <li> but I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really notice a big difference using this</li>
            <li> I found that this one was gentle enough for me and cleared up a lot of my clogged pores.</li>
            <li> I have somewhat sensitive skin, and this product doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> So I guess I&#x27;d recommend avoiding the product if you have overly sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My skin is softer, brighter, and the stubborn blackheads on my nose are nearly gone.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so soft immediately after use, it&#x27;s not a &amp;#</li>
            <li> one told me not to use it for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My skin is extremely sensitive and using this every 2-3 days has not irritated my skin (the package says to use 3-5 times a week).</li>
            <li> but, it&#x27;s also incredibly sensitive...</li>
            <li> my skin is also always very read, like i&#x27;m blushing constantly!</li>
            <li> and i scrubbed it on gently in circular motions as it said to, left it on a bit and washed it off.</li>
            <li> You do not have to use a lot, and I use about 2-3 times a week because I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife, so I cannot really talk from personal experience, but my wife loves it.</li>
            <li> It also has NOT dried out my skin at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  5/7/15</li>
            <li> This is a grainy but soft exfoliator that is supposed to brighten your skin.</li>
            <li> Leaves my face feeling soft and refreshed.</li>
            <li> alive?  </li>
            <li> you really feel the tiny crystals scrubbing.  </li>
            <li> After two minutes of scrubbing i left it on for a few more.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I might also note, that my skin gets easily irritated by beta hydroxy products (like salicyclic acid), which are the usual line of defense for clogged pores, blackheads, etc.  </li>
            <li> It removes the dead skin and leaves your face moisturized and clean feeling.</li>
            <li> I have searched for long to find the right exfoliant for my face and have tried a variety of different products</li>
            <li> so it ends up being very inexpensive in the long run.</li>
            <li> They end up being flushed down the drain, most the time, which is why it is being banned in a lot of cities due to the footprint they leave.</li>
            <li> , the price may be higher than your typical drugstore brands, but this is an adult product, and it lasts forever!</li>
            <li> Another method that I occasionally use is to mix ground nutmeg with a tiny bit of whole milk / cream and use that to exfoliate once or twice a week.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that it&#x27;s very coarse and abrasive if you use too much.</li>
            <li> It has a thick, concentrated consistency which makes it easy to use.</li>
            <li> I grabbed a mirror and was further amazed to see clear, healthy-looking skin!  </li>
            <li> The regular size may cost more than I usually would pay but it will last awhile.</li>
            <li> , got everything unclogged, and worked off a bit of rough skin from where I picked at it previously (sorry, TMI, but it&#x27;s true), making everything look better.  </li>
            <li> It makes your face feel super soft only issue I had was it looked a little damaged.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll also know pretty quickly if that&#x27;s going to happen, I mean I&#x27;m usually still finishing my skin care routine, and that gives me plenty of time to combat the pimples right when they show up.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin super smooth and soft without being crazy abrasive.</li>
            <li> I have used other exfoliants in the past including St. Ives Apricot scrub, Olay Fresh Effects, Neutrogena Deep Clean,</li>
            <li> /&gt;This made my face feel soft as butter and brightened and toned my skin - all without the least bit of irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am gladly purchasing the full sized product; which I expect will last a while, since you only need use a small amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Next, I used my Olay Professional ProX exfoliating renewal cleanser with my Olay spin brush.</li>
            <li> Lastly, I dab my Nivea Soft moisturizing creme for face, body and hands and massage it all over my face and apply an under-eye cream.</li>
            <li> Moreover, I have sensitive skin, and it&#x27;s never made me red or irritated.  </li>
            <li> but I use it daily and have no problem on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product for everyday use if you have normal skin because it will probably be too much.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is expensive but Boots, Nivea, and Neutrogena all make cheaper products that are just as effective.</li>
            <li> so, most products make that even worse.</li>
            <li> If you peek your eye through the hole when you first open up the package, about 1/3 of the bottle is empty space!</li>
            <li> Removes dead skin effectively without irritating my VERY sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My skin had a much more noticeable glow after about the first week and my dark spots have started to fade over the past few weeks.</li>
            <li> This is the only exfoliant that has really been gentle enough I don&#x27;t feel raw afterward, but can definitely feel it working and see that my acne is improving.</li>
            <li> I use a little more than it recommends (\\&quot;pea-shaped\\&quot; amount, says Birchbox, but I use about 2 peas) but this size will still last for a few months.    </li>
            <li> My usual skin care routine consists of first washing my face with an all natural facial cleanser, so moisten the face and start to break up the dirt and oil build up on my face (makeup as well).</li>
            <li> have sensitive combination acne-prone skin (super fun, in other words) and this stuff takes off the dry skin without irritating or feeling too abrasive.</li>
            <li> Only down fall is the bottle comes half full.</li>
            <li> You really just need a little dollop to do the job as well</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin, use in the shower or fully wet your face and hands before using and that should help!</li>
            <li> So this big bottle will last you a long time.</li>
            <li> I have always struggled with overly sensitive, bad skin, I have tried everything you can think of and spent a ton of money trying to get clear, healthy skin and never succeeded.  </li>
            <li> I use it a few times a week and follow it up by using a high quality moisturizer from Kiehls, to prevent dryness.</li>
            <li> I used this for the first time this week on dry skin, whereas I usually use it in the shower.  </li>
            <li> All you need is a small dab of it and you can wash your whole face.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time for me, and I alternate with La Roche Posay&#x27;s Toleriane.</li>
            <li> It will last a long time.</li>
            <li> My skin type is mixed by the way, oily t zone, dry cheeks.</li>
            <li> The product is thick so a small amount goes a long way; cleanses well and washes off easily.</li>
            <li> I cannot stand a scrub that has dissolving bits or little pieces of things that are so soft they don&#x27;t even scrub your skin.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s literally scaly and flaking as though it was awful dandruff, it&#x27;s incredibly embarrassing.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> somewhere in the distant future...</li>
            <li> so it lasts quite a long time.</li>
            <li> I had never really bothered exfoliating regularly before I used this -</li>
            <li> ; for your face, erasing all dead skin cells, leaving your skin baby soft and crystal clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A pea-sized amount goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I have fairly sensitive skin, and this is one of the few face washes that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  </li>
            <li> I did notice, once I started doing that, that I had some minor breakouts.</li>
            <li> For instance, I bought my current bottle at the end of July, and still have well over half of the bottle left</li>
            <li> It has no strong odor and no harsh cleansers.</li>
            <li> Although it seems a bit pricey when compared to regular face washes you can buy at the drug store, you only need to use a small amount of product each time you wash your face, and only need to use it 3 or 4 times a week, so it lasts a really long time.</li>
            <li> First of all the small little trial sample I had lasted me quite awhile</li>
            <li> A lot of other exfoliators (even milder ones) say to only use 2 or 3 times.</li>
            <li> Expensive, but worth it!</li>
            <li> I received a sample in my birchbox last month and used it every other day until i ran out.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out.</li>
            <li> Because my skin is generally dry</li>
            <li> Works like a charm when I have dry flaky skin.</li>
            <li> i got out, patted my face dry and looked in the mirror.</li>
            <li> and I over-exfoliate and end up with dry patches of skin on my face.</li>
            <li> Cleanses, exfoliates, and rinses clean, but not too harsh or irritating.</li>
            <li> i gave out little samples of it to the ladies in my family, so the sample didn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> It only takes a very small amount, so it should last several months.</li>
            <li> So just remember when you get it, it is only half.</li>
            <li> There was no burning or stinging and just a slight gritty feeling to the product.</li>
            <li> the amount is negligible, and next to the preservative, it&#x27;s probably less than 1%.</li>
            <li> due to MS and the drugs i take for that and extremely dry skin to begin with, my face is always so dry</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheaper but of course takes a little extra preparation.</li>
            <li> I received it in my Birchbox a few months back and literally cried when I finished the sample.</li>
            <li> I was still getting pimples, and I was starting to get freckles, it seemed like my skin had uneven</li>
            <li> It removes all the dead skin cells that are sloughed off daily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never really had acne per se, just a tendency for clogged pores/blackheads/</li>
            <li> There is just enough exfoliant in it to buff the skin without being harsh.</li>
            <li> Goodbye to my OTC green &amp; white tube.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed a decrease in pore size, elimination of all blackheads and rough patches.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The rest of the ingredients are minimal and added in for marketing purposes (Aloe, Vit E, Castor Seed Oil).</li>
            <li> But they&#x27;re not really needed</li>
            <li> , I would not have spent the $ on this.  </li>
            <li> My face has had some breakouts since use, but I expected that to occur.  </li>
            <li> I am in my early 40&#x27;s, and have noticed some dark blotchy areas showing up on my cheeks which is evidently common for women my age.</li>
            <li> I have already noticed less flaky, dry skin and the acne</li>
            <li> It can be too rough if you overuse it, and that can lead to some small pimples, but I&#x27;ve never had it cause any big breakouts if I&#x27;m using it correctly.</li>
            <li> but because I had sampled the product before I knew that a little goes a LONG way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t tight, too dry or blotchy.</li>
            <li> I used other exfoliators and they did nothing.</li>
            <li> and I use it every other day.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way too!  </li>
            <li> I use it every other day.  </li>
            <li> Only thing I use now and have been using for the past year.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, so it lasts forever!</li>
            <li> would say to use one or the other.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also not filmy like other face washes.  </li>
            <li> I went back to what the directions said and had no more problems.</li>
            <li> i have extremely problematic skin..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty expensive-</li>
            <li> (&#x27;Tho you shouldn&#x27;t use this as an eye makeup remover due to the crystals)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> use this about every other day.  </li>
            <li> I use this every other day</li>
            <li> I little bit goes a very long way</li>
            <li> That works, but it&#x27;s not great for my skin and leaves it pretty raw.    </li>
            <li> The grains in the scrub are not super rough and abrasive.  </li>
            <li> that disappears after a few days when I use alcohol to dry it out!  </li>
            <li> It may be a little pricier, but since a little goes a long way, I look at this splurge as an investment.  </li>
            <li> A small amount goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> and  so much better than this crap.</li>
            <li> Again, I am very leery of trying new stuff because I hate wasting money and then accumulating tons of meh products.  </li>
            <li> This is one of those products where using a &amp;#34;pea-sized&amp;#34; amount is not some silly joke to make you think that your face must somehow be larger than the average human being</li>
            <li> A little pricey but a small squeeze goes a long way!</li>
            <li> It is slightly abrasive if you use it as directed.</li>
            <li> Plus, I have significantly less blackheads and bumps when this is part of my regimen.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Makes my skin glow gets rid of black heads.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s even finer than a body sugar scrub, and way less</li>
            <li> My skin type is combination, acne prone and has slight signs of aging.</li>
            <li> I use it in the shower to curb the mess factor.  </li>
            <li> The little microbeads are so soothing and not at all harsh as some exfoliating products can be.  </li>
            <li> As a result, I had rough, dull skin that I figured would take weeks of scrubbing and moisturizing faithfully to correct.</li>
            <li> I get a few compliments on my skin and, at 52</li>
            <li> i use it every day, the scrub is not painfull or harsh it</li>
            <li> I used to be a birchbox member but got tired of paying $10 a month to be inundated with samples I likely won&#x27;t use.  </li>
            <li> I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> It was just a few cents cheaper to purchase on here rather than Birchbox.  </li>
            <li> If you leave it on for a few minutes, you get a chemical exfoliation also.</li>
            <li> I use a pea-sized amount, scrub using hands for 2 minutes, and leave it on for another few while brushing teeth.</li>
            <li> Quite a few years ago I found a microdermabrasion from Avon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ibm my late 20&#x27;s and trying harder to take care of my skin and this is the answer.</li>
            <li> (It&#x27;s not a strong or perfume-y fragrance, for what it&#x27;s</li>
            <li> A small amount goes a long way, so it&#x27;s really not too expensive in the long-run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> If you have rough, dull skin, you need to try this!  </li>
            <li> but you use very little.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not really sure if the cause.</li>
            <li> I also have an uneven skin tone, which is common with women of color (about NC 45 in MAC).</li>
            <li> I recommend applying using small circular motions and focusing on your problem areas.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even know this was possible, and without any weird irritation or ingredients</li>
            <li> and I started to get small pimples form on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> Needless to say I ordered the big size</li>
            <li> The small sample did not say to leave it on your face for an extended amount of time if you wanted to increase the enzyme effects.  </li>
            <li> Had to return this was not a good batch or black market product.</li>
            <li> I already use a clarisonic, and have used St. Ives&#x27; apricot scrub in the past, but usually if I want serious exfoliation I&#x27;ll just scrub at my face with a washcloth.  </li>
            <li> Never rub hard or you will damage your skin as with any exfoliating cleanser.</li>
            <li> It can feel scratchy, BUT that depends on how hard you rub it on your skin.  </li>
            <li> I was planning to use this product for at least a week</li>
            <li> However, when my husband tried it he complained that it &amp;#34;burned&amp;#34; his face.</li>
            <li> but lately I&#x27;ve been using it every morning with no problems whatsoever.  </li>
            <li> now I use it at least 3-4x per week.</li>
            <li> I have found that some exfoliants contain too creamy of a base so that you can&#x27;t feel the exfoliant really working on your skin.</li>
            <li> I was wary of this item due to the fact it exfoliates and</li>
            <li> There are not many products that can leave you thoroughly exfoliated and still feel moisturized!</li>
            <li> As mentioned in another review, a very small amount is needed.</li>
            <li> When comparing the size of this product with the price, it may seem a little expensive for a face wash</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only wash I could use in the beginning of my pregnancy because everything else made me sick.  </li>
            <li> One of the worse things I bought.  </li>
            <li> If you are already using an AHA or BHA then a scrub like this is unnecessary or even harmful.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> This exfoliates your skin without irritating it.</li>
            <li> I am addicted to this stuff.</li>
            <li> too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am thoroughly addicted.</li>
            <li> For 2 weeks I had to walk around with a red raw face!!!!!!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s too expensive for what you get.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it made me break</li>
            <li> The winter months are the worse!</li>
            <li> Yes that sounds weird</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost addicted to washing my face!</li>
            <li> It did feel like I was rubbing broken glass shards on my face for a few minutes, but I knew it was buffing my skin and taking all the nasty stuff with it.</li>
            <li> so I wasn&#x27;t afraid to spend $30 on an exfoliator.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t contain any artificial dyes, although it does contain fragrance.</li>
            <li> Wrong!</li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> , bad idea.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> I hate to be the one person who doesn&#x27;t like this, but I think it sucked.</li>
            <li> I hate (yes, HATE)</li>
            <li> But the worst thing is that it broke me out terribly.</li>
            <li> I was having some really awful dryness and couldn&#x27;t figure it out.</li>
            <li> nothing but terrible breakouts, swelling, and redness.</li>
            <li> I hate this product!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this, can really tell the difference in my complexion and the feel of my face</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this in my montly Birchbox.  I have never seen it before, so I had to search Amazon to get more, when my sample ran out.  This stuff is seriously awesome.  It smells good.  It exfoliates well.  What I like about it most is that it does not over-exfoliate.  It&#x27;s very gentle and perfect for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s probably the best face scrub I ever used. I love how tiny micro-crystals are. I received a sample size in one of my monthly beauty bags and immediately purchased the full size.  I used this product for longer than two months and I know this product works. Buy it and it will be your holy grail beauty product!</li>
            <li> Received as a birch box sample and instantly fell in love!!! This product is amazing!!!</li>
            <li> I have been on a skin care kick lately making this item a perfect fit!  I was wary of this item due to the fact it exfoliates and my face tends to turn very red and tender after any type of exfoliation but I was pleasantly surprised.  My skin did become slightly red after using but it quickly went back to normal and it looked fabulous.  I’m using this every 3 days as suggested by the instructions and I absolutely plan on purchasing when I run out.  I feel like this is the extra boost my skin needs to look fabulous for summer!</li>
            <li> Cleans my face better than any other type of exfoliating product I have tried! I love how easy it is to use, and how fresh it makes my face feel!</li>
            <li> Gentle exfoliation that does not irritate my skin.  A small amount goes a long way.  Refreshes and brightens my skin.</li>
            <li> While I do really like this product, the bottle is about half full when you get it and it&#x27;s too expensive for what you get.</li>
            <li> Received a product sample in my Birchbox and loved it! Lasts a long time. I use a pea sized amt once a day. Very fine grained and gentle but effective! Perfect for my 53 yr old skin!</li>
            <li> I got this as a sample in my Birchbox and I absolutely love it! A small amount goes a long way, so it&#x27;s really not too expensive in the long-run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive combination acne-prone skin (super fun, in other words) and this stuff takes off the dry skin without irritating or feeling too abrasive. Leave it on for a few minutes in the shower and the enzymes really kick in. It really does make my skin seem clearer and brighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gentle enough to use a couple times as week - it&#x27;s become part of my regular routine!</li>
            <li> This is my absolute favorite birch box sample of all time. Like others posting on here, I used my sample and had to have more! A good face wash is hard to find and this stuff is seriously the best. A little pricey but a small squeeze goes a long way! I use it a few times a week before I go to bed and wake up with super smooth skin. Love this face wash!!!</li>
            <li> I got these in a birchbox sample and absolutely loved it.  I have searched for long to find the right exfoliant for my face and have tried a variety of different products but this one finally, finally works!  It&#x27;s gentle on my skin (I have super sensitive skin) and it really clears the grime and dirt my skin has a tendency to accumulate and hide.  It&#x27;s really gentle and skin feels great afterwards.  Buying the full size now!</li>
            <li> I first sampled this product when I received it in a BirchBox subscription. Upon first use, I was in love with this. I could notice a difference after the first use. My skin had a much more noticeable glow after about the first week and my dark spots have started to fade over the past few weeks. When comparing the size of this product with the price, it may seem a little expensive for a face wash but because I had sampled the product before I knew that a little goes a LONG way. This is one of those products where using a &amp;#34;pea-sized&amp;#34; amount is not some silly joke to make you think that your face must somehow be larger than the average human being and you may need a little more than everyone else. I will definitely purchase this product again... somewhere in the distant future... I just don&#x27;t see me reaching the end of this bottle anytime soon.</li>
            <li> i like it and its pretty nice for being 99% natural. it didnt hurt my skin. it isnt my favorite but it mostly god the job done.</li>
            <li> Great face scrub. Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really notice a big difference using this and I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month about 3 times a week. I will continue to use it but probably will not repurchase.</li>
            <li> After getting this in my birchbox or glossy box I HAD to buy it!! First of all the small little trial sample I had lasted me quite awhile so I wasn&#x27;t afraid to spend $30 on an exfoliator. You don&#x27;t need much, I don&#x27;t notice any change in my skin tone and honestly I use so many products I wouldn&#x27;t realize if this did anything but exfoliate or not.</li>
            <li> I received this product as a Birchbox sample and LOVED the idea that it was 99% organic. I&#x27;ve been looking for a good facial cleanser and use organic lotions/body washes (that I LOVE) so I hoped this would work out. Unfortunately, it made me break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most people have had success with this product. I haven&#x27;t seen much about breakouts from this product so I&#x27;m not really sure if the cause.</li>
            <li> Best stuff I&#x27;ve ever used!!</li>
            <li> Intense. Skin always feels amazing and soft after use. A dab will do ya. Works best if skin is damp, not wet.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! I received it in my Birchbox a few months back and literally cried when I finished the sample. I told everybody about how amazing it is and received 3 full size tubes for my birthday. I little bit goes a very long way so don&#x27;t be turned off by the price- it&#x27;s worth it!! I use it about 3x a week and it has really helped with the dark &amp;#34;mask&amp;#34; I got from pregnancy and leaves my skin extremely smooth. Buy this product and try for yourself!!!</li>
            <li> Originally got this as a sample in my Birchbox -- LOVE it. This is the only exfoliant that has really been gentle enough I don&#x27;t feel raw afterward, but can definitely feel it working and see that my acne is improving. Even works through my period break-out phase each month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tiny sample that I got with Birchbox lasted me more than a month, so this size would last a long time!</li>
            <li> Face masks and scrubs are among my favorite beauty products. I&#x27;ll pretty much try anything (and I have!), but no matter what I try, I always come back to Vasanti&#x27;s Brighten Up! scrub. You get the best bang for your buck with this scrub. It just works, period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face is smooth and soft, and the scrub isn&#x27;t too harsh (I like robust scrubs, but then, my skin isn&#x27;t delicate.) What I do after I engage in the scurb is let the whole thing sit on my face for 5 to 10 minutes to take advantage of the ezymatic action. (Someone with more sensitive skin might want to hold it at the three minute mark.) I then rinse and behold pristine skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right now i have a three packet sample of Glamglow&#x27;s Flashmud, which promises to brighten. I love the smell of it, but I pretty much guarantee, when the sample is used up, I&#x27;ll be back to Vasanti. It&#x27;s about the best scrub there is, all things considered.</li>
            <li> I hate to be the one person who doesn&#x27;t like this, but I think it sucked. One, it was not exfoliating, it still left me flaky. It also left a film on my skin that I couldn&#x27;t rinse off. But the worst thing is that it broke me out terribly.</li>
            <li> I use this product three times a week, and everybody comments on the smoothness of my skin.  Great results!  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Came in great time and I love it</li>
            <li> Got a sample of this from Birchbox, and fell in love with it. Still awesome, and feels like a mini-facial everytime I use it.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite exfoliators. I really like the combination of enzymes *and* microdermabrasion crystals. I also like the density of crystals. I can feel this working right away because there are actually enough crystals to do the job. The enzyme results aren&#x27;t quite as noticeable right away, but do show up over time, I think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like that this can be used up to 5 times a week. A lot of other exfoliators (even milder ones) say to only use 2 or 3 times. I feel like this one can be used enough to actually see results. Even at this rate, it did not irritate me to use this cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This rinses off cleanly and doesn&#x27;t leave residue or clog pores. It also doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out. It doesn&#x27;t contain any artificial dyes, although it does contain fragrance. (It&#x27;s not a strong or perfume-y fragrance, for what it&#x27;s worth.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really think this helped keep me from getting breakouts. I have found that exfoliation is great for breakout avoidance, in general, and this is probably one of my favorite exfoliators (and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of them in the past year).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would also say this has improved the appearance of my skin. Existing breakouts healed a little more quickly when I used this, and it got rid of any issues with dry, flaky skin.</li>
            <li> NOT the same product that I bought from another (apparently more legitimate) retailer.  Same price, but the consistency of the product is completely different.</li>
            <li> I love this product! My skin feels so smooth after just one use, it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> I am in LOVE with this product!  I initially tried it when I received the sample in my Birchbox and after using it I knew I had to have the full size bottle.  I have always struggled with overly sensitive, bad skin, I have tried everything you can think of and spent a ton of money trying to get clear, healthy skin and never succeeded.  This stuff FINALLY provided the results I&#x27;ve wanted to see for so many years.  My skin is brighter, smoother, blemish free, and feels great! It&#x27;s a gentle exfoliator unlike so many exfoliators I&#x27;ve tried that were abrasive and irritated my skin.  I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I have looked high and low for a true exfoliator. This is the like a gentle paste that you can use a few times a week to get a nice glow. It is wonderful to use at night. Wash with this product, rinse well,and put on a good night cream. I get a few compliments on my skin and, at 52, I think it&#x27;s the simple steps I use to exfoliate and moisturize that help keep aging skin at bay.</li>
            <li> I am another birchbox sample receiver. I very rarely purchase the full size of anything because I don&#x27;t like to spend too much money on these types of products, but this is one I would make an exception for. I have very sensitive skin and roseacea, so not a lot of products work on my skin. I found that this one was gentle enough for me and cleared up a lot of my clogged pores. Another method that I occasionally use is to mix ground nutmeg with a tiny bit of whole milk / cream and use that to exfoliate once or twice a week. It&#x27;s cheaper but of course takes a little extra preparation.</li>
            <li> this product is AMAZING!! it is magic to your face, it clears up your skin almost instantly. i use it every day, the scrub is not painfull or harsh it it perfect and help pimples that are growing just disappear from one day to the next.</li>
            <li> My wife swears by it. It does exactly what is says it will do.</li>
            <li> I just literally used this exfoliating cleanser and HAD to come on here and review it immediately! I was planning to use this product for at least a week but the results were so instant, it was no need to wait!!!   My usual skin care routine consists of first washing my face with an all natural facial cleanser, so moisten the face and start to break up the dirt and oil build up on my face (makeup as well). *Then, I used the Vasanti BrightenUp exfoliating cleanser all over the face, including my lips.* Next, I used my Olay Professional ProX exfoliating renewal cleanser with my Olay spin brush. Then, I used a cleansing lotion (toner) to restore the PH balance in my face from using all those products on my face. Lastly, I dab my Nivea Soft moisturizing creme for face, body and hands and massage it all over my face and apply an under-eye cream. I recommend using a sunscreen as well, when you&#x27;re planning to be in the sun.  As a reference, I suffer from a chronic illness and one of the side effects is skin dryness, including my face. The winter months are the worse! I can get dry patches around my nose and forehead, especially if I don&#x27;t follow a good skin care routine. I also have an uneven skin tone, which is common with women of color (about NC 45 in MAC). I have dark under eye circles and mild darkness above my upper lip (mild mustache shadow but no hair). Because my skin is generally dry I rarely have breakouts and if I do it&#x27;s a pimple or two that disappears after a few days when I use alcohol to dry it out!  Now about this product...AMAZING! I immediately noticed a brightening effect after I used it. I used my fingers to rub the product all over the face. You can feel it effectively exfoliating (scratchy feeling) the face. If you&#x27;re sensitive to the scratchy feeling some exfoliating can cause this product may not be very comfortable. After this product, I noticed my skin tone looked brighter and a bit more even, especially my upper lip area. I was glowing. I couldn&#x27;t believe it, after ONE use! I definitely will be buying a full size of this and add to my routine.  Disclaimer: I specifically named some products and brands I use during my skin care routine. That is because I have experimented and tried MANY skin care products, due to my condition, and those specific products work best for me. If was not specific, such as the toner I use, then I may be switching that particular product around with something else; I can&#x27;t recommend a great product...everything mentioned was bought with my own money or included in another subscription box I paid for. Nothing was given to me for free to endorse or review and all opinions expressed are my own and I hope will help others as it has helped me!</li>
            <li> I received a sample size in my Birchbox and was hooked from the moment I used it. People have commented on how glowing my skin looks. I was having some really awful dryness and couldn&#x27;t figure it out. I used other exfoliators and they did nothing. This one is a cleanser/exfoliator and I use it every other day. In between days I use Garnier&#x27;s facial oil cleanser. So after using Vasanti for a week I noticed a difference. And now 4 weeks in my skin dryness is totally gone. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product. A little goes a long way too!  Also I&#x27;m 41 and this has helped with the skin dullness that comes with age.</li>
            <li> I got this in my Birch Box and instantly loved it! I love the amount of exfoliating ingredient that is in this product! It is like scrubbing your face with sand --in a GOOD way! You can be more gentle with it for a lighter exfoliation or scrub for a deep exfoliation. My sister really likes it, though she thinks it is a bit too much and mixes it with her fav face wash. My hubby and teenage kids really enjoy it as well. We use this daily. It removes the dead skin and leaves your face moisturized and clean feeling. There are not many products that can leave you thoroughly exfoliated and still feel moisturized!</li>
            <li> Love this for my face</li>
            <li> Great exfoliator! Would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I use it daily and feel my skin is truly softer and brighter. I got a friend to start using it as well after one use of mine. You really just need a little dollop to do the job as well so it lasts quite a long time.</li>
            <li> I had a sample of this at one time (from a Birchbox I think?) and so always when I run out of something fabulous, I check Amazon and sure enough - Amazon has it!  This stuff is great!  I use it in the shower to curb the mess factor.  I use it every other day.  It&#x27;s not abrasive and smells great!</li>
            <li> I like the combination of enzymes and polish crystals in this. Nice smell, nice feel. What&#x27;s not to like? Pricey, but you use very little. Lasts a long time for me, and I alternate with La Roche Posay&#x27;s Toleriane.</li>
            <li> Literally the best exfoliant I&#x27;ve ever used. Expensive, but worth it!</li>
            <li> I love this product. Great for exfoliation. Skin feels fresh and clean.&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;m glad i don&#x27;t have sensitive skin though.</li>
            <li> Delivers results as described/promised! My skin is brighter and smoother. I love the Vasanti line!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it.  Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I used to be a birchbox member but got tired of paying $10 a month to be inundated with samples I likely won&#x27;t use.  However, I discovered this face wash and it is amazing!! It&#x27;s the only wash I could use in the beginning of my pregnancy because everything else made me sick.  Light scent and faces feels great after!!</li>
            <li> Excellent Product! It is working wonders on my skin!</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this from another retailer and I loved it. My face was smoother (although I&#x27;m not sure about &amp;#34;brighter&amp;#34;). The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that it&#x27;s very coarse and abrasive if you use too much. I&#x27;ve found that less is more or mixing it with a regular cleanser does the trick.</li>
            <li> This is refreshing and a great skin smoothing cleanser. I highly recommend as a exfoliant. My skin always looks great after I use it.</li>
            <li> One of the worse things I bought.  Equate Apricot Scrub (Walmart brand) for pores is 2 bucks and  so much better than this crap.</li>
            <li> I love this face wash. It makes my face feel soft and smooth like nothing else I&#x27;ve ever used. Although it seems a bit pricey when compared to regular face washes you can buy at the drug store, you only need to use a small amount of product each time you wash your face, and only need to use it 3 or 4 times a week, so it lasts a really long time. For instance, I bought my current bottle at the end of July, and still have well over half of the bottle left and it&#x27;s mid-October. I expect it will last me around 6 months. Also, I feel like I should mention - I have somewhat sensitive skin, and this product doesn&#x27;t bother me. However, when my husband tried it he complained that it &amp;#34;burned&amp;#34; his face. His skin is much more sensitive to products than mine. So I guess I&#x27;d recommend avoiding the product if you have overly sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!! Makes your skin feel amazing</li>
            <li> LOVE this product! Tried a sampler that came in my birch box and had to buy the full size bottle once I ran out! It smells nice, it feels great on my skin and the exfoliating crystals are not too harsh. My skin is softer, brighter, and the stubborn blackheads on my nose are nearly gone.</li>
            <li> This product is an amazing exfoliant! It has helped improve the appearance of my skin by minimizing the appearance of scars on my chin, and evening out my skin tone. I use this product only once a week, and one tube lasts several months for me. I have used other exfoliants in the past including St. Ives Apricot scrub, Olay Fresh Effects, Neutrogena Deep Clean, L&#x27;Oreal Go 360 Deep Clean, and Suki Exfoliate Foaming Cleanser (which is a close second), but this is my favorite. It has a thick, concentrated consistency which makes it easy to use. I have found that some exfoliants contain too creamy of a base so that you can&#x27;t feel the exfoliant really working on your skin. I recommend applying using small circular motions and focusing on your problem areas. I clean my forehead, nose, and chin well and then gently exfoliate the rest of my face. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product for everyday use if you have normal skin because it will probably be too much. I use a foaming cleaner between uses. This is my favorite exfoliating product and I recommend it to all my friends and family. I think it is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Received a sample of this and HAD to buy the full size. It isn&#x27;t irritating and leaves my skin feeling so smooth and flawless. This is the only extra face product I need besides a cleanser and moisturizer. Will definitely repurchase!</li>
            <li> I was given a sample and now I&#x27;m hooked! Works like a charm when I have dry flaky skin. It&#x27;s almost unscented. This is the best!!!</li>
            <li> Smells very nice, leaves my skin soft and bright. Only down fall is the bottle comes half full. So just remember when you get it, it is only half. But other than that, a great product.</li>
            <li> My daughter turned me onto this product. She gave me a sample and I loved it. Bought my own and never looked back.</li>
            <li> I received this is as a sample and two full bottles later I am still a happy customer. I love this product because it makes my skin rosy and perfect! I let the shower steam up and then apply a pea sized amount to my face and neck. I scrub let is sit in and rinse off. The result is gorgeous refreshed skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Beltkiss Sanborn</li>
            <li> This stuff is excellent!</li>
            <li> I became hooked on this when I got a sample-size through a mail-order box.  This was a bit of a splurge, but it&#x27;s been worth every penny.  My skin is more radiant, and rarely ever gets flaky.  I use it 3x/wk in the shower, and let it sit on my face for 5 minutes or so before scrubbing off.  Moreover, I have sensitive skin, and it&#x27;s never made me red or irritated.  The investment has proved well worth it, as the tube has lasted me 9 months (and counting).</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this product through BirchBox and have completely loved it since. The micro beads really work when removing dead skin cells and my skin looks brighter and feels softer after use. I am in love with this product and will be purchasing it again.</li>
            <li> Although I am a bit older ( 38 years old) I was still getting pimples, and I was starting to get freckles, it seemed like my skin had uneven tones.&lt;br /&gt;Since I started buying the product, I saw a huge difference. This is my third or fourth time ordering it, I still love it. I am not saying my face became airbrushed but without it …. well my face looked kind of dirty …I know we are not suppose to use it daily but I do, and I just told my doughtier who is 17 to start using it, and her pimples faded.&lt;br /&gt;Although we can get something much cheaper, this product in my opinion is worth it.</li>
            <li> Amazing! Only thing I use now and have been using for the past year.  A little goes a long way, so it lasts forever!</li>
            <li> The product is thick so a small amount goes a long way; cleanses well and washes off easily. I do think my skin is brighter and smoother.  great size package should last awhile. I am picky about face wash and this is one of my favorites.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend; fast shipment</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I usually use Dr. Lancer&#x27;s face scrub, but this is finer and even more effective.  My skin looks and feels so clean, soft and radiant afterward.</li>
            <li> My favorite face product!</li>
            <li> I love the consistency, and you only need a little bit. It will last a long time. I&#x27;m hooked on it.</li>
            <li> Does what it says it will! My skin feels great afterwards. It is slightly abrasive if you use it as directed.</li>
            <li> I got this product in my birchbox and used it and really enjoyed it.&lt;br /&gt;Scrubs are a non-essential part of your routine. Exfoliation is great for your skin but you can get the same effect from a well formulated AHA or BHA cream.&lt;br /&gt;I would say to use one or the other. If you are already using an AHA or BHA then a scrub like this is unnecessary or even harmful.&lt;br /&gt;If you prefer the scrubs then go for this.&lt;br /&gt;It is expensive but Boots, Nivea, and Neutrogena all make cheaper products that are just as effective.</li>
            <li> This exfoliates your skin without irritating it. Similar to products used in a dermatologist&#x27;s office . Better than costly brands . It&#x27;s fantastic .</li>
            <li> Had to return this was not a good batch or black market product. I received a sample of this in a beauty box worked like a charm. Decided to give it a go purchased on amazon...nothing but terrible breakouts, swelling, and redness.</li>
            <li> By far the best facial scrub out there! Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Noticed a difference after the FIRST use!! Skin is already &amp;#34;calm&amp;#34; and cool. Redness has disappeared and the blemishes had subsided within a weeks or so! I&#x27;m using keeva tea tree moisturizer in conjunction with this product and have been super impressed with both companies!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like sand paper for my face.  Yes that sounds weird but I promise it&#x27;s a good thing. My skin feels so soft immediately after use, it&#x27;s not a &amp;#34;see results in 2 weeks&amp;#34; kind of thing.</li>
            <li> This product makes my skin feel soooo good. I love it.  I would recommend to anyone for a mild exfoliant.</li>
            <li> I got this product originally as a sample and had to have it! It&#x27;s a very light scrub and it leaves the skin even toned and smooth. It even removes makeup! I use it about three times a week for a brightness boost and I love it! Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I have been a fan of Vasanti&#x27;s cosmetics for years.  But they have outdone themselves with their new skin care line.  I recently tried out their BrightenUp face wash and it is AMAZING.  My skin feels so much smoother and I&#x27;ve been getting compliments from friends and family.  What I also love about BrightenUp - in comparison to other face washes - is the texture.  The grains in the scrub are not super rough and abrasive.  It&#x27;s also not filmy like other face washes.  You won&#x27;t be left feeling like you have any residue on your face.  This is great product and I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Best scrub I used in a long time-very fine.</li>
            <li> Awesome cleanser.  Brightens and softens.  I usually do not care for enzymatic products but love this one.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!  I am over 60, and I love the way my skin feels after I use this product.  Not too gritty and easily rinses off.  The micro crystals are the perfect size for polishing and exfoliating any kind of skin.  I definitely see a difference since I have started using this skin care product.  I don&#x27;t ever want to be without it again!</li>
            <li> WARNING!!! one told me not to use it for sensitive skin. It peeled off my skin around my eyes and mouth. It took 2 weeks for the skin to grow back!!!!!!!!!!!!!! For 2 weeks I had to walk around with a red raw face!!!!!! I hate this product! The picture shows my skin finally growing back but it&#x27;s still very red and sore and that&#x27;s with make up on! There&#x27;s no hiding it!!!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I feel like I actually get rid of all the dirt and oils when I use this product. The only downside is this product dries out the skin so make sure to use a moisturizer afterwards.</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING</li>
            <li> This is a great product! I received it as a sample from Birchbox, and got hooked pretty quick.  It&#x27;s perfect when you need to exfoliate.  Thanks, Vasanti!</li>
            <li> LOVE this product.  I received it as a sample on my Birchbox a few months ago and loved what it did to my skin.  I came to Amazon to buy it (PRIME) when I ran out of the sample.  This stuff makes my skin feel so clean, and so soft.  I started using it just 3 days a week so that I didn&#x27;t overdo it but lately I&#x27;ve been using it every morning with no problems whatsoever.  Worth EVERY penny!!!</li>
            <li> I dig it. So does my husband. A nice, gentle fine scrub on the face versus large apricot pits digging at your skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really do amazon reviews, but this is seriously THE BEST bargain for an exfoliator.  I received the Birchbox sample, which lasted me almost two months.  It may be a little pricier, but since a little goes a long way, I look at this splurge as an investment.  My skin feels so smooth and soft when I use it.  Plus, I have significantly less blackheads and bumps when this is part of my regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently received a facial and the aesthetician actually commented on how  radiant my skin looked.  I told her that I used Vasanti and she RAVED about it.  That was really what made me consider buying the full size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trust me.  This is worth every penny and more.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this in a birchbox and I absolutely loved it! I used it all up and definitely wanted more. I use it a couple times a week age it really helps with my skin texture, my tone, and pimples. I was so in love with it that I started using it everyday, bad idea. I started breaking out because it was too much exfoliating for my skin. The directions say a couple times a week but of course I didn&#x27;t listen. I went back to what the directions said and had no more problems. I have combination skin, more oily than dry, and I&#x27;m not very sensitive to products. This stuff feels great, like sand some what, and it&#x27;s really helped my breakouts...Its great!</li>
            <li> I received this product through a beauty subscription service that I subscribe to and love it! My skin is extremely sensitive and using this every 2-3 days has not irritated my skin (the package says to use 3-5 times a week). The exfoliating beads are very fine and feel pleasant on the face. One recommendation that I have is to use this on clean skin as it truly is a brightener, not a face wash; it is not meant to remove a full face of makeup. In a recent photo of myself after I began using this, I noticed a much dewier, healthy complexion. Very excited to purchase the full size product after I finish up my sample!</li>
            <li> It came on time and it was full. I love it, I got a sample in my birchbox and I decided I needed a full size. Makes my skin glow gets rid of black heads. Love!</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this in my Birchbox. I loved it and immediately purchased the full sized product. This is an exfoliating cleanser that you use with water. When cleansing your face make sure you are using adequate water and use a gentle circular motion on your face. Never rub hard or you will damage your skin as with any exfoliating cleanser. It says to use once or twice a week but I use it daily and have no problem on my sensitive skin. I find it&#x27;s easier to use in the shower each morning. My face feels wonderful afterwards. It removes all the dead skin cells that are sloughed off daily. I love the scent as well.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser! The micro-crystals: you don&#x27;t feel them on your hands or fingers, but they feel sharp on your face (in a good way!). It did feel like I was rubbing broken glass shards on my face for a few minutes, but I knew it was buffing my skin and taking all the nasty stuff with it. My moisturizer was almost instantly absorbed after cleansing with this scrub. I will be using this again and again. It is better than any cleanser I have tried - St. Ives, Escol, Olay, L&#x27;Oreal, etc.</li>
            <li> Great exfoliant yet gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li> The reason I don&#x27;t give 5 stars is because it is not as full as it looks. If you peek your eye through the hole when you first open up the package, about 1/3 of the bottle is empty space! Perhaps that&#x27;s part of it though, and keeps the consistency how it should be or something because boy oh boy is this face wash magical. Originally got the sample through Birch Box, and it changed my life. I had &#x27;moderate acne&#x27; and it definitely changed that to &#x27;light acne&#x27; and even NO acne on some days. Highly recommend, worth the money, and you don&#x27;t need a scrub since the microcrystals scrub for you.</li>
            <li> This was a sample in a Birchbox box. I first saw the tube and thought it would be too small to really see if it was effective. Wrong! As mentioned in another review, a very small amount is needed. After using it the first time, my skin felt great. It wasn&#x27;t tight, too dry or blotchy. I&#x27;ve been able to use this 5 times from a small tube. The regular size may cost more than I usually would pay but it will last awhile. And my face looks great. I have combination skin and I have had no problems. Highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> like everyone else, i got this as a sample in my birchbox subscription. i have extremely problematic skin..due to MS and the drugs i take for that and extremely dry skin to begin with, my face is always so dry it&#x27;s literally scaly and flaking as though it was awful dandruff, it&#x27;s incredibly embarrassing. but, it&#x27;s also incredibly sensitive... almost anything will make me break out, not to mention exfoliation type products. my skin is also always very read, like i&#x27;m blushing constantly! so, most products make that even worse. well, recently i was getting ready to go out with an old high school friend and wanted to get dressed up. i decided to give this product a whirl. it has a lovely texture, nothing like what you think when you picture exfoliation...no walnut shells here! it&#x27;s literally crystals, like super fine sugar,, possibly even finer. i squeezed out a pea sized amount which was more than enough and i scrubbed it on gently in circular motions as it said to, left it on a bit and washed it off. right way i noticed my face felt softer, but i was nervous it was going to be red! it didn&#x27;t burn though, it felt very nice. i got out, patted my face dry and looked in the mirror. my jaw literally dropped! not only was my face NOT red, it was a normal color and texture, for the first time in almost a decade!!  ...i understand that at first glance this product may seem spendy, but it&#x27;s amazing and you only need a tiny amount. it&#x27;s soooo worth it! i gave out little samples of it to the ladies in my family, so the sample didn&#x27;t last long. but NOOO hesitation on buying a full size!</li>
            <li> First got this stuff as a sample with my Birchbox and noticed a real difference in the softness and tone of my skin after using. I had never really bothered exfoliating regularly before I used this - now I use it at least 3-4x per week. It has a nice smell but not overly fragrant, the grains are really small and not rough on your skin and it rinses clean. Love using it in the summer especially when I&#x27;ve been walking around NYC all day and feel grimy as it leaves my face feeling really refreshed.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite face-related products.  It&#x27;s the best exfoliator I&#x27;ve found that has a reasonable price, and I enjoy the way my skin feels after using it.</li>
            <li> Oh My, do I LOVE this product. I received this originally in a subscription bag for beauty products. Instantly fell in love and ran out and purchased it.&lt;br /&gt;It feels so amazing while using it, it gets all the dead dull skin off and reveals a beautiful soft skin afterward. It has no strong odor and no harsh cleansers. The microcrystals are unlike ANY OTHER that i have even used, they&#x27;re small and rough and feel just wonderful. You do not have to use a lot, and I use about 2-3 times a week because I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife, so I cannot really talk from personal experience, but my wife loves it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome!!!! I received a sample from my Birchbox and I feel in love. My skin feel sop good after using it and it also helped clear my skin up. For those of you who haven&#x27;t tried it, you need to. I will be buying this in the future!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never really had acne per se, just a tendency for clogged pores/blackheads/etc that doesn&#x27;t respond well to most cleansers and other products.  I just got a sample of this (in Birchbox, like everyone else), and in ONE USE it stripped off the top layer of my T-zone area (where I focused on it in using), got everything unclogged, and worked off a bit of rough skin from where I picked at it previously (sorry, TMI, but it&#x27;s true), making everything look better.  Days later, I still have smooth skin and no bumps.  I didn&#x27;t even know this was possible, and without any weird irritation or ingredients I don&#x27;t like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I might also note, that my skin gets easily irritated by beta hydroxy products (like salicyclic acid), which are the usual line of defense for clogged pores, blackheads, etc.  So it&#x27;s nice that this works with alternative ingredients.</li>
            <li> I discovered this item after receiving it inside a Birchbox as a sample. After the very first use, I knew this item was for me. It makes your face feel baby soft, even after the very first use! A dollop about the size of a dime is enough to do your face and neck. So this big bottle will last you a long time. It&#x27;s pretty expensive- but knowing that you don&#x27;t have to use a lot each time, is with the money. You won&#x27;t be disappointed in this product. And Vasanti is a nice company. Post your picture up on Instagram with their product and they&#x27;ll leave you a nice comment!</li>
            <li> I have been using this stuff since Jan 2015 and I must say, my face feels and looks amazing. All you need is a small dab of it and you can wash your whole face. I&#x27;ve had it since January and it&#x27;s April and I still have probably another month&#x27;s worth, and I wash my face 2 times daily. Will definitely be purchasing this again when I get low.</li>
            <li> I initially received this product as a Birchbox sample, and ended up ordering it quickly so that I could save the sample size for traveling.  I already use a clarisonic, and have used St. Ives&#x27; apricot scrub in the past, but usually if I want serious exfoliation I&#x27;ll just scrub at my face with a washcloth.  That works, but it&#x27;s not great for my skin and leaves it pretty raw.    This product is gentle (I have pretty reactive skin, if not outright &#x27;sensitive&#x27;) but effective.  I use a little more than it recommends (\\&quot;pea-shaped\\&quot; amount, says Birchbox, but I use about 2 peas) but this size will still last for a few months.    Occasionally I&#x27;ll use it with my clarisonic, but I think it&#x27;s better just to use your hands over your face for the recommended 2-3 minutes, because the product will disappear into the clarisonic&#x27;s brush pretty quickly - clarisonic better with foaming soaps for that reason.    I don&#x27;t believe this product has the same \\&quot;microbead\\&quot; issues that similar products do with clogging water supply, etc.  The consistency is more like very fine salt or sugar - not as course as sand.    I think the &#x27;fruit enzymes&#x27; (acid ingredient) is enough to be effective, but not enough to cause negative reactions for most users.    Definitely recommend this product, although I ended up finding it cheaper on Birchbox&#x27;s website with a first-time buyer coupon and bought it in bulk there - but Amazon ships faster.    Update: I used this for the first time this week on dry skin, whereas I usually use it in the shower.  It&#x27;s definitely a rougher and probably more effective exfoliation.  If you have sensitive skin, use in the shower or fully wet your face and hands before using and that should help!</li>
            <li> I first discovered this when given a sample of it. After just one week, I was sold on it! I am in my early 40&#x27;s, and have noticed some dark blotchy areas showing up on my cheeks which is evidently common for women my age. Within just the first week of using this product, the spots were visibly lighter. Also, I have combination skin that is very sensitive. I have had allergic reactions to many many cleansers. My skin loves it! There is just enough exfoliant in it to buff the skin without being harsh. My skin feels so clean after cleansing. I&#x27;m almost addicted to washing my face! lol I use it more frequently than suggested, and it works great for me as a daily cleanser. I realize that these results will vary from person to person, but my experience with Vasanti Brighten Up has been very positive, and I do highly recommend it if you have issues similar to mine.</li>
            <li> Really gear stuff. A bottle lasted me almost 5 months, using it 3-4 times a week. I will be buying again.</li>
            <li> This is a great daily facial scrub! Great seller!</li>
            <li> Received birchbox sample and I too instantly fell in love.  I will be ordering full size.  Goodbye to my OTC green &amp; white tube.  I&#x27;ve been trying &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; products for a while.  My face looked and felt beautifully rejuvenated.  Smooth and renewed.</li>
            <li> No complaints at all. Very fine sand like feel but not rough on skin. Good in shower face polish.</li>
            <li> I also got a sample from Birchbox and I let it sit in the drawer for a while. I had some health issues and neglected doing anything to my 55+ face for several weeks except washing it with Neutrogena soap twice a day. As a result, I had rough, dull skin that I figured would take weeks of scrubbing and moisturizing faithfully to correct. I thought I would give this a try even though anything with &amp;#34;exfoliate&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;peel&amp;#34; in the description scares me to death because my ultra fair skin is very sensitive.  There was no burning or stinging and just a slight gritty feeling to the product. I gently massaged it in a circular motion and then rinsed. My face is always bright red for a while after washing so I didn&#x27;t really look at it immediately. When I went to apply moisturizer I was flabbergasted!  My skin was baby-smooth and felt wonderful!  I grabbed a mirror and was further amazed to see clear, healthy-looking skin!  This was just after ONE use.  I want to keep it looking this way so I&#x27;m ordering more. This isn&#x27;t a wrinkle reducer but is a very gentle, yet effective exfoliant.  I know the terms &amp;#34;gentle&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;effective exfoliant&amp;#34; sound mutually exclusive, the both are true. If you have rough, dull skin, you need to try this!  It also has NOT dried out my skin at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  5/7/15&lt;br /&gt;I still think this is an amazing product.  I try to use it once or twice a week and my 60 year-old skin looks amazing.  I have noticed a decrease in pore size, elimination of all blackheads and rough patches.  I&#x27;m still using my first bottle that I bought a year ago so it ends up being very inexpensive in the long run.</li>
            <li> Tried this as a sample through Birchbox and loved it. Very gentle to my skin while leaving it smooth. Makes everything from make up to moisturizer work better.</li>
            <li> I purchased this upon the recommendation of a friend.  My face is often flaky and dry in spots and acne has become more of an issue as I have gotten older (I&#x27;m 39).  This cleanser feels great to massage into my face.  The little microbeads are so soothing and not at all harsh as some exfoliating products can be.  The directions suggest using the product 3-5 times a week but I have been using it daily to get my face into better shape.  I plan to scale back to the recommended 3-5 times a week once my skin looks like I want.  I have already noticed less flaky, dry skin and the acne seems to be decreasing.  I will purchase this product again!</li>
            <li> Love this product ,,,,,,</li>
            <li> Aluminum Oxide - Superfine crystals (NOT plastic polyethylene beads) used in microdermabrasion type treatments, are the 2nd ingredient. If you like dense, &amp;#34;scrubby&amp;#34; exfoliators, it&#x27;s LOADED with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Decyl Glucoside - superior sulfate-free cleansing agent, great at dissolving oil, dirt, and makeup (&#x27;Tho you shouldn&#x27;t use this as an eye makeup remover due to the crystals)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cocamidopropyl Betaine - a gentle, sulfate-free cleansing agent&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Papain (papaya enzyme) - calling it &amp;#34;Enriched&amp;#34; is a stretch. the amount is negligible, and next to the preservative, it&#x27;s probably less than 1%. The exfoliation really comes from the microcrystals-- but of course it sounds better with the marketing word &amp;#34;enzymatic&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glycerin, Cetyl Alcohol, Emulsifying Wax, etc- allows for the &amp;#34;slip&amp;#34; and smooth texture, acts as emulsifier to bind the scrub together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rest of the ingredients are minimal and added in for marketing purposes (Aloe, Vit E, Castor Seed Oil). But they&#x27;re not really needed b/c the scrub is so effective and gentle -- a true &amp;#34;polish&amp;#34; for your face, erasing all dead skin cells, leaving your skin baby soft and crystal clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A simple, effective product for those who prefer physical exfoliation (scrubs) vs. chemical exfoliation (i.e. peels).</li>
            <li> This is such a great face cleanser. I use it everyday. It has kept my face from breaking out! Keeps my skin feeling very silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> Love this scrub! I have been using it for awhile and make my skin soft and refreshed!</li>
            <li> love love love this product - makes my face super soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> I heard raves about this product through birchbox but did not like it at all.  This is a grainy but soft exfoliator that is supposed to brighten your skin. 20 minutes after the first time I used it, my skin was red and I started to get small pimples form on my cheeks. I returned the product to the company and the honored my refund right away. Very good customer service, I am just sorry the product did not work for me.</li>
            <li> I am addicted to this stuff. It works so well! All of my other products work better because of it too. My lotions and serums settle in faster, my skin looks brighter and more even - especially when I work out! I turn very red, and I can tell this does an amazing, EVEN job because my red skin is very even, instead of patchy like it can be with other exfoliators.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Birchbox for such an amazing find! The first time I used it, I felt like there was glass on my face... in a good way lol! It can be too rough if you overuse it, and that can lead to some small pimples, but I&#x27;ve never had it cause any big breakouts if I&#x27;m using it correctly. You&#x27;ll also know pretty quickly if that&#x27;s going to happen, I mean I&#x27;m usually still finishing my skin care routine, and that gives me plenty of time to combat the pimples right when they show up. In general, this has been the best anti-acne step I&#x27;ve used EVER! And it&#x27;s great for other parts of the body too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am thoroughly addicted. I never want this product out of my life.</li>
            <li> Ive spent most of my post adolescent years searching for a good exfoliant. this is the one!  and Im 40. :)</li>
            <li> This is a great product! My daughter-in-law and I both love it and will continue to buy it from you!</li>
            <li> Like microdermabrasion in a bottle. Cleanses, exfoliates, and rinses clean, but not too harsh or irritating. I feel cleaner and clearer on the days I use it.</li>
            <li> Leaves my face feeling soft and refreshed. Provides a deep scrubbing clean with its exfoliants. I use it a few times a week and follow it up by using a high quality moisturizer from Kiehls, to prevent dryness. I love this product.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff. At first I questioned the consistency, but after going through three bottles of the stuff now, I am a believer. It is easy to use, no noticeable smell, and does not irritate my very sensitive skin. It is great for a quick exfoliating scrub, or you can leave it on like a mask for a few extra minutes and let the enzymes do their thing for even better results. My skin is noticeably smoother, my skin tone is more even, and my face just looks all around brighter. I will never stop using this product.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this item!!!! It truly is like a mini micro- abrasion treatment!!! My skin feels smoother, fine lines seem to be diminishing, and dark spots are lightening. It only takes a very small amount, so it should last several months.</li>
            <li> Like many reviewers, I first learned about this product through Birchbox, which gave me a 20g sample size. I first noticed on the bottle that it is 99% natural - and is sulfate and paraben free, and uses coconut, aloe, papaya and other natural ingredients to provide its scrubbing action. I hate (yes, HATE) most drug store &amp;#34;scrubs&amp;#34; with their giant plastic beads that do nothing for actual scrubbing. They end up being flushed down the drain, most the time, which is why it is being banned in a lot of cities due to the footprint they leave. This has none of those bead spheres, and is most similar to an aspirin mask, with very fine gritty particles that you can actually feel exfoliate your skin! It&#x27;s even finer than a body sugar scrub, and way less messy!&lt;br /&gt;Also, the price may be higher than your typical drugstore brands, but this is an adult product, and it lasts forever! You can easily get 4-6 months out of a regular sized tube, since you really only need a pea size for it to work. Your skin is smoother, as it sloughs off old, uneven skin and leaves you with baby soft skin that really feels great. I use this in my 20&#x27;s and love how it makes my skin feel!&lt;br /&gt;With many organic products, I worry about the shelf life without preservatives, but with 1 bottle lasting 4-6 months, I try to just re-order when my supply is low, rather than stockpiling a bunch of them on my shelf.&lt;br /&gt;Try it- you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> Life changing. End of story. You NEED it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best face scrub I have ever used!</li>
            <li> This product has been amazing with evening out my skin. I use it 3 times a week, any more than that and I over-exfoliate and end up with dry patches of skin on my face. So 3 alternating days a week is perfect.The reviews are correct that the bottle isn&#x27;t full of product (I don&#x27;t know any product that actually is for that matter) but I felt the price for the amount of product I got (about 2/3 of a bottle) was fair considering how long it lasts. You only need a pea-sized amount to do the job. I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Removes dead skin effectively without irritating my VERY sensitive skin. Gives me a nice little glow!</li>
            <li> I originally received this as a sample in a Birchbox...instant love.  My sister had tried it and fell in love.  So I had to have the full product.  It was just a few cents cheaper to purchase on here rather than Birchbox.  So win for Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this about every other day.  A pea-sized amount goes a long way.  It makes your face feel.... I don&#x27;t know... alive?  The micro-beads are truly micro.  They do not scratch your skin or leave it irritated (on me anyway).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best usage-  pea-sized amount.  work into your face with a light/soft touch- rub in using circles.  Avoid the eyes and let it stay on your face for a couple of minutes.  I will put it on and maybe wash my body, or rinse my hair...etc.  Rinse it off and experience the magic!</li>
            <li> I love this product. Using it feels like having a mini micordermabrasion.  I am glad I found this product and it will be my go to product for exfoliants.</li>
            <li> I ordered this after seeing all the rave reviews... YES THEY ARE ALL TRUE! This stuff is amazing; I cannot believe the brighter, rosy glow in my complexion after just one use. I use this every other day (I leave it on for the recommended 2-3 minutes), and along with a spin brush once a week. The results are at least just a good as getting a professional facial, in my opinion. Love the packaging, too; easy to store in the shower and get out just the right amount of product. A true holy grail for me; I hope this product is never discontinued!</li>
            <li> This product is positively phenomenal! I too received it as a Birchbox sample and I was so impressed with the results. I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s and I&#x27;ve been feeling the need to do something more to care for the skin on my face, but so many exfoliants are just too harsh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This made my face feel soft as butter and brightened and toned my skin - all without the least bit of irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am gladly purchasing the full sized product; which I expect will last a while, since you only need use a small amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m lovin&#x27; the glow!!!</li>
            <li> Really like this stuff! will update review once I have used for a bit longer but it really seems to even out skin tone and makeup goes on like a dream after this!</li>
            <li> Love this exfoliater!</li>
            <li> Received this in my birchbox.  Absolutely love this product.  I use it in conjunction with Nerium.  I&#x27;m 46 and my skin is looking a lot better!!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff--on my second tube. I don&#x27;t use it every day (maybe once or twice a week), it&#x27;s just too much for my skin. If you leave it on for a few minutes, you get a chemical exfoliation also. The scrubby part is perfect. You only need a pea size amount (really!).A tube of this lasts me just about a year.</li>
            <li> This scrub is amazing! It&#x27;s like your own microdermabrasion treatment at home. Really does brighten the face and helps lighten age spots. Love it!</li>
            <li> This is the perfect combination of cleanser and scrub. It smells amazing and feels divine. After washing with this nightly for a week my skin was visibly more clear. More pores look cleaner and the tone is better as well. I don&#x27;t know how I lived with out this product! Highly recommend. My skin type is combination, acne prone and has slight signs of aging. This is my new staple piece!</li>
            <li> I actually discovered this product through birchbox.  It has a very very fine consistency.  It can feel scratchy, BUT that depends on how hard you rub it on your skin.  I find it works best by first wetting your face, then dispersing a small amount on your hand and then applying in gentle circular motions to your face and neck.  It really does leave my skin feeling clearer and softer.  I use it once or twice a week.  It has a very nice and very light scent.  It also lasts for a while.  I normally use NIA24 scrub, but sometimes my skin didn&#x27;t respond greatly to that.  Again, I am very leery of trying new stuff because I hate wasting money and then accumulating tons of meh products.  Had I not gotten a sample from birchbox, I would not have spent the $ on this.  But trust me, it is definitely worth it, works much better than commercial scrubs.  My skin type is mixed by the way, oily t zone, dry cheeks.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser.  I got a sample via Birch Box and used it with my clarisonic - the results were amazing and my skin felt brighter and very soft.  Will definitely buy this product again.</li>
            <li> At first i thought this scrub was too gentle for the job, but once you apply it and massage you really feel the tiny crystals scrubbing.  After two minutes of scrubbing i left it on for a few more. My skin looks good and i even noticed red acne marks reduced.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  My face has had some breakouts since use, but I expected that to occur.  My face looks much much better now.  Daily.</li>
            <li> Okay so I got a sample of this in my monthly birch box and I LOVED it! So I searched on here and found it. Needless to say I ordered the big size cuz I know I will use it ALL! It makes your face feel super soft only issue I had was it looked a little damaged. But works like a charm. I will forever use this stuff!</li>
            <li> I love this exfoliator. I use it a few times a week to give my face a good, deep cleaning. When I wash it off, it leaves my skin feeling smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> I Love this product.  It makes my skin super smooth and soft without being crazy abrasive. I use it once or twice a week and my skin stays in great shape.</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this in my birchbox and fell in love with it. The super tiny micro beads reminds me of a getting a microdermabrasion and my skin looks and feels so soft after I use it. I only use it about once a week even though it says you can use it more often.</li>
            <li> Having tried my share of exfoliants, I often have a hard time finding one that is a perfect balance between exfoliating enough to be effective yet not so much to be irritating. This one fits the bill as a perfect match. I use a pea-sized amount, scrub using hands for 2 minutes, and leave it on for another few while brushing teeth. So far lasted a year and is still helping me achieve a glowing complexion!</li>
            <li> This is the best exfoliator I have ever use!</li>
            <li> This is easily the best face wash I have ever used. I have fairly sensitive skin, and this is one of the few face washes that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  It does exactly what you would wish your face wash would do.  When you use it, your face actually feels free of dirt and oil and refreshed.  It&#x27;s pretty life changing.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this! Quite a few years ago I found a microdermabrasion from Avon. I absolutely loved it because it had little scrubbing bits in it they did not dissolve as you used it. I cannot stand a scrub that has dissolving bits or little pieces of things that are so soft they don&#x27;t even scrub your skin. This will now be my go to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample of this, I think in a birch box, and fell in love. The small sample did not say to leave it on your face for an extended amount of time if you wanted to increase the enzyme effects.  This larger bottle does. I did notice, once I started doing that, that I had some minor breakouts. I would not attribute that to sensitivity, but the fact that the enzymes were drawing the impurities out of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is THE BEST!</li>
            <li> I received a sample in my birchbox last month and used it every other day until i ran out. My face feels amazing after i use it and the gross grimy feeling i get after a rough day at work is gone. I feel like a new woman. I HAD to order the full size. I&#x27;m ibm my late 20&#x27;s and trying harder to take care of my skin and this is the answer. So amazing!</li>
