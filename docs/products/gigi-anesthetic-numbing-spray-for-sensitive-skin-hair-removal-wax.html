            <li>Awesome product.  </li>
            <li>Love it !!!!</li>
            <li>But the service I received from the sender was great and in a timely fashion!</li>
            <li>Very good product to use for waxing my body.</li>
            <li>This product worked good!</li>
            <li>This product is great.</li>
            <li>It has a good smell and worked great for my underarms.</li>
            <li>I think this spray is good for what I need it for.</li>
            <li>I am recovering from a spine operation and cannot walk good because of pain.</li>
            <li>This is a good product it takes away some of the pain from my Brazilian</li>
            <li>This works really good</li>
            <li>GOOD FOR USE WITH HAIR REMOVAL SYSTEM.</li>
            <li>ALSO GOOD FOR CUTS AND SCRAPES</li>
            <li>Good product&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li>And it seemed to manipulate the areas I was working on causing the wax to not adhere to the skin as good....</li>
            <li>:) will keep using!</li>
            <li>Just wanted to leave great feed back for a flawless transaction!    </li>
            <li>nice smell to it however.</li>
            <li>Thanks for this great product which I will never run out of !!!!</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use and to carry with you.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with this product because there are products that say they are cooling but they use menthol or something that quickly turns warm or even hot!</li>
            <li>Also it has a wonderful smell and leaves your skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li>It is okay, wasn&#x27;t as effective.</li>
            <li>Boy, did it arrive Quickly!!</li>
            <li>I tried without and could not stand the pain with the product I was able to epilate my stomache below my belly button.</li>
            <li>and it takes the pain away for most of the day.</li>
            <li>As a medical spray, it&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
            <li>My technician recommended trying this spray, so I used it today and my laser experience was SO much better.</li>
            <li>So I have to use the laser system on the lowest setting, resulting in more sessions.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure I&#x27;d be able to do it again.</li>
            <li>Better than using nothing.  </li>
            <li>Used this for the first time and it is amazing!</li>
            <li>#34;I love it.&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>Okay, I bought this product at a brick and mortar store for underarm waxing.  </li>
            <li>I bought the tiny can and hoped for the best.  </li>
            <li>It was ok.</li>
            <li>I received it very fast and was a good price.</li>
            <li>but Bactine works pretty good for waxing pain.</li>
            <li>so it works pretty good as well.</li>
            <li>For first timers, it is good to have all the help you can get for the \\&quot;pain\\&quot; part of waxing.  </li>
            <li>Just love it, if you apply it 10 min before waxing you won&#x27;t even feel so it makes really easy to wax in home</li>
            <li>Okay so the item claims that it takes the sting out of waxing, and looking at the fantastic price, I gave it a shot.</li>
            <li>I have never been able to take doing my entire bikini area with the Braun, but with the numbing spray I was able to do a great job.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s easy to spray and comes off easier than olive oil.</li>
            <li>but this one is the most effective (i don&#x27;t really know why</li>
            <li>EASY TO APPLY CONVENIENT SIZE TO USE WHEN TRAVELING.</li>
            <li>If your looking for something pain free then stick to shaving.</li>
            <li>I will never ever buy another cheap product from gigi</li>
            <li>does not numb any pain!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great remedy to combine with other treatments and I will be using it again; just not for hair removal.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the $.</li>
            <li>This stuff does not numb at all.</li>
            <li>Well worth the the price.</li>
            <li>great stuff also good with cutting toe nails make them nuns</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth having.</li>
            <li>I really was nervous about getting waxed for the first time (who isnt??!!)</li>
            <li>I like it very much.</li>
            <li>First, I do not think this spray is for waxing.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>I really wanted it to work, believe me!</li>
            <li>but this seems to work pretty well for that purpose.</li>
            <li>i have tried many different things</li>
            <li>It last for about 10 or 15 minutes at most.</li>
            <li>I literally could not feel the hair being ripped out but be sure your wax is on low.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize how hot mine was until I burned myself</li>
            <li>For a first timer getting waxed, I would go ahead and buy this to use in addition to either taking tylenol or motrin one hour before you go to the salon.  </li>
            <li>does not numb really at all.</li>
            <li>At times this product helped me in very \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; areas, but at other times it wasn&#x27;t so effective.</li>
            <li>Luckily this product is so cheap that I didn&#x27;t loose much.</li>
            <li>The same day that GiGi Honee Anesthestic Numbing Spray package arrive I had a cut I clean the area where I had the cut and then spray GiGi in the cut it felted like a sting at first</li>
            <li>this is not the same degree of numbing that you would get with a local injection, but as far as a topical spray goes, it is very good.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll be much happier.</li>
            <li>Did absolutely NOTHING.  </li>
            <li>It really helps with the bikini area.</li>
            <li>but this spray really helped take the sting out</li>
            <li>I use it before I use my epilator&#x27; which is a mechanically hair tweezer that removes hair from the body and this product really helps to lessen the pain a whole lot.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t expect it to have as much product for the size of the can.</li>
            <li>It works but it doesn&#x27;t work real well.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say that I really noticed it helping though.</li>
            <li>It worked but you have to work fast</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really notice any effect that it had.</li>
            <li>I was really hoping for this to work.</li>
            <li>;  The price was low and the delivery was super fast.</li>
            <li>I also have \\&quot;Put it on Ice\\&quot; by True Blue Spa from Bath and Body Works which is for sunburns and scrapes and pains</li>
            <li>After half an hour, I spray another coat, making sure that it gets to my skin.</li>
            <li>I used this for my third bikini wax, it works great and you only feel a little pain, nothing like before without it.</li>
            <li>this didn&#x27;t do it for more than a few minutes</li>
            <li>i used the spray prior to epilation, however, i was able to feel a considerable amount of discomfort even after multiple applications.</li>
            <li>Robin - New York</li>
            <li>Great product really does seem to help numb the pain.</li>
            <li>It takes a lot of the sting out of waxing, especially in very sensitive areas.</li>
            <li>I purchased the Gigi spray to use on my very sensitive clients ......  </li>
            <li>Since it stays on the skin level and does not penetrate to the nerves, it does not remove all the pain, but definitely reduces the pain to a large extent.</li>
            <li>It is OK, it numbed a little bit, but I have a very low pain threshold.</li>
            <li>Good concept but had a little trouble getting the wax to stick to the hair once I used it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a baby when it comes to waxing such a sensitive area and was really hopeful this product would help some.</li>
            <li>What I do think is that since it has Lidocaine in it which you really need a prescription for, that the only way to sell over the counter is to say that it numbs for Waxing.</li>
            <li>Then late afternoon I might spray more.</li>
            <li>Unfortunatley even after following the directions it was no help and didn&#x27;t seem to really have an effect at all.</li>
            <li>each completely garbage</li>
            <li>problems so far.</li>
            <li>This product doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well as I&#x27;d hoped.</li>
            <li>Not only did it not numb the skin enough for me to cut the tag off</li>
            <li>Pretty easy to use, and it seems to work pretty well if you wait awhile for the epilation, or whatever, to give it time to numb the skin.  </li>
            <li>Notice no other manufacturer sells this.</li>
            <li>Get &amp;#34;No Scream Cream&amp;#34; or something with higher percent like 20% active ingredient.</li>
            <li>Personally, I have a high pain tolerance and bought this simply to test as a precaution.</li>
            <li>The numbing sensation can be felt within a couple of minutes and lasts enough to have your waxing done completely.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really feel more numb after spraying this on my skin.</li>

            <li> Last a long time too.</li>
            <li> If you need a complete numbing effect, then you have inject yourself with the dentist&#x27;s anesthetic or use some prescription cream, so that the numbness gets down to your nerves.</li>
            <li> NOT this product, it really is cold when it goes on and stays that way which is important to me and the pain killing ability does work!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t absorb, and if you&#x27;re using it to numb a mosquito bite, you be better off to put nail polish over it.</li>
            <li> Was a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> Complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> You would have a better result if you used dry ice to numb the area.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t work for very long, i itch and was looking for something that didn&#x27;t smell or feel greasy and work.  </li>
            <li> I am in the middle of having 6 underarm laser hair removal treatments and it is the most painful experience in the world.</li>
            <li> it really DOES cut the edginess out of derma-rolling, without making me so numb that I put on too much pressure and accidentally cause unwanted bleeding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s quite more expensive than here on amazon.com, but it did nothing but wasted my time and money.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money doesn&#x27;t work, i tried using this product several different times</li>
            <li> I have used this on my bikini line and it does take a little bit of the sting out of the waxing process, but not enough to warrant buying the product.  </li>
            <li> I have painful plantar warts on my heel, and it stops the aching and irritation so I can finally sleep and walk comfortably.</li>
            <li> One thing I think that helps is spraying it on, rubbing it in till its dried, then spraying it on a second time and rubbing it in again.</li>
            <li> Definite waste of money.</li>
            <li> Absolutely no difference in feeling.</li>
            <li> i discovered it a few years back and using it since then.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s work not very well..</li>
            <li> The third time I used this spray 15 minutes before and it was twice as bad as the first two times!!</li>
            <li> Now I need to try some other products that work for waxing :X</li>
            <li> it just makes the area oily and harder to wax!</li>
            <li> It does take the edge off a little, but only a little.</li>
            <li> I used other products and it didn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li> However, even after doing this it still doesn&#x27;t make a big difference even on hairs that are thin and don&#x27;t go deep in the skin.     </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work - yes your skin feels a little numb when you&#x27;re not doing anything, but it still feels exactly the same when you pull the hair out.  </li>
            <li> hard part is targeting the spray, since the face is such a small area, with very delicate regions, AND it DOES spray as fast as you&#x27;d expect any spray can to spray and it will run.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not really worth it.</li>
            <li> I had to spray nearly half the bottle</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t numb completely but definitely takes the Edge off.</li>
            <li> and I was in much less pain than my friend who came with me and did not have spray.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of the spray and it makes waxing my bikini line much less painful!</li>
            <li> It feels a little greasy too, which  don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> After spraying, I rub the area a little bit.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really numb the skin very  well.</li>
            <li> No use in buying this, just a waste of money.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really work other that to trick my brain into thinking it&#x27;s working and doesn&#x27;t hurt as bad.</li>
            <li> and It really makes it less painful.</li>
            <li> This stuff not only is completely useless, it actually made it worse.</li>
            <li> but then it calmed the pain while I was doing on myself a few small stitches in the cut.</li>
            <li> Last time I had laser there with ice only it was SO PAINFUL</li>
            <li> The can is so small.  </li>
            <li> Not sure it&#x27;s working the way I thought it would.</li>
            <li> Also bottle is really small.</li>
            <li> Waste of money, it doesn&#x27;t work at all!</li>
            <li> I rated this one star because I didn&#x27;t have a choice of negative three stars.</li>
            <li> I used this to wax cheast and back before trip did not make skin numb at all.</li>
            <li> the smell is not pleasant either.</li>
            <li> I use it when I use Gigi hard Brazilian wax, so as long as I use the base oil with this spray, I&#x27;m not in agony.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions, and I wasn&#x27;t even numb a little bit.</li>
            <li> it smells horrible and does absolutely nothing</li>
            <li> It smells bad and leaves a slightly oily residue.</li>
            <li> Was skeptical when I received this after reading the ingredients.  </li>
            <li> useless product</li>
            <li> Didnt work at all, sorry</li>
            <li> the spray is greasy also making it difficult to epilate.</li>
            <li> the spray is expensive for the amount.</li>
            <li> but my skin even started to get numb.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take all the pain away, but it does numb your...sensitive areas to the point where you can stand removing the hair.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t numb anything at all for me.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect it to numb you like the dentist&#x27;s anesthetic.</li>
            <li> The product sprays out cold from the can.</li>
            <li> I think the cold is what is supposed to help numb you</li>
            <li> I purchased this to numb my skin to remove a skin tag on my thigh.  </li>
            <li> Every time I use the product it does what it is designed to do numb.</li>
            <li> I use it to partially numb my face before derma-needling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But i was completely wrong, it worked for me!</li>
            <li> This spray is useless!</li>
            <li> but it smells really bad.</li>
            <li> I bought it to spray the skin around my toenail because I have bad ingrown toenails.  </li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m off to find another product that may help :(</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t numb the skin like it&#x27;s supposed to, but it does help the wax not stick to my skin!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel any numbing :(</li>
            <li> Completely worthless..</li>
            <li> It is not that bad though!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had them twice before and they&#x27;re excruciatingly painful for me.  </li>
            <li> It helped a lot as it is very painful to get the nail out.  </li>
            <li> SMELLS REALLY NASTY!!!</li>
            <li> I would look for something else the pain was still awful!!</li>
            <li> I could go without it and be just as miserable with the hair removal process.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Takes the edge off of waxing. Obviously, you&#x27;ll still feel some pain but it&#x27;s nowhere close to waxing without the spray. Definitely worth the $.</li>
            <li> I would rather have razor bumps from shaving than use this product. Does not give any pain relief or numbing sensations to areas used. Instead of numbing and relief I was left with pain and irritated skin. Spend the extra bucks and go with &#x27;No Scream Cream&#x27;. You&#x27;ll be much happier.</li>
            <li> Was skeptical when I received this after reading the ingredients.  But i was completely wrong, it worked for me! I would recommend this to anyone that waxes!</li>
            <li> Just wanted to leave great feed back for a flawless transaction!    Thank you!</li>
            <li> I used this product on my stomache before epilation and it made all the difference in the world. I tried without and could not stand the pain with the product I was able to epilate my stomache below my belly button. Also it has a wonderful smell and leaves your skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li> I think this spray is good for what I need it for. First, I do not think this spray is for waxing. What I do think is that since it has Lidocaine in it which you really need a prescription for, that the only way to sell over the counter is to say that it numbs for Waxing. So they can sell it. Notice no other manufacturer sells this. Anyway, It does work for me. I am recovering from a spine operation and cannot walk good because of pain. I have my husband spray it on where the rods are on my back, then all over my back and it takes the pain away for most of the day. Then late afternoon I might spray more. So, It does work for me. But I doubt it works for waxing. That&#x27;s just my opinion. I wish it came in a larger size. The can is so small.  Robin - New York</li>
            <li> I picked this up at Sally&#x27;s and used it liberally for my brazilian wax. I&#x27;ve had them twice before and they&#x27;re excruciatingly painful for me.  The third time I used this spray 15 minutes before and it was twice as bad as the first two times!! I actually CRIED.  No kidding.    This stuff not only is completely useless, it actually made it worse.</li>
            <li> Okay so the item claims that it takes the sting out of waxing, and looking at the fantastic price, I gave it a shot. One thing I think that helps is spraying it on, rubbing it in till its dried, then spraying it on a second time and rubbing it in again. However, even after doing this it still doesn&#x27;t make a big difference even on hairs that are thin and don&#x27;t go deep in the skin.     As a medical spray, it&#x27;s wonderful. I have painful plantar warts on my heel, and it stops the aching and irritation so I can finally sleep and walk comfortably. It&#x27;s a great remedy to combine with other treatments and I will be using it again; just not for hair removal. This item shouldn&#x27;t be sold among the beauty products.</li>
            <li> Good concept but had a little trouble getting the wax to stick to the hair once I used it. But I only use this on my mom and my sister.</li>
            <li> This stuff didn&#x27;t work at all, I haven&#x27;t even bothered finishing it. I just use my epilator without anything now. I&#x27;d rather use nothing than use something that doesn&#x27;t work. It feels a little greasy too, which  don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> Bought this product from the store in the city....it&#x27;s quite more expensive than here on amazon.com, but it did nothing but wasted my time and money.  I&#x27;d say DO NOT buy this product. Now I need to try some other products that work for waxing :X</li>
            <li> I admit I haven&#x27;t tried this product but Bactine works pretty good for waxing pain. It contains a local analgesic called Benzocaine, which is similar to Lidocaine which is probably in this product. When I go waxing I Spray a ton of Bactine on the area to be waxed beforehand. I also have \\&quot;Put it on Ice\\&quot; by True Blue Spa from Bath and Body Works which is for sunburns and scrapes and pains, it has Lidocaine AND Menthol in it so it works pretty good as well. Massage this stuff thoroughly into your skin and you will have reduced surface pain quite a bit! HOWEVER!! WAXING HURTS NO MATTER WHAT SO DON&#x27;T EXPECT SOME MIRACLE CURE FROM ANYTHING! ;)</li>
            <li> This spray is useless! it just makes the area oily and harder to wax! does not numb any pain! useless product</li>
            <li> This stuff does not numb at all.</li>
            <li> This product did not wrk at all. I had to spray nearly half the bottle but my skin even started to get numb. Definite waste of money.</li>
            <li> No use in buying this, just a waste of money. Tried waxing with and without this, no difference. DO NOT BUY!!</li>
            <li> I am in the middle of having 6 underarm laser hair removal treatments and it is the most painful experience in the world. Not kidding. My technician recommended trying this spray, so I used it today and my laser experience was SO much better. I could still feel some of the lasers but the numbing spray helped alot. I would definitely recommend this product if you are doing laser treatments!</li>
            <li> Pretty easy to use, and it seems to work pretty well if you wait awhile for the epilation, or whatever, to give it time to numb the skin.  Will not be trying epilation without using it, as I&#x27;m a physical coward when it comes to pain.</li>
            <li> Bought this to use with a home laser hair removal system. It doesn&#x27;t really numb the skin very  well. So I have to use the laser system on the lowest setting, resulting in more sessions.</li>
            <li> If you like to get close to your goods for men&#x27;s Brazilian waxing your gonna want to use this! AAA+++</li>
            <li> I have used an epilator for years and thought I&#x27;d try this.  Did absolutely NOTHING.  Was a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item along with the Gigi Waxing Kit to upkeep my bikini area. I&#x27;m a baby when it comes to waxing such a sensitive area and was really hopeful this product would help some. Unfortunatley even after following the directions it was no help and didn&#x27;t seem to really have an effect at all. I really wanted it to work, believe me! So I&#x27;m off to find another product that may help :(</li>
            <li> I tried this last night before using my Braun Silk-Epil.  It doesn&#x27;t take all the pain away, but it does numb your...sensitive areas to the point where you can stand removing the hair.  I have never been able to take doing my entire bikini area with the Braun, but with the numbing spray I was able to do a great job.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t numb the skin like it&#x27;s supposed to, but it does help the wax not stick to my skin! I could use olive oil but this seems to work pretty well for that purpose. And it&#x27;s easy to spray and comes off easier than olive oil. I&#x27;ll use it anyway.</li>
            <li> SMELLS REALLY NASTY!!! IT IS TOO OILY AND IT DOES NOT WORK ONE BIT!!! I DO NOT RECOMMENT IT TO ANYONE!!!</li>
            <li> I rated this one star because I didn&#x27;t have a choice of negative three stars. The only reason I&#x27;m writing a review is to warn others. I followed the instructions, and I wasn&#x27;t even numb a little bit. I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
            <li> I used this for my third bikini wax, it works great and you only feel a little pain, nothing like before without it. I would have to say I&#x27;m never doing another wax without using this before.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t work for very long, i itch and was looking for something that didn&#x27;t smell or feel greasy and work.  this didn&#x27;t do it for more than a few minutes</li>
            <li> I used this for laser hair removal on my bikini line. Last time I had laser there with ice only it was SO PAINFUL I wasn&#x27;t sure I&#x27;d be able to do it again. This time I used both ice and the Gigi spray and I didn&#x27;t feel a thing. It was incredible!</li>
            <li> At times this product helped me in very \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; areas, but at other times it wasn&#x27;t so effective. I&#x27;ll take any help I can get though!</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t numb completely but definitely takes the Edge off. It really helps with the bikini area. If your looking for something pain free then stick to shaving. :) will keep using!</li>
            <li> Waste of money doesn&#x27;t work, i tried using this product several different times &amp; it just doesn&#x27;t work at all. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend wasting 8$ on it</li>
            <li> Better than using nothing.  It does not make the pain go away, but it does lessen it!  I use it when I use Gigi hard Brazilian wax, so as long as I use the base oil with this spray, I&#x27;m not in agony.</li>
            <li> Not sure it&#x27;s working the way I thought it would.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work - yes your skin feels a little numb when you&#x27;re not doing anything, but it still feels exactly the same when you pull the hair out.  Yikes!</li>
            <li> this is not the same degree of numbing that you would get with a local injection, but as far as a topical spray goes, it is very good. i use it for tattooing and it takes the edge off and does not interfere with the ink/color. i have tried many different things but this one is the most effective (i don&#x27;t really know why but it seems to absorb into the skin while others do not).</li>
            <li> GiGi Honee Anesthetic Numbing Spray. Great product really does seem to help numb the pain. Well worth the the price.</li>
            <li> It is okay, wasn&#x27;t as effective.</li>
            <li> Used this for the first time and it is amazing! I love the smell of the spray and it makes waxing my bikini line much less painful!</li>
            <li> I bought this for resale so I&#x27;m just telling you what my customers say, &amp;#34;I love it.&amp;#34;  The price was low and the delivery was super fast.</li>
            <li> This is like magic!!!! Just love it, if you apply it 10 min before waxing you won&#x27;t even feel so it makes really easy to wax in home</li>
            <li> great stuff also good with cutting toe nails make them nuns</li>
            <li> I really was nervous about getting waxed for the first time (who isnt??!!) but this spray really helped take the sting out and I was in much less pain than my friend who came with me and did not have spray.</li>
            <li> I bought this to help with the discomfort of waxing my legs.  Absolutely no difference in feeling. It smells bad and leaves a slightly oily residue.</li>
            <li> This is a good product it takes away some of the pain from my Brazilian but it smells really bad. Sometimes I just don&#x27;t use it I&#x27;m going to try the no scream cream.</li>
            <li> Very good product to use for waxing my body. I like it very much. I received it very fast and was a good price.</li>
            <li> Didnt work at all, sorry</li>
            <li> If I could have given this item 0 stars I would have.  It didn&#x27;t numb anything at all for me.  Complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> I used this to wax cheast and back before trip did not make skin numb at all. I would look for something else the pain was still awful!!</li>
            <li> Completely worthless.. I also tried the gigi anesthetic numbing spray bought 2 bottles for 10.99 each completely garbage not only does it not work it burns if you try to kill the pain after waxing .. I will never ever buy another cheap product from gigi it smells horrible and does absolutely nothing</li>
            <li> I used to try any over the counter numbing treatment for my brazilian waxes! I finally asked my gyno and she gave me a numbing cream called Emla... IT WORKS!!!</li>
            <li> This works really good, I use it a lot when I use a laser on the leg hairs and bikini line</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT. Simply because it is like a one and only and It really makes it less painful. I use it before I use my epilator&#x27; which is a mechanically hair tweezer that removes hair from the body and this product really helps to lessen the pain a whole lot.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product. Last a long time too. Didn&#x27;t expect it to have as much product for the size of the can.</li>
            <li> Gigi Spray has only 4% lidocaine. Don&#x27;t expect it to numb you like the dentist&#x27;s anesthetic. I spray it once, about 45 minutes before my waxing. See to it that it spreads on your skin, and is not blocked by the hair. After spraying, I rub the area a little bit. It needs to get to the skin. If the hair blocks all the spray, then you will not feel any effect. After half an hour, I spray another coat, making sure that it gets to my skin. Then go for my waxing. Since it stays on the skin level and does not penetrate to the nerves, it does not remove all the pain, but definitely reduces the pain to a large extent. If you need a complete numbing effect, then you have inject yourself with the dentist&#x27;s anesthetic or use some prescription cream, so that the numbness gets down to your nerves.</li>
            <li> This item does not work at all.nor for waxing or for my tattoo work.customers were unsatisfied.</li>
            <li> The product arrived a week before it was supposed to and the product does what it says so I give it 5 stars</li>
            <li> GOOD FOR USE WITH HAIR REMOVAL SYSTEM. EASY TO APPLY CONVENIENT SIZE TO USE WHEN TRAVELING. ALSO GOOD FOR CUTS AND SCRAPES AS THERE IS NO NEED TO TOUCH THE AREA WHEN APPLYING</li>
            <li> i used the spray prior to epilation, however, i was able to feel a considerable amount of discomfort even after multiple applications. the smell is not pleasant either. the spray is greasy also making it difficult to epilate. the spray is expensive for the amount. i would not purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy dosent. work</li>
            <li> It works but it doesn&#x27;t work real well.  I do not recommend this for waxing.</li>
            <li> dont make any this if used it or no the same&lt;br /&gt;sorry about this but i wait 5 m and no make any thing</li>
            <li> Did not work as claimed. You would have a better result if you used dry ice to numb the area.</li>
            <li> This product won&#x27;t make waxing, epilating, or laser hair removal painless. It does take the edge off a little, but only a little. I could go without it and be just as miserable with the hair removal process.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product because there are products that say they are cooling but they use menthol or something that quickly turns warm or even hot! NOT this product, it really is cold when it goes on and stays that way which is important to me and the pain killing ability does work! And it is affordable.</li>
            <li> It has a good smell and worked great for my underarms. It last for about 10 or 15 minutes at most. I literally could not feel the hair being ripped out but be sure your wax is on low. I didn&#x27;t realize how hot mine was until I burned myself</li>
            <li> Good product&lt;br /&gt;Does the job&lt;br /&gt;Will recommend it to others&lt;br /&gt;Good for the price&lt;br /&gt;No problems so far. With it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really work other that to trick my brain into thinking it&#x27;s working and doesn&#x27;t hurt as bad. Not really worth it.</li>
            <li> Okay, I bought this product at a brick and mortar store for underarm waxing.  I asked the lady at the store about it and she didn&#x27;t know anything but did tell me I could bring it back if it didn&#x27;t work.  I bought the tiny can and hoped for the best.  My test was to spray it on my arm and then run my nails over the area to see if there was any difference in the sensation.  Nothing.  I sprayed a larger area and waited.  Same result.  I knew, just from that, that it would do nothing for my underarms, so back to the store I went.  The product sprays out cold from the can. I think the cold is what is supposed to help numb you but it did nothing at all for my skin.</li>
            <li> Personally, I have a high pain tolerance and bought this simply to test as a precaution. I can&#x27;t say that I really noticed it helping though.</li>
            <li> i discovered it a few years back and using it since then.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to numb my skin to remove a skin tag on my thigh.  Not only did it not numb the skin enough for me to cut the tag off but it burned my skin spraying it on.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s work not very well..</li>
            <li> This product does not work at all.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really feel more numb after spraying this on my skin. Maybe it worked, but it was not noticeable. Will not be buying again.</li>
            <li> I wax everything! I have used this on my bikini line and it does take a little bit of the sting out of the waxing process, but not enough to warrant buying the product.  For a first timer getting waxed, I would go ahead and buy this to use in addition to either taking tylenol or motrin one hour before you go to the salon.  For first timers, it is good to have all the help you can get for the \\&quot;pain\\&quot; part of waxing.  It is not that bad though!</li>
            <li> does not numb really at all. nice smell to it however. Also bottle is really small. Get &amp;#34;No Scream Cream&amp;#34; or something with higher percent like 20% active ingredient.</li>
            <li> This product is great. Every time I use the product it does what it is designed to do numb. I feel no pain and will order again.</li>
            <li> Awesome product.  I used other products and it didn&#x27;t help. This product worked good!</li>
            <li> Love it !!!! I bought it to spray the skin around my toenail because I have bad ingrown toenails.  It helped a lot as it is very painful to get the nail out.  Thanks for this great product which I will never run out of !!!!</li>
            <li> The numbing sensation can be felt within a couple of minutes and lasts enough to have your waxing done completely.  It is very easy to use and to carry with you.</li>
            <li> I use it to partially numb my face before derma-needling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hard part is targeting the spray, since the face is such a small area, with very delicate regions, AND it DOES spray as fast as you&#x27;d expect any spray can to spray and it will run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it really DOES cut the edginess out of derma-rolling, without making me so numb that I put on too much pressure and accidentally cause unwanted bleeding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And Boy, did it arrive Quickly!!</li>
            <li> The same day that GiGi Honee Anesthestic Numbing Spray package arrive I had a cut I clean the area where I had the cut and then spray GiGi in the cut it felted like a sting at first but then it calmed the pain while I was doing on myself a few small stitches in the cut.</li>
            <li> Waste of money, it doesn&#x27;t work at all!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel any numbing :(</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work at all! Fell the same pain after it as without using it!</li>
            <li> It was ok. It worked but you have to work fast</li>
            <li> The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was this product! It numbs nothing and I didn&#x27;t realize how small the canister really was. But the service I received from the sender was great and in a timely fashion!</li>
            <li> It is OK, it numbed a little bit, but I have a very low pain threshold. I had to apply it multiple times.</li>
            <li> It works but you must apply generously. It takes a lot of the sting out of waxing, especially in very sensitive areas. It&#x27;s worth having.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well as I&#x27;d hoped. And it only helps the outer layer of skin. It doesn&#x27;t absorb, and if you&#x27;re using it to numb a mosquito bite, you be better off to put nail polish over it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really notice any effect that it had. Luckily this product is so cheap that I didn&#x27;t loose much.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Gigi spray to use on my very sensitive clients ......  It didn&#x27;t seem to help with easing the discomfort of waxing ....  And it seemed to manipulate the areas I was working on causing the wax to not adhere to the skin as good....</li>
            <li> I was really hoping for this to work. It didn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
