            <li>Its spicy and smooth!</li>
            <li>I was expecting more based on reviews that I was reading before buying.</li>
            <li>Its scent lasts for hours which is good if you decide to go out and have fun at night.</li>

            <li>love the product, makes me feel confident</li>
            <li>If you loved the original Cool Water, before they changed the formula, you&#x27;ll love this one.</li>
            <li>Genuine product, great price and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I never saw this cologne in a store before and cool water is one of my most favorite scents..</li>
            <li>Great smell that last all day and night.  </li>
            <li>I received a free gift of deodorant as well.</li>
            <li>I loved it and now being 18 years old</li>
            <li>it is very fresh</li>
            <li>I also get inquiries as to who it is...nice to be unique. ..</li>
            <li>i definitely made a good buy here..</li>
            <li>IF U LIKE COOL WATER</li>
            <li>Great Cologne, wear it everyday.</li>
            <li>I PURCHASED THIS COLONE, WOMEN LOVE THE SMOOTH SMELL AND LAST THROUGHOUT THE DAY AND NOT OVERPOWERING!.</li>
            <li>Strong, masculine scent that lingers all day!</li>
            <li>and i like it Very much</li>
            <li>Great scent and long lasting.</li>
            <li>Better price than buying at the local mall or retail store.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very similar but a bit more</li>
            <li>I think this cologne may be more for a younger guy instead of a middle-aged person.</li>
            <li>Very nice and long lasting</li>
            <li>YOU WILL LOVE THIS AND IS A LITTLE BIT HIGHER IN $, BUT WORTH IT!</li>
            <li>my smell has progressed to wanting a professional clean smell, Idk what the heck</li>
            <li>This is going to be my new cologne for a while!!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s really too soft, and it vanishes quickly.</li>
            <li>He typically wears Cool Water but since our purchase, this is his new favorite.</li>
            <li>Not only did I get it cheaper than duty free by 10 dollars-</li>
            <li>A very nice scent but possibly a little overpowering initially.</li>
            <li>I have had Parada Luna Rosa, Lacoste Pure and some other famous men&#x27;s colognes</li>
            <li>i think it might even kick cool water out of the top spot for my everyday cologne!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely buy more bottles in the future.</li>
            <li>Also box and product were new and sealed as descibed by retailer.  </li>
            <li>Brand new in sealed wrapping.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s s very masculine smell</li>
            <li>Too a chance on this one for my 16 year old.</li>
            <li>When I was about 14 or 15 years old</li>
            <li>I could use this fragrance both as an everyday cologne and for special occasions.</li>
            <li>This is by far the longest lasting scent i had ever owned.</li>

            <li> it sticks to your clothes in a bad way</li>

Never buying this again!!!</li>
            <li> If you loved the original Cool Water, before they changed the formula, you&#x27;ll love this one. It&#x27;s very similar but a bit more spicy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, if you&#x27;re reading this Zino Davidoff, LEAVE THE FORMULA ALONE THIS TIME! Thank you!</li>
            <li> This cologne smells really really good. It&#x27;s s very masculine smell and it last all day !! This is going to be my new cologne for a while!!</li>
            <li> I like the perfume but it&#x27;s really too soft, and it vanishes quickly. Good for people that doesn&#x27;t like strong perfumes.</li>
            <li> Strong, masculine scent that lingers all day! I could use this fragrance both as an everyday cologne and for special occasions. Great winter scent. I&#x27;ll definitely buy more bottles in the future.</li>
            <li> i tried to buy the &amp;#34;Hot&amp;#34; version in stores, like Macy&#x27;s, but they only had the &amp;#34;Cold&amp;#34; version.  I have rec&#x27;d numerous compliments on this version.</li>
            <li> My hubby and I saw this on a cruise and really liked it.  He typically wears Cool Water but since our purchase, this is his new favorite.</li>
