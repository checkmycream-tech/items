    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I was immediately impressed as soon as I applied this to my lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I often mix lipsticks and this is just perfect for that.</li>
            <li>Now if you could just add that berry scent to this lipstick, I might just burst into tears of joy.</li>
            <li>This lipstick is great, but the color is just not my color.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great lipstick.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not deducting stars for the color - that&#x27;s my fault, not the lipstick, but because the texture isn&#x27;t great.  </li>
            <li>and it was a bit bright on her.</li>
            <li>The bright, opaque color reminds me of the colored zinc oxide sunscreen surfers sometimes wear.  </li>
            <li>It goes on creamy, and lasted fairly well.</li>
            <li>I wore this lipstick off and on for about two weeks, to give it a fair trial.  </li>
            <li>The best I can describe it is that it is a light lipstick.  </li>
            <li>She thinks the color is amazing.  </li>
            <li>My wife liked how it feels when applied.  </li>
            <li>The lipstick didn&#x27;t seem to feel all that nice on my lips.</li>
            <li>I like the staying power and this has a nice scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For an inexpensive lipstick</li>
            <li>A bit frosty for my tastes, though my husband liked it.  </li>
            <li>It also smells nice.</li>
            <li>This is not the absolute best lipstick of my experience.  </li>
            <li>Maybe, if I liked the shade.</li>
            <li>It reminds me of the Rose shade from the limited-edition Nyx Macaron Lippies.  </li>
            <li>It could be that a darker color would provide better coverage, but honestly I think it has to do with the consistency of the lipstick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Simply put, this Maybelline lipstick is the best drugstore brand lipstick I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>My skin is light and warm, and this did clash a bit with my skin tone... and</li>
            <li>It went on more like paste and had a sticky feeling to it.</li>
            <li>The color was lighter than anticipated, but it works well with something else on top.</li>
            <li>It is not metallic which I find much more flattering.</li>
            <li>This is a brand I trust and that has been around for more years that I care to admit to.</li>
            <li>I am more of a brown girl myself.</li>
            <li>case is cute.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The lipsticks applies smoothly with a pleasant scent that fades quickly.  </li>
            <li>Pretty good, when paired with a lipgloss.  </li>
            <li>, this is pretty good stuff.</li>
            <li>However, it is pretty good.  </li>
            <li>A very beautiful pink lipstick!</li>
            <li>have other Maybelline lipsticks and have always been impressed by them as &amp;#34;drugstore&amp;#34; brand lipsticks go, but this one just doesn&#x27;t cut it.</li>
            <li>Sometimes lipstick has a waxy or chemical smell, but this had a sophisticated and clean smell.</li>
            <li>The description says it is &amp;#34;super saturated in pigment&amp;#34; and that couldn&#x27;t be more true.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and stays on for quite a while.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice product, though no Maybelline product is priced as reasonably as they used to be.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t particularly care for it, but my daughter liked it.  </li>
            <li>I like the rich creamy texture of this lip stick.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Unlike many other lipsticks, this has a pleasant smell and taste.  </li>
            <li>lipstick has a nice quality to it, and I definitely plan to buy more Maybelline products.</li>
            <li>But honestly, I can get this same effect with a ChapStix in cherry...and it would look better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad, just nothing special.</li>
            <li>Overall, a dependable lipstick, good day-time color.</li>
            <li>It is true to the color of the cap.</li>
            <li>and it has a fabulously sweet smell.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It feels good on the lips similar to a lip balm.  </li>
            <li>First, the packaging for this lipstick looks and feels cheap, like I&#x27;d bought something from the Wet-n-Wild brand rather than</li>
            <li>The lipstick does stay on for a long time and feels good like it is moisturizing my lips.</li>
            <li>I liked the product more when I used it with a dark lip liner.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Those looking for a bright pastel pink without the purple undertones might try Butter London Lippy in Alcopop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It goes on really soft and smooth and lasts!  </li>
            <li>I blotted to get it more natural looking.  </li>
            <li>I like mine more natural looking.</li>
            <li>Nevertheless, I thought this lipstick WAS sensational, and I would absolutely consider buying it again in a different color.</li>
            <li>If you need a bright Barbie pink in your life then go for it!</li>
            <li>(right now),</li>
            <li>The lipstick itself has a vibrant color, but it doesn&#x27;t go on smoothly or show up well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was delighted with the feel, texture and lasting qualities of Maybelline New York Color Rebel Bloom lipstick.</li>
            <li>Perhaps this color would be more striking on one with a very dark complexion.</li>
            <li>Because of the light pink color, it is probably better worn in the summer (or when you have a tan).  </li>
            <li>more so my hair (which is very red right now)</li>
            <li>/&gt;The scent is different from most lipsticks.  </li>
            <li>will note, however, that the color &amp;#34;Petal Pink&amp;#34; would likely flatter a cool-skinned person more.</li>
            <li>Staying power wasn&#x27;t great - slowly faded throughout the day, if I had anything to eat or drink, it was gone.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many lipsticks that have had the opposite effect.</li>
            <li>It makes for a fun and modern look!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Prime your lips first as this shade highlights chapped lips.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also somewhat patchy and will settle into the lines of your lips; I recommend using either primer or liner first with this shade.  </li>
            <li>I do love that I can apply this light color over (or under) a darker lipstick to tone it down.</li>
            <li>color would probably work best when applied over a slightly darker pink</li>
            <li>Nice quality and a true vivid pink</li>
            <li>Other than that, the lipstick itself is amazing.</li>
            <li>nice color for those looking for light pinks (which are sometimes hard to find).  </li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s hard to rub your lips together to kind of smooth the color.  </li>
            <li>Petal Pink is a bright pastel pink with strong purple undertones.  </li>
            <li>Overall, this is a fun shade and complements my light skin tone.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s very light in color and could possibly benefit with some high shine gloss on top.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not quite sure if it tastes similar to anything in particular, but it is quite inoffensive.  </li>
            <li>I usually don&#x27;t wear pinkish lipsticks because they don&#x27;t complement my skin color (very fair with yellow undertones with platinum hair).</li>
            <li>This is a true light pink ...</li>
            <li>I have other lipsticks that, in the tube, appear to be a somewhat similar color, and with the right makeup and clothes, I can pull them off, but this color just didn&#x27;t look good with anything.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have fair skin and this pale pink lipstick, which has a matte finish, glides easily on my lips and feels moisturizing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was very unimpressed with this product.</li>
            <li>She doesn&#x27;t really care for the color, which does not favor her complexion.  </li>
            <li>This is a much brighter lipstick than what it seems like in the tube - almost a neon-ish color.</li>
            <li>This product makes me wonder why I used to pay so much for name-brand cosmetics.  </li>
            <li>Makes you look like a more pink version of Dave Chappelle.</li>
            <li>Pretty typical Maybelline- color went on pretty smoothly.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and is a bright, yet subtle pink.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s back to bold reds for this gal.</li>
            <li>30.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But my main gripe is the formula.</li>
            <li>The bitter taste with a touch of cheap perfume thrown in reminds me of the  &amp;#34;lipsticks&amp;#34; in my childhood toy make-up kits.</li>
            <li>Color was definitely a light pink.  </li>
            <li>I think the color would be lovely on a blue eyed blond with pale skin though, and also appropriate for a young teen.</li>
            <li>This is long lasting and feels good on my lips and doesn&#x27;t dry them at all.</li>
            <li>This particular lipstick, in the Petal Pink shade, does not stand out as radically different than most others that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I like the color of this New York Lipstick by Maybelline</li>
            <li>Surely it works on some shade of skin, but I&#x27;m not sure what that would be.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will have to be careful not to go full Barbie with</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a little light.</li>
            <li>It also requires at least two coats to really show off the color and not make your lips look lightly frosted.  </li>
            <li>The texture is soft, but it doesn&#x27;t go on evenly without some effort.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Makes my lips feel soft and silky.  </li>
            <li>Now it&#x27;s like my natural lip tone.</li>
            <li>The supersaturated color sits upon your lips rather than allowing your natural lip color to shine through.  </li>
            <li>If it had shine and some shimmer, I would love it but that is the only thing missing for me.  </li>
            <li>but if I were you I&#x27;d spend an extra couple bucks and get a Maybelline (or other brand) lipstick that doesn&#x27;t look and feel like a cheap knock-off.</li>
            <li>This particular shade was very Barbie pink.</li>
            <li>I wish, however, that the lipstick would be less sheer and have more lasting color.  </li>
            <li>The shade works well for me a deep true pink.</li>
            <li>It does not run into those tiny cracks and furrows that normally makes the lipstick line fuzzy.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would be interested to try the other colors of the line.</li>
            <li>Rather than gliding on smoothly, this lipstick felt waxy to me in an unpleasant way and did not go on easily.</li>
            <li>color appears to be geared more for young girls than women because of its pale pink; however, I like it enough that I would purchase this when the tube runs out.</li>
            <li>It barely covered my lips; the comparatively darker color of my lips showed through the lipstick and gave my mouth a blotchy look, even after applying it to my lips 2-3 times.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hardly an expert when it comes to makeup, but I have tried several brands, including Maybelline, but nothing else I&#x27;ve tried was as smooth and pigmented as this.</li>
            <li>The color was decent, maybe it was a bit too pink.</li>
            <li>This is a vibrant pink shade.  </li>
            <li>The color last for a few hours or until a meal fading evenly into a light pink stain.</li>
            <li>doing strange makeup looks so it will get some rotation, but it is definitely not an everyday color.  </li>

            <li> This product makes me wonder why I used to pay so much for name-brand cosmetics.  </li>
            <li> Makes you look like a more pink version of Dave Chappelle.</li>
            <li> Pretty typical Maybelline- color went on pretty smoothly.  </li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and is a bright, yet subtle pink.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s back to bold reds for this gal.</li>
            <li> 30.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But my main gripe is the formula.</li>
            <li> The bitter taste with a touch of cheap perfume thrown in reminds me of the  &amp;#34;lipsticks&amp;#34; in my childhood toy make-up kits.</li>
            <li> Color was definitely a light pink.  </li>
            <li> I think the color would be lovely on a blue eyed blond with pale skin though, and also appropriate for a young teen.</li>
            <li> This is long lasting and feels good on my lips and doesn&#x27;t dry them at all.</li>
            <li> This particular lipstick, in the Petal Pink shade, does not stand out as radically different than most others that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I like the color of this New York Lipstick by Maybelline</li>
            <li> Surely it works on some shade of skin, but I&#x27;m not sure what that would be.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will have to be careful not to go full Barbie with</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a little light.</li>
            <li> It also requires at least two coats to really show off the color and not make your lips look lightly frosted.  </li>
            <li> The texture is soft, but it doesn&#x27;t go on evenly without some effort.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Makes my lips feel soft and silky.  </li>
            <li> Now it&#x27;s like my natural lip tone.</li>
            <li> The supersaturated color sits upon your lips rather than allowing your natural lip color to shine through.  </li>
            <li> If it had shine and some shimmer, I would love it but that is the only thing missing for me.  </li>
            <li> but if I were you I&#x27;d spend an extra couple bucks and get a Maybelline (or other brand) lipstick that doesn&#x27;t look and feel like a cheap knock-off.</li>
            <li> This particular shade was very Barbie pink.</li>
            <li> I wish, however, that the lipstick would be less sheer and have more lasting color.  </li>
            <li> The shade works well for me a deep true pink.</li>
            <li> It does not run into those tiny cracks and furrows that normally makes the lipstick line fuzzy.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would be interested to try the other colors of the line.</li>
            <li> Rather than gliding on smoothly, this lipstick felt waxy to me in an unpleasant way and did not go on easily.</li>
            <li> color appears to be geared more for young girls than women because of its pale pink; however, I like it enough that I would purchase this when the tube runs out.</li>
            <li> It barely covered my lips; the comparatively darker color of my lips showed through the lipstick and gave my mouth a blotchy look, even after applying it to my lips 2-3 times.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hardly an expert when it comes to makeup, but I have tried several brands, including Maybelline, but nothing else I&#x27;ve tried was as smooth and pigmented as this.</li>
            <li> The color was decent, maybe it was a bit too pink.</li>
            <li> This is a vibrant pink shade.  </li>
            <li> The color last for a few hours or until a meal fading evenly into a light pink stain.</li>
            <li> doing strange makeup looks so it will get some rotation, but it is definitely not an everyday color.  </li>
            <li> My normal lip color is darker and this looks odd next to my skin tone.</li>
            <li> My first mascara was Maybelline - a little red box with a tiny brush and you had to wet the mascara in order to apply it.</li>
            <li> The color doesn&#x27;t last long, so it will need to be applied throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It seems to last a long time and does not have the &amp;#34;funny taste&amp;#34; that some lipsticks can have.</li>
            <li> This bold pale pink lipstick with a tinge of lilac does not give the typical hint of color</li>
            <li> This particular color is a pale pink on the lips.</li>
            <li> It seemed to apply pretty chalky, and even though I had to do a few swipes to build up product, it was streaky and uneven on my lips.</li>
            <li> Not like other brands such as Japonesque.</li>
            <li> Maybelline, we&#x27;ve come a long way baby!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s creamy and moisturizers my lips well even in the dry winter weather.  </li>
            <li> It does not go on moist, therefore you see all the lines in your lips (if they are dry at all).  </li>
            <li> A bit chalky, but my lips were a bit dry, too, so take that into account.  </li>
            <li> The color is a pastel pale pink, lighter on than it appears in the picture - pretty, matte color, but doesn&#x27;t really work with my coloring unfortunately.  </li>
            <li> Lastly, I find the color a bit odd.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lighter than my actual lips and looks a bit odd.</li>
            <li> It feels very dry on my lips, and although the color didn&#x27;t fade in the hour</li>
            <li> This petal pink Maybelline lipstick does nothing for</li>
            <li> did like the the pink case, but I just can&#x27;t recommend the lipstick at all.</li>
            <li> MilkMaid&#x27;s Pixie Pink.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really the most horrible color of lipstick I&#x27;ve ever tried.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is not a very wearable color, especially if you have pale skin.  </li>
            <li> The pink is VERY pink.</li>
            <li> so it didn&#x27;t add a pretty sheen - just a weird finish.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wear other Maybelline lipsticks in the Nude category, so I am a fan.</li>
            <li> But at this price point, I&#x27;d probably shop around the other brands too.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received petal pink to try, which I don&#x27;t think worked with my dark hair and eyes.  </li>
            <li> (that might be a little too dark for your taste), which is what I ended up doing.</li>
            <li> one complaint about this lipstick is that it a dry lipstick.  </li>
            <li> Not a true pink; hard to describe</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be looking for other colors of this one!!</li>
            <li> so pink that it was sort of hard to look at.  </li>
            <li> formula is not fabulous.  </li>
            <li> The sheer I don&#x27;t mind as long as it was a consistent sheerness but the splotchiness is disgusting looking.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, a mere few hours after application, after only sipping water from a glass, the color has disappeared.</li>
            <li> Not many people can pull off this color, I don&#x27;t think.</li>
            <li> There was very little gloss to the lipstick; it was rather dull.</li>
            <li> I have very pale, rosy skin, and this color did not work on me at all.  </li>
            <li> The color, however, is very pale, not at all flattering to me.</li>
            <li> Of course, girls that age can get away with just about anything without looking ridiculous, but adults should be advised that there are a lot complexions which will not be complemented by this shade.  </li>
            <li> So it isn&#x27;t TERRIBLE, but certainly not a product I would wear again or purchase in the future.</li>
            <li> (is that weird?).</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Worst of all, it tastes terrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This petal pink Maybelline lipstick does nothing for me.&lt;br /&gt;In fact, except for a bit of shine it seems to make my lips disappear.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely not for anyone with a rosy complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s back to bold reds for this gal.</li>
            <li> Rather than gliding on smoothly, this lipstick felt waxy to me in an unpleasant way and did not go on easily. It barely covered my lips; the comparatively darker color of my lips showed through the lipstick and gave my mouth a blotchy look, even after applying it to my lips 2-3 times. There was very little gloss to the lipstick; it was rather dull. Worst of all, it tastes terrible. The bitter taste with a touch of cheap perfume thrown in reminds me of the  &amp;#34;lipsticks&amp;#34; in my childhood toy make-up kits. Lastly, I find the color a bit odd. Not a true pink; hard to describe but it&#x27;s a bit murky. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> A very beautiful pink lipstick! It goes on really soft and smooth and lasts!  I&#x27;ll be looking for other colors of this one!!</li>
            <li> I have very pale, rosy skin, and this color did not work on me at all.  I have other lipsticks that, in the tube, appear to be a somewhat similar color, and with the right makeup and clothes, I can pull them off, but this color just didn&#x27;t look good with anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I gave it to my daughter to try.  She has medium skin that leans towards olive, but it didn&#x27;t work on her, either.  She looked like a lifeguard with zinc oxide on her lips.  It&#x27;s really the most horrible color of lipstick I&#x27;ve ever tried.  Surely it works on some shade of skin, but I&#x27;m not sure what that would be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is different from most lipsticks.  I didn&#x27;t particularly care for it, but my daughter liked it.  The texture is soft, but it doesn&#x27;t go on evenly without some effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did like the the pink case, but I just can&#x27;t recommend the lipstick at all.</li>
            <li> My wife says that it goes on like a lipgloss but looks like lipstick. She loves how it made her lips feel.</li>
            <li> Since this was an Amazon Vine product, I didn&#x27;t get to select the color - so my review will not be a reflection of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I didn&#x27;t like about this lip color was the coverage. I could still see my lips underneath the lipstick, if that makes sense? It was almost like a tinted lip gloss, but with the texture of a lipstick so it didn&#x27;t add a pretty sheen - just a weird finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very unimpressed with this product. It could be that a darker color would provide better coverage, but honestly I think it has to do with the consistency of the lipstick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must admit that I did like the smell of the lipstick (is that weird?). Sometimes lipstick has a waxy or chemical smell, but this had a sophisticated and clean smell. So it isn&#x27;t TERRIBLE, but certainly not a product I would wear again or purchase in the future.</li>
            <li> As the one man in the household, I didn&#x27;t get this for myself, but for my wife &amp; 11-year-old daughter.  The judgment is mixed.  My wife liked how it feels when applied.  She doesn&#x27;t really care for the color, which does not favor her complexion.  My daughter, to nobody&#x27;s surprise, applied it as only a pre-teen girl can do &amp; emerged with lips so pink that it was sort of hard to look at.  Of course, girls that age can get away with just about anything without looking ridiculous, but adults should be advised that there are a lot complexions which will not be complemented by this shade.  Just one guy&#x27;s opinion.</li>
            <li> Nice quality and a true vivid pink</li>
            <li> First, the packaging for this lipstick looks and feels cheap, like I&#x27;d bought something from the Wet-n-Wild brand rather than Maybelline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have other Maybelline lipsticks and have always been impressed by them as &amp;#34;drugstore&amp;#34; brand lipsticks go, but this one just doesn&#x27;t cut it. The lipstick itself has a vibrant color, but it doesn&#x27;t go on smoothly or show up well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure it&#x27;s only $5-ish (right now), but if I were you I&#x27;d spend an extra couple bucks and get a Maybelline (or other brand) lipstick that doesn&#x27;t look and feel like a cheap knock-off.</li>
            <li> Simply put, this Maybelline lipstick is the best drugstore brand lipstick I&#x27;ve ever tried. I&#x27;m hardly an expert when it comes to makeup, but I have tried several brands, including Maybelline, but nothing else I&#x27;ve tried was as smooth and pigmented as this. The description says it is &amp;#34;super saturated in pigment&amp;#34; and that couldn&#x27;t be more true. I was immediately impressed as soon as I applied this to my lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will note, however, that the color &amp;#34;Petal Pink&amp;#34; would likely flatter a cool-skinned person more. My skin is light and warm, and this did clash a bit with my skin tone... and more so my hair (which is very red right now) Nevertheless, I thought this lipstick WAS sensational, and I would absolutely consider buying it again in a different color.</li>
            <li> The color was decent, maybe it was a bit too pink. The lipstick didn&#x27;t seem to feel all that nice on my lips. It went on more like paste and had a sticky feeling to it. Not like other brands such as Japonesque. I had to wipe it off it just felt sticky.</li>
            <li> This is a much brighter lipstick than what it seems like in the tube - almost a neon-ish color. It seemed to apply pretty chalky, and even though I had to do a few swipes to build up product, it was streaky and uneven on my lips. Staying power wasn&#x27;t great - slowly faded throughout the day, if I had anything to eat or drink, it was gone. For a fair-skinned redhead, this color did not seem to go well with my complexion at all.</li>
            <li> Pretty good, when paired with a lipgloss.  The color was lighter than anticipated, but it works well with something else on top.</li>
            <li> The color of this lipstick reminds me of a long-discontinued lipstick I craved when I was a teenager: MilkMaid&#x27;s Pixie Pink. It goes on smoothly and is a bright, yet subtle pink. I usually don&#x27;t wear pinkish lipsticks because they don&#x27;t complement my skin color (very fair with yellow undertones with platinum hair). I was delighted with the feel, texture and lasting qualities of Maybelline New York Color Rebel Bloom lipstick. It is not metallic which I find much more flattering. I wear other Maybelline lipsticks in the Nude category, so I am a fan. This is a brand I trust and that has been around for more years that I care to admit to. My first mascara was Maybelline - a little red box with a tiny brush and you had to wet the mascara in order to apply it. Maybelline, we&#x27;ve come a long way baby! Now if you could just add that berry scent to this lipstick, I might just burst into tears of joy.</li>
            <li> This lipstick is great, but the color is just not my color. The pink is VERY pink. I am more of a brown girl myself. Other than that, the lipstick itself is amazing.</li>
            <li> This is a vibrant pink shade.  It goes on smoothly and stays on for quite a while.  It&#x27;s creamy and moisturizers my lips well even in the dry winter weather.  Overall, this is a fun shade and complements my light skin tone.</li>
            <li> I like the color of this New York Lipstick by Maybelline but it&#x27;s a little light. The lipstick does stay on for a long time and feels good like it is moisturizing my lips. My daughter tried this and immediately asked for it, she is a teen. I like the staying power and this has a nice scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For an inexpensive lipstick, this is pretty good stuff. This particular color is a pale pink on the lips. It&#x27;s pretty but it&#x27;s very light in color and could possibly benefit with some high shine gloss on top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would be interested to try the other colors of the line. This is long lasting and feels good on my lips and doesn&#x27;t dry them at all.</li>
            <li> This is a true light pink ... nice color for those looking for light pinks (which are sometimes hard to find).  Because of the light pink color, it is probably better worn in the summer (or when you have a tan).  It does not make your lips pop, or stand out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one complaint about this lipstick is that it a dry lipstick.  It does not go on moist, therefore you see all the lines in your lips (if they are dry at all).  Also, it&#x27;s hard to rub your lips together to kind of smooth the color.  One workaround is to apply a gloss or moisturizing lip balm prior to applying the lipstick.  The color doesn&#x27;t last long, so it will need to be applied throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This color would probably work best when applied over a slightly darker pink (that might be a little too dark for your taste), which is what I ended up doing.</li>
            <li> Pretty typical Maybelline- color went on pretty smoothly.  A bit chalky, but my lips were a bit dry, too, so take that into account.  Color was definitely a light pink.  A bit frosty for my tastes, though my husband liked it.  I blotted to get it more natural looking.  Overall, a dependable lipstick, good day-time color.</li>
            <li> I have fair skin and this pale pink lipstick, which has a matte finish, glides easily on my lips and feels moisturizing. If it had shine and some shimmer, I would love it but that is the only thing missing for me.  I do love that I can apply this light color over (or under) a darker lipstick to tone it down. I often mix lipsticks and this is just perfect for that. I also like this as a summertime color for my lips when I tend to wear lighter lipsticks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color appears to be geared more for young girls than women because of its pale pink; however, I like it enough that I would purchase this when the tube runs out. It also smells nice.</li>
            <li> This is not the absolute best lipstick of my experience.  However, it is pretty good.  It does not clump.  It is true to the color of the cap. It goes on creamy, and lasted fairly well.</li>
            <li> This is a nice product, though no Maybelline product is priced as reasonably as they used to be. This particular lipstick, in the Petal Pink shade, does not stand out as radically different than most others that I&#x27;ve used. It&#x27;s not bad, just nothing special. The color, however, is very pale, not at all flattering to me. Would I buy something from this line? Maybe, if I liked the shade. But at this price point, I&#x27;d probably shop around the other brands too.</li>
            <li> This product makes me wonder why I used to pay so much for name-brand cosmetics.  It&#x27;s a great lipstick.  I like its texture and it has a fabulously sweet smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the shine on the lipstick.  I wish, however, that the lipstick would be less sheer and have more lasting color.  I liked the product more when I used it with a dark lip liner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lipstick has a nice quality to it, and I definitely plan to buy more Maybelline products.</li>
            <li> The color is a pastel pale pink, lighter on than it appears in the picture - pretty, matte color, but doesn&#x27;t really work with my coloring unfortunately.  I&#x27;m not deducting stars for the color - that&#x27;s my fault, not the lipstick, but because the texture isn&#x27;t great.  It feels very dry on my lips, and although the color didn&#x27;t fade in the hour I wore it, it did feel like it got drier and drier as time went on.</li>
            <li> I like the rich creamy texture of this lip stick.  The shade works well for me a deep true pink. Makes my lips feel soft and silky.  I let my daughter who is lighter skinned try it and it was a bit bright on her. I would suggest it for medium skint ton... just so it is not electric on you. Unless that is how you like your lipstick. I like mine more natural looking.</li>
            <li> This pink is far paler once applied than it appears in the photo. It&#x27;s lighter than my actual lips and looks a bit odd. Perhaps this color would be more striking on one with a very dark complexion. Not many people can pull off this color, I don&#x27;t think. My normal lip color is darker and this looks odd next to my skin tone. (I am a medium in makeup.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, a mere few hours after application, after only sipping water from a glass, the color has disappeared. Now it&#x27;s like my natural lip tone. I can no longer see the color but I still feel the moisture, the conditioning the lipstick is providing so I know it is still there. The color just fades fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I do like is as I mentioned above: my lips feel moisturized. I&#x27;ve tried many lipsticks that have had the opposite effect. Whatever they put in this stuff...while they could def improve on the color duration, I do like the way the lipstick feels. But honestly, I can get this same effect with a ChapStix in cherry...and it would look better.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this.  She thinks the color is amazing.  According to her, it seems to moisturize her lips.  It does not run into those tiny cracks and furrows that normally makes the lipstick line fuzzy.  It seems to last a long time and does not have the &amp;#34;funny taste&amp;#34; that some lipsticks can have.</li>
            <li> I wore this lipstick off and on for about two weeks, to give it a fair trial.  The best I can describe it is that it is a light lipstick.  It&#x27;s not shinny or sticky like a gloss, it is not sheer, but the coverage is lighter than a regular lipstick.  I found that is lasts for just an hour or two, but that might also because I didn&#x27;t use lip primer or anything underneath the lipstick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike many other lipsticks, this has a pleasant smell and taste.  I&#x27;m not quite sure if it tastes similar to anything in particular, but it is quite inoffensive.  I like the color of the case a lot, it is a pearly, pink-purple that stands out in your cosmetic case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received petal pink to try, which I don&#x27;t think worked with my dark hair and eyes.  I think the color would be lovely on a blue eyed blond with pale skin though, and also appropriate for a young teen.</li>
            <li> This bold pale pink lipstick with a tinge of lilac does not give the typical hint of color I&#x27;ve come to expect from pastel shades.  The supersaturated color sits upon your lips rather than allowing your natural lip color to shine through.  The bright, opaque color reminds me of the colored zinc oxide sunscreen surfers sometimes wear.  It makes for a fun and modern look!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lipsticks applies smoothly with a pleasant scent that fades quickly.  It feels good on the lips similar to a lip balm.  Prime your lips first as this shade highlights chapped lips.  The color last for a few hours or until a meal fading evenly into a light pink stain.</li>
            <li> Petal Pink is a bright pastel pink with strong purple undertones.  It reminds me of the Rose shade from the limited-edition Nyx Macaron Lippies.  Those looking for a bright pastel pink without the purple undertones might try Butter London Lippy in Alcopop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not a very wearable color, especially if you have pale skin.  It could, however, be used in a very specific look.  I recommend it for people with cool-toned skin.  I do like doing strange makeup looks so it will get some rotation, but it is definitely not an everyday color.  I will have to be careful not to go full Barbie with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The formula is not fabulous.  It lasts four hours (with fading), but will not last a meal.  It&#x27;s also somewhat patchy and will settle into the lines of your lips; I recommend using either primer or liner first with this shade.  It also requires at least two coats to really show off the color and not make your lips look lightly frosted.  The formula is hydrating, which is a bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The case is cute.  I like that Maybelline went for something kicky instead of imitating prestige cosmetics.</li>
            <li> This particular shade was very Barbie pink. It did nothing for my complexion. NC 30.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But my main gripe is the formula. This is sheer and splotchy. Makes you look like a more pink version of Dave Chappelle. Did not like this formula at all. If you need a bright Barbie pink in your life then go for it! But I would definitely try a different brand or formula. The sheer I don&#x27;t mind as long as it was a consistent sheerness but the splotchiness is disgusting looking. Not a fan.</li>
