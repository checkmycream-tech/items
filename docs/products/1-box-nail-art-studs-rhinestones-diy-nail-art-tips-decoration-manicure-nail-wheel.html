            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>love them!</li>
            <li>Love these!  </li>
            <li>and I also do my own nails.</li>
            <li>These are so nice</li>
            <li>Love these rhinestones, plenty of them for the money, they are sparkly and cute!</li>
            <li>The price is amazing and the case they come in is so cute.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s happy and that&#x27;s all that really matters.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t spill and you can turn the top to select your color.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re okay</li>
            <li>I am so glad I purchased these.</li>
            <li>got this to bling a phone cover for my sister, i cant find one for her phone already done, great price and fast shipping</li>
            <li>I love the deal, but when I cover the gems on my nail with a top coat, they lose some of their shine.</li>
            <li>My niece will love these rhinestones.</li>
            <li>It saves me the headache of spilling more rhinestones than I need.</li>
            <li>l hope more item like this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve use them a couple of times and love the results.  </li>
            <li>I love the color variety</li>
            <li>They are okay</li>
            <li>The manufacturer needs to come up with a better way of closing the container.</li>
            <li>and I love all the colors.</li>
            <li>Shine on:)</li>
            <li>They are great and cheap and it shipped fast!</li>
            <li>I love all the colors and sparkles they are easy to put on with the pencil thing.</li>
            <li>because it&#x27;s a very good product, you only get about 1/3 of what you ordered.</li>
            <li>and these were the perfect size for what i wanted nice and small</li>
            <li>Easy placement.  </li>
            <li>Bling Bling liked very much</li>
            <li>Just got in the mail today and it doesnt look as filled as it does in the picture.</li>
            <li>Maybe I don&#x27;t get it right how to put it on but even after watching YouTube videos on how to stick these rhinestones they don&#x27;t stay on for more than 5-10 mins...</li>
            <li>Good selection, but stones are too big</li>
            <li>and they stay on for a good amount of time with a little glue and a top coat.</li>
            <li>One is that the rhinestones fall off quickly.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, they are very pretty and sparkly.</li>
            <li>, just make sure you buy a tool to put them on with, and you have to use clear nail polish.</li>
            <li>Such a nice variety of colors and shapes and sizes</li>
            <li>and i put them on my natural nails with a top coat</li>
            <li>It was my first time alone shopping in Amazon, was easy and fast.</li>
            <li>Product was shipped quickly and it looks exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li>To be fair, I do use a very thick top coat</li>
            <li>Came pretty quick, fast shipping, packaged well.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>so i can only go with what she says :)</li>
            <li>These are exactly like the ones we get at a nail salon.  </li>
            <li>These are so pretty</li>
            <li>and I would certainly recommend these to anyone who likes to do nail art.</li>
            <li>There really isn&#x27;t much else that can be said about them.  </li>
            <li>The product is very neatly packaged and there are a ton of each color</li>
            <li>2MM are VERY SMALLLLLLLL</li>
            <li>I enjoy the fact that the rhinestones are divided and can only come out one color at a time.  </li>
            <li>The product was shipped fast and was just as described on the site.</li>
            <li>I dont really care though</li>
            <li>Some of the companies have been sending me half full things to where the photo doesn&#x27;t match what was being advertised, but this wheel came pretty full and matched the photo that was displayed.</li>
            <li>I used some right away on a birthday card I made for a young lady</li>
            <li>Nice and small what i was looking for.  </li>
            <li>Pay was a littlw more difficult, but is ok.</li>
            <li>liket it for the summer, enjoy the different colors, and are easy to put on if you have the right tool, otherwise they are hard to manage.  </li>
            <li>Cute little nail diamonds.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect size</li>
            <li>Next time I will let my nails dry then dot either top coat or nail glue with a toothpick onto my nail then apply the gem with no topcoat.</li>
            <li>They are really small but they okay for the price.</li>
            <li>They are really too big to be used for nail art.</li>
            <li>the wheel is very convenient when you are doing different mail designs.</li>
            <li>Go from trendy to classic to flashy with the addition or subtraction of these rhinestones.</li>
            <li>You seriously get more rhinestones than you will ever need.</li>
            <li>Rhinestones usually shine in the light but these ones didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>This was everything i expected and arrived 10 days before the estimated arrival date, I&#x27;m very please with this product.</li>
            <li>I liked all the colors it came with, some pearls were in the wrong set</li>
            <li>I put on a topcoat but they still fall off in the first few hours.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Some lasted two days but that wasn&#x27;t long enough.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not expecting these to last on my nails for too long so this method should suffice.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money and time on these...they are useless if doing it on your own nails</li>
            <li> It took a long time to receive.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this product especially for your little princess</li>
            <li> size of the product made it difficult to use and hard to put more than one on each finger without looking too bulky.</li>
            <li> I did use them on a few Christmas cards, but again very tiny to work with.  </li>
            <li> Also, these rhinestones don&#x27;t shimmer as brightly as I expected.</li>
            <li> but just not what I expected.</li>
            <li> but it arrived around when expected.</li>
            <li> Product was as expected.  </li>
            <li> Minimal required to apply.</li>
            <li> but I expected it but other than that I like the product Ive ordered them before</li>
            <li> but other</li>
            <li> but there is defiantly not 1200 in the little package it comes in.</li>
            <li> I ordered two of them (20 pcs) and there were literally hundreds of little sparkly pieces everywhere.</li>
            <li> there were just a few.</li>
            <li> arrived a little late</li>
            <li> No more purchasing these rinestones from sallys which is twice the price.</li>
            <li> They are a bit hard to get used to</li>
            <li> These stones are so delicate and sparkly...</li>
            <li> The jewels are very small.  </li>
            <li> There is nothing bad about this... especially when you look at the price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s bad enough it took a while to get to me.</li>
            <li> I was afraid at the purchase that it was being shipped from another country other than the us</li>
            <li> It was horrible.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Just what I was looking for. The shipping toke awhile but other then that this is what I was looking for. No more purchasing these rinestones from sallys which is twice the price. LOVE THESE!!!!</li>
            <li> I got the rhinestones ahead of time and I like the size of them but there is defiantly not 1200 in the little package it comes in.</li>
            <li> Good selection, but stones are too big</li>
            <li> The rhinestones were perfect! Great variety of colors and amount of gems for the price.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product to a friend!</li>
            <li> There really isn&#x27;t much else that can be said about them.  My daughter is into nail art and I bought them for her.  She&#x27;s happy and that&#x27;s all that really matters.</li>
            <li> I liked all the colors it came with, some pearls were in the wrong set but it&#x27;s no biggie there were just a few.</li>
            <li> You seriously get more rhinestones than you will ever need. They are small which is exactly what I wanted. It doesn&#x27;t spill and you can turn the top to select your color. There is nothing bad about this... especially when you look at the price. Keep in mind, it will take a while to be delivered.</li>
            <li> It took a long time to receive.  The jewels are very small.  I know they are for nail art.  I bought them to use for crafting on cards and scrapbook pages.  I did use them on a few Christmas cards, but again very tiny to work with.  Otherwise, they are very pretty and sparkly.</li>
            <li> I bought these and they came four days later. There are two problems with this. One is that the rhinestones fall off quickly. I put on a topcoat but they still fall off in the first few hours. Some lasted two days but that wasn&#x27;t long enough. Also, these rhinestones don&#x27;t shimmer as brightly as I expected. Rhinestones usually shine in the light but these ones didn&#x27;t. They&#x27;re okay but just not what I expected.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described. Excellent quality.</li>
            <li> Cute little nail diamonds.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect size, just make sure you buy a tool to put them on with, and you have to use clear nail polish.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I purchased these. They are a bit hard to get used to but once you do they are amazing and look beautiful on many nail designs.&lt;br /&gt;I love them!</li>
            <li> Not as shiny as I would like but they still work great for nail art.  Taking what I paid for them into perspective, they are excellent :)</li>
            <li> arrived a little late but I expected it but other than that I like the product Ive ordered them before and they are as described.</li>
            <li> Bling Bling liked very much</li>
            <li> got this to bling a phone cover for my sister, i cant find one for her phone already done, great price and fast shipping</li>
            <li> The product is very neatly packaged and there are a ton of each color but they were a lot bigger than expected.&lt;br /&gt;The size of the product made it difficult to use and hard to put more than one on each finger without looking too bulky.</li>
            <li> For some reason, in the picture the gems look bigger then they are in reality. Still a good product but ALOT SMALLER then they come across!! 2MM are VERY SMALLLLLLLL</li>
            <li> my wife loves these nail tips she cant stop switching her nail lol i guess they are great . i dont do nails so i can only go with what she says :)</li>
            <li> I love the deal, but when I cover the gems on my nail with a top coat, they lose some of their shine. To be fair, I do use a very thick top coat so it totally blankets the gem. Next time I will let my nails dry then dot either top coat or nail glue with a toothpick onto my nail then apply the gem with no topcoat. I&#x27;m not expecting these to last on my nails for too long so this method should suffice.</li>
            <li> My niece will love these rhinestones. She loves designing nails. Such a nice variety of colors and shapes and sizes</li>
            <li> I enjoy the fact that the rhinestones are divided and can only come out one color at a time.  It saves me the headache of spilling more rhinestones than I need.</li>
            <li> All kinds of colors to go with any outfit or look that you want to achieve.  Go from trendy to classic to flashy with the addition or subtraction of these rhinestones.</li>
            <li> these rhinestones do their job. they make my nails sparkle and i put them on my natural nails with a top coat and they stay on until i take my nail polish off a week later.</li>
            <li> the item is perfect. I choose by price, quality and low shipping cost.  l hope more item like this. It was my first time alone shopping in Amazon, was easy and fast. Pay was a littlw more difficult, but is ok.</li>
            <li> liket it for the summer, enjoy the different colors, and are easy to put on if you have the right tool, otherwise they are hard to manage.  tweezers worked for me.</li>
            <li> I got this to play around on my nails instead of playing the extra $5 at the nail salon for a design.  I&#x27;ve use them a couple of times and love the results.  I was afraid at the purchase that it was being shipped from another country other than the us but it arrived around when expected.</li>
            <li> I thought these were like the one&#x27;s they use at the nail salon, but the jewels are WAY too big for the centers of flowers or anything. They are really too big to be used for nail art. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> This was everything i expected and arrived 10 days before the estimated arrival date, I&#x27;m very please with this product.</li>
            <li> Product was as expected.  I like the variety and the price.I would recommend this product especially for your little princess</li>
            <li> Maybe I don&#x27;t get it right how to put it on but even after watching YouTube videos on how to stick these rhinestones they don&#x27;t stay on for more than 5-10 mins... Don&#x27;t waste your money and time on these...they are useless if doing it on your own nails</li>
            <li> I love the color variety the wheel is very convenient when you are doing different mail designs.I&#x27;d definitely recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> great buy! lots of stones</li>
            <li> Easy placement.  Minimal required to apply.</li>
            <li> They are okay I thought they were gonna be bigger. They are really small but they okay for the price.</li>
            <li> It was horrible. It&#x27;s bad enough it took a while to get to me. It was smaller than it appears to be and it definitely was not 1200 pieces. Total rip off!</li>
            <li> I ordered these for polymer clay charms I make and I also do my own nails. They are great and cheap and it shipped fast!</li>
            <li> The product was shipped fast and was just as described on the site. I&#x27;m very pleased with the product. I like the variety of colors.</li>
            <li> Love these!  Great selection of colors and I would certainly recommend these to anyone who likes to do nail art.</li>
            <li> Product received as advertised. Came pretty quick, fast shipping, packaged well. Some of the companies have been sending me half full things to where the photo doesn&#x27;t match what was being advertised, but this wheel came pretty full and matched the photo that was displayed. Colors are even in the same spot.</li>
            <li> Cannot wait to do my nails.  These are exactly like the ones we get at a nail salon.  Product was shipped quickly and it looks exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li> This item was sent out of state for a Christmas, was told it did arrive on time as stated, won&#x27;t know anything else till opened.</li>
            <li> Just got in the mail today and it doesnt look as filled as it does in the picture. I dont really care though</li>
            <li> Like the others who have reviewed this product, the product came to me in pieces. I ordered two of them (20 pcs) and there were literally hundreds of little sparkly pieces everywhere. The manufacturer needs to come up with a better way of closing the container. Yards of plastic wrap did not help at all. They all had to be individually wrapped for anything to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a shame, because it&#x27;s a very good product, you only get about 1/3 of what you ordered.</li>
            <li> These stones are so delicate and sparkly...I used some right away on a birthday card I made for a young lady</li>
            <li> Nice and small what i was looking for.  I like to add lil accents to myt nails and these were the perfect size for what i wanted nice and small</li>
            <li> Love these rhinestones, plenty of them for the money, they are sparkly and cute! Just what I hoped they would be. Use them on my clients nails and they stay on for a good amount of time with a little glue and a top coat.</li>
            <li> These are so pretty and I love all the colors. The price is amazing and the case they come in is so cute. Shine on:)</li>
            <li> MY DAUGHTER &amp; I USE THESE ALOT... NOT ONLY ON OUR NAILS BUT... CELL PHONES... CLOTHES... SHOES... BOOKS... DECORATIONS... SKIN.. FACE ...HAIR... ALL OVER... THESE ARE AWWWESOME..  THANX &amp; GOD BLESS :D</li>
            <li> These are so nice I love all the colors and sparkles they are easy to put on with the pencil thing.</li>
