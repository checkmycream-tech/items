            <li>Overall very happy with the result.</li>

            <li>This is the best home dye I have tried, and now the only one I will use.</li>
            <li>and I sure as heck give it a top rating.</li>
            <li>I am absolutely in love with the simplicity Vidal Sassoon brought to at home hair color.</li>

            <li>I do wish there was more than 1 pair.</li>
            <li>I feel like there are too many steps</li>
            <li>But the vitality and praise I&#x27;ve received from friends and family after coloring my hair, and how healthy it looks and feels, I don&#x27;t think i&#x27;ll ever go to another brand ever again.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>but I love it.  </li>
            <li>The results were most satisfactory but the process was unwieldy.</li>
            <li>Unlike most hair coloring products, the color stay on longer than most.</li>
            <li>My wife love this product.</li>
            <li>I loved how I colored my hair weeks ago and the color is still bod and colorful.</li>
            <li>Vidal Sassoon is one of my favorite brands for hair products.</li>
            <li>The dye kit even said to make sure you get the hairline well, which is of course attached to skin.</li>
            <li>Very straightforward instructions and</li>
            <li>A great professional look at an affordable price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s important to read the directions thoroughly BEFORE getting started and also to do the recommended patch test to make sure you aren&#x27;t allergic.</li>
            <li>The result is as good as the salon without spending too much.</li>
            <li>This was easy to apply.</li>
            <li>I have some gray., but it was easy to apply.</li>
            <li>As for the actual results, OH MY GOODNESS, the color is beautiful.</li>
            <li>I love that it has everything included in the box and the instructions are super easy to follow.</li>
            <li>hair is fine</li>
            <li>This is a terrific product that&#x27;s easy to use and produces great results.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been fairly happy with the different products over the years of coloring my hair and covering the strands of gray that seem to be appearing more frequently and in greater number!</li>
            <li>I recently recieved this product free from Vidal Sassoon and this is a great product.</li>
            <li>I got this product for free from bzzagent.</li>
            <li>I received this free from BzzAgent to review.  </li>
            <li>I already have a light color in my hair</li>
            <li>I received a free sample of Vidal Sassoon Salonist haircolor from Vidal</li>
            <li>This hair color works well on my light colored brown hair.</li>
            <li>I got to try this free from BzzAgent.</li>
            <li>I will probably try this again, but when I have a helper available.</li>
            <li>I was sent Vidal Sassoon Salonist permanent color to try out for free.</li>
            <li>I mostly concentrated on the part of my hair that I could see, which main meant the top and sides.</li>
            <li>Painting it on \\&quot;salon style\\&quot; was ok and the time it took to set was very reasonable.  </li>
            <li>Best hair colour ever, the color is crazy good, luv it</li>
            <li>There are several steps to take however the directions were easy to follow and it is fairly easy to color on your own.</li>
            <li>The dye kit itself was pretty easy to understand.</li>
            <li>It left my hair looking much more healthy and glossy.</li>
            <li>Overall great products works very well.</li>
            <li>I did notice that the smell of this hair color is very strong, much like at the beauty salons and it did smell up the house with most of the other members of the household complaining about the strong smell.</li>
            <li>It looks like I&#x27;m dying it for the first time!  </li>
            <li>you might if this is your first rodeo!  </li>
            <li>I was very excited to try this new product since it promised a salon quality color.</li>
            <li>Test 1 yielded an excellent result with a complete color transformation (brown to black) as advertised.  </li>
            <li>My hair also feels better, it is no longer dry, it feels so healthy.</li>
            <li>Over the years over the counter hair color became better quality and I am not afraid to see professional once a quarter, while I do touch ups on my hair in between the visits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>color is also deep and it has a nice glow.  </li>
            <li>I received a complimentary sample of this to test out from VIdal Sassoon.</li>
            <li>My hair feels soft, silky, and healthy.</li>
            <li>So now I have two areas where I have obvious not-the-right-color warm brown streaks.</li>
            <li>My most frequently used go-to at-home coloring kits are L&#x27;Oreal branded</li>
            <li>But all in all, I truly suggest this product to use, and its in expensible low price rather than paying way more at a salon and pay yourself the tip of a new you :)</li>
            <li>This product was easy to use and the directions were very clear.</li>
            <li>I absolutely loved the Neutral Black Hair Color.</li>
            <li>When I first received the Vidal Sassoon Salonist Permanent color I was excited to try this new product.</li>
            <li>I was so pleased with the overall process.</li>
            <li>the instructions completely through a couple of times before use, and have some assistance available.</li>
            <li>I have had no skin stains and after the first wash, the dye never faded or washed out.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft, silky and shiny and color is rich.  </li>
            <li>It gave me a salon look and feel and my black is bright and not dull.</li>
            <li>, it is a lot easier that way, not sure I could do this on my own, but I will use it again most definitely.  </li>
            <li>theory is that hair at the roots is new and likely to be more resistant to color.  </li>
            <li>think this is a fine product especially if you have some proficiency with  hair styling and sectioning.</li>
            <li>I am very hapy with this product and will continue to use it at home.</li>
            <li>and it really did not make a difference that I saw.</li>
            <li>This didn&#x27;t burn much at all.</li>
            <li>The color was evenly distributed and was very shiny and looked like I had came from a beauty salon.</li>
            <li>and I am VERY thorough in my applications.</li>
            <li>I really like this product, it has been 3 1/2 weeks since I colored my hair</li>
            <li>This hair coloring system gives professional at home results but takes more time to prepare and color your hair than a regular at home coloring kit.</li>
            <li>I went from a very dark brown with a somewhat warm hue to this black, which is fairly neutral but honestly is too blue (if you use it you will even see the heavy blueness in the process).  </li>
            <li>When I open the box I was excited to see a brush and a mixing bowl is already included in the package, which makes it easier to apply.</li>
            <li>I really love this kit and all it provides, I think other brands can take tips from vidal Sassoon and in providing the accessories to color hair with a bowl and brush</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does a good job disguising grey hair, but I would recommend choosing a color similar to the natural hair color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love all it does and has to offer, full coverage, plenty of conditioner to make the color last longer than any other brand who gives you a one time use.  </li>
            <li>It is a nice enough product, and the color is bright and hasn&#x27;t started fading, but I don&#x27;t think I would purchase unless it was considerably less than the color I usually buy.</li>
            <li>My hair was glossy and the color was vibrant and multi-dimensional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I was concerned about adequate coverage in the back.</li>
            <li>My hair is now all one color, a very rich evenly covered black.</li>
            <li>I highly reccomend trying out this product.</li>
            <li>Loaned the neutral black kit to a stylist friend of mine that loves to experiment with hair color on an almost weekly basis to watch her test out this one and, so far, I&#x27;m pleased with the results on non-dyed hair but not so much with those changing already dyed hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair is very shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit messy so be sure to cover your bathroom with newspaper.</li>
            <li>The color normally lasts around three weeks</li>
            <li>Another perk is there is no awful chemical smell while dying your hair, I only noticed a very faint but pleasant smell.  </li>
            <li>I will try one of the other colors that are available.</li>
            <li>also feel it&#x27;s worth noting how flat the color is.</li>
            <li>This will be my new hair color.  </li>
            <li>It helps to have an assistant and I must say I did gain a new appreciation for my stylist.</li>
            <li>Just because you&#x27;ve safely used these types of products in the past does not mean that you can&#x27;t have a reaction this time.</li>
            <li>The kit was also very easy to apply in a few simple steps and 20 minutes later to the point where even I, an aging male that has never colored his own hair beyond the increasing grey hair, could figure it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This 2 step proccess took loonger than the other home dyes I&#x27;ve used, but the results were well worth it!</li>
            <li>Once you start putting it on, you need to do the roots first , then the second step is to mix up the serum with the remaining color and apply to the rest of your hair.</li>
            <li>but I found it the exact opposite.</li>
            <li>, we attempted two tests (acquired an additional kit for test 2); the first was the control with a lady that had NOT dyed her hair while the second test was someone going from one dye to another.  </li>
            <li>I usually pull mine up on top my head.&lt;br /&gt;Step</li>
            <li>Most dye comes with a bottle &amp; a liquid dye, which tends to be very messy.</li>
            <li>The color of my hair came out so black and my hair is so smooth and shiny</li>
            <li>Even professional stylists woudl apply color on th eroots first and then apply the rest of the colotr fo rthe last 15 minutes on the rest of the haitr&#x27;s length.  </li>
            <li>Afterwards --The color was rather flat at first</li>
            <li>With many black hair colors you run the risk of looking like Snow White.</li>
            <li>The color is so rich and the results are long lasting.</li>
            <li>but I assume that one should wait a certain period of time BEFORE changing dyes, not to mention everyone&#x27;s hair reacts differently.  </li>
            <li>I got a rich black color, and it made my hair so soft.  </li>
            <li>Now the same process can be accomplished by \\&quot;do</li>
            <li>My old color had started to fade a bit.</li>
            <li>I read the reviews, but still was not prepared for how much my color runs when I wash it, even after several washes.  </li>
            <li>I have 4B/4C natural hair and it did nothing for my hair.</li>
            <li>So far, it has been one month since coloring and the color is still holding up.</li>
            <li>The brush really helps my get all of my grays and the roots overall.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft, I do like</li>
            <li>I would consider buying it again, but need to wait to see how long the color lasts.at first</li>
            <li>cautious when using this on previously-dyed hair; let it grow out and starting fresh, if possible.  </li>
            <li>The application takes longer than other brands but its well worth it.</li>
            <li>No, it might not be the oriental black that I normally have used, but it is lovely none the less.</li>
            <li>Typical of most dyes, it stains skin and counter tops and sinks.</li>
            <li>I used the most natural stuff last time and didn&#x27;t get the dark black I wanted, and even that burned my scalp.</li>
            <li>When I have my hair professionally dyed, they paint on the dye, using a similar brush, which enables the hair dresser to put the dye on the roots firat &amp; then the rest of the hair, so that the roots are fully coverd.</li>
            <li>My last hair color was done professionally.</li>
            <li>I rather have a dye that is one treatment that only last three weeks, then clean up all the mess that came with this treatment that lasted a month.</li>
            <li>If I had to do this every time I colored my hair, I am sure it would only be a matter of time before I dumped half of it down the sink.  </li>
            <li>First and foremost, I want to mention I received the Vidal Sassoon Salonist Hair Colour Permanent Kit in Neutral Black from bzzagent and vidal Sassoon for review purposes.  </li>
            <li>This was new to me as the other brand I&#x27;ve used doesn&#x27;t require this.</li>
            <li>The 2 step process is a little time consuming and an extra pair of gloves would have been appreciated.</li>
            <li>No one wants flat, inky black hair.</li>

            <li> This is a terrific product that&#x27;s easy to use and produces great results.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been fairly happy with the different products over the years of coloring my hair and covering the strands of gray that seem to be appearing more frequently and in greater number!</li>
            <li> I recently recieved this product free from Vidal Sassoon and this is a great product.</li>
            <li> I got this product for free from bzzagent.</li>
            <li> I received this free from BzzAgent to review.  </li>
            <li> I already have a light color in my hair</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of Vidal Sassoon Salonist haircolor from Vidal</li>
            <li> This hair color works well on my light colored brown hair.</li>
            <li> I got to try this free from BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> I will probably try this again, but when I have a helper available.</li>
            <li> I was sent Vidal Sassoon Salonist permanent color to try out for free.</li>
            <li> I mostly concentrated on the part of my hair that I could see, which main meant the top and sides.</li>
            <li> Painting it on \\&quot;salon style\\&quot; was ok and the time it took to set was very reasonable.  </li>
            <li> Best hair colour ever, the color is crazy good, luv it</li>
            <li> There are several steps to take however the directions were easy to follow and it is fairly easy to color on your own.</li>
            <li> The dye kit itself was pretty easy to understand.</li>
            <li> It left my hair looking much more healthy and glossy.</li>
            <li> Overall great products works very well.</li>
            <li> I did notice that the smell of this hair color is very strong, much like at the beauty salons and it did smell up the house with most of the other members of the household complaining about the strong smell.</li>
            <li> It looks like I&#x27;m dying it for the first time!  </li>
            <li> you might if this is your first rodeo!  </li>
            <li> I was very excited to try this new product since it promised a salon quality color.</li>
            <li> Test 1 yielded an excellent result with a complete color transformation (brown to black) as advertised.  </li>
            <li> My hair also feels better, it is no longer dry, it feels so healthy.</li>
            <li> Over the years over the counter hair color became better quality and I am not afraid to see professional once a quarter, while I do touch ups on my hair in between the visits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> color is also deep and it has a nice glow.  </li>
            <li> I received a complimentary sample of this to test out from VIdal Sassoon.</li>
            <li> My hair feels soft, silky, and healthy.</li>
            <li> So now I have two areas where I have obvious not-the-right-color warm brown streaks.</li>
            <li> My most frequently used go-to at-home coloring kits are L&#x27;Oreal branded</li>
            <li> But all in all, I truly suggest this product to use, and its in expensible low price rather than paying way more at a salon and pay yourself the tip of a new you :)</li>
            <li> This product was easy to use and the directions were very clear.</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved the Neutral Black Hair Color.</li>
            <li> When I first received the Vidal Sassoon Salonist Permanent color I was excited to try this new product.</li>
            <li> I was so pleased with the overall process.</li>
            <li> the instructions completely through a couple of times before use, and have some assistance available.</li>
            <li> I have had no skin stains and after the first wash, the dye never faded or washed out.</li>
            <li> My hair is soft, silky and shiny and color is rich.  </li>
            <li> It gave me a salon look and feel and my black is bright and not dull.</li>
            <li> , it is a lot easier that way, not sure I could do this on my own, but I will use it again most definitely.  </li>
            <li> theory is that hair at the roots is new and likely to be more resistant to color.  </li>
            <li> think this is a fine product especially if you have some proficiency with  hair styling and sectioning.</li>
            <li> I am very hapy with this product and will continue to use it at home.</li>
            <li> and it really did not make a difference that I saw.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t burn much at all.</li>
            <li> The color was evenly distributed and was very shiny and looked like I had came from a beauty salon.</li>
            <li> and I am VERY thorough in my applications.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, it has been 3 1/2 weeks since I colored my hair</li>
            <li> This hair coloring system gives professional at home results but takes more time to prepare and color your hair than a regular at home coloring kit.</li>
            <li> I went from a very dark brown with a somewhat warm hue to this black, which is fairly neutral but honestly is too blue (if you use it you will even see the heavy blueness in the process).  </li>
            <li> When I open the box I was excited to see a brush and a mixing bowl is already included in the package, which makes it easier to apply.</li>
            <li> I really love this kit and all it provides, I think other brands can take tips from vidal Sassoon and in providing the accessories to color hair with a bowl and brush</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does a good job disguising grey hair, but I would recommend choosing a color similar to the natural hair color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love all it does and has to offer, full coverage, plenty of conditioner to make the color last longer than any other brand who gives you a one time use.  </li>
            <li> It is a nice enough product, and the color is bright and hasn&#x27;t started fading, but I don&#x27;t think I would purchase unless it was considerably less than the color I usually buy.</li>
            <li> My hair was glossy and the color was vibrant and multi-dimensional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I was concerned about adequate coverage in the back.</li>
            <li> My hair is now all one color, a very rich evenly covered black.</li>
            <li> I highly reccomend trying out this product.</li>
            <li> Loaned the neutral black kit to a stylist friend of mine that loves to experiment with hair color on an almost weekly basis to watch her test out this one and, so far, I&#x27;m pleased with the results on non-dyed hair but not so much with those changing already dyed hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair is very shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit messy so be sure to cover your bathroom with newspaper.</li>
            <li> The color normally lasts around three weeks</li>
            <li> Another perk is there is no awful chemical smell while dying your hair, I only noticed a very faint but pleasant smell.  </li>
            <li> I will try one of the other colors that are available.</li>
            <li> also feel it&#x27;s worth noting how flat the color is.</li>
            <li> This will be my new hair color.  </li>
            <li> It helps to have an assistant and I must say I did gain a new appreciation for my stylist.</li>
            <li> Just because you&#x27;ve safely used these types of products in the past does not mean that you can&#x27;t have a reaction this time.</li>
            <li> The kit was also very easy to apply in a few simple steps and 20 minutes later to the point where even I, an aging male that has never colored his own hair beyond the increasing grey hair, could figure it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This 2 step proccess took loonger than the other home dyes I&#x27;ve used, but the results were well worth it!</li>
            <li> Once you start putting it on, you need to do the roots first , then the second step is to mix up the serum with the remaining color and apply to the rest of your hair.</li>
            <li> but I found it the exact opposite.</li>
            <li> , we attempted two tests (acquired an additional kit for test 2); the first was the control with a lady that had NOT dyed her hair while the second test was someone going from one dye to another.  </li>
            <li> I usually pull mine up on top my head.&lt;br /&gt;Step</li>
            <li> Most dye comes with a bottle &amp; a liquid dye, which tends to be very messy.</li>
            <li> The color of my hair came out so black and my hair is so smooth and shiny</li>
            <li> Even professional stylists woudl apply color on th eroots first and then apply the rest of the colotr fo rthe last 15 minutes on the rest of the haitr&#x27;s length.  </li>
            <li> Afterwards --The color was rather flat at first</li>
            <li> With many black hair colors you run the risk of looking like Snow White.</li>
            <li> The color is so rich and the results are long lasting.</li>
            <li> but I assume that one should wait a certain period of time BEFORE changing dyes, not to mention everyone&#x27;s hair reacts differently.  </li>
            <li> I got a rich black color, and it made my hair so soft.  </li>
            <li> Now the same process can be accomplished by \\&quot;do</li>
            <li> My old color had started to fade a bit.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews, but still was not prepared for how much my color runs when I wash it, even after several washes.  </li>
            <li> I have 4B/4C natural hair and it did nothing for my hair.</li>
            <li> So far, it has been one month since coloring and the color is still holding up.</li>
            <li> The brush really helps my get all of my grays and the roots overall.</li>
            <li> My hair is soft, I do like</li>
            <li> I would consider buying it again, but need to wait to see how long the color lasts.at first</li>
            <li> cautious when using this on previously-dyed hair; let it grow out and starting fresh, if possible.  </li>
            <li> The application takes longer than other brands but its well worth it.</li>
            <li> No, it might not be the oriental black that I normally have used, but it is lovely none the less.</li>
            <li> Typical of most dyes, it stains skin and counter tops and sinks.</li>
            <li> I used the most natural stuff last time and didn&#x27;t get the dark black I wanted, and even that burned my scalp.</li>
            <li> When I have my hair professionally dyed, they paint on the dye, using a similar brush, which enables the hair dresser to put the dye on the roots firat &amp; then the rest of the hair, so that the roots are fully coverd.</li>
            <li> My last hair color was done professionally.</li>
            <li> I rather have a dye that is one treatment that only last three weeks, then clean up all the mess that came with this treatment that lasted a month.</li>
            <li> If I had to do this every time I colored my hair, I am sure it would only be a matter of time before I dumped half of it down the sink.  </li>
            <li> First and foremost, I want to mention I received the Vidal Sassoon Salonist Hair Colour Permanent Kit in Neutral Black from bzzagent and vidal Sassoon for review purposes.  </li>
            <li> This was new to me as the other brand I&#x27;ve used doesn&#x27;t require this.</li>
            <li> The 2 step process is a little time consuming and an extra pair of gloves would have been appreciated.</li>
            <li> No one wants flat, inky black hair.</li>
            <li> I liked this because it took less time overall than my usual brand, but it was a little different of application process than I&#x27;m used to.</li>
            <li> I liked this because it took less time overall than my usual brand, but it was a little different of application process than I&#x27;m used to.</li>
            <li> This color lasted a few weeks longer than my normal at home coloring</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous to try this new type by Vidal Sassoon as it involves using a bowl and brush as opposed to a comb style applicator.</li>
            <li> This was not a good first impression.  </li>
            <li> It lasted a long time.  </li>
            <li> and it does take a long time.</li>
            <li> It covered my grey and those are still grey.</li>
            <li> I would consider buying it again, but need to wait to see how long the color lasts.</li>
            <li> If you have a sandy blonde or even lighter blonde look.. I would leave this in longer if you&#x27;re going for jet black.</li>
            <li> I knew the entire process was going to be differnt than the other home dye kits I had tried.</li>
            <li> There are several colors to choose from and I cant wait to try the other colors.</li>
            <li> at home kits leaves my hair dry but not Vidal Sassoon Salonist.</li>
            <li> My hair wasn&#x27;t dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> allow to dry or style as usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so it was a bit dry when I started this treatment.</li>
            <li> A few gray hairs at the roots are starting to sprout up but the overall color has not faded.</li>
            <li> I used a previous dye and I left it in for the recommended time, so decided to go longer for this.</li>
            <li> mixed results with a change to dark but not nearly as much.  </li>
            <li> I have dyed my hair black with a different type of box kit for the majority of my life.</li>
            <li> Not only that, my tub and hands were also stained black.</li>
            <li> I would buy this product again but would purchase some extra gloves and would do it after my little one was in bed.</li>
            <li> and so I chose a shade very similar to my usual shade and had grown my roots out quite a bit.  </li>
            <li> I am looking forward to trying this in other colors.</li>
            <li> Now, this is a bit hard to do in the back of your head by yourself.</li>
            <li> My mom however needed help because the instruction is a bit confusing for her, maybe next time it won&#x27;t be.&lt;br /&gt;Some</li>
            <li> color my hair every 6 weeks and don&#x27;t spend a lot of money on home hair color because my hair is black.</li>
            <li> The result is shiny, black hair.</li>
            <li> and so I needed 3 and a half bottles</li>
            <li> Just a slight smell I could do without</li>
            <li> However, to avoid the mess, you will want to protect them.</li>
            <li> 3 - WAIT -- it says 10 minutes, but I waited a little longer (maybe an additional 2 minutes).&lt;br /&gt;Step</li>
            <li> In a few few weeks I will need to recolor.</li>
            <li> It can be messy.</li>
            <li> I did like the heavy duty gloves</li>
            <li> but it was messy</li>
            <li> While coloring my hair, the dye touched my forehead and my ears for no more that five seconds before my skin was stained black.</li>
            <li> Leaves your hair really dark!!</li>
            <li> I did not like having to mix the contents in a small bowl with a brush.  </li>
            <li> I have been dying my hair for years, usually at home.</li>
            <li> I prefer the quality of having it done at a Salon, but it&#x27;s just too expensive to do on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> Got the Vidal Sassoon Salonist permanent hair color in black to sample and review !!</li>
            <li> Everything I needed was in one place and the hard to mistake illustrated instructions</li>
            <li> I have thick hair</li>
            <li> Overall really disappointed.</li>
            <li> This has step by step directions,so you cannot go wrong.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love that Vidal Sassoon came up with this product.  I color my hair every 5 weeks, so have to do a root touch up.  Not only is that service expensive, but I also end up paying more for deep conditioning and styling, not to mention trim.  Even professional stylists woudl apply color on th eroots first and then apply the rest of the colotr fo rthe last 15 minutes on the rest of the haitr&#x27;s length.  Now the same process can be accomplished by \\&quot;do it yourself\\&quot; method.  Over the years over the counter hair color became better quality and I am not afraid to see professional once a quarter, while I do touch ups on my hair in between the visits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This color is also deep and it has a nice glow.  After treatment I put hair mask (Sebastian) and kept it overnight in my hair.  My hair is soft, silky and shiny and color is rich.  I am very hapy with this product and will continue to use it at home.</li>
            <li> I got this product for free from bzzagent. When I open the box I was excited to see a brush and a mixing bowl is already included in the package, which makes it easier to apply. My mom however needed help because the instruction is a bit confusing for her, maybe next time it won&#x27;t be.&lt;br /&gt;Some at home kits leaves my hair dry but not Vidal Sassoon Salonist. The result is as good as the salon without spending too much. Overall very happy with the result.</li>
            <li> I received this free from BzzAgent to review.  I regularly color my hair and so I chose a shade very similar to my usual shade and had grown my roots out quite a bit.  My old color had started to fade a bit. I did not like having to mix the contents in a small bowl with a brush.  If I had to do this every time I colored my hair, I am sure it would only be a matter of time before I dumped half of it down the sink.  Painting it on \\&quot;salon style\\&quot; was ok and the time it took to set was very reasonable.  It smelled nice too.  I read the reviews, but still was not prepared for how much my color runs when I wash it, even after several washes.  It looks like I&#x27;m dying it for the first time!  It is a nice enough product, and the color is bright and hasn&#x27;t started fading, but I don&#x27;t think I would purchase unless it was considerably less than the color I usually buy.</li>
            <li> When I first received the Vidal Sassoon Salonist Permanent color I was excited to try this new product. I have been dying my hair for years, usually at home. I prefer the quality of having it done at a Salon, but it&#x27;s just too expensive to do on a regular basis. So, most often I settle for dying it home. The Vidal Sassoon box comes with a mixing tray &amp; dye brish inside, as soon as I saw this I knew the entire process was going to be differnt than the other home dye kits I had tried. Most dye comes with a bottle &amp; a liquid dye, which tends to be very messy. When I have my hair professionally dyed, they paint on the dye, using a similar brush, which enables the hair dresser to put the dye on the roots firat &amp; then the rest of the hair, so that the roots are fully coverd. Ive always felt this was the biggest flaw with dying my hair at home. This dye solves that problem. This 2 step proccess took loonger than the other home dyes I&#x27;ve used, but the results were well worth it! The dye covered all my hair evenly, no visible roots, or different shades. My hair is now all one color, a very rich evenly covered black. My hair also feels better, it is no longer dry, it feels so healthy. It left my hair looking much more healthy and glossy. What a great qualtiy product. This is the best home dye I have tried, and now the only one I will use. I highly reccomend trying out this product. You will see the difference immediatly.</li>
            <li> I have 4B/4C natural hair and it did nothing for my hair.This was not a good first impression.  I already have a light color in my hair and it really did not make a difference that I saw. I received this from the company, but I will give this product another shot after about 3 months , so that I wont damage my hair.  I received this product in exchange for my honest review. #bzzagent#gotitfree@bzzagent</li>
            <li> This will be my new hair color.  This product is like going to a hair salon.  It had all the components my hair dresser uses to color my hair.  The coverage was great, the color great.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> What can I say?  This is a terrific product that&#x27;s easy to use and produces great results.  This is the best hair coloring product you&#x27;ll find out there and I sure as heck give it a top rating.</li>
            <li> Vidal Sassoon has given me to try FREE this product, in this awesome shade and has made me a PROfessional!  and in my jammies no less!&lt;br /&gt;  By far the BEST product to date on the shelves.  Everything I needed was in one place and the hard to mistake illustrated instructions didn&#x27;t even need to be read, tho you might if this is your first rodeo!  the Color is amazing, dual to tri-colored highlights shimmer on my roots and the shine and condition (included) is wonderful.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of Vidal Sassoon Salonist haircolor from Vidal Sassoon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has been quite awhile since I have colored my hair. My last hair color was done professionally. I am absolutely in love with the simplicity Vidal Sassoon brought to at home hair color. The instructions are &amp;#34;dummy proof.&amp;#34; The instructions have pictures and the steps are very easy to follow. Vidal Sassoon provided everything that was needed (bowl, brush, and gloves). I will try one of the other colors that are available. Since this was doing this at home, I wanted to make sure I got a color that wasnt noticeable if I messed up. There are several colors to choose from and I cant wait to try the other colors.</li>
            <li> This hair color works well on my light colored brown hair.This was easy to apply. Everything&#x27;s in the kit you need. This has step by step directions,so you cannot go wrong. I have to say the easiest hair dye to apply. I have some gray., but it was easy to apply. This covers your gray fully. I have a lot of gray in front. I was pleased that the gray  turned out to be highlights. Overall great products works very well.</li>
            <li> Achieved the results I want, left in for about 55 minutes. I used a previous dye and I left it in for the recommended time, so decided to go longer for this. If you have a sandy blonde or even lighter blonde look.. I would leave this in longer if you&#x27;re going for jet black. I used the most natural stuff last time and didn&#x27;t get the dark black I wanted, and even that burned my scalp. This didn&#x27;t burn much at all. It&#x27;s a bit messy so be sure to cover your bathroom with newspaper.</li>
            <li> I received a complimentary sample of this to test out from VIdal Sassoon. This hair coloring system gives professional at home results but takes more time to prepare and color your hair than a regular at home coloring kit. It takes about 5 minutes to prep the color before you even put it on your hair. Once you start putting it on, you need to do the roots first , then the second step is to mix up the serum with the remaining color and apply to the rest of your hair. I did notice that the smell of this hair color is very strong, much like at the beauty salons and it did smell up the house with most of the other members of the household complaining about the strong smell. The conditioner that was supplied had wonderful results with my frizzy hair and really smoothed it out. The color results were amazing. The color was evenly distributed and was very shiny and looked like I had came from a beauty salon. So far, it has been one month since coloring and the color is still holding up. A few gray hairs at the roots are starting to sprout up but the overall color has not faded. In a few few weeks I will need to recolor. This color lasted a few weeks longer than my normal at home coloring so if you have extra time to pamper yourself then this coloring kit is for you.</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved the Neutral Black Hair Color. My hair wasn&#x27;t dry and brittle. I got a rich black color, and it made my hair so soft.  It lasted a long time.  I got it from Vidal Sassoon , and I&#x27;m glad I tried the product.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try this new product since it promised a salon quality color. It TOTALLY kept it&#x27;s promise. I love that it has everything included in the box and the instructions are super easy to follow. The mixing tray is perfect size and the gloves included are fantastic. I do wish there was more than 1 pair. While the instructions are simple to follow I feel like there are too many steps and it does take a long time. I have a toddler so I don&#x27;t always have the luxury of extra time during the day. The 2 step process is a little time consuming and an extra pair of gloves would have been appreciated. At one point you have to wait and then apply color with gloves that are already covered in dye. It can be messy. As for the actual results, OH MY GOODNESS, the color is beautiful. My hair feels soft, silky, and healthy. The color is so rich and the results are long lasting. I am on week 3 and there is no fading. It covered my grey and those are still grey. I would buy this product again but would purchase some extra gloves and would do it after my little one was in bed. I received this product for review from Vidal Sassoon but opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> First and foremost, I want to mention I received the Vidal Sassoon Salonist Hair Colour Permanent Kit in Neutral Black from bzzagent and vidal Sassoon for review purposes.  I really love this kit and all it provides, I think other brands can take tips from vidal Sassoon and in providing the accessories to color hair with a bowl and brush, lol.  But the vitality and praise I&#x27;ve received from friends and family after coloring my hair, and how healthy it looks and feels, I don&#x27;t think i&#x27;ll ever go to another brand ever again.  I love all it does and has to offer, full coverage, plenty of conditioner to make the color last longer than any other brand who gives you a one time use.  But all in all, I truly suggest this product to use, and its in expensible low price rather than paying way more at a salon and pay yourself the tip of a new you :)</li>
            <li> I received this product through BzzAgent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I color my hair every 6 weeks and don&#x27;t spend a lot of money on home hair color because my hair is black. The best thing I like about this system is that I can shampoo my hair so I don&#x27;t have to worry about dye on my hairline. Because I didn&#x27;t have that fear, all of my baby hairs were dyed. The result is shiny, black hair.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use! I was so pleased with the overall process. It seems like it would be more complicated but I found it the exact opposite. The brush really helps my get all of my grays and the roots overall. The problem I have encountered 4 times now using Vidal Sasson hair color is that for some reason I always have areas that will not take the color and I am VERY thorough in my applications. I went from a very dark brown with a somewhat warm hue to this black, which is fairly neutral but honestly is too blue (if you use it you will even see the heavy blueness in the process).  So now I have two areas where I have obvious not-the-right-color warm brown streaks. *sigh* Having had this occur with this brand 4 times now I am just done with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also feel it&#x27;s worth noting how flat the color is. My hair is soft, I do like the overall feel my hair is left with when I use this brand, but there&#x27;s no depth to this color at all. No shine. Overall really disappointed.</li>
            <li> Loaned the neutral black kit to a stylist friend of mine that loves to experiment with hair color on an almost weekly basis to watch her test out this one and, so far, I&#x27;m pleased with the results on non-dyed hair but not so much with those changing already dyed hair.  The kit was also very easy to apply in a few simple steps and 20 minutes later to the point where even I, an aging male that has never colored his own hair beyond the increasing grey hair, could figure it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, we attempted two tests (acquired an additional kit for test 2); the first was the control with a lady that had NOT dyed her hair while the second test was someone going from one dye to another.  Test 1 yielded an excellent result with a complete color transformation (brown to black) as advertised.  The 2nd test heralded... mixed results with a change to dark but not nearly as much.  Now, I&#x27;m no stylist but I assume that one should wait a certain period of time BEFORE changing dyes, not to mention everyone&#x27;s hair reacts differently.  More tests are needed, but I think the Vidal color works great on non-dyed hair for desired results.</li>
            <li> This product exceeded my expectations, I got it from Vidal Sassoon and I love it.  I have thick hair and so I needed 3 and a half bottles but I love it.  Will buy again.  It covers as says root to tip!</li>
            <li> I really like this product, it has been 3 1/2 weeks since I colored my hair and it still looks great and feels amazing.  The color of my hair came out so black and my hair is so smooth and shiny, I cannot recall ever being this happy with a color.  Another perk is there is no awful chemical smell while dying your hair, I only noticed a very faint but pleasant smell.  I did have someone dye my hair, it is a lot easier that way, not sure I could do this on my own, but I will use it again most definitely.  Closest thing I ever came close to for salon style at home.  I got to try this free from BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> I recently recieved this product free from Vidal Sassoon and this is a great product. It gave me a salon look and feel and my black is bright and not dull. A great professional look at an affordable price.</li>
            <li> Best hair colour ever, the color is crazy good, luv it</li>
            <li> With many black hair colors you run the risk of looking like Snow White. No one wants flat, inky black hair. But while I was impressed with the results, it is time consuming and sloppy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The theory is that hair at the roots is new and likely to be more resistant to color.  The roots are colored before the remaining hair. A dish, brush and gloves are provided along with  a tube of color, a bottle of activator, a sachet of serum and a tube of color preserving conditioner. The trick is to section and divide the hair and apply evenly. It helps to have an assistant and I must say I did gain a new appreciation for my stylist. But the end result was impressive. My hair was glossy and the color was vibrant and multi-dimensional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this is a fine product especially if you have some proficiency with  hair styling and sectioning. The results were most satisfactory but the process was unwieldy. I did like the heavy duty gloves but it was messy and I was concerned about adequate coverage in the back. I will probably try this again, but when I have a helper available.</li>
            <li> This product was easy to use and the directions were very clear. My hair color came out great. Unlike most hair coloring products, the color stay on longer than most. The product lasted for about three weeks which I think is quite good. Typical of most dyes, it stains skin and counter tops and sinks. I found that Acetone removes the stains from these surfaces. However, to avoid the mess, you will want to protect them. Soap and water removes the stains from your skin easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All and all this was a good product.</li>
            <li> Leaves your hair really dark!! Great product. Just a slight smell I could do without</li>
            <li> The Vidal Sassoon Salonist Hair Colour Permanent kit has everything needed for a two-step process that results in natural-looking color at both the roots and in the established hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does a good job disguising grey hair, but I would recommend choosing a color similar to the natural hair color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be cautious when using this on previously-dyed hair; let it grow out and starting fresh, if possible.  However, the two-step process can accommodate colored hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read the instructions completely through a couple of times before use, and have some assistance available.</li>
            <li> My wife love this product. Best colour product  that we have seen in the market. The application takes longer than other brands but its well worth it.</li>
            <li> Got the Vidal Sassoon Salonist permanent hair color in black to sample and review !! There are several steps to take however the directions were easy to follow and it is fairly easy to color on your own. I loved how I colored my hair weeks ago and the color is still bod and colorful. I am looking forward to trying this in other colors. Vidal Sassoon is one of my favorite brands for hair products.</li>
            <li> I was sent Vidal Sassoon Salonist permanent color to try out for free. I have dyed my hair black with a different type of box kit for the majority of my life. The color normally lasts around three weeks and then I have to touch up my roots. I have had no skin stains and after the first wash, the dye never faded or washed out. With all of that being known, Vidal Sassoon Salonist permanent color is NOT like that. While coloring my hair, the dye touched my forehead and my ears for no more that five seconds before my skin was stained black. Not only that, my tub and hands were also stained black. It took two days before the dye finally faded from my skin. I tried dish soap mixed with baking soda, fingernail polish remover, alcohol, peroxide, and even bleach to get the dye off of my skin. None of it worked. The dye kit even said to make sure you get the hairline well, which is of course attached to skin. The dye kit itself was pretty easy to understand. I think there should have been two sets of gloves in the kit though. You have to wait 20 minutes in between treatments which means I had to sit there for 20 minutes with gloves on that had dye on them. The dye itself is beautiful. My hair is very shiny and soft. No, it might not be the oriental black that I normally have used, but it is lovely none the less. All in all, I would not use this product again. It was too messy and very time consuming. I rather have a dye that is one treatment that only last three weeks, then clean up all the mess that came with this treatment that lasted a month.</li>
            <li> Very straightforward instructions and the result was impressive. I will be using this product henceforth, and will be coloring my hair at home myself. I achieved an excellent result compared with what I paid for at the salon. VS Salonist rocks!!! Thank you guys.</li>
            <li> My most frequently used go-to at-home coloring kits are L&#x27;Oreal branded and I&#x27;ve been fairly happy with the different products over the years of coloring my hair and covering the strands of gray that seem to be appearing more frequently and in greater number! I was a little nervous to try this new type by Vidal Sassoon as it involves using a bowl and brush as opposed to a comb style applicator. It&#x27;s important to read the directions thoroughly BEFORE getting started and also to do the recommended patch test to make sure you aren&#x27;t allergic. Just because you&#x27;ve safely used these types of products in the past does not mean that you can&#x27;t have a reaction this time. Use the gloves and wipe up any stains promptly especially from painted surfaces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 1 -- PREP -- you will use the brush and dip it in the bowl of cream to apply about 3/4 of the colorant to your roots all around your head. Now, this is a bit hard to do in the back of your head by yourself. I mostly concentrated on the part of my hair that I could see, which main meant the top and sides. It seemed to be OK.&lt;br /&gt;Step 2 -- BLEND -- you add the serum to the bowl and mix it up. Then, using your gloved hand(s), saturate all of the rest of your hair and massage into the roots as well. I usually pull mine up on top my head.&lt;br /&gt;Step 3 - WAIT -- it says 10 minutes, but I waited a little longer (maybe an additional 2 minutes).&lt;br /&gt;Step 4 - RINSE -- rinse thoroughly and then apply your regular shampoo. This was new to me as the other brand I&#x27;ve used doesn&#x27;t require this. Rinse the shampoo out of your hair.&lt;br /&gt;Step 5 - CONDITION -- apply the included salonist color preserving cream to your hair and leave on for 2 minutes (again I leave it on longer).&lt;br /&gt;Step 6 - RINSE the conditioner thoroughly from your hair.&lt;br /&gt;Then allow to dry or style as usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is fine and I&#x27;ve been coloring it for years so it was a bit dry when I started this treatment. Afterwards --The color was rather flat at first but after a couple of washings it seems that it starts to show some highlights (or maybe that is some of the color fading). I don&#x27;t have a lot of gray hair so the coverage seemed good.  I liked this because it took less time overall than my usual brand, but it was a little different of application process than I&#x27;m used to. I would consider buying it again, but need to wait to see how long the color lasts.at first but after a couple of washings it seems that it starts to show some highlights (or maybe that is some of the color fading).
