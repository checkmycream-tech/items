            <li>This is a great soap and it works well on acne.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t experienced any over drying of my skin either.</li>
            <li>This soap is great</li>
            <li>If all I have to do is use this soap and sea breeze I will be happy.</li>
            <li>lol.</li>
            <li>But I experienced contact dermatitis from this soap.</li>
            <li>, i also think that for me its great because now that i have turned 20</li>
            <li>This soap works great, it was recommended by my dermatologist.  </li>
            <li>great for removing excess body acne.</li>
            <li>This bar soap worked great for me.  </li>
            <li>Great Product.</li>
            <li>Has a great price here on amazon.</li>
            <li>This stuff works great.</li>
            <li>This is clearing up my skin very nicely.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m seeing amazing differences!</li>
            <li>AMAZING!  </li>
            <li>I would also make sure to use the bar as that has seemed to have the best results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m wondering if anyone knows of any good alternatives?</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it works that good.  </li>
            <li>Even using a good lotion after application made no difference.</li>
            <li>It is a bit drying, but just get some good lotion</li>
            <li>So its good stuff.</li>
            <li>This was good.</li>
            <li>I have fair skin</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t bleach my sheets or clothes and follow up with a good moisturizer, depending on the weather.</li>
            <li>, I am good to go.</li>
            <li>good luck</li>
            <li>good shipping.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m still trying to find a good moisturizer to help with that.</li>
            <li>So if anyone can recommend a good one for oily skin that would help.</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m happy and my skin is much better now.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So I am very glad I found it on amazon.  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I was even able to change from a coverup foundation to just a tinted moisturizer with vitamins in it!</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>What is so great about the bar is that it is really EASY to use it every day.  </li>
            <li>I think this product is amazing.</li>
            <li>I am so happy this is available again.</li>
            <li>My skin looks absolutely amazing, I just had to write a review.</li>
            <li>The kind of zits that are stubborn too, they returned over and over again.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, most of us just need a good soap for the morning, after work, and bedtime.  </li>
            <li>The medication in the soap is great at clearing up blemishes, and better yet, prevents break-outs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tend to have oily skin on my face, but using PanOxl soap in the morning and at night prevents my face from becoming shiney.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend to anyone unless they have very, very strong skin.</li>
            <li>I am so glad because I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>However, it is the best thing that I have found thus far.</li>
            <li>So far I am over whelmed with relief and joy, I wont be embarrassed to wear sleeveless shirts this summer!!  </li>
            <li>This is by far the best product I have found to control my acne.</li>
            <li>Not the most effective bar.</li>
            <li>I am sure this bar will work miracles for most, but those of you who have some more sensitive skin like mine, try the Face Wash instead, it works wonderfully.</li>
            <li>itself.&lt;br /&gt;Benzoyl Peroxide is a near-miracle medicine, as it works for most acne sufferers without prescriptions.  </li>
            <li>I have only been using it at night and have been very impressed.  </li>
            <li>My athletic teenager&#x27;s back-ne has responded better to this than liquid Benzoyl Peroxide washes, gels, ointments.</li>
            <li>This product is perhaps the greatest I ever used on my chest and back.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for years and absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t recommend leaving in on for any more than a minute before washing it off.</li>
            <li>After reading all the reports that this product was discontinued I decided to go to the source and find out for sure.  </li>
            <li>He also specifically told me NOT to use it on my face, as you could gather from many of these reviews.</li>
            <li>Love this for using once a week on my body.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it on my face but it does an awesome job and keeping away pimples on my back or chest.</li>
            <li>gave my skin a rash, this is supposed to cure acne or to give you more acne?</li>
            <li>This is the best working product, I use it to wash shoulders, neck, back, face twice a day</li>
            <li>I am so pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li>Glad to see that it is carried on amazon.</li>
            <li>Nothing I have tried has worked like this, the closest thing I was doing was literally using my biore face wash (which I LOVE fyi for my face) on my underarms, but I was still getting these bumps.</li>
            <li>and I find it works so much better than Proactive.</li>
            <li>I ordered this to try it on my acne, it was ok, made my skin peel from dryness but still remained oily and had pimples...</li>
            <li>I always buy multiples of this bar to make sure I have some to use as a couple days without this you will notice some flare ups appearing.</li>
            <li>I wish more stores carried this product.  </li>
            <li>I bought this at wal-mart while i was out after reading many reviews on it</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love this bar.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been able to find this at CVS and Walgreens as well.  </li>
            <li>read the reviews to make sure I knew what I was getting myself into.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, I dye my towels so it&#x27;s more of a hassle.</li>
            <li>I love this product, everytime i have a breakout moment i use it</li>
            <li>Ordered this product for my grandaughter and she was pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>Works but way too many chemicals.  </li>
            <li>Many have indicated that this is a drying product.</li>
            <li>Much better than all the OTC products we have ever tried.</li>
            <li>After reading up some more of the ACV, someone mentioned Panoxyl and how they heard Dr Oz mention it too.</li>
            <li>So I thought ok let&#x27;s look for it.</li>
            <li>my skin was peeling flaking and i was breaking out more.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great substitute, but I highly recommend the PanOxyl bar.</li>
            <li>The soap keeps the acne at bay, it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, but most impressively:  a bar lasts forever.</li>
            <li>Loved it, noticed a difference after the first use.</li>
            <li>I still get minor break outs, but a Great Help!</li>
            <li>the panoxyl bar worked wonderfully at keeping my acne from coming back, and making my skin smooth.</li>
            <li>Glad I found it on amazon, once again I&#x27;m breakout free....</li>
            <li>It can be drying and I have to use an oil free lotion, but my skin looks so much better when I use this.</li>
            <li>This stuff more than quadruples that... i can use this on my body as much as iwant though and it doesn&#x27;t overdry it, it just clears everything up, i love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I make my own DIY AHA moisturizer with rose water, pure AHA, and sweet almond oil.</li>
            <li>Great product that i have used for nearly 30 years to keep face free of oil.  </li>
            <li>I liked the product so much I wanted to purchase more PanOxyl.</li>
            <li>This may be to strong for my skin.</li>
            <li>and I would say that it is pretty effective to a degree.  </li>
            <li>It has made my skin bright and shinny, and prevented forming new acnes.</li>
            <li>and you will be fine.</li>
            <li>In less than 2 months, I was perfectly cleared up.</li>
            <li>This is an awesome little bar.</li>
            <li>The only time you need prescription meds that use this is when the delivery method is (somewhat) more effective at delivering more medicine at once or making it work longer by adding something to keep it from drying out too quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now I have been acne free for almost a year.</li>
            <li>I think Benzoyl Peroxide is great as a topical cream that you let sit on your face all night.</li>
            <li>However I don&#x27;t find that it leaves my skin 100% blemish free.</li>
            <li>If you have acne you know how important that is.</li>
            <li>and then but this has been such a wonderful product to really, really keep it under control.</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>so right now my skin is just looking a bit better</li>
            <li>Very good product, lasts longer than gel or other products for acnea.  </li>
            <li>They recommend the Panoxyl 10 foam which works great also, in fact it&#x27;s just like this product except a foam, only problem is it costs much more and runs out really fast!  </li>
            <li>Perhaps it was the kind of makeup I was using, or the change in the weather, or the fact that since I&#x27;m getting older, my body chemistry is changing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it though because of the results!</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft and smooth and I just love it!</li>
            <li>This stuff is so sought after that there was a shortage last year for it and people were successfully selling bars for 100</li>
            <li>I know it hasn&#x27;t even been a week since I started this product so if anything changes I will come back and update my review, but so far this stuff is WONDERFUL!!!</li>
            <li>This is by far the best thing I&#x27;ve used to treat breakouts and my shoulders and face are all cleared up after only two days.</li>
            <li>It lathers well, apply to face, and rinse clean.</li>
            <li>This is works great, since using this my acne is under control, the only thing is I have to wash my face with it every 3 days because of the strong medicine in it but its great to bath with everyday</li>
            <li>Strong chemicals like this only make my face produce more oil and eventually breaks out more than before.</li>
            <li>I was prescribed this soap, along with tablets, a special shampoo and a cream.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out and it is very effective.</li>
            <li>OK I admit I used to be a splish-splash kind of face washer until a friend reminded me how long doctors take washing their hands to get rid of germs/bacteria</li>
            <li>I read the reviews on this product on Walgreens&#x27; website, but even on that website it had almost full stars.</li>
            <li>I have to make sure that I rinse very well</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product, it is very drying</li>
            <li>Overall I think it does a good job of cleaning and removing dirt and oil.</li>
            <li>I thought I was paying 1/10 the price when I bought this, because of that old memory, and because of that, I found their customer service to be efficient, helpful, and courteous.</li>
            <li>The skin feels great after the bath and it smells very fresh too (little hint of peroxide).</li>
            <li>Now, 16 yrs later, the fight is easier to win thanks to this soap.&lt;br /&gt;Warning:</li>
            <li>It acts as a bit of a mild peel.</li>
            <li>Overall I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li>I tried some other benzoyl peroxide soaps, but this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>And very fast time!</li>
            <li>works great on my daughter&#x27;s black heads along with her prescription medication.</li>
            <li>This soap was much too strong for my skin</li>
            <li>I love it so far!</li>
            <li>Pretty skin after!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be back for more!</li>
            <li>but you must have a great moisturiser as it dries you out a little.</li>
            <li>Nothing short of amazing, but I already knew that before purchasing from Amazon as I am a frequent user of the soap :)</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve noticed I rarely even get any zits at all.</li>
            <li>and it has work great so far and have only been using it for 3 weeks now.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve honestly used this product for my facial acne since my dermatologist gave me a prescription for it for about 30 years ago.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>A bit pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li>If your face is on the sensitive side, use this product once ever couple of days, and as you build up a tolerance, use it more often.</li>
            <li>I just really hope this continues To work cuz it would really help to boost up my confidence once more.</li>
            <li>so I started off only using this product once a day followed by a really good FACIAL moisturizer and within the first week, I noticed a HUGE improvement!</li>
            <li>It killed my body acne better than this and it makes me super smoooooth :-).</li>
            <li>Moderate or light spots I think would would be easily handled by thus</li>
            <li>and I am going to try using this again now that my problem is much more mild than it was back then.</li>
            <li>In a week I have used a fair amount of the bar, but I figure maybe a bar every month to month and half.</li>
            <li>this is the only product that is gentle yet effective on body acne.</li>
            <li>The PanOxyl Bar 10% - 4 oz - 1 Bar is good and effective for its intended use but too expensive.</li>
            <li>Very very Upset.</li>
            <li>I like the product very much.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t remember the last time I had so many zits on my forehead and cheeks.</li>
            <li>I shower pretty often, but even showering immediately after exercise didn&#x27;t seem to help at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So, as you can imagine, I was pretty upset when I heard it was discontinued.  </li>
            <li>how much clearer my face could be!</li>
            <li>After the first two nights, I noticed that the bumps on my chest where gone.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how well and fast this soap worked!</li>
            <li>First got it by PRESCRIPTION from a dermatologist.</li>
            <li>He said I should be able to find locally.  </li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t even really need it!</li>
            <li>so really happy so far with this as am finally starting to see a spot clear face.</li>
            <li>Glad its back.</li>
            <li>my skin has become rather oily and this really helps balance my skin!</li>
            <li>Just need to make sure you use white towels.</li>
            <li>the first week</li>
            <li>This product has NOT been discontinued and should be available in stores near the end of October.  </li>
            <li>I did some research and found some in stock at MedShop Express (Qty: 93 to be exact).  </li>
            <li>I recommend using this first before heading to your dermatologist</li>
            <li>which more than likely, he/</li>
            <li>Love this product for my back but probably not for my nose.</li>
            <li>This is my first Review on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have used so many products and this is a trial period for this one, because I had initially bough Ambi to fade my hyperpigmentation from the acne scars that I have on my face.  </li>
            <li>or so i do admit your face does bring up a few pimples and impurities, but it gets soooo much better right after!!</li>
            <li>Be sure to use sunscreen while using this product to protect your new, sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Per the customer service rep, they experienced raw material shortages from their supplier, however, the problem has since been resolved with new shipments expect to go out to stores on 10/8.</li>
            <li>so I went out and tried clean and clear.</li>
            <li>but i can endure it for a nice, soft back without acne.</li>
            <li>i gave it 2 stars because the shipping was fast and the product was exactly what was ordered.</li>
            <li>The people that say it does not bleach their stuff must have only white linens or are excellent at making sure they leave no residue behind.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and definitely make sure that you wear a moisturizer/sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>If you use it more than that, it&#x27;ll dry your skin out.</li>
            <li>Note that this soap does over dry the skin, so be sure to use a moisturizer after use.</li>
            <li>Either way, I cannot rate this product very highly for what it did to my face.</li>
            <li>and it really works for me,</li>
            <li>This bar works really well.</li>
            <li>My skin was really oily.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t want to take an antibiotic</li>
            <li>PanOxl bar used to be available locally, but my drug store stopped carrying it.  </li>
            <li>I had been using it for a couple years straight with no acne flair ups at all and had a week where I lapsed in having any</li>
            <li>I used it and it worked really well</li>
            <li>, it really dries your skin out so</li>
            <li>and it really has made an improvement</li>
            <li>You&#x27;d think that at some point in my 33 years that acne would cease to be a real problem.  </li>
            <li>Untreated, not a chance, but PanOxyl really really helps.  </li>
            <li>No matter how much it is, buy it.</li>
            <li>It works very well and can be a bit drying.</li>
            <li>He said \\&quot;No, but thanks for the heads</li>
            <li>not to knock the product, but the people selling these items are charging way to much.</li>
            <li>like you&#x27;ve tried everything and nothing really works.</li>
            <li>Just be sure to wash it completely off your face once your done, thats the only way that youmight experience irritation</li>
            <li>I found not as good on my face as other areas as the extra drying really really hurts on my face.</li>
            <li>First is always what you eat and how you live... but no soapboxes here, just the soap</li>
            <li>and I should know, I have everything from clean &amp; clear to neutrogena in my bathroom but this product beats all of them by far and it was priced at around $8.</li>
            <li>wait 20 minutes, then moisturize with Clean and Clear Dual Action moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>By day 6 (today), my face and neck are incredibly smoother with only a few bumps remaining (which you can barely see).</li>
            <li>Significant improvement on my son&#x27;s back acne.</li>
            <li>product works better for me than any other acne/face soap that I have ever used.</li>
            <li>The most I can use this bar is once a day every other day in the colder months and once a day every day in warmer months.  </li>
            <li>PanOxyl works every bit as well as my prescription cleansers (at a sixth of the cost) and a hundred times better than the other stuff.  </li>
            <li>Other than that it works great for all the other areas I needed.</li>
            <li>I hope to update my review in a few weeks-months with more positive results.  </li>
            <li>I swear by PanOxyl and will continue to use it as long as it is available.</li>
            <li>Hopefully this is true and the product will be back on my drug store shelves soon!</li>
            <li>I purchased this item for butt acne, which is something that has happened as I have gotten older.</li>
            <li>decent product, will use it again.</li>
            <li>i have been suffering from spots on my face (mainly cheeks and chin) for 3 years now</li>
            <li>I have tried many different acne cleansers for both my face and back and ethier</li>
            <li>I would HIGHLY recommend this product to anyone suffering from body acne.   </li>
            <li>Prompt delivery coupled with a high quality product hit the spot.</li>
            <li>As a bonus, it&#x27;s also helped clear my skin up really well.</li>
            <li>but I would be hesitant to use it on the face because it is drying and makes you very sun sensitive.</li>
            <li>and I really DON&#x27;T have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Be sure to use this ONLY at night for the first few days until you figure out how much it dries out your skin.</li>
            <li>I thought my face was purging, but it didn&#x27;t look like normal acne.</li>
            <li>If your body is not working with the normal stuff you find at drug stores, give this a try before seeing a dermatologist.</li>
            <li>While the product is very good the cost of one bar was ridiculous, so I sent it back to buy it locally!</li>
            <li>I have a medical condition that causes me to be more prone to acne than the average adult and this product really does work!</li>
            <li>Its so good, its hard for the local stores to keep in stock</li>
            <li>I used to be ugly and pimply now I am fresh and fly.</li>
            <li>I bought one bar from the store and in 3 days my skin was clear and stayed clear the whole time.</li>
            <li>The products that take 3 steps of washing and applying different liquids take an extremely long time and it&#x27;s easy to skip a day or two.  </li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>Plus it hasn&#x27;t bothered my sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>but it is the same exact product) for about $8.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You can purchase the SAME EXACT Product line at WALMART, CVS, Walgreen&#x27;s, and Rite-Aid.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am holding out hope as I have never seen a product reviewed so consistently well by people who seem to have similar acne stories.  </li>
            <li>And dry your face with a white towel or you will have bleach spots all over your pretty new colorful towels, like me.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper &amp; just as effective to use black tar or black coal soap.</li>
            <li>Be aware that it takes a couple weeks of daily use to clear up a breakout.</li>
            <li>Although the price is much higher than it really should be, the bar seems to last several months.</li>
            <li>Really helped clear up my skin!!&lt;br /&gt;Did dry up my skin a bit though but really helped with my body acne.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The good news is that many other brands have products with the same active ingredient of Benzoyl Peroxide 10%, or lesser strengths if this is too harsh.  </li>
            <li>Price being offered by various Independent Vendors on the Amazon site is HIGH WAY ROBBERY !!!</li>
            <li>I bought this for my sister who suffers from acne on her face and body at 26 and her skin looks great</li>
            <li>I remained perfectly clear until the soap finished.</li>
            <li>and i have not once had a clear face.</li>
            <li>I had to come here and order this after searching for 2 years to clear my skin up.</li>
            <li>If you want to clear your skin up, order this.</li>
            <li>Keeps my skin clear.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll kill bacteria and clear you</li>
            <li>I noticed it did clear out a bit</li>
            <li>Not my much, but they are different.</li>
            <li>I found using a facial complexion brush encourages one to really massage and cleanse the skin and pores for the recommended 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>family has used PanOxyl Acne Cleansing Bar off and on for years on Pharmacist&#x27;s recommendation BEFORE Benzoyl Peroxide was deemed the acne cure-all in nearly ALL acne preparations.</li>
            <li>My back has already cleared very  well.</li>
            <li>It completely cleared up my acne on those parts of my body and kept it clear.  </li>
            <li>Used it twice in three days &amp; my skin was completely fried.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have much of a problem with pimples before and only bought the soap to make the skin a bit smoother.</li>
            <li>I am in early 30s, and have always struggled with acne breakouts since my teens.  </li>
            <li>My son&#x27;s dermatologist recommended for my 13 year old.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s rather sensitive</li>
            <li>and I started breaking out, which I was completely unused to by this time.</li>
            <li>My skin pretty much stayed cleared but recently, I had to switch birth control pills which made me have some minor breakouts.  </li>
            <li>for me, I have very oily skin, and drying my skin out is definitely a plus!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;To get the most benefit out of it, use this with an exfoliating rag or pad and let the soap absorb into your skin for at least a minute before rinsing off.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m 22 years old,</li>
            <li>ly 15 year old son and he.actually uses it.</li>
            <li>Box completely Worn Out.</li>
            <li>I do see some clearing; however, my chin frequently has pimples that develop and retreat without ever popping.</li>
            <li>I do have somewhat sensitive skin though</li>
            <li>Bought after recommended by the 80+ year old Dermatologist, for my son.</li>
            <li>It takes a few weeks for you to really see results but it is worth using once a day.</li>
            <li>good product, but too expensive.</li>
            <li>soap comes in a little plastic soap dish with a clear lid, so it is clean and self</li>
            <li>Granted their distribution center is out of stock right now</li>
            <li>If you tend to have dry skin on your face, you may want to try the 5% first.  </li>
            <li>this was hard to find for a while so the price was a bit high since this can be bought on the shelf (when available) for $6</li>
            <li>So I am horrified to say I have skin that is not just sensitive, but likes to get big bumps (particularly on my underarms)</li>
            <li>Using this daily on just my back keeps it pretty clear.  </li>
            <li>But really, who feels like forking up 40 bucks on the copayment to get an anti-biotic and cream that takes so long to kick in.  </li>
            <li>IF it doesn&#x27;t dry you out too much you can use it twice a day.</li>
            <li>There is no reason to spend this much money on this product when you can buy essentially the same thing for a fraction of the cost.  </li>
            <li>Never a better product and have attempted others when originally discontinued and NO COMPARISON.  </li>
            <li>I trust no other product than panoxyl.</li>
            <li>This cleared up my skin when no other body wash could.</li>
            <li>a soap, it doesn&#x27;t sit long enough to kill much more bacteria than regular soap; however, all that 10% BP dripping down your face will bleach your towels, carpet, and clothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been using for 8 days (once a day) on my under arms (not using it on my face, dont really need it) and other sensitive places prone to acne.</li>
            <li>I was using twice a day but my skin started getting tight and dry, so one application seems to work just fine.</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin clear and doesn&#x27;t dry my very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>If I get too dry sometimes due to weather changes or washing my face too much, I switch to my Cetaphil gentle cleanser.</li>
            <li>If you have problems with acne scars and acne in general.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking to try this out in general, the bar is the way to go.</li>
            <li>And FAST!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a 27 year old female.</li>
            <li>When I turned 25 I got \\&quot;Adult Cystic Acne\\&quot; on my back, arms, &amp; chest area.</li>
            <li>They were barely visible anymore, but this has brought every one of those to a whitehead</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been so self conscious and it does take a toll on your emotions especially feeling</li>
            <li>You have to endure things getting worse before they get better plus drys you out and dyes fabrics.</li>
            <li>It is as pure as acne medications can be without fragrance or other additives so doesn&#x27;t solve one problem and create another one for my allergy-sensistive skin.</li>
            <li>Topix, Clean and Clear, and Glytone are examples of other products with the same active ingredient.</li>
            <li>The skin around the corners of my mouth got really really dry and started peeling (it&#x27;s very red) - that&#x27;s very visible and the problem is still there although I only used the bar like 4 times on the face and haven&#x27;t used it for 3 days anymore.</li>
            <li>So after recently checking every store (Walgreens, Walmart, CVS, RiteAid, Dollar General, etc.)</li>
            <li>Since the PanOxyl bar has apparently been discontinued with no return in sight (they even removed the space on the shelf for it at my local Walgreens!</li>
            <li>I would describe my skin as sensitive but it is not extremely sensitive like some folks I know.  </li>
            <li>I am a 24 year old male with folliculitis on my chest and some acne on my back, and this definitely cleared things up.</li>
            <li>Recently I had been having major stress breakouts on my cheaks, forehead and chin and was recommended this soap along with Clindamycin topical medication.</li>
            <li>and if you use a towel to dry off or wearing clothes when you wash your face and don&#x27;t wash it off completely you have a chance of semi-bleaching the towel or clothes.</li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t notice any changes, and it was causing any flaking and it didn&#x27;t really feel like a medication, but today, in my 4th or 5th day of using it, it has broken through my oily skin</li>
            <li>Pimples started popping up, a new one every other day.  </li>
            <li>If I do happen to use this on my face though, a mild, low percentage AHA moisturizer (right after a shower and just before the oil gets to pumping like crazy) helps me avoid mass amounts of oil.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> If all I have to do is use this soap and sea breeze I will be happy.</li>
            <li> lol.</li>

            <li> , i also think that for me its great because now that i have turned 20</li>

            <li> This stuff works great.</li>
            <li> This is clearing up my skin very nicely.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m seeing amazing differences!</li>
            <li> AMAZING!  </li>
            <li> I would also make sure to use the bar as that has seemed to have the best results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m wondering if anyone knows of any good alternatives?</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it works that good.  </li>
            <li> Even using a good lotion after application made no difference.</li>
            <li> It is a bit drying, but just get some good lotion</li>
            <li> So its good stuff.</li>
            <li> This was good.</li>
            <li> I have fair skin</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t bleach my sheets or clothes and follow up with a good moisturizer, depending on the weather.</li>
            <li> , I am good to go.</li>
            <li> good luck</li>
            <li> good shipping.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m still trying to find a good moisturizer to help with that.</li>
            <li> So if anyone can recommend a good one for oily skin that would help.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m happy and my skin is much better now.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So I am very glad I found it on amazon.  </li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I was even able to change from a coverup foundation to just a tinted moisturizer with vitamins in it!</li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> What is so great about the bar is that it is really EASY to use it every day.  </li>
            <li> I think this product is amazing.</li>
            <li> I am so happy this is available again.</li>
            <li> My skin looks absolutely amazing, I just had to write a review.</li>
            <li> The kind of zits that are stubborn too, they returned over and over again.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, most of us just need a good soap for the morning, after work, and bedtime.  </li>
            <li> The medication in the soap is great at clearing up blemishes, and better yet, prevents break-outs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tend to have oily skin on my face, but using PanOxl soap in the morning and at night prevents my face from becoming shiney.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend to anyone unless they have very, very strong skin.</li>
            <li> I am so glad because I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> However, it is the best thing that I have found thus far.</li>
            <li> So far I am over whelmed with relief and joy, I wont be embarrassed to wear sleeveless shirts this summer!!  </li>
            <li> This is by far the best product I have found to control my acne.</li>
            <li> Not the most effective bar.</li>
            <li> I am sure this bar will work miracles for most, but those of you who have some more sensitive skin like mine, try the Face Wash instead, it works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> itself.&lt;br /&gt;Benzoyl Peroxide is a near-miracle medicine, as it works for most acne sufferers without prescriptions.  </li>
            <li> I have only been using it at night and have been very impressed.  </li>
            <li> My athletic teenager&#x27;s back-ne has responded better to this than liquid Benzoyl Peroxide washes, gels, ointments.</li>
            <li> This product is perhaps the greatest I ever used on my chest and back.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years and absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend leaving in on for any more than a minute before washing it off.</li>
            <li> After reading all the reports that this product was discontinued I decided to go to the source and find out for sure.  </li>
            <li> He also specifically told me NOT to use it on my face, as you could gather from many of these reviews.</li>
            <li> Love this for using once a week on my body.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it on my face but it does an awesome job and keeping away pimples on my back or chest.</li>
            <li> gave my skin a rash, this is supposed to cure acne or to give you more acne?</li>
            <li> This is the best working product, I use it to wash shoulders, neck, back, face twice a day</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li> Glad to see that it is carried on amazon.</li>
            <li> Nothing I have tried has worked like this, the closest thing I was doing was literally using my biore face wash (which I LOVE fyi for my face) on my underarms, but I was still getting these bumps.</li>
            <li> and I find it works so much better than Proactive.</li>
            <li> I ordered this to try it on my acne, it was ok, made my skin peel from dryness but still remained oily and had pimples...</li>
            <li> I always buy multiples of this bar to make sure I have some to use as a couple days without this you will notice some flare ups appearing.</li>
            <li> I wish more stores carried this product.  </li>
            <li> I bought this at wal-mart while i was out after reading many reviews on it</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I love this bar.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been able to find this at CVS and Walgreens as well.  </li>
            <li> read the reviews to make sure I knew what I was getting myself into.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, I dye my towels so it&#x27;s more of a hassle.</li>
            <li> I love this product, everytime i have a breakout moment i use it</li>
            <li> Ordered this product for my grandaughter and she was pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> Works but way too many chemicals.  </li>
            <li> Many have indicated that this is a drying product.</li>
            <li> Much better than all the OTC products we have ever tried.</li>
            <li> After reading up some more of the ACV, someone mentioned Panoxyl and how they heard Dr Oz mention it too.</li>
            <li> So I thought ok let&#x27;s look for it.</li>
            <li> my skin was peeling flaking and i was breaking out more.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great substitute, but I highly recommend the PanOxyl bar.</li>
            <li> The soap keeps the acne at bay, it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, but most impressively:  a bar lasts forever.</li>
            <li> Loved it, noticed a difference after the first use.</li>
            <li> I still get minor break outs, but a Great Help!</li>
            <li> the panoxyl bar worked wonderfully at keeping my acne from coming back, and making my skin smooth.</li>
            <li> Glad I found it on amazon, once again I&#x27;m breakout free....</li>
            <li> It can be drying and I have to use an oil free lotion, but my skin looks so much better when I use this.</li>
            <li> This stuff more than quadruples that... i can use this on my body as much as iwant though and it doesn&#x27;t overdry it, it just clears everything up, i love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I make my own DIY AHA moisturizer with rose water, pure AHA, and sweet almond oil.</li>
            <li> Great product that i have used for nearly 30 years to keep face free of oil.  </li>
            <li> I liked the product so much I wanted to purchase more PanOxyl.</li>
            <li> This may be to strong for my skin.</li>
            <li> and I would say that it is pretty effective to a degree.  </li>
            <li> It has made my skin bright and shinny, and prevented forming new acnes.</li>
            <li> and you will be fine.</li>
            <li> In less than 2 months, I was perfectly cleared up.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome little bar.</li>
            <li> The only time you need prescription meds that use this is when the delivery method is (somewhat) more effective at delivering more medicine at once or making it work longer by adding something to keep it from drying out too quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now I have been acne free for almost a year.</li>
            <li> I think Benzoyl Peroxide is great as a topical cream that you let sit on your face all night.</li>
            <li> However I don&#x27;t find that it leaves my skin 100% blemish free.</li>
            <li> If you have acne you know how important that is.</li>
            <li> and then but this has been such a wonderful product to really, really keep it under control.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> so right now my skin is just looking a bit better</li>
            <li> Very good product, lasts longer than gel or other products for acnea.  </li>
            <li> They recommend the Panoxyl 10 foam which works great also, in fact it&#x27;s just like this product except a foam, only problem is it costs much more and runs out really fast!  </li>
            <li> Perhaps it was the kind of makeup I was using, or the change in the weather, or the fact that since I&#x27;m getting older, my body chemistry is changing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it though because of the results!</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft and smooth and I just love it!</li>
            <li> This stuff is so sought after that there was a shortage last year for it and people were successfully selling bars for 100</li>
            <li> I know it hasn&#x27;t even been a week since I started this product so if anything changes I will come back and update my review, but so far this stuff is WONDERFUL!!!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best thing I&#x27;ve used to treat breakouts and my shoulders and face are all cleared up after only two days.</li>
            <li> It lathers well, apply to face, and rinse clean.</li>
            <li> This is works great, since using this my acne is under control, the only thing is I have to wash my face with it every 3 days because of the strong medicine in it but its great to bath with everyday</li>
            <li> Strong chemicals like this only make my face produce more oil and eventually breaks out more than before.</li>
            <li> I was prescribed this soap, along with tablets, a special shampoo and a cream.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out and it is very effective.</li>
            <li> OK I admit I used to be a splish-splash kind of face washer until a friend reminded me how long doctors take washing their hands to get rid of germs/bacteria</li>
            <li> I read the reviews on this product on Walgreens&#x27; website, but even on that website it had almost full stars.</li>
            <li> I have to make sure that I rinse very well</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product, it is very drying</li>
            <li> Overall I think it does a good job of cleaning and removing dirt and oil.</li>
            <li> I thought I was paying 1/10 the price when I bought this, because of that old memory, and because of that, I found their customer service to be efficient, helpful, and courteous.</li>
            <li> The skin feels great after the bath and it smells very fresh too (little hint of peroxide).</li>
            <li> Now, 16 yrs later, the fight is easier to win thanks to this soap.&lt;br /&gt;Warning:</li>
            <li> It acts as a bit of a mild peel.</li>
            <li> Overall I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I tried some other benzoyl peroxide soaps, but this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> And very fast time!</li>
            <li> works great on my daughter&#x27;s black heads along with her prescription medication.</li>
            <li> This soap was much too strong for my skin</li>
            <li> I love it so far!</li>
            <li> Pretty skin after!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be back for more!</li>
            <li> but you must have a great moisturiser as it dries you out a little.</li>
            <li> Nothing short of amazing, but I already knew that before purchasing from Amazon as I am a frequent user of the soap :)</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve noticed I rarely even get any zits at all.</li>
            <li> and it has work great so far and have only been using it for 3 weeks now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve honestly used this product for my facial acne since my dermatologist gave me a prescription for it for about 30 years ago.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> A bit pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li> If your face is on the sensitive side, use this product once ever couple of days, and as you build up a tolerance, use it more often.</li>
            <li> I just really hope this continues To work cuz it would really help to boost up my confidence once more.</li>
            <li> so I started off only using this product once a day followed by a really good FACIAL moisturizer and within the first week, I noticed a HUGE improvement!</li>
            <li> It killed my body acne better than this and it makes me super smoooooth :-).</li>
            <li> Moderate or light spots I think would would be easily handled by thus</li>
            <li> and I am going to try using this again now that my problem is much more mild than it was back then.</li>
            <li> In a week I have used a fair amount of the bar, but I figure maybe a bar every month to month and half.</li>
            <li> this is the only product that is gentle yet effective on body acne.</li>
            <li> The PanOxyl Bar 10% - 4 oz - 1 Bar is good and effective for its intended use but too expensive.</li>
            <li> Very very Upset.</li>
            <li> I like the product very much.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t remember the last time I had so many zits on my forehead and cheeks.</li>
            <li> I shower pretty often, but even showering immediately after exercise didn&#x27;t seem to help at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So, as you can imagine, I was pretty upset when I heard it was discontinued.  </li>
            <li> how much clearer my face could be!</li>
            <li> After the first two nights, I noticed that the bumps on my chest where gone.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how well and fast this soap worked!</li>
            <li> First got it by PRESCRIPTION from a dermatologist.</li>
            <li> He said I should be able to find locally.  </li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t even really need it!</li>
            <li> so really happy so far with this as am finally starting to see a spot clear face.</li>
            <li> Glad its back.</li>
            <li> my skin has become rather oily and this really helps balance my skin!</li>
            <li> Just need to make sure you use white towels.</li>
            <li> the first week</li>
            <li> This product has NOT been discontinued and should be available in stores near the end of October.  </li>
            <li> I did some research and found some in stock at MedShop Express (Qty: 93 to be exact).  </li>
            <li> I recommend using this first before heading to your dermatologist</li>
            <li> which more than likely, he/</li>
            <li> Love this product for my back but probably not for my nose.</li>
            <li> This is my first Review on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have used so many products and this is a trial period for this one, because I had initially bough Ambi to fade my hyperpigmentation from the acne scars that I have on my face.  </li>
            <li> or so i do admit your face does bring up a few pimples and impurities, but it gets soooo much better right after!!</li>
            <li> Be sure to use sunscreen while using this product to protect your new, sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Per the customer service rep, they experienced raw material shortages from their supplier, however, the problem has since been resolved with new shipments expect to go out to stores on 10/8.</li>
            <li> so I went out and tried clean and clear.</li>
            <li> but i can endure it for a nice, soft back without acne.</li>
            <li> i gave it 2 stars because the shipping was fast and the product was exactly what was ordered.</li>
            <li> The people that say it does not bleach their stuff must have only white linens or are excellent at making sure they leave no residue behind.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and definitely make sure that you wear a moisturizer/sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> If you use it more than that, it&#x27;ll dry your skin out.</li>
            <li> Note that this soap does over dry the skin, so be sure to use a moisturizer after use.</li>
            <li> Either way, I cannot rate this product very highly for what it did to my face.</li>
            <li> and it really works for me,</li>
            <li> This bar works really well.</li>
            <li> My skin was really oily.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t want to take an antibiotic</li>
            <li> PanOxl bar used to be available locally, but my drug store stopped carrying it.  </li>
            <li> I had been using it for a couple years straight with no acne flair ups at all and had a week where I lapsed in having any</li>
            <li> I used it and it worked really well</li>
            <li> , it really dries your skin out so</li>
            <li> and it really has made an improvement</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d think that at some point in my 33 years that acne would cease to be a real problem.  </li>
            <li> Untreated, not a chance, but PanOxyl really really helps.  </li>
            <li> No matter how much it is, buy it.</li>
            <li> It works very well and can be a bit drying.</li>
            <li> He said \\&quot;No, but thanks for the heads</li>
            <li> not to knock the product, but the people selling these items are charging way to much.</li>
            <li> like you&#x27;ve tried everything and nothing really works.</li>
            <li> Just be sure to wash it completely off your face once your done, thats the only way that youmight experience irritation</li>
            <li> I found not as good on my face as other areas as the extra drying really really hurts on my face.</li>
            <li> First is always what you eat and how you live... but no soapboxes here, just the soap</li>
            <li> and I should know, I have everything from clean &amp; clear to neutrogena in my bathroom but this product beats all of them by far and it was priced at around $8.</li>
            <li> wait 20 minutes, then moisturize with Clean and Clear Dual Action moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> By day 6 (today), my face and neck are incredibly smoother with only a few bumps remaining (which you can barely see).</li>
            <li> Significant improvement on my son&#x27;s back acne.</li>
            <li> product works better for me than any other acne/face soap that I have ever used.</li>
            <li> The most I can use this bar is once a day every other day in the colder months and once a day every day in warmer months.  </li>
            <li> PanOxyl works every bit as well as my prescription cleansers (at a sixth of the cost) and a hundred times better than the other stuff.  </li>
            <li> Other than that it works great for all the other areas I needed.</li>
            <li> I hope to update my review in a few weeks-months with more positive results.  </li>
            <li> I swear by PanOxyl and will continue to use it as long as it is available.</li>
            <li> Hopefully this is true and the product will be back on my drug store shelves soon!</li>
            <li> I purchased this item for butt acne, which is something that has happened as I have gotten older.</li>
            <li> decent product, will use it again.</li>
            <li> i have been suffering from spots on my face (mainly cheeks and chin) for 3 years now</li>
            <li> I have tried many different acne cleansers for both my face and back and ethier</li>
            <li> I would HIGHLY recommend this product to anyone suffering from body acne.   </li>
            <li> Prompt delivery coupled with a high quality product hit the spot.</li>
            <li> As a bonus, it&#x27;s also helped clear my skin up really well.</li>
            <li> but I would be hesitant to use it on the face because it is drying and makes you very sun sensitive.</li>
            <li> and I really DON&#x27;T have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Be sure to use this ONLY at night for the first few days until you figure out how much it dries out your skin.</li>
            <li> I thought my face was purging, but it didn&#x27;t look like normal acne.</li>
            <li> If your body is not working with the normal stuff you find at drug stores, give this a try before seeing a dermatologist.</li>
            <li> While the product is very good the cost of one bar was ridiculous, so I sent it back to buy it locally!</li>
            <li> I have a medical condition that causes me to be more prone to acne than the average adult and this product really does work!</li>
            <li> Its so good, its hard for the local stores to keep in stock</li>
            <li> I used to be ugly and pimply now I am fresh and fly.</li>
            <li> I bought one bar from the store and in 3 days my skin was clear and stayed clear the whole time.</li>
            <li> The products that take 3 steps of washing and applying different liquids take an extremely long time and it&#x27;s easy to skip a day or two.  </li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> Plus it hasn&#x27;t bothered my sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> but it is the same exact product) for about $8.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You can purchase the SAME EXACT Product line at WALMART, CVS, Walgreen&#x27;s, and Rite-Aid.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am holding out hope as I have never seen a product reviewed so consistently well by people who seem to have similar acne stories.  </li>
            <li> And dry your face with a white towel or you will have bleach spots all over your pretty new colorful towels, like me.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper &amp; just as effective to use black tar or black coal soap.</li>
            <li> Be aware that it takes a couple weeks of daily use to clear up a breakout.</li>
            <li> Although the price is much higher than it really should be, the bar seems to last several months.</li>
            <li> Really helped clear up my skin!!&lt;br /&gt;Did dry up my skin a bit though but really helped with my body acne.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The good news is that many other brands have products with the same active ingredient of Benzoyl Peroxide 10%, or lesser strengths if this is too harsh.  </li>
            <li> Price being offered by various Independent Vendors on the Amazon site is HIGH WAY ROBBERY !!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my sister who suffers from acne on her face and body at 26 and her skin looks great</li>
            <li> I remained perfectly clear until the soap finished.</li>
            <li> and i have not once had a clear face.</li>
            <li> I had to come here and order this after searching for 2 years to clear my skin up.</li>
            <li> If you want to clear your skin up, order this.</li>
            <li> Keeps my skin clear.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll kill bacteria and clear you</li>
            <li> I noticed it did clear out a bit</li>
            <li> Not my much, but they are different.</li>
            <li> I found using a facial complexion brush encourages one to really massage and cleanse the skin and pores for the recommended 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> family has used PanOxyl Acne Cleansing Bar off and on for years on Pharmacist&#x27;s recommendation BEFORE Benzoyl Peroxide was deemed the acne cure-all in nearly ALL acne preparations.</li>
            <li> My back has already cleared very  well.</li>
            <li> It completely cleared up my acne on those parts of my body and kept it clear.  </li>
            <li> Used it twice in three days &amp; my skin was completely fried.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have much of a problem with pimples before and only bought the soap to make the skin a bit smoother.</li>
            <li> I am in early 30s, and have always struggled with acne breakouts since my teens.  </li>
            <li> My son&#x27;s dermatologist recommended for my 13 year old.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s rather sensitive</li>
            <li> and I started breaking out, which I was completely unused to by this time.</li>
            <li> My skin pretty much stayed cleared but recently, I had to switch birth control pills which made me have some minor breakouts.  </li>
            <li> for me, I have very oily skin, and drying my skin out is definitely a plus!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;To get the most benefit out of it, use this with an exfoliating rag or pad and let the soap absorb into your skin for at least a minute before rinsing off.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m 22 years old,</li>
            <li> ly 15 year old son and he.actually uses it.</li>
            <li> Box completely Worn Out.</li>
            <li> I do see some clearing; however, my chin frequently has pimples that develop and retreat without ever popping.</li>
            <li> I do have somewhat sensitive skin though</li>
            <li> Bought after recommended by the 80+ year old Dermatologist, for my son.</li>
            <li> It takes a few weeks for you to really see results but it is worth using once a day.</li>
            <li> good product, but too expensive.</li>
            <li> soap comes in a little plastic soap dish with a clear lid, so it is clean and self</li>
            <li> Granted their distribution center is out of stock right now</li>
            <li> If you tend to have dry skin on your face, you may want to try the 5% first.  </li>
            <li> this was hard to find for a while so the price was a bit high since this can be bought on the shelf (when available) for $6</li>
            <li> So I am horrified to say I have skin that is not just sensitive, but likes to get big bumps (particularly on my underarms)</li>
            <li> Using this daily on just my back keeps it pretty clear.  </li>
            <li> But really, who feels like forking up 40 bucks on the copayment to get an anti-biotic and cream that takes so long to kick in.  </li>
            <li> IF it doesn&#x27;t dry you out too much you can use it twice a day.</li>
            <li> There is no reason to spend this much money on this product when you can buy essentially the same thing for a fraction of the cost.  </li>
            <li> Never a better product and have attempted others when originally discontinued and NO COMPARISON.  </li>
            <li> I trust no other product than panoxyl.</li>
            <li> This cleared up my skin when no other body wash could.</li>
            <li> a soap, it doesn&#x27;t sit long enough to kill much more bacteria than regular soap; however, all that 10% BP dripping down your face will bleach your towels, carpet, and clothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using for 8 days (once a day) on my under arms (not using it on my face, dont really need it) and other sensitive places prone to acne.</li>
            <li> I was using twice a day but my skin started getting tight and dry, so one application seems to work just fine.</li>
            <li> It keeps my skin clear and doesn&#x27;t dry my very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> If I get too dry sometimes due to weather changes or washing my face too much, I switch to my Cetaphil gentle cleanser.</li>
            <li> If you have problems with acne scars and acne in general.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking to try this out in general, the bar is the way to go.</li>
            <li> And FAST!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a 27 year old female.</li>
            <li> When I turned 25 I got \\&quot;Adult Cystic Acne\\&quot; on my back, arms, &amp; chest area.</li>
            <li> They were barely visible anymore, but this has brought every one of those to a whitehead</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been so self conscious and it does take a toll on your emotions especially feeling</li>
            <li> You have to endure things getting worse before they get better plus drys you out and dyes fabrics.</li>
            <li> It is as pure as acne medications can be without fragrance or other additives so doesn&#x27;t solve one problem and create another one for my allergy-sensistive skin.</li>
            <li> Topix, Clean and Clear, and Glytone are examples of other products with the same active ingredient.</li>
            <li> The skin around the corners of my mouth got really really dry and started peeling (it&#x27;s very red) - that&#x27;s very visible and the problem is still there although I only used the bar like 4 times on the face and haven&#x27;t used it for 3 days anymore.</li>
            <li> So after recently checking every store (Walgreens, Walmart, CVS, RiteAid, Dollar General, etc.)</li>
            <li> Since the PanOxyl bar has apparently been discontinued with no return in sight (they even removed the space on the shelf for it at my local Walgreens!</li>
            <li> I would describe my skin as sensitive but it is not extremely sensitive like some folks I know.  </li>
            <li> I am a 24 year old male with folliculitis on my chest and some acne on my back, and this definitely cleared things up.</li>
            <li> Recently I had been having major stress breakouts on my cheaks, forehead and chin and was recommended this soap along with Clindamycin topical medication.</li>
            <li> and if you use a towel to dry off or wearing clothes when you wash your face and don&#x27;t wash it off completely you have a chance of semi-bleaching the towel or clothes.</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t notice any changes, and it was causing any flaking and it didn&#x27;t really feel like a medication, but today, in my 4th or 5th day of using it, it has broken through my oily skin</li>
            <li> Pimples started popping up, a new one every other day.  </li>
            <li> If I do happen to use this on my face though, a mild, low percentage AHA moisturizer (right after a shower and just before the oil gets to pumping like crazy) helps me avoid mass amounts of oil.</li>
            <li> The normal price is less than ten dollars.</li>
            <li> I mean this is powerful stuff.</li>
            <li> I picked up the PanOxyl 10% Bar when I couldn&#x27;t find the Foaming Wash at my local Wal-Mart which usually has the Foaming Wash of the same type, which I am still an enormous fan of, at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> and we washed it down with this, and before going to bed just got my finger wet and rubbed the bar lightly to get a little lather on the bar, applied it to her face and literally any trace of it</li>
            <li> Today, I went to Walgreens and happened to stumble into the face/body wash (essentially acne) area, and saw a tag for this bar!  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re just starting it you want to not leave it on as long.</li>
            <li> I have long hair as well, so as a result I have been breaking out on my back.</li>
            <li> After using it twice a day for the last three days, the minor breakouts have disappeared and the blemishes are fading.  </li>
            <li> Took a few weeks for my skin to peel &amp; return to its normal condition.</li>
            <li> Currently, I wash with the bar, pat dry and leave for 10 minutes,</li>
            <li> When you scrub on face for over 1 minute you have such a dry feel film for over 30 minutes, ewwww</li>
            <li> I can remember paying less than 2 bucks a bar at local drug stores when it still was in the red, white and blue box.</li>
            <li> My skin on my shoulders never dried out but using it on my face with other medications made it a little dry, so I put some aloe on to moisturize and also help clear up the acne.</li>
            <li> Works very well but is hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m afraid of it blocking out my pores and making more pimples.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell if this soap is working or not yet, but it has bleached my dark blue washcloths to be completely white in some spots which makes me nervous to use on my skin.  </li>
            <li> OR how long you&#x27;re supposed to brush your teeth.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin--using this twice a day for several days I noticed patches of skin were rough.</li>
            <li> And it lasts quite a long time since it is in bar form.</li>
            <li> soap bar lasts a long time, and clears your skin.</li>
            <li> At first, it actually got worse</li>
            <li> The tiny ones on my forehead are now just tiny dark marks and the white head ones are gone and are now just kinda dark reds.</li>
            <li> If you have tried other products with Benzoyl Peroxide in it and don&#x27;t think it will be any different</li>
            <li> Product fell in short supply (temporarily) due to ingredient shortages.</li>
            <li> When that happens, those little red monsters start invading your facial space again.  </li>
            <li> I am under the impression that the medication&#x27;s tendency to dry the skin accelerated oil production.</li>
            <li> Any longer and you will dry yourself to the point of redness.</li>
            <li> It made my face and décolleté really dry and provoked pimples.</li>
            <li> It has seemed to dry out my complexion without being too damaging.  </li>
            <li> It can dry your face out, it started to dry mine out</li>
            <li> you get dry skin and a bit redness</li>
            <li> /&gt;Use a moisturizer as well as this will dry the hell out of your skin without it.</li>
            <li> If you have consistently dry skin, I would not recommend this as it will dry your skin</li>
            <li> it can dry out your skin, depending on your skin type.</li>
            <li> It did dry out my skin around the mouth area</li>
            <li> I have since switched back to the PanOxyl Foaming Face Wash of the same grade and my skin has started clearing up again within a matter of a few days which makes me think something about the bar, whatever it was, just didn&#x27;t get along with my skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m fairly active and do a lot of physical activity.</li>
            <li> But the vendor charges the case price for a single bar.</li>
            <li> only down side is</li>
            <li> and if you do get a lot of redness try and not put it on for couple of days until red calms down.</li>
            <li> I simply cut down how often I used the soap.&lt;br</li>
            <li> caution can cause a little dryness if left on skin too long.</li>
            <li> I have used this once a day and have only seen a slight improvement.</li>
            <li> However, it does dry out my face - with a little help from a facial moisturizer</li>
            <li> it slooowwwly gets ri of the black marks from the blackheads but not fast enough</li>
            <li> I stopped using certain hair products and makeup to see if that was causing it, but the bumps stayed and got worse no matter what I tried.</li>
            <li> but if you use a small amount of retinol cream at a weak percentage in conjunction with a moisturising soap and the panoxyl I seem to have found a consistent routine that actually works.</li>
            <li> , package looks just a little different</li>
            <li> Definitely do need to use on a regular basis though, at least every-other day.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how long we&#x27;ll be able to afford buying this product. :(</li>
            <li> I have never had severe acne problems, i have few blemishes on my back</li>
            <li> I rub the bar into the brush, scrub my back for a few seconds, and that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> and I really do not like the bar.  </li>
            <li> I think you have to be careful with it around wash cloths and towels because I believe it takes the color out.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve never really had a problem with acne until now.</li>
            <li> I had the product in only a few days.</li>
            <li> Shipped and received as expected.</li>
            <li> A few months later the rash started to come back very slightly, but after a week of use it was gone again, and hasn&#x27;t returned since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For people with horrible acne (like me)it is really important to be consistent.  </li>
            <li> But it does dry your skin a little with overuse so be careful.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey, but it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this to people who are tired of zits encroaching on their self esteem.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin it may dry you out, but I have not experienced this.</li>
            <li> This was recommended, so I purchased it the other day.  </li>
            <li> IF too drying then use it every other day.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that the flawlessness of my skin was due to this alone.</li>
            <li> PanOxyl Bar doesn&#x27;t bleach your clothes or towels like other acne-type products do.  </li>
            <li> They probably should make a 5% bar and reevaluate some of the other ingredients.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first due to almost every acne product not working on my skin.</li>
            <li> This product works but I have to use it every other day on my face.</li>
            <li> Used it every day and had extremely oily skin</li>
            <li> Seems as though it made me break out more :(</li>
            <li> and I hope it will help other Consumers</li>
            <li> and I have extremely oily skin.</li>
            <li> And despite its drying effect, I have cut out any other products (including moisturizer) in hopes that it will allow Panoxyl to do its thing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if my current routine helps or if it just purged my skin</li>
            <li> This is a little on the high side, but it does have the max percentage of medicine you can buy OTC, and it really does control bad breakouts.  </li>
            <li> This is way too strong for the sensitive skin on your face and you will chaff and dry out horribly.</li>
            <li> So with this bar &amp; Aztec Secret Indian Healing Clay deep pore mask, she finally seems to be clearing up.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried OTC products including OXY and Stridex with no success.</li>
            <li> We could get the prescription stuff for less.  </li>
            <li> I bought it for less than $10 at Walgreens 6 days ago.</li>
            <li> it helps, I&#x27;m black and I have oily skin and tried everything except Accutane and chemical peels.  </li>
            <li> I found this at walmart for like six bucks (they are hidden on the bottom shelf).   </li>
            <li> I have been training for a half marathon and have been sweating profusely.</li>
            <li> I switched to the bar because per the reviews people seem to slightly prefer it.</li>
            <li> It is also unfortunate that what normally costs us $6 to $8 has become $25 to $60 online.</li>
            <li> From tiny red bumps to ones with white heads and itchy ones and painful to touch ones.</li>
            <li> I admit, I was a little concerned about how concentrated the formula is (10%)</li>
            <li> Perhaps my skin just disliked something in the bar.</li>
            <li> I started breaking out with tons of tiny bumps on my forehead, sides of face, neck, behind my ears and my chest.</li>
            <li> but now it&#x27;s not available.  </li>
            <li> worked well for me within a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I have acne on my back and shoulders, even worse when I was in college.</li>
            <li> I do as the box says and try to leave it sitting on the skin for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> i have use it like everyday it works..</li>
            <li> Ever benzoyl peroxide acne treatment I have tried outside of this has failed, I have tried all the strengths including extreme strengths.</li>
            <li> I decided to go to the dermatologist to see what he thought, and he barely listened to me and prescribed an antibiotic and expensive face cream.</li>
            <li> When used on arm it does reduce the bump down, and makes it a bit darker, but slowly fade.</li>
            <li> I have read that Benzoyl Peroxide products usually cause dryness and minor irritations to the skin, but I have never experienced anything like this.</li>
            <li> I have never experienced any dry or irritated skin from this either.</li>
            <li> Some people give up using this soap due to dryness, but you should just pay attention to your skin&#x27;s needs by cutting back to once a day or every other day and you should still use a moisturizer along with it and DRINK WATER!!!</li>
            <li> I usually purchase it at the drugstore I work at</li>
            <li> For me, I usually use the 10% during the warmer months of the year, and the 5% during dry/cold winter months because the PanOxl soap does have a drying</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t break out, but while living in FL</li>
            <li> Needless to say, this actually works!</li>
            <li> He seemed rude, and cocky.</li>
            <li> started using it this past week</li>
            <li> I struggled horribly with adult cystic acne and an old school dermatologist recommended PanOxyl.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used 10% in the past with other products and never had such a bad reaction.</li>
            <li> Dried out my skin and made my acne much worse than my usual 2% salicylic acid wash.  </li>
            <li> Nothing I got hardly ever worked after thay</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing I&#x27;ve been using it for at least 20 years.  </li>
            <li> At that point, I developed some acne on my face and awful acne on my back.</li>
            <li> If your on the edge just at least try it.</li>
            <li> it did at least work, and I saw and felt the results.  </li>
            <li> As stated above, it gave me crazy breakouts for about two months.  </li>
            <li> I have moderate acne and this dried out my skin so bad after 2 days of using it</li>
            <li> I suggest putting water on the soap, then soap slowly on your body.</li>
            <li> Refusing to pay such a ridiculous price even though I am desperate, I called the manufacturer, Steifel Laboratories.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re sick of spending money on OTC products, and are tired of using harsh smelling products, this is your next step.</li>
            <li> I use it every day, no dry skin or bad odor.</li>
            <li> some worked temporarily but were too expensive to maintain, and some failed instantly.</li>
            <li> I would seriously recommend this product if you&#x27;re having acne problems.</li>
            <li> the bar will last awhile if you use it during bad weeks.&lt;br /&gt;Fred</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t really bad, but enough to annoy me.  </li>
            <li> Worked well for me when other products haven&#x27;t,  I just stopped using because the bar would get dirty</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s very hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> For the past few months I&#x27;ve been having some really bad breakouts.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this product is no longer being made, at least until Sep 2011 according to the Steifel.com website.  </li>
            <li> I used it on my chest but it didn&#x27;t seem to work and made it worse</li>
            <li> This I was not happy with.</li>
            <li> My pimples are drying out (I had to stop putting around my eye, becuase of the thin skin and the bit of irritation)and</li>
            <li> I have used everything on these bumps over the years from drawing salve (black tar like dream that literally draws out the infection) to having to take antibiotics when they got bad.  </li>
            <li> When I was little, I suffered from bad acne and took Accutane.</li>
            <li> Im just surprised at the outrageous price.</li>
            <li> All the neutrogena and other brand&#x27;s acne body wash is crap.</li>
            <li> I have seen the ridiculous amount of money that people were asking for one, so don&#x27;t get desperate..</li>
            <li> Am I reading the quantity wrong?</li>
            <li> Maybe there was something wrong in my routine</li>
            <li> This caused a sweat rash on my chest, and it unfortunately lasted for months.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re wrong.</li>
            <li> We have used both the 5% and 10% BOTH are now very difficult to find, I stocked up when 5-6 bucks a bar.</li>
            <li> When It was impossible to find I substituted with Coral Actives, which I heard about in Amazon reviews and purchased on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> , for reasons that I cannot explain, my acne has never flared up so badly with a Benzoyl Peroxide medication.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had acne and bad breakouts, proactive, dermatologist prescriptions, etc.</li>
            <li> My face got really bad and had to discontinue.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t seem to bleach out my towels, linens, or clothes nearly as bad as the \\&quot;storebrand\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> However, when I checked the price I was shocked.</li>
            <li> so it has been a painful process.</li>
            <li> Ever since I gave it a try, I have not been disappointed.</li>
            <li> about 2-3 years ago I was extremely disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I hate giving bad reviews.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> And the Stieffel company has horrible customer service</li>
            <li> The one problem is is that it dries out your skin horribly.</li>
            <li> I was a preteen then and my acne was terrible!!!</li>
            <li> This is a nasty way of making money.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> price is outrageous and I wish Amazon would check for occasions like this.</li>
            <li> I had an awful break out.</li>
            <li> It smells terrible</li>
            <li> This soap burned my skin terribly</li>
            <li> The price of $46.00 is incorrect and is completely wrong!!!!  </li>
            <li> After having my worst break out in months I started going through reviews to troubleshoot about 2 weeks ago.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Excellent!!!!. Worked in 3 days....</li>
            <li> Since the PanOxyl bar has apparently been discontinued with no return in sight (they even removed the space on the shelf for it at my local Walgreens! And the Stieffel company has horrible customer service and I can&#x27;t get an answer out of them.) I&#x27;m wondering if anyone knows of any good alternatives? The PanOxyl cream washes just do NOT work as well for me for whatever reason. What has everyone else had luck with?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was thinking of trying the Derma Topix brand (http://www.amazon.com/Topix-Benzoyl-Peroxide-Wash-bottle/dp/B001MA7QFO/ref&#x3D;sr_1_3?s&#x3D;beauty&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1369405439&amp;sr&#x3D;1-3&amp;keywords&#x3D;panoxyl)--anyone ever tried this? How does it compare to PanOxyl?</li>
            <li> My husband has been using this product for years.  We have gotten it at Walmart and Meijer and it is $6 a bar.  They never have it anymore so I thought I would come on here to see if I could buy it. OMG $25 a bar?  I don&#x27;t think it works that good.  He goes through a bar in 2 weeks. We could get the prescription stuff for less.  Am I reading the quantity wrong?</li>
            <li> I purchased this item for butt acne, which is something that has happened as I have gotten older. They sent me the liquid version instead of the bar. I called them and they did respond promptly and agreed to send me the correct order. I did not have time to go through the return process, so I decided to try it. It is the same thing-just in the bottle version. I did see a decrease in my acne, but it did not all go away. However, it is the best thing that I have found thus far. I also exfoliate the area once or twice a week, which I would recommend.</li>
            <li> I picked up the PanOxyl 10% Bar when I couldn&#x27;t find the Foaming Wash at my local Wal-Mart which usually has the Foaming Wash of the same type, which I am still an enormous fan of, at a reasonable price. The bar was $4 cheaper as well so I figured hey, same thing but in a bar, why not right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, for reasons that I cannot explain, my acne has never flared up so badly with a Benzoyl Peroxide medication. I can&#x27;t remember the last time I had so many zits on my forehead and cheeks. The kind of zits that are stubborn too, they returned over and over again. I am under the impression that the medication&#x27;s tendency to dry the skin accelerated oil production. Even using a good lotion after application made no difference. Maybe there was something wrong in my routine I don&#x27;t know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taking a look at the ingredients the two are different. Not my much, but they are different. Perhaps my skin just disliked something in the bar. Either way, I cannot rate this product very highly for what it did to my face. I have since switched back to the PanOxyl Foaming Face Wash of the same grade and my skin has started clearing up again within a matter of a few days which makes me think something about the bar, whatever it was, just didn&#x27;t get along with my skin. I am sure this bar will work miracles for most, but those of you who have some more sensitive skin like mine, try the Face Wash instead, it works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a believer in over-the-counter medicines as your second line of defense, prescriptions as your third.  First is always what you eat and how you live... but no soapboxes here, just the soap itself.&lt;br /&gt;Benzoyl Peroxide is a near-miracle medicine, as it works for most acne sufferers without prescriptions.  The only time you need prescription meds that use this is when the delivery method is (somewhat) more effective at delivering more medicine at once or making it work longer by adding something to keep it from drying out too quickly.&lt;br /&gt;However, most of us just need a good soap for the morning, after work, and bedtime.  This is a little on the high side, but it does have the max percentage of medicine you can buy OTC, and it really does control bad breakouts.  I wouldn&#x27;t use it prophylactically, avoiding the risk of developing a tolerance for it, so the bar will last awhile if you use it during bad weeks.&lt;br /&gt;Fred</li>
            <li> I have used the 5% bar and have been impressed.  I have had a couple of cluster breakouts for several weeks and was not getting any results from anything I tried.  This was recommended, so I purchased it the other day.  I have only been using it at night and have been very impressed.  The breakout areas were immediately clearer (almost gone). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> Totally worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m fairly active and do a lot of physical activity. This caused a sweat rash on my chest, and it unfortunately lasted for months. Nothing would help it go away. I tried lotion, different soap and body wash, different detergent - no effect. I shower pretty often, but even showering immediately after exercise didn&#x27;t seem to help at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this for around 2 weeks and it was gone. As a bonus, it&#x27;s also helped clear my skin up really well. A few months later the rash started to come back very slightly, but after a week of use it was gone again, and hasn&#x27;t returned since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> This is marvelous for oily skin with juicy acne pimples. Be sure to use this ONLY at night for the first few days until you figure out how much it dries out your skin. I found using a facial complexion brush encourages one to really massage and cleanse the skin and pores for the recommended 2 minutes. OK I admit I used to be a splish-splash kind of face washer until a friend reminded me how long doctors take washing their hands to get rid of germs/bacteria OR how long you&#x27;re supposed to brush your teeth. IF it doesn&#x27;t dry you out too much you can use it twice a day. IF too drying then use it every other day. My athletic teenager&#x27;s back-ne has responded better to this than liquid Benzoyl Peroxide washes, gels, ointments. Be sure to use sunscreen while using this product to protect your new, sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My family has used PanOxyl Acne Cleansing Bar off and on for years on Pharmacist&#x27;s recommendation BEFORE Benzoyl Peroxide was deemed the acne cure-all in nearly ALL acne preparations. We have used both the 5% and 10% BOTH are now very difficult to find, I stocked up when 5-6 bucks a bar. I can remember paying less than 2 bucks a bar at local drug stores when it still was in the red, white and blue box. When I called Stieffel about the scarcity they mentioned difficulties with their factory in Mexico where it&#x27;s made.</li>
            <li> $44.00 for this are you kidding me?! I can get it in Shopko or Walgreens for $7. Granted their distribution center is out of stock right now but I&#x27;d never pay $40 for this.</li>
            <li> This product works great!  Especially with the Acne.org BP (2.5% lotion).   I showered with it once or twice a day and it really works for me, if I get some dryness, I use the moisturizer from Acne,org with it.  Unfortunately, this product is no longer being made, at least until Sep 2011 according to the Steifel.com website.  They recommend the Panoxyl 10 foam which works great also, in fact it&#x27;s just like this product except a foam, only problem is it costs much more and runs out really fast!  I hope their factory starts up again soon.</li>
            <li> I have read that Benzoyl Peroxide products usually cause dryness and minor irritations to the skin, but I have never experienced anything like this. But, I have to mention that I have oily skin. The skin feels great after the bath and it smells very fresh too (little hint of peroxide). I have never had severe acne problems, i have few blemishes on my back I would like to get rid off and sometimes I have breakouts on the face. My back has already cleared very  well. Overall I am very satisfied. I will order again.</li>
            <li> WARNING: DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT FOR $40+ DOLLARS.  This product is perhaps the greatest I ever used on my chest and back.  It completely cleared up my acne on those parts of my body and kept it clear.  So, as you can imagine, I was pretty upset when I heard it was discontinued.  I never found anything quite like it.  Today, I went to Walgreens and happened to stumble into the face/body wash (essentially acne) area, and saw a tag for this bar!  I was so happy!  I asked the clerk if it was being back into production and she said yes!  If it&#x27;s not in your local store yet, it should be by the end of this week (September 17, 2011)!  Don&#x27;t pay $40+ for it, it&#x27;s coming BACK IN STOCK for around $8.50!</li>
            <li> This bar works really well. My pimples are going away/getting much much smaller. The one problem is is that it dries out your skin horribly. It&#x27;s worth it though because of the results! I use the bar at night, then in the morning put lotion on my face.I&#x27;m seeing amazing differences!</li>
            <li> I think this product is amazing. I bought it when I started running because I was getting some pimples on my back from sweating. I started using it on my face as well. I had no idea how much clearer my face could be! My skin feels soft and smooth and I just love it! I have never been this impressed with any product EVER! It is a bit drying, but just get some good lotion and you will be fine. Definitely do need to use on a regular basis though, at least every-other day. I definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> This is a great soap and it works well on acne. But the vendor charges the case price for a single bar. The vendor appears to be taking advantage of a shortage.</li>
            <li> While the product is very good the cost of one bar was ridiculous, so I sent it back to buy it locally!</li>
            <li> WOW! This stuff works! And FAST!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a 27 year old female. When I was little, I suffered from bad acne and took Accutane. It cleared my skin, and haven&#x27;t had problems again until about 2 months ago. I started breaking out with tons of tiny bumps on my forehead, sides of face, neck, behind my ears and my chest. My skin was really oily. I stopped using certain hair products and makeup to see if that was causing it, but the bumps stayed and got worse no matter what I tried. I decided to go to the dermatologist to see what he thought, and he barely listened to me and prescribed an antibiotic and expensive face cream. I really didn&#x27;t want to take an antibiotic so I researched online and came across this bar of soap. I bought it for less than $10 at Walgreens 6 days ago. I have been washing my face, neck and chest once a day. After the first two nights, I noticed that the bumps on my chest where gone. By day 6 (today), my face and neck are incredibly smoother with only a few bumps remaining (which you can barely see). I can&#x27;t believe how well and fast this soap worked! It&#x27;s incredible! I haven&#x27;t experienced any over drying of my skin either. I know it hasn&#x27;t even been a week since I started this product so if anything changes I will come back and update my review, but so far this stuff is WONDERFUL!!! Give it a try!</li>
            <li> Folks - you can get the same product at Walmart for $4.82 (Equate 4 oz bar with same 10% Benzoyl Peroxide at Walmart)! The ad gave the impression that you would receive 12 bars of soap for the price!  When I got ONE - I could not believe it!  Who would pay $80.00 for an $8 bar of soap?  Not me!</li>
            <li> I think it only dries out the facial skin. Also, you only use it once a day so it&#x27;s not so overdrying.. I mean this is powerful stuff. Proactiv has like 2.5% benzoyl peroxide i believe? This stuff more than quadruples that... i can use this on my body as much as iwant though and it doesn&#x27;t overdry it, it just clears everything up, i love this stuff! First got it by PRESCRIPTION from a dermatologist. So its good stuff.</li>
            <li> If you have problems with acne scars and acne in general. This is an awesome little bar. But it does dry your skin a little with overuse so be careful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years and absolutely love it.  I usually purchase it at the drugstore I work at but now it&#x27;s not available.  I was astounded to see the Amazon price of $60 when I paid $3-4 for the last 10 years!!!!</li>
            <li> worked well for me within a few weeks. decent product, will use it again. Compared well to a more expensive product I tried.</li>
            <li> I was initially prescribed this by my dermatologist at the VA. When I asked to have it refilled, I was told they no longer offered it and she thinks it had something to do with the manufacturer possibly no longer making it. I just happened to check online and there seems to be no shortage. I bought several (just in case). This soap is great and I use it daily on my face. It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out and it is very effective.</li>
            <li> I know some people don&#x27;t like knock offs and some don&#x27;t support Wal Mart. I left the store with Equate&#x27;s version of this bar of soap for about 5 bucks. Just a thought...</li>
            <li> Starts to have an effect after 7-10 days. You have to endure things getting worse before they get better plus drys you out and dyes fabrics. You can alleviate some of these problems by using it once a day and alternating with a moisturising neutral soap like dove. I don&#x27;t recommend leaving in on for any more than a minute before washing it off. Any longer and you will dry yourself to the point of redness. I recommend 20-30 seconds. I have severe cystic acne and it did work on my back and chest but then I had a recurrence and I thought here we go again but if you use a small amount of retinol cream at a weak percentage in conjunction with a moisturising soap and the panoxyl I seem to have found a consistent routine that actually works. Moderate or light spots I think would would be easily handled by thus but I would be hesitant to use it on the face because it is drying and makes you very sun sensitive.</li>
            <li> Used it twice in three days &amp; my skin was completely fried. Took a few weeks for my skin to peel &amp; return to its normal condition. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend to anyone unless they have very, very strong skin.</li>
            <li> After reading all the reports that this product was discontinued I decided to go to the source and find out for sure.  They said they are shipping out the Panoxyl Bar later this month and it should be in stores by mid October!  I am so glad because I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> It made my face and décolleté really dry and provoked pimples. I didn&#x27;t have much of a problem with pimples before and only bought the soap to make the skin a bit smoother. The skin around the corners of my mouth got really really dry and started peeling (it&#x27;s very red) - that&#x27;s very visible and the problem is still there although I only used the bar like 4 times on the face and haven&#x27;t used it for 3 days anymore. I guess it worked a bit on the back. Anyway, I won&#x27;t use it anymore and would think twice if I were you.</li>
            <li> I got this recommendation from my dermatologist. I have acne on my back and shoulders, even worse when I was in college. He recommended that I use this. He also specifically told me NOT to use it on my face, as you could gather from many of these reviews. I was also on an oral antibiotic at the time, so I can&#x27;t say that the flawlessness of my skin was due to this alone. I don&#x27;t take the antibiotic anymore and I am going to try using this again now that my problem is much more mild than it was back then. All the neutrogena and other brand&#x27;s acne body wash is crap. This was good. WARNING: rinse thoroughly and use a white towel. This stuff WILL bleach out your towels, bedsheets, etc.</li>
            <li> I got this after I started noticing breakouts on my shoulders and also some on my face. My roommate had luck with it, so I figured why not. This is by far the best thing I&#x27;ve used to treat breakouts and my shoulders and face are all cleared up after only two days. My skin on my shoulders never dried out but using it on my face with other medications made it a little dry, so I put some aloe on to moisturize and also help clear up the acne.</li>
            <li> Love this for using once a week on my body. If you use it more than that, it&#x27;ll dry your skin out. I don&#x27;t use it on my face but it does an awesome job and keeping away pimples on my back or chest.</li>
            <li> gave my skin a rash, this is supposed to cure acne or to give you more acne? I do not recommend this product at all..</li>
            <li> I am in early 30s, and have always struggled with acne breakouts since my teens.  Recently I had been having major stress breakouts on my cheaks, forehead and chin and was recommended this soap along with Clindamycin topical medication. My acne is clearing up and now I only use the PanOxyl bar along with my alcohol-free toner and Neutragena moisturizer to help with dryness. If I get too dry sometimes due to weather changes or washing my face too much, I switch to my Cetaphil gentle cleanser. Some people give up using this soap due to dryness, but you should just pay attention to your skin&#x27;s needs by cutting back to once a day or every other day and you should still use a moisturizer along with it and DRINK WATER!!! And dry your face with a white towel or you will have bleach spots all over your pretty new colorful towels, like me. The people that say it does not bleach their stuff must have only white linens or are excellent at making sure they leave no residue behind.</li>
            <li> My son&#x27;s dermatologist recommended for my 13 year old.  He said I should be able to find locally.  Could not. Ordered and received within a couple of days.  Significant improvement on my son&#x27;s back acne. He uses in shower and keeps on for a couple of minutes before rinsing. Would recommend but caution can cause a little dryness if left on skin too long.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed.  I have had Acne for over a decade and tried every product.  This is the best working product, I use it to wash shoulders, neck, back, face twice a day and I am the clearest I have been.</li>
            <li> I was prescribed this soap about 12 yrs ago by my dermatologist in Jamaica. I was a preteen then and my acne was terrible!!! On my face, only my eye socket section had no acne. I had every type of acne present. I was prescribed this soap, along with tablets, a special shampoo and a cream. In less than 2 months, I was perfectly cleared up. Everything else finished and I was just using the soap. I remained perfectly clear until the soap finished. Spots started popping up all over again, went back to get the soap and heard it was discontinued.  Nothing I got hardly ever worked after thay, then voila! I found the soap on here. Now I&#x27;m happy and my skin is much better now.&lt;br /&gt;If it helps, I&#x27;m black and I have oily skin and tried everything except Accutane and chemical peels.  I have been fighting acne since I was 9. Now, 16 yrs later, the fight is easier to win thanks to this soap.&lt;br /&gt;Warning: It&#x27;s drying, but I don&#x27;t mind it. It aided in calming my oily skin alot. Love it!</li>
            <li> Loved it, noticed a difference after the first use. Will re-order.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with this product.  I have always used the PanOxyl Bar 5% and it just wasn&#x27;t doing the job.  The 10% strength made all of the difference.  It has seemed to dry out my complexion without being too damaging.  PanOxyl Bar doesn&#x27;t bleach your clothes or towels like other acne-type products do.  It does such a thorough job.  BIG recommendation from me!</li>
            <li> PanOxl bar used to be available locally, but my drug store stopped carrying it.  So I am very glad I found it on amazon.  There are two varieties a 5% and a 10%.  For me, I usually use the 10% during the warmer months of the year, and the 5% during dry/cold winter months because the PanOxl soap does have a drying effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product works better for me than any other acne/face soap that I have ever used. It lathers well, apply to face, and rinse clean. The medication in the soap is great at clearing up blemishes, and better yet, prevents break-outs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tend to have oily skin on my face, but using PanOxl soap in the morning and at night prevents my face from becoming shiney.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap comes in a little plastic soap dish with a clear lid, so it is clean and self-contained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this soap to anyone who has oily skin or acne breakouts. If you tend to have dry skin on your face, you may want to try the 5% first.  I have used it for years. Glad to see that it is carried on amazon.</li>
            <li> I struggled horribly with adult cystic acne and an old school dermatologist recommended PanOxyl.  The soap keeps the acne at bay, it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, but most impressively:  a bar lasts forever. Forever as in I use it once a day and a bar lasts a year. I&#x27;m guessing I&#x27;ve been using it for at least 20 years.  It&#x27;s a shame the bar has come off the market.  When It was impossible to find I substituted with Coral Actives, which I heard about in Amazon reviews and purchased on Amazon.  It&#x27;s a great substitute, but I highly recommend the PanOxyl bar.</li>
            <li> Very good product, lasts longer than gel or other products for acnea.  Heard it&#x27;s discontinued for some time, hope it will return soon</li>
            <li> I have a medical condition that causes me to be more prone to acne than the average adult and this product really does work! I bought mine at Walgreens, but I&#x27;m a regular customer on Amazon and wanted to give this an updated review. I read the reviews on this product on Walgreens&#x27; website, but even on that website it had almost full stars. I have fair skin and it&#x27;s rather sensitive so I started off only using this product once a day followed by a really good FACIAL moisturizer and within the first week, I noticed a HUGE improvement! I only use this product maybe once every two weeks now and I&#x27;ve noticed I rarely even get any zits at all. I was even able to change from a coverup foundation to just a tinted moisturizer with vitamins in it! It can dry your face out, it started to dry mine out so I started to wash my face with it once every three days to where now, I don&#x27;t even really need it! Best product for acne for the price- and I should know, I have everything from clean &amp; clear to neutrogena in my bathroom but this product beats all of them by far and it was priced at around $8.</li>
            <li> So I am horrified to say I have skin that is not just sensitive, but likes to get big bumps (particularly on my underarms) has been going on for years. Nothing I have tried has worked like this, the closest thing I was doing was literally using my biore face wash (which I LOVE fyi for my face) on my underarms, but I was still getting these bumps. I found this at walmart for like six bucks (they are hidden on the bottom shelf).   I have been using for 8 days (once a day) on my under arms (not using it on my face, dont really need it) and other sensitive places prone to acne. I am so proud to say two days in I was getting relief! Plus it hasn&#x27;t bothered my sensitive skin! I have used everything on these bumps over the years from drawing salve (black tar like dream that literally draws out the infection) to having to take antibiotics when they got bad.  I do as the box says and try to leave it sitting on the skin for a few minutes. So far I am over whelmed with relief and joy, I wont be embarrassed to wear sleeveless shirts this summer!!  As a side note I also use seabreeze (well the knock off brand) on my skin as well to help stop any bumps from forming. If all I have to do is use this soap and sea breeze I will be happy. In a week I have used a fair amount of the bar, but I figure maybe a bar every month to month and half.</li>
            <li> I have tried the 5% and the 10% version of this bar and I would say that it is pretty effective to a degree.  The most I can use this bar is once a day every other day in the colder months and once a day every day in warmer months.  I would describe my skin as sensitive but it is not extremely sensitive like some folks I know.  I have to make sure that I rinse very well so it doesn&#x27;t bleach my sheets or clothes and follow up with a good moisturizer, depending on the weather.</li>
            <li> the panoxyl bar worked wonderfully at keeping my acne from coming back, and making my skin smooth. would buy again.</li>
            <li> I am in my 40s. I didn&#x27;t develop acne until after 35. At that point, I developed some acne on my face and awful acne on my back. My doctor told me it was hormonal and suggested I try this with a boar&#x27;s bristle back brush. At first, it actually got worse so I almost gave up. However, I think it was just working its way out of my system. Now I have been acne free for almost a year. I rub the bar into the brush, scrub my back for a few seconds, and that&#x27;s it. I have never had problems with it fading anything like Proactive does and I find it works so much better than Proactive.</li>
            <li> Just trying to save people money you can go buy this same bar of soap from a pharmacy for about $10.00</li>
            <li> This is a nasty way of making money.&lt;br /&gt;For a while (and for some mysterious reasons no one knows) this product was off the shelves.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s back on the market and our local stores sell it for a varying prices between $6 to $8.&lt;br /&gt;Please save your money and check which one of your local stores carry this item.&lt;br /&gt;This price is outrageous and I wish Amazon would check for occasions like this.</li>
            <li> This soap was much too strong for my skin and I really DON&#x27;T have sensitive skin. It left my face and chest all red and puffy. I&#x27;ve used 10% in the past with other products and never had such a bad reaction. They probably should make a 5% bar and reevaluate some of the other ingredients.</li>
            <li> i have been suffering from spots on my face (mainly cheeks and chin) for 3 years now and i have not once had a clear face. so i thought i would try panoxyle 10% cream which i bought over the counter at asda chemist (under £4) and it has work great so far and have only been using it for 3 weeks now. only down side is you get dry skin and a bit redness so just try and only put it on the affected areas. and if you do get a lot of redness try and not put it on for couple of days until red calms down. Also a tip is to put it only on once a day but at night before bed, especially if you put makeup on during the day. so really happy so far with this as am finally starting to see a spot clear face.</li>
            <li> I ordered this to try it on my acne, it was ok, made my skin peel from dryness but still remained oily and had pimples... just didn&#x27;t make sense.</li>
            <li> This is literally the best acne medicine I have ever used. I have tried over a 100 different products (including ProActiv) throughout my acne stage and into my adulthood dealing with occasional acne flare ups. Nothing has worked as efficiently as this has for me. If you have tried other products with Benzoyl Peroxide in it and don&#x27;t think it will be any different you&#x27;re wrong. Ever benzoyl peroxide acne treatment I have tried outside of this has failed, I have tried all the strengths including extreme strengths. I tell all my friends about this who have acne problems, it is literally the best. I use this as a daily facial wash (in the shower) and get my shoulders and back as well, then finish up my wash with actual body wash. It works well if you apply it when you put your shampoo on and by the time you get done with your conditioner its thoroughly soaked. If you&#x27;re just starting it you want to not leave it on as long. I have never experienced any dry or irritated skin from this either. If you have a beard, it will make your hair lighter on your beard lighter as you continue using it. This stuff is so sought after that there was a shortage last year for it and people were successfully selling bars for 100+. I always buy multiples of this bar to make sure I have some to use as a couple days without this you will notice some flare ups appearing. I had been using it for a couple years straight with no acne flair ups at all and had a week where I lapsed in having any and I started breaking out, which I was completely unused to by this time. I would also make sure to use the bar as that has seemed to have the best results. My girlfriend had a rogue pimple pop up and we washed it down with this, and before going to bed just got my finger wet and rubbed the bar lightly to get a little lather on the bar, applied it to her face and literally any trace of it was gone the next morning. Just be sure to wash it completely off your face once your done, thats the only way that youmight experience irritation and if you use a towel to dry off or wearing clothes when you wash your face and don&#x27;t wash it off completely you have a chance of semi-bleaching the towel or clothes.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to PanOxyl bar by a close, trusting friend. I was skeptical at first due to almost every acne product not working on my skin. Ever since I gave it a try, I have not been disappointed. It helps my breakouts and dries the zits by the second day of using it. I swear by PanOxyl and will continue to use it as long as it is available. However, it does dry out my face - with a little help from a facial moisturizer, I am good to go.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had acne and bad breakouts, proactive, dermatologist prescriptions, etc. wouldn&#x27;t work. My friend told me about panoxyl. I bought one bar from the store and in 3 days my skin was clear and stayed clear the whole time. When I ran out I found out it was discontinued in the stores. Glad I found it on amazon, once again I&#x27;m breakout free....</li>
            <li> Great product that i have used for nearly 30 years to keep face free of oil.  Works very well but is hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> This product changed my life.  I used to be ugly and pimply now I am fresh and fly. Thank you PanOxyl Bar 10% 4 oz!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been dealing for years with back acne...antibiotics, all the prescription creams and everything out there.  Using this daily on just my back keeps it pretty clear.  It is not spotless and I&#x27;m still prone every now and then but this has been such a wonderful product to really, really keep it under control.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell if this soap is working or not yet, but it has bleached my dark blue washcloths to be completely white in some spots which makes me nervous to use on my skin.  If its bleaching my towels that severely, what is it doing to my skin?</li>
            <li> i have use it like everyday it works..i have no burns yet! lol. i only use it once a day so do not OD on this product! good luck</li>
            <li> Been using this for years.  Its so good, its hard for the local stores to keep in stock so buying it on line assures a continuous supply.</li>
            <li> This product works but I have to use it every other day on my face. I use it twice a day on my neck, arms, and chest twice a day in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed it smells. It&#x27;s not something people around you will notice but I can smell the BP when I&#x27;m in bed sleeping. I use spray some cologne on me and problem solved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use a moisturizer as well as this will dry the hell out of your skin without it.</li>
            <li> Really helped clear up my skin!!&lt;br /&gt;Did dry up my skin a bit though but really helped with my body acne.&lt;br /&gt;I wonder if this comes in a bottle format because that would be preferred.</li>
            <li> Works well for keratosis piloris. Although, I have to use ammonium lactate 12%, after the body wash. Seems I will always have this skin condition, so, I have to buy ahead.</li>
            <li> Worked well for me when other products haven&#x27;t,  I just stopped using because the bar would get dirty and I really do not like the bar.  I may try the liquid.</li>
            <li> I wish more stores carried this product.  I couldn&#x27;t be without it,  I have oily skin so I leave it on mr face for about a minute.</li>
            <li> I am so happy this is available again. I tried some other benzoyl peroxide soaps, but this is by far the best. It keeps my skin clear and doesn&#x27;t dry my very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> When I turned 25 I got \\&quot;Adult Cystic Acne\\&quot; on my back, arms, &amp; chest area. I had been prescribed to multiple different products by my dermatologist some worked temporarily but were too expensive to maintain, and some failed instantly. I found this bar mentioned on an acne forum and decided to give it a try. 1 word- AMAZING!  My body acne cleared up almost instantly! I couldn&#x27;t believe it was so simple! I would HIGHLY recommend this product to anyone suffering from body acne.   A side note: DO NOT use on your face. This is way too strong for the sensitive skin on your face and you will chaff and dry out horribly. Body use only.   Love this product!</li>
            <li> I have been training for a half marathon and have been sweating profusely. I have long hair as well, so as a result I have been breaking out on my back. I have used this once a day and have only seen a slight improvement. I will try to use it twice a day to see if my back acne will improve. Note that this soap does over dry the skin, so be sure to use a moisturizer after use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve honestly used this product for my facial acne since my dermatologist gave me a prescription for it for about 30 years ago. Used it every day and had extremely oily skin and I think it has even cured that.  When I was told they discontinued it about 2-3 years ago I was extremely disappointed.  I searched everywhere.  Finally found some at Walgreens and Eckerd and purchased every one they had.  I have used it literally since prescribed by prescription for about 30 years. Never a better product and have attempted others when originally discontinued and NO COMPARISON.  Glad its back. Great product!!!</li>
            <li> I use it every day, no dry skin or bad odor. I still get minor break outs, but a Great Help!</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t break out, but while living in FL I had an awful break out. My sister told me about this soap. I used it and it worked really well, it really dries your skin out so just use it on the infected areas</li>
            <li> I hate giving bad reviews. But I experienced contact dermatitis from this soap. I thought my face was purging, but it didn&#x27;t look like normal acne. My face got really bad and had to discontinue.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my sister who suffers from acne on her face and body at 26 and her skin looks great but you must have a great moisturiser as it dries you out a little.</li>
            <li> I bought this at wal-mart while i was out after reading many reviews on it and it really has made an improvement, i also think that for me its great because now that i have turned 20 my skin has become rather oily and this really helps balance my skin! I love it so far!</li>
            <li> Just need to make sure you use white towels.</li>
            <li> I have been using the panoxyl bar for five years now and nothing can even compare. I have tried many different acne cleansers for both my face and back and ethier it would make my face even oilier or would be red and itchy and still have acne. Well, I went to the dermatologist and they recommended this product so i tried it out. the first week or so i do admit your face does bring up a few pimples and impurities, but it gets soooo much better right after!! If your on the edge just at least try it. You wont regret it. I trust no other product than panoxyl. TRY IT!</li>
            <li> This product has NOT been discontinued and should be available in stores near the end of October.  Product fell in short supply (temporarily) due to ingredient shortages.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over 10 years and it is the only thing that works for me. So after seeing it no longer on the shelves at Walgreens, CVS, Osco, etc., I panicked and came online. After finding all online retailers having the same issue, I saw this on Amazon. Refusing to pay such a ridiculous price even though I am desperate, I called the manufacturer, Steifel Laboratories. Per the customer service rep, they experienced raw material shortages from their supplier, however, the problem has since been resolved with new shipments expect to go out to stores on 10/8. Hopefully this is true and the product will be back on my drug store shelves soon!</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d think that at some point in my 33 years that acne would cease to be a real problem.  Untreated, not a chance, but PanOxyl really really helps.  I used to use the \\&quot;leading brands\\&quot; and prescription meds for control.  PanOxyl works every bit as well as my prescription cleansers (at a sixth of the cost) and a hundred times better than the other stuff.  I use it morning, afterwork, and before bed and it doesn&#x27;t seem to bleach out my towels, linens, or clothes nearly as bad as the \\&quot;storebrand\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> The products that take 3 steps of washing and applying different liquids take an extremely long time and it&#x27;s easy to skip a day or two.  When that happens, those little red monsters start invading your facial space again.  What is so great about the bar is that it is really EASY to use it every day.  For people with horrible acne (like me)it is really important to be consistent.  Just washing the face with it a couple minutes in the shower does wonders.  Highly recommend this to people who are tired of zits encroaching on their self esteem.</li>
            <li> this was hard to find for a while so the price was a bit high since this can be bought on the shelf (when available) for $6</li>
            <li> This may be to strong for my skin. I used it on my chest but it didn&#x27;t seem to work and made it worse</li>
            <li> This is by far the best product I have found to control my acne. It can be drying and I have to use an oil free lotion, but my skin looks so much better when I use this. It is as pure as acne medications can be without fragrance or other additives so doesn&#x27;t solve one problem and create another one for my allergy-sensistive skin.</li>
            <li> The cost will inhibit further use of this product. I had hoped for a bigger size bar at those prices.</li>
            <li> Nothing short of amazing, but I already knew that before purchasing from Amazon as I am a frequent user of the soap :)</li>
            <li> I had to come here and order this after searching for 2 years to clear my skin up. Needless to say, this actually works! I was just about to give up hope and go get pills to try to fix my skin, but this soap saved me. It takes a few weeks for you to really see results but it is worth using once a day. I was using twice a day but my skin started getting tight and dry, so one application seems to work just fine. If you want to clear your skin up, order this. No matter how much it is, buy it. You will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product, it is very drying but it is the only thing that clears my skin.  BUT I looked at this price here on Amazon and couldn&#x27;t believe it!!  I get it from Walmart (same size bar, package looks just a little different but it is the same exact product) for about $8.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  Keeps my skin clear.  I was amazed to see the prices here on Amazon today.  I did some research and found some in stock at MedShop Express (Qty: 93 to be exact).  I ordered 4 bars.  I will update again once I receive my shipment.  I have read some sketchy reviews on this company.  I guess we will see.  They sell them for $6.09 a bar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-J&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
            <li> It works very well and can be a bit drying. I found not as good on my face as other areas as the extra drying really really hurts on my face. Other than that it works great for all the other areas I needed.</li>
            <li> The PanOxyl Bar 10% - 4 oz - 1 Bar is good and effective for its intended use but too expensive.</li>
            <li> I love this bar. I wish they would step up production as it is always out of stock. this is the only product that is gentle yet effective on body acne. Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Not the most effective bar. I think Benzoyl Peroxide is great as a topical cream that you let sit on your face all night. It&#x27;ll kill bacteria and clear you up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a soap, it doesn&#x27;t sit long enough to kill much more bacteria than regular soap; however, all that 10% BP dripping down your face will bleach your towels, carpet, and clothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My personal recommendation is to keep a daily regime:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.) Salisylic Acid face soap (Can be bought anywhere that face soaps are sold)&lt;br /&gt;2.) BP cream @ night and a retinoid if you can afford it or have insurance. Like Differin.&lt;br /&gt;3.) Always soak razors in alcohol for 10 minutes before you shave.&lt;br /&gt;4.) Wash your pillow cases regularly.</li>
            <li> This is amazing!!! Works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> Works best on body acne, but if you have oily skin, beware! Strong chemicals like this only make my face produce more oil and eventually breaks out more than before. But my chest and back aren&#x27;t as oily as my face, so I can afford to use it in those places. And actually, an AHA moisturizing lotion seems to counteract the oil too, just as a by-the-way tip for those who have oily skin like me. It killed my body acne better than this and it makes me super smoooooth :-). If I do happen to use this on my face though, a mild, low percentage AHA moisturizer (right after a shower and just before the oil gets to pumping like crazy) helps me avoid mass amounts of oil. I make my own DIY AHA moisturizer with rose water, pure AHA, and sweet almond oil. There are recipes for DIY AHA online if anyone wanted to know.</li>
            <li> I have used this soap for my facial acnes, and it works well. It has made my skin bright and shinny, and prevented forming new acnes.</li>
            <li> This is the best cleanser for my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this bar in 07 after a pregnancy and it helped.  But I eventually went through an accutane treatment in 2010.  My skin pretty much stayed cleared but recently, I had to switch birth control pills which made me have some minor breakouts.  It wasn&#x27;t really bad, but enough to annoy me.  Pimples started popping up, a new one every other day.  My mom suggested seeing my dermatologist. But really, who feels like forking up 40 bucks on the copayment to get an anti-biotic and cream that takes so long to kick in.  So, I went to Walmart and saw on that bottom shelf that they had one PanOxl Bar left for 8 bucks.  I&#x27;ve been able to find this at CVS and Walgreens as well.  After using it twice a day for the last three days, the minor breakouts have disappeared and the blemishes are fading.  My skin looks absolutely amazing, I just had to write a review. I highly recommend this product and definitely make sure that you wear a moisturizer/sunscreen.  I recommend using this first before heading to your dermatologist which more than likely, he/she will put you on something that contains benzyl peroxide before boosting it up to something else.</li>
            <li> Love this product for my back but probably not for my nose. It smells terrible but i can endure it for a nice, soft back without acne.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! And very fast time! I will do business with them again and I will tell others about their product.</li>
            <li> works great on my daughter&#x27;s black heads along with her prescription medication.</li>
            <li> Seems as though it made me break out more :(</li>
            <li> This is my first Review on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I am taking the time to write this Review,because I DO NOT want to see another Consumer get RIPPED OFF !!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Review is my Opinion and I hope it will help other Consumers should they want to purchase the Panoxyl Acne Cleansing line of products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Price being offered by various Independent Vendors on the Amazon site is HIGH WAY ROBBERY !!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PanOxyl Bar 10% - 4 oz for $47.95&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PanOxyl Maxium Strength Acne Cleansing Bar, 4-Ounce Bar (Pack of 3) for $149.97&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pack 4 Panoxyl Acne Cleansing Soap Bar 10% Benzoyl Peroxide 4oz for $375.00&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY this Product line from the Vendors selling it on the Amazon site. BEWARE !!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can purchase the SAME EXACT Product line at WALMART, CVS, Walgreen&#x27;s, and Rite-Aid.&lt;br /&gt;The price for one PanOxyl Bar 10% - 4 oz  ranges  between $6 - $10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I DO GIVE the Product line a 5 STAR rating.</li>
            <li> I use it for the intended purpose of controlling acne. Overall I think it does a good job of cleaning and removing dirt and oil. However I don&#x27;t find that it leaves my skin 100% blemish free. I would say it helps, but it is not a total cure. I think you have to be careful with it around wash cloths and towels because I believe it takes the color out. In conclusion, I like the product but it&#x27;s very hard to find in stores. I would recommend the product.</li>
            <li> If you have consistently dry skin, I would not recommend this as it will dry your skin out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for me, I have very oily skin, and drying my skin out is definitely a plus!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To get the most benefit out of it, use this with an exfoliating rag or pad and let the soap absorb into your skin for at least a minute before rinsing off.</li>
            <li> I thought I was paying 1/10 the price when I bought this, because of that old memory, and because of that, I found their customer service to be efficient, helpful, and courteous. And I didn&#x27;t make a return; I need this stuff.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s excellent.  good shipping.</li>
            <li> UPDATE: I liked the product so much I wanted to purchase more PanOxyl. However, when I checked the price I was shocked. On June 2, 2012 I bought PanOxyl for $8. Now it&#x27;s $20?? I contacted the seller about the increase about the price. I stated that I found PanOxyl at Costco/BJs for $7, and asked Armando (the seller) if he could match the price. He said \\&quot;No, but thanks for the heads up.\\&quot; He seemed rude, and cocky. Not buying from this seller ever again. Edited my review from 4 stars to 2 for the rudeness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 22 years old, and I&#x27;ve never really had a problem with acne until now. I&#x27;ve tried OTC products including OXY and Stridex with no success. Perhaps it was the kind of makeup I was using, or the change in the weather, or the fact that since I&#x27;m getting older, my body chemistry is changing. Either way, I was having a problem (massive red bumps, regular pimples, white heads, etc.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I browsed through Amazon looking for something. I came across PanOxyl and thought I&#x27;d give it a try. I admit, I was a little concerned about how concentrated the formula is (10%) but I figured \\&quot;Why not?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read the reviews to make sure I knew what I was getting myself into.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes it can dry out your skin, depending on your skin type. I have oily skin--using this twice a day for several days I noticed patches of skin were rough. I simply cut down how often I used the soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes it will bleach your towels. This I was not happy with. However, I dye my towels so it&#x27;s more of a hassle. In the future I would have a towel designated for the use of this soap (this isn&#x27;t a problem if you use it in the shower, just if you wash your face at the sink.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this stuff works. And it lasts quite a long time since it is in bar form. If you&#x27;re sick of spending money on OTC products, and are tired of using harsh smelling products, this is your next step. I would seriously recommend this product if you&#x27;re having acne problems. It&#x27;s only $8, and it&#x27;s in bar form so it will last quite a while.</li>
            <li> This soap works great, it was recommended by my dermatologist.  Have used it for years as a shampoo 3 0r 4 times a week.  will turn hair gray eventually.</li>
            <li> I used PanOxyl years ago and it did cause some skin flaking, and I stopped using it, I only used the bar soap at the time.  I just recently started looking for it again&lt;br /&gt;but it did at least work, and I saw and felt the results.  So after recently checking every store (Walgreens, Walmart, CVS, RiteAid, Dollar General, etc.) I have come to the conclusion they are no longer selling the item.  So I was on the hunt for something that had a comparable amount of Benzoyl Peroxide and I came across ClearZit.&lt;br /&gt;I started using it this past week and I have extremely oily skin. At first I didn&#x27;t notice any changes, and it was causing any flaking and it didn&#x27;t really feel like a medication, but today, in my 4th or 5th day of using it, it has broken through my oily skin and I see that it is FINALLY working for me.  I have used so many products and this is a trial period for this one, because I had initially bough Ambi to fade my hyperpigmentation from the acne scars that I have on my face.  This seems to be doing the trick.  I also have been using Witch Hazel as an astringent/toner for my face and using Aveeno facial cleansing pads with Salicylc Acid to wash my face.  So far so good.  My pimples are drying out (I had to stop putting around my eye, becuase of the thin skin and the bit of irritation)and my acne scars seem to be lightening up. I also use a sunscreen moisturizer from Aveeno with 30 SPF during the day.  I will probably follow it all up this weekend with some Shea Butter I found at my local Beauty Supply to moisturize my face overnight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully this helps....someone.</li>
            <li> great for removing excess body acne. it slooowwwly gets ri of the black marks from the blackheads but not fast enough for.me.  i bought it for ly 15 year old son and he.actually uses it.</li>
            <li> Very very Upset. Ordered for My Daughter And Soap Was Expired Several yrs Ago. Box completely Worn Out. Never Will trust Them Again. You Don&#x27;t Treat People Like That.</li>
            <li> This bar soap worked great for me.  I continue to use it twice a day and it works well to keep my acne under control.  The service I received from Amazon was wonderful as well. I had the product in only a few days.</li>
            <li> good product, but too expensive. not to knock the product, but the people selling these items are charging way to much.</li>
            <li> I love this product, everytime i have a breakout moment i use it and it clears my face within a week. I dont mind the driness in exchange for the results. Im just surprised at the outrageous price. The normal price is less than ten dollars.</li>
            <li> PLEASE READ:  This product is great(for all the reasons others have listed which I won&#x27;t repeat), however the price is way over-inflated because the manufacturer is no longer making this product.  The good news is that many other brands have products with the same active ingredient of Benzoyl Peroxide 10%, or lesser strengths if this is too harsh.  There is no reason to spend this much money on this product when you can buy essentially the same thing for a fraction of the cost.  Topix, Clean and Clear, and Glytone are examples of other products with the same active ingredient.</li>
            <li> It is back. Check your closest Walgreens!&lt;br /&gt;This soap bar lasts a long time, and clears your skin.If you have acne you know how important that is. I have seen the ridiculous amount of money that people were asking for one, so don&#x27;t get desperate..</li>
            <li> Always use this product just too pricy n I would not have got if they had in store. Won&#x27;t buy this product from here again</li>
            <li> This is clearing up my skin very nicely. Although the price is much higher than it really should be, the bar seems to last several months. In fact, it&#x27;s allowing me to get off the antibiotics for acne.</li>
            <li> Cleared an acne episode and lightened my skin. I like the product very much. It acts as a bit of a mild peel. Lavish moisturizer after washing soap off. Pretty skin after!</li>
            <li> Great Product. This came recommended from my dermatologist&#x27;s office. I am a 24 year old male with folliculitis on my chest and some acne on my back, and this definitely cleared things up. Its something that needs to be used regularly, so I&#x27;d consider purchasing in bulk. If you&#x27;re looking to try this out in general, the bar is the way to go. One bar lasted me about a month for use on my shoulders and chest/stomach area. If you have sensitive skin it may dry you out, but I have not experienced this.</li>
            <li> Shipped and received as expected. Be aware that it takes a couple weeks of daily use to clear up a breakout.</li>
            <li> This soap burned my skin terribly</li>
            <li> I have tried to find this product but was advised by CVS Pharmacy that all lines of all Panoxyl products have been discontinued....Per the manufactuer.</li>
            <li> The price of $46.00 is incorrect and is completely wrong!!!!  This product can be purchased at Rite Aid for about $7.00.</li>
            <li> This is works great, since using this my acne is under control, the only thing is I have to wash my face with it every 3 days because of the strong medicine in it but its great to bath with everyday</li>
            <li> I have 2 teenagers, boy &amp; girl.  We have tried everything for my daughter with nothing working.  So with this bar &amp; Aztec Secret Indian Healing Clay deep pore mask, she finally seems to be clearing up.  Im going to say it may be a combination for my daughter.  My son only uses the bar and thats working for him.  So definitely give this a try!! Don&#x27;t pass this one up!</li>
            <li> I started with the creamy wash about 8 weeks ago. After having my worst break out in months I started going through reviews to troubleshoot about 2 weeks ago. I switched to the bar because per the reviews people seem to slightly prefer it. And despite its drying effect, I have cut out any other products (including moisturizer) in hopes that it will allow Panoxyl to do its thing. I do see some clearing; however, my chin frequently has pimples that develop and retreat without ever popping. They were barely visible anymore, but this has brought every one of those to a whitehead so it has been a painful process. I am holding out hope as I have never seen a product reviewed so consistently well by people who seem to have similar acne stories.  I hope to update my review in a few weeks-months with more positive results.  Update: After three months of use, I can see it is finally working.  My skin is not perfect yet, but I expect to see even more improvement. As stated above, it gave me crazy breakouts for about two months.  I&#x27;m not sure if my current routine helps or if it just purged my skin and now I am seeing the benefits.  Currently, I wash with the bar, pat dry and leave for 10 minutes, spot treat with Panoxyl 3% gel, wait 20 minutes, then moisturize with Clean and Clear Dual Action moisturizer.  I find that giving time before moisturizing drys out existing acne.</li>
            <li> Dried out my skin and made my acne much worse than my usual 2% salicylic acid wash.  I do have somewhat sensitive skin though so maybe it was just me.</li>
            <li> Prompt delivery coupled with a high quality product hit the spot. A bit pricey but worth it. I&#x27;ll be back for more!</li>
            <li> Ordered this product for my grandaughter and she was pleased with the results.  She would recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;Will order again with satisfaction.</li>
            <li> My daughter swears by this product. She uses this for her back.  It&#x27;s a little pricey, but it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Works but way too many chemicals.  Much cheaper &amp; just as effective to use black tar or black coal soap.</li>
            <li> Works well. Many have indicated that this is a drying product. If your face is on the sensitive side, use this product once ever couple of days, and as you build up a tolerance, use it more often. This product works well.</li>
            <li> Bought after recommended by the 80+ year old Dermatologist, for my son. We could only find it online. Comparably priced. We saved our money with the Amazon shipping. Much better than all the OTC products we have ever tried. Works wonders with 1 prescription lotion. We saw visible results in one day with this and the Rx. Stop the insanity, see a dermatologist for the acne.</li>
            <li> This cleared up my skin when no other body wash could. Has a great price here on amazon. If your body is not working with the normal stuff you find at drug stores, give this a try before seeing a dermatologist.</li>
            <li> works temporary which i do not like. When you scrub on face for over 1 minute you have such a dry feel film for over 30 minutes, ewwww</li>
            <li> This stuff works great.</li>
            <li> i tried to use it on a mosquito bite on my arm, and leave my leg for 2 days. When used on arm it does reduce the bump down, and makes it a bit darker, but slowly fade. One on my leg didnt fade because i didnt use this and it stayed pinkish. Body, very good feeling when used. Doesn&#x27;t feel like overused like creamy wash. I suggest putting water on the soap, then soap slowly on your body. It creates a foaming lather by itself. No need to rub your hands together.</li>
            <li> My daughter has found the cure for her acne. This soap is the only thing that has ever cleared her skin. Unfortunately, we have no longer been able to find it in the drug stores. It is also unfortunate that what normally costs us $6 to $8 has become $25 to $60 online. I don&#x27;t know how long we&#x27;ll be able to afford buying this product. :(</li>
            <li> For the past few months I&#x27;ve been having some really bad breakouts. From tiny red bumps to ones with white heads and itchy ones and painful to touch ones. I&#x27;ve been so self conscious and it does take a toll on your emotions especially feeling like you&#x27;ve tried everything and nothing really works. I&#x27;ve tried going to my doctor and she just gave me ointments and antibiotics (that I didn&#x27;t take) one of the ointment was a benzoyl peroxide and after using it I noticed it did clear out a bit but it felt like my face looks bloated in the morning after putting it on at night. I got scared so I stopped using it. I figured I could be allergic to benzoyl. Then I broke out again so I went out and tried clean and clear. The ones that comes in a set sort of like proactive. Didn&#x27;t work. Then I tried proactive. Didn&#x27;t work. Then I tried doing the apple cider vinegar and it still didn&#x27;t work. After reading up some more of the ACV, someone mentioned Panoxyl and how they heard Dr Oz mention it too. So I thought ok let&#x27;s look for it. Found it at CVS for 8$ and I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day (am and pm) and I know this is probably just in my head but I swear to you, after using it just for one day, I woke up thinking damn my pimples are actually disappearing! Like the big ones are actually smaller and doesn&#x27;t look like it&#x27;s about to explode. The tiny ones on my forehead are now just tiny dark marks and the white head ones are gone and are now just kinda dark reds. It did dry out my skin around the mouth area and I&#x27;m still trying to find a good moisturizer to help with that. I&#x27;m also scared of using moisturizers because I do have oily skin so I&#x27;m afraid of it blocking out my pores and making more pimples. So if anyone can recommend a good one for oily skin that would help. It hasn&#x27;t been a week yet so right now my skin is just looking a bit better but the acne scars are still there and I still do feel like i still need some makeup to cover it. I just really hope this continues To work cuz it would really help to boost up my confidence once more.</li>
            <li> This item just isnt for me I have moderate acne and this dried out my skin so bad after 2 days of using it my skin was peeling flaking and i was breaking out more. i gave it 2 stars because the shipping was fast and the product was exactly what was ordered.</li>
    </ol>
