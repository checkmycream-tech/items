            <li>Perfect price point for such a great product.</li>
            <li>i received this pencil quickly and in a very nice protective envelope.  </li>
            <li>Works perfectly just as she suggested for the unexpected use for this item.  </li>
            <li>I tried it on and loved the rich color.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It also sharpens easily, and the nice smudger works well.</li>
            <li>She uses it on lips (yes lips, not eyes) on so many of her makeovers.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>

            <li>Love the blending tool on the end.</li>
            <li>Better than in a retail or drug store.</li>
            <li>Nobody noticed that I actually filled them in!</li>
            <li>I use this as a lip liner very lite and it looks great with nude lipsticks or lip glosses.</li>
            <li>it blended better than any eyeliner I&#x27;ve tried, making a smoky eye was so easy.</li>
            <li>Really creates a good brown smokey eye when needed, it isn&#x27;t too strong</li>
            <li>I love this eyepencil, the two most things I love is this shade of brown, you can use it intense or use the smudge tip and it will give you a very light brown, you control the shade.</li>
            <li>Easy to remove at night when taking off the rest of my makeup.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and affordable.</li>
            <li>Goes on easily and smooth.</li>
            <li>The color is perfect, not too dark if used lightly and sparingly.</li>
            <li>The color is a rich brown and it goes on easily.  </li>
            <li>and I always used the blond color which was a light brown</li>
            <li>I bought it as a lip liner and as such is great.</li>
            <li>I have been using the Covergirl Perfect Blend brow pencil everyday for 7 years now</li>
            <li>The shade (mink) is also too light for my brows.</li>
            <li>and she was right!</li>
            <li>OK pencel, but don&#x27;t really like for the reason I bought it (lip pencil)  </li>
            <li>for the &amp;#34;price&amp;#34; not bad .  </li>
            <li>It sharpens nicely, glides and blends smoothly, and lasts a long time!</li>
            <li>Do use it quite often because love the&lt;br /&gt;color , a taupe brown not real dark.</li>
            <li>Goes on very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I figured this was worth a try, I am always willing to try new things, this just didn&#x27;t work out.</li>
            <li>I do need to be careful not to apply too much pressure, because you can easily darken too much.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>Very blendable and dark enough brown that it still looks sexy and night worthy.</li>
            <li>Learned something new!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used so many different styles of eyeliners, but I found myself coming back to this one.</li>
            <li>When your pencil is too light for your brows, you &amp; others will easily see the penciling in the sunlight, and sometimes under artificial light.</li>
            <li>I love it because you can sharpen it as much or as little as you&#x27;d like for a finer or bolder line.</li>
            <li>I lightly line my lips and then use the other side to smudge/blend it in</li>
            <li>It actually works really well for a nude-colored liner!  </li>
            <li>So far it seems to last and work pretty well since I wear my hair darker now</li>
            <li>not long wearing but really pigmented</li>
            <li>Not so soft though that the tip crumbles off every time you use it.</li>
            <li>I really like this pencil, especially for eyebrows, though it can be used as an eyeliner as well.</li>
            <li>I used this pencil to fill in the lost hairs and the color blends in so naturally with my brows.</li>
            <li>All the techniques I use, (which are recommended by professional make up artists)</li>
            <li>I am going for a natural look.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really know what to say other than I really like this pencil.</li>
            <li>but yet it will come off easily when you go to take it off, and I forgot the other fabulous thing is that their pencils are a bit of a creamy consistency, so it doesn&#x27;t pull your eye area, because we don&#x27;t want that, that&#x27;s bad,  and the creamy consistency also helps it smudge easily with the tip.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t drag too much, and the color works with a lot of nude and lighter-colored lipsticks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I actually bought this to use as a lipliner since Cara from the Maskcara blog uses it to contour her lips in quite a few of her tutorials.  </li>

            <li> I thinK I will order a couple back ups because they are hard to find in the store!</li>
            <li> and this is just a little darker which I needed.</li>

            <li> I cannot be without this eyepencil, it is a staple in my everyday makeup look.</li>
            <li> I usually buy like 2-3 at a time</li>

            <li> This pencil was dry and incredibly difficult to use.  No wonder it is so inexpensive...</li>
            <li> not long wearing but really pigmented</li>
            <li> I use this color for lip liner and also brow filler.  Looks great for both and blends easily as well</li>
            <li> Staple for years.  Inexpensive and works well.  Goes on easily and smooth.</li>
            <li> So far it seems to last and work pretty well since I wear my hair darker now and I always used the blond color which was a light brown and this is just a little darker which I needed. its not too dark though which I like.</li>

            <li> Bought this after reading review from Maskcara.com She uses it on lips (yes lips, not eyes) on so many of her makeovers. I swear I have the hardest time finding a lip color that looks good on me, and I really liked this. I lightly line my lips and then use the other side to smudge/blend it in so it&#x27;s not so dramatic. Pair with a nude or peachy color and I think it looks great! Seems to last a long time too! And can&#x27;t beat the price with Subscribe and Save, wahoo!</li>
            <li> Purchased this based on the recommendation of maskcara.com. Works perfectly just as she suggested for the unexpected use for this item.  Learned something new!</li>
            <li> Love this product. Will be reordering!</li>
            <li> I love this eyepencil, the two most things I love is this shade of brown, you can use it intense or use the smudge tip and it will give you a very light brown, you control the shade. I cannot be without this eyepencil, it is a staple in my everyday makeup look. and you don&#x27;t have to worry about it coming off or running during the day. but yet it will come off easily when you go to take it off, and I forgot the other fabulous thing is that their pencils are a bit of a creamy consistency, so it doesn&#x27;t pull your eye area, because we don&#x27;t want that, that&#x27;s bad,  and the creamy consistency also helps it smudge easily with the tip.</li>

            <li> I have been using the Covergirl Perfect Blend brow pencil everyday for 7 years now and I LOVE IT. I usually buy like 2-3 at a time just so I have them in the house- I do not want to run the risk of running out. Perfect price point for such a great product. Better than department store brow pencils for a fraction of the price. Easy to remove at night when taking off the rest of my makeup. I get so many compliments on my eyebrows and I owe it all to Cover Girl!</li>
            <li> Have used this for years and hope they never change it.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t find this product in Germany so I ordered it here. Use it for brows and lip liner and love it!</li>
            <li> I love covergirl eyeliner I use this pencil as an eyeliner and to help fill in my eyebrows on days they look too thin and it doesn&#x27;t look too dark</li>
            <li> Color is perfect for lip liner.  Stays on all day. I have not used the blender end so I can&#x27;t review that</li>
            <li> I love this pencil to line my lips and then i blend the lines for the start of a great nude lip! It seems scary dark and looks very 90&#x27;s before you blend the lines. Don&#x27;t be scared.</li>
            <li> I heard about this product from blogger Cara (maskcara.com). She swore it would work well on any skin tone and she was right! I love it!</li>
            <li> Very blendable and dark enough brown that it still looks sexy and night worthy. Not so soft though that the tip crumbles off every time you use it.</li>
            <li> Item is just as described. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used so many different styles of eyeliners, but I found myself coming back to this one. I love it because you can sharpen it as much or as little as you&#x27;d like for a finer or bolder line. Also, it&#x27;s cheap enough that I don&#x27;t feel bad sharpening it often and going through it more quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It wears well and doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes the way some other brands do. I also like the smudge tool on the end for a bit of a smoky look.</li>
            <li> Color is great. I use this for my brows, not as eyeliner. Goes on very soft and smooth. Love the blending tool on the end. Great price. Better than in a retail or drug store.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know what to say other than I really like this pencil.</li>
            <li> The color is a rich brown and it goes on easily.  Appreciate the sponge applicator on the reverse and, the pencil sharpens well, which isn&#x27;t always the case.</li>
            <li> I really like this pencil, especially for eyebrows, though it can be used as an eyeliner as well. The color is perfect, not too dark if used lightly and sparingly.</li>
            <li> I use this to fill in my browns as it matches perfectly.</li>
            <li> Have been looking for this in the store, but they always seem to be out. Glad I found it, as it&#x27;s a great brow pencil for me.</li>
            <li> I had an eyebrow wax accident with a beautician a couple years ago. I used this pencil to fill in the lost hairs and the color blends in so naturally with my brows. Nobody noticed that I actually filled them in! I do need to be careful not to apply too much pressure, because you can easily darken too much.&lt;br /&gt;For the money, this beats out any other brand you can pay up to $10+ for. It sharpens nicely, glides and blends smoothly, and lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> Drags a little going on,color does not stay as well as hoped.&lt;br /&gt;But for the &amp;#34;price&amp;#34; not bad .  Do use it quite often because love the&lt;br /&gt;color , a taupe brown not real dark.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been penciling my eyebrows for 12 years. I have never used a \\&quot;smugger\\&quot; tool before, and thought I&#x27;d give it a try. All the techniques I use, (which are recommended by professional make up artists) I found very difficult to do with this pencil. The shade (mink) is also too light for my brows. When your pencil is too light for your brows, you &amp; others will easily see the penciling in the sunlight, and sometimes under artificial light. I am going for a natural look. I figured this was worth a try, I am always willing to try new things, this just didn&#x27;t work out.</li>
            <li> Really creates a good brown smokey eye when needed, it isn&#x27;t too strong so it&#x27;s great for daytime when I just need some neutral colour on my lids too. It lines my lids great too. Easy to use and affordable. Kudos Covergirl.</li>
            <li> I use it as a lip liner. I bought several at a time for my purse, my car, and my makeup bag.</li>
            <li> OK pencel, but don&#x27;t really like for the reason I bought it (lip pencil)  Like it for lining lower eyeline and waterline...subtle for summer.</li>
            <li> I use this as a lip liner very lite and it looks great with nude lipsticks or lip glosses. I thinK I will order a couple back ups because they are hard to find in the store!</li>
