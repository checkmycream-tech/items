    <ol>
            <li>Great, speedy service.</li>
            <li>These are great for leaving in your hair for a couple of hours or even overnight.  </li>
            <li>Great for curling my hair.  </li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>One very satisfied customer.</li>
            <li>What more does one need?!  </li>
            <li>liked it, liked that it was available.</li>
            <li>The foam that is used is very cheap.</li>
            <li>I was quite pleased with  the service from this company-</li>
            <li>I also satisfied with the quality of the products offered.  </li>
            <li>good price - shipped very fast - described</li>
            <li>The order came very quickly.</li>
            <li>but they turned out to be flimsy &amp; broke easily.</li>
            <li>They are not of the highest quality, but they did the trick and left nice curls!</li>
            <li>; foam roller will work as well, as the foam compresses so much, but will hold more hair.</li>
            <li>I like these rolls very much!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re exactly the size I was looking for and they do their job!</li>
            <li>It gave my hair a nice wave the next morning.</li>
            <li>just what I wanted and received them very fast</li>
            <li>Arrived on time with exact request  </li>
            <li>Soft and comfortable</li>
            <li>4 of these detached at the joint on the first use.</li>
            <li>So, they are pretty much useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was replacing some old rollers with more pliable white &amp;#34;clips&amp;#34;, these did not meet the bill.</li>
            <li>I rolled my hair last night and took them out a few hours later, all of the ones I used won&#x27;t make it many more uses.</li>
            <li>Foam Rollers as described, just what I wanted, throught closure was very hard, I just used the foams and put them on closures that I had before, overall was great and it&#x27;s what I ordered</li>
            <li>Wish it were made in the usa like it used to be back when I first bought them</li>
            <li>The small pink sponge rollers were the perfect size for really tight curls for cheer competition.  </li>
            <li>great for my daughters halloween costume as &#x27;crazy cat lady.</li>
            <li>this particular, small, foam curlers are rare to find.  </li>
            <li>The size and foam is okay, but the plastic fastener is so stiff that you need two hands to get them opened and closed</li>
            <li>I have short, thin hair &amp; these rollers are gentle and comfortable.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;They were really small, more than I expected; I didn&#x27;t need kinky curls, but as a novice I didn&#x27;t know what size to order.</li>
            <li>I would readily buy other products from this company &amp; would recommend it to friends.</li>

            <li> I would readily buy other products from this company &amp; would recommend it to friends.</li>
            <li> closed   </li>
            <li> the snap on the rollers is incredibly difficult to do and undo resulting the bending of the entire unit.</li>
            <li> received 14 small rollers at a charge of almost one dollar for each roller.  </li>
            <li> These are truly miserable, they tangled my daughters hair, left it in such horrid condition that we had to take her to a saloon for a deep conditioning treatment.</li>
            <li> The other rollers were very hard on my hair - they made my hair break..  </li>
            <li> that was even worse, and shorter (held less hair).</li>
            <li> The clasp was difficult to snap closed.  </li>
            <li> The foam on the Hollywood Pink Foam Rollers was very thin.  </li>
            <li> And it is too difficult to re-snap them in your hair when you try because the plastic is very stiff and hard.</li>
            <li> and that makes them difficult to use.</li>
            <li> Out of the 14 rollers 4 are useless.  </li>
            <li> Too disgusted to bother shipping it back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid I will not find a replacement, as I bought another set at Sally&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I found the clips on the end of the roller very difficult to attach and release.  </li>
            <li> Terrible inflated price and shoddy workmanship</li>
            <li> Snags the ends of your hair. :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>

            <li> The small pink sponge rollers were the perfect size for really tight curls for cheer competition.  Ordering these online saved me time and money! The order came very quickly.</li>
            <li> Great, speedy service. Arrived on time with exact request  Description matched product, inexpensive. What more does one need?!  Thank you. One very satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> The size and foam is okay, but the plastic fastener is so stiff that you need two hands to get them opened and closed and that makes them difficult to use. These are not like the ones I remember using when I was a kid.</li>
            <li> just what I wanted and received them very fast</li>
            <li> The foam on the Hollywood Pink Foam Rollers was very thin.  The clasp was difficult to snap closed.  I think they are going to wear out in a very short time.</li>
            <li> I was quite pleased with  the service from this company- I also satisfied with the quality of the products offered.  I had purchased  a  different brand (but similar style) of    roller - but they turned out to be flimsy &amp; broke easily. The other rollers were very hard on my hair - they made my hair break..  I have short, thin hair &amp; these rollers are gentle and comfortable.  I would readily buy other products from this company &amp; would recommend it to friends. &lt;br /&gt;Thanks &lt;br /&gt;Catherine Cassel</li>
            <li> These are great for leaving in your hair for a couple of hours or even overnight.  It gave my hair a nice wave the next morning.</li>
            <li> great for my daughters halloween costume as &#x27;crazy cat lady. Had these curlers hanging from her hair. I did not actually use them to curl her hair, just for a costume.</li>
            <li> good price - shipped very fast - described well -</li>
            <li> I went to an Oscar party as Bradley Cooper from American Hustle. The curlers helped, but could have been tighter.</li>
            <li> the snap on the rollers is incredibly difficult to do and undo resulting the bending of the entire unit. I rolled my hair last night and took them out a few hours later, all of the ones I used won&#x27;t make it many more uses. if any at all. I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I like these rolls very much! They&#x27;re exactly the size I was looking for and they do their job! I would buy them again!</li>
            <li> Snags the ends of your hair. :( I guess you could uses &amp;#34;papers&amp;#34; to prevent that, OR just buy different rollers.</li>
            <li> Great for curling my hair.  No sticky thinks going into my head.  Soft and comfortable</li>
            <li> I found the clips on the end of the roller very difficult to attach and release.  I should have probably purchased a larger size.</li>
            <li> 4 of these detached at the joint on the first use. I snapped them back together, but from then on, they detached every time I tried to roll my hair. While &amp;#34;fixing&amp;#34; them, the foam tore. And it is too difficult to re-snap them in your hair when you try because the plastic is very stiff and hard. So, they are pretty much useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They were really small, more than I expected; I didn&#x27;t need kinky curls, but as a novice I didn&#x27;t know what size to order. They are 1/2&amp;#34; in diameter- thinner than a chapstick or a sharpie. A 1&amp;#34; foam roller will work as well, as the foam compresses so much, but will hold more hair. I was replacing some old rollers with more pliable white &amp;#34;clips&amp;#34;, these did not meet the bill. I&#x27;m afraid I will not find a replacement, as I bought another set at Sally&#x27;s that was even worse, and shorter (held less hair).</li>
            <li> Great product. Wish it were made in the usa like it used to be back when I first bought them</li>

            <li> I bought these to do my daughters&#x27; hair for their cheer competition.  They are not of the highest quality, but they did the trick and left nice curls!</li>
            <li> received 14 small rollers at a charge of almost one dollar for each roller.  Out of the 14 rollers 4 are useless.  They are too short to snap  closed   So I am  left with ten working rollers.  Too disgusted to bother shipping it back. Don&#x27;t buy these rollers   Terrible inflated price and shoddy workmanship</li>
            <li> this particular, small, foam curlers are rare to find.  liked it, liked that it was available.</li>
            <li> These are truly miserable, they tangled my daughters hair, left it in such horrid condition that we had to take her to a saloon for a deep conditioning treatment. The foam that is used is very cheap.</li>
