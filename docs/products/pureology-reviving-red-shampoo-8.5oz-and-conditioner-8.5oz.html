            <li>Loved this product!</li>
            <li>Age 67 and the shampoo works great on my colored hair..</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m happy I did.</li>
            <li>I have found using Pureology to be a great extender to my hair color.  </li>
            <li>great thing about purchasing it here........</li>
            <li>Going the sample route was a good plan</li>
            <li>I have always loved this shampoo and conditioner and it was cheaper than at my salon.</li>
            <li>this shampoo and conditioner is great, it leaves my hair feeling smooth</li>
            <li>am not as thrilled with the shampoo</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted at a great price.</li>
            <li>and it is not for the better.  </li>
            <li>So glad I looked on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>This stuff is the only product that smooths and softens my hair, and keeps the dye from fading for quite a while.  :D</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo .</li>
            <li>The shampoo I&#x27;m in love with.</li>
            <li>I love Pureology, but there are better shampoos they make.</li>
            <li>It smells pretty good though</li>
            <li>Best possible shampoo and conditioner for colored red hair and it smells great</li>
            <li>it works the best with my hair versus every other product I have ever tried!</li>
            <li>I have fine hair with lots of volume</li>
            <li>otherwise it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>all super satisfied with the products.</li>
            <li>Redkin did a much better job at keeping the color fresh and it is not a brand that I use often at all.  </li>
            <li>Even though I color my hair, it&#x27;s pretty healthy.</li>
            <li>It really helps her color hold true and keeps her hair healthy and shiny.</li>
            <li>It does a good enough job and cleaning and conditioning my hair but does nothing for color.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to invest in a good moisturizing conditioner instead and just avoid shampoo add much as possible.</li>
            <li>Definitely the best product I have used for red hair.  </li>
            <li>This is the Best Color Care Shampoo Ever,  I am a Natural Redhead &amp; IF I were to let my Roots grow, they are Pure White.  </li>
            <li>Light Intense Auburn!)........</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have the oil most young women have.  </li>
            <li>As a woman who has just this year started doing my own red hair color</li>
            <li>I never felt that my hair was totally clean after using the shampoo, and the conditioner didn&#x27;t seem to condition very well.</li>
            <li>I dye my hair light intense copper about every 3 months, and it gets really frizzy.</li>
            <li>Really works!  </li>
            <li>I love Pureology products but had to send this one back.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going back to the Super Smooth stuff.</li>
            <li>Though I am happy with it, I think I will go back to the Hydrate products mainly for the reasons listed above.</li>
            <li>I have super long hair and it tangles easily</li>
            <li>I have been coloring my red for more than 10 years now and my hair really holds on to the color well.  </li>
            <li>I have had good luck with Pureology products in the past</li>
            <li>/&gt;Con- like all pureology products i find i use a large amount.</li>
            <li>its the real deal.</li>
            <li>I usually put oils in my hair before washing, so the first time I used this shampoo my hair looked nice but as u kept using it it dryed out my hair if I had known</li>
            <li>My hair is silky soft and the color remains intense.</li>
            <li>I used to have to wash it everyday and now can skip a day and not look like I dumped grease on top of my head.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wanted a more copper red than blue red.</li>
            <li>I love the super smooth shampoo and conditioner, but this is terrible and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li>My hair seems to have faded just as fast with this line as it has using other red hair care products.</li>
            <li>I got the sample kit of this because I was leery of the drying effects that others complained about and didn&#x27;t want to drop the money on the full size and end up hating it.</li>

            <li> Could not get the smell out of my hair all day long.</li>
            <li> it was HALF THE PRICE of the same product, same size at Ulta.  </li>

            <li> Best possible shampoo and conditioner for colored red hair and it smells great</li>
            <li> Age 67 and the shampoo works great on my colored hair..</li>
            <li> This stuff works well &amp; a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Best hair care anywhere</li>
            <li> I have my hair color every 4-5 weeks and this shampoo puts the luster, and the red back into what has faded.  I ash my hair only every 3-4 days unless  (but then I am less young today than yesterday)  I don&#x27;t have the oil most young women have.  I use the red hair oil treatment.</li>
            <li> I got it because my hair is red, but it seemed a little drying, not enought moisture  to me at least</li>
            <li> I have fine hair with lots of volume I usually put oils in my hair before washing, so the first time I used this shampoo my hair looked nice but as u kept using it it dryed out my hair if I had known alcohol was the second ingredient in both the shampoo and conditioner I wouldn&#x27;t have bought it, still have a lot left but no longer using it, and It was expensive</li>
            <li> i have heard from alot of people to try this product for years, never did  well now I wish I had. this shampoo and conditioner is great, it leaves my hair feeling smooth my color lasts longer.</li>
            <li> I have been coloring my red for more than 10 years now and my hair really holds on to the color well.  I have had good luck with Pureology products in the past so thought I would try this shampoo and conditioner.  It does a good enough job and cleaning and conditioning my hair but does nothing for color.  Redkin did a much better job at keeping the color fresh and it is not a brand that I use often at all.  Not sure what is going on with the products and quality at Pureology in the past six or so months but there has definitely been a change and it is not for the better.  It&#x27;s a shame.</li>
            <li> I had no problem with shipping or the product. Was nerves about buying them but I&#x27;m happy I did. I have nothing wrong to say.</li>
            <li> This is the Best Color Care Shampoo Ever,  I am a Natural Redhead &amp; IF I were to let my Roots grow, they are Pure White.  With Pureology My Roots are Blond, NEVER White.</li>
            <li> I paid a lot of money for what? I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference between this product and cheaper red products. The conditioner doesn&#x27;t even condition my rather dry hair. I&#x27;m going to invest in a good moisturizing conditioner instead and just avoid shampoo add much as possible.</li>
            <li> As a woman who has just this year started doing my own red hair color (Garnier Nutrisse, Light Intense Auburn!)........I have found using Pureology to be a great extender to my hair color.  I used to use regular Pureology when I had blonde highlights and found it to be quality then as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The great thing about purchasing it here........it was HALF THE PRICE of the same product, same size at Ulta.  So glad I looked on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. it works the best with my hair versus every other product I have ever tried! no joke. its the real deal.</li>
            <li> I bought these as a gift for my daughter and she loves them.. It really helps her color hold true and keeps her hair healthy and shiny.</li>
            <li> I never felt that my hair was totally clean after using the shampoo, and the conditioner didn&#x27;t seem to condition very well. But it did help keep the red in my hair longer.</li>
            <li> I have dyed my hair red for years and used various products including several of the Pureology line. After using this I still prefer the Pureology Hydrate for the smell and texture it gives my hair. The Red shampoo does suds up as well as the others, but does have an odd smell as other reviewers have noted. My hair seems to have faded just as fast with this line as it has using other red hair care products. Though I am happy with it, I think I will go back to the Hydrate products mainly for the reasons listed above.</li>
            <li> I got the sample kit of this because I was leery of the drying effects that others complained about and didn&#x27;t want to drop the money on the full size and end up hating it. Going the sample route was a good plan because I did, in fact, hate it. Even though I color my hair, it&#x27;s pretty healthy. While I used this, you wouldn&#x27;t know that - my hair was dry, coarse, not at all shiny, and constantly tangled (getting a brush or comb through it was near impossible and more than a little painful). I love the super smooth shampoo and conditioner, but this is terrible and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it. It smells pretty good though, I&#x27;ll give it that much at least.</li>
            <li> This is some of the best shampoo and conditioner I have found! I dye my hair light intense copper about every 3 months, and it gets really frizzy. This stuff is the only product that smooths and softens my hair, and keeps the dye from fading for quite a while.  :D</li>
            <li> Loved this product! I would recommend it to anyone</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo . I have been using this product for about a year now and I will use it for awhile</li>
            <li> This conditioner makes my hair so soft i can brush through it when it wet without putting any product in. I have gone through almost every store brand, salon brand and deep conditioning mask and oil i can find and i am buying a giant bottle of this conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;I am not as thrilled with the shampoo but it is good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con- like all pureology products i find i use a large amount. (my hair is down to my lower back)</li>
            <li> Really works!  My color lasts longer between visits to the salon!  I use with copper reflector which seems to help a lot too,</li>
            <li> Definitely the best product I have used for red hair.  My hair is silky soft and the color remains intense.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted at a great price.</li>
            <li> The shampoo I&#x27;m in love with. It cleans my hair and allows me to maintain my red at the same time. I used to have to wash it everyday and now can skip a day and not look like I dumped grease on top of my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner however is not as affective on my hair. I have super long hair and it tangles easily so it&#x27;s a battle to brush out afterwards. I recommend getting a detangler if you encounter this problem as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all super satisfied with the products.</li>
            <li> it has too much blue in it for my hair color. Wanted a more copper red than blue red. otherwise it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> I love Pureology, but there are better shampoos they make. This one does tend to dry out hair. I recommend Strength Cure instead.</li>
            <li> It dried out my hair and I didn&#x27;t see any affect on my red color retention.  I&#x27;m going back to the Super Smooth stuff.</li>
            <li> The smell is like that of at home hair dye. Could not get the smell out of my hair all day long. I love Pureology products but had to send this one back.</li>
            <li> I have always loved this shampoo and conditioner and it was cheaper than at my salon. This is the thing for red hair.</li>
