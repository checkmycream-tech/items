    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This is the best product that he has found for his skin condition.</li>

            <li>I am very happy with my purchase of Zincon.</li>
            <li>Zincon shampoo is a very good product.</li>
            <li>It is somewhat drying, so good moisturizing conditioner needed!</li>
            <li>Good but not the best</li>

            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for over 25 years and it is great.  </li>

            <li>It has a very nice fragrance.</li>
            <li>Just using it once I saw a remarkable difference.  </li>
            <li>Zincon Dandruff Shampoo is without a doubt the best shampoo available in the consumer market.</li>
            <li>The original, and still the best formula.</li>
            <li>Lathers great and really works the best on dandruff and scalp.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m extremely happy to be able to get it through Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I am all the time satisfied with Amazon&#x27;s service!</li>
            <li>am so glad I did!</li>
            <li>It works amazingly.</li>
            <li>Nice and foamy.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s wonderful for keeping dandruff in check and leaves a fresh clean smell to the hair.  </li>
            <li>The product arrived quickly and we were happy to find it easy to order through Amazon.</li>
            <li>My hair is clean dandruff free and it smells great.</li>
            <li>Good seller, and quick shipping.</li>
            <li>, it smells great too, makes my hair look great and also keeps my dry skin problem at bay.  </li>
            <li>It smells great, is very creamy and suds up nicely.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have ordered elsewhere, but find Amazon&#x27;s price competitive, and service unexcelled anywhere.  </li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>/&gt;Different shampoos work best for different people.  </li>
            <li>This was recommended many years ago by a skin physician.</li>
            <li>ITS BETTER THAN I SPEC</li>
            <li>I have used this for many years.</li>
            <li>I am sooo pleased and will be buying tons more on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My brothers are balding or losing precious hair by not trying it.</li>
            <li>I really love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>Works pretty good.</li>
            <li>My order was fulfilled quickly and efficiently and, best of all, I received free shipping because I had enough items in my order to qualify.</li>
            <li>Deliver of this was very, very quick.  </li>
            <li>Great for dandruff, and treats several fungal conditions as well (primarily tinea infections of skin).  </li>
            <li>My uncle (who also had eczema of the scalp) used this for several years with great results.</li>
            <li>After 1 wash my hair was noticably dandruff free.</li>
            <li>It DOES clear dandruff, but what good is that if it causes damage to my scalp?........</li>
            <li>This is particularly significant since it appears that it is no longer available for sale in any retail stores.</li>
            <li>I just got through my first bottle and now I&#x27;m buying two more to stock up.</li>
            <li>It is great for dry itchy scalp.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t work great at first, until I finally started washing with it twice as the directions said.</li>
            <li>It really works better than any medicated shampoo on the market.  </li>
            <li>My father&#x27;s doctor recommended Zincon many years ago and it worked very well for him.  </li>
            <li>I made sure to follow directions, but the irritation it causes is just too much.</li>
            <li>My husband has a kind of dander that usually has to be taken care of with a prescription shampoo, but with this and rotating with another couple kind of specialty otc shampoos, his hair and scalp is fine and we don&#x27;t have to buy the prescription stuff.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the product several times now, and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li>and this is the first time that my hair felt really clean at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>We have tried many shampoos to treat my 17 year old daughter&#x27;s dandruff issues.  </li>
            <li>For some reason, I cannot find locally any more, but available on-line.  </li>
            <li>I used this only one time, but so far, seems great..</li>
            <li>If you think you are losing hair while you are young, better try it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great daily general shampoo.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for at least 20 years and it works great on my mild case of psoriasis/dandruff.</li>
            <li>I rate zincon very high!</li>
            <li>At first I thought this shampoo didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>First of all, can we talk about the price?</li>
            <li>It has absolutely the same ingredients as good old Head&amp;SHoulders.</li>
            <li>I am most grateful it continues to be manufactured, and available to the general public through Amazon.</li>
            <li>Zincon is great for everyday use and completely gets rid of my dandruff and itchy scalp.</li>
            <li>For some reason, it&#x27;s hard to find in the stores, so it&#x27;s not always available, I was glad to see it here</li>
            <li>My husband uses this product and really likes it.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t feel much of difference using this product.</li>
            <li>I wish that it really works.</li>
            <li>Works very well</li>
            <li>but this stuff clear the issue right</li>
            <li>My scalps feels so much better and less itching since using this product twice already.  </li>
            <li>It worked much better than the Head &amp; Shoulders I previously used.</li>
            <li>Some as high as 2%.</li>
            <li>As stated above, it has mostly arrested my mild hair loss, due to the zinc content and deep cleansing ability that dissolves the DHT, that is one of primary culprits of male hair loss!  </li>
            <li>Although it is a shampoo to treat dandruff and seborrheic dermatitis, it is gentle and leaves your hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>Bought product as alternative to ones normally use.</li>
            <li>my scalp is almost normal.</li>
            <li>After I moved to new apartment, the UPS guy put my package without any notice (even not knock the door.)</li>
            <li>When I got older and developed the same problem, I knew exactly which shampoo to turn to.  </li>
            <li>However, Amazon was willing to replace my order and I finally got this item today!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It burned my scalp and made my hair shed more than usual.</li>
            <li>It does the job, and leaves my hair shiny, soft and manageable...unusual for a therapeutic shampoo!</li>
            <li>For some reason it is no longer carried by the drugstores near me (Walgreens, CVS)</li>
            <li>Hair is soft and managable as is</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been living with flakes almost my whole life and finding ways to cover them up, but now I finally found a way to get rid of them.</li>
            <li>It also leaves your hair soft.</li>
            <li>so I only wash my hair once a week, and it wasn&#x27;t strong enough to stave off the dandruff for that long a period of time.</li>
            <li>Let me start with a general warning for all amazon customers looking for a dandruff fighting shampoo: they don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s saved (me) a 83 year old from baldness from 1978 to present.</li>
            <li>I have tried literally every OTC brand of shampoos for every type of scalp condition out there and most made it worse.</li>
            <li>Her skin is extremely dry and sensitive to shampoos.  </li>

            <li> It&#x27;s saved (me) a 83 year old from baldness from 1978 to present.</li>
            <li> I have tried literally every OTC brand of shampoos for every type of scalp condition out there and most made it worse.</li>
            <li> Her skin is extremely dry and sensitive to shampoos.  </li>
            <li> So far after a month or so of use it has only slightly lessened the dandruff (and only with near-constant upkeep).</li>
            <li> I use it off and on when it flares up and for occasional dry, itchy scalp.  </li>
            <li> Considering that our scalps become immune to shampoos it is wise to have a variety of medicated shampoos on hand for that dreadful time you absolutely need one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Head &amp; Shoulders and a few other products, but they really did not help me.  </li>
            <li> I have tried numerous products with various active ingredients (even some with the same active ingredient as Zincon), over-the-counter and prescription , and some helped the itching, but nothing stopped the embarrassing snowfall of flakes.  </li>
            <li> I can get the same product at the dollar store with the same ingredients for a lot less money</li>
            <li> Other dandruff shampoos fell short.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a specific brand of dandruff shampoo but Amazon Rep. recommended this product when it arrived my daughter began using the product and it worked just as well as the other shampoo if not</li>
            <li> I alternate between products every other day</li>
            <li> My results were the same as other dandruff shampoos.</li>
            <li> and I believe mine is extremely severe and GROSS.</li>
            <li> It helped to relieve my dry scalp.  </li>
            <li> Finally after a few years of trying various shampoos, she&#x27;s found if she uses Zincon shampoo every other shampoo, she no longer has dandruff.  </li>
            <li> In 30 years of medical practice, this is one of few OTC products I could recommend without reservation.  </li>
            <li> I carefully checked the inactive ingredients listed.  </li>
            <li> I recently switched to weekly tea rinses and glycolix shampoo and not only has this process stopped the hairfall, but my dandruff is slowly disappearing.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it every day, and I don&#x27;t use it on my entire head ( I have long, thick hair).</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It may work better/worse for other people however.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will find other products contain the active ingredient &amp;#34;Pyrithione Zinc (1%)&amp;#34; .</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years; but is not easy to find!</li>
            <li> If you want to fight dandruff take cold showers instead of hot, stop using hair gel, and (believe it or not) use Vaseline to groom your hair (even if it brings Grease flash backs).</li>
            <li> Looked online and price was Crazy High!</li>
            <li> So I used the rinse and repeat method and after a few days all of my flakes were gone.</li>
            <li> No more itching and flaking.</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> After raving about Nizoral a few months back, I was very disappointed to learn about the sky rocketing prices of the product now.</li>
            <li> My dandruff has decreased.</li>
            <li> I have seborrheic dermatitis; not only does my scalp get painfully itchy and tight, but I also have horrible flaking.  </li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> It works. Had scalp dryness with itchy red spots, only during the northern heating season. Selenium shampoos would knock it back some but this stuff clear the issue right up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will find other products contain the active ingredient &amp;#34;Pyrithione Zinc (1%)&amp;#34; . Some as high as 2%. Just search &amp;#34;Pyrithione Zinc&amp;#34; here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is the same as Head &amp; Shoulders and more expensive. I will not buy again. Nothing against the seller, it is the product.</li>
            <li> We have tried many shampoos to treat my 17 year old daughter&#x27;s dandruff issues.  Her skin is extremely dry and sensitive to shampoos.  Finally after a few years of trying various shampoos, she&#x27;s found if she uses Zincon shampoo every other shampoo, she no longer has dandruff.  This stuff works!</li>
            <li> I have seborrheic dermatitis; not only does my scalp get painfully itchy and tight, but I also have horrible flaking.  I have tried numerous products with various active ingredients (even some with the same active ingredient as Zincon), over-the-counter and prescription , and some helped the itching, but nothing stopped the embarrassing snowfall of flakes.  Just using it once I saw a remarkable difference.  I&#x27;ve used the product several times now, and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li> This is a great shampoo for someone with scalp issues, not just dandruff problems. It smells great, is very creamy and suds up nicely.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this shampoo. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Great product. In 30 years of medical practice, this is one of few OTC products I could recommend without reservation.  Great for dandruff, and treats several fungal conditions as well (primarily tinea infections of skin).  For some reason, I cannot find locally any more, but available on-line.  I have ordered elsewhere, but find Amazon&#x27;s price competitive, and service unexcelled anywhere.  I&#x27;ve bought books at a drugstore, so why not shampoo from a bookstore?[[ASIN:B000GCUU98 Zincon Medicated Dandruff Shampoo: 4 OZ]]</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for over 25 years and it is great.  Although it is a shampoo to treat dandruff and seborrheic dermatitis, it is gentle and leaves your hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I carefully checked the inactive ingredients listed.  They did not include sulfates but when I received my order today, there were the sulfates on the inactive ingredients.  I shall return my purchase!</li>
            <li> Good but not the best</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended Zincon for my seborrhea.  I use it off and on when it flares up and for occasional dry, itchy scalp.  It really works better than any medicated shampoo on the market.  I love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Zincon for 30 years!  I love it, it smells great too, makes my hair look great and also keeps my dry skin problem at bay.  For some reason, it&#x27;s hard to find in the stores, so it&#x27;s not always available, I was glad to see it here so I fan buy it in bulk quantity!</li>
            <li> My husband uses this product and really likes it.  When we could not find it in stores we went on line and ordered it there.  When we needed to re-order the product (Zincon Medicated Dandruff Shampoo) we found we could order it through Amazon.  The product arrived quickly and we were happy to find it easy to order through Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Zincon for dandruff (seborrhea) for thirty years.  I think it&#x27;s the zinc in Zincon that makes it work for me.  For some reason it is no longer carried by the drugstores near me (Walgreens, CVS) so I&#x27;m ordering it from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Different shampoos work best for different people.  Dermatologists say if you use the same shampoo constantly it will stop working and recommend rotating among three or four different ones.  In my case, this is the only one that works, so I use it exclusively and it continues to work.  It may or may not work for you. It depends on the underlying cause of your dandruff.</li>
            <li> This was recommended many years ago by a skin physician. This is the best product that he has found for his skin condition. I order a case at the time. I rate zincon very high!</li>
            <li> My husband has a kind of dander that usually has to be taken care of with a prescription shampoo, but with this and rotating with another couple kind of specialty otc shampoos, his hair and scalp is fine and we don&#x27;t have to buy the prescription stuff.</li>
            <li> zincon is the only shampoo to use in the winter time when the heat in the house effects your scalp. As soon as the sun goes away here in Michigan for the winter the only shampoo to use is Zincon. It will keep your scalp healed for the winter and keeps the egzama away.</li>
            <li> I have eczema of the scalp and this works wonderfully to keep it in check. Other dandruff shampoos fell short. I also like that the shampoo doesn&#x27;t smell medicated. It has a very nice fragrance. My uncle (who also had eczema of the scalp) used this for several years with great results.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for at least 20 years and it works great on my mild case of psoriasis/dandruff.</li>
            <li> This is the same as Head&amp;SHoulders, just 4 times more expensive. It has absolutely the same ingredients as good old Head&amp;SHoulders. Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t feel much of difference using this product. Bought it for itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> Considering that our scalps become immune to shampoos it is wise to have a variety of medicated shampoos on hand for that dreadful time you absolutely need one. This is my newest addition to my just-in-case shower shelf.</li>
            <li> Shampoo did nothing for my dandruff. I&#x27;m African American so I only wash my hair once a week, and it wasn&#x27;t strong enough to stave off the dandruff for that long a period of time. I&#x27;d recommend for those who wash their hair daily to every couple of days, but not weekly. I recently switched to weekly tea rinses and glycolix shampoo and not only has this process stopped the hairfall, but my dandruff is slowly disappearing. I must note that I was recently diagnosed with seb-psoriasis by my dermatologist who recommended the glycolix shampoo.</li>
            <li> Let me start with a general warning for all amazon customers looking for a dandruff fighting shampoo: they don&#x27;t work. If you want to fight dandruff take cold showers instead of hot, stop using hair gel, and (believe it or not) use Vaseline to groom your hair (even if it brings Grease flash backs). I have tried them all and they don&#x27;t work. Save your money.</li>
            <li> My father&#x27;s doctor recommended Zincon many years ago and it worked very well for him.  When I got older and developed the same problem, I knew exactly which shampoo to turn to.  I&#x27;ve tried Head &amp; Shoulders and a few other products, but they really did not help me.  Zincon is great for everyday use and completely gets rid of my dandruff and itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Head and Shoulders, basically.  Meh.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a specific brand of dandruff shampoo but Amazon Rep. recommended this product when it arrived my daughter began using the product and it worked just as well as the other shampoo if not better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank You Amazon Rep for your recommendations!</li>
            <li> So far after a month or so of use it has only slightly lessened the dandruff (and only with near-constant upkeep). It may work better/worse for other people however.</li>
            <li> I am all the time satisfied with Amazon&#x27;s service! I had to purchase this item two times, cuz I lost my package last time. But it&#x27;s not Amazon&#x27;s fault. After I moved to new apartment, the UPS guy put my package without any notice (even not knock the door.), so I lost my packages two times already. However, Amazon was willing to replace my order and I finally got this item today! I used this only one time, but so far, seems great.. I wish that it really works.</li>
            <li> Works for me. I have been using it for decades.</li>
            <li> I had been using another product for my husband and I&#x27;s dandruff problem, and could no longer find it in stores. Looked online and price was Crazy High! Even on Amazon. So I looked for something else, this had great reviews... and I see why. It works amazingly. We&#x27;ll continue to purchase through amazon too!</li>
            <li> I have used Zincon shampoo for years after a dermatologist recommended it.  I no longer can find it in drugstores so I&#x27;m extremely happy to be able to get it through Amazon.  It&#x27;s wonderful for keeping dandruff in check and leaves a fresh clean smell to the hair.  My order was fulfilled quickly and efficiently and, best of all, I received free shipping because I had enough items in my order to qualify.</li>
            <li> Deliver of this was very, very quick.  My scalps feels so much better and less itching since using this product twice already.  I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> My husband loves the shampoo. No more itching and flaking.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for over 20 years. It&#x27;s a great daily general shampoo. I just wish I could find it locally.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for 20 years.  No medicine-y smell.  Nice and foamy.  Lathers great and really works the best on dandruff and scalp.  Bonus:  Hair is soft and managable as is this was a &amp;#34;pricey&amp;#34; salon product.</li>
            <li> I think this is a bit overpriced. I can get the same product at the dollar store with the same ingredients for a lot less money</li>
            <li> ITS BETTER THAN I SPEC</li>
            <li> Bought product as alternative to ones normally use. Works pretty good. My dandruff has decreased. I alternate between products every other day but they were starting to lose effectiveness so wanted a different one. Will update review if any updates.</li>
            <li> At first I thought this shampoo didn&#x27;t work. My results were the same as other dandruff shampoos. But then I read a review, that mentioned rinse and repeat like the instructions say. So I used the rinse and repeat method and after a few days all of my flakes were gone. Seriously. This is revolutionary for me. I&#x27;ve been living with flakes almost my whole life and finding ways to cover them up, but now I finally found a way to get rid of them. I just got through my first bottle and now I&#x27;m buying two more to stock up. A great product.</li>
            <li> Zincon Dandruff Shampoo is without a doubt the best shampoo available in the consumer market. I am most grateful it continues to be manufactured, and available to the general public through Amazon. This is particularly significant since it appears that it is no longer available for sale in any retail stores. Thank you, Amazon.</li>
            <li> Our dermatologist has recommended this shampoo and my daughter and I have used it for years. It is the best for our scalp and hair!</li>
            <li> This shampoo was recommended to me - and it is working well for me as I use it twice weekly.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Works very well and I recommend. This can be used daily. No fragrence noticed. I like it.</li>
            <li> I have used this for many years. It is great for dry itchy scalp. It also leaves your hair soft.</li>
            <li> I used to like this shampoo, the formula must have changed in recent years as it even smells different.&lt;br /&gt;It burned my scalp and made my hair shed more than usual. I made sure to follow directions, but the irritation it causes is just too much. It DOES clear dandruff, but what good is that if it causes damage to my scalp?........</li>
            <li> The original, and still the best formula.</li>
            <li> Zincon shampoo is a very good product. It helped to relieve my dry scalp.  It worked much better than the Head &amp; Shoulders I previously used.</li>
            <li> After raving about Nizoral a few months back, I was very disappointed to learn about the sky rocketing prices of the product now. Something to do with shortage of production? I don&#x27;t know, but sellers are definitely price gouging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I was doing research and this product kept coming up. The reviews were great so I decided to give a try.&lt;br /&gt;I am so glad I did! First of all, can we talk about the price? I am so used to paying $12-$24+ for dandruff shampoo that $10 seems like nothing. Especially if it is going to fix the problem. After 1 wash my hair was noticably dandruff free. I had scales of dandruff and I believe mine is extremely severe and GROSS. I have had dandruff problems for YEARS and this is the first time that my hair felt really clean at the end of the day. No dandruff at all. I am sooo pleased and will be buying tons more on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was perfect by the way.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s saved (me) a 83 year old from baldness from 1978 to present. If you think you are losing hair while you are young, better try it. My brothers are balding or losing precious hair by not trying it. Would recommend highly!&lt;br /&gt;Roger&lt;br /&gt;Nebraska</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my purchase of Zincon. It does the job, and leaves my hair shiny, soft and manageable...unusual for a therapeutic shampoo! Good seller, and quick shipping. Will order again.</li>
            <li> I really love this shampoo. My hair is clean dandruff free and it smells great. I would definitely buy again and again.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years; but is not easy to find! As stated above, it has mostly arrested my mild hair loss, due to the zinc content and deep cleansing ability that dissolves the DHT, that is one of primary culprits of male hair loss!  It is somewhat drying, so good moisturizing conditioner needed!</li>
            <li> I have been plagued with some type of scalp irritation for years. My scalp flares up at times and develops red scaly patches that flake, yuck! I have tried literally every OTC brand of shampoos for every type of scalp condition out there and most made it worse. I have been to the dermatologist and tried prescription strength shampoos, and that didn&#x27;t help either. I had almost given up and did one last look on Amazon for the &amp;#34;one&amp;#34;. This is it! I don&#x27;t use it every day, and I don&#x27;t use it on my entire head ( I have long, thick hair). I use it on the areas that need it along with my regular shampoo and my scalp is almost normal. It didn&#x27;t work great at first, until I finally started washing with it twice as the directions said. Great product.</li>
