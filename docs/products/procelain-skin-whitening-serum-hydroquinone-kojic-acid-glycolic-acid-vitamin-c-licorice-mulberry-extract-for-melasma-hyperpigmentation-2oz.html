            <li>Make sure you use a very good sunscreen when you use Porcelain.</li>
            <li>it came in the box in good condition no damage or anything.</li>
            <li>I tried to be fair</li>
            <li>Product is doing a good job with fading of sun spots on my face.</li>
            <li>I thought this product is good to keep around.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>I bought this based on the good review.</li>
            <li>I am delighted with this product.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>it sounds really good</li>
            <li>To be fair, I have not tried this product yet.</li>
            <li>Yes, there will be some flaking of your skin but honestly, it&#x27;s nothing I haven&#x27;t experienced before.</li>
            <li>i haven&#x27;t seen any changes,and therefore i am not going to give it a good review..</li>
            <li>I also felt secure in ordering the product because of the return policy they had, awesome.  </li>
            <li>Good product for the money</li>
            <li>This wasn&#x27;t a good look as my face is my business.</li>
            <li>I purchased this Murad skin whitening serum after seeing it recommended by Good Housekeeping magazine.</li>
            <li>This did not work as good as the kojic soap bar did</li>
            <li>It does a good job at removing what it&#x27;s supposed</li>
            <li>Its worthy it, you have to have a great soap as well!</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>I am so happy that this product has worked for me :)</li>
            <li>I am so happy that this product has worked for me :)</li>
            <li>It is not harsh to the skin, absorbs readily, great under makeup, and best of all works!</li>
            <li>This is remarkable for me as I tend to react to everything but the most hypo-allergenic products.  </li>
            <li>You have to be patient to see results and with continuous use you will be just as satisfied as I am!</li>
            <li>I was so pleased with this product!</li>
            <li>And pain on top of it! *</li>
            <li>Love this product!  </li>
            <li>Hello All, I have to say I love this product!</li>
            <li>So, after years of trying tons of products to figure out the perfect blend, I thought I&#x27;d also include my exact regiment in case you are feeling helpless and like nothing will work to make you feel</li>
            <li>I absolutley love this!</li>
            <li>After using this product for about 2 weeks, most of the spots already appear lighter!</li>
            <li>and she looks better than ever!</li>
            <li>This stuff feels great on my skin, has no odor, and gives quick results!  </li>
            <li>I  noticed my skin is more bright , even and glowing just couple days using this product.</li>
            <li>but it is amazing how well the brown is disappearing</li>
            <li>I was worried about taking a risk on this  over the counter product, however, the results were amazing.</li>
            <li>My skin looks amazing.</li>
            <li>... and if it does, I hope it&#x27;s the treatable kind because I don&#x27;t plan on stopping.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was excellent and very timely.</li>
            <li>Love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried IPL and had a good peel.</li>
            <li>nice brightening serum.</li>
            <li>I took care of the burnt spots with Neosporin‎ and it healed/peeled nicely.</li>
            <li>honestly I think I not from a knock off company.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe something this inexpensive could be so effective.</li>
            <li>&amp; I can honestly tell you that this product works.</li>
            <li>I was kind of hesitant to buy it because of the name.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m already a goodlooking attractive female but that glow, makes my skin look flawless.</li>
            <li>Honestly, this price for a 2 oz.</li>
            <li>I was so thrilled.</li>
            <li>SOO EFFECTIVELY</li>
            <li>I have to be honest.</li>
            <li>:) :) now warning: there is a bit of discomfort, I experienced redness and burning but it is tolerable.</li>
            <li>e visible aspect of it, now the hormonal is another aspect on its own)  </li>
            <li>so here I was on Amazon searching for a cheaper alternative that is effective..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll order another to keep handy...</li>
            <li>I have been using this cream almost two week for my discoloration on my skin (medium skin tone and 30 age) but honestly i haven&#x27;t seen any difference</li>
            <li>Seller was very nice and gave me a hassle free refund.</li>
            <li>Certainly worth the results in my mind!!!</li>
            <li>I have an olive skin tone which scars very easily.</li>
            <li>but it has made me more confident!</li>
            <li>I got results in two days, my skin just keeps getting better and better!</li>
            <li>When I have had dryness or peeling, I make sure to exfoliate.&lt;br /&gt;Really really pleased!</li>
            <li>Love love!</li>
            <li>Amazing magic serum works</li>
            <li>Thank you for creating this amazing stuff it saved me :)</li>
            <li>I rarely review products but am so happy this one has worked for me.</li>
            <li>This gel is the best for a clear skin.</li>
            <li>My mom bought this and so far it has worked great!</li>
            <li>The chemical is so strong !</li>
            <li>, i was so excited to get this after reading all the good reviews about this cream</li>
            <li>MY SKIN IS LOOKING GREAT FOR THE FIRST TIME IN YEARS.</li>
            <li>spots on my hand is all gone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: the container is very cheap.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin very smooth though.</li>
            <li>have very fair, sensitive, and acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li>before I say I love it.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I found this product.  </li>
            <li>and I love the way the gel disappears after the application...</li>
            <li>Ok, now onto the product.</li>
            <li>It is ok.</li>
            <li>Four weeks after peeling from the IPL treatment, the area had the most peel also turned the most pigmented.</li>
            <li>Love this serum.</li>
            <li>really love this product.</li>
            <li>Many spots.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t give many reviews for products I buy</li>
            <li>After many years of the search for the product that works, I found it.</li>
            <li>My skin does feel smoother and maybe with more time I will see improved results.  </li>
            <li>Also, you must make sure you keep the area moisturized because it will tend to look like snake skin after use if not keep moisturized.</li>
            <li>kids love this.</li>
            <li>I mostly cook vegan dishes now and try to stay away from all dairy and meat.</li>
            <li>My skin defiantly changed for the better after two uses.</li>
            <li>Then I tried it more offten that your suppose to and it burned my skin.</li>
            <li>and my melasma looks so much better.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if this would work or not</li>
            <li>You&#x27;d love results in the morning.</li>
            <li>Just burned a lot more then anything.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, its a okay product.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>My skin tone seems more even</li>
            <li>but I feel like this porcelain skin serum had the most to do with it..</li>
            <li>I would love to return this product if I could.</li>
            <li>I love, love this product and the price.</li>
            <li>I jus love this product..</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>me tell you, I wouldn&#x27;t take the time to sit here and write a review about something that hasn&#x27;t made me very happy unless I really felt that the product is worth it.  </li>
            <li>this product has given me confidence in my face again!  :)</li>
            <li>Once summer is over, I am confident that I will have even more resolution.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>&amp; I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll see more in time.  </li>
            <li>May need to order more see what happens, so would purchase again.</li>
            <li>My husband says the lip browning is much better, I no longer look like I need to shave.</li>
            <li>LOVE this product, it worked wonders on my skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s even more noticeable to others than  a mirror state for yourself..</li>
            <li>Love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>you are just peeling your face over and over again which I cannot imagine it is healthy for your skin.</li>
            <li>The results have not been magical or miraculous.</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>does cause redness and peeling, but I started using moisturizer with vitamin C on top of this Porcelain Skin Whitening Serum and it has helped.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But here&#x27;s hoping it will also end up lightening things as well :)</li>
            <li>Ascorbate: vitamin C that&#x27;s been modified to be more lipid soluble to allow it to better penetrate skin</li>
            <li>For 30.00 this is way better in price n</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many products but never saw any difference.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I did.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this product :)</li>
            <li>I am so pleased with the feel of my skin and the brown spots are disappearing.</li>
            <li>this serum peeled my face really good.im happy with the product.</li>
            <li>To avoid itching and get better skin cleansing results, I will be using microfiber face cloths.</li>
            <li>I am glad, I did.</li>
            <li>I did not want to lighten my skin, I just wanted a more even complexion.</li>
            <li>I will continue using it for a couple more weeks.</li>
            <li>I did try laser treatment a year or so ago, which did give even better results.</li>
            <li>http://www.amazon.com/Np-Set-Concealer-Look-0-5-ounce/dp/B002LDUSOM/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1371611979&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;np+set+concealer&lt;br /&gt;4 - Brush on appropriate shade of M.A.C. Face and Body Foundation.</li>
            <li>am satisfied with this product</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t blame the serum, because my skin has been discolored for many years.  </li>
            <li>I will be ordering more when this one runs out.</li>
            <li>OK, I hear people saying, &amp;#34;Oh</li>
            <li>They are much better with in the 3 week of using it so</li>
            <li>I got his like dime size mark on the top of my foot.</li>
            <li>can say now I am feeling better ,</li>
            <li>it be good if i continue using even i have already obtain a good clear translucent skin?  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Thank you and appreciate your precious advice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regards&lt;br /&gt;Chelsa</li>
            <li>At this rate, within another week, I&amp;#34;ll be able to get away with using just a bronzer.</li>
            <li>I love, love, love this product.</li>
            <li>My skin looks so much better now.</li>
            <li>Just go with something light and have lots of patience to allow your skin to repair on its own</li>
            <li>so it may work better for Caucasian skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it at night and an spf 110 from Neutrogena during the day to be sure they stay gone.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not using it to whiten my skin but to create a healthy glow, which this serum does for me.  </li>
            <li>AND I LOVE</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ordering more.</li>
            <li>I need more time to see the lightening effects.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got all the top ingrediants,so</li>
            <li>Am so glad I did because it has cleared up my cheeks...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Upated on 13 july 2013&lt;br /&gt; Its been more than a month i havent seen any difference at all by using this cream and also bit upset becuz</li>
            <li>family has remarked at how much better my face looks.  </li>
            <li>&quot; I&#x27;ve tried everything else and thought I would try one more thing before spending the money on a dermatologist.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t say it&#x27;s a skin whitening product, it&#x27;s more of skin brightening and lightening.</li>
            <li>My face is also brighter and more even looking, and my acne is gone.</li>
            <li>hahahaha!!!! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>Very exciting!</li>
            <li>But so far, so good!</li>
            <li>Pretty good for melasma</li>
            <li>My skin was look pretty good and lighting</li>
            <li>Best skin whitening serum I&#x27;ve used in really long time</li>
            <li>In 2 weeks i saw significant results, and on the 3rd week I am very impressed.</li>
            <li>plus it&#x27;s a day time moisturizer with beautiful ingredients that you can pronounce and eat many of them, big</li>
            <li>My skin after a week looks smooth, more even, and prettier than before I began using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I took that as a free consultation :).</li>
            <li>Some of them are good size and very visible</li>
            <li>This lightener is a good product, it seems to be working really well for me.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product!</li>
            <li>I have found that the Sephora Brush #56 does a great job at applying the foundation, keeping it light, well blended, and natural looking.</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t push it so easy and always splash on my hand.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am really happy with this product, but hope when I have to order my next bottle the pump will work better.</li>
            <li>The consistency is easy to spread over skin and isn&#x27;t sticky or greasy.</li>
            <li>However it is not as strong as a peel or a spa treatment but for those of us on a budget it works.</li>
            <li>She said to use it once a day because it&#x27;s so strong and after three weeks use it twice a day.</li>
            <li>Do not perform any glycolic peels or strong skin treatments during the treatment.</li>
            <li>This is some Strong stuff use with coution.</li>
            <li>If you have struggled with blemishes, I would strongly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>It causes some peeling, so it&#x27;s like a chemical peel in that sense but not as strong.  </li>
            <li>Honestly, I was sold after the first use.</li>
            <li>I opted not to and instead researched the best way to remove dark spots.</li>
            <li>far it seems to be working great as I have seen lightening of some acne spots , the true test will be the lightening of my melasma spots&lt;br /&gt;note</li>
            <li>You are absolutely fine exposing yourself to sunlight after the product and this does not affect you.</li>
            <li>Quick results!  </li>
            <li>Great, it is good product seems to be lightening the dark spot, my skin was breakout , it is really working well for me for me, i need more time to see the lightening</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is very important to use sunscreen all the time when you are out in the sun, or the spots will come right back.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I already see a huge improvement in my melasma and sun spots.</li>
            <li>I can see a huge difference in my cheek area and</li>
            <li>Amazing, highly recommended for African-American skin!</li>
            <li>But its worth it. :)</li>
            <li>Overall happy.</li>
            <li>To be honest, I wasn&#x27;t expecting much because of the price--In the spa, products of this nature often cost over $100.00.</li>
            <li>Smooth deal.</li>
            <li>Acid: skin lightener &amp; antioxidant; reduces production of melanin; deteriorates in air &amp; light</li>
            <li>I bought the MD oil free sunscreen together with this product.</li>
            <li>but overall not all that happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>- Apply Aquaphor advanced healing moisturizer over any parts of the face that are dry:&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so light</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m Latina w light tan skin.</li>
            <li>It also leaves your skin feeling smooth.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so smooth.</li>
            <li>Redness and light peeling may occur.</li>
            <li>I also am giving it five stars for fast shipping and for it being a nice sized bottle.</li>
            <li>Seems really important to keep out of the sun at this point…  </li>
            <li>Plus shipping is free.  </li>
            <li>After 35 years of buying nearly every available product out in the market, I must say that this one is by far the best!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so light and the effects are almost immediate.&lt;br</li>
            <li>MY FACE IS REALLY SMOOTH WITH THIS.</li>
            <li>Effective yet gentle.</li>
            <li>I have NOT noticed any change in my brown spots on my face - using good old cheap lemon juice</li>
            <li>So far the Product show good  result</li>
            <li>So far so good...</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s active ingredients it makes it sound very good and convinces you that it will work</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it every other night for about 6 weeks and have seen an incredible improvement in my complexion.</li>
            <li>Although I&#x27;ll never have pristine, smooth skin, this has made a significant difference in my appearance.</li>
            <li>When the bottle is gone I will definitely reorder, which is the greatest testament.is considered as normal.</li>
            <li>SIGNIFICANTLY.  </li>
            <li>kept using this products 2 more weeks after the first review.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m consistently amazed at people who expect a product to work like magic.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try it..  </li>
            <li>As a long time sufferer of Melasma I have great hopes for this product.</li>
            <li>very good peouct for those who wana remove black spotting from face.</li>
            <li>yeaaa clean skin at last.worth it.</li>
            <li>I apply to a clean face with a cotton ball where the melisma (brown spots) are at night.  </li>
            <li>I followed the directions and applied this product on clean face at night</li>
            <li>I have experienced red and peeling skin, however it is worth it.</li>
            <li>I decided to purchase this items after checking many positive reviews.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I decided to give this a try based on the many positive reviews....</li>
            <li>I would buy it again because it clearly helped me feel and look better!</li>
            <li>The sunscreen must MUST contain zinc oxide or titanium dioxide for it to be effective on melasma, any old sunscreen will not work!  </li>
            <li>But if you are like me, with healthy and good skin condition other then some blemishes, this will do the job.</li>
            <li>This may be a special case, but if I were you</li>
            <li>Specially on my cheeks....</li>
            <li>I am Asian, south east Asia, my skin is tan, I want to have bright tan face.</li>
            <li>This is my first Amazon review, I decided that this product was worth reviewing :)</li>
            <li>but it is the true.</li>
            <li>Have been using for more than a month a don&#x27;t really see any lightening of my sunspots.</li>
            <li>This product really works as many others have stated.</li>
            <li>I have malasma and have tried using almost about everything to lighten it and about 2 yrs ago, I tried n paid for a full IPL photo</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never heard of this brand but the reviews were good enough for me to try it.</li>
            <li>Good results, my fourth bottle</li>
            <li>I use fair and white lotion for my body.</li>
            <li>With summer being in full swing, I&#x27;m taking a break from use.</li>
            <li>--now I don&amp;#34;t need too much makeup because my skin tone is more even.</li>
            <li>FAR IAM LOVING</li>
            <li>SHIPPPPING WAS REALLY FAST ALSO SO ANOTHER 5 STARS TO THAT :)</li>
            <li>The skin on my ears did peel (not badly)</li>
            <li>and before it was really not bad</li>
            <li>figured I would give it a try and the price was not bad.</li>
            <li>Product came quickly with great informative paperwork that I read carefully.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m brown skinned too, and the resulting pigmentation is pretty strong.  </li>
            <li>Seriously, one of the BEST decisions I&#x27;ve ever made!</li>
            <li>am so super grateful for this product</li>
            <li>But quickly plateaus.</li>
            <li>but it helped mildly.  </li>
            <li>Quick delivery, I&#x27;m using the produce at night, have seem some results</li>
            <li>I did peel initially, but it was great because firstly, my whole face did not peel at once.</li>
            <li>Also some of the ingredient is carcinogenic so assess the product and ask yourself if you&#x27;re feelin lucky.</li>
            <li>It is an investment that is worth so much to me in the confidence I am able to exude because my skin looks evenly toned</li>
            <li>Quick turn around.  </li>
            <li>I think people with mild  discoloration may be helped.</li>
            <li>I use many high end skin moisturizers and anti-aging stuff.</li>
            <li>My first night using it (Fri nite), I felt it stinging, but  I just tapped lightly on the spots I put it on, and the mild pain subsided.  </li>
            <li>My skin is still nowhere near perfect, but I certainly see a little more improvement after each use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, my face was bk to normal even better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s important to note to consumers who may not be aware of how hyperpigmentation works, you must must must wear sunscreen every day during and after the fading process.</li>
            <li>bottle of product with these ingredients is pretty fabulous.</li>
            <li>so I am taking the time to write a review because it is very much deserved for this product!  </li>
            <li>I am using less concealer each day and am happy with the results.</li>
            <li>I am so glad all of you has shared the feedback and because of your feedback, I am willing to try this reasonable price product.</li>
            <li>within the first week of use I began to peel, the darkened areas around my cheek literally began to peel!</li>
            <li>I really hope it&#x27;s working!!</li>
            <li>My skin looked overall nice where I applied it, so now I kind of sweep a bit all over, to even skintone in general.</li>
            <li>Stay away from the sun while using and even hot yoga is not goood!</li>
            <li>I really see the change in the spots!!</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference in my skin within the first week!</li>
            <li>and i&#x27;m ready for work looking absolutly fine.</li>
            <li>It applies smooth and dries fast.</li>
            <li>This product is fantastic as well as reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>However if this product is going to work it would have worked on its own, another month later still no change what so ever.</li>
            <li>Thought it was worth a try</li>
            <li>This product is worth the buck.</li>
            <li>Is it worth it?  </li>
            <li>but I took a chance and purchased it thinking it would be worth it if it worked.</li>
            <li>I would love to buy it by the quart for my arms and legs that are getting old and blotchy.  </li>
            <li>what it is worth</li>
            <li>I wanted to try a product that had more natural ingredients in it.  </li>
            <li>Better than the px topical antibiotics I use, better than retin a,  better than benzyol peroxide cream in my current arsenal!  </li>
            <li>I have been struggling to lighten the areas for 2 yrs now without success and it hasn&#x27;t went away.  </li>
            <li>I definitley plan on purchasing another bottle, it was worth the investment.</li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t bother to write reviews but after seeing the great positive result am experiencing, I wanted to share it, in case someone is going through the same skin discoloration I was going through.</li>
            <li>I have used other hydroquinone products without great results, but the description of this product sounded promising,  so I ordered it.</li>
            <li>The price was right</li>
            <li>By using it for couple of days, I noticed the difference right away.  </li>
            <li>I am seeing the result right now..</li>
            <li>I had a reaction from my birth control that gave me melasma right before my wedding.</li>
            <li>Absorbs right into the skin.</li>
            <li>I have been a looking for the right product to get rid of my acne scars the issue with that</li>
            <li>This is great for wrinkles, hyperpigmentation, scars, and so many other things because it reveals new skin completely.</li>
            <li>, it was more of a mild to moderate case of Melasma</li>
            <li>This was okay at controlling acne but barely did anything to lighten acne scars.  </li>
            <li>The top layer of my skin started peeling after the very first use and I saw result it looked like what&#x27;s left after a snake shred</li>
            <li>/&gt;Really great product and in the future I will definitely purchase this again!</li>
            <li>I was waiting on the edge of my seat to receive this &amp; it was delivered in such a FAST time frame that was amazing on its own!&lt;br /&gt;Second-</li>
            <li>I expect that after a few more weeks I will not be able to see it at all.</li>
            <li>I used to put full coverage makeup on (dermablend) on and would still be able to see a grey mustache and cheeks...</li>
            <li>It is really working quickly on this area.</li>
            <li>Great results for severe melasma after only 6 weeks of daily use!</li>
            <li>This product really works if you have dark  spots on your face, you must purchase this as soon as possible - it&#x27;s a miracle &amp; excellent price,</li>
            <li>After trying so many different products I found Porcelain Skin Whitening Serum to work not only effectively but also fast.</li>
            <li>and it costs too much, this product works fast and the price is worth every penny for me because it works!  </li>
            <li>The only warning I would have is that this product is strong and works quickly.  </li>
            <li>am now on my FOURTH night of using it &amp; have ALREADY SAW A HUGE DIFFERENCE!</li>
            <li>first two weeks</li>
            <li>It is a lot easier to see your dermatologist and get an rX for the hydroquinone in a higher percentage to treat the melasma.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m beginning to wonder if many of the reviews were posted by the company selling the product rather than actually consumers.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different products for my melasma.</li>
            <li>, i am using it exactly like the instruction says.</li>
            <li>Yeeeeeees, I found the product that really works!</li>
            <li>so I ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;FIRST-Super fast ship!</li>
            <li>Today was the first day I put make up on</li>
            <li>The product label looked a bit funny.</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t use any face creams or washes ( just hot water and cetephil once a day) and started using M.A.C. makeup- the powder as concealer.</li>
            <li>so I am aware of the ingredients and how they affect the skin.</li>
            <li>Gently pat it into your face until absorbed.</li>
            <li>The product actually burnt me; however, I received a refund. :)</li>
            <li>first week there was a bit of stinging, and redness, but never any peeling.</li>
            <li>First of all, when I ordered it, it said it would take a week for delivery.  </li>
            <li>but Im hesitant to spend any more on the same product with inconsistent results.</li>
            <li>so when I first used this it did burn/peel parts of my face.</li>
            <li>like I was after the first treatment.</li>
            <li>I am 2/3 through my first bottle that I bought 2 months ago</li>
            <li>and I am back to buy more.</li>
            <li>Absolutely nothing!</li>
            <li>Within the first week I saw a difference.</li>
            <li>At first it seemed to have gotten darker</li>
            <li>n noticed a difference within the first week.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I finally found something that works.</li>
            <li>I have pretty severe Melasma on my face.</li>
            <li>I will definitely order this again as this is the most improvement I&#x27;ve seen from any product I&#x27;ve tried for Melasma.</li>
            <li>Took pictures on my first day and compared it to show my friends.</li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s okay,</li>
            <li>The first night I used it I woke up and noticed some peeling.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone instead of the the expensive perscription drugs that dont offer this good of result!!</li>
            <li>Applied it on the first night.</li>
            <li>Will start using it in the fall when it&#x27;s not as hot or humid.</li>
            <li>The first night I used it</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;m going to try this again when my skin clears up because I really want it to work!</li>
            <li>THIS IS THE FIRST PRODUCT THAT EVER HELP WITH MY MALASMA.  </li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>then I just apply for one night and I am back to norm again :).  </li>
            <li>I think you have to be consistent to have it work.</li>
            <li>MY FIRST EXPERIENCE WITH HYDROQUINONE</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been 10 days to be exact since I started using the product</li>
            <li>Each cost $100 a piece and is not guaranteed to work (Her exact words)</li>
            <li>I need a higher dosage since I got the lowest?</li>
            <li>but I noticed the skin is much softer !</li>
            <li>I saw results within the first week of use.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say i began to see a difference after the first week.</li>
            <li>I can swear to confirm that i do see good results of whitening of my melsama and uneven skintone.  </li>
            <li>Mild peeling, not much redness or irritation but all of that is better than the brown spots.</li>
            <li>I have a very sensitive skin and during all treatment every night my skin got red and kind of hitching for 20 min</li>
            <li>Over the years, I went from one product to another, I spent so much money consulting with dermatologist, I went to Spas and did so many facials all to no avail!</li>
            <li>It has not gotten rid of all of it completely, but it has made a significant difference.</li>
            <li>I am not only using this product I wash my face with fair and white (AHA orange box), take glutathione 1500 mg (by Ivory caps) and this stuff.</li>
            <li>First off let me tell you what nationalities I am and what color and type of skin I have, because that does make a difference when looking for certain skin care products.</li>
            <li>After reading all the positive reviews, I thought I should give it a try.</li>
            <li>I purchased this based on positive reviews-  and have been using it for 5 days approx.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used so many products that I&#x27;ve purchased at top stores such as Sephora and spent over $100s of dollars on name brands, in which they didn&#x27;t work!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thank you so much, and I really thank Jesus Who I prayed to for helping to find this product!</li>
            <li>Look up the strange chemical names,, if there are too many, forget it.</li>
            <li>I use this every morning and night, and it was very stingy at first, so I combined it with a whitening lotion (the one that has both day and night formulas)</li>
            <li>Against my better judgement, I tried it, and after a few days, I started noticing significant lightening.</li>
            <li>My daughter and I want products that work within a small amount of time and do a good job.  </li>
            <li>I am not sure if I would have as good results without the combination of the 2 products.</li>
            <li>but it is still early to  give full judgment.</li>
            <li>The process takes time but you will definitely notice a cleaner more high lighted skin tone</li>
            <li>Make sure to wash off before you go outside and don&#x27;t put tons on you can get dry skin, other then that this is the best cream ever with actual results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been able to abandon my normal regimen of tea tree oil + acne control moisturizer (Yonka 15 Creme) and simply use this at night.</li>
            <li>I have dry skin so most things make me peel.</li>
            <li>But my results were pretty fantastic for a topical product.</li>
            <li>I am feeling much better now, I am trying to minimize sun exposure and religiously I am applying It once a  day (normally at night before  go to bed).</li>
            <li>It will make  your face red in areas with no discoloration, so it is strong, but it seems to work.</li>
            <li>It did cause the treated area to peel(it&#x27;s supposed to), but it was not excessively harsh, it was kind of like the peeling that happens after a minor sun burn.</li>
            <li>Your skin will peel in certain areas but I just exfoliated my face to get rid of that.</li>
            <li>4% pure Hydroquinone on it before as prescribed by my dermatologist.</li>
            <li>I give this product 5 stars for effectively lightening 50% of dark hyper-pigmentation on elbows in 2 weeks!</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, it really boost whitening.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I absolutely recommend this product, my melasma went away</li>
            <li>/&gt;3.evoid sun as much as you can while using</li>
            <li>Very helpful for sunspots or discoloration.  </li>
            <li>the product is working very well after two weeks of using it...</li>
            <li>do not notice much change in pigmentation after weeks of use.</li>
            <li>I applied the light serum twice daily...</li>
            <li>I really appreciate dis product.</li>
            <li>This Porcelain serum really works wonder on my face.  </li>
            <li>They are gradually disappearing and I&#x27;m very content that there&#x27;s progress.</li>
            <li>I used according to instructions for 6 weeks on hands and face and there was absolutely change.  </li>
            <li>but my real rate is 0.</li>
            <li>I really want to warn those of you who are considering IPL.</li>
            <li>and it really does work</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t need so much.</li>
            <li>This product is really working well.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I became very depressed and began to look for solution.</li>
            <li>I read all the product information &amp; before going to bed that night I used it, honestly I really had no</li>
            <li>I experienced pretty heavy peeling of the area to which I applied the serum, maybe because it&#x27;s on the lip, but that&#x27;s a relatively minor side effect.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works.</li>
            <li>Get an app for your phone for cosmetic ingredients, very useful.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Guys/Girls it really works and is not irritating.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t expect much from a non-prescription product, but this stuff really works.</li>
            <li>After spending so much money on dermatologist for 1 1/2 years.  </li>
            <li>and I was in so much pain.</li>
            <li>It did cause my skin to peel in the areas I applied it to but haven&#x27;t noticed the area lightening much.</li>
            <li>I was amazed at how well and fast</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend this product!</li>
            <li>When the spots started getting darker even with sunscreen I started researching around and found the reviews for this product very helpful.  </li>
            <li>I tried the whole bottle, produced irritation, itching and darkened my skin.</li>
            <li>This has been happening over a two week period and I have now stopped peeling and my skin is very visibly brighter, whiter and</li>
            <li>/&gt;Additionally, I must say, my face feels much lighter and smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not break out.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to make this a 5 star and</li>
            <li>I have melasma on on my face that looks like slightly red speckles or light smudges of dirt.</li>
            <li>So far, it was worth the money.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t see much result</li>
            <li>I use it every day and have never broken out.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even put that much on.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also helped on a light brown area above my chin.</li>
            <li>This product didn&#x27;t really do much for me.</li>
            <li>This is working very well for me.</li>
            <li>now I haven&#x27;t really noticed any changes to my skin.</li>
            <li>i gotten from too much sun exposure.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t really care.</li>
            <li>I have not broken out from the product.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t believe how fast the delivery was.</li>
            <li>I was really hoping this product lived up to its lclaims</li>
            <li>I really do like this product and you should go out there and buy one.</li>
            <li>very well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>works very well.</li>
            <li>It did absolutely nothing for my condition.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely incredible!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it  was really uncomfy as I have feeling of burning on my skin</li>
            <li>I really can see the difference.</li>
            <li>and it really works.  </li>
            <li>After a month 95% of spots not visible and unless you are looking very closely the spots on my hands are gone.</li>
            <li>thank you very much.&lt;br</li>
            <li>the products i&#x27;ve purchased in the past (too many to name) barely gave me any satisfying results.</li>
            <li>I dont even have to wear as much foundatin anymore.</li>
            <li>and I really put a lot over my melasma</li>
            <li>I really feel that I need to let others know how well this worked for me.</li>
            <li>The skin started to peel revealing a much newer, lighter skin.</li>
            <li>It really looked like I had hair there</li>
            <li>My melasma has lightened so much that you can NOT tell I had a sun mustache, so happy!!&lt;br /&gt;Date</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m amazed to say, it really works.  </li>
            <li>fast delivery</li>
            <li>In search of looking for something that would truly deliver what it promise and doing my homework online, making sure the ingredients are natural as possible and recommend this product 100%, it had worked for me and I will continue to order.</li>
            <li>I am near 40 with fair skin, and I am blonde, with blonde eyebrows.</li>
            <li>Its alright, but I liked this stuff I got a few months ago.</li>
            <li>you want instant, safe, and professional results go to the doctor.</li>
            <li>During and immediately following my pregnancy they became very distinct.</li>
            <li>For hydroquinone serum, if you have not reached desired results after first treatment, allow a week of rest before initiating new treatment.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The amount of serum for the price is good, compared to other similar products.</li>
            <li>In the past I used products like hydroquinone ranging from 6% to 12%, AHA, and BHA and using these products alone or together was a disaster and caused even more damage!</li>
            <li>I know you&#x27;ve probably heard it a million times, but sunscreen is crucial to skin health, ESPECIALLY if you&#x27;re using a product as strong as this one!</li>
            <li>If my new skin is pink, then I skip a day to allow more healing.</li>
            <li>I have a slight case of melasma and with this cream I&#x27;ve been able to really keep it under control.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The most important reason I&#x27;m giving it 5 stars at this point is because the product does not break out my skin at all (which I&#x27;ve had a problem with in all the other skin lightening formulations I&#x27;ve tried) nor does it dry my skin out or cause irritation.</li>
            <li>this is amazing and i am not sure if this serum should get all the credit or not.</li>
            <li>The serum made mi dark spots darker and now they look more notecible.</li>
            <li>After another 5 days of using the product, most dark spots started to fade.</li>
            <li>the initial peeling I had in the first 5 to 7 days is pretty much gone.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think I just waited money on, yey, another product that didn&#x27;t live up to it&#x27;s claim!</li>
            <li>(I didn&#x27;t have a more recent clear pic, mostly because I&#x27;ve been hiding from the camera the past four years).</li>
            <li>Mild redness is also expected as the normal skin renewing process, as the active ingredients are effectively penetrating into the deeper layers of the skin and targeting skin discoloration to its core.</li>
            <li>My cheek looked awesome two weeks later, but literally a month later, the dark spot came back! ...</li>
            <li>and I used up more than half a bottle, hoping that it will eventually work.</li>
            <li>Decent product considering the price.</li>
            <li>I used this product on a particularly stubborn sun spot that I&#x27;ve had on my cheek for years.  </li>
            <li>The only thing I am noticing is that I am experiencing some dryness, redness and peeling while using the product, so I am giving my skin a few days break and using a good moisturizer to let it heal then</li>
            <li>It works, slowly but surely!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Procelain since the last week of June, and have found it to be more effective than two other previous products.</li>
            <li>I do recommend using a high SPF sunblock while using this product for maximum results.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone suffering from hyperpigmentation.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommend.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this.  </li>
            <li>I do highly recommend that you do not expose yourself to sunlight during the course of using the product as I did notice that this causes dis-coloration.</li>
            <li>Maybe after the second peel it comes back lighter and maybe, I am hoping after a few treatments it really disappears and I a happy</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I had really high hopes for this product with all</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>do not have to clean your face with alcohol as long as is clean.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do not mean that Il even feel it burning</li>
            <li>This product helped to reduce the appearance of some of my problem areas pretty quickly considering the other products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Excited about my new complexion, I got a little ahead of myself and exfoliated with my supersonic spin brush and had to stop using the serum for a bit because the strong exfoliating irritated the area, so don&#x27;t make the same mistake I did!!</li>
            <li>The customer service was great with this company but unfortunately this did not work for me in treating melasma.  </li>
            <li>However, just because it has natural ingredients does not make it gentle, the hydroquinone outweighs any of the perceived safer ingredients.</li>
            <li>The most important thing to remember is when you are using a skin fading product use sun screen protector of at least 35 and apply 2 to 3 times a day if you are outside.</li>
            <li>I did have a moderate amount of peeling and redness, but completely worth it.  </li>
            <li>It does peel off dead skin cells to reveal healthy skin cells and that&#x27;s the color you should expect to see.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>This is the first and only product I have found that really lightened my skin.</li>
            <li>I do my normal evening routing and use the product over my moisturizer, etc.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for two weeks and the brown spots on my upper lip have pretty much disappeared,</li>
            <li>Understand that I have used TONS of different products to try and get rid of my hyperpigmented scars, all without success.</li>
            <li>but I think that is normal.</li>
            <li>I have hyperpigmentation (HP) on top of my left eyebrow, and a little on the right side as well.</li>
            <li>Luckily, it will heel over time and possibly fade away to my natural skin tone, but until then I just have to wait and wait and wait...</li>
            <li>This helps your face look less shiny/ more matted and natural.  </li>
            <li>I know you&#x27;ve probably heard it a million times, but sunscreen is crucial to skin health, ESPECIALLY if you&#x27;re using a product as strong as this one!een before stepping out of my house in the morning.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t forget to use a strong broad-spectrum sunscreen when you go outside (even just for a short while) because otherwise your freckles or sunspots will return and be even darker!</li>
            <li>Suddenly I have hyper pigmentation on my right hand.</li>
            <li>but it came right back.  </li>
            <li>This office had about six different product lines on the shelf and the esthetican went right to Glytone Step</li>
            <li>This product uses a variety of ingredients that create a synergetic effect and they really work without lightening your face only in certain areas.</li>
            <li>- Gently brush face with a DRY (completely product free) general face or bronzer brush.  </li>
            <li>It goes on for a week or two (and people stare at my forehead), but then the new skin underneath is lighten and softer looking.</li>
            <li>I experienced major hyperpigmentation with my last pregnancy and while the majority of it faded within a year of my son being born, I am still left with a little on my forehead and on both cheeks.</li>
            <li>I was surprised at how many dead skin cells that had cumulated on my face all these year.</li>
            <li>My face is glowing and very clear.  </li>
            <li>Some mild peeling occurred the first few times I used it, but not since.</li>
            <li>a copuple of brown spots on my face , one has gone completely , another one ( was a bit darker to start with) is still there but much lighter , and i still have more than half a bottle left .</li>
            <li>I used to get chemical peels every month and after almost a year, it did  get rid of a huge dark spot I had</li>
            <li>The darkness on my ears is completely gone!</li>
            <li>What can I say but thank to whoever developed this life saving product!</li>
            <li>I have had brown spots on my upper lip, it is VERY noticeable to me!</li>
            <li>I put it on that first night, and when I woke up the next morning, my face was peeling like a snake.</li>
            <li>So needless to say, I&#x27;m thrilled!  </li>
            <li>This is my first Amazon review, and the only reason I&#x27;m doing it is because I HAVE to give this product its Kudos.  </li>
            <li>the first ingredient is water the second is glycolic acid.  </li>
            <li>This product turned my skin slightly red within the first couple days of use.</li>
            <li>After using it for 10 days the spot was completely gone!  </li>
            <li>I gave up the sun over a year ago and with my skin returning to its natural color, boy did the sun damage show!</li>
            <li>My burn scar remains exactly the same.</li>
            <li>Specifically for me through my years of that for my skin type (milk chocolate), I have noticed that any type of alcohol doesn&#x27;t agree with my skin and does cause it to become even more darkened or yield no change; tea tree oil is no better.</li>
            <li>( and yes I love myself, I just love glowing skin, so don&#x27;t get it twisted)....!</li>
            <li>At first I was seeing a big difference in my post acne marks</li>
            <li>It worked but made my skin so oily not to mention the nearly $600 price tag per month!</li>
            <li>Yes your skin will peel off getting rid of the old skin and bringing in the new skin.  </li>
            <li>I had a huge hyperpigmentation issue that I could not keep hidden under make up.  </li>
            <li>far as application itself - it definitely stings quite a bit when you first put it on, but that stinging goes away after about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>I am a dark skinned female &amp; I love the skin I&#x27;m in.</li>
            <li>This product should have more hydroquinone in it, especially for people with darker than average knees and elbows.</li>
            <li>It is just as expensive as other products I have tried but far more effective.</li>
            <li>It is good to note that my melasma is due to excessive sun exposure and even using the sun block doesn’t</li>
            <li>A large brownish spot on my left arm has noticeably faded using this.</li>
            <li>It stings a little at first but the affects on the skin were evident..</li>
            <li>I had super dark almost black melasma on my neck and as a very white skinned person it looked more like a hickey...</li>
            <li>The acne locations heal to clear skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I decided to use it and found that it not only lightened up those huge facial scars, but also gave me back my self-esteem!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t notice much difference with regards to lightening of dark marks on my face still halfway on my first bottle</li>
            <li>but I really dislike the old lady smell and greasy feel and would not use it religiously enough for long-term results.</li>
            <li>The upper lip melasma is really terrible....making me so self conscious.</li>
            <li>spots going going wow</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased two bottles so far and have had no side effects.</li>
            <li>have just used for 3 days so far, I will await a month or so before upgrading my ratings</li>
            <li>I will keep using it until they are completely gone.</li>
            <li>I thought OK, at least it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li>WOW.</li>
            <li>So far I haven&#x27;t had any peeling or redness.</li>
            <li>so I do not feel self conscious about myself.</li>
            <li>wow.  </li>
            <li>My 34 year old daughter and I (age 60) used this product for two weeks and did feel a tingling sensation while applying it.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>and I have had them for twenty years or so because I was not using sun screen so much when I was younger.</li>
            <li>Overall, they don&#x27;t standout on my face as much as before.</li>
            <li>I would also say that the overall appearance of my skin is much improved since I&#x27;ve been using this.</li>
            <li>I started using this product along with ROC product and WOW.</li>
            <li>Within 2 or 3 days I noticed marked lightening of the areas I wanted to treat.</li>
            <li>but I have notice it does make any area you applied sensitive to sunlight.</li>
            <li>daystar.&lt;br /&gt;The product doesn&#x27;t get rid of it completely</li>
            <li>and I guess I am too sensitive.</li>
            <li>and it is working for me, so far.</li>
            <li>The serum is non-greasy, it absorbs completely into my skin so</li>
            <li>So with this regimen, I will be completely avoiding products that contain them.    </li>
            <li>I got it early which is a plus</li>
            <li>So far, no peeling yet.</li>
            <li>Oh, I have sensitive combination skin.</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;m nearly 3 weeks into using this product, and it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li>I use a shade lighter than what naturally blends with my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t feel like people can even notice the discoloration that I was so self conscious about.  </li>
            <li>was that I also have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t recommend to the person with sensitive skin since this one somewhat irritates during the process.</li>
            <li>We all have different skin types and I found something that really works for me.</li>
            <li>and I have been using the serum for about three weeks now and already see a marked difference.</li>
            <li>I would not advise anyone with sensitive skin to try this product.</li>
            <li>I do not consider my skin to be sensitive</li>
            <li>It took a whole bottle but if you don&#x27;t use sunscreen it&#x27;ll come back darker than before!</li>
            <li>So far this product seems to be lightening the spots I got during a stress breakout.</li>
            <li>Not working for me at all soo far ..</li>
            <li>I was left with these very unattractive scars on my face.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin i WOULD NOT recommend using this product.</li>
            <li>I have a skin condition called hyperpigmation, purchased the product that promises that it is a professional strength product that works to correct hyperpigmation</li>
            <li>It takes of the dead skin which can appear to make the area more red, but through continued uses, it will lighten up.</li>
            <li>I finally have my melasma under control ( at least the visible aspect of it, now the hormonal is another aspect on its own)  </li>
            <li>I needed a little help with dark pigmentation after no sun protection for most of my outdoor life and it&#x27;s working!</li>
            <li>Like I mentioned earlier, the product is quite potent and makes your skin peel, therefore I&#x27;ve only been using it every other night (sometimes every two nights) to give my skin a bit of a break from the irritation.</li>
            <li>I was a little skeptical that this product would work, but the reviews were pretty good and the price was reasonable</li>
            <li>For those with super sensitive skin I will add that there can be a slight peeling on affected areas</li>
            <li>I have many dark spots on my upper cheeks after I had my second child.</li>
            <li>Noticeable softness in complexion is achieved in just two days with dark marks fading and the overall complexion blending into a smooth hue.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update: I finished the first bottle, but after a lapse in use my melasma came back again,  I purchased a second bottle</li>
            <li>I was afraid that if it was too strong or more like a peel, i would wake up with red spots or blisters on my face and chin.  </li>
            <li>I have spots on my upper lip, similar to another reviewer, and they made me very self conscious.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s worth a try if you struggle with dark spots and melasma.</li>
            <li>Not only are the dark spots significantly lighter, but my skin also looks brighter, tighter and healthier.</li>
            <li>The first night I applied it as directions told me, and not much happened..</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m almost 40 years old with fair skin prone to freckling, melanoma, and an irritating tendency to break out with acne if I don&#x27;t keep it carefully under control.</li>
            <li>did more good than this - sorry!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m gonna skip a day to give my skin a chance to calm down</li>
            <li>Definitely worth a try if you are feeling mortified by discoloration due to the sun induced melasma!  </li>
            <li>I have had a large developing brown spot on my forehead for the last several years.</li>
            <li>There is slight redness and peeling next day after use, but I&#x27;ve noticed a significant lighting of the melasma in just three weeks of use-once per day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using this new product for 4 days</li>
            <li>but, I experienced darkened and reddened areas on the few spots on my face that I applied it making them look much worse.</li>
            <li>I will be the happiest old woman with clear white porcelain skin on earth.</li>
            <li>The spots are not completely gone, but significantly faded to where make-up covers it up very well, and that&#x27;s after only treating it for about 2 weeks, whereas the other stuff didn&#x27;t do anything after 8 weeks of religious use!!</li>
            <li>Melasma is very stubborn and I have learned that you MUST wear sunscreen even for the five minutes that you will be outside regardless if it is sunny or not especially in the summer months!!  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t think I used long enough need to use consistently</li>
            <li>When you get within that range they are still very apparent.  </li>
            <li>but nothing major</li>
            <li>My complexion is a shade lighter, and I barely have blemishes!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using porcelain skin whitening serum for the last two weeks and WOW!</li>
            <li>I use it every night with no other products.</li>
            <li>What works on dark or dry skin might not work so well on light or oily skin...</li>
            <li>I actually used this with a cosmetic surgeon monitoring  the progess (mild dark spots) and he saw no difference.</li>
            <li>I am being very careful to use a good SPF whenever I&#x27;m in the sun too because I know that will make it worse.  </li>
            <li>I have tried peels and used hydroquinone in the past and they have all been a little effective in gradually fading my spots.</li>
            <li>My dermatologist advised me medications ranged from mild to strong whitening serum, cream and gel, none of them worked so far very expensive one (30 ml for 200$) .&lt;br</li>
            <li>The product is strong and I use a very small amount on the hyperpigmented areas...</li>
            <li>If you purchase the serum, definitely purchase a high SPF sunblock to wear regularly as well.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what the long term use will yield, but in the short run I&#x27;ve noticed my skin tone evening out and my skin becoming a little clearer.  </li>
            <li>Got dis product and within 1 week my face began to clear up and at 3rd week</li>
            <li>it can maintain a clear white porcelain skin.  </li>
            <li>After 8 weeks of use, I can barely see it anymore.</li>
            <li>the only natural sunscreen, all the others are chemicals...</li>
            <li>and I have no regrets.</li>
            <li>and i can barely see difference....</li>
            <li>me one of their products because they spent so much time explaining the skin and how it gets harmed from the sun and what to do about it.  </li>
            <li>so you have to be careful with how much you use and where.</li>
            <li>, that&#x27;s probably where I applied it too much, so I need to be careful.</li>
            <li>Now they are barely visible at all.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using it a week so far, but I&#x27;ll try to update after it&#x27;s been a while.</li>
            <li>I am 58 years old and my skin was showing sun worshipping damage in a big way.</li>
            <li>so much I barely see traces of it.  </li>
            <li>Only product so far that does what it says.</li>
            <li>The melasma aged me a lot and really bothered me.</li>
            <li>you barely feel it and</li>
            <li>This product lightened my sister&#x27;s dark melasma with first use.  </li>
            <li>did not really see any real effect.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have melasma on my upper lip which made me self conscious.</li>
            <li>In many cases, it makes things worse.  </li>
            <li>The serum is Ok, not great</li>
            <li>was kind of skeptical about purchasing the product to begin with since I had never heard of the brand.</li>
            <li>The drug store products now get absorbed into my skin since they are no longer blocked by the dead skin cells.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li>Now three weeks have gone by, I have noticed darkening of my skin in areas where, I repeatedly tried more than a thin layer of serum.</li>
            <li>Within the first wk I started seeing some slight peeling.  </li>
            <li>If I happen to get caught outside on a particularly sunny day, I know Im going to see the brown marks the next day, but they seem to fade over the next day or two if I use this consistently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an African American woman early 50&#x27;s who&#x27;s developed moderate hyperpigmentation.  </li>
            <li>Living in Las Vegas where the sun is all the time it&#x27;s hard to avoid the sun, but with this cream I can enjoy myself again outside.</li>
            <li>I was very self conscious about it, and tried a few creams, but it seemed it was here to stay.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used all different kinds of creams and lotions and by far, finally I have found the one that truly delivers.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t get my face back to rosy and soft before I had my second child.</li>
            <li>I had developed pretty severe melasma on my forehead over the past year.</li>
            <li>The second night I decided to use a little more this time because maybe i&#x27;d used too little.</li>
            <li>started seeing a little improvement within the first week.</li>
            <li>Summer is here and even though I use Broad Spectrum SPF 110 Sunscreen Lotion the Melasma spots are BACK!!!  </li>
            <li>I have spent hundreds of dollars on high end products which I won&#x27;t name</li>
            <li>My skin peeled off and revealed new pink skin with no grey!!!</li>
            <li>Prior to this, I was very self conscious about my skin because my hyper pigmentation was very dark and purple.</li>
            <li>I like this product so much because it is helping remove the dark spots and melasma on my face.</li>
            <li>I also was surprised that the product has lasted as long as it has.</li>
            <li>the first  few night after I applied  the serum</li>
            <li>applied this serum on dark spots only, and I put the other product on whole area of skin.&lt;br /&gt;long story short, it really works.</li>
            <li>At that time, I developed some of the dry flaking as indicated may occur in the instructions.</li>
            <li>but this was an amazingly fast inexpensive treatment for me and as a black woman that&#x27;s saying a lot.</li>
            <li>After a few days I notice the HP gotten darker and stands out more than it usually does.</li>
            <li>I started with IPL&#x27;s not very good success.</li>
            <li>It really works and it&#x27;s not as expensive as I used to pay for many other similar products that I purchased before.</li>
            <li>i put a small amount above my lips (right under my nose is where my melasma i  )</li>
            <li>I decided to try this product because it had good reviews and was way less expensive than the lazar treatments.</li>
            <li>I mean I got results after the very first use</li>
            <li>I HAD major melasma on my cheeks, forehead and chin - my skin is not completely clear, but</li>
            <li>skin had this hyperpigmentation condition and it was super dark, until I seen a picture from a previous user.</li>
            <li>After almost 2 weeks of use my dark spots have nearly vanished!!</li>
            <li>My wife has melasma on her face due to sun exposure,  Right after my wife started applying this skin whitening solution, I am seeing the pigmentation slowly going away and seeing the skin getting normal color and getting smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>

            <li> Make sure you use a very good sunscreen when you use Porcelain.</li>
            <li> it came in the box in good condition no damage or anything.</li>
            <li> I tried to be fair</li>
            <li> Product is doing a good job with fading of sun spots on my face.</li>
            <li> I thought this product is good to keep around.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on the good review.</li>
            <li> I am delighted with this product.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> it sounds really good</li>
            <li> To be fair, I have not tried this product yet.</li>
            <li> Yes, there will be some flaking of your skin but honestly, it&#x27;s nothing I haven&#x27;t experienced before.</li>
            <li> i haven&#x27;t seen any changes,and therefore i am not going to give it a good review..</li>
            <li> I also felt secure in ordering the product because of the return policy they had, awesome.  </li>
            <li> Good product for the money</li>
            <li> This wasn&#x27;t a good look as my face is my business.</li>
            <li> I purchased this Murad skin whitening serum after seeing it recommended by Good Housekeeping magazine.</li>
            <li> This did not work as good as the kojic soap bar did</li>
            <li> It does a good job at removing what it&#x27;s supposed</li>
            <li> Its worthy it, you have to have a great soap as well!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I am so happy that this product has worked for me :)</li>
            <li> I am so happy that this product has worked for me :)</li>
            <li> It is not harsh to the skin, absorbs readily, great under makeup, and best of all works!</li>
            <li> This is remarkable for me as I tend to react to everything but the most hypo-allergenic products.  </li>
            <li> You have to be patient to see results and with continuous use you will be just as satisfied as I am!</li>
            <li> I was so pleased with this product!</li>
            <li> And pain on top of it! *</li>
            <li> Love this product!  </li>
            <li> Hello All, I have to say I love this product!</li>
            <li> So, after years of trying tons of products to figure out the perfect blend, I thought I&#x27;d also include my exact regiment in case you are feeling helpless and like nothing will work to make you feel</li>
            <li> I absolutley love this!</li>
            <li> After using this product for about 2 weeks, most of the spots already appear lighter!</li>
            <li> and she looks better than ever!</li>
            <li> This stuff feels great on my skin, has no odor, and gives quick results!  </li>
            <li> I  noticed my skin is more bright , even and glowing just couple days using this product.</li>
            <li> but it is amazing how well the brown is disappearing</li>
            <li> I was worried about taking a risk on this  over the counter product, however, the results were amazing.</li>
            <li> My skin looks amazing.</li>
            <li> ... and if it does, I hope it&#x27;s the treatable kind because I don&#x27;t plan on stopping.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was excellent and very timely.</li>
            <li> Love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried IPL and had a good peel.</li>
            <li> nice brightening serum.</li>
            <li> I took care of the burnt spots with Neosporin‎ and it healed/peeled nicely.</li>
            <li> honestly I think I not from a knock off company.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe something this inexpensive could be so effective.</li>
            <li> &amp; I can honestly tell you that this product works.</li>
            <li> I was kind of hesitant to buy it because of the name.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m already a goodlooking attractive female but that glow, makes my skin look flawless.</li>
            <li> Honestly, this price for a 2 oz.</li>
            <li> I was so thrilled.</li>
            <li> SOO EFFECTIVELY</li>
            <li> I have to be honest.</li>
            <li> :) :) now warning: there is a bit of discomfort, I experienced redness and burning but it is tolerable.</li>
            <li> e visible aspect of it, now the hormonal is another aspect on its own)  </li>
            <li> so here I was on Amazon searching for a cheaper alternative that is effective..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll order another to keep handy...</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream almost two week for my discoloration on my skin (medium skin tone and 30 age) but honestly i haven&#x27;t seen any difference</li>
            <li> Seller was very nice and gave me a hassle free refund.</li>
            <li> Certainly worth the results in my mind!!!</li>
            <li> I have an olive skin tone which scars very easily.</li>
            <li> but it has made me more confident!</li>
            <li> I got results in two days, my skin just keeps getting better and better!</li>
            <li> When I have had dryness or peeling, I make sure to exfoliate.&lt;br /&gt;Really really pleased!</li>
            <li> Love love!</li>
            <li> Amazing magic serum works</li>
            <li> Thank you for creating this amazing stuff it saved me :)</li>
            <li> I rarely review products but am so happy this one has worked for me.</li>
            <li> This gel is the best for a clear skin.</li>
            <li> My mom bought this and so far it has worked great!</li>
            <li> The chemical is so strong !</li>
            <li> , i was so excited to get this after reading all the good reviews about this cream</li>
            <li> MY SKIN IS LOOKING GREAT FOR THE FIRST TIME IN YEARS.</li>
            <li> spots on my hand is all gone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: the container is very cheap.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin very smooth though.</li>
            <li> have very fair, sensitive, and acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li> before I say I love it.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I found this product.  </li>
            <li> and I love the way the gel disappears after the application...</li>
            <li> Ok, now onto the product.</li>
            <li> It is ok.</li>
            <li> Four weeks after peeling from the IPL treatment, the area had the most peel also turned the most pigmented.</li>
            <li> Love this serum.</li>
            <li> really love this product.</li>
            <li> Many spots.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t give many reviews for products I buy</li>
            <li> After many years of the search for the product that works, I found it.</li>
            <li> My skin does feel smoother and maybe with more time I will see improved results.  </li>
            <li> Also, you must make sure you keep the area moisturized because it will tend to look like snake skin after use if not keep moisturized.</li>
            <li> kids love this.</li>
            <li> I mostly cook vegan dishes now and try to stay away from all dairy and meat.</li>
            <li> My skin defiantly changed for the better after two uses.</li>
            <li> Then I tried it more offten that your suppose to and it burned my skin.</li>
            <li> and my melasma looks so much better.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if this would work or not</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d love results in the morning.</li>
            <li> Just burned a lot more then anything.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, its a okay product.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> My skin tone seems more even</li>
            <li> but I feel like this porcelain skin serum had the most to do with it..</li>
            <li> I would love to return this product if I could.</li>
            <li> I love, love this product and the price.</li>
            <li> I jus love this product..</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> me tell you, I wouldn&#x27;t take the time to sit here and write a review about something that hasn&#x27;t made me very happy unless I really felt that the product is worth it.  </li>
            <li> this product has given me confidence in my face again!  :)</li>
            <li> Once summer is over, I am confident that I will have even more resolution.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> &amp; I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll see more in time.  </li>
            <li> May need to order more see what happens, so would purchase again.</li>
            <li> My husband says the lip browning is much better, I no longer look like I need to shave.</li>
            <li> LOVE this product, it worked wonders on my skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s even more noticeable to others than  a mirror state for yourself..</li>
            <li> Love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you are just peeling your face over and over again which I cannot imagine it is healthy for your skin.</li>
            <li> The results have not been magical or miraculous.</li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> does cause redness and peeling, but I started using moisturizer with vitamin C on top of this Porcelain Skin Whitening Serum and it has helped.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But here&#x27;s hoping it will also end up lightening things as well :)</li>
            <li> Ascorbate: vitamin C that&#x27;s been modified to be more lipid soluble to allow it to better penetrate skin</li>
            <li> For 30.00 this is way better in price n</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many products but never saw any difference.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so glad I did.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this product :)</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with the feel of my skin and the brown spots are disappearing.</li>
            <li> this serum peeled my face really good.im happy with the product.</li>
            <li> To avoid itching and get better skin cleansing results, I will be using microfiber face cloths.</li>
            <li> I am glad, I did.</li>
            <li> I did not want to lighten my skin, I just wanted a more even complexion.</li>
            <li> I will continue using it for a couple more weeks.</li>
            <li> I did try laser treatment a year or so ago, which did give even better results.</li>
            <li> http://www.amazon.com/Np-Set-Concealer-Look-0-5-ounce/dp/B002LDUSOM/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1371611979&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;np+set+concealer&lt;br /&gt;4 - Brush on appropriate shade of M.A.C. Face and Body Foundation.</li>
            <li> am satisfied with this product</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t blame the serum, because my skin has been discolored for many years.  </li>
            <li> I will be ordering more when this one runs out.</li>
            <li> OK, I hear people saying, &amp;#34;Oh</li>
            <li> They are much better with in the 3 week of using it so</li>
            <li> I got his like dime size mark on the top of my foot.</li>
            <li> can say now I am feeling better ,</li>
            <li> it be good if i continue using even i have already obtain a good clear translucent skin?  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Thank you and appreciate your precious advice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regards&lt;br /&gt;Chelsa</li>
            <li> At this rate, within another week, I&amp;#34;ll be able to get away with using just a bronzer.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this product.</li>
            <li> My skin looks so much better now.</li>
            <li> Just go with something light and have lots of patience to allow your skin to repair on its own</li>
            <li> so it may work better for Caucasian skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it at night and an spf 110 from Neutrogena during the day to be sure they stay gone.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not using it to whiten my skin but to create a healthy glow, which this serum does for me.  </li>
            <li> AND I LOVE</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ordering more.</li>
            <li> I need more time to see the lightening effects.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got all the top ingrediants,so</li>
            <li> Am so glad I did because it has cleared up my cheeks...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Upated on 13 july 2013&lt;br /&gt; Its been more than a month i havent seen any difference at all by using this cream and also bit upset becuz</li>
            <li> family has remarked at how much better my face looks.  </li>
            <li> &quot; I&#x27;ve tried everything else and thought I would try one more thing before spending the money on a dermatologist.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t say it&#x27;s a skin whitening product, it&#x27;s more of skin brightening and lightening.</li>
            <li> My face is also brighter and more even looking, and my acne is gone.</li>
            <li> hahahaha!!!! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> Very exciting!</li>
            <li> But so far, so good!</li>
            <li> Pretty good for melasma</li>
            <li> My skin was look pretty good and lighting</li>
            <li> Best skin whitening serum I&#x27;ve used in really long time</li>
            <li> In 2 weeks i saw significant results, and on the 3rd week I am very impressed.</li>
            <li> plus it&#x27;s a day time moisturizer with beautiful ingredients that you can pronounce and eat many of them, big</li>
            <li> My skin after a week looks smooth, more even, and prettier than before I began using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I took that as a free consultation :).</li>
            <li> Some of them are good size and very visible</li>
            <li> This lightener is a good product, it seems to be working really well for me.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product!</li>
            <li> I have found that the Sephora Brush #56 does a great job at applying the foundation, keeping it light, well blended, and natural looking.</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t push it so easy and always splash on my hand.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am really happy with this product, but hope when I have to order my next bottle the pump will work better.</li>
            <li> The consistency is easy to spread over skin and isn&#x27;t sticky or greasy.</li>
            <li> However it is not as strong as a peel or a spa treatment but for those of us on a budget it works.</li>
            <li> She said to use it once a day because it&#x27;s so strong and after three weeks use it twice a day.</li>
            <li> Do not perform any glycolic peels or strong skin treatments during the treatment.</li>
            <li> This is some Strong stuff use with coution.</li>
            <li> If you have struggled with blemishes, I would strongly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It causes some peeling, so it&#x27;s like a chemical peel in that sense but not as strong.  </li>
            <li> Honestly, I was sold after the first use.</li>
            <li> I opted not to and instead researched the best way to remove dark spots.</li>
            <li> far it seems to be working great as I have seen lightening of some acne spots , the true test will be the lightening of my melasma spots&lt;br /&gt;note</li>
            <li> You are absolutely fine exposing yourself to sunlight after the product and this does not affect you.</li>
            <li> Quick results!  </li>
            <li> Great, it is good product seems to be lightening the dark spot, my skin was breakout , it is really working well for me for me, i need more time to see the lightening</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is very important to use sunscreen all the time when you are out in the sun, or the spots will come right back.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I already see a huge improvement in my melasma and sun spots.</li>
            <li> I can see a huge difference in my cheek area and</li>
            <li> Amazing, highly recommended for African-American skin!</li>
            <li> But its worth it. :)</li>
            <li> Overall happy.</li>
            <li> To be honest, I wasn&#x27;t expecting much because of the price--In the spa, products of this nature often cost over $100.00.</li>
            <li> Smooth deal.</li>
            <li> Acid: skin lightener &amp; antioxidant; reduces production of melanin; deteriorates in air &amp; light</li>
            <li> I bought the MD oil free sunscreen together with this product.</li>
            <li> but overall not all that happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> - Apply Aquaphor advanced healing moisturizer over any parts of the face that are dry:&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so light</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Latina w light tan skin.</li>
            <li> It also leaves your skin feeling smooth.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so smooth.</li>
            <li> Redness and light peeling may occur.</li>
            <li> I also am giving it five stars for fast shipping and for it being a nice sized bottle.</li>
            <li> Seems really important to keep out of the sun at this point…  </li>
            <li> Plus shipping is free.  </li>
            <li> After 35 years of buying nearly every available product out in the market, I must say that this one is by far the best!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so light and the effects are almost immediate.&lt;br</li>
            <li> MY FACE IS REALLY SMOOTH WITH THIS.</li>
            <li> Effective yet gentle.</li>
            <li> I have NOT noticed any change in my brown spots on my face - using good old cheap lemon juice</li>
            <li> So far the Product show good  result</li>
            <li> So far so good...</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s active ingredients it makes it sound very good and convinces you that it will work</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it every other night for about 6 weeks and have seen an incredible improvement in my complexion.</li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;ll never have pristine, smooth skin, this has made a significant difference in my appearance.</li>
            <li> When the bottle is gone I will definitely reorder, which is the greatest testament.is considered as normal.</li>
            <li> SIGNIFICANTLY.  </li>
            <li> kept using this products 2 more weeks after the first review.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m consistently amazed at people who expect a product to work like magic.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try it..  </li>
            <li> As a long time sufferer of Melasma I have great hopes for this product.</li>
            <li> very good peouct for those who wana remove black spotting from face.</li>
            <li> yeaaa clean skin at last.worth it.</li>
            <li> I apply to a clean face with a cotton ball where the melisma (brown spots) are at night.  </li>
            <li> I followed the directions and applied this product on clean face at night</li>
            <li> I have experienced red and peeling skin, however it is worth it.</li>
            <li> I decided to purchase this items after checking many positive reviews.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I decided to give this a try based on the many positive reviews....</li>
            <li> I would buy it again because it clearly helped me feel and look better!</li>
            <li> The sunscreen must MUST contain zinc oxide or titanium dioxide for it to be effective on melasma, any old sunscreen will not work!  </li>
            <li> But if you are like me, with healthy and good skin condition other then some blemishes, this will do the job.</li>
            <li> This may be a special case, but if I were you</li>
            <li> Specially on my cheeks....</li>
            <li> I am Asian, south east Asia, my skin is tan, I want to have bright tan face.</li>
            <li> This is my first Amazon review, I decided that this product was worth reviewing :)</li>
            <li> but it is the true.</li>
            <li> Have been using for more than a month a don&#x27;t really see any lightening of my sunspots.</li>
            <li> This product really works as many others have stated.</li>
            <li> I have malasma and have tried using almost about everything to lighten it and about 2 yrs ago, I tried n paid for a full IPL photo</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never heard of this brand but the reviews were good enough for me to try it.</li>
            <li> Good results, my fourth bottle</li>
            <li> I use fair and white lotion for my body.</li>
            <li> With summer being in full swing, I&#x27;m taking a break from use.</li>
            <li> --now I don&amp;#34;t need too much makeup because my skin tone is more even.</li>
            <li> FAR IAM LOVING</li>
            <li> SHIPPPPING WAS REALLY FAST ALSO SO ANOTHER 5 STARS TO THAT :)</li>
            <li> The skin on my ears did peel (not badly)</li>
            <li> and before it was really not bad</li>
            <li> figured I would give it a try and the price was not bad.</li>
            <li> Product came quickly with great informative paperwork that I read carefully.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m brown skinned too, and the resulting pigmentation is pretty strong.  </li>
            <li> Seriously, one of the BEST decisions I&#x27;ve ever made!</li>
            <li> am so super grateful for this product</li>
            <li> But quickly plateaus.</li>
            <li> but it helped mildly.  </li>
            <li> Quick delivery, I&#x27;m using the produce at night, have seem some results</li>
            <li> I did peel initially, but it was great because firstly, my whole face did not peel at once.</li>
            <li> Also some of the ingredient is carcinogenic so assess the product and ask yourself if you&#x27;re feelin lucky.</li>
            <li> It is an investment that is worth so much to me in the confidence I am able to exude because my skin looks evenly toned</li>
            <li> Quick turn around.  </li>
            <li> I think people with mild  discoloration may be helped.</li>
            <li> I use many high end skin moisturizers and anti-aging stuff.</li>
            <li> My first night using it (Fri nite), I felt it stinging, but  I just tapped lightly on the spots I put it on, and the mild pain subsided.  </li>
            <li> My skin is still nowhere near perfect, but I certainly see a little more improvement after each use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , my face was bk to normal even better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s important to note to consumers who may not be aware of how hyperpigmentation works, you must must must wear sunscreen every day during and after the fading process.</li>
            <li> bottle of product with these ingredients is pretty fabulous.</li>
            <li> so I am taking the time to write a review because it is very much deserved for this product!  </li>
            <li> I am using less concealer each day and am happy with the results.</li>
            <li> I am so glad all of you has shared the feedback and because of your feedback, I am willing to try this reasonable price product.</li>
            <li> within the first week of use I began to peel, the darkened areas around my cheek literally began to peel!</li>
            <li> I really hope it&#x27;s working!!</li>
            <li> My skin looked overall nice where I applied it, so now I kind of sweep a bit all over, to even skintone in general.</li>
            <li> Stay away from the sun while using and even hot yoga is not goood!</li>
            <li> I really see the change in the spots!!</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference in my skin within the first week!</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;m ready for work looking absolutly fine.</li>
            <li> It applies smooth and dries fast.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic as well as reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> However if this product is going to work it would have worked on its own, another month later still no change what so ever.</li>
            <li> Thought it was worth a try</li>
            <li> This product is worth the buck.</li>
            <li> Is it worth it?  </li>
            <li> but I took a chance and purchased it thinking it would be worth it if it worked.</li>
            <li> I would love to buy it by the quart for my arms and legs that are getting old and blotchy.  </li>
            <li> what it is worth</li>
            <li> I wanted to try a product that had more natural ingredients in it.  </li>
            <li> Better than the px topical antibiotics I use, better than retin a,  better than benzyol peroxide cream in my current arsenal!  </li>
            <li> I have been struggling to lighten the areas for 2 yrs now without success and it hasn&#x27;t went away.  </li>
            <li> I definitley plan on purchasing another bottle, it was worth the investment.</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t bother to write reviews but after seeing the great positive result am experiencing, I wanted to share it, in case someone is going through the same skin discoloration I was going through.</li>
            <li> I have used other hydroquinone products without great results, but the description of this product sounded promising,  so I ordered it.</li>
            <li> The price was right</li>
            <li> By using it for couple of days, I noticed the difference right away.  </li>
            <li> I am seeing the result right now..</li>
            <li> I had a reaction from my birth control that gave me melasma right before my wedding.</li>
            <li> Absorbs right into the skin.</li>
            <li> I have been a looking for the right product to get rid of my acne scars the issue with that</li>
            <li> This is great for wrinkles, hyperpigmentation, scars, and so many other things because it reveals new skin completely.</li>
            <li> , it was more of a mild to moderate case of Melasma</li>
            <li> This was okay at controlling acne but barely did anything to lighten acne scars.  </li>
            <li> The top layer of my skin started peeling after the very first use and I saw result it looked like what&#x27;s left after a snake shred</li>
            <li> /&gt;Really great product and in the future I will definitely purchase this again!</li>
            <li> I was waiting on the edge of my seat to receive this &amp; it was delivered in such a FAST time frame that was amazing on its own!&lt;br /&gt;Second-</li>
            <li> I expect that after a few more weeks I will not be able to see it at all.</li>
            <li> I used to put full coverage makeup on (dermablend) on and would still be able to see a grey mustache and cheeks...</li>
            <li> It is really working quickly on this area.</li>
            <li> Great results for severe melasma after only 6 weeks of daily use!</li>
            <li> This product really works if you have dark  spots on your face, you must purchase this as soon as possible - it&#x27;s a miracle &amp; excellent price,</li>
            <li> After trying so many different products I found Porcelain Skin Whitening Serum to work not only effectively but also fast.</li>
            <li> and it costs too much, this product works fast and the price is worth every penny for me because it works!  </li>
            <li> The only warning I would have is that this product is strong and works quickly.  </li>
            <li> am now on my FOURTH night of using it &amp; have ALREADY SAW A HUGE DIFFERENCE!</li>
            <li> first two weeks</li>
            <li> It is a lot easier to see your dermatologist and get an rX for the hydroquinone in a higher percentage to treat the melasma.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m beginning to wonder if many of the reviews were posted by the company selling the product rather than actually consumers.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different products for my melasma.</li>
            <li> , i am using it exactly like the instruction says.</li>
            <li> Yeeeeeees, I found the product that really works!</li>
            <li> so I ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;FIRST-Super fast ship!</li>
            <li> Today was the first day I put make up on</li>
            <li> The product label looked a bit funny.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t use any face creams or washes ( just hot water and cetephil once a day) and started using M.A.C. makeup- the powder as concealer.</li>
            <li> so I am aware of the ingredients and how they affect the skin.</li>
            <li> Gently pat it into your face until absorbed.</li>
            <li> The product actually burnt me; however, I received a refund. :)</li>
            <li> first week there was a bit of stinging, and redness, but never any peeling.</li>
            <li> First of all, when I ordered it, it said it would take a week for delivery.  </li>
            <li> but Im hesitant to spend any more on the same product with inconsistent results.</li>
            <li> so when I first used this it did burn/peel parts of my face.</li>
            <li> like I was after the first treatment.</li>
            <li> I am 2/3 through my first bottle that I bought 2 months ago</li>
            <li> and I am back to buy more.</li>
            <li> Absolutely nothing!</li>
            <li> Within the first week I saw a difference.</li>
            <li> At first it seemed to have gotten darker</li>
            <li> n noticed a difference within the first week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I finally found something that works.</li>
            <li> I have pretty severe Melasma on my face.</li>
            <li> I will definitely order this again as this is the most improvement I&#x27;ve seen from any product I&#x27;ve tried for Melasma.</li>
            <li> Took pictures on my first day and compared it to show my friends.</li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s okay,</li>
            <li> The first night I used it I woke up and noticed some peeling.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone instead of the the expensive perscription drugs that dont offer this good of result!!</li>
            <li> Applied it on the first night.</li>
            <li> Will start using it in the fall when it&#x27;s not as hot or humid.</li>
            <li> The first night I used it</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;m going to try this again when my skin clears up because I really want it to work!</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE FIRST PRODUCT THAT EVER HELP WITH MY MALASMA.  </li>
            <li> Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> then I just apply for one night and I am back to norm again :).  </li>
            <li> I think you have to be consistent to have it work.</li>
            <li> MY FIRST EXPERIENCE WITH HYDROQUINONE</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been 10 days to be exact since I started using the product</li>
            <li> Each cost $100 a piece and is not guaranteed to work (Her exact words)</li>
            <li> I need a higher dosage since I got the lowest?</li>
            <li> but I noticed the skin is much softer !</li>
            <li> I saw results within the first week of use.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say i began to see a difference after the first week.</li>
            <li> I can swear to confirm that i do see good results of whitening of my melsama and uneven skintone.  </li>
            <li> Mild peeling, not much redness or irritation but all of that is better than the brown spots.</li>
            <li> I have a very sensitive skin and during all treatment every night my skin got red and kind of hitching for 20 min</li>
            <li> Over the years, I went from one product to another, I spent so much money consulting with dermatologist, I went to Spas and did so many facials all to no avail!</li>
            <li> It has not gotten rid of all of it completely, but it has made a significant difference.</li>
            <li> I am not only using this product I wash my face with fair and white (AHA orange box), take glutathione 1500 mg (by Ivory caps) and this stuff.</li>
            <li> First off let me tell you what nationalities I am and what color and type of skin I have, because that does make a difference when looking for certain skin care products.</li>
            <li> After reading all the positive reviews, I thought I should give it a try.</li>
            <li> I purchased this based on positive reviews-  and have been using it for 5 days approx.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used so many products that I&#x27;ve purchased at top stores such as Sephora and spent over $100s of dollars on name brands, in which they didn&#x27;t work!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thank you so much, and I really thank Jesus Who I prayed to for helping to find this product!</li>
            <li> Look up the strange chemical names,, if there are too many, forget it.</li>
            <li> I use this every morning and night, and it was very stingy at first, so I combined it with a whitening lotion (the one that has both day and night formulas)</li>
            <li> Against my better judgement, I tried it, and after a few days, I started noticing significant lightening.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I want products that work within a small amount of time and do a good job.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure if I would have as good results without the combination of the 2 products.</li>
            <li> but it is still early to  give full judgment.</li>
            <li> The process takes time but you will definitely notice a cleaner more high lighted skin tone</li>
            <li> Make sure to wash off before you go outside and don&#x27;t put tons on you can get dry skin, other then that this is the best cream ever with actual results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been able to abandon my normal regimen of tea tree oil + acne control moisturizer (Yonka 15 Creme) and simply use this at night.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin so most things make me peel.</li>
            <li> But my results were pretty fantastic for a topical product.</li>
            <li> I am feeling much better now, I am trying to minimize sun exposure and religiously I am applying It once a  day (normally at night before  go to bed).</li>
            <li> It will make  your face red in areas with no discoloration, so it is strong, but it seems to work.</li>
            <li> It did cause the treated area to peel(it&#x27;s supposed to), but it was not excessively harsh, it was kind of like the peeling that happens after a minor sun burn.</li>
            <li> Your skin will peel in certain areas but I just exfoliated my face to get rid of that.</li>
            <li> 4% pure Hydroquinone on it before as prescribed by my dermatologist.</li>
            <li> I give this product 5 stars for effectively lightening 50% of dark hyper-pigmentation on elbows in 2 weeks!</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, it really boost whitening.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I absolutely recommend this product, my melasma went away</li>
            <li> /&gt;3.evoid sun as much as you can while using</li>
            <li> Very helpful for sunspots or discoloration.  </li>
            <li> the product is working very well after two weeks of using it...</li>
            <li> do not notice much change in pigmentation after weeks of use.</li>
            <li> I applied the light serum twice daily...</li>
            <li> I really appreciate dis product.</li>
            <li> This Porcelain serum really works wonder on my face.  </li>
            <li> They are gradually disappearing and I&#x27;m very content that there&#x27;s progress.</li>
            <li> I used according to instructions for 6 weeks on hands and face and there was absolutely change.  </li>
            <li> but my real rate is 0.</li>
            <li> I really want to warn those of you who are considering IPL.</li>
            <li> and it really does work</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t need so much.</li>
            <li> This product is really working well.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I became very depressed and began to look for solution.</li>
            <li> I read all the product information &amp; before going to bed that night I used it, honestly I really had no</li>
            <li> I experienced pretty heavy peeling of the area to which I applied the serum, maybe because it&#x27;s on the lip, but that&#x27;s a relatively minor side effect.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.</li>
            <li> Get an app for your phone for cosmetic ingredients, very useful.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Guys/Girls it really works and is not irritating.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t expect much from a non-prescription product, but this stuff really works.</li>
            <li> After spending so much money on dermatologist for 1 1/2 years.  </li>
            <li> and I was in so much pain.</li>
            <li> It did cause my skin to peel in the areas I applied it to but haven&#x27;t noticed the area lightening much.</li>
            <li> I was amazed at how well and fast</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend this product!</li>
            <li> When the spots started getting darker even with sunscreen I started researching around and found the reviews for this product very helpful.  </li>
            <li> I tried the whole bottle, produced irritation, itching and darkened my skin.</li>
            <li> This has been happening over a two week period and I have now stopped peeling and my skin is very visibly brighter, whiter and</li>
            <li> /&gt;Additionally, I must say, my face feels much lighter and smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not break out.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to make this a 5 star and</li>
            <li> I have melasma on on my face that looks like slightly red speckles or light smudges of dirt.</li>
            <li> So far, it was worth the money.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see much result</li>
            <li> I use it every day and have never broken out.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even put that much on.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also helped on a light brown area above my chin.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t really do much for me.</li>
            <li> This is working very well for me.</li>
            <li> now I haven&#x27;t really noticed any changes to my skin.</li>
            <li> i gotten from too much sun exposure.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t really care.</li>
            <li> I have not broken out from the product.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe how fast the delivery was.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping this product lived up to its lclaims</li>
            <li> I really do like this product and you should go out there and buy one.</li>
            <li> very well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> works very well.</li>
            <li> It did absolutely nothing for my condition.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely incredible!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it  was really uncomfy as I have feeling of burning on my skin</li>
            <li> I really can see the difference.</li>
            <li> and it really works.  </li>
            <li> After a month 95% of spots not visible and unless you are looking very closely the spots on my hands are gone.</li>
            <li> thank you very much.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the products i&#x27;ve purchased in the past (too many to name) barely gave me any satisfying results.</li>
            <li> I dont even have to wear as much foundatin anymore.</li>
            <li> and I really put a lot over my melasma</li>
            <li> I really feel that I need to let others know how well this worked for me.</li>
            <li> The skin started to peel revealing a much newer, lighter skin.</li>
            <li> It really looked like I had hair there</li>
            <li> My melasma has lightened so much that you can NOT tell I had a sun mustache, so happy!!&lt;br /&gt;Date</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m amazed to say, it really works.  </li>
            <li> fast delivery</li>
            <li> In search of looking for something that would truly deliver what it promise and doing my homework online, making sure the ingredients are natural as possible and recommend this product 100%, it had worked for me and I will continue to order.</li>
            <li> I am near 40 with fair skin, and I am blonde, with blonde eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Its alright, but I liked this stuff I got a few months ago.</li>
            <li> you want instant, safe, and professional results go to the doctor.</li>
            <li> During and immediately following my pregnancy they became very distinct.</li>
            <li> For hydroquinone serum, if you have not reached desired results after first treatment, allow a week of rest before initiating new treatment.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The amount of serum for the price is good, compared to other similar products.</li>
            <li> In the past I used products like hydroquinone ranging from 6% to 12%, AHA, and BHA and using these products alone or together was a disaster and caused even more damage!</li>
            <li> I know you&#x27;ve probably heard it a million times, but sunscreen is crucial to skin health, ESPECIALLY if you&#x27;re using a product as strong as this one!</li>
            <li> If my new skin is pink, then I skip a day to allow more healing.</li>
            <li> I have a slight case of melasma and with this cream I&#x27;ve been able to really keep it under control.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The most important reason I&#x27;m giving it 5 stars at this point is because the product does not break out my skin at all (which I&#x27;ve had a problem with in all the other skin lightening formulations I&#x27;ve tried) nor does it dry my skin out or cause irritation.</li>
            <li> this is amazing and i am not sure if this serum should get all the credit or not.</li>
            <li> The serum made mi dark spots darker and now they look more notecible.</li>
            <li> After another 5 days of using the product, most dark spots started to fade.</li>
            <li> the initial peeling I had in the first 5 to 7 days is pretty much gone.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think I just waited money on, yey, another product that didn&#x27;t live up to it&#x27;s claim!</li>
            <li> (I didn&#x27;t have a more recent clear pic, mostly because I&#x27;ve been hiding from the camera the past four years).</li>
            <li> Mild redness is also expected as the normal skin renewing process, as the active ingredients are effectively penetrating into the deeper layers of the skin and targeting skin discoloration to its core.</li>
            <li> My cheek looked awesome two weeks later, but literally a month later, the dark spot came back! ...</li>
            <li> and I used up more than half a bottle, hoping that it will eventually work.</li>
            <li> Decent product considering the price.</li>
            <li> I used this product on a particularly stubborn sun spot that I&#x27;ve had on my cheek for years.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I am noticing is that I am experiencing some dryness, redness and peeling while using the product, so I am giving my skin a few days break and using a good moisturizer to let it heal then</li>
            <li> It works, slowly but surely!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Procelain since the last week of June, and have found it to be more effective than two other previous products.</li>
            <li> I do recommend using a high SPF sunblock while using this product for maximum results.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone suffering from hyperpigmentation.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY recommend.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this.  </li>
            <li> I do highly recommend that you do not expose yourself to sunlight during the course of using the product as I did notice that this causes dis-coloration.</li>
            <li> Maybe after the second peel it comes back lighter and maybe, I am hoping after a few treatments it really disappears and I a happy</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I had really high hopes for this product with all</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> do not have to clean your face with alcohol as long as is clean.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do not mean that Il even feel it burning</li>
            <li> This product helped to reduce the appearance of some of my problem areas pretty quickly considering the other products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Excited about my new complexion, I got a little ahead of myself and exfoliated with my supersonic spin brush and had to stop using the serum for a bit because the strong exfoliating irritated the area, so don&#x27;t make the same mistake I did!!</li>
            <li> The customer service was great with this company but unfortunately this did not work for me in treating melasma.  </li>
            <li> However, just because it has natural ingredients does not make it gentle, the hydroquinone outweighs any of the perceived safer ingredients.</li>
            <li> The most important thing to remember is when you are using a skin fading product use sun screen protector of at least 35 and apply 2 to 3 times a day if you are outside.</li>
            <li> I did have a moderate amount of peeling and redness, but completely worth it.  </li>
            <li> It does peel off dead skin cells to reveal healthy skin cells and that&#x27;s the color you should expect to see.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> This is the first and only product I have found that really lightened my skin.</li>
            <li> I do my normal evening routing and use the product over my moisturizer, etc.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for two weeks and the brown spots on my upper lip have pretty much disappeared,</li>
            <li> Understand that I have used TONS of different products to try and get rid of my hyperpigmented scars, all without success.</li>
            <li> but I think that is normal.</li>
            <li> I have hyperpigmentation (HP) on top of my left eyebrow, and a little on the right side as well.</li>
            <li> Luckily, it will heel over time and possibly fade away to my natural skin tone, but until then I just have to wait and wait and wait...</li>
            <li> This helps your face look less shiny/ more matted and natural.  </li>
            <li> I know you&#x27;ve probably heard it a million times, but sunscreen is crucial to skin health, ESPECIALLY if you&#x27;re using a product as strong as this one!een before stepping out of my house in the morning.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t forget to use a strong broad-spectrum sunscreen when you go outside (even just for a short while) because otherwise your freckles or sunspots will return and be even darker!</li>
            <li> Suddenly I have hyper pigmentation on my right hand.</li>
            <li> but it came right back.  </li>
            <li> This office had about six different product lines on the shelf and the esthetican went right to Glytone Step</li>
            <li> This product uses a variety of ingredients that create a synergetic effect and they really work without lightening your face only in certain areas.</li>
            <li> - Gently brush face with a DRY (completely product free) general face or bronzer brush.  </li>
            <li> It goes on for a week or two (and people stare at my forehead), but then the new skin underneath is lighten and softer looking.</li>
            <li> I experienced major hyperpigmentation with my last pregnancy and while the majority of it faded within a year of my son being born, I am still left with a little on my forehead and on both cheeks.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how many dead skin cells that had cumulated on my face all these year.</li>
            <li> My face is glowing and very clear.  </li>
            <li> Some mild peeling occurred the first few times I used it, but not since.</li>
            <li> a copuple of brown spots on my face , one has gone completely , another one ( was a bit darker to start with) is still there but much lighter , and i still have more than half a bottle left .</li>
            <li> I used to get chemical peels every month and after almost a year, it did  get rid of a huge dark spot I had</li>
            <li> The darkness on my ears is completely gone!</li>
            <li> What can I say but thank to whoever developed this life saving product!</li>
            <li> I have had brown spots on my upper lip, it is VERY noticeable to me!</li>
            <li> I put it on that first night, and when I woke up the next morning, my face was peeling like a snake.</li>
            <li> So needless to say, I&#x27;m thrilled!  </li>
            <li> This is my first Amazon review, and the only reason I&#x27;m doing it is because I HAVE to give this product its Kudos.  </li>
            <li> the first ingredient is water the second is glycolic acid.  </li>
            <li> This product turned my skin slightly red within the first couple days of use.</li>
            <li> After using it for 10 days the spot was completely gone!  </li>
            <li> I gave up the sun over a year ago and with my skin returning to its natural color, boy did the sun damage show!</li>
            <li> My burn scar remains exactly the same.</li>
            <li> Specifically for me through my years of that for my skin type (milk chocolate), I have noticed that any type of alcohol doesn&#x27;t agree with my skin and does cause it to become even more darkened or yield no change; tea tree oil is no better.</li>
            <li> ( and yes I love myself, I just love glowing skin, so don&#x27;t get it twisted)....!</li>
            <li> At first I was seeing a big difference in my post acne marks</li>
            <li> It worked but made my skin so oily not to mention the nearly $600 price tag per month!</li>
            <li> Yes your skin will peel off getting rid of the old skin and bringing in the new skin.  </li>
            <li> I had a huge hyperpigmentation issue that I could not keep hidden under make up.  </li>
            <li> far as application itself - it definitely stings quite a bit when you first put it on, but that stinging goes away after about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> I am a dark skinned female &amp; I love the skin I&#x27;m in.</li>
            <li> This product should have more hydroquinone in it, especially for people with darker than average knees and elbows.</li>
            <li> It is just as expensive as other products I have tried but far more effective.</li>
            <li> It is good to note that my melasma is due to excessive sun exposure and even using the sun block doesn’t</li>
            <li> A large brownish spot on my left arm has noticeably faded using this.</li>
            <li> It stings a little at first but the affects on the skin were evident..</li>
            <li> I had super dark almost black melasma on my neck and as a very white skinned person it looked more like a hickey...</li>
            <li> The acne locations heal to clear skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I decided to use it and found that it not only lightened up those huge facial scars, but also gave me back my self-esteem!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice much difference with regards to lightening of dark marks on my face still halfway on my first bottle</li>
            <li> but I really dislike the old lady smell and greasy feel and would not use it religiously enough for long-term results.</li>
            <li> The upper lip melasma is really terrible....making me so self conscious.</li>
            <li> spots going going wow</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased two bottles so far and have had no side effects.</li>
            <li> have just used for 3 days so far, I will await a month or so before upgrading my ratings</li>
            <li> I will keep using it until they are completely gone.</li>
            <li> I thought OK, at least it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> WOW.</li>
            <li> So far I haven&#x27;t had any peeling or redness.</li>
            <li> so I do not feel self conscious about myself.</li>
            <li> wow.  </li>
            <li> My 34 year old daughter and I (age 60) used this product for two weeks and did feel a tingling sensation while applying it.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> and I have had them for twenty years or so because I was not using sun screen so much when I was younger.</li>
            <li> Overall, they don&#x27;t standout on my face as much as before.</li>
            <li> I would also say that the overall appearance of my skin is much improved since I&#x27;ve been using this.</li>
            <li> I started using this product along with ROC product and WOW.</li>
            <li> Within 2 or 3 days I noticed marked lightening of the areas I wanted to treat.</li>
            <li> but I have notice it does make any area you applied sensitive to sunlight.</li>
            <li> daystar.&lt;br /&gt;The product doesn&#x27;t get rid of it completely</li>
            <li> and I guess I am too sensitive.</li>
            <li> and it is working for me, so far.</li>
            <li> The serum is non-greasy, it absorbs completely into my skin so</li>
            <li> So with this regimen, I will be completely avoiding products that contain them.    </li>
            <li> I got it early which is a plus</li>
            <li> So far, no peeling yet.</li>
            <li> Oh, I have sensitive combination skin.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m nearly 3 weeks into using this product, and it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> I use a shade lighter than what naturally blends with my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t feel like people can even notice the discoloration that I was so self conscious about.  </li>
            <li> was that I also have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend to the person with sensitive skin since this one somewhat irritates during the process.</li>
            <li> We all have different skin types and I found something that really works for me.</li>
            <li> and I have been using the serum for about three weeks now and already see a marked difference.</li>
            <li> I would not advise anyone with sensitive skin to try this product.</li>
            <li> I do not consider my skin to be sensitive</li>
            <li> It took a whole bottle but if you don&#x27;t use sunscreen it&#x27;ll come back darker than before!</li>
            <li> So far this product seems to be lightening the spots I got during a stress breakout.</li>
            <li> Not working for me at all soo far ..</li>
            <li> I was left with these very unattractive scars on my face.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin i WOULD NOT recommend using this product.</li>
            <li> I have a skin condition called hyperpigmation, purchased the product that promises that it is a professional strength product that works to correct hyperpigmation</li>
            <li> It takes of the dead skin which can appear to make the area more red, but through continued uses, it will lighten up.</li>
            <li> I finally have my melasma under control ( at least the visible aspect of it, now the hormonal is another aspect on its own)  </li>
            <li> I needed a little help with dark pigmentation after no sun protection for most of my outdoor life and it&#x27;s working!</li>
            <li> Like I mentioned earlier, the product is quite potent and makes your skin peel, therefore I&#x27;ve only been using it every other night (sometimes every two nights) to give my skin a bit of a break from the irritation.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical that this product would work, but the reviews were pretty good and the price was reasonable</li>
            <li> For those with super sensitive skin I will add that there can be a slight peeling on affected areas</li>
            <li> I have many dark spots on my upper cheeks after I had my second child.</li>
            <li> Noticeable softness in complexion is achieved in just two days with dark marks fading and the overall complexion blending into a smooth hue.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update: I finished the first bottle, but after a lapse in use my melasma came back again,  I purchased a second bottle</li>
            <li> I was afraid that if it was too strong or more like a peel, i would wake up with red spots or blisters on my face and chin.  </li>
            <li> I have spots on my upper lip, similar to another reviewer, and they made me very self conscious.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s worth a try if you struggle with dark spots and melasma.</li>
            <li> Not only are the dark spots significantly lighter, but my skin also looks brighter, tighter and healthier.</li>
            <li> The first night I applied it as directions told me, and not much happened..</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m almost 40 years old with fair skin prone to freckling, melanoma, and an irritating tendency to break out with acne if I don&#x27;t keep it carefully under control.</li>
            <li> did more good than this - sorry!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m gonna skip a day to give my skin a chance to calm down</li>
            <li> Definitely worth a try if you are feeling mortified by discoloration due to the sun induced melasma!  </li>
            <li> I have had a large developing brown spot on my forehead for the last several years.</li>
            <li> There is slight redness and peeling next day after use, but I&#x27;ve noticed a significant lighting of the melasma in just three weeks of use-once per day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this new product for 4 days</li>
            <li> but, I experienced darkened and reddened areas on the few spots on my face that I applied it making them look much worse.</li>
            <li> I will be the happiest old woman with clear white porcelain skin on earth.</li>
            <li> The spots are not completely gone, but significantly faded to where make-up covers it up very well, and that&#x27;s after only treating it for about 2 weeks, whereas the other stuff didn&#x27;t do anything after 8 weeks of religious use!!</li>
            <li> Melasma is very stubborn and I have learned that you MUST wear sunscreen even for the five minutes that you will be outside regardless if it is sunny or not especially in the summer months!!  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t think I used long enough need to use consistently</li>
            <li> When you get within that range they are still very apparent.  </li>
            <li> but nothing major</li>
            <li> My complexion is a shade lighter, and I barely have blemishes!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using porcelain skin whitening serum for the last two weeks and WOW!</li>
            <li> I use it every night with no other products.</li>
            <li> What works on dark or dry skin might not work so well on light or oily skin...</li>
            <li> I actually used this with a cosmetic surgeon monitoring  the progess (mild dark spots) and he saw no difference.</li>
            <li> I am being very careful to use a good SPF whenever I&#x27;m in the sun too because I know that will make it worse.  </li>
            <li> I have tried peels and used hydroquinone in the past and they have all been a little effective in gradually fading my spots.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist advised me medications ranged from mild to strong whitening serum, cream and gel, none of them worked so far very expensive one (30 ml for 200$) .&lt;br</li>
            <li> The product is strong and I use a very small amount on the hyperpigmented areas...</li>
            <li> If you purchase the serum, definitely purchase a high SPF sunblock to wear regularly as well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what the long term use will yield, but in the short run I&#x27;ve noticed my skin tone evening out and my skin becoming a little clearer.  </li>
            <li> Got dis product and within 1 week my face began to clear up and at 3rd week</li>
            <li> it can maintain a clear white porcelain skin.  </li>
            <li> After 8 weeks of use, I can barely see it anymore.</li>
            <li> the only natural sunscreen, all the others are chemicals...</li>
            <li> and I have no regrets.</li>
            <li> and i can barely see difference....</li>
            <li> me one of their products because they spent so much time explaining the skin and how it gets harmed from the sun and what to do about it.  </li>
            <li> so you have to be careful with how much you use and where.</li>
            <li> , that&#x27;s probably where I applied it too much, so I need to be careful.</li>
            <li> Now they are barely visible at all.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it a week so far, but I&#x27;ll try to update after it&#x27;s been a while.</li>
            <li> I am 58 years old and my skin was showing sun worshipping damage in a big way.</li>
            <li> so much I barely see traces of it.  </li>
            <li> Only product so far that does what it says.</li>
            <li> The melasma aged me a lot and really bothered me.</li>
            <li> you barely feel it and</li>
            <li> This product lightened my sister&#x27;s dark melasma with first use.  </li>
            <li> did not really see any real effect.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have melasma on my upper lip which made me self conscious.</li>
            <li> In many cases, it makes things worse.  </li>
            <li> The serum is Ok, not great</li>
            <li> was kind of skeptical about purchasing the product to begin with since I had never heard of the brand.</li>
            <li> The drug store products now get absorbed into my skin since they are no longer blocked by the dead skin cells.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> Now three weeks have gone by, I have noticed darkening of my skin in areas where, I repeatedly tried more than a thin layer of serum.</li>
            <li> Within the first wk I started seeing some slight peeling.  </li>
            <li> If I happen to get caught outside on a particularly sunny day, I know Im going to see the brown marks the next day, but they seem to fade over the next day or two if I use this consistently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an African American woman early 50&#x27;s who&#x27;s developed moderate hyperpigmentation.  </li>
            <li> Living in Las Vegas where the sun is all the time it&#x27;s hard to avoid the sun, but with this cream I can enjoy myself again outside.</li>
            <li> I was very self conscious about it, and tried a few creams, but it seemed it was here to stay.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used all different kinds of creams and lotions and by far, finally I have found the one that truly delivers.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get my face back to rosy and soft before I had my second child.</li>
            <li> I had developed pretty severe melasma on my forehead over the past year.</li>
            <li> The second night I decided to use a little more this time because maybe i&#x27;d used too little.</li>
            <li> started seeing a little improvement within the first week.</li>
            <li> Summer is here and even though I use Broad Spectrum SPF 110 Sunscreen Lotion the Melasma spots are BACK!!!  </li>
            <li> I have spent hundreds of dollars on high end products which I won&#x27;t name</li>
            <li> My skin peeled off and revealed new pink skin with no grey!!!</li>
            <li> Prior to this, I was very self conscious about my skin because my hyper pigmentation was very dark and purple.</li>
            <li> I like this product so much because it is helping remove the dark spots and melasma on my face.</li>
            <li> I also was surprised that the product has lasted as long as it has.</li>
            <li> the first  few night after I applied  the serum</li>
            <li> applied this serum on dark spots only, and I put the other product on whole area of skin.&lt;br /&gt;long story short, it really works.</li>
            <li> At that time, I developed some of the dry flaking as indicated may occur in the instructions.</li>
            <li> but this was an amazingly fast inexpensive treatment for me and as a black woman that&#x27;s saying a lot.</li>
            <li> After a few days I notice the HP gotten darker and stands out more than it usually does.</li>
            <li> I started with IPL&#x27;s not very good success.</li>
            <li> It really works and it&#x27;s not as expensive as I used to pay for many other similar products that I purchased before.</li>
            <li> i put a small amount above my lips (right under my nose is where my melasma i  )</li>
            <li> I decided to try this product because it had good reviews and was way less expensive than the lazar treatments.</li>
            <li> I mean I got results after the very first use</li>
            <li> I HAD major melasma on my cheeks, forehead and chin - my skin is not completely clear, but</li>
            <li> skin had this hyperpigmentation condition and it was super dark, until I seen a picture from a previous user.</li>
            <li> After almost 2 weeks of use my dark spots have nearly vanished!!</li>
            <li> My wife has melasma on her face due to sun exposure,  Right after my wife started applying this skin whitening solution, I am seeing the pigmentation slowly going away and seeing the skin getting normal color and getting smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent so much money seeing dermatologist, and trying other products.  </li>
            <li> The skin where I apply the product darkens slightly the next day, then peels off revealing lighter, new skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been doing facial waxing since I was 17 years old and over the years this has damaged my skin drastically, creating dark patches in my upper lip and cheeks area after my pregnancy.</li>
            <li> a skeptic - nothing had worked so far, I I had given other products MONTHS to produce results.</li>
            <li> I figured that since it included some natural ingredients, it would be a gentler/safer option compared to other lightening products on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This product contains hydroquinone with other natural ingredients for lightning skin.</li>
            <li> Even with the SPF 110 Sunscreen Lotion this really peels your face so you have the sun hitting your raw face.  </li>
            <li> Within 6 weeks, the black ugly patches had faded by 65% in my own opinion, I was using too much</li>
            <li> but after a month the only thing I am experiences is minor redness and brief burning when I apply it to my face.</li>
            <li> Perhaps the most painful experience was one visit to a dermatologist in Boca Raton, the lady took the photo of my face, told me she would have to an expert dermatologist in New York to have a look, I knew she was upto something because she said she has &amp;</li>
            <li> and it was a little red for a few days, but for me it was worth it.</li>
            <li> Even if this does not end up lightening my melanoma/freckles, I&#x27;ll likely keep using it as my single nightly topical treatment since it acts quite well as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Moisturizer would just sit on my face and become sticky and greasy.&lt;br /&gt;After 12 days of using this product on my cheeks and upper cheeks, I saw some minor peeling.</li>
            <li> just so I can say that I did use it long enough for seeing results.</li>
            <li> Maybe I haven&#x27;t used it long enough.</li>
            <li> I was put on hormone replacement a couple of years ago and developed melasma around my mouth, my chin and down the side of both cheeks.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used prescription products through my dermatologist for a few years but decided to try something new.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to accurately assess at this point in time as I have only been using this product about two weeks now.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not delivering as fast as I would like it, but melasma is difficult and I have never had fast results (even with prescription creams).</li>
            <li> There are still a few areas which were pretty dark, and are being stubborn, but I am hoping they too will lighten in time.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> it goes a long long way, I bought 6mons ago and still have so much left</li>
            <li> I have been trying to exfoliate once a week so that the product can get deep down, and have religiously been using a face lotion with zinc in it to protect against further sun damage.</li>
            <li> For anyone who has hyper pigmentation due to the same cause-- look no further you have found your pot of gold!</li>
            <li> Thankfully, for me the product is really gentle so, there weren&#x27;t any worse effects no other than the darkening of the area.</li>
            <li> and the next day it went from dark looking to red</li>
            <li> Four years ago I went on a trip to St Lucia and came back with two dark spots above my lip.</li>
            <li> Have been using the product twice daily as directed  for over a month and my one dark facial spot has not gotten any lighter.</li>
            <li> Im an African American female that wanted to correct some uneven tones in face.  </li>
            <li> people with acne or problematic and sensitive skin, this product may be harsh.</li>
            <li> My face still has a long way to go</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t burn, didn&#x27;t peel, didn&#x27;t turn pink or red.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how long the result will be.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s  long  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent hundreds of dollars going to medical spas and doctors trying to figure out what was happening to my face.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s helped me achieve what I&#x27;ve been wanting to get rid of for so long.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use it till end of earth as long</li>
            <li> I have seen a very slight change so far</li>
            <li> I would put it on a night and in the morning I would see a small portion of my skin peeling, but enough to just gently scrub of with my usual morning facial scrub</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive and I am not able to use this product anymore.</li>
            <li> I had some slight discomfort this morning (I apply right before bed), but it wasn&#x27;t bad and resolved quickly.</li>
            <li> cannot say that my decolorized skin tone is only caused by this product because I have been using it with the other whitening product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Pores are smaller, skin is soft to touch and my face no longer looks dull and lifeless.</li>
            <li> Apply a layer after you shower and let it dry.</li>
            <li> However i used it for acne since it makes my skin extremely dry.</li>
            <li> I can tell the difference, seams not even out my skin tone,and didn&#x27;t dry my face out or make it peel.</li>
            <li> Faded sun spots, even some of the hyper-pigmentation above my lip (which has been a big trouble spot for me.)</li>
            <li> I simply put a thin layer on at night and it really did the job.</li>
            <li> My nose area is the worst, and being honest, the darker spots there are not as improved as my cheek area, but I&#x27;m hoping that over time it will help to really reduce the spots.  </li>
            <li> So far I have noticed a few are lighter but not much..</li>
            <li> I use a high-number sunscreen every single day and apply the Porcelain serum at night, as instructed.  </li>
            <li> The dark and red spots are not as noticeable.</li>
            <li> Years of dark spots gone after only about a week.</li>
            <li> I have dark spots above my cheeks, I think it&#x27;s melonin?  </li>
            <li> I had some really dark spots and they look lighter but not entirely gone.  </li>
            <li> I am a dark skin african American woman and I have spent so much on other products for hyperpigmentation around my neck, this started to work</li>
            <li> Although I know that some of the ingredients, are dangerous, I also know that I have spent so much money on other products, which just did not work, that I was willing to give this a try.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have one small brown spot and have used this product for nearly 2 months but have not seen results yet.</li>
            <li> I have tried different whitening serums and creams but with not much success.</li>
            <li> it left me with dark burn marks on about 80% of my face.</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t met my expectations so far, and I&#x27;ve been using it for the past 3 weeks now.</li>
            <li> I am a AA female that has been dealing with the effects of acne scarring &amp; dark spots for some time now.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what hit it, but I left a dark brose.</li>
            <li> I finally broke down and got prescription obagi and within a week, I&#x27;m already seeing the results.</li>
            <li> There was a little peeling and also minor tingling when applied, but, finally what a miracle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a young Caucasian trying to get rid of a few dark spots on my face and this product didn&#x27;t help in any way.</li>
            <li> only caution that I would say is to not put any serum on small open cuts, as it will sting and can cause a scar, in which this will eventually get rid of again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used Porcelana-- a different product-- for the past year and saw a tiny bit of fade</li>
            <li> I have been using the product for about 3 weeks and my skin has fewer visible brown spots/blotchiness and overall looks less sun damaged.</li>
            <li> I have been using the product for about a month and see some difference, however it is only slight.</li>
            <li> I have used many different fade creams and have been disappointed in the results.</li>
            <li> I still have about half the bottle left.</li>
            <li> /&gt;BTW, after about a half hour, I put some German-made Nivea cream on the spot, which I&#x27;ve read is similar to La Mer creams.</li>
            <li> and I only saw a slight difference on my skin.  </li>
            <li> :  (following up again) I am so glad that this product is in my arsenal kit for this melasma condition.  </li>
            <li> It took a few weeks to see results but it faded my dark spots ..and erased some completely.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a month now and only notice a slight lightening, but I still can see the brown patches (melasma).&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li> before i used this serum i had severe acne- all day every single day!</li>
            <li> I noticed a dramatic improvement within the first week of use.  </li>
            <li> I had a dark mark on my face due to acne pimple which i popped and left a scar</li>
            <li> Yes, my skin is a little leather-y and red</li>
            <li> but my skin is a little red and peeling.</li>
            <li> and I saw results in a little over a week with daily use.  </li>
            <li> but I have only been using it for a little over a month.</li>
            <li> I noticed the next day my hyperpigmentation seemed a little faded.</li>
            <li> i put it on there is a light burning sensation, nothing too painful and redness when i wake up the next morning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve literally spent hundreds of dollars on products that produce zero results.</li>
            <li> but there was absolutely no result.</li>
            <li> After three weeks of use I am now only using this product a few times a week for maintenance.</li>
            <li> #34;never seen anything like this&amp;#34; few weeks later, she calle to say we can&#x27;t help you...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a fast process but it WORKS</li>
            <li> There has been a gradual lightening of skin spots and absolutely NO irritation.  </li>
            <li> i spent a lot of my for my dermatologist</li>
            <li> However, this product is really helping diminish the spots I have and is keeping them from getting worse.</li>
            <li> It lightened the center areas of the spots as well.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions carefully and it did not work for me.</li>
            <li> It did NOT work as quickly as I expected but over time, I am seeing a difference.</li>
            <li> I probably have spent close to $10,000 on face products alone</li>
            <li> Been using it everyday, but see a very tiny difference and its been a month.</li>
            <li> The results are minimal.</li>
            <li> I have only had this for a few days but can tell that it is doing the job.</li>
            <li> but I expected that.</li>
            <li> but it was expected.</li>
            <li> But, ultimately, I couldn&#x27;t get over the fact the the presentation made me not trust the product, and Iit made me nervous putting it on my skin everyday, so I chose to stop using it.</li>
            <li> just enough to feel a tingle (which subsides after a few minutes).</li>
            <li> Of course, I&#x27;ve been using tons of sunscreen and have been wearing a wide rimmed hat when I can.</li>
            <li> I expected to be seeing results because it claimed that the brown spots I have on my face would start to diminish</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few weeks now close to a month and my severe discoloration on my neck and chest is starting to fade away.</li>
            <li> Keep in mind when using this product that the affected area may get worse (in my case much worse) before it starts to get better.</li>
            <li> I had my hopes up so high after reading many reviews, now I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> My dark spots didn&#x27;t turn lighter and it actually got slightly darker in one spot.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for 10 days on my melasma spots and they are only about half as dark as before.</li>
            <li> I am half Caucasian, half Asian, and 41, if that&#x27;s a helpful barometer.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the area where peeled the most also slowly turned dark.</li>
            <li> I notices the dark spots finally disappearing within a few days after using it.</li>
            <li> , it really does work, the brown spots are very faint now, in another two weeks they&#x27;ll be completely gone.</li>
            <li> I have missed a few nights off and on but overall I do notice a decrease in the dark spots.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The color of my dark DARK, stubborn acne blemishes that have plagued my checks are now breaking down and the color is fading from dark brown to now, reddish brown in only 4 days!</li>
            <li> This is not a good product if you have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> It is probably not good for people with sensitive skin; it does have a stinging sensation after application.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other solutions, spending thousands of dollars in an attempt to remove the melasma.&lt;br /&gt;Procelain</li>
            <li> This product worked for my hyperpigmentation when other products didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> and so the areas got darkened and delayed the brightening due to too much/repeated peeling</li>
            <li> I use the serum every other day, and the days I&#x27;m not using it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it is working for a lot other people, but I&#x27;m afraid not for me!</li>
            <li> Other factors that may have helped my acne issues.</li>
            <li> Used the ingredients in other products</li>
            <li> Glycol: acts as humectant, preservative, &amp; stabilizer; can enhance penetration of other ingredients</li>
            <li> The skin looks rough and dark.</li>
            <li> I took away 1 star due to the price of this product.</li>
            <li> I have used complexion soaps and cremes in the past, hoping I wouldn&#x27;t have to go further</li>
            <li> I have had hyper-pigmentation due to the results of prescribed acne medications from dermatologists and even with the direction to use sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I started using this product every night, however, I use it every other night to every two nights now.</li>
            <li> wrote this review as a thank you to all the other reviews/postings I poured over when I was searching for ANYTHING that would help.</li>
            <li> However, I was hoping the other ingredients in the serum, that I had seen in my research, would make a difference.  </li>
            <li> I have used hydroquinone off and on over the years as well as other prescription products with no luck.  </li>
            <li> I will throw away all the other products that don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I definitely am not pleased with  this purchase and although I did not send it back my friend said it worked for her</li>
            <li> I notice a slight lightening to my dark patches of melasma, but not significant enough to stop using foundation.</li>
            <li> It did not cause any pealing for me, it did make my skin a little dry at times but a moisturizer helped with that.</li>
            <li> The list of ingredients does not provide the percentages of the active ingredients.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately did not see nearly the same results.</li>
            <li> Kinda burned and irritated my skin but that as because it has active ingredients that go below your outer skin layer</li>
            <li> I had soooo much dead skin which was causing my face to have an overall uneven apperance.</li>
            <li> but when i applied this product it burned immensely every time and actually made my skin worse.</li>
            <li> However, it has already lightened dark spots due to sun and acne scars.  </li>
            <li> since i have used this i have not had one single pimple!!!</li>
            <li> You will notice the dark spots begin to gradually fade as your skin begins to peel and the active ingredients penetrate your skin.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> After only 2 weeks, I&#x27;ve had dramatic results such that I&#x27;ve just canceled my dermatology appointment.</li>
            <li> but they are deep &amp; hard to fade.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my late 20s but grew up in Florida with no sunscreen usage and occasional tanning bed usage.  </li>
            <li> I use the Procelain as the acne begins to heal and the dark spots don&#x27;t ever truly develop.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for two months now and do see a gradual lightning of dark spots.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use foundation anymore to cover the dark spots.  </li>
            <li> If this product did anything, it made my dark marks on my face Darker.</li>
            <li> I used this whitening serum and it lightened up my dark spots.</li>
            <li> I have dark spots from pregnancy and acne as well.</li>
            <li> But after using it for quite a while, there was no difference to my dark scars.</li>
            <li> It reduces the immediate skin dark spots but they are still noticeable from 5+ feet away.  </li>
            <li> it has been helping with the dark spots on my face.  </li>
            <li> I bought this because of the rave that it would help with my hyper pigmentation and dark spots/circles.</li>
            <li> my skin is really dark</li>
            <li> Itakes time to work on dark spots</li>
            <li> so this has all the ingredients i researched online that would help lighten dark spots</li>
            <li> I have some dark dark spots on my face.</li>
            <li> I was diagnosed with melasma which is like a dark mask on the face.</li>
            <li> But then I started looking up products that could help to wipe this dark, mustache looking thing away since I&#x27;ve had for five years.</li>
            <li> Every morning when I wake up, I set my alarm an hour before my boyfriend&#x27;s so I can rush to cover my dark spots and burned skin up because I just can&#x27;t let him see me this way.</li>
            <li> have not seen any results with this product on my dark</li>
            <li> I need something stronger and faster to remove dark spots from my legs.</li>
            <li> except it&#x27;s a dark botch of skin.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t do much of anything, sadly.</li>
            <li> Went to the dermatologist for freckles and dark spots on my face was perscribed medicated cream and with my insurace would cost me over 180$.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this product would help just dark spots</li>
            <li> This product does not work for dark spots or pigmentation.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have dark skin</li>
            <li> My dermatologist told me I have a skin condition know as Malasma which leaves dark areas of the skin...</li>
            <li> (The return factor with melasma is one of the most annoying traits.)</li>
            <li> I hate the top of my foot.</li>
            <li> Or do i need to slow down by using it alternate days or one week 2 to 3 times</li>
            <li> Hyperpigmentation goes way down into the skin almost like a scar and takes weeks to get rid of.  </li>
            <li> It has not irritated or peeled my skin in an extreme manner, it seems to work in a gradual way, leaving the skin  moist without drying it!</li>
            <li> It seems the biggest part of the dark spot in my face is removed , but there are some small small tiny spots scattered</li>
            <li> I have seen a dramatic decrease in my old acne scars AND in the amount of cystic breakouts I get.</li>
            <li> all black spots sufferers TRY IT</li>
            <li> Usted this product continually for two months and half and didn&#x27;t experience any immediate redness or peeling.</li>
            <li> : There is a slight tingling and some peeling</li>
            <li> my freckles are much less noticeable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it is a lot less noticeable then before.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a black man who had severe acne as a teenager.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for three days and my skin is a half shade lighter.</li>
            <li> One bottle typically lasts about 1 month depending on size of brown spots.</li>
            <li> The only recommendation that I have is when using this serum only use it in the troubled area because it will lighten up your skin</li>
            <li> I also am peeling slightly</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;smoother and slightly clearer.</li>
            <li> This is less that 1 week i am using.  </li>
            <li> I have some slight redness going on</li>
            <li> I got results after about a week and a half of trying the Porcelain serum.</li>
            <li> I have had a dark age spot on my cheek for a few years now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve paid for very expensive solutions from doctors and did not feel they were worth the money.</li>
            <li> The serum was not super harsh on my skin.</li>
            <li> When the skin peels off, it leaves a laceration (at least for me), then your skin to red and hurts pretty bad.</li>
            <li> I was a little apprehensive to purchase this product</li>
            <li> can still see a little but will try to use more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does have a little sting to it but nothing unbearable.</li>
            <li> I was expecting change to come a little faster</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a little over a week</li>
            <li> It may fade a little</li>
            <li> /&gt;Firstly, let me give a little insight to my skin type.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This whitening serum seemed a little over-priced</li>
            <li> It did burn a little when I put on</li>
            <li> Has everything drs prescribed but in on little jar instead of 3 tubes.</li>
            <li> Helps a little, but not like I thought it would.</li>
            <li> I peeled a little without breaking out.</li>
            <li> It taking a little longer to work ...</li>
            <li> I am a 53 year old Asian woman with medium skin tone and I wear make up foundation to cover my ugly dark spots</li>
            <li> I went to the dermatologist &amp; he per scrimped the cream, I used it off &amp; on &amp; just was down right frustrated</li>
            <li> After a time of all of that, my skin is sensitive and I have multiple areas of bad skin discolorations.</li>
            <li> I have seen results from this product after a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money and hoping for miracle.</li>
            <li> I am a caramel colour in skin tone and bought this product to lighten the spots on my bikini line left behind by razor bumps.</li>
            <li> I wasted my money buying this product.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s waste of money.</li>
            <li> To see results you have to use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I have had melasma on my forehead for a few years.  </li>
            <li> But this product lightens them up within a few days.  </li>
            <li> After using it for a few weeks, the spots were virtually gone.</li>
            <li> and I put on my sunblock everyday.  </li>
            <li> It would be terribly worse if I did not use it daily.  </li>
            <li> Noticed fading within a few days.</li>
            <li> I have had severe melasma for a few years.</li>
            <li> I will try to post again after a few months.</li>
            <li> My skin above my lip looks worse than before.</li>
            <li> Acid: alpha hydroxy acid; removes outer layer of dead skin cells on surface of skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I cant wait until the day, I dont need to wear heavy make-up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 44 and have been trying to get rid an age spot under my eye for a few years now.  </li>
            <li> It was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> waste of money dont buy</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t wastes money on this product.</li>
            <li> Not too harsh.  </li>
            <li> but you do see results in two weeks, however adding this to the mix my face is whiter, brighter, and I had a few guys staring.</li>
            <li> and you do not want to have an uneven skin tone.</li>
            <li> Just a few spots</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> I use a small amount of raw shea butter before applying a small amount (thin layer) of the serum, in order to, sooth and protect my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m super desperate!</li>
            <li> I have had brown patches on my pale skin since I started having children 25 years ago.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m too pale to notice a result, but I saw no improvement at all.</li>
            <li> Seeing these dark patches on my upper lip even after waxing, sometime it made it worse!</li>
            <li> It was so bad people would tell me I had dirt on my face nearly every day due to having nearly black splotches from malasma.  </li>
            <li> It is slowly fading my dark brown melasma patches.</li>
            <li> I have melasma above my upper lip and before it wasn&#x27;t that bad, I would put some make-up over it and go on with my day.</li>
            <li> It peels off some of my &amp;#34;dead skin&amp;#34; I guess, but I advise customers to do this over vacation or when you have time to camp out at home for a week because this stuff makes your skin peel like crazy, so crazy that even make-up may not be able to cover it.</li>
            <li> My pigmented area has faded slowly after three and half weeks.</li>
            <li> I already have dry skin and using it made my skin worse.</li>
            <li> Seriously, my nose looks like someone painted on a brown spotted cow.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m black with darks marks from some moles I had to remove and because the idiot doctor didn&#x27;t a skin test on me first, so he decided to freeze the moles off instead of burning them.</li>
            <li> My neck will now need serious repair, my underarms are darker as well but not as dark as how my neck has become.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also suffered chronically from adult hormonal acne for about 5 years, which has left me in a constant battle against deep, painful cystic breakouts and the ugly scars they leave behind.</li>
            <li> I have seen very little difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li> I had bad melasma on my forehead but didnt really mind.</li>
            <li> Not sure as I have not seen any results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not healthy, and it doesn&#x27;t always work.  </li>
            <li> Do it everyday and you&#x27;ll see results!    </li>
            <li> I will update in a few months on the progress!</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s helpful for melasma.</li>
            <li> it worked, I noticed a difference in just a few weeks!</li>
            <li> Although my skin is not completely flawless this product has lightened the scars enough</li>
            <li> Im not sure</li>
            <li> waste of time and money!</li>
            <li> Was told to allow 6 weeks before noticing any difference in pigmentation  Not sure I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> A small amount of skin peeling occurred as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not sure if it works but def.</li>
            <li> I have not noticed excessive peeling, redness or irritation.</li>
            <li> For your skin protection, avoid excessive sun exposure and always use sunscreen before and during sun exposure when using treatment.</li>
            <li> The product exfoliated my skin IN THE TROUBLE spots with just one use!</li>
            <li> I stopped using the serum when small areas on each side of my mouth lost color.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if it lightens my spots, I didn&#x27;t take before pics</li>
            <li> I have some brown spots from a past pregnancy and sun damage, and was eager to find something to lighten them.</li>
            <li> /&gt; not satisfied</li>
            <li> I used to purchase this really expensive serum from a spa in California when I lived there that had similar ingredients.  </li>
            <li> I had read reviews about this product making conditions worse, but I decided to go with the positive reviews as I was desperate.</li>
            <li> The only other item that has worked for me besides this item was the Cosmelan treatment but very expensive</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve not experienced any other reactions.</li>
            <li> But not the dramatic results that I expected.</li>
            <li> It is very slow removing dark spots.  </li>
            <li> i can&#x27;t hardly believe it myself.</li>
            <li> As I age, they seemed to have become darker and it is getting hard to hide them with concealer under my makeup.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes,but now i am disappointed, so I give a couple weeks to see how is going to be.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only got 15-20% of the ugly dark pigmentation to go!</li>
            <li> I also went to Africa on mission and spent much time in the sun this made it worst.</li>
            <li> Amino acids, herbs and supplements take at least 3 months to saturate the system to work, and so do at lot of these face products.</li>
            <li> you need at least 2 weeks off work.</li>
            <li> the brown spots on my face have faded by at least 75%.  </li>
            <li> I do get usual pimples but that is not surprising.</li>
            <li> My skin is delicate perioral area, but it product exfoliates my skin</li>
            <li> I was late in receiving it..</li>
            <li> and i was thinking to find a surgery to remove the skin even though i know it is not practically possible but look how bad and frustrated was my situation that I was seeking for anything which is promising to heal this issue.</li>
            <li> This is slowly taking care of it, but I admit I don&#x27;t expect a miracle.  </li>
            <li> Works slowly</li>
            <li> Im not really in love with the idea of blasting my face (and brain) with lasers, so I figured rubbing on some (possibly) toxic chemicals was the lesser evil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to get rid of that mustache look, which isn&#x27;t hair (usually!)</li>
            <li> The price point is unbelievable and what it&#x27;ll do for your face will amaze you!</li>
            <li> However, that&#x27;s very expensive and my melasma came back with sun exposure.</li>
            <li> so im not trying to whiten my face, just get rid of this ridiculous look</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried expensive products and even having them lasered off, with little to no results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little expensive if you ask me.</li>
            <li> Ill keep using it till I run out, then maybe find something a little stronger.</li>
            <li> When I came back for my vacation my melasma got so bad</li>
            <li> Secondly, it burns soooo bad.</li>
            <li> /&gt;this is not a good product.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re looking to make those ugly marks disappear, this is the only one you&#x27;ll ever need.</li>
            <li> I felt SO embarrassed about this since it started happening &amp; slowly getting worse.</li>
            <li> It is hardly even visible anymore!  </li>
            <li> PRICE SUCKS!</li>
            <li> I had several laser treatments for my brown spots which did not work , was very disappointed and wasted money</li>
            <li> Alas.</li>
            <li> Not Happy</li>
            <li> thing I want to point out is, apply thin layer on problematic area as instructed.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t feel tingling, check to see if the layer you applied is too thin.</li>
            <li> So when you use it, apply with a really thin layer.</li>
            <li> This made my hyperpigmentation worse.</li>
            <li> It can irritate the skin and can make sun-damaged spots worse.</li>
            <li> and i can see stubborn melasma is fading away, these melasma have been residing on my face and never welcome any types of lightening medication.  </li>
            <li> FOUND OUT THAT THE SUN CAN MAKE THE PROBLEM WORSE.</li>
            <li> It was irritating and it made my hyperpigmentation worse.</li>
            <li> For a majority of my adult life, I struggled with acne and hated my skin.</li>
            <li> I am not happy with this product and do not recommend its purchase.</li>
            <li> but, there are only very faint brown spots!  </li>
            <li> i dont like this product my melasma is more worst than before i hate this product</li>
            <li> , I just came from my doctor for a little botox and his Hydro-product was $53 for 2% ,  $110 for 4%  !!!!</li>
            <li> I was stupid to not do it, and now working through a couple of other products to help repair the damage.  </li>
            <li> so I waste a lot of it.  :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not impressed.</li>
            <li> Sorry</li>
            <li> but she said it will only make it worst!</li>
            <li> so well it&#x27;s scary</li>
            <li> Sadly, this product did not lighten my skin, in fact it darkened all the areas that it touched.</li>
            <li> My troubled areas are darker than ever.</li>
            <li> I am so sad.</li>
            <li> If I had the results I was going for why keep peeling my skin, maybe I&#x27;m wrong.  </li>
            <li> I literally had to camp in my house for almost a week because it can make your skin wrinkly in the process and looks weird when I tried to cover it up with make-up.</li>
            <li> (Frustrating!)</li>
            <li> and I have broken out all over my face.!  </li>
            <li> That is wrong.</li>
            <li> unless I underwent some expensive laser treatment, I was just going to have to accept that the melasma on my face was just a fact of life.</li>
            <li> and it is difficult to treat</li>
            <li> It works just as well and is not as expensive.  </li>
            <li> I will finish the bottle (because it was expensive), but I will not buy another.</li>
            <li> I was soooo really desperate that I&#x27;m like I seriously have nothing to lose!</li>
            <li> My ears were really dark and nasty looking from being pierced etc.</li>
            <li> Stinks too.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s peels like crazy.</li>
            <li> What drove me crazy is it affected my face and being a Mary Kay consultant selling beauty products...</li>
            <li> Terrible stuff, don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> This product literally burns the skin, it peels off, and unfortunately the skin underneath is charred!  </li>
            <li> My dermatologist said it was very unlikely that anything would help.  </li>
            <li> Then I hit the menopause and the condition got worst, the areas on my face got covered with very dark ugly patches around my cheek and eye area, and made my eye area looked like an owl!</li>
            <li> You feel bad about yourself and don&#x27;t even want people to look at you in the face.</li>
            <li> , Is it bad packaging and leeky?  </li>
            <li> BAD.</li>
            <li> Bad pump or not....  </li>
            <li> if I got a bad batch or something</li>
            <li> I do have to say my face is not as bad as before</li>
            <li> have a bad case of melanoma</li>
            <li> The label looks homemade, in a bad way (words cut off, etc).</li>

            <li> I m very much disappointed.</li>
            <li> Annoying.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pesky and annoying and just won&#x27;t go away after everything I&#x27;ve tried, as well as prescriptions.</li>
            <li> Broke me out horribly :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed!</li>

            <li> you won&#x27;t be disappointed!!!!</li>
            <li> I started to use hydroquinone to help lighten it but that made it worst</li>
            <li> It made my skin terrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for two weeks now but I&#x27;ve noticed a difference.  It seems to work.  I&#x27;ll give it another two weeks before I say I love it.</li>
            <li> ... and if it does, I hope it&#x27;s the treatable kind because I don&#x27;t plan on stopping.  This product is AMAZING! I don&#x27;t know what the long term use will yield, but in the short run I&#x27;ve noticed my skin tone evening out and my skin becoming a little clearer.  I&#x27;m in my late 20s but grew up in Florida with no sunscreen usage and occasional tanning bed usage.  I know the error of my ways now, but I have some damage to my skin in the form of some discolorations and two sunspots!  This is slowly taking care of it, but I admit I don&#x27;t expect a miracle.  What did surprise me is that this also reduced my milia.  I have teeny tiny bumps around my eyes (nothing as severe as what you get if you google milia) and this actually reduced them.  SIGNIFICANTLY.  I will be buying this regularly and hoping it doesn&#x27;t give me neurological damage, cancer, gout, or anything else that foundation can&#x27;t cover up.  **EDIT**  A while after writing the review above, I ordered another one of these and noticed that the formula has been changed.  It feels like they&#x27;ve weakened the concentration.  I&#x27;m not impressed.</li>
            <li> It did not work at all.  I am very disappointed</li>
            <li> I am so glad I found this product.  The top layer of my skin started peeling after the very first use and I saw result it looked like what&#x27;s left after a snake shred it&#x27;s skin.. I mean I got results after the very first use and I love the way the gel disappears after the application...all black spots sufferers TRY IT you won&#x27;t be disappointed!!!! Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> I decided to purchase this items after checking many positive reviews.&lt;br /&gt;I cannot say that my decolorized skin tone is only caused by this product because I have been using it with the other whitening product.&lt;br /&gt;However, it really boost whitening.&lt;br /&gt;I applied this serum on dark spots only, and I put the other product on whole area of skin.&lt;br /&gt;long story short, it really works.</li>
            <li> I give this product 5 stars for effectively lightening 50% of dark hyper-pigmentation on elbows in 2 weeks! Amazing, highly recommended for African-American skin!</li>
            <li> I absolutely recommend this product, my melasma went away 90%.&lt;br /&gt;The first two weeks I did not notice any change but, I continued used for a month and I started seen changes.&lt;br /&gt;Recommendations&lt;br /&gt;1. use sunblock that contains dioxide zinc or titanium always while treatment&lt;br /&gt;2. if you are going to be expose to the sun wear a hat&lt;br /&gt;3.evoid sun as much as you can while using it.&lt;br /&gt;4.you do not have to clean your face with alcohol as long as is clean.&lt;br /&gt; I have a very sensitive skin and during all treatment every night my skin got red and kind of hitching for 20 min but after that time went away.</li>
            <li> I used the product daily, at night.  Have been using it since May 17, 2013.  I have seen very little difference in my skin.  I purchased it because of the hyperpigmentation on my cheeks.  I will continue to use it and hope for the best.</li>
            <li> I have seen results from this product after a few weeks.  The dark and red spots are not as noticeable.</li>
            <li> I used this product for 1 1/2 months-- I didn&#x27;t see any improvement.  I do not recommend this product.  It is a lot easier to see your dermatologist and get an rX for the hydroquinone in a higher percentage to treat the melasma.</li>
            <li> this porcelain whitening wasn&#x27;t enough strength for hydroquinone.. I was use procelian its doesn&#x27;t help me anyway so. no plm</li>
            <li> I never believe reviews but everyone needs to know about this. Years of dark spots gone after only about a week. This stuff is awesome.</li>
            <li> Very helpful for sunspots or discoloration.  Some mild peeling occurred the first few times I used it, but not since.</li>
            <li> the product is working very well after two weeks of using it...yeaaa clean skin at last.worth it. spots going going wow</li>
            <li> When looking at the list of ingredients, you would assume this would work, however it did not work on my pesky Melasma. I finally broke down and got prescription obagi and within a week, I&#x27;m already seeing the results.</li>
            <li> I experienced major hyperpigmentation with my last pregnancy and while the majority of it faded within a year of my son being born, I am still left with a little on my forehead and on both cheeks. I have tried peels and used hydroquinone in the past and they have all been a little effective in gradually fading my spots. I decided to give this a try based on the many positive reviews....hmmm, I have seen no change and have been using this for over 40 days.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m beginning to wonder if many of the reviews were posted by the company selling the product rather than actually consumers. Annoying.</li>
            <li> I had several laser treatments for my brown spots which did not work , was very disappointed and wasted money so decided to give this serum a try . Have been using it for about 3 weeks .Had a copuple of brown spots on my face , one has gone completely , another one ( was a bit darker to start with) is still there but much lighter , and i still have more than half a bottle left . Hopefully , the second spot will disaapear as well .</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think this Hydroquinone kojic acid glyolic acid worked for my skin!</li>
            <li> do not notice much change in pigmentation after weeks of use.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work!!! Don&#x27;t waste your money and hoping for miracle.</li>
            <li> Usted this product continually for two months and half and didn&#x27;t experience any immediate redness or peeling. I dad contacted the company after one month of use to return it but the representative suggest to use it along another product of their for another month. However if this product is going to work it would have worked on its own, another month later still no change what so ever. I&#x27;m a young Caucasian trying to get rid of a few dark spots on my face and this product didn&#x27;t help in any way. Don&#x27;t waist you time and money. I had my hopes up so high after reading many reviews, now I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Im a caramel complected girl who&#x27;s suffered from uneven skin my whole life. I&#x27;ve literally spent hundreds of dollars on products that produce zero results.I was a little apprehensive to purchase this product but I figured I&#x27;d give it a try. The price was right and I&#x27;m super desperate! Shipping was excellent and very timely. Ok, now onto the product. I applied the light serum twice daily... always after I shower. I applied it to my face, elbows, knees, ears, and neck area. My ears were really dark and nasty looking from being pierced etc. The darkness on my ears is completely gone! The skin on my ears did peel (not badly) ive applied it under my eye area and haven&#x27;t noticed a difference..yet. I don&#x27;t see a change on my knees or elbows being these are the hardest areas to even out. The bottle lasted approx two weeks. I literally slept it in and didn&#x27;t take it off. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this product. It&#x27;s the only product that has worked for me in my 10 year skin brightening search. My only wish is that the bottle was larger. Will purchase again. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Does NOT work. Stinks too.</li>
            <li> Had melasma after the birth of my son. Got dis product and within 1 week my face began to clear up and at 3rd week, my face was bk to normal even better. I really appreciate dis product.</li>
            <li> I gave this product a try and although I never had any problems as some reviews had mentioned, I never had any results as well. I actually used this with a cosmetic surgeon monitoring  the progess (mild dark spots) and he saw no difference. No he wasnt trying to make a buck. I go to him for shots for a medical condition. I returned the product and will say they have great customer service.</li>
            <li> The customer service was great with this company but unfortunately this did not work for me in treating melasma.  But in all fairness, nothing I&#x27;ve tried has worked so it&#x27;s probably not a fault of the product.  I just convinced the melasma is a permanent flaw.</li>
            <li> I struggle with melasma.  I&#x27;ve tried other solutions, spending thousands of dollars in an attempt to remove the melasma.&lt;br /&gt;Procelain has worked.  There is slight redness and peeling next day after use, but I&#x27;ve noticed a significant lighting of the melasma in just three weeks of use-once per day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I struggle with hormonal acne.  I use the Procelain as the acne begins to heal and the dark spots don&#x27;t ever truly develop.  The acne locations heal to clear skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s worth a try if you struggle with dark spots and melasma.</li>
            <li> This is great for wrinkles, hyperpigmentation, scars, and so many other things because it reveals new skin completely.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for two months now and do see a gradual lightning of dark spots. The amount of serum for the price is good, compared to other similar products. Just be patient as it doesn&#x27;t work overnight.</li>
            <li> This Porcelain serum really works wonder on my face.  By using it for couple of days, I noticed the difference right away.  My face is glowing and very clear.  I even have compliment from my families and friends. I&#x27;m so happy with the outcome and would recommend it to everyone.  Just try it and you will never regret the result after couple of days.  To me, this is a miracle worker.  I don&#x27;t use foundation anymore to cover the dark spots.  They are gradually disappearing and I&#x27;m very content that there&#x27;s progress.</li>
            <li> I am a caramel colour in skin tone and bought this product to lighten the spots on my bikini line left behind by razor bumps. Did not work at all.</li>
            <li> It is ok. I don&#x27;t see nothing different on my skin</li>
            <li> This product WORKS for melasma. Only took a week to achieve desired results.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do as advertised.  Very disappointed in product.  I used according to instructions for 6 weeks on hands and face and there was absolutely change.  Won&#x27;t purchase again.  Suggest saving your money and trying another product.</li>
            <li> Broke me out horribly :( Not recommended.</li>
            <li> I wasted my money buying this product. I followed the instructions and didn&#x27;t see a change. I rated 1 ☆because it was an obligation but my real rate is 0. Sorry but it is the true.</li>
            <li> The delivery  was timely and excellent.</li>
            <li> It works, slowly but surely! Love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried IPL and had a good peel. Unfortunately, the area where peeled the most also slowly turned dark. Four weeks after peeling from the IPL treatment, the area had the most peel also turned the most pigmented. I really want to warn those of you who are considering IPL. I bought Procelain to give it a try. My pigmented area has faded slowly after three and half weeks. I will continue to finish the bottle and hope for the best.</li>
            <li> Love this serum. I am Asian, south east Asia, my skin is tan, I want to have bright tan face. I  noticed my skin is more bright , even and glowing just couple days using this product. really love this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used so many products that I&#x27;ve purchased at top stores such as Sephora and spent over $100s of dollars on name brands, in which they didn&#x27;t work!&lt;br /&gt;My skin had this hyperpigmentation condition and it was super dark, until I seen a picture from a previous user. I decided to use it and found that it not only lightened up those huge facial scars, but also gave me back my self-esteem!&lt;br /&gt;I am so super grateful for this product and it really does work wonders!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only caution that I would say is to not put any serum on small open cuts, as it will sting and can cause a scar, in which this will eventually get rid of again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really great product and in the future I will definitely purchase this again!</li>
            <li> Suddenly I have hyper pigmentation on my right hand. Many spots.&lt;br /&gt;I tried this products and 1 week later, I could see the difference!&lt;br /&gt;I can still see a little but will try to use more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additional review(9/3/13)&lt;br /&gt;I kept using this products 2 more weeks after the first review.&lt;br /&gt;My spots on my hand is all gone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: the container is very cheap. It&#x27;s understand b/c of this price. but I can&#x27;t push it so easy and always splash on my hand.&lt;br /&gt;I still have so much left. Don&#x27;t need so much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different products for my melasma. This product is working! It is slowly fading my dark brown melasma patches. But it causes quite a bit of peeling the next day after use. I only use it at night and now I religiously apply sunblock during the day.</li>
            <li> It did not work for me.</li>
            <li> Not sure as I have not seen any results. Still hopeful!</li>
            <li> If this product did anything, it made my dark marks on my face Darker. Thought it was worth a try *shrugs*</li>
            <li> I used it as directed. I did not feel any tingling sensation nor did I experience any peeling. Perhaps it is because I have darker brown skin that the product is not suited for me but there was absolutely no result.</li>
            <li> I bought this product on Feb, 8 and it arrived three days later. it came in the box in good condition no damage or anything. i was looking for a cream for my melasma and saw this product on Amazon. it has great reviews and that is reason i bought it, i am using it exactly like the instruction says. But there is no results yet my skin is still the same. I had high hopes,but now i am disappointed, so I give a couple weeks to see how is going to be.</li>
            <li> I have melasma and this is the only non-prescription product that has helped at all. It&#x27;s not delivering as fast as I would like it, but melasma is difficult and I have never had fast results (even with prescription creams). So I&#x27;ll keep using until it&#x27;s finished and I&#x27;ll evaluate the state of my spots. But so far, so good!</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.  It&#x27;s not healthy, and it doesn&#x27;t always work.  In many cases, it makes things worse.  This product contains 2% hydroquinone, which is a carcinogen , i.e. it causes cancer.    For details: [...]</li>
            <li> 5 stars. This product worked for my hyperpigmentation when other products didn&#x27;t.  It applies smooth and dries fast. I&#x27;ve purchased two bottles so far and have had no side effects.</li>
            <li> Best Whitening Cream To Treat Melesma. I&#x27;ve used all different kinds of creams and lotions and by far, finally I have found the one that truly delivers. I&#x27;ve been doing facial waxing since I was 17 years old and over the years this has damaged my skin drastically, creating dark patches in my upper lip and cheeks area after my pregnancy. In search of looking for something that would truly deliver what it promise and doing my homework online, making sure the ingredients are natural as possible and recommend this product 100%, it had worked for me and I will continue to order. I notices the dark spots finally disappearing within a few days after using it. The cost of this product and the effectiveness is priceless when you start seeing the results. I normally don&#x27;t bother to write reviews but after seeing the great positive result am experiencing, I wanted to share it, in case someone is going through the same skin discoloration I was going through. Seeing these dark patches on my upper lip even after waxing, sometime it made it worse! You feel bad about yourself and don&#x27;t even want people to look at you in the face. Try this product, you don&#x27;t lose anything and gain a lot! Best of luck</li>
            <li> I used Porcelana-- a different product-- for the past year and saw a tiny bit of fade but that&#x27;s all. This product is really working well. I don&#x27;t give many reviews for products I buy but it is amazing how well the brown is disappearing and it&#x27;s only been a week or so.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after my doctor prescribed a 4% hydroquinone cream for melasma- which was $100 and not covered by my insurance.  I was worried about taking a risk on this  over the counter product, however, the results were amazing. I noticed a dramatic improvement within the first week of use.  After three weeks of use I am now only using this product a few times a week for maintenance. I am very pleased with the results! I do recommend using a high SPF sunblock while using this product for maximum results.</li>
            <li> I received the product on time&lt;br /&gt;I have notice peeling of the skin after 3 use, this I don&#x27;t mind as the spots are lightening once the skin peels&lt;br /&gt;I have just used for 3 days so far, I will await a month or so before upgrading my ratings&lt;br /&gt;so far it seems to be working great as I have seen lightening of some acne spots , the true test will be the lightening of my melasma spots&lt;br /&gt;note: There is a slight tingling and some peeling but nothing major</li>
            <li> Super-excellent product. It Works great. After many years of the search for the product that works, I found it. Thanks</li>
            <li> Have been using for more than a month a don&#x27;t really see any lightening of my sunspots. My skin does feel smoother and maybe with more time I will see improved results.  Decent product considering the price.</li>
            <li> What can I say but thank to whoever developed this life saving product! You saved my life from shame! Also Thank God for this product. My melasma journey started when I was working night duties as RN, people say it&#x27;s was the result of sleepless nights, but it got worsened as the years progressed. I also went to Africa on mission and spent much time in the sun this made it worst. I started to use hydroquinone to help lighten it but that made it worst it will appear the brand I was purchasing was adulterated one! Then I hit the menopause and the condition got worst, the areas on my face got covered with very dark ugly patches around my cheek and eye area, and made my eye area looked like an owl! I became very depressed and began to look for solution. Over the years, I went from one product to another, I spent so much money consulting with dermatologist, I went to Spas and did so many facials all to no avail! Perhaps the most painful experience was one visit to a dermatologist in Boca Raton, the lady took the photo of my face, told me she would have to an expert dermatologist in New York to have a look, I knew she was upto something because she said she has &amp;#34;never seen anything like this&amp;#34; few weeks later, she calle to say we can&#x27;t help you...I wanted laser treatment but she said it will only make it worst! That was when I discovered Procelain skin whitening serum, within the first week of use I began to peel, the darkened areas around my cheek literally began to peel! Yeeeeeees, I found the product that really works! Within 6 weeks, the black ugly patches had faded by 65% in my own opinion, I was using too much and so the areas got darkened and delayed the brightening due to too much/repeated peeling so I stopped for a while and allowed healing....bingo I&#x27;ve only got 15-20% of the ugly dark pigmentation to go! Thank you so much, and I really thank Jesus Who I prayed to for helping to find this product! I&#x27;m still working on the 20% of discoloration and I know it&#x27;ll happen!&#x27;ll happen!</li>
            <li> Great product! It works great- I&amp;#34;ve been using it every day before going to bed. I am noticing the brown spots getting lighter. It has not irritated or peeled my skin in an extreme manner, it seems to work in a gradual way, leaving the skin  moist without drying it! I &amp;#34;ve been using it on my face, neck, chest and hands, I will continue to use it until i get the desired results! Thank you.</li>
            <li> I tried for number of months but it doesn&#x27;t work. Ingredients in the product sounds great but it doesn&#x27;t work on my skin. I tried to be fair so I gave enough time to evaluate this product but it&#x27;s waste of money.</li>
            <li> Sorry, but it does not work :) hence the low rating. I have used it for a loooong time hoping to see results. Nope, does not work. Alas.</li>
            <li> Product is doing a good job with fading of sun spots on my face. It does have a little sting to it but nothing unbearable. I would recommend this.</li>
            <li> I purchased after customer review and used it.  I waited a week for results and did not peel.  I used the bottle in a month.</li>
            <li> This is am AMAZING product! I have had brown spots on my upper lip, it is VERY noticeable to me! I felt SO embarrassed about this since it started happening &amp; slowly getting worse. I went to the dermatologist &amp; he per scrimped the cream, I used it off &amp; on &amp; just was down right frustrated so I kept it in a drawer, recently I pulled it out &amp; started using it again in the hope of it working &amp; me making an effect to use it daily.&lt;br /&gt;I came upon this product on an Amazon recommendation, so I looked at it the product description, read the reviews, looked at the price &amp; thought, hell I have nothing to lose so I ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;FIRST-Super fast ship! I was waiting on the edge of my seat to receive this &amp; it was delivered in such a FAST time frame that was amazing on its own!&lt;br /&gt;Second- I read all the product information &amp; before going to bed that night I used it, honestly I really had no expectation.&lt;br /&gt;I am now on my FOURTH night of using it &amp; have ALREADY SAW A HUGE DIFFERENCE! SWEAR!!!&lt;br /&gt;I could NOT believe it myself! Today was the first day I put make up on &amp; I did NOT have to &amp;#34;build/paste up&amp;#34; to cover the spot/s! AMAZING!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I am NOWHERE done with the bottle but already ordering another one! I will NEVER EVER look in the mirror &amp; worry about the spot/s again! It has taken care of &amp; continues to take care of the problem/s but it has made me more confident! After years of suffering I HAVE found my answer!!!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for an AWESOME, AMAZING, HELPFUL,WONDERFUL, MIRACLE  PRODUCT!!!</li>
            <li> exelente producto gracias</li>
            <li> The serum made mi dark spots darker and now they look more notecible. So i guess it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> very good peouct for those who wana remove black spotting from face. i used it for upper lips. works greart</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT WORKS. I have had a large developing brown spot on my forehead for the last several years. It was something akin to melasma - I never had it formerly diagnosed. After 8 weeks of use, I can barely see it anymore. I expect that after a few more weeks I will not be able to see it at all. I have been trying to exfoliate once a week so that the product can get deep down, and have religiously been using a face lotion with zinc in it to protect against further sun damage. I went into using this product a skeptic - nothing had worked so far, I I had given other products MONTHS to produce results. I am so, so, so happy with this, and I will buy again when it runs out.</li>
            <li> This product really works as many others have stated. I had post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH) on my upper lip after having impetigo. It takes time, but this product will work for hyperpigmentation. I cannot say whether it works for melasma or not because I do not have that. I have been using this product for about 4 weeks and the red spot on my upper lip has gotten about 50% lighter. Keep in mind when using this product that the affected area may get worse (in my case much worse) before it starts to get better. It takes of the dead skin which can appear to make the area more red, but through continued uses, it will lighten up. I experienced pretty heavy peeling of the area to which I applied the serum, maybe because it&#x27;s on the lip, but that&#x27;s a relatively minor side effect. Also, you must make sure you keep the area moisturized because it will tend to look like snake skin after use if not keep moisturized. I use the serum every other day, and the days I&#x27;m not using it I will use vitamin e oil and petroleum jelly, which seems to work well. I highly recommend this product to anyone suffering from hyperpigmentation. Just keep a long-term mindset when using this product because it will take time to work, but will definitely help the hyperpigmentation.</li>
            <li> I have dark spots above my cheeks, I think it&#x27;s melonin?  I used to get chemical peels every month and after almost a year, it did  get rid of a huge dark spot I had but it came right back.  I used this whitening serum and it lightened up my dark spots.</li>
            <li> I was nervous purchasing this online. I didn&#x27;t find any reviews on this on any websites. I was soooo really desperate that I&#x27;m like I seriously have nothing to lose! I&#x27;ve had embarrassing scars at brown patches for yearssssss! Tried everything in the book! This stuff really works. It took almost two months, and the scars are gone. Like they were never there!!!!!!! Its two ounces but its enough! It works! Apply a layer after you shower and let it dry. Do it before bedtime. Do it everyday and you&#x27;ll see results!    PRICE SUCKS! But its worth it. :)</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!! I got results in two days, my skin just keeps getting better and better!</li>
            <li> This product WORKS!!  Yes, my skin is a little leather-y and red but, there are only very faint brown spots!  Wish I would have tried this years ago.  And stayed out of the sun.</li>
            <li> Amazing magic serum works so well it&#x27;s scary</li>
            <li> The product label looked a bit funny. The list of ingredients does not provide the percentages of the active ingredients. I was too scared to put in on my face.</li>
            <li> This is did not do anything for my skin. I have dark spots from pregnancy and acne as well. This is did not help at all.</li>
            <li> Great ptoduct. To see results you have to use it everyday. I did not use it every day at the beginning so I thought it was not working. When I came back for my vacation my melasma got so bad even tho use SPF 50 on my face that I had no choice but try it again. Within 2 Weekes later it&#x27;s almost all gone. Great product just use it every day to see faster results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m consistently amazed at people who expect a product to work like magic. These are the people who need pills not foods to heal them. Amino acids, herbs and supplements take at least 3 months to saturate the system to work, and so do at lot of these face products. Vitamin A, Collagen, hyaluronic acid etc.&lt;br /&gt;  Look at the reviews. Look at does it smell funky, that&#x27;s a deal breaker. , Is it bad packaging and leeky?  Does it have FRAGRANCE in it? BAD. Look up the strange chemical names,, if there are too many, forget it. Get an app for your phone for cosmetic ingredients, very useful.&lt;br /&gt;  Look up a line called Epicuren, Their sunscreen is the best in the world! Micronized zinc oxide.. the only natural sunscreen, all the others are chemicals... do you want heat sun and chemicals on your face??? I think not.. plus it&#x27;s a day time moisturizer with beautiful ingredients that you can pronounce and eat many of them, big plus you can put it around the eyes.. no stinging... kids love this. This product is a  great price, with good adjunct ingredient, look them up., I just came from my doctor for a little botox and his Hydro-product was $53 for 2% ,  $110 for 4%  !!!!&lt;br /&gt;Let you body +time+products + health...</li>
            <li> Works well on brown spots and exfoliting.</li>
            <li> But quickly plateaus. Within 10 days, lightened my pigmentation by 50%, but no improvement beyond that. Like dermatologists say, there is no cure for it, only improvement. Overall happy. Recommended.</li>
            <li> I thought this cream was going to work well for me, especially at the price it was at. But after using it for quite a while, there was no difference to my dark scars. I&#x27;m sure it is working for a lot other people, but I&#x27;m afraid not for me!</li>
            <li> this is amazing and i am not sure if this serum should get all the credit or not. before i used this serum i had severe acne- all day every single day! since i have used this i have not had one single pimple!!! i can&#x27;t hardly believe it myself. Other factors that may have helped my acne issues. I gave birth to a baby, I breastfeed, no longer work (therefore have No stress, I am on a regular home made food diet) I mostly cook vegan dishes now and try to stay away from all dairy and meat. But I think the serum has helped a lot! i don&#x27;t use any face creams or washes ( just hot water and cetephil once a day) and started using M.A.C. makeup- the powder as concealer. Maybe my skin is compatible with this makeup- ALL others made me break out.</li>
            <li> I thought this product is good to keep around. My skin defiantly changed for the better after two uses. Then I tried it more offten that your suppose to and it burned my skin. I put some a,c,e supplement on it and it healed over night! So I knew you can&#x27;t use it days in a row. However, it&#x27;s not the discoloration that went away but the breakouts are gone and my skin is smoother! So now I&#x27;m working on getting the spots/discoloration gone! I would buy it again because it clearly helped me feel and look better!</li>
            <li> I have been using the product for about 3 weeks and I have seen no change what so ever. Not Happy</li>
            <li> I had hopes for this product. I figured that since it included some natural ingredients, it would be a gentler/safer option compared to other lightening products on Amazon. Similarly, I reasoned that If it doesn&#x27;t work, I could count my losses and move on. However, just because it has natural ingredients does not make it gentle, the hydroquinone outweighs any of the perceived safer ingredients. This product burned my skin and actually made it DARKER. I&#x27;m mixed and my color is similar to Naya Rivera, perhaps this product works on people with lighter or darker skin. Sadly, this product did not lighten my skin, in fact it darkened all the areas that it touched. This may be a special case, but if I were you and I had similar skin color I would not risk it. I used this product to lighten my underarms and neck. My neck will now need serious repair, my underarms are darker as well but not as dark as how my neck has become. This outcome has left me feeling so defeated, I regret this purchase please avoid this product.</li>
            <li> The serum is Ok, not great but it helped mildly.  It reduces the immediate skin dark spots but they are still noticeable from 5+ feet away.  When you get within that range they are still very apparent.  Dan</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product to treat hyperpigmentation on my upper lip for about 4 days now. I haven&#x27;t seen any lightening but my skin is a little red and peeling. I&#x27;m going to keep using it for a while longer and see if the side effects stop</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product! I&#x27;ve been using it every other night for about 6 weeks and have seen an incredible improvement in my complexion. I have an olive skin tone which scars very easily. I&#x27;ve also suffered chronically from adult hormonal acne for about 5 years, which has left me in a constant battle against deep, painful cystic breakouts and the ugly scars they leave behind. I&#x27;ve tried Proactiv, OTC products with benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, AHA, glycolic acid, oral contraceptives, and Retin-A. I&#x27;m actually still on Retin-A and the oral contraceptives, which have helped a bit, but adding this serum into my skin care regimen has made all the difference in the world. Allow me to explain...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was kind of skeptical about purchasing the product to begin with since I had never heard of the brand. But after reading all the rave reviews, I decided to give it a try. I figured if I didn&#x27;t like it, I would just return it. Seriously, one of the BEST decisions I&#x27;ve ever made! Honestly, I was sold after the first use. I put it on that first night, and when I woke up the next morning, my face was peeling like a snake. I know that sounds gross but, I&#x27;ve paid hundreds of dollars for spa facials and fancy chemical peels with estheticians, and some of them haven&#x27;t come close to the peel that I got [and continue to get] from this serum! I have seen a dramatic decrease in my old acne scars AND in the amount of cystic breakouts I get. My skin is still nowhere near perfect, but I certainly see a little more improvement after each use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as application itself - it definitely stings quite a bit when you first put it on, but that stinging goes away after about 10 minutes. Like I mentioned earlier, the product is quite potent and makes your skin peel, therefore I&#x27;ve only been using it every other night (sometimes every two nights) to give my skin a bit of a break from the irritation. Also, I always, always, always use a facial sunscreen before stepping out of my house in the morning. It doesn&#x27;t matter if it&#x27;s 90 degrees or pouring rain out - I never skip out on the sunscreen. I know you&#x27;ve probably heard it a million times, but sunscreen is crucial to skin health, ESPECIALLY if you&#x27;re using a product as strong as this one!een before stepping out of my house in the morning.

            <li> It made my skin terrible. The chemical is so strong ! i put a small amount above my lips (right under my nose is where my melasma i  ) and the next day it went from dark looking to red , i mortised my skin putting sunscreen but it didn&#x27;t do nothing but made me itch and have a burning feeling. The only reason why I give it 3 stars is because im currently using it in a 1st degree burn i have in my arm and its actually lightening.</li>
            <li> I have had melasma on my forehead for a few years.  I started using this a month ago and my melasma looks so much better.  It is hardly even visible anymore!  I did have a moderate amount of peeling and redness, but completely worth it.  I have tried numerous products that haven&#x27;t made any noticeable difference.  I am so thrilled I bought this!</li>
            <li> I have melasma marks on my face from having mask of pregnancy over 6 years ago.  They cover my forehead and ring my eyes, especially after I&#x27;ve been in the sun. I&#x27;ve tried expensive products and even having them lasered off, with little to no results. But this product lightens them up within a few days.  After using it for a few weeks, the spots were virtually gone. I def. recommend it!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if this would work or not but I gave it a shot. Took about a week before I saw results but my freckles are DEFINITELY lighter! I will keep using it until they are completely gone. Very exciting! It&#x27;s not a fast process but it WORKS so that&#x27;s what matters! Don&#x27;t forget to use a strong broad-spectrum sunscreen when you go outside (even just for a short while) because otherwise your freckles or sunspots will return and be even darker!</li>
            <li> This product is worth the buck. Guys/Girls it really works and is not irritating. Noticeable softness in complexion is achieved in just two days with dark marks fading and the overall complexion blending into a smooth hue. All it takes is just 2 to 3 pumps and it spreads evenly on skin. You&#x27;d love results in the morning. I&#x27;ve used this for about two weeks now and I have no regrets.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t expect much from a non-prescription product, but this stuff really works. Faded sun spots, even some of the hyper-pigmentation above my lip (which has been a big trouble spot for me.) I&#x27;ve seen dermatologists and had prescription products that did not work as well as this does. HIGHLY recommend.</li>
            <li> Just burned a lot more then anything.</li>
            <li> I have Melasma!! I have been using this product for three weeks now.  Within the first wk I started seeing some slight peeling.  I couldn&#x27;t believe. Now my Melasma are almost gone.  After spending so much money on dermatologist for 1 1/2 years.  Wish I had found this before.  Very happy and I put on my sunblock everyday.  I Also  recommend it to some of my friends. Good product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 8 days and I already see a huge improvement in my melasma and sun spots. Not only are the dark spots significantly lighter, but my skin also looks brighter, tighter and healthier. I have had melasma on and off since having my son. For me it was brought on by pregnancy but returns from the combination of birth control and sun. My winter trips to Hawaii always bring it back with a vengeance. I work in the spa industry so I am aware of the ingredients and how they affect the skin. To be honest, I wasn&#x27;t expecting much because of the price--In the spa, products of this nature often cost over $100.00. So needless to say, I&#x27;m thrilled!  It&#x27;s important to note to consumers who may not be aware of how hyperpigmentation works, you must must must wear sunscreen every day during and after the fading process. If you don&#x27;t the spots will return and sometimes darker. When lightening the skin you are not reversing the damage done. That is all at a deeper level in the skin and can never be undone. But with proper sunscreen and sun hats it can be unnoticeable.  With that said, melasma is often hormonal and will go away with time after pregnancy or when you stop taking birth control. I will update in a few months on the progress!</li>
            <li> I already have dry skin and using it made my skin worse. Otherwise, its a okay product. But I would re think of ordering it again if and only if I have a product that could take care of the dryness of my skin</li>
            <li> I love it. it has been helping with the dark spots on my face.  They keep coming back but that is my issue because I am out in the sun all the time.  It would be terribly worse if I did not use it daily.  A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I used this product on a particularly stubborn sun spot that I&#x27;ve had on my cheek for years.  After about 6 or 7 uses, there was a noticeable difference.  After 10 or so, the spot had faded to almost nothing!  This product is fantastic as well as reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Works great. Noticed fading within a few days. Willl continue to use</li>
            <li> I have been using the product for about 3 weeks and my skin has fewer visible brown spots/blotchiness and overall looks less sun damaged. I had some really dark spots and they look lighter but not entirely gone.  I am using less concealer each day and am happy with the results.</li>
            <li> After one month&#x27;s use, I see no difference in the sun damage spots on my hands. I would not buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I have used this about 4 times and definitely noticed my spot lightened a lot</li>
            <li> nice brightening serum. Not sure if it&#x27;s helpful for melasma.</li>
            <li> I have suffered from acne for years, which have turned into hyperpigmentation. I have been using this product for about a month now and I can tell it is working. My skin tone seems more even and I now use 1/3 the amount of makeup I had to use prior. It has not gotten rid of all of it completely, but it has made a significant difference.</li>
            <li> Im an African American female that wanted to correct some uneven tones in face.  After a week of using I can tell theres change. I was expecting change to come a little faster but I guess be patient.  I will try a second bottle and see what happens</li>
            <li> I bought this because of the rave that it would help with my hyper pigmentation and dark spots/circles. The first night I applied it as directions told me, and not much happened..nothing at all, no peeling. The second night I decided to use a little more this time because maybe i&#x27;d used too little. My face (above my lip specifically) was beet red (and I&#x27;m an African American woman). It was peeling the entire day and I was in so much pain. I thought OK, at least it&#x27;s working. I applied neosporin during the healing process. I had read reviews about this product making conditions worse, but I decided to go with the positive reviews as I was desperate. WOW. My troubled areas are darker than ever. I am so sad. I guess I will stick to traditional and organic lightening processes. Terrible stuff, don&#x27;t waste your money! Please.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on the good review. I have many dark spots on my upper cheeks after I had my second child. I never used facial scrub to exfoliate my skin and used facial soap sparingly. I wash my face with lukewarm water using a baby wash cloth. I use many high end skin moisturizers and anti-aging stuff. I did not see any results and my face got duller and darker. I couldn&#x27;t get my face back to rosy and soft before I had my second child. Moisturizer would just sit on my face and become sticky and greasy.&lt;br /&gt;After 12 days of using this product on my cheeks and upper cheeks, I saw some minor peeling. I was surprised at how many dead skin cells that had cumulated on my face all these year. After another 5 days of using the product, most dark spots started to fade. Pores are smaller, skin is soft to touch and my face no longer looks dull and lifeless. I use olay&#x27;s regenerated cream and 7-in-1 and plenty of neutrogena SPF to protect my face in the morning. The drug store products now get absorbed into my skin since they are no longer blocked by the dead skin cells.&lt;br /&gt;One thing I want to point out is, apply thin layer on problematic area as instructed. If you don&#x27;t feel tingling, check to see if the layer you applied is too thin. Don&#x27;t apply a glob, you&#x27;ll burn your face. Don&#x27;t rob moisturizer into your face. Gently pat it into your face until absorbed. Use of this product makes your skin tender.&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with this product. I already recommended my sisters to use it. They both noticed that my face is smoother and clearer. Note to people, it does not whiten your face. It&#x27;s not a bleach. It does peel off dead skin cells to reveal healthy skin cells and that&#x27;s the color you should expect to see.&lt;br /&gt;For people with acne or problematic and sensitive skin, this product may be harsh.</li>
            <li> I have never written a review on anything but I couldn&#x27;t not write a review on this miracle serum!!! I have had stubborn melasma for about 2 years on my upper lip and cheeks-- i have tried everything from 4% hydroquinone cream to glycolic acid cream to getting off birth control...nothing seemed to work until this!!! I used to put full coverage makeup on (dermablend) on and would still be able to see a grey mustache and cheeks...now, though, I can&#x27;t see the patches anymore when I have my makeup on! My skin peeled off and revealed new pink skin with no grey!!! I&#x27;ve also been taking MSM Supplements as well as a multivitamin, magnesium and zinc oxide but I feel like this porcelain skin serum had the most to do with it..&lt;br /&gt;I found this just by googling mulberry supplements and decided to take a chance on this stuff since it&#x27;s only 30 bucks..and I will definitely be buying this again!!!! Thank you for creating this amazing stuff it saved me :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a month now and i have not seen any change in my skin. I bought based on reviews but feel they may have been a hoax. I would love to return this product if I could.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT!!!  100% RECOMMEND IT....</li>
            <li> It really works and it&#x27;s not as expensive as I used to pay for many other similar products that I purchased before.</li>
            <li> This product burned my skin upon applying it. It did cause my skin to peel in the areas I applied it to but haven&#x27;t noticed the area lightening much.</li>
            <li> First off let me tell you what nationalities I am and what color and type of skin I have, because that does make a difference when looking for certain skin care products. What works on dark or dry skin might not work so well on light or oily skin... I am Arawak (indigenous people of Aruba, think Native American) Italian, French, Dutch, and German. My skin is combination/oily, and the color is medium-tan. This is the first and only product I have found that really lightened my skin. I was amazed at how well and fast it worked, I noticed a difference in just a few weeks! It did not cause any pealing for me, it did make my skin a little dry at times but a moisturizer helped with that. Also it does not hurt to take a day or two off from application if you notice some irritation.</li>
            <li> It seems to work. It will make  your face red in areas with no discoloration, so it is strong, but it seems to work.</li>
            <li> This is not a good product if you have sensitive skin.  Check with a dermatologist before purchasing.  The product actually burnt me; however, I received a refund. :)</li>
            <li> I love, love this product and the price. I am a dark skin african American woman and I have spent so much on other products for hyperpigmentation around my neck, this started to work and I saw results in a little over a week with daily use.  There was a little peeling and also minor tingling when applied, but, finally what a miracle. Im stocking up.</li>
            <li> So.. I have struggled with melasma ever since I started birth control and during/ after my pregnancy. It&#x27;s pesky and annoying and just won&#x27;t go away after everything I&#x27;ve tried, as well as prescriptions. The only reason I purchased this product was because of the reviews here on Amazon. Not even kidding after 3 days it&#x27;s almost unnoticeable. This is incredible!!! So far I haven&#x27;t had any peeling or redness. It&#x27;s literally just disappearing in front of my eyes. I almost want to cry tears of joy because I have waited years to feel &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; again. For anyone who has hyper pigmentation due to the same cause-- look no further you have found your pot of gold!</li>
            <li> Four years ago I went on a trip to St Lucia and came back with two dark spots above my lip. I was very self conscious about it, and tried a few creams, but it seemed it was here to stay. During and immediately following my pregnancy they became very distinct. I was looking into laser treatments when I decided to give this a shot. I have had it 9 days, and I missed a couple nights because I was out of town. The difference is remarkable. I posted before and after pics, the before was from January (I didn&#x27;t have a more recent clear pic, mostly because I&#x27;ve been hiding from the camera the past four years). The after is after 7 days of use. I had some slight discomfort this morning (I apply right before bed), but it wasn&#x27;t bad and resolved quickly. Certainly worth the results in my mind!!!</li>
            <li> Used as directed but no noticeable results after 3 months.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice much difference with regards to lightening of dark marks on my face still halfway on my first bottle so I guess its too soon to see the result? We&#x27;ll see!</li>
            <li> This is the best product ever for Melanesia.  Works slowly but it works.</li>
            <li> I jus love this product..I had freckles around my nose area since I am using dis they fade away..I am seeing the result right now..i use dis twice a day in morning nd bed time my left side freckles r totaly gone and righr side fades away..I love this if anyone has freckles and brown spots its perfect for them</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum every night on my hands, arms and legs for about a month now.  There has been a gradual lightening of skin spots and absolutely NO irritation.  This is remarkable for me as I tend to react to everything but the most hypo-allergenic products.  I HIGHLY recommend this product!</li>
            <li> i dont like this product my melasma is more worst than before i hate this product my skin is really dark i spent a lot of my for my dermatologist</li>
            <li> I have had severe melasma for a few years. I have been using this for three weeks and it has reduced it by about 75per cent. My skin looks amazing. It hasn&#x27;t burned my skin. I am so impressed.</li>
            <li> i just finished a bottle of this product and i can barely see difference.... it didnt work... im def dissapointed, NOT RECOMEND IT!</li>
            <li> Smooth deal. Nice product! Love it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a month and I have to say it does work! However it is not as strong as a peel or a spa treatment but for those of us on a budget it works. I have noticed lightening of hyper pigmentation marks. Prior to this, I was very self conscious about my skin because my hyper pigmentation was very dark and purple. Although my skin is not completely flawless this product has lightened the scars enough so I do not feel self conscious about myself. Your skin will peel in certain areas but I just exfoliated my face to get rid of that. You have to be patient to see results and with continuous use you will be just as satisfied as I am! I will repurchase when my bottle is out.</li>
            <li> GOT IT FOR A FRIEND DON&#x27;T KNOW IF IT IS HELPING</li>
            <li> I had a reaction from my birth control that gave me melasma right before my wedding. It looked like I had a mustache. This stuff did the trick in the matter of maybe 2 weeks tops. I will say that overuse will cause your skin to peel so just don&#x27;t layer it on multiple times a day. I simply put a thin layer on at night and it really did the job. I was so pleased with this product!</li>
            <li> Although I know that some of the ingredients, are dangerous, I also know that I have spent so much money on other products, which just did not work, that I was willing to give this a try.&lt;br /&gt;I started seeing a little improvement within the first week. As I continue to use it twice daily, others in my family have noticed too. There are still a few areas which were pretty dark, and are being stubborn, but I am hoping they too will lighten in time.&lt;br /&gt;The first week there was a bit of stinging, and redness, but never any peeling. I am happy with this product, and hope they keep it in stock. I also use this on my chest, where I have a lot of damage from my sun worsipping years. It is really working quickly on this area. I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> This is my first Amazon review, and the only reason I&#x27;m doing it is because I HAVE to give this product its Kudos.  First of all, when I ordered it, it said it would take a week for delivery.  I got it in a couple days!  It arrived on a Friday, which made me thrilled!  I could use it over the weekend to see if a) it worked, and b) did I get a reaction from it?  I figured I&#x27;d have the weekend to find out!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, it WORKS!!!!!!!  My first night using it (Fri nite), I felt it stinging, but  I just tapped lightly on the spots I put it on, and the mild pain subsided.  THen I have continued using it, and wow.  I can see a difference!  My problem spots are my cheeks (an inch area under where my sunglasses sat) and my nose.  Seriously, my nose looks like someone painted on a brown spotted cow.  My nose area is the worst, and being honest, the darker spots there are not as improved as my cheek area, but I&#x27;m hoping that over time it will help to really reduce the spots.  I can see a huge difference in my cheek area and the initial peeling I had in the first 5 to 7 days is pretty much gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am really happy with this product, but hope when I have to order my next bottle the pump will work better. (My bottle I got, the pump doesn&#x27;t work very well, and I seem to waste a lot of it as it goes flying off in all directions so I waste a lot of it.  :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me tell you, I wouldn&#x27;t take the time to sit here and write a review about something that hasn&#x27;t made me very happy unless I really felt that the product is worth it.  Bad pump or not....  this product has given me confidence in my face again!  :)</li>
            <li> I have had melasma on my upper lip since the birth of my son, and have tried everything to make it go away. It&#x27;s been a little over a week and I think (??) this might be working.  The only thing I am noticing is that I am experiencing some dryness, redness and peeling while using the product, so I am giving my skin a few days break and using a good moisturizer to let it heal then I will start using it again.  I am being very careful to use a good SPF whenever I&#x27;m in the sun too because I know that will make it worse.  I really hope it&#x27;s working!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really happy with this product. I never had sunspots / melasma before I turned 40. I play golf in the summer and am in the sun. Even with an spf on my face I will STILL get melasma and I realize that. The sun is just going to make it a bit of a never ending battle. However, this product is really helping diminish the spots I have and is keeping them from getting worse. Once summer is over, I am confident that I will have even more resolution.&lt;br /&gt;I have had minimal dryness so far. I do my normal evening routing and use the product over my moisturizer, etc. When I have had dryness or peeling, I make sure to exfoliate.&lt;br /&gt;Really really pleased! I also was very impressed with the information that is sent along with the product. I will continue to use this.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery, I&#x27;m using the produce at night, have seem some results &amp; I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll see more in time.  May need to order more see what happens, so would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know what to expect but was hoping for the best. I&#x27;ve noticed results in about 6 days. Mild peeling, not much redness or irritation but all of that is better than the brown spots. Inexpensive especially compared to the $2500 laser treatment the dermatologist suggested.</li>
            <li> I have melanoma on my skin here and there. I have been using the product for about a month and see some difference, however it is only slight. I have faith in this product and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this.  Perhaps the spots I have are different than what this treats, but I saw no improvement in my spots on my cheeks after using daily for 3 weeks.  Also, I used it in an area that I had a blemish in hopes that it would heal the mark faster, and it ended up burning my face.  I would have taken the red spot over a burn mark any day (it healed though!).  Personally wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> I bought the serum and used it every night for about 1 1/2 weeks. At that time, I developed some of the dry flaking as indicated may occur in the instructions. So I dropped back to using it 2-3 times per week. I have had the product for almost a month. The browning above my lips has faded but is still noticeable to me. My husband says the lip browning is much better, I no longer look like I need to shave. The brown spots on my cheek have faded to lesser of an extent but I have only used it on my cheek for about 2 weeks. I am near 40 with fair skin, and I am blonde, with blonde eyebrows. Is it worth it?  Well yes. It is just as expensive as other products I have tried but far more effective.</li>
            <li> It did not work at all, just burned a lot.</li>
            <li> I had bad melasma on my forehead but didnt really mind. When it showed up over my lip though, decided to do some experimentation. Im not really in love with the idea of blasting my face (and brain) with lasers, so I figured rubbing on some (possibly) toxic chemicals was the lesser evil. I use this every morning and night, and it was very stingy at first, so I combined it with a whitening lotion (the one that has both day and night formulas) and im definitely seeing improvements. If I happen to get caught outside on a particularly sunny day, I know Im going to see the brown marks the next day, but they seem to fade over the next day or two if I use this consistently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I finished the first bottle, but after a lapse in use my melasma came back again,  I purchased a second bottle but unfortunately did not see nearly the same results. Im not sure if I got a bad batch or something but Im hesitant to spend any more on the same product with inconsistent results. This time around I am going to try something else.</li>
            <li> I used it nightly and there was no noticeable change in the appearance of my skin. I finished it about a month ago and won&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for two weeks and the brown spots on my upper lip have pretty much disappeared, no joke. I&#x27;m 35 and was devastated when the spots appeared. I initially went to a dermatologist a year ago for help but the $100 cream they gave me only gave me a rash.  When the spots started getting darker even with sunscreen I started researching around and found the reviews for this product very helpful.  I am so grateful this product exists, it really does work, the brown spots are very faint now, in another two weeks they&#x27;ll be completely gone. Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> Used for 3 weeks and. ..nada. Used the ingredients in other products so I know the effects I should get</li>
            <li> I tried the whole bottle, produced irritation, itching and darkened my skin. My face spots did not fade, only made it worse!&lt;br /&gt;A waste of time and money! And pain on top of it! *^%#T%&amp;@</li>
            <li> LOVE this product, it worked wonders on my skin.</li>
            <li> This a very good product . I like it .It Itakes time to work on dark spots but it is working . I have used it for six weeks and can see great results . My face still has a long way to go so I will keep using it .</li>
            <li> My 34 year old daughter and I (age 60) used this product for two weeks and did feel a tingling sensation while applying it.  But then I had a dermatology appt. and took the bottle with me to show the ladies that worked in the skin care section of the office. They had heard of Porcelain skin Whitening but told me some things I thought the readers should know.  Hyperpigmentation goes way down into the skin almost like a scar and takes weeks to get rid of.  A product that one buys from Amazon or a dept store doesn&#x27;t have enough hydroquinone or glycolic acid in it to remove this.  It may fade a little but it doesn&#x27;t go away.  I don&#x27;t feel the dermatology workers were trying to sell. me one of their products because they spent so much time explaining the skin and how it gets harmed from the sun and what to do about it.  My daughter and I want products that work within a small amount of time and do a good job.  You need the help and information a dermatologist can give you to get those results.  This office had about six different product lines on the shelf and the esthetican went right to Glytone Step Up # 2 the first ingredient is water the second is glycolic acid.  She said to use it once a day because it&#x27;s so strong and after three weeks use it twice a day. It will peel off the skin that is suffering from hyperpigmentation.  The most important thing to remember is when you are using a skin fading product use sun screen protector of at least 35 and apply 2 to 3 times a day if you are outside.</li>
            <li> I bought this product 2 weeks ago and have been meaning to write a review of my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Firstly, let me give a little insight to my skin type.&lt;br /&gt;I am bi-racial, I have lots of freckles, my skin is &#x27;beige&#x27;, I am not prone to acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My experience:&lt;br /&gt;This item has defiantly worked for me. I did peel initially, but it was great because firstly, my whole face did not peel at once. I would put it on a night and in the morning I would see a small portion of my skin peeling, but enough to just gently scrub of with my usual morning facial scrub and i&#x27;m ready for work looking absolutly fine. This has been happening over a two week period and I have now stopped peeling and my skin is very visibly brighter, whiter and my freckles are much less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, I must say, my face feels much lighter and smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not break out. I do highly recommend that you do not expose yourself to sunlight during the course of using the product as I did notice that this causes dis-coloration. You are absolutely fine exposing yourself to sunlight after the product and this does not affect you. I can assure you of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very happy with this product and will be purchasing again shortly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> Great stuff .. It stings a little at first but the affects on the skin were evident.. It&#x27;s even more noticeable to others than  a mirror state for yourself.. The process takes time but you will definitely notice a cleaner more high lighted skin tone</li>
            <li> This worked great in just under 1 week for my melasma!</li>
            <li> I have one small brown spot and have used this product for nearly 2 months but have not seen results yet.</li>
            <li> Its alright, but I liked this stuff I got a few months ago. Love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
            <li> so this has all the ingredients i researched online that would help lighten dark spots but I have not seen any change after a month of use. kinda dissapointed as anyone would be after buying something they thought would work and it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I purchased and used this product on my brown skin and it wouldn&#x27;t allow the darkening of spots, it pilled and turned red, but didn&#x27;t darken.  Over time the treated area smoothed out and lightened.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to make this a 5 star and a month ago I would have. It worked great for the Melasma I had/have but only temporarily. I have sensitive skin so when I first used this it did burn/peel parts of my face. IT IS LIKE A CHEMICAL PEEL so you have to be careful with how much you use and where. I took care of the burnt spots with Neosporin‎ and it healed/peeled nicely. Also, it made me brake out on the parts of the face where I was using it. I was EXTREMELY happy with the results!! I didn&#x27;t have to use foundation on the spots anymore....YEAY!! I stopped using it because I don&#x27;t get the point in peeling your face/new skin constantly. If I had the results I was going for why keep peeling my skin, maybe I&#x27;m wrong.  I did use it for about a month straight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now with all that said....Summer is here and even though I use Broad Spectrum SPF 110 Sunscreen Lotion the Melasma spots are BACK!!!  I am so disappointed!! I do have to say my face is not as bad as before and before it was really not bad, it was more of a mild to moderate case of Melasma BUT it is back! Specially on my cheeks....boo-hoo!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though I am a bit dreadful and not looking foward to the treatment I am planning on using this again but I will have to wait until summer is over and I am not out with the kids at the beach or vacationing where I have a lot of sun exposure. Even with the SPF 110 Sunscreen Lotion this really peels your face so you have the sun hitting your raw face.  Maybe after the second peel it comes back lighter and maybe, I am hoping after a few treatments it really disappears and I a happy like I was after the first treatment. However if after 3 or 4 treatments it keeps coming back then there is not point in using this....you are just peeling your face over and over again which I cannot imagine it is healthy for your skin. I will try to post again after a few months.</li>
            <li> I have melasma on on my face that looks like slightly red speckles or light smudges of dirt. I&#x27;ve been using this product for only 10 days now, and already I am seeing definite lightening and clearing of these patches. I&#x27;ve had no irritation or stinging of my skin. I just wash my face at night and rub a tiny bit in.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product. I have had brown patches on my pale skin since I started having children 25 years ago. I am 50 now. I have tried esoterica but I really dislike the old lady smell and greasy feel and would not use it religiously enough for long-term results. I had a laser treatment done once and after a week-long healing process, my results were gone after the first summer day of not applying enough sunscreen...a lot of money wasted!  This stuff feels great on my skin, has no odor, and gives quick results!  I went home to see my family last week and my brother said that I looked like I was in my thirties! I am 2/3 through my first bottle that I bought 2 months ago and I am back to buy more. I would buy a case of this product if I ever heard this company was going out of business.</li>
            <li> I have NOT noticed any change in my brown spots on my face - using good old cheap lemon juice did more good than this - sorry!!!</li>
            <li> This product did nothing for me. Absolutely nothing! I would not recommend if you are searching for a help to lighten discoloration!</li>
            <li> I have some dark dark spots on my face. Some of them are good size and very visible and I have had them for twenty years or so because I was not using sun screen so much when I was younger. As I age, they seemed to have become darker and it is getting hard to hide them with concealer under my makeup. I have tried different whitening serums and creams but with not much success. This whitening serum seemed a little over-priced but I took a chance and purchased it thinking it would be worth it if it worked. So far, it was worth the money. It showed visible results in a couple of days and gave me a motivation to continue to try using it. A couple of the darkest spots sort of lost the contours and started to lose the circle shape. It lightened the center areas of the spots as well. Overall, they don&#x27;t standout on my face as much as before. I noticed it made white patches on my face, but not so visible, that&#x27;s probably where I applied it too much, so I need to be careful. I will continue with this and see what happens!</li>
            <li> Saw no change even though I applied it daily! Would not recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work on my skin. Seems like it made my face darker. Depends on user I guess.</li>
            <li> After reading all the positive reviews, I thought I should give it a try. I&#x27;ve been using the serum for two weeks now, and nothing is happening. It didn&#x27;t burn, didn&#x27;t peel, didn&#x27;t turn pink or red. I feel nothing. My dark spots didn&#x27;t turn lighter and it actually got slightly darker in one spot. I&#x27;ll continue to use it for another two weeks just so I can say that I did use it long enough for seeing results. I need to find another product.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see much result</li>
            <li> Hydraquonone never worked on my skin...this is truly remarkable...!</li>
            <li> Pretty good for melasma it helps it a lot it won&#x27;t make a miracle but it works</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for two months daily and maybe the brown spot on my face is lighter, but I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s just my imagination. The results have not been magical or miraculous. I use it every day and have never broken out. I am half Caucasian, half Asian, and 41, if that&#x27;s a helpful barometer.</li>
            <li> I was diagnosed with melasma which is like a dark mask on the face. I researched to discover what ingredients would lighten the skin. Mulberry, kojic acid, licorice extract along with the 2% hydroquinone is very effective in lightening the skin so I searched for a skin product with these ingredients. After trying so many different products I found Porcelain Skin Whitening Serum to work not only effectively but also fast. Within the first week I saw a difference. I have been using this product for two weeks.The darkness is beginning to lighten up. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have melasma above my upper lip and before it wasn&#x27;t that bad, I would put some make-up over it and go on with my day. But then I started looking up products that could help to wipe this dark, mustache looking thing away since I&#x27;ve had for five years. I don&#x27;t know how I feel about this product. It peels off some of my &amp;#34;dead skin&amp;#34; I guess, but I advise customers to do this over vacation or when you have time to camp out at home for a week because this stuff makes your skin peel like crazy, so crazy that even make-up may not be able to cover it. Secondly, it burns soooo bad. When the skin peels off, it leaves a laceration (at least for me), then your skin to red and hurts pretty bad. I literally had to camp in my house for almost a week because it can make your skin wrinkly in the process and looks weird when I tried to cover it up with make-up. I didn&#x27;t even put that much on.&lt;br /&gt;At the moment, my face looks horrible. It looks like someone has beat me up... My skin above my lip looks worse than before. I can&#x27;t even stand to look at myself without putting foundation on. Every morning when I wake up, I set my alarm an hour before my boyfriend&#x27;s so I can rush to cover my dark spots and burned skin up because I just can&#x27;t let him see me this way. Luckily, it will heel over time and possibly fade away to my natural skin tone, but until then I just have to wait and wait and wait...&lt;br /&gt;If you want instant, safe, and professional results go to the doctor.</li>
            <li> I love this. I have been using it for 10 days on my melasma spots and they are only about half as dark as before. I have spots on my upper lip, similar to another reviewer, and they made me very self conscious. Now they are barely visible at all.&lt;br /&gt;This does cause redness and peeling, but I started using moisturizer with vitamin C on top of this Porcelain Skin Whitening Serum and it has helped.&lt;br /&gt;It is very important to use sunscreen all the time when you are out in the sun, or the spots will come right back.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely keep using this.</li>
            <li> This product turned my skin slightly red within the first couple days of use. It says it will do this on the label. I stopped using it for about a week and then continued applying it morning and night. It has lighted my hyper pigmentation  somewhat but not all the way. I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> It did not work on age spots on my hands. I followed the instructions carefully and it did not work for me.</li>
            <li> Simple did not work,  honestly I think I not from a knock off company.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it a week so far, but I&#x27;ll try to update after it&#x27;s been a while. (Ingredients listed below.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most important reason I&#x27;m giving it 5 stars at this point is because the product does not break out my skin at all (which I&#x27;ve had a problem with in all the other skin lightening formulations I&#x27;ve tried) nor does it dry my skin out or cause irritation. I&#x27;ve been able to abandon my normal regimen of tea tree oil + acne control moisturizer (Yonka 15 Creme) and simply use this at night. My skin after a week looks smooth, more even, and prettier than before I began using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m almost 40 years old with fair skin prone to freckling, melanoma, and an irritating tendency to break out with acne if I don&#x27;t keep it carefully under control. Even if this does not end up lightening my melanoma/freckles, I&#x27;ll likely keep using it as my single nightly topical treatment since it acts quite well as a moisturizer. But here&#x27;s hoping it will also end up lightening things as well :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are the ingredients from the bottle&#x27;s label, and I&#x27;ve researched a bit to see what each ingredient is purported to do:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Water: (I don&#x27;t think this needs further explanation)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Propylene Glycol: acts as humectant, preservative, &amp; stabilizer; can enhance penetration of other ingredients&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glycolic Acid: alpha hydroxy acid; removes outer layer of dead skin cells on surface of skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hydroquinone (2%): skin lightener; reduces production of melanin; turns toxic when exposed to sunlight (so only use at night)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hydroxyethylcellulose: gelling &amp; thickening agent&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kojic Acid: skin lightener &amp; antioxidant; reduces production of melanin; deteriorates in air &amp; light&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glycyrrhiza Glabra (Licorice) Root Extract: skin lightener, anti-inflammatory, &amp; antioxidant; reduces production of melanin; helps control oil production in skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mulberry Extract: skin lightener, anti-inflammatory, &amp; antioxidant; reduces production of melanin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Triethanolamine: surfactant &amp; pH adjusting chemical; allows water-soluble &amp; oil-soluble ingredients to be blended together&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tetrahexyldecyl Ascorbate: vitamin C that&#x27;s been modified to be more lipid soluble to allow it to better penetrate skin</li>
            <li> Too soon to tell.  Was told to allow 6 weeks before noticing any difference in pigmentation  Not sure I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I have malasma and have tried using almost about everything to lighten it and about 2 yrs ago, I tried n paid for a full IPL photo lazer n it left me with dark burn marks on about 80% of my face. No make-up will cover it, except for tattoo make-up n I woukd have to use abt 2-3 layers. Nothing I have tried has worked until now. I purchased this item n 2 weeks later, its about 50% lighter. At first it seemed to have gotten darker but then it started pealing n noticed a difference within the first week. The only other item that has worked for me besides this item was the Cosmelan treatment but very expensive n you need at least 2 weeks off work. The cosmelan was abt 500 and the maintenance cream is 150.00. For 30.00 this is way better in price n didnt have to take iff work. I cant wait until the day, I dont need to wear heavy make-up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 44 and have been trying to get rid an age spot under my eye for a few years now.  I&#x27;ve tried many products but never saw any difference.  I was a little skeptical that this product would work, but the reviews were pretty good and the price was reasonable so I decided to give it a try - and I&#x27;m so glad I did.  After using it for 10 days the spot was completely gone!  It did burn a little when I put on and it was a little red for a few days, but for me it was worth it. I&#x27;m so glad I finally found something that works.</li>
            <li> I have Melasma, and this products has done a great job lightening it. I would recommend this product :) Jenn</li>
            <li> I am an aa and have been suffering from hyperpigmentation under my armpits for several years.  I could not wear sleeveless or bathing suits for fear of showing my armpits.  After two uses, my hyperpigmented areas literally wiped off in the shower.  This is a wonderful product.  I&#x27;ve spent so much money seeing dermatologist, and trying other products.  The only warning I would have is that this product is strong and works quickly.  So when you use it, apply with a really thin layer.</li>
            <li> I have pretty severe Melasma on my face. I have watched it age me in the last couple years. I have used many different fade creams and have been disappointed in the results. I&#x27;ve paid for very expensive solutions from doctors and did not feel they were worth the money. I did a search for &amp;#34;best solutions for melasma&amp;#34; and this popped up. I&#x27;ve never heard of this brand but the reviews were good enough for me to try it. (Someone said their doctor recommended it and I took that as a free consultation :). I&#x27;ve used this product a month and I definitely see a difference. It did NOT work as quickly as I expected but over time, I am seeing a difference. I would say it&#x27;s a 25% improvement but it&#x27;s only been a month so I&#x27;m happy with that. I&#x27;ve learned that with improving your skin, patience is the key. I would also say that the overall appearance of my skin is much improved since I&#x27;ve been using this. I will definitely order this again as this is the most improvement I&#x27;ve seen from any product I&#x27;ve tried for Melasma. I bought the MD oil free sunscreen together with this product. Make sure you use a very good sunscreen when you use Porcelain.</li>
            <li> No effect on my skin.  used it regularly for several months coupled with religious sunblock use to keep the melasma from getting darker.  I did not see any improvement. This gets added to the list of products that have not produced results for me.</li>
            <li> This made my hyperpigmentation worse. It grew larger and daker. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I loke this. cause now thre is no signs of improvement of face. I don&#x27;t know how long the result will be. now my face its&lt;br /&gt;the same. I have been using I think 2 months.</li>
            <li> This is the only remedy for melasma I have tried that didn&#x27;t burn my skin beyond my comfort level.  I have used it a month and the brown spots on my face have faded by at least 75%.  I use a high-number sunscreen every single day and apply the Porcelain serum at night, as instructed.  I am delighted with this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Procelain since the last week of June, and have found it to be more effective than two other previous products. A large brownish spot on my left arm has noticeably faded using this. The spot has been there for a couple of years, and in fact, I had been using .  4% pure Hydroquinone on it before as prescribed by my dermatologist. I did that for several months and it never changed. Whereas Procelain, with 2% Hydroquinone, HAS made a difference! It&#x27;s also helped on a light brown area above my chin. This area became a bit red from the serum, but that disappeared after a day or two. My arm got a tad red too. A small amount of skin peeling occurred as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For ME, it seems to be working.</li>
            <li> Item works.  But not the dramatic results that I expected.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t really do much for me. I still have spots of hyperpigmentation.</li>
            <li> Did not work for me. However i used it for acne since it makes my skin extremely dry.</li>
            <li> have not seen any results with this product on my dark spots.will not purchase this again.how about some of my money back</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product. I have been battling with hyperpigmentation for over 5 years. Through the years I found that hydroquinone is the ingredient that works faster on lightning my skin. This product contains hydroquinone with other natural ingredients for lightning skin. I believe this is a great formula. In 2 weeks i saw significant results, and on the 3rd week I am very impressed. Took pictures on my first day and compared it to show my friends. Great product!</li>
            <li> This is working very well for me. I am 58 years old and my skin was showing sun worshipping damage in a big way. I gave up the sun over a year ago and with my skin returning to its natural color, boy did the sun damage show! I started using this product along with ROC product and WOW. I am very pleased with the results. I have been using it for 3 weeks and I am still peelng. I am so pleased with the feel of my skin and the brown spots are disappearing. I am not sure if I would have as good results without the combination of the 2 products.</li>
            <li> I have used this product as indicated for 6 months. My burn scar remains exactly the same. It was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> It is very slow removing dark spots.  I need something stronger and faster to remove dark spots from my legs.</li>
            <li> Did not make a visible change.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month now I haven&#x27;t really noticed any changes to my skin. I&#x27;ve been too my freckles look lighter but I can&#x27;t see it. I had really high hopes for this product with all it&#x27;s active ingredients it makes it sound very good and convinces you that it will work but overall not all that happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This stuff actually works.  Will use for the rest of my life.  Thank you thank you thank you.  My melasma went away so much I barely see traces of it.  Only product so far that does what it says.</li>
            <li> I had developed pretty severe melasma on my forehead over the past year. I was considering taking out a credit car to pay for a series of lazar treatments to lighten it up. It would have cost me thousands of dollars. The melasma aged me a lot and really bothered me. I decided to try this product because it had good reviews and was way less expensive than the lazar treatments. It worked! I used it every night for about 6 weeks and my melasma is 98% gone. I couldn&#x27;t believe something this inexpensive could be so effective. This is the best cosmetic product that I have ever bought.</li>
            <li> Best gel ever. Has everything drs prescribed but in on little jar instead of 3 tubes.</li>
            <li> Satisfied !!!!! Thank You !!!!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything. I think I just waited money on, yey, another product that didn&#x27;t live up to it&#x27;s claim!</li>
            <li> THis stuff seems to be the truth- My butt had that terrible darkness- I don&#x27;t what to call it- I guess it&#x27;s from all that baby powder our parents used as  children-- Anyway, within 3 days, the skin on my derriere matched the rest of my body-- TMI? Maybe, but thought you&#x27;d like to know</li>
            <li> I have confidence in this product, I will post results in the future.</li>
            <li> I have used other hydroquinone products without great results, but the description of this product sounded promising,  so I ordered it. Within 2 or 3 days I noticed marked lightening of the areas I wanted to treat. My skin looked overall nice where I applied it, so now I kind of sweep a bit all over, to even skintone in general. I would definitely recommend this product !</li>
            <li> waste of money dont buy</li>
            <li> Package  received on time ,im using it for 2.5 weeks this serum peeled my face really good.im happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Well I can say I am seeing results from this product. I have hyperpigmentation (HP) on top of my left eyebrow, and a little on the right side as well. I don&#x27;t like the way it looks. (picture mike tyson eyebrow tattoo) It&#x27;s looks like that except it&#x27;s a dark botch of skin.&lt;br /&gt;Well im a guy so im not trying to whiten my face, just get rid of this ridiculous look i gotten from too much sun exposure.&lt;br /&gt;When i put it on there is a light burning sensation, nothing too painful and redness when i wake up the next morning. Then later on some flaking on the area i applied the serum. After a few days I notice the HP gotten darker and stands out more than it usually does. The skin looks rough and dark. And it&#x27;s peels like crazy. It goes on for a week or two (and people stare at my forehead), but then the new skin underneath is lighten and softer looking. It works! but I have notice it does make any area you applied sensitive to sunlight. So stay away from the sun like you&#x27;re a vampire. Or put a lot of sunscreen if you can&#x27;t avoid the daystar.&lt;br /&gt;The product doesn&#x27;t get rid of it completely but it is a lot less noticeable then before. Maybe I haven&#x27;t used it long enough. But overall i give it 4 stars. I took away 1 star due to the price of this product. It&#x27;s a little expensive if you ask me. Also some of the ingredient is carcinogenic so assess the product and ask yourself if you&#x27;re feelin lucky.</li>
            <li> For  years  I&#x27;ve  tried  all  sorts  of  treatments  on  my  melasma,  even  what  my  doctor  recently  prescibed  here  in  the  UK  (they  have  now  banned  the  medical  use  of  hydroquinone  for  skin  treatment  in  the  UK).  This  melasma  is  just  the  hardest  thing  to  get  rid  of!  Anyway,  after  4  weeks  of  using  Porcelain,  I  think  I&#x27;m  seeing  a  tiny  difference,  so  I  will  keep  on  using  it  and  will  post  another  comment  in  time  to  come.  I&#x27;m  giving  it  3  stars  for  the  moment,  but  I  do  hope  I  will  have  reason  to  give  it  5  in  the  future.  What  I  can  say  is  that  it&#x27;s  long  lasting  and  absorbs  well.</li>
            <li> Kinda burned and irritated my skin but that as because it has active ingredients that go below your outer skin layer and I guess I am too sensitive. Seller was very nice and gave me a hassle free refund. I passed it onto my mother. Will update how it suited her.</li>
            <li> Helps a little, but not like I thought it would. Makes my skin very smooth though.</li>
            <li> Good results, my fourth bottle</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t wastes money on this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about two weeks and it is working for me, so far. To avoid itching and get better skin cleansing results, I will be using microfiber face cloths. I have used complexion soaps and cremes in the past, hoping I wouldn&#x27;t have to go further but, I had to. I am glad, I did. It is perfect for me. The serum is non-greasy, it absorbs completely into my skin so, I don&#x27;t have any break-outs using it. I use a small amount of raw shea butter before applying a small amount (thin layer) of the serum, in order to, sooth and protect my sensitive skin. I have had hyper-pigmentation due to the results of prescribed acne medications from dermatologists and even with the direction to use sunscreen. After a time of all of that, my skin is sensitive and I have multiple areas of bad skin discolorations. Specifically for me through my years of that for my skin type (milk chocolate), I have noticed that any type of alcohol doesn&#x27;t agree with my skin and does cause it to become even more darkened or yield no change; tea tree oil is no better. So with this regimen, I will be completely avoiding products that contain them.    Update: Now three weeks have gone by, I have noticed darkening of my skin in areas where, I repeatedly tried more than a thin layer of serum. I wanted to test the strength and effectiveness of the product. I won&#x27;t be trying that again. Thankfully, for me the product is really gentle so, there weren&#x27;t any worse effects no other than the darkening of the area.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it about a month I can tell the difference, seams not even out my skin tone,and didn&#x27;t dry my face out or make it peel. I have dry skin so most things make me peel.</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t met my expectations so far, and I&#x27;ve been using it for the past 3 weeks now. Although I broke out in rash initially,  and I used hydrocortisone to cleared it off. I&#x27;m disappointed considering the amount that I paid, and still hasn&#x27;t seen any effect yet.</li>
            <li> this product does not work</li>
            <li> I got it early which is a plus and I use it on self harm scars.. So far I have noticed a few are lighter but not much.. I&#x27;ve only been using this stuff for about maybe 2 weeks so still have faith.!</li>
            <li> Love this product!  Not too harsh.  Skin feels great.</li>
            <li> ...but I don&#x27;t really care. It works! I&#x27;m a black man who had severe acne as a teenager. Understand that I have used TONS of different products to try and get rid of my hyperpigmented scars, all without success. However there&#x27;s something about the way this product combines the bleaching agents with the glycol acid that does the job. Although I&#x27;ll never have pristine, smooth skin, this has made a significant difference in my appearance.</li>
            <li> I am a AA female that has been dealing with the effects of acne scarring &amp; dark spots for some time now. I probably have spent close to $10,000 on face products alone &amp; I can honestly tell you that this product works. I was kind of hesitant to buy it because of the name. I am a dark skinned female &amp; I love the skin I&#x27;m in. I did not want to lighten my skin, I just wanted a more even complexion. Within 2 weeks of using I started seeing results. And I will continue to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing is my face did start to peel but I think that is normal. I started using this product every night, however, I use it every other night to every two nights now.</li>
            <li> Hello All, I have to say I love this product! I have been using it for three days and my skin is a half shade lighter. I am not only using this product I wash my face with fair and white (AHA orange box), take glutathione 1500 mg (by Ivory caps) and this stuff. My skin was look pretty good and lighting but I wanted something stronger for my face. However, I know that the soap was working wonderful and I saw lighting and glutathione whites you gradually but you do see results in two weeks, however adding this to the mix my face is whiter, brighter, and I had a few guys staring. I&#x27;m already a goodlooking attractive female but that glow, makes my skin look flawless. I use fair and white lotion for my body. I want to have that medium honey brown complexsion, and looks like I&#x27;ll be getting there sooner ( and yes I love myself, I just love glowing skin, so don&#x27;t get it twisted)....! Its worthy it, you have to have a great soap as well! Will be buying again.[[ASIN:B009JJA49U Procelain Skin Whitening Serum Hydroquinone Kojic Acid Glycolic Acid Vitamin C Licorice Mulberry Extract for Melasma, Hyperpigmentation 2oz]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: The product is still working wonders! My complexion is a shade lighter, and I barely have blemishes! Goodluck! Happy Healthy skin journey to you all! Thank you, Thank you, Thank you!</li>
            <li> I have been using this products for 2 weeks - once a day on weekdays and twice a day on weekends. So far, no peeling yet. I have not seen any improvement on the discoloration on my face yet either. Oh, I have sensitive combination skin. Maybe it does not work well with combo skin. I will continue using it for a couple more weeks. Will keep you update.</li>
            <li> My moles and melanoma looking moles peeled off but trying to get rid of my freckles! Not sure if it works but def. Stay away from the sun while using and even hot yoga is not goood! Your face will burn!</li>
            <li> I have seen a very slight change so far but I have only been using it for a little over a month.</li>
            <li> I had tempered expectations for dealing with my melasma. However, I&#x27;m nearly 3 weeks into using this product, and it&#x27;s working. The brown areas are gradually beginning to fade. I will use it until the bottle is gone, but I wanted to give a preliminary report.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very fair, sensitive, and acne-prone skin. I have not noticed excessive peeling, redness or irritation. The product has a serum consistency. There is no noticeable odor. I have not broken out from the product. And as I said, my stubborn melasma seems to be responding. Honestly, this price for a 2 oz. bottle of product with these ingredients is pretty fabulous. Customer service is awesome. Can&#x27;t believe how fast the delivery was. I will finish the bottle and will try to update my review with the final results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6/16/13 update. I&#x27;m so impressed with this product. I still have about half the bottle left. With summer being in full swing, I&#x27;m taking a break from use. I&#x27;m using sunscreen as faithfully as possible, and figure I&#x27;ll go back to using the product for damage control. (The return factor with melasma is one of the most annoying traits.) But my results were pretty fantastic for a topical product. I&#x27;d say my melasma is about 5 - 10% of what it once was, and it&#x27;s probably only noticeable to me. I did try laser treatment a year or so ago, which did give even better results. However, that&#x27;s very expensive and my melasma came back with sun exposure. (Frustrating!) I would rather have a product like this in my toolbox that I can use when necessary. When the bottle is gone I will definitely reorder, which is the greatest testament.is considered as normal. It is the result of alpha hydroxy acid exfoliating the epidermis and brings newer, clearer skin to the surface. Mild redness is also expected as the normal skin renewing process, as the active ingredients are effectively penetrating into the deeper layers of the skin and targeting skin discoloration to its core. You will notice the dark spots begin to gradually fade as your skin begins to peel and the active ingredients penetrate your skin.&lt;br /&gt;* One bottle typically lasts about 1 month depending on size of brown spots. Second treatment is not necessary if you have reached desired results after one treatment. For hydroquinone serum, if you have not reached desired results after first treatment, allow a week of rest before initiating new treatment.&lt;br /&gt;* For your skin protection, avoid excessive sun exposure and always use sunscreen before and during sun exposure when using treatment. Do not perform any glycolic peels or strong skin treatments during the treatment.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product on April 16, 2013.  I assumed it was like all the rest of the acne scar/dark spot products out there, but I was not giving up just yet.  I received this and tried it that night.  I was afraid that if it was too strong or more like a peel, i would wake up with red spots or blisters on my face and chin.  Well, I have been using the serum every morning and night [unless I forgot] - I simply washed my face and applied the serum to my chin area and around the mouth area.  I have olive skin and have acne scar over the 50+ years of my life. I never thought i would be writing this review, let alone writing it this so soon after receiving the serum.  I would love to buy it by the quart for my arms and legs that are getting old and blotchy.  I would recommend this product.  It is not harsh to the skin, absorbs readily, great under makeup, and best of all works!</li>
            <li> Have been using the product twice daily as directed  for over a month and my one dark facial spot has not gotten any lighter. I was really hoping this product lived up to its lclaims but after a month the only thing I am experiences is minor redness and brief burning when I apply it to my face. Brown spot had not faded or lightened.</li>
            <li> Been using it everyday, but see a very tiny difference and its been a month. The consistency is easy to spread over skin and isn&#x27;t sticky or greasy. Absorbs right into the skin. Overall it&#x27;s okay, Ill keep using it till I run out, then maybe find something a little stronger.</li>
            <li> I cannot tell you how happy I am with this product.  Definitely worth a try if you are feeling mortified by discoloration due to the sun induced melasma!  I actually discontinued use after only 5 nights of applying it because the discoloration is almost unnoticable now... even to my biggest critic, me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wrote this review as a thank you to all the other reviews/postings I poured over when I was searching for ANYTHING that would help. So, after years of trying tons of products to figure out the perfect blend, I thought I&#x27;d also include my exact regiment in case you are feeling helpless and like nothing will work to make you feel beautiful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 - Apply Aquaphor advanced healing moisturizer over any parts of the face that are dry:&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/AQUAPHOR-OINTMENT-ADV-THERAPY-Size/dp/B00027NZHG/ref&#x3D;sr_1_4?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1371612350&amp;sr&#x3D;8-4&amp;keywords&#x3D;aquaphor+advanced+therapy+healing+ointment&lt;br /&gt;2 - Apply Solbar sunscreen SPF 38 w/ zinc over entire face:&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Solbar-SOLBAR-Zinc-SPF38/dp/B000GG13TU/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1371612259&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;solbar+zinc+spf+38&lt;br /&gt;3 - Apply NP Set Concealer stick over the entire upper lip area, even the non-affected spots.  I use a shade lighter than what naturally blends with my skin.&lt;br /&gt; http://www.amazon.com/Np-Set-Concealer-Look-0-5-ounce/dp/B002LDUSOM/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1371611979&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;np+set+concealer&lt;br /&gt;4 - Brush on appropriate shade of M.A.C. Face and Body Foundation. It&#x27;s so light you barely feel it and it looks natural.&lt;br /&gt; http://www.amazon.com/Np-Set-Concealer-Look-0-5-ounce/dp/B002LDUSOM/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1371611979&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;np+set+concealer&lt;br /&gt;For what it is worth I have found that the Sephora Brush #56 does a great job at applying the foundation, keeping it light, well blended, and natural looking. http://www.amazon.com/SEPHORA-COLLECTION-Pro-Flawless-Airbrush/dp/B008H1IDXU/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1371612736&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;sephora+brush+56&lt;br /&gt;5 - Gently brush face with a DRY (completely product free) general face or bronzer brush.  This helps your face look less shiny/ more matted and natural.  Something like this:&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/e-l-f-Cosmetics-83404-Studio-kabuki/dp/B00373HS7K/ref&#x3D;sr_1_2?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1371613535&amp;sr&#x3D;8-2&amp;keywords&#x3D;bronzer+brush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems like a lot, but it is really simple once you do it and these products will last you forever.  It is an investment that is worth so much to me in the confidence I am able to exude because my skin looks evenly toned and I don&#x27;t feel like people can even notice the discoloration that I was so self conscious about.  Good luck!</li>
            <li> This product lightened my sister&#x27;s dark melasma with first use.  Quick results!  No side effects.  Doesn&#x27;t bleach clothing or cause acne.  Really wonderful product.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t do much of anything, sadly. Maybe I&#x27;m too pale to notice a result, but I saw no improvement at all.</li>
            <li> Quick turn around.  Good product.</li>
            <li> It seems the biggest part of the dark spot in my face is removed , but there are some small small tiny spots scattered</li>
            <li> I have a slight case of melasma and with this cream I&#x27;ve been able to really keep it under control. Living in Las Vegas where the sun is all the time it&#x27;s hard to avoid the sun, but with this cream I can enjoy myself again outside. Don&#x27;t need to put on a lot at night it goes a long long way, I bought 6mons ago and still have so much left, I put on every night before bed after I wash my face. Make sure to wash off before you go outside and don&#x27;t put tons on you can get dry skin, other then that this is the best cream ever with actual results.</li>
            <li> I use this daily, and have almost used the entire bottle.  No change.  Save your money.</li>
            <li> I am an African American woman and have struggled with my skin for the last 5 years. I&#x27;ve spent hundreds of dollars going to medical spas and doctors trying to figure out what was happening to my face. I was told several things from stress to increased hormone activity after I turned 40. I started breaking out on my entire face with the exception of my forehead. I had acne scars EVERYWHERE on my face. I&#x27;ve been using porcelain skin whitening serum for the last two weeks and WOW! The first night I used it I woke up and noticed some peeling. I wash my skin twice a day so that night I washed my face and used an organic honey mask. The product exfoliated my skin IN THE TROUBLE spots with just one use! I had soooo much dead skin which was causing my face to have an overall uneven apperance. In the past I used products like hydroquinone ranging from 6% to 12%, AHA, and BHA and using these products alone or together was a disaster and caused even more damage! This product uses a variety of ingredients that create a synergetic effect and they really work without lightening your face only in certain areas. I will recommend this to friends and family and will definitely keep using it! Please don&#x27;t over look this gem because of the price! I have spent hundreds of dollars on high end products which I won&#x27;t name but this was an amazingly fast inexpensive treatment for me and as a black woman that&#x27;s saying a lot.</li>
            <li> When I followed the directions and put it on for 2 days, I broke out. I loaded up on Eucerin q10 anti wrinkle and my skin cleared. I tried it again a wk later for just one day. I peeled a little without breaking out. I tried it again the following wk w a one time application. The results are minimal. I notice a slight lightening to my dark patches of melasma, but not significant enough to stop using foundation. I&#x27;m Latina w light tan skin.</li>
            <li> This is some Strong stuff use with coution. but IT WORKS.</li>
            <li> I have been a looking for the right product to get rid of my acne scars the issue with that was that I also have sensitive skin so the products would break me out but this was so different. I do get usual pimples but that is not surprising. I really do like this product and you should go out there and buy one. I do say when using this product keep up with your exfoliation.</li>
            <li> This product exceeds my expectations.  I had a huge hyperpigmentation issue that I could not keep hidden under make up.  It was so bad people would tell me I had dirt on my face nearly every day due to having nearly black splotches from malasma.  Now I can go without foundation and not be self concious!  I have never found anything at a store that has this set of ingredients.  I will never order a different serum because this one has been like a miracle for my face!!</li>
            <li> Does the job. My age spot is a lot lighter compared to before I started using this product. I don&#x27;t recommend to the person with sensitive skin since this one somewhat irritates during the process. But if you are like me, with healthy and good skin condition other then some blemishes, this will do the job.</li>
            <li> Great service.  Have not seen a change in my skin, but just started using it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this serum about two months ago because I have a lot of acne scars from when I had severe acne in my teenage years on my cheeks. After about three days I started noticing the spots fading away, even my family noticed! It also leaves your skin feeling smooth. The only recommendation that I have is when using this serum only use it in the troubled area because it will lighten up your skin and you do not want to have an uneven skin tone.</li>
            <li> My skin is delicate perioral area, but it product exfoliates my skin very well.&lt;br /&gt;I am satisfied with this product</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t blame the serum, because my skin has been discolored for many years.  The melasma  has affected the deep layers of my skin, and hydroquinone doesn&#x27;t work for me. My dermatologist said it was very unlikely that anything would help.  However, I was hoping the other ingredients in the serum, that I had seen in my research, would make a difference.  They didn&#x27;t. I stopped using the serum when small areas on each side of my mouth lost color.  The severe discoloration did not improve at all.  I think people with mild  discoloration may be helped.</li>
            <li> great serum, excelent results, leaves the face with a withening effect and great look and also great price. I recommend it,</li>
            <li> I absolutley love this! Went to the dermatologist for freckles and dark spots on my face was perscribed medicated cream and with my insurace would cost me over 180$. Started doing some research and came across this product figured I would give it a try and the price was not bad. After almost 2 weeks of use my dark spots have nearly vanished!! I would recommend this product to anyone instead of the the expensive perscription drugs that dont offer this good of result!!</li>
            <li> I was late in receiving it.. so what ever.. I was excited to try it..  it is horrible it has ruined my face.. my face is like a grater now. white spots all over and I have broken out all over my face.!  I look like a teenager with acne.&lt;br /&gt;this is not a good product. it sounds really good BUT IT IS NOT! DON&#x27;T BUY IT</li>
            <li> works very well. freckles are almost gone. very happy</li>
            <li> I just received this product last week. I took a picture before I used the product. Applied it on the first night. The next morning, I saw a visible improvement on my melasma, the color lightened and I have been using it continuously for 4 days. My melasma is almost gone.  I am so glad all of you has shared the feedback and because of your feedback, I am willing to try this reasonable price product. I have bought another one last weekend for my friend and will continue recommending it to all friends and family members who has stubborn freckles and melasma.</li>
            <li> I have been battling melasma for about 8 years.  I started with IPL&#x27;s not very good success. I have used hydroquinone off and on over the years as well as other prescription products with no luck.  I have a series of 3 to 4 TCA peels in the fall and winter which help to lighten it during those months.  I wanted to try a product that had more natural ingredients in it.  Found this online and wanted to try it.  It did absolutely nothing for my condition.  Was going to send it back for a refund but missed the send back date.  I don&#x27;t know if this product would help just dark spots but I cant recommend it for the big problem- MELASMA.&lt;br /&gt;Becky</li>
            <li> This product does not work for dark spots or pigmentation.&lt;br /&gt;I did not see any difference with use of this product.</li>
            <li> To be fair, I have not tried this product yet. I am waiting for cooler temperatures as I bought this in the summer.  Will start using it in the fall when it&#x27;s not as hot or humid.</li>
            <li> I have only had this for a few days but can tell that it is doing the job. Yes, there will be some flaking of your skin but honestly, it&#x27;s nothing I haven&#x27;t experienced before. Would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> This product does nothing but irritates skin. Don&#x27;t buy it. My skin was red and irritated from use, but there was no improvement (I took photos before I started using it!) and I used up more than half a bottle, hoping that it will eventually work. Save yourself the money and buy a different product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is incredible ! I have had a dark age spot on my cheek for a few years now. It was the size of just smaller than a dime. It had always bothered me; I&#x27;d cover it up with foundation and concealer. A dermatologist suggested I use the bleaching cream that they sell at their office....it did nothing for me. I finally decided to have my spot lasered off. My cheek looked awesome two weeks later, but literally a month later, the dark spot came back! ...and yes, I was using sunscreen SPF 60 ! My friend told me to go back to the dermatologist to have the treatment done again. I opted not to and instead researched the best way to remove dark spots. I read about hydroquinone to be one of the best options for treatment. I searched Amazon for the product and came upon this one. IT IS AMAZING ! I&#x27;ve used it nightly as instructed since receiving the product about 2 weeks ago. My age spot is almost gone! Absolutely incredible!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, after about a half hour, I put some German-made Nivea cream on the spot, which I&#x27;ve read is similar to La Mer creams. It could be the combination of the two that&#x27;s helped me achieve what I&#x27;ve been wanting to get rid of for so long.</li>
            <li> Great results for severe melasma after only 6 weeks of daily use! I will be ordering more when this one runs out.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the last six months and I only saw a slight difference on my skin.  I thought that sometimes diffeent types of skins react differently I decided to give this product another try, so I  just reorded it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for almost a month and have noticed my melisma fading.  It is not prescription strength so it is working slower than what my dermatologist prescribed but for an over the counter product it works.  I do apply a 30 SPF facial primer every day which helps prevent spots from darkening again. I have had no reaction to this product.  I apply to a clean face with a cotton ball where the melisma (brown spots) are at night.  I have missed a few nights off and on but overall I do notice a decrease in the dark spots. I am medium skin tone.</li>
            <li> Love it!! My spots are melting and my face it&#x27;s so smooth.</li>
            <li> The first night I used it I noticed the next day my hyperpigmentation seemed a little faded. I was so thrilled. But after using it for 4 nights in a row it broke me out in all the areas I used it. I&#x27;m so disappointed! I also am peeling slightly but I expected that. I think I&#x27;m going to try this again when my skin clears up because I really want it to work! I will post again if I have luck with this product.</li>
            <li> Works well but you have to keep at it. It can irritate the skin and can make sun-damaged spots worse.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 3 weeks.  I have noticed a remarkable difference in my skin color.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it lightens my spots, I didn&#x27;t take before pics</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an African American woman early 50&#x27;s who&#x27;s developed moderate hyperpigmentation.  Just a few spots but they are deep &amp; hard to fade. I&#x27;ve used prescription products through my dermatologist for a few years but decided to try something new. Porcelain seems to be working--1st bottle, 1/2 used-- but you have to be patient.</li>
            <li> OK, I hear people saying, &amp;#34;Oh it worked in a  week. That is wrong. This like this takes 2 week to start working so stop the crap!&lt;br /&gt;Now, let&#x27;s get the ratting. I have been using it for 3 week and I can tell you their is a 50% difference! I have a several spot 2 on my arm.  They are much better with in the 3 week of using it so the way I looks now. I would they well be gone in another 2-3 weeks. I hate the top of my foot. I don&#x27;t know what hit it, but I left a dark brose. I got his like dime size mark on the top of my foot. It taking a little longer to work ... but it is working! I&#x27;m very happy with this product!  IT DOES WORK!!</li>
            <li> So far the Product show good  result but it is still early to  give full judgment. I used it for 14 days and i can see stubborn melasma is fading away, these melasma have been residing on my face and never welcome any types of lightening medication.  My dermatologist advised me medications ranged from mild to strong whitening serum, cream and gel, none of them worked so far very expensive one (30 ml for 200$) .&lt;br /&gt; i was fed up and i was thinking to find a surgery to remove the skin even though i know it is not practically possible but look how bad and frustrated was my situation that I was seeking for anything which is promising to heal this issue. It is good to note that my melasma is due to excessive sun exposure and even using the sun block doesn’t help.&lt;br /&gt;I can say now I am feeling better ,the first  few night after I applied  the serum it  was really uncomfy as I have feeling of burning on my skin but it was expected. I am feeling much better now, I am trying to minimize sun exposure and religiously I am applying It once a  day (normally at night before  go to bed). I really can see the difference. Hope it will last&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will update you soon for the final results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to accurately assess at this point in time as I have only been using this product about two weeks now.&lt;br /&gt;I have a bad case of melanoma so I have to wait a bit longer and see what the results will be.  However my skin is beginning to look&lt;br /&gt;smoother and slightly clearer.</li>
            <li> I am Very happy with this product, love it!! I really see the change in the spots!! the chipping was on time, perfect delivery</li>
            <li> This stuff is incredible.  I use it daily and it really works.  It has lightened pigmentation spots and acne scars on my face and is the only stuff I&#x27;ve tried that works.</li>
            <li> I have some brown spots from a past pregnancy and sun damage, and was eager to find something to lighten them. I was hesitant to try this product. The label looks homemade, in a bad way (words cut off, etc). Against my better judgement, I tried it, and after a few days, I started noticing significant lightening. But, ultimately, I couldn&#x27;t get over the fact the the presentation made me not trust the product, and Iit made me nervous putting it on my skin everyday, so I chose to stop using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a week and I&#x27;ve seen about a 15% reduction of my Melasma. As a long time sufferer of Melasma I have great hopes for this product. For those with super sensitive skin I will add that there can be a slight peeling on affected areas but I&#x27;ve not experienced any other reactions.</li>
            <li> This is less that 1 week i am using.  I can swear to confirm that i do see good results of whitening of my melsama and uneven skintone.  I will continue to use it till end of earth as long it can maintain a clear white porcelain skin.  I will be the happiest old woman with clear white porcelain skin on earth. hahahaha!!!! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will it be good if i continue using even i have already obtain a good clear translucent skin?  Or do i need to slow down by using it alternate days or one week 2 to 3 times eventually?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you and appreciate your precious advice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regards&lt;br /&gt;Chelsa</li>
            <li> This product is awesome. I only used it for 2 weeks and my skin feels tighter and smoother. It also lightened up my sun spots on my cheeks! Definitely use sunscreen. Redness and light peeling may occur.</li>
            <li> I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT FOR ABOUT THREE WEEKS. THIS IS THE FIRST PRODUCT THAT EVER HELP WITH MY MALASMA.  MY SKIN IS LOOKING GREAT FOR THE FIRST TIME IN YEARS. ANOTHER THING THAT I CAN SAY THAT MADE THIS PRODUCT WORK SOO EFFECTIVELY IS THAT I DID RESEARCH ABOUT MALASMA AND FOUND OUT THAT THE SUN CAN MAKE THE PROBLEM WORSE. SO I HAVE BEEN USING SUNSCREEN DAILY, AND REAPPLYING IT OFTEN.  I  ALSO AVOID GOING OUTSIDE WHEN THE SUN IS AT ITS BRIGHTEST.</li>
            <li> At first I was seeing a big difference in my post acne marks but then it started burn my skin and break me out. My skin is very sensitive and I am not able to use this product anymore.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve suffered from melasma for 4 years now and nothing has worked.  This did nothing to lighten it.</li>
            <li> i haven&#x27;t seen any changes,and therefore i am not going to give it a good review..i am sending it back...everyone skin is different and perhaps it works for others,however,its a no for me...</li>
            <li> Dark/age spots on hands began fading after a week. After a month 95% of spots not visible and unless you are looking very closely the spots on my hands are gone.</li>
            <li> did not really see any real effect.&lt;br /&gt; will not rec. this product to others&lt;br /&gt; thank you very much.&lt;br /&gt; not satisfied</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an african american woman who&#x27;s complexion is the same as Queen Latifah&#x27;s. I have acne blemishes on my cheeks and the products i&#x27;ve purchased in the past (too many to name) barely gave me any satisfying results. I&#x27;ve only been using this new product for 4 days and I almost want to cry tears of joy. The color of my dark DARK, stubborn acne blemishes that have plagued my checks are now breaking down and the color is fading from dark brown to now, reddish brown in only 4 days! I have to be honest. Ive used at night before bed, than again in the middle of the night. DONT DO THAT! FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS AS THE MARKS WILL STILL FADE! I have some slight redness going on BUT thats my fault. I&#x27;m gonna skip a day to give my skin a chance to calm down but im telling you, this is a miracle in a bottle! I dont work for the company, have never heard of the company or the brand but the reviews prompted me to purchase the product. I&#x27;m soooooo happy i did! I dont even have to wear as much foundatin anymore. At this rate, within another week, I&amp;#34;ll be able to get away with using just a bronzer. If you have struggled with blemishes, I would strongly recommend this product. The best ive ever used in over 15 years! Thank you NAKED FACE!</li>
            <li> Great, it is good product seems to be lightening the dark spot, my skin was breakout , it is really working well for me for me, i need more time to see the lightening</li>
            <li> I like this product so much because it is helping remove the dark spots and melasma on my face. I am a 53 year old Asian woman with medium skin tone and I wear make up foundation to cover my ugly dark spots and I really put a lot over my melasma--now I don&amp;#34;t need too much makeup because my skin tone is more even. It is probably not good for people with sensitive skin; it does have a stinging sensation after application.  I don&#x27;t write reviews for products but this product deserves it.  It has lighten my melasma-- I went to a dermatologist and he prescribed a 4% hydroquinone product which did nothing for me and it costs too much, this product works fast and the price is worth every penny for me because it works!  I will throw away all the other products that don&#x27;t work. I started seeing results after two days of using it. Yes your skin will peel off getting rid of the old skin and bringing in the new skin.  We all have different skin types and I found something that really works for me. Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this product. I HAD major melasma on my cheeks, forehead and chin - my skin is not completely clear, but my gosh! I can see such improvement in not only clarity, but also in skin texture; acne scarred skin is now smmooth!! My skin is almost so even that I can wear tinted face cream and get away with it - and all within just a couple of weeks of use!! I apply this product every night and wear 100spf during the day. So happy and thankful for this product</li>
            <li> I have dark skin and I have been using the serum for about three weeks now and already see a marked difference. This product works!</li>
            <li> Did not work well on my malasma.</li>
            <li> I really feel that I need to let others know how well this worked for me. After trying a Neutragena and Aveeno product, I was disappointed that they weren&#x27;t working and unless I underwent some expensive laser treatment, I was just going to have to accept that the melasma on my face was just a fact of life. I got results after about a week and a half of trying the Porcelain serum. The serum was not super harsh on my skin. It did cause the treated area to peel(it&#x27;s supposed to), but it was not excessively harsh, it was kind of like the peeling that happens after a minor sun burn. The skin started to peel revealing a much newer, lighter skin. Warning: Excited about my new complexion, I got a little ahead of myself and exfoliated with my supersonic spin brush and had to stop using the serum for a bit because the strong exfoliating irritated the area, so don&#x27;t make the same mistake I did!! My skin looks so much better now. The spots are not completely gone, but significantly faded to where make-up covers it up very well, and that&#x27;s after only treating it for about 2 weeks, whereas the other stuff didn&#x27;t do anything after 8 weeks of religious use!! I am actually starting to treat what&#x27;s left of the spots now that my skin has healed from over-exfoliating. If you purchase the serum, definitely purchase a high SPF sunblock to wear regularly as well. I also am giving it five stars for fast shipping and for it being a nice sized bottle. I paid around $20 for the 1oz serums by Neutrogena/Aveeno and this bottle is 2oz for around $30. Great product, you must try if you are dealing with stubborn melasma spots!</li>
            <li> I would not advise anyone with sensitive skin to try this product. I do not consider my skin to be sensitive (as I have never had any problems before) but, this product burned my skin. I do not mean that Il even feel it burning but, I experienced darkened and reddened areas on the few spots on my face that I applied it making them look much worse. All of this took place after only one use.I definitely am not pleased with  this purchase and although I did not send it back my friend said it worked for her so she received it from me as gift.</li>
            <li> ....so I am taking the time to write a review because it is very much deserved for this product!  I have melasma on my upper lip which made me self conscious. It really looked like I had hair there that I did not take care of!  I did lots of research and read up on my condition and found out what sort of products work for this condition.  I fell upon this product and read the reviews and was impressed! I also felt secure in ordering the product because of the return policy they had, awesome.  I figured I had nothing to lose and placed the order. Product came quickly with great informative paperwork that I read carefully.  I followed the directions and applied this product on clean face at night and oh my that next morning my skin was lighter and peeling off, renewing itself! I applied this product nightly on my upper lip now for a week &amp; 2 days and there have been great results! My melasma has lightened dramatically ( I should have taken before and after pictures). :) :) now warning: there is a bit of discomfort, I experienced redness and burning but it is tolerable. I am so glad I tried this product!!  My melasma has lightened so much that you can NOT tell I had a sun mustache, so happy!!&lt;br /&gt;Date July 17th:  (following up again) I am so glad that this product is in my arsenal kit for this melasma condition.  Melasma is very stubborn and I have learned that you MUST wear sunscreen even for the five minutes that you will be outside regardless if it is sunny or not especially in the summer months!!  The sunscreen must MUST contain zinc oxide or titanium dioxide for it to be effective on melasma, any old sunscreen will not work!  I have had the skin darken up again on my upper lip but with this product it just goes away!  I don&#x27;t use it all the time now, only if I see that the skin has darkened a tad then I just apply for one night and I am back to norm again :).  Through trial &amp; error and research on the internet I finally have my melasma under control ( at least the visible aspect of it, now the hormonal is another aspect on its own)  I am so happy that this product has worked for me :)e visible aspect of it, now the hormonal is another aspect on its own)  I am so happy that this product has worked for me :)</li>
            <li> Best skin whitening serum I&#x27;ve used in really long time, I got results after only one use, I already reorder just to keep on hand, try it you won&#x27;t regret it ..,</li>
            <li> I purchased this based on positive reviews-  and have been using it for 5 days approx.  I&#x27;m amazed to say, it really works.  Not sure how exactly as I don&#x27;t think there is hydroquinone in it at all.  However, it has already lightened dark spots due to sun and acne scars.  And, it has helped existing spots heal.  Better than the px topical antibiotics I use, better than retin a,  better than benzyol peroxide cream in my current arsenal!  It does have a drying effect-  I have sensitive/combo skin.  I use a clarisonic to exfoliate daily.  Seems really important to keep out of the sun at this point…  I hope the effect lasts.  If so,  I&#x27;ll definitely purchase again and pass along the news!</li>
            <li> I did not notice any difference on my skin after 3 weeks so i stopped using it</li>
            <li> Good product for the money</li>
            <li> SPOT TEST this product before using it.  I was stupid to not do it, and now working through a couple of other products to help repair the damage.  This product literally burns the skin, it peels off, and unfortunately the skin underneath is charred!  I&#x27;m brown skinned too, and the resulting pigmentation is pretty strong.  I would not recommend this product.  Just go with something light and have lots of patience to allow your skin to repair on its own</li>
            <li> That upper lip is not looking so gray! I&#x27;m trying to get rid of that mustache look, which isn&#x27;t hair (usually!), but rather a pesky gray discoloration that comes with age. I think you have to be consistent to have it work. Stings a bit, but no damage incurred.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to address upper lip melasma which worsened dramatically after I was exposed to equatorial sun while on vacation. After only 2 weeks, I&#x27;ve had dramatic results such that I&#x27;ve just canceled my dermatology appointment. The product is strong and I use a very small amount on the hyperpigmented areas...just enough to feel a tingle (which subsides after a few minutes). The skin where I apply the product darkens slightly the next day, then peels off revealing lighter, new skin. If my new skin is pink, then I skip a day to allow more healing. Of course, I&#x27;ve been using tons of sunscreen and have been wearing a wide rimmed hat when I can. I rarely review products but am so happy this one has worked for me. The upper lip melasma is really terrible....making me so self conscious. I hope this review will help others.</li>
            <li> It was irritating and it made my hyperpigmentation worse. I have Asian skin and it is difficult to treat so it may work better for Caucasian skin.</li>
            <li> It took a whole bottle but if you don&#x27;t use sunscreen it&#x27;ll come back darker than before!</li>
            <li> I needed a little help with dark pigmentation after no sun protection for most of my outdoor life and it&#x27;s working!</li>
            <li> its been three weeks and my pigmentation spot on my cheeks  is getting lighter..</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t think I used long enough need to use consistently I think for a while.</li>
            <li> So far this product seems to be lightening the spots I got during a stress breakout. I&#x27;ve been using it at night and an spf 110 from Neutrogena during the day to be sure they stay gone.  This lightener is a good product, it seems to be working really well for me.</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference in my skin within the first week! Lots of blotches are getting lighter! I&#x27;m a fan!</li>
            <li> This gel is the best for a clear skin. I a month my spots are almost gone. Best gel.ever. Thank you</li>
            <li> Works great! It took a few weeks to see results but it faded my dark spots ..and erased some completely.</li>
            <li> I used to purchase this really expensive serum from a spa in California when I lived there that had similar ingredients.  When I moved to NY, I couldn&#x27;t find the brand.  I called the spa to see if I could order it, but they didn&#x27;t do online or phone orders.  You had to actually go into the spa to get it.  Not possible. Anyway, I had friends in California buy and ship it to me for a while until I found THIS.  It works just as well and is not as expensive.  Plus shipping is free.  So net/net, it&#x27;s a win for me.  I highly recommend it.  I&#x27;m not using it to whiten my skin but to create a healthy glow, which this serum does for me.  It causes some peeling, so it&#x27;s like a chemical peel in that sense but not as strong.  The peeling is gradual.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a month now and only notice a slight lightening, but I still can see the brown patches (melasma).&lt;br /&gt;Not very impressed with the product.</li>
            <li> After 35 years of buying nearly every available product out in the market, I must say that this one is by far the best! For a majority of my adult life, I struggled with acne and hated my skin. I finally gave in and did a 6 month treatment of Accutane which got rid of all my acne but left me with scars. I decided to use Obagi&#x27;s NuSkin system. It worked but made my skin so oily not to mention the nearly $600 price tag per month! Then I found Naked Face&#x27;s Whitening Serum.&lt;br /&gt;It has been a month of usage and I can&#x27;t even begin to describe what this serum has done for my acne scars and overall texture of my face. It&#x27;s amazing! It&#x27;s so light and the effects are almost immediate.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking to make those ugly marks disappear, this is the only one you&#x27;ll ever need. The price point is unbelievable and what it&#x27;ll do for your face will amaze you!</li>
            <li> MY FIRST EXPERIENCE WITH HYDROQUINONE AND I LOVE IT ONLY BEEN USING FOR ABOUT 4 DAYS AND MY FACE LOOKS BRIGHTER MY ISSUE ARE BLEMISHES AND IAM HOPING THAT BY THE TIME I FINISH THE BOTTLE I CAN SEE IMPROVEMENT, SO FAR IAM LOVING IT ALSO MY FACE IS REALLY SMOOTH WITH THIS. SHIPPPPING WAS REALLY FAST ALSO SO ANOTHER 5 STARS TO THAT :)</li>
            <li> This product really works if you have dark  spots on your face, you must purchase this as soon as possible - it&#x27;s a miracle &amp; excellent price, fast delivery I&#x27;m ordering more.</li>
            <li> I like the gel formula. I need more time to see the lightening effects. It&#x27;s got all the top ingrediants,so i&#x27;, giving 4 stars now  Austin</li>
            <li> So far so good... It&#x27;s been 10 days to be exact since I started using the product and I have already seen a big difference I my face... My dermatologist told me I have a skin condition know as Malasma which leaves dark areas of the skin... What drove me crazy is it affected my face and being a Mary Kay consultant selling beauty products... This wasn&#x27;t a good look as my face is my business. The Dermatoligist said this happen to a lot of people from the islands as the sun has a lot to do with it.. She prescribe 2 topical ointment.. Each cost $100 a piece and is not guaranteed to work (Her exact words) so here I was on Amazon searching for a cheaper alternative that is effective.. After reading the reviews for Procelain Skin Whitening Serum I decided to give it a try... Am so glad I did because it has cleared up my cheeks... I&#x27;ll order another to keep handy...</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I wanted to even my skin tone. This has yet to give me those results. I will finish the bottle (because it was expensive), but I will not buy another.</li>
            <li> My wife has melasma on her face due to sun exposure,  Right after my wife started applying this skin whitening solution, I am seeing the pigmentation slowly going away and seeing the skin getting normal color and getting smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely recommend this product for it does!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream almost two week for my discoloration on my skin (medium skin tone and 30 age) but honestly i haven&#x27;t seen any difference, i was so excited to get this after reading all the good reviews about this cream but i dont know wht is it? Not working for me at all soo far .. Disappointed !!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upated on 13 july 2013&lt;br /&gt; Its been more than a month i havent seen any difference at all by using this cream and also bit upset becuz just found out tht u can get same hydroquinone 2 % (strenghth cream from walmart at cosmetic section ) in way cheaper prize ..this cream is a ripoff ..SAVE UR MONEY .</li>
            <li> Hello,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product worked for the malasma I had on my lip but not so well for a brown spot I have on my face. I use it every night with no other products. I have been using it for about four months now. Will continue using it and hope that this brown spot goes away!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m black with darks marks from some moles I had to remove and because the idiot doctor didn&#x27;t a skin test on me first, so he decided to freeze the moles off instead of burning them. I was left with these very unattractive scars on my face. This product is a miracle not only are my scars gone; it also give my skin an even tone-even my facial guy commented on how even-toned my fave is. Love love!</li>
            <li> I purchased this Murad skin whitening serum after seeing it recommended by Good Housekeeping magazine. After years of baking myself in the sun, I have a number of sun spots on my arms and legs that I want to lighten.  After using this product for about 2 weeks, most of the spots already appear lighter! Keeping my fingers crossed that in another 2 weeks I&#x27;ll be even happier with the results!</li>
            <li> Been using it for 3 weeks took pictures just to remind myself in case there was a change. Well there wasn&#x27;t and I used it as directed religiously. Wished it did work now to to try and get my money back.</li>
            <li> I expected to be seeing results because it claimed that the brown spots I have on my face would start to diminish but they&#x27;re not as of the 5th week. I used it every night as recommended.&lt;br /&gt;Do I need a higher dosage since I got the lowest?</li>
            <li> I had super dark almost black melasma on my neck and as a very white skinned person it looked more like a hickey... so obviously as a mother it had to go. This did not work as good as the kojic soap bar did but I noticed the skin is much softer !</li>
            <li> The 2 stars is simply because the product arrived on time and was packaged well.  As for how this product works... it did nothing for me.  I never had any reaction to it nor did I see any improvement in my melasma.  Onto the next &amp;#34;miracle product&amp;#34;....</li>
            <li> Amazing!  Just ordered my second bottle!  I saw results within the first week of use.  Effective yet gentle.</li>
            <li> The product has darkened the spot on my face n I m very much disappointed.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin i WOULD NOT recommend using this product. I had a dark mark on my face due to acne pimple which i popped and left a scar but when i applied this product it burned immensely every time and actually made my skin worse.</li>
            <li> I have a skin condition called hyperpigmation, purchased the product that promises that it is a professional strength product that works to correct hyperpigmation but the verdit is still out, it hasn&#x27;t worked to this date</li>
            <li> I purchased this a week ago and began using it that night as directed. I could tell a difference within 4 days.&lt;br /&gt;Even family has remarked at how much better my face looks.  I was put on hormone replacement a couple of years ago and developed melasma around my mouth, my chin and down the side of both cheeks.  I was taken off the hormone replacement for a medical reason and was told the melasma would fade.  I have been struggling to lighten the areas for 2 yrs now without success and it hasn&#x27;t went away.  I purchased this on a \\&quot;why not\\&quot; I&#x27;ve tried everything else and thought I would try one more thing before spending the money on a dermatologist. Within 4 days the melasma around my mouth has faded to the point that only I notice it and the areas on my chin and cheeks has lighten enough that makeup conceals it.&lt;br /&gt;I hope that by the time I finish the month treatment as the directions instruct, that all areas will be lighten to almost non existent. I am happy that I purchased this.  I have experienced red and peeling skin, however it is worth it.</li>
            <li> Evens skin, but the jury is still out - tried it as an alternative to Murad, but overall prefer the quality of the Murad spot treatment gel.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  This product should have more hydroquinone in it, especially for people with darker than average knees and elbows. I&#x27;ve used this product as directed for over three weeks and have not noticed any changes.  I am not happy with this product and do not recommend its purchase.</li>
            <li> This was okay at controlling acne but barely did anything to lighten acne scars.  I will be trying something else.</li>
            <li> My mom bought this and so far it has worked great! It does a good job at removing what it&#x27;s supposed and she looks better than ever!</li>
            <li> This is my first Amazon review, I decided that this product was worth reviewing :) I would consider myself a product junkie because i&#x27;m always experimenting with different products to fade my hyperpigmentation. This product helped to reduce the appearance of some of my problem areas pretty quickly considering the other products I&#x27;ve tried. I&#x27;d say i began to see a difference after the first week. I also was surprised that the product has lasted as long as it has. Ive been using it for about a month and still have a bit left which is a bonus for me (since it was 30 dollars lol). I definitley plan on purchasing another bottle, it was worth the investment.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t say it&#x27;s a skin whitening product, it&#x27;s more of skin brightening and lightening. I have been using it for a few weeks now close to a month and my severe discoloration on my neck and chest is starting to fade away. My face is also brighter and more even looking, and my acne is gone. I just wished they had something bigger that I can use all over my body for larger areas.</li>
