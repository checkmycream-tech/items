            <li>Got many many compliments</li>
            <li>I love that they are smooth with glitter</li>
            <li>Really liked it but not crazy about all of the colors.</li>
            <li>It dries very fast and nicely.  </li>
            <li>Everything oversee work just fine</li>
            <li>and I have about 3 months free of nail polish complaints (the lack of nail polish and colors).</li>

            <li>Don&#x27;t really care too much for glitter</li>
            <li>I usually don&#x27;t like to buy variety packs because I might only like one or two colors, but considering I got 6 beautiful colors and each are all wearable, I thought this was truly a bargain.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I love the colors and how long they last on.  </li>
            <li>Very pigmented, only one layer is enough, and dry pretty quickly.</li>

            <li>I love the fact that it takes only a few minutes after applying this nail polish to continue with your daily routine.  </li>
            <li>All the colors were extremely pigmented with high gloss and tons of glitter and sparkly</li>
            <li>Chips quickly even with a base and top coat.</li>

            <li> Well, don&#x27;t forget the base coat :)</li>
            <li> but they didn&#x27;t have the typical glitter nail polish texture.</li>
            <li> #34;These polishes could be worn over a solid base color but are pigmented enough after two coats to be opaque on their own.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Bough for girlfriend, she says:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;I was very happy with the Brilliant Nail Gloss Holiday gift set. All the colors were extremely pigmented with high gloss and tons of glitter and sparkly but they didn&#x27;t have the typical glitter nail polish texture. With or without a top coat the were smooth and easier to remove than a normal glitter nail polish. All of the colors were true to what they appeared to be in the bottle and the staying power was more then 5 days with no chips with just a generic top coat. 5/5. &amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, &amp;#34;These polishes could be worn over a solid base color but are pigmented enough after two coats to be opaque on their own.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whatever that means.</li>
            <li> I love them. Very pigmented, only one layer is enough, and dry pretty quickly. What I really like is that they give your nails that glittery look WITHOUT the struggle to remove actual glittered polish.</li>
            <li> I was really surprised when this came in and I saw all the colors - I could see myself wearing each one of them! They are shimmers but the colors are very rich, and the polish is pretty long-lasting.  I usually don&#x27;t like to buy variety packs because I might only like one or two colors, but considering I got 6 beautiful colors and each are all wearable, I thought this was truly a bargain.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Great colors and I love that they are smooth with glitter, I don&#x27;t see that very often. I don&#x27;t like the square shape of the bottles while painting but it&#x27;s not a deal breaker.</li>
            <li> I love it.  I&#x27;ve tried the purple and 1 coat goes on see thru (which I love) a 2nd coat made it opaque.</li>
            <li> Bought for daughter. She is happy with them.</li>
            <li> Chips quickly even with a base and top coat.</li>
            <li> Everything oversee work just fine</li>
            <li> All in One!  Well, almost.  I love the fact that it takes only a few minutes after applying this nail polish to continue with your daily routine.  It dries very fast and nicely.  I love the colors and how long they last on.  I definitely recommend the quality and... what&#x27;s not to like when you get it for a great price?!  Why not All in One?  Well, don&#x27;t forget the base coat :)</li>
            <li> Really liked it but not crazy about all of the colors.</li>
            <li> Great gift for a great price!</li>
            <li> Got this during the Amazon Prime  anniversary (something like that) for my wife. She was excited and highly thankful- good gift idea on my part. Now she has more nail polish and I have about 3 months free of nail polish complaints (the lack of nail polish and colors).</li>
            <li> lovely colors and stays for long. 2 pieces were damaged but colors are nice.</li>
            <li> beautiful colors!! Had a blast this summer. Got many many compliments</li>
            <li> Like cover girl the best</li>
            <li> Totally recommend! Check out my video review to see the details of these polishes including swatches, bottle shots, and macros! http://youtu.be/oBDHThxybX0</li>
            <li> colors on the box are EXACTLY what you get. My 12 year old loves it. Wazzup with these reviews of negativity, chill out, its Missmiss.</li>
            <li> bought for my daughter and she loved the colors</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really care too much for glitter but these are great.  Colors are beautiful.</li>
            <li> Nice box - will be perfect Christmas present for my niece.</li>
            <li> It would be nice if you could see the colors.  The picture I get looks like a piece of sandpaper with no nail polish around.  Is this a glitch?</li>
