            <li> I think maybe because this bottle is clear &amp; the other one isnt.</li>
            <li> In fact, I ended up with a bunch of new, red little zits all over my face.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> After running out &amp; trying to use other brands, I realized this is a definite essential to always have.  </li>
            <li> It lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I use it with my clasonic brush and other products by this same company.</li>
            <li> and this product does not overly dry my skin out.  </li>
            <li> Can dry out the eye area and bleach clothes</li>
            <li> and it takes off all eye make up without stinging the eyes or leaving the skin dry.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin.</li>
            <li> It removes all makeup, even mascara and does not make my face dry.</li>
            <li> this facial wash is nothing extra ordinary.</li>
            <li> The only time I&#x27;ve had trouble with it was over a really dry winter when it seemed like everything was too drying.</li>
            <li> but so do the other brands.</li>
            <li> I have used other face washes that strip my skin</li>
            <li> and my skill is not irritate like used to be with other cleansers that I used to remove makeup.</li>
            <li> You only need to Use a small bit.</li>
            <li> A little goes a very long way!</li>
            <li> It seems watered down.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT SEEMS TO HAVE CALMED DOWN MY CONDITION OF SUBACEOUS HYPERPLASIA</li>
            <li> I have allergic reactions to just about everything that you use on the face, but PCA products are one of the few that I don&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> Afterward, my face felt dried out.  </li>
            <li> Cleans without being harsh and drying</li>
            <li> Wasted my money</li>
            <li> I dont usually review</li>
            <li> I usually buy this product at a salon</li>
            <li> Also, I received my order in less then 3 days!!</li>
            <li> and it is hard to find one that fits in this category.</li>
            <li> There are a lot of pca products which can make purchasing confusing.</li>
            <li> A very small amount is required to thoroughly cleanse ones face.</li>
            <li> Use a very small amount for a lot of lather.</li>
            <li> Sorry.</li>
            <li> Wish it weren&#x27;t so darn expensive..</li>
            <li> They are expensive!  </li>
            <li> Hated this product doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> worst thing about this is that you can&#x27;t return it.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I figured i will use the product for a couple of months and give my review...this facial wash is nothing extra ordinary. I used it twice a day, 2-3 times a week with my clarisonic facial brush. I guess my quest for a more satisfying facial wash continues...</li>
            <li> I purchased this product on a recommendation from my esthetician.  I have dry to normal skin and this product does not overly dry my skin out.  You don&#x27;t need a lot of the product to wash your face which is a bonus.  I use about a quarter size amount so this bottle will last me quite some time.</li>
            <li> I have allergic reactions to just about everything that you use on the face, but PCA products are one of the few that I don&#x27;t.  Skin cleanser feels less drying than many.  Love that there was no shipping charge.</li>
            <li> Love this face wash has really helped my skin.</li>
            <li> This face wash cleared up my sensitive skin!!</li>
            <li> I love PCA. I have been using it for years.  I have acre prone skin, and keeps my face clean and clear.</li>
            <li> I loved the oily skin version but this one for some reason majorly dries my skin.</li>
            <li> This product doesnt clean my skin, but the trial sized one does(?) I think maybe because this bottle is clear &amp; the other one isnt. Anyway, will not purchase this specific product again.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  Great for combo to oily skin!</li>
            <li> this is a very economical product to use because just a dab will clean the face without making your skin feel stripped.&lt;br /&gt;I bought the trial acne kit and have been raving about it.</li>
            <li> Great light face wash that lathers well and rinses easily.  Leaves skin feeling very clean!  Highly recommended at the Dermatologist office.</li>
            <li> My first salon experience included a facial process in which this product was used. I was nervous since I have allergy issues and my skin is highly sensitive, meaning \\&quot;embarrassing rash\\&quot; from most products I&#x27;ve tried. After she used it, my skin was soft and felt so refreshed, plus there was no reaction. I immediately purchased a bottle and it lasted forever, not a lot is needed at a time. This product doesn&#x27;t really have an odor, which is nice, and it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out, instead it makes it feel softer and smoother.</li>
            <li> I dont usually review but I wanted to say that this face wash and the lotion and toner that are the same company are great.  They are expensive!  But you can use them wisely amd they have made a huge difference in my skin - acne, lines, aging, etc.  They&#x27;re just great products!</li>
            <li> Great face wash this product for those with combination skin.  I would recommend it to others.  I will purchase this item again.</li>
            <li> I love this facial wash and have used it for a few years now.</li>
            <li> This is a good product it&#x27;s gentle and very refreshing and makes your skin feel really good.&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> I love this face wash about all others I have used.  It has a perfect ph balance for my skin and it has reduced some brown spots to nothing.  It leaves your skin feeling clean and not tight or dried out.</li>
            <li> I think this product line is excellent.  It works very well on all skin type. My daughter has acne and it&#x27;s cleared her up.</li>
            <li> It provides a nice and clean feeling. A very small amount is required to thoroughly cleanse ones face. It removes make up and very gentle.</li>
            <li> Sensitive enough for my skin, but nothing more than what I could probably but at Walmart. Sorry.</li>
            <li> Pca is the only product my teenager can use that keeps acne under control. We have tried epiduo and  proactive with no luck. Can dry out the eye area and bleach clothes but so do the other brands. The wash combined with the retinol seems all you need. There are a lot of pca products which can make purchasing confusing.</li>
            <li> I think it is better then any other skin care which I have used many in my 57 years of skin care</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 15 years on my extremely sensitive skin with not a single problem.</li>
            <li> I would say in general this is a great cleanser. The only time I&#x27;ve had trouble with it was over a really dry winter when it seemed like everything was too drying. But overall, I&#x27;ve had great success with it.</li>
            <li> Great product I have used it for years and will continue to order it.&lt;br /&gt;I will also refer my friends to this product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this product at all - my face does not feel clean after I use it.  I would not purchase this again.</li>
            <li> Have used it for years on my sensitive skin without a single incident. Great for people with dermatological issues. Very gentle and effective.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best products for cleansing of face, doesn&#x27;t dry your skiing and it cleans all impurities.  I use it twice a day.</li>
            <li> I tried pca line based on spa recommendation, in general, I didn&#x27;t like the 3 products (2 cream, 1 cleansing) I tried. I&#x27;ve normal skin w/ sensitive cheeks and oily t-zone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one is not foamy. It doesn&#x27;t feel like doing much of cleaning. Afterward, my face felt dried out.  I didn&#x27;t finish using this product. Switched back to Shiseido&#x27;s Benefiance creamy cleansing foam that I normally used.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great face wash for not too much money and it takes off all eye make up without stinging the eyes or leaving the skin dry. I have used it for over two years and I have no reason to switch to anything else.</li>
            <li> I liked this product and would recommend it. It is a light wash that leaves your skin feeling clean. The price is fair also.</li>
            <li> Always love this facial wash.. Wish it weren&#x27;t so darn expensive..</li>
            <li> This is a great cleanser to use alone on a non-make-up face, or as an extra cleanser after oil cleanser.  I saw this on Youtube, and had to try it.</li>
            <li> Love it have used it for years</li>
            <li> My face feels so clean after using this. Just a dime size amount makes a great lather for my face.</li>
            <li> Awesome product, thank you for such fast shipping.</li>
            <li> It feels good on my skin as I&#x27;m washing it but noticed it left my skin a little dry. I guess if I had oily skin I would purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I have used many high-dollar skin products, and PCA Skin products are by far the best.  The facial  wash promotes clean, healthy skin.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for 15 years, I love it and will keep using it.</li>
            <li> I have loved this face wash since the day I was introduced. Its a great! Washes off all my makeup, rinses great and leaves my skin feeling fresh and clean. It doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin. I will keep using this product. Also, I received my order in less then 3 days!!</li>
            <li> Have loved this product for over 15 years.....did not know I could get it so easily on Amazon....Please keep it available....</li>
            <li> Love this product. I consistently have clear balanced skin with this item. When I stray and try something else I break out.</li>
            <li> I like this cleanser.  It removes all makeup, even mascara and does not make my face dry. I will repurchase.</li>
            <li> i have acne prone skin, and my cleanser is the BPO from pca skin, but i did buy this one to use it when i get facials and chemical peels because is mild o my skin, it does what it says, take off the make up and oil from the skin, leaven it clean and ready for the toner.....</li>
            <li> I am extremely happy with this product.  I have extremely sensitive skin with many products causing breakouts.  This product really cleans your face and leaves it very soft and breakout free.  I am looking forward to more PCA products.  Like many people I can&#x27;t afford $100.00 products I read about.  This is the ticket!!  very fast delivery!!</li>
            <li> I have used this for a month and there is no difference in my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I feel nothing when I use it.  It seems watered down.</li>
            <li> Great face wash with a very pleasant feel and smell. I first discovered this at a luxury spa. Rinses easily.</li>
            <li> This face wash is unscented and perfect for normal/combination/sensitive skin. I have used other face washes that strip my skin and it is hard to find one that fits in this category. Highly recommend this product to anyone. The product comes in a pretty big bottle too. A little goes a very long way!</li>
            <li> I use this every am and night.  Makes my face feel clean and smooth.  Non oily. Cleans without being harsh and drying</li>
            <li> Use a very small amount for a lot of lather. This cleanser foams up, cleans really well, and rinses off easily. It feels really gentle on the skin. Love the PCA line of products.</li>
            <li> My favorite cleanser. Clears my skin up and leaves it soft.</li>
            <li> I like so much since it takes all makeup really well and my skill is not irritate like used to be with other cleansers that I used to remove makeup. I will recommend to any one that wants to feel the skin clean after a long day of work</li>
            <li> I have used this wash for almost 15 years. It really keeps my skin clear and clear.</li>
            <li> This facial wash made my face look 5 years older and sooo dry after a week of using it.&lt;br /&gt;I am still trying to get my face back to the starting point.&lt;br /&gt;And oh yeah, this doesn&#x27;t help with acne at all. In fact, I ended up with a bunch of new, red little zits all over my face.&lt;br /&gt;The worst thing about this is that you can&#x27;t return it. So I&#x27;ve waisted about $80.00 on PCA products to make my skin look so much worse.&lt;br /&gt;I am very dissapointed.</li>
            <li> My go to skin cleanser.  You only need to Use a small bit. I Have not  found anything better, most leave my skin tight or feeling like there is a film left.</li>
            <li> Love this product, cleans my face good. Doesn&#x27;t give me any breakouts, leaves my face refreshed! I use the toner, and the clear soap from PCA too. Phase 42. Looks like the toner but is soap.</li>
            <li> Love the way it cleans your face with no breakouts.  This is for my daughter who is 13.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Great product! Fast deliver!</li>
            <li> It makes my face feel great.  I use it with my clasonic brush and other products by this same company.</li>
            <li> My skin really improved. It lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> The product arrived very quickly but it has a strange odor. I usually buy this product at a salon but I recently moved to a new location and I couldn&#x27;t find a PCA distributor.  It was sealed but still didn&#x27;t smell very good.</li>
            <li> I love PCA products &amp; have used this wash before.  After running out &amp; trying to use other brands, I realized this is a definite essential to always have.  Arrived on time &amp; I will definitely order again!!</li>
            <li> shipped fast! and I love the product!</li>
            <li> Love this face wash...actually I like all the PCA products I&#x27;ve used!!  Great for sensitive skin too!</li>
            <li> Great product reasonable price</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted. Been using it for years and my local source stopped carrying it so Amazon saved the day!</li>
            <li> Excellent and received quickly</li>
            <li> My doctor recommended this for my oily/combination skin and occasional breakouts. I leave it on for 5 minutes and then rinse. I have used every product from Murad to Proactive to Perricone. Nothing makes my skin feel better - and that was from day one. I highly recommend and it&#x27;s so inexpensive that there&#x27;s no reason not to...</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT SEEMS TO HAVE CALMED DOWN MY CONDITION OF SUBACEOUS HYPERPLASIA WHEN NOTHING ELSE DID.</li>
            <li> I love PCA products and this is the first time trying the facial wash. It smells good and it washes my face without feeloing dry afterwards.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cleanser for years and I am very happy with results.</li>
            <li> Product came quickly and was exactly what I wanted.  Have been using this product for years and love it.</li>
