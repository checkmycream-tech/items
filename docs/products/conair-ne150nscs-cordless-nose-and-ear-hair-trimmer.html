    <ol>
            <li>Great Price too!</li>
            <li>LOL!</li>
            <li>We should be able to rate products as a 0!!!!</li>
            <li>This is a great invention...</li>
            <li>works great</li>
            <li>Great price and does the job.</li>
            <li>But this works the best of all and is the most versatile.</li>
            <li>works fine, it is not the best in the market but for this price...</li>
            <li>For close-ness, the micro-trim was superior, if they&#x27;re still around</li>
            <li>Ladies, if ever you&#x27;ve been distracted by unsightly nasal hairs protruding from a loved one&#x27;s nose, this is the product to buy, and your problems will be solved.&lt;br /&gt;Added uses...  </li>
            <li>All in all, a good product for taking care of this issue.</li>
            <li>Also, if still available, the Sharper Image made a trimmer at $59 that was very good.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>and i love it!</li>
            <li>I find this amazing.</li>
            <li>This one does the trick nicely.  </li>
            <li>item works fantastic, just as it says it does, i was reading reviews about it and some were not so good, but i went ahead and got it</li>
            <li>It does the job just OK.</li>
            <li>Interesting device with two drawbacks which are sensory driven.  </li>
            <li>Again, usable but could be better.</li>
            <li>Is there a better product out there on these two issues?</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t fully investigated the hygene angle of this additional use, so perhaps you&#x27;d better order two, to be on the safe side.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure I&#x27;d be able to do that with the rotary type.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied with this device.</li>
            <li>For the price, it&#x27;s pretty darn good.</li>
            <li>Nose hair cuts off easily as does ear hair.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>but you&#x27;ll quickly notice it&#x27;s just noise from this item!</li>
            <li>I received this for free and tried it out.</li>
            <li>Using in the nose, it smells of light machine oil (or 3 in 1 oil) even after a year of use.  </li>
            <li>This one is cheap, but I would go with the panasonic.</li>
            <li>As I get older I find I need a product like this more and more.  </li>
            <li>It is easy, quick, and doesn&#x27;t pull or pinch like another product I used.  </li>
            <li>Go spend a ton more or have it done professionally for alot more, but don&#x27;t complain when you&#x27;re not paying alot.  </li>
            <li>Any way, it trims nose hair (and ear hair) quickly and painlessly.  </li>
            <li>Nose and ear hair--a subject we have to deal with, win, lose or draw.    </li>
            <li>Note that it is pretty good for trimming hair above your ears between haircuts.</li>
            <li>It may be cheap, but it really doesn&#x27;t do the job.  </li>
            <li>The first one was taken to college with our son.</li>
            <li>This one really cuts the hair, is a powerful tool and you can take it everywhere with you.</li>
            <li>First time buying a product like this.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick, light, does its job and just about jumps back into the drawer and smiles at you.    </li>
            <li>Moral of this story: this Conair thing ain&#x27;t even worth the cheap price.</li>
            <li>On the positive: does not tug like the circular-type machines, which can also cause a histamine release (sneezing).    </li>
            <li>While it will certainly &amp;quot;get the job done,&amp;quot;  I found this model less effective than the (I believe)</li>
            <li>now we do we hear him mumble..and fuss about how he is certain he will cut off his ear someday.....</li>
            <li>The size of th contraption is really too large, and you can&#x27;t take it traveling if you want to save space.  </li>
            <li>The Conair Trimmer works very well.  </li>
            <li>The blades move fast and sounds like it&#x27;s doing something</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this model in black for years, and I&#x27;m glad to see it&#x27;s still being produced; I plan to buy a silver model soon.</li>
            <li>I wanted a new one, considered others, but went with what works.</li>
            <li>because I am a wreck in the mornings, and often forget to use my \\&quot;old reliable\\&quot; Panasonic one at home after shaving!...</li>
            <li>It is sharp and cuts cleanly.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought seven or eight trimmers, including a couple that were in the $30 range and almost all looked better and more serious than this little dude.    </li>
            <li>I purchased his trimmer as my husband&#x27;s old trimmer quit working.</li>
            <li>It is loud, and doesn&#x27;t cut close.</li>
            <li>Useable but loud.  </li>
            <li>Hmmm, a nose hair trimmer with an odor, and an ear hair trimmer that&#x27;s too loud.  </li>
            <li>panasonic unit I had which has a circular blade that spins rather than this straight blade that goes back and forth.  </li>
            <li>As for actual cutting, it is pretty good but areas need to be repeated before being completely removed.</li>
            <li>For under ten bucks, it represents decent value.  </li>
            <li>I have to buy a new Conair because I lost mine, which I bought back in 1999.</li>
            <li>On the negative side: strong burning odor emanating from the device.    </li>
            <li>If you have large dark hair follicles, such as myself, it may not look like trimmed hair.</li>
            <li>Who wants little stubbies in their nose?</li>

            <li> Getting at your ear hair and nose hair with a flat blade is an excercise in frustration.    </li>
            <li> I chose the Conair with the straight-line cutter because I can manually control just how short or long I want those nose hairs.  </li>
            <li> I prefer this flat blade to the other models of various brands using a rotary blade.  </li>
            <li> I got sick of looking at my own nose hair</li>
            <li> The other models only trim the hair.</li>
            <li> so I can only imagine how other people felt.  </li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s a little noisy and it gives off a bit of an ozone smell, but the batteries last forever and it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> But the trimmers that are able to that pull the hairs out instead of cutting (ouch!).  </li>
            <li> I bought this item because some friends have different items for the same purpose as this one but all of them have poor performance.</li>
            <li> I thought this had a round rotor due to the cap</li>
            <li> My only mildly negative comment would be that I wish it would cut a little shorter.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t want to lose my hearing just to trim a little ear hair.  </li>
            <li> This dandy little trimmer works a treat for tidying up your eyebrows too.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> While I have never experienced any discomfort from using it, nevertheless it does not trim close.</li>
            <li> Tired of plucking your eyebrows?  </li>
            <li> Sorry, no windows.</li>
            <li> The blade isn&#x27;t the issue -- it&#x27;s the ability to actually \\&quot;get at\\&quot; those nasty hairs and cut them off.   </li>
            <li> make it uncomfortable for nose use.  </li>
            <li> Worthless.</li>
            <li> It is worthless!</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve bought seven or eight trimmers, including a couple that were in the $30 range and almost all looked better and more serious than this little dude.    But this works the best of all and is the most versatile. It&#x27;s quick, light, does its job and just about jumps back into the drawer and smiles at you.    And the cheapo slider on/off switch? Doesn&#x27;t turn itself on inside a toilet kit the way several others have. And yeah, it does eyebrows, sideburns, ears, noses. Sorry, no windows.</li>
            <li> After watching my Dad struggle with his scissors to clip, what he affectionately calls his &#x27;tuffs of ear hair&#x27;. I bought him this electric clippers...now we do we hear him mumble..and fuss about how he is certain he will cut off his ear someday.....This is a great invention...it moves at lightenind speed and clips those hairs neaty...... Great Price too!</li>
            <li> I purchased his trimmer as my husband&#x27;s old trimmer quit working. I haven&#x27;t heard any complaints.</li>
            <li> My family loves this product.  This is our second purchase of it.  The first one was taken to college with our son.</li>
            <li> I bought this Conair unit for the car (!)-(yup!) because I am a wreck in the mornings, and often forget to use my \\&quot;old reliable\\&quot; Panasonic one at home after shaving!...Moral of this story: this Conair thing ain&#x27;t even worth the cheap price. It is loud, and doesn&#x27;t cut close. Like giving your ear hairs a crew cut.</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase of this same model. I droped my last one, over, and over again. It never, ever, broke. I owned it for over five years. I wanted a new one, considered others, but went with what works. The other models only trim the hair. This one will get all of it. Who wants little stubbies in their nose? If you have large dark hair follicles, such as myself, it may not look like trimmed hair. LOL!</li>
            <li> I have to buy a new Conair because I lost mine, which I bought back in 1999. Seven years later, the batteries were still running. I find this amazing. Nose hair cuts off easily as does ear hair. This is a must-have. I&#x27;m puzzled by complaints that this doesn&#x27;t cut nose hair. The hair would have to have the consistency of wire to impede the Conair from doing its job.</li>
            <li> I bought this item because some friends have different items for the same purpose as this one but all of them have poor performance. This one really cuts the hair, is a powerful tool and you can take it everywhere with you.</li>
            <li> I received this for free and tried it out. It does the job just OK. Noisy.</li>
            <li> Nose and ear hair--a subject we have to deal with, win, lose or draw.    This one from Conair, does take effort.  While I have never experienced any discomfort from using it, nevertheless it does not trim close. I guess that&#x27;s to avoid injury lawsuits.    On the positive: does not tug like the circular-type machines, which can also cause a histamine release (sneezing).    On the negative side: strong burning odor emanating from the device.    For under ten bucks, it represents decent value.  For close-ness, the micro-trim was superior, if they&#x27;re still around and you can deal with all the up-sell attempts by their tele-marketers.    Also, if still available, the Sharper Image made a trimmer at $59 that was very good.  And, at that price, it should be.</li>
            <li> The Conair Trimmer works very well.  It is sharp and cuts cleanly.  No nicks on the face.</li>
            <li> Interesting device with two drawbacks which are sensory driven.  One is that when you use it in your ear it is quite noisy.  I wouldn&#x27;t want to lose my hearing just to trim a little ear hair.  Useable but loud.  Using in the nose, it smells of light machine oil (or 3 in 1 oil) even after a year of use.  Again, usable but could be better. As for actual cutting, it is pretty good but areas need to be repeated before being completely removed. Hmmm, a nose hair trimmer with an odor, and an ear hair trimmer that&#x27;s too loud.  Is there a better product out there on these two issues?</li>
            <li> Ladies, if ever you&#x27;ve been distracted by unsightly nasal hairs protruding from a loved one&#x27;s nose, this is the product to buy, and your problems will be solved.&lt;br /&gt;Added uses...  Tired of plucking your eyebrows?  This dandy little trimmer works a treat for tidying up your eyebrows too.&lt;br /&gt;But wait!  I haven&#x27;t fully investigated the hygene angle of this additional use, so perhaps you&#x27;d better order two, to be on the safe side.</li>
            <li> I can see people complaining about this trimmer if they were paying a big price, but c&#x27;mon!  It does a decent job and the noise isn&#x27;t any louder than your average vibrator! (joke)  Go spend a ton more or have it done professionally for alot more, but don&#x27;t complain when you&#x27;re not paying alot.  You get what you pay for....</li>
            <li> Getting at your ear hair and nose hair with a flat blade is an excercise in frustration.    I thought this had a round rotor due to the cap but it didnt.</li>
            <li> I chose the Conair with the straight-line cutter because I can manually control just how short or long I want those nose hairs.  I wasn&#x27;t sure I&#x27;d be able to do that with the rotary type. I like this design.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied with this device. It cuts the hairs you want cut, and never pinches. Yes, it&#x27;s a little noisy and it gives off a bit of an ozone smell, but the batteries last forever and it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. For the price, it&#x27;s pretty darn good.</li>

            <li> works fine, it is not the best in the market but for this price... I recomend it</li>
            <li> It may be cheap, but it really doesn&#x27;t do the job.  It&#x27;s vibrations make it uncomfortable for nose use.  The size of th contraption is really too large, and you can&#x27;t take it traveling if you want to save space.  Note that it is pretty good for trimming hair above your ears between haircuts.</li>
            <li> item works fantastic, just as it says it does, i was reading reviews about it and some were not so good, but i went ahead and got it and i love it! works great</li>
            <li> While it will certainly &amp;quot;get the job done,&amp;quot;  I found this model less effective than the (I believe) panasonic unit I had which has a circular blade that spins rather than this straight blade that goes back and forth.  This one is cheap, but I would go with the panasonic.</li>
            <li> As I get older I find I need a product like this more and more.  It is easy, quick, and doesn&#x27;t pull or pinch like another product I used.  All in all, a good product for taking care of this issue.</li>

But the trimmers that are able to that pull the hairs out instead of cutting (ouch!).  Besides, I doubt anybody will be looking up your nose with a magnifying glass.</li>
            <li> Great price and does the job. I am very pleased. Shipment arrived ahead of schedule.</li>
            <li> We should be able to rate products as a 0!!!! This would suffice for this product. It is worthless! Does cut anything!! Can&#x27;t get anything. Worthless. The blades move fast and sounds like it&#x27;s doing something but you&#x27;ll quickly notice it&#x27;s just noise from this item!</li>
