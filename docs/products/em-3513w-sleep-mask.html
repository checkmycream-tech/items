            <li>For me this sleep mask is okay, at best.</li>
            <li>I liked these but forgot them on the plane!</li>
            <li>The nose piece conforms perfectly and leaves no gaps for light to go through.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fairly comfy, and it doesn&#x27;t leave lines on my face, sot</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s good.</li>

            <li>Love this mask!</li>
            <li>I LOVE this mask!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;d make a great gift too, and comes in a very pretty box!</li>
            <li>And of course it blocks light just great.</li>
            <li>They are designed with a kind of cup configuration covering your eyes so there is no pressure on the eyes at all.</li>
            <li>The adjustable strap is a nice touch, too.</li>
            <li>So it kind of just kept pushing them in or moving the ear plugs also.</li>
            <li>did like how around the eyes, that there is room for your eyes to blink and not rub on any kind of material.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discounted rate for an honest review.</li>
            <li>The clasp adjustment on the strap is nice, doesn&#x27;t get stuck in my hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Definite win - thanks for a great product üëçüèº</li>
            <li>The no snag closure is nice too along with the way the mask has space</li>
            <li>The mask fits very nicely and does not let in any light.  </li>
            <li>Love, love this sleep mask!</li>
            <li>He sleeps with a mask, but liked this one so much better.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a variety of sleep mask over the years, this one is by far the best!  </li>
            <li>Super cute design &amp; amazing product!</li>
            <li>She thinks this one is beautiful and fits very well.</li>
            <li>About a week into sleeping with this mask, very comfortable.</li>

            <li>and it&#x27;s very comfortable.</li>
            <li>The contoured face is very comfortable,</li>
            <li>All in all, a very comfortable mask for me.</li>

            <li>Very comfortable.</li>
            <li>Good product &amp; quick delivery</li>
            <li>I am 100% satisfied with this mask set.</li>
            <li>I love this mask.</li>
            <li>Though it was amazing on how it kept the light out, I really LOVE this one without the velcro.</li>
            <li>Best part, when you open and close your eyes, your eyes never touch the mask.  </li>
            <li>Also when I&#x27;m on my next plane trip, I can wear this without it smudging off my make-up, and get a great sleep!  </li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m a martyr, what can I say? :-) )  </li>
            <li>Blocks out all light, despite my generously-sized nose!  </li>
            <li>I love how this fits me &amp; molds on my face.</li>
            <li>This is the most comfortable sleep mask I&#x27;ve ever owned!</li>
            <li>Someone needs to build a better mousetrap sleep mask.</li>
            <li>This mask doesn&#x27;t crush your eyeballs like most.</li>
            <li>The earplugs are excellent - I would definitely purchase them again.</li>
            <li>This mask is great because it is concave and very lightweight.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since I&#x27;ve gotten this mask I&#x27;ve found myself sleeping better and feeling more rested when I wake.</li>
            <li>this sleep mask is WAY more comfortable than the others!  </li>
            <li>Wearing the mask definately helps me have a better and deeper sleep.  </li>
            <li>think that it&#x27;s not a horrible product, but it&#x27;s just not for</li>
            <li>This mask does completely block all light when positioned perfectly.</li>
            <li>I have not been able to keep this on throughout the night.</li>
            <li>I purchased a homemade one on Etsy that is still my favorite (</li>
            <li>I love this sleep mask.</li>
            <li>The earplugs we comfortable and the carrying case is nice too.</li>
            <li>( I never am able to sleep on planes).</li>
            <li>Cute pattern and I like the adjustable strap.</li>
            <li>Luv how it fits over your nose to keep even more light out!</li>
            <li>This one seems better than others I have tried recently, mostly since it doesn&#x27;t have velcro.</li>
            <li>I am beyond pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li>And I love that it doesn&#x27;t have a hook and loop fastener.  </li>
            <li>I love that the fit is adjustable and because I am Asian with a small/flat nose, this mask works perfectly.  </li>
            <li>Good and pretty mask, indispensible for day sleepers.</li>
            <li>The band is adjustable, But the snugger the fit, the greater the ear irritation and pressure on my head.</li>
            <li>Love this- comfortable and soothing-</li>
            <li>Sleeping while it&#x27;s light out is more than a challenge.</li>
            <li>thing that I really love about this mask is that it&#x27;s contoured to fit around the bridge of your nose.</li>
            <li>The eye mask is comfortable and I have been able to sleep wearing the mask.</li>
            <li>so I would guess that it would fit more adults without a problem.</li>
            <li>With the mask and earplugs, I shut my office door and am able to get a fantastic power nap.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the freedom of being able to move my eyelids.</li>
            <li>Very quality sewn and made with good materials.</li>
            <li>Very quality sewn and made with good materials.</li>
            <li>Totally cool product!</li>
            <li>I love the mask it doesnt tangle in my hair and is light on your face but keeps out the light.  </li>
            <li>It arrived very quickly as well</li>
            <li>These have an easy to adjust buckle closure; you do not want a velcro sleep mask, it catches on your hair and is a pain to adjust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I find myself waking up easily</li>
            <li>The adjustable strap is easy to use and does not cause any snags in your hair or any discomfort.</li>
            <li>Being able to open my eyes with the mask on is a welcome change.</li>
            <li>You would think with the contour for your nose that it would fit snuggly and block out most of the light.</li>
            <li>It‚Äôs also a great way to get a natural drug free sleep</li>
            <li>Fit is super comfy, and works really well at keeping all light out!!!  </li>
            <li>This is hands down the best sleep mask I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>Buckle makes it easy to fit</li>
            <li>First off, there is no such thing as a perfect sleep mask.</li>
            <li>I was glad that it did provide full blockage from light.  </li>
            <li>all the light is blocked, and easy to adjust and is so comfy</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super light weight and smooth, the inside is molded leaving plenty of room for you to blink and it won&#x27;t squish and rub on your eye lashes and it stays very securely on your head.</li>
            <li>Most sleeping masks don&#x27;t adequate fit around your nose</li>
            <li>The cushioned edges are very comfortable and the strap is easily adjusted to fit just right.</li>
            <li>It blocks 99% of the light.</li>
            <li>The elastic band is comfortable and generously adjustable.</li>
            <li>The way they feel(or don&#x27;t, because you feel nothing, not even the elastic band) on the eyes is extremely comfortable.</li>
            <li>Comfortable strap.</li>
            <li>100% blocks out the light and is comfortable on the face.  </li>
            <li>but then I saw this one and am so happy with it that I might even buy a red one for another variety.  </li>
            <li>It keeps light out</li>
            <li>/&gt;Comfortable, close fit, with a buckle adjustable strap.</li>
            <li>I have light coming in to my bedroom transom windows.  </li>
            <li>It fit well and never caught in my hair or pulled in any way.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d suggest not to just rely on a sleep mask alone at home; do whatever you can do in your bedroom to reduce or eliminate any light seeping in.</li>
            <li>Allows for free eye movement and blinking throughout  the night;</li>
            <li>Although the nose bridge somewhat helps to block light, it sometimes doesn&#x27;t if the mask shifts up.&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t work as well if you side sleep.</li>
            <li>and it keeps all light out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s comfortable and I like the design.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s stays comfortably in place during sleeps and blocks out all light.</li>
            <li>When I remove the mask, I&#x27;m always surprised at how bright it is.</li>
            <li>Having a buckle closure instead of velcro is fantastic because 1) it doesn&#x27;t get stuck in my hair and 2)</li>
            <li>(Plus you get free earplugs too</li>
            <li>The mask blocks out all the light.</li>
            <li>It shields the wind and the light when he reads before bed.  </li>
            <li>The molded cups are fantastic and do not prevent me from opening my eyes.  </li>
            <li>And because of that alittle light shines through around the nose.</li>
            <li>The headband is comfortable for side sleeping which can be a problem with bands with bulkier buckles.</li>
            <li>Blocks light like it is supposed to, does not crush eyelashes.</li>
            <li>Contours to the face well to not let any light in around the nose area.</li>
            <li>This mask keeps the light out and is comfortable.</li>
            <li>It blocks virtually all light.  </li>
            <li>It stays in place, comfortably.  </li>
            <li>The mask is ok, not that comfortable to worth this price.</li>
            <li>With that being said, once you get used to wearing something like this you&#x27;ll notice a significant difference in the amount of light that gets through.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li>This eye mask is a gamechanger!</li>
            <li>The mask is very comfortable and blocks out the light very well.</li>
            <li>If you have a bigger nose, then this may not be a good fit for you.</li>
            <li>The fabric is super comfortable, not scratchy at all.</li>
            <li>The mask is effective yet comfortable and soft.  </li>
            <li>Also, rid yourself of the alarm clock with the bright digital display, get rid of any night lights, tape over or eliminate in the bedroom any and all devices that are lit at night including light switches or even some fire alarms.</li>
            <li>Foil is cheap and southern and a lot of people do it for very good reason, b/c it works better than just about anything, especially if you tape up the seams well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very comfortable and stays on while asleep very well.</li>
            <li>Very happy with this product - I get up really early and am lucky enough that I have time to take a nap during my lunch break at work.</li>
            <li>and these seem quite nice and soft.</li>
            <li>Since using this sleeping mask I have not taken one sleeping pill and have gotten numerous nights of good sleep.</li>
            <li>I began to look at the many, many, many other options on Amazon.</li>
            <li>This mask is very comfortable, completely blocks out light and doesn&#x27;t smash against my eyes.  </li>
            <li>Completely blocks any light and very comfortable.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the fact that it is molded rather than filled with stuffing as with many eye masks (or just flat fabric as with really cheap eye masks).</li>
            <li>The clasp sometimes clips onto your hair (but that&#x27;s my own fault for not being more careful), but other than that it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li>The clasp sometimes clips onto your hair (but that&#x27;s my own fault for not being more careful), but other than that it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li>This mask is different, and possibly one of the best I&#x27;ve ever worn to bed.</li>
            <li>I dee, soft terry masks are more comfortable</li>
            <li>It&#x27;d make a great gift too, and comes in a very pretty box!k did not have, and it is a feature that a I REALLY appreciated on this specific mask.</li>
            <li>It has a very pretty leafy design (I got the Emerald Forest print) and fits well to my face.</li>
            <li>It has a very pretty leafy design (I got the Emerald Forest print) and fits well to my face.</li>
            <li>I was told that this mask is perfect because it doesn&#x27;t sit right on the eyes, (apparently your eyes can dry out of pressed on by sleeping masks)</li>
            <li>I Highly recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li>and I have very snaggly fine hair.</li>
            <li>Also does completely block out the light which I love because I&#x27;m very sensitive to light</li>
            <li>This mask was comfortable on my eyes, But the place that stored the ear plugs really aggravated my ear(I have an &#x27;industrial cartilage piercing).</li>
            <li>Have been using this during the day and it really keeps the light out while I sleep.  </li>
            <li>The straps hold very well and it&#x27;s comfortable</li>
            <li>it really blocks out the light as well as</li>
            <li>I can open and close my eyes comfortably without ever touching the mask.</li>
            <li>Ideally we should all try to strive for an on-back position with a pillow to support the knees and put the spine in proper alignment  as well as a pillow that properly supports the neck -- but believe me,</li>
            <li>/&gt;Addition: While I love how comfortable and well designed this mask is it fell apart recently.</li>
            <li>Last night, and although the buckle enclosure is a nice feature, it&#x27;s still got stuck in my hair.</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t found one that completely blocked out the light or was comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li>I have pretty average head size, so I think I can fairly say that this mask can be adjusted to fit anyone.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The earplugs are a nice touch if you&#x27;re buying this set to travel you never know what you&#x27;ll have to endure from noisy neighbors in the room next door or partying in the streets below.</li>
            <li>Totally worth the money</li>
            <li>/&gt;The mask is nice and dark and fit both myself and my wife</li>
            <li>also I can open my eyes while wearing the mask which is cool :).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m debating now on whether it&#x27;s worth the money for a new one or if I should start searching again for a mask as comfortable as this.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to start tying knots again, especially on a new mask.</li>
            <li>The material feels comfortable against my skin and does block out all the light when fitted properly.</li>
            <li>because I like the owl print on it), but this one is half the price and just as good in quality-</li>
            <li>I seem to be very sensitive to light when sleeping.  </li>
            <li>, it also becomes upbearingly hot and sweaty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Very helpful for someone who works night shift!  </li>
            <li>Soft, comfortable, like a hug for my face.</li>
            <li>Seriously, I get a half hour more sleep a night basically, which is PRICELESS.</li>
            <li>it blocks light completely-</li>
            <li>Gave the first one to my dad, who wanted to try it.  </li>
            <li>first thing I noticed about this sleeping mask was the thickness.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t, however, speak on the ear plugs as I use others with a higher dB rating.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t rest directly on my eyes, so my eyes can move freely as I sleep.</li>
            <li>This product came exactly as shown and described.</li>
            <li>Only pro is the clip closure doesn&#x27;t snag my hair, will most likely remover strap &amp; attach to a better mask.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried the ear plugs, but the mask does exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>/eyelids which feels more sanitary than flat masks.</li>
            <li>I love how the mask is contoured and not just a flat piece of fabric.</li>
            <li>These conform perfectly to your face, they are super comfy and you can open your eyes in them which I think helps make you believe it&#x27;s still dark out to go back to sleep.</li>
            <li>This sleep mask is perfect and I really love the lavender earplugs that help block the noise coming from the hall and from my roommate‚Äôs often annoying</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t completely block sound, but do muffle sound enough so that it is not bothersome.</li>
            <li>I have tried out a few different sleep masks over the years and this is one of the ones that I have liked the most.</li>
            <li>She especially likes the buckle strap that is so easy to adjust.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a large nose, so that might be another reason why it wouldn&#x27;t stay in place?</li>
            <li>Having unnecessary sources of light flooding my bedroom (7 windows(!), a spotlight-like set top box display, a street light right outside my bedroom window, a neighbor who seems to think my bedroom windows need to be decoratively lit by his outdoor lighting, etc.), these sleep masks do exactly what I need: keep the light out.</li>
            <li>The mask blocks out light very well, and yet if I open my eyes, I don&#x27;t feel smothered.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a tiny sliver of light that shows around the edge of the mask in a bright room, but in a dim place it is imperceptible.  </li>
            <li>I find that I&#x27;m sleeping harder and better.  </li>
            <li>would really LIKE A REFUND</li>
            <li>I really recommend.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a really well-designed product.</li>
            <li>The eye areas are concave so your eyes can open and blink comfortably.  </li>
            <li>Very well made.</li>
            <li>There was a study done re sleeping and melatonin where all light was blocked in the bedroom visually, *except*</li>
            <li>very important.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>It is very soothing.</li>
            <li>I really do like it.</li>
            <li>So reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>, maybe I move around too much.  </li>
            <li>Comfortable enough that I wear them all night.</li>
            <li>I think if you had straight here, you would never have that problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It may just be me, but I really don&#x27;t like wearing earplugs anyway.</li>
            <li>I really have no idea</li>
            <li>One thing I&#x27;ve noticed that really helps are sleeping masks.</li>
            <li>It truly does create a blacked out environment that is really</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I do really like this mask.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I do really like this mask.</li>
            <li>It really helps.</li>
            <li>But considering how much I use this mask (sometimes up to 18 hours in a day) I&#x27;d still recommend it and have stocked up</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s adjustable (won&#x27;t stretch out and become unusable without altering like a straight elastic band).</li>
            <li>I really appreciate that it has a buckle instead of Velcro, which always caught on my hair.</li>
            <li>Overall, it is comfortable.</li>
            <li>This really helps me to refocus on trying to get to sleep</li>
            <li>Totally blocks out the light from my husband watching tv after I go to sleep.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new at wearing these and this is the first model I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Second one from this company and just as good as the other one-</li>
            <li>so usually I just sort of suffer with the light and doze lightly until he&#x27;s done.</li>
            <li>But I usually buy these from TJMaxx for much cheaper but the ones I got here were a nice buy.</li>
            <li>Wonderfully comfortable, and fits well on my narrow nose bridge to completely block out light.  </li>
            <li>I was worried that a sleep mask would feel strange, but this is so comfortable</li>
            <li>I live in a very street-light lit area.</li>
            <li>The cure pattern (with black fabric inside, blocking out all light) helps me like this product, too!</li>
            <li>I have tried several different sleep masks and this is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>i sleep in an area that has several street lamps outside my window- with this, i am sleeping better since for me</li>
            <li>i love the green design- very soothing</li>
            <li>I also have insomnia problems and take sleeping pills to get a decent night sleep.</li>
            <li>the main thing that I like about this mask is that it does not have Velcro.  </li>
            <li>The nose coverage area is also smaller but that actually works way better for my face shape and nose.  </li>
            <li>The only downside is that some light comes through near the nose area but just adjust it</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this mask.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone who works Grave shifts like I do and have to be asleep during the day.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I usually figure out some way to make these more comfy by replacing the elastic with something smoother, but I&#x27;m glad that it isn&#x27;t so sharp and isn&#x27;t grabbing onto my hair.</li>
            <li>The nose is also staying in place a little better and it is not plugging my nose like another one did.</li>
            <li>it shifts extremely easily and I find myself with no coverage on one eye or the other.</li>
            <li>it is really cushiony and soft-</li>
            <li>I have tried a few others and just have not been satisfied.  </li>
            <li>and I appreciate that our doesn&#x27;t press against my eyelids, but the band is right above my ears and grinds into the crease between my ears and head</li>
            <li>So, I found myself on a search for a new one.</li>
            <li>It was flimsy and didn&#x27;t have the room for the eyes like this new ones does.  </li>
            <li>I used these Saturday on a 13 hour flight from Auckland, New Zealand</li>
            <li>The adjustable clasp with this one is much more secure on my head but not at all uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li>I have only had it for a bit but compared to other masks I&#x27;ve had it doesn&#x27;t stretch easy.</li>
            <li>This is product is a complete rip</li>
            <li>I also have a 8 month old</li>
            <li>as a result it feels harsh on the skin and doesn&#x27;t move with the face to prevent light from coming in.</li>
            <li>It did take me just a bit to get used to it because I was using an old one I&#x27;ve had for years.</li>
            <li>That is something that my Etsy eye mask did not have, and it is a feature that a I REALLY appreciated on this specific mask.</li>
            <li>so it is not resting directly on your eyes.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for complete darkness as I am a nurse who works night shift and must sleep through the days..</li>
            <li>she has them on loud.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes so good that I actually wake up tired.</li>
            <li>The strap has a little buckle on at the back and is easy to adjust.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It blocks light completely, and as a migraineur that is very important when I&#x27;m suffering as even the littlest bits of lights are painful.  </li>
            <li>so have small gaps where light can get through.</li>
            <li>I will be ordereing another one soon :O)</li>
            <li>first - btw, white board will only block 30% at most unfortunately</li>
            <li>you stay put especially because the earplugs are near the strap.</li>
            <li>I just washed the eye mask and the fabric on the front and back has completely come off.</li>
            <li>Oh, and the color is nice but irrelevant cause</li>
            <li>They also take a few days to get used to, but I feel they are worth it.</li>
            <li>It was kind of weird, I ended up taking out the earplugs just because they were getting on my nerves.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t snag or uncomfortably indent into back of head and fully blocks light with the little nose fitting.</li>
            <li>If you can manage to back sleep consistently, the mask works extremely well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also get headaches easily from side pressure on my temples which I have pleasantly not had any issue with while using this mask.</li>
            <li>The first one I picked up at a big box retailer for less than $3.</li>
            <li>I ordered the green one first.  </li>
            <li>When you first hold it, it seems stiff but don&#x27;t let that fool you.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve slept much better the past few nights since receiving the item.</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;snag free&amp;#34; clasp is truly snag free, which delights me because with thick curly hair EVERYTHING snags and I was a skeptic until I tried it!</li>
            <li>I have had some in the past and they are very basic and they had to be just right</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I&#x27;m looking forward to many wonderful nights of sleep with this mask!</li>
            <li> For me this sleep mask is okay, at best.</li>
            <li> I liked these but forgot them on the plane!</li>
            <li> The nose piece conforms perfectly and leaves no gaps for light to go through.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fairly comfy, and it doesn&#x27;t leave lines on my face, sot</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mask fit my head perfectly.</li>

            <li> Love this mask!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this mask!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;d make a great gift too, and comes in a very pretty box!</li>
            <li> And of course it blocks light just great.</li>
            <li> They are designed with a kind of cup configuration covering your eyes so there is no pressure on the eyes at all.</li>
            <li> The adjustable strap is a nice touch, too.</li>
            <li> So it kind of just kept pushing them in or moving the ear plugs also.</li>
            <li> did like how around the eyes, that there is room for your eyes to blink and not rub on any kind of material.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discounted rate for an honest review.</li>
            <li> The clasp adjustment on the strap is nice, doesn&#x27;t get stuck in my hair.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve used a variety of sleep mask over the years, this one is by far the best!  </li>
            <li> Super cute design &amp; amazing product!</li>
            <li> She thinks this one is beautiful and fits very well.</li>
            <li> About a week into sleeping with this mask, very comfortable.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable design.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very comfortable.</li>
            <li> The contoured face is very comfortable,</li>
            <li> All in all, a very comfortable mask for me.</li>
            <li> This eye mask is very comfortable.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable.</li>
            <li> Good product &amp; quick delivery</li>
            <li> I am 100% satisfied with this mask set.</li>
            <li> I love this mask.</li>
            <li> Though it was amazing on how it kept the light out, I really LOVE this one without the velcro.</li>
            <li> Best part, when you open and close your eyes, your eyes never touch the mask.  </li>
            <li> Also when I&#x27;m on my next plane trip, I can wear this without it smudging off my make-up, and get a great sleep!  </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m a martyr, what can I say? :-) )  </li>
            <li> Blocks out all light, despite my generously-sized nose!  </li>
            <li> I love how this fits me &amp; molds on my face.</li>
            <li> This is the most comfortable sleep mask I&#x27;ve ever owned!</li>
            <li> Someone needs to build a better mousetrap sleep mask.</li>
            <li> This mask doesn&#x27;t crush your eyeballs like most.</li>
            <li> The earplugs are excellent - I would definitely purchase them again.</li>
            <li> This mask is great because it is concave and very lightweight.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I&#x27;ve gotten this mask I&#x27;ve found myself sleeping better and feeling more rested when I wake.</li>
            <li> this sleep mask is WAY more comfortable than the others!  </li>
            <li> Wearing the mask definately helps me have a better and deeper sleep.  </li>
            <li> think that it&#x27;s not a horrible product, but it&#x27;s just not for</li>
            <li> This mask does completely block all light when positioned perfectly.</li>
            <li> I have not been able to keep this on throughout the night.</li>
            <li> I purchased a homemade one on Etsy that is still my favorite (</li>
            <li> I love this sleep mask.</li>
            <li> The earplugs we comfortable and the carrying case is nice too.</li>
            <li> ( I never am able to sleep on planes).</li>
            <li> Cute pattern and I like the adjustable strap.</li>
            <li> Luv how it fits over your nose to keep even more light out!</li>
            <li> This one seems better than others I have tried recently, mostly since it doesn&#x27;t have velcro.</li>
            <li> I am beyond pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li> And I love that it doesn&#x27;t have a hook and loop fastener.  </li>
            <li> I love that the fit is adjustable and because I am Asian with a small/flat nose, this mask works perfectly.  </li>
            <li> Good and pretty mask, indispensible for day sleepers.</li>
            <li> The band is adjustable, But the snugger the fit, the greater the ear irritation and pressure on my head.</li>
            <li> Love this- comfortable and soothing-</li>
            <li> Sleeping while it&#x27;s light out is more than a challenge.</li>
            <li> thing that I really love about this mask is that it&#x27;s contoured to fit around the bridge of your nose.</li>
            <li> The eye mask is comfortable and I have been able to sleep wearing the mask.</li>
            <li> so I would guess that it would fit more adults without a problem.</li>
            <li> With the mask and earplugs, I shut my office door and am able to get a fantastic power nap.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the freedom of being able to move my eyelids.</li>
            <li> Very quality sewn and made with good materials.</li>
            <li> Very quality sewn and made with good materials.</li>
            <li> Totally cool product!</li>
            <li> I love the mask it doesnt tangle in my hair and is light on your face but keeps out the light.  </li>
            <li> It arrived very quickly as well</li>
            <li> These have an easy to adjust buckle closure; you do not want a velcro sleep mask, it catches on your hair and is a pain to adjust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I find myself waking up easily</li>
            <li> The adjustable strap is easy to use and does not cause any snags in your hair or any discomfort.</li>
            <li> Being able to open my eyes with the mask on is a welcome change.</li>
            <li> You would think with the contour for your nose that it would fit snuggly and block out most of the light.</li>
            <li> It‚Äôs also a great way to get a natural drug free sleep</li>
            <li> Fit is super comfy, and works really well at keeping all light out!!!  </li>
            <li> This is hands down the best sleep mask I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> Buckle makes it easy to fit</li>
            <li> First off, there is no such thing as a perfect sleep mask.</li>
            <li> I was glad that it did provide full blockage from light.  </li>
            <li> all the light is blocked, and easy to adjust and is so comfy</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super light weight and smooth, the inside is molded leaving plenty of room for you to blink and it won&#x27;t squish and rub on your eye lashes and it stays very securely on your head.</li>
            <li> Most sleeping masks don&#x27;t adequate fit around your nose</li>
            <li> The cushioned edges are very comfortable and the strap is easily adjusted to fit just right.</li>
            <li> It blocks 99% of the light.</li>
            <li> The elastic band is comfortable and generously adjustable.</li>
            <li> The way they feel(or don&#x27;t, because you feel nothing, not even the elastic band) on the eyes is extremely comfortable.</li>
            <li> Comfortable strap.</li>
            <li> 100% blocks out the light and is comfortable on the face.  </li>
            <li> but then I saw this one and am so happy with it that I might even buy a red one for another variety.  </li>
            <li> It keeps light out</li>
            <li> /&gt;Comfortable, close fit, with a buckle adjustable strap.</li>
            <li> I have light coming in to my bedroom transom windows.  </li>
            <li> It fit well and never caught in my hair or pulled in any way.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d suggest not to just rely on a sleep mask alone at home; do whatever you can do in your bedroom to reduce or eliminate any light seeping in.</li>
            <li> Allows for free eye movement and blinking throughout  the night;</li>
            <li> Although the nose bridge somewhat helps to block light, it sometimes doesn&#x27;t if the mask shifts up.&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t work as well if you side sleep.</li>
            <li> and it keeps all light out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s comfortable and I like the design.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s stays comfortably in place during sleeps and blocks out all light.</li>
            <li> When I remove the mask, I&#x27;m always surprised at how bright it is.</li>
            <li> Having a buckle closure instead of velcro is fantastic because 1) it doesn&#x27;t get stuck in my hair and 2)</li>
            <li> (Plus you get free earplugs too</li>
            <li> The mask blocks out all the light.</li>
            <li> It shields the wind and the light when he reads before bed.  </li>
            <li> The molded cups are fantastic and do not prevent me from opening my eyes.  </li>
            <li> And because of that alittle light shines through around the nose.</li>
            <li> The headband is comfortable for side sleeping which can be a problem with bands with bulkier buckles.</li>
            <li> Blocks light like it is supposed to, does not crush eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Contours to the face well to not let any light in around the nose area.</li>
            <li> This mask keeps the light out and is comfortable.</li>
            <li> It blocks virtually all light.  </li>
            <li> It stays in place, comfortably.  </li>
            <li> The mask is ok, not that comfortable to worth this price.</li>
            <li> With that being said, once you get used to wearing something like this you&#x27;ll notice a significant difference in the amount of light that gets through.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> This eye mask is a gamechanger!</li>
            <li> The mask is very comfortable and blocks out the light very well.</li>
            <li> If you have a bigger nose, then this may not be a good fit for you.</li>
            <li> The fabric is super comfortable, not scratchy at all.</li>
            <li> The mask is effective yet comfortable and soft.  </li>
            <li> Also, rid yourself of the alarm clock with the bright digital display, get rid of any night lights, tape over or eliminate in the bedroom any and all devices that are lit at night including light switches or even some fire alarms.</li>
            <li> Foil is cheap and southern and a lot of people do it for very good reason, b/c it works better than just about anything, especially if you tape up the seams well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very comfortable and stays on while asleep very well.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product - I get up really early and am lucky enough that I have time to take a nap during my lunch break at work.</li>
            <li> and these seem quite nice and soft.</li>
            <li> Since using this sleeping mask I have not taken one sleeping pill and have gotten numerous nights of good sleep.</li>
            <li> I began to look at the many, many, many other options on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This mask is very comfortable, completely blocks out light and doesn&#x27;t smash against my eyes.  </li>
            <li> Completely blocks any light and very comfortable.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the fact that it is molded rather than filled with stuffing as with many eye masks (or just flat fabric as with really cheap eye masks).</li>
            <li> The clasp sometimes clips onto your hair (but that&#x27;s my own fault for not being more careful), but other than that it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> The clasp sometimes clips onto your hair (but that&#x27;s my own fault for not being more careful), but other than that it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> This mask is different, and possibly one of the best I&#x27;ve ever worn to bed.</li>
            <li> I dee, soft terry masks are more comfortable</li>
            <li> It&#x27;d make a great gift too, and comes in a very pretty box!k did not have, and it is a feature that a I REALLY appreciated on this specific mask.</li>
            <li> It has a very pretty leafy design (I got the Emerald Forest print) and fits well to my face.</li>
            <li> It has a very pretty leafy design (I got the Emerald Forest print) and fits well to my face.</li>
            <li> I was told that this mask is perfect because it doesn&#x27;t sit right on the eyes, (apparently your eyes can dry out of pressed on by sleeping masks)</li>
            <li> I Highly recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> and I have very snaggly fine hair.</li>
            <li> Also does completely block out the light which I love because I&#x27;m very sensitive to light</li>
            <li> This mask was comfortable on my eyes, But the place that stored the ear plugs really aggravated my ear(I have an &#x27;industrial cartilage piercing).</li>
            <li> Have been using this during the day and it really keeps the light out while I sleep.  </li>
            <li> The straps hold very well and it&#x27;s comfortable</li>
            <li> it really blocks out the light as well as</li>
            <li> I can open and close my eyes comfortably without ever touching the mask.</li>
            <li> Ideally we should all try to strive for an on-back position with a pillow to support the knees and put the spine in proper alignment  as well as a pillow that properly supports the neck -- but believe me,</li>
            <li> /&gt;Addition: While I love how comfortable and well designed this mask is it fell apart recently.</li>
            <li> Last night, and although the buckle enclosure is a nice feature, it&#x27;s still got stuck in my hair.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t found one that completely blocked out the light or was comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li> I have pretty average head size, so I think I can fairly say that this mask can be adjusted to fit anyone.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The earplugs are a nice touch if you&#x27;re buying this set to travel you never know what you&#x27;ll have to endure from noisy neighbors in the room next door or partying in the streets below.</li>
            <li> Totally worth the money</li>
            <li> /&gt;The mask is nice and dark and fit both myself and my wife</li>
            <li> also I can open my eyes while wearing the mask which is cool :).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m debating now on whether it&#x27;s worth the money for a new one or if I should start searching again for a mask as comfortable as this.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to start tying knots again, especially on a new mask.</li>
            <li> The material feels comfortable against my skin and does block out all the light when fitted properly.</li>
            <li> because I like the owl print on it), but this one is half the price and just as good in quality-</li>
            <li> I seem to be very sensitive to light when sleeping.  </li>
            <li> , it also becomes upbearingly hot and sweaty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Very helpful for someone who works night shift!  </li>
            <li> Soft, comfortable, like a hug for my face.</li>
            <li> Seriously, I get a half hour more sleep a night basically, which is PRICELESS.</li>
            <li> it blocks light completely-</li>
            <li> Gave the first one to my dad, who wanted to try it.  </li>
            <li> first thing I noticed about this sleeping mask was the thickness.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t, however, speak on the ear plugs as I use others with a higher dB rating.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t rest directly on my eyes, so my eyes can move freely as I sleep.</li>
            <li> This product came exactly as shown and described.</li>
            <li> Only pro is the clip closure doesn&#x27;t snag my hair, will most likely remover strap &amp; attach to a better mask.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the ear plugs, but the mask does exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> /eyelids which feels more sanitary than flat masks.</li>
            <li> I love how the mask is contoured and not just a flat piece of fabric.</li>
            <li> These conform perfectly to your face, they are super comfy and you can open your eyes in them which I think helps make you believe it&#x27;s still dark out to go back to sleep.</li>
            <li> This sleep mask is perfect and I really love the lavender earplugs that help block the noise coming from the hall and from my roommate‚Äôs often annoying</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t completely block sound, but do muffle sound enough so that it is not bothersome.</li>
            <li> I have tried out a few different sleep masks over the years and this is one of the ones that I have liked the most.</li>
            <li> She especially likes the buckle strap that is so easy to adjust.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a large nose, so that might be another reason why it wouldn&#x27;t stay in place?</li>
            <li> Having unnecessary sources of light flooding my bedroom (7 windows(!), a spotlight-like set top box display, a street light right outside my bedroom window, a neighbor who seems to think my bedroom windows need to be decoratively lit by his outdoor lighting, etc.), these sleep masks do exactly what I need: keep the light out.</li>
            <li> The mask blocks out light very well, and yet if I open my eyes, I don&#x27;t feel smothered.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a tiny sliver of light that shows around the edge of the mask in a bright room, but in a dim place it is imperceptible.  </li>
            <li> I find that I&#x27;m sleeping harder and better.  </li>
            <li> would really LIKE A REFUND</li>
            <li> I really recommend.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really well-designed product.</li>
            <li> The eye areas are concave so your eyes can open and blink comfortably.  </li>
            <li> Very well made.</li>
            <li> There was a study done re sleeping and melatonin where all light was blocked in the bedroom visually, *except*</li>
            <li> very important.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> It is very soothing.</li>
            <li> I really do like it.</li>
            <li> So reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> , maybe I move around too much.  </li>
            <li> Comfortable enough that I wear them all night.</li>
            <li> I think if you had straight here, you would never have that problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It may just be me, but I really don&#x27;t like wearing earplugs anyway.</li>
            <li> I really have no idea</li>
            <li> One thing I&#x27;ve noticed that really helps are sleeping masks.</li>
            <li> It truly does create a blacked out environment that is really</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I do really like this mask.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I do really like this mask.</li>
            <li> It really helps.</li>
            <li> But considering how much I use this mask (sometimes up to 18 hours in a day) I&#x27;d still recommend it and have stocked up</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s adjustable (won&#x27;t stretch out and become unusable without altering like a straight elastic band).</li>
            <li> I really appreciate that it has a buckle instead of Velcro, which always caught on my hair.</li>
            <li> Overall, it is comfortable.</li>
            <li> This really helps me to refocus on trying to get to sleep</li>
            <li> Totally blocks out the light from my husband watching tv after I go to sleep.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new at wearing these and this is the first model I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Second one from this company and just as good as the other one-</li>
            <li> so usually I just sort of suffer with the light and doze lightly until he&#x27;s done.</li>
            <li> But I usually buy these from TJMaxx for much cheaper but the ones I got here were a nice buy.</li>
            <li> Wonderfully comfortable, and fits well on my narrow nose bridge to completely block out light.  </li>
            <li> I was worried that a sleep mask would feel strange, but this is so comfortable</li>
            <li> I live in a very street-light lit area.</li>
            <li> The cure pattern (with black fabric inside, blocking out all light) helps me like this product, too!</li>
            <li> I have tried several different sleep masks and this is my favorite.  </li>
            <li> i sleep in an area that has several street lamps outside my window- with this, i am sleeping better since for me</li>
            <li> i love the green design- very soothing</li>
            <li> I also have insomnia problems and take sleeping pills to get a decent night sleep.</li>
            <li> the main thing that I like about this mask is that it does not have Velcro.  </li>
            <li> The nose coverage area is also smaller but that actually works way better for my face shape and nose.  </li>
            <li> The only downside is that some light comes through near the nose area but just adjust it</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this mask.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to anyone who works Grave shifts like I do and have to be asleep during the day.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I usually figure out some way to make these more comfy by replacing the elastic with something smoother, but I&#x27;m glad that it isn&#x27;t so sharp and isn&#x27;t grabbing onto my hair.</li>
            <li> The nose is also staying in place a little better and it is not plugging my nose like another one did.</li>
            <li> it shifts extremely easily and I find myself with no coverage on one eye or the other.</li>
            <li> it is really cushiony and soft-</li>
            <li> I have tried a few others and just have not been satisfied.  </li>
            <li> and I appreciate that our doesn&#x27;t press against my eyelids, but the band is right above my ears and grinds into the crease between my ears and head</li>
            <li> So, I found myself on a search for a new one.</li>
            <li> It was flimsy and didn&#x27;t have the room for the eyes like this new ones does.  </li>
            <li> I used these Saturday on a 13 hour flight from Auckland, New Zealand</li>
            <li> The adjustable clasp with this one is much more secure on my head but not at all uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> I have only had it for a bit but compared to other masks I&#x27;ve had it doesn&#x27;t stretch easy.</li>
            <li> This is product is a complete rip</li>
            <li> I also have a 8 month old</li>
            <li> as a result it feels harsh on the skin and doesn&#x27;t move with the face to prevent light from coming in.</li>
            <li> It did take me just a bit to get used to it because I was using an old one I&#x27;ve had for years.</li>
            <li> That is something that my Etsy eye mask did not have, and it is a feature that a I REALLY appreciated on this specific mask.</li>
            <li> so it is not resting directly on your eyes.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for complete darkness as I am a nurse who works night shift and must sleep through the days..</li>
            <li> she has them on loud.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes so good that I actually wake up tired.</li>
            <li> The strap has a little buckle on at the back and is easy to adjust.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It blocks light completely, and as a migraineur that is very important when I&#x27;m suffering as even the littlest bits of lights are painful.  </li>
            <li> so have small gaps where light can get through.</li>
            <li> I will be ordereing another one soon :O)</li>
            <li> first - btw, white board will only block 30% at most unfortunately</li>
            <li> you stay put especially because the earplugs are near the strap.</li>
            <li> I just washed the eye mask and the fabric on the front and back has completely come off.</li>
            <li> Oh, and the color is nice but irrelevant cause</li>
            <li> They also take a few days to get used to, but I feel they are worth it.</li>
            <li> It was kind of weird, I ended up taking out the earplugs just because they were getting on my nerves.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t snag or uncomfortably indent into back of head and fully blocks light with the little nose fitting.</li>
            <li> If you can manage to back sleep consistently, the mask works extremely well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also get headaches easily from side pressure on my temples which I have pleasantly not had any issue with while using this mask.</li>
            <li> The first one I picked up at a big box retailer for less than $3.</li>
            <li> I ordered the green one first.  </li>
            <li> When you first hold it, it seems stiff but don&#x27;t let that fool you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve slept much better the past few nights since receiving the item.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;snag free&amp;#34; clasp is truly snag free, which delights me because with thick curly hair EVERYTHING snags and I was a skeptic until I tried it!</li>
            <li> I have had some in the past and they are very basic and they had to be just right</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually up early on the weekends due to the sunlight reflecting off my mirrored closet doors and shining in my face but now, using the sleep mask, I sometimes sleep until 9 or later.</li>
            <li> I live in the city and need pitch black to sleep.</li>
            <li> Initially, the design was strange to me due to the cupped look of them, which is one reason I steered clear of it before.</li>
            <li> They are total black out, soft and non- drying to the eyes.</li>
            <li> It has two small &#x27;adjustable&#x27; straps with bizarre small plastic clips whose purpose I could not determine as there were no instructions.</li>
            <li> (if you are concerned about the external aesthetics carefully tape up an overlapping layer of white poster board</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it would cover 100% if I didn&#x27;t have a crooked nose due to it being broken a few times.</li>
            <li> Also, it has a clip which does not interfere with my long hair.</li>
            <li> your eyes are closed and the pattern is on the outside!</li>
            <li> Had I known, I&#x27;d have purchased it a LONG time ago.</li>
            <li> So far it hasn&#x27;t gotten tangled in my hair, although sometimes I do accidently clasp a few strands of hair into the clip and it pulls them out when I roll around.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and Velcro</li>
            <li> and it still slipped off my head because the elastic had quickly stretched out.  </li>
            <li> It does have a tendency to slip off my hair in the night after I am asleep, and it is not completely light-tight around the bridge of my nose, but those aren&#x27;t deal breakers for me. .</li>
            <li> there was one small pinpoint light aimed at the back of the knee and even though the subjects could not see it and the room still appeared to be dark, this had a measurable negative impact on sleep and melatonin</li>
            <li> If you like this mask you&#x27;ll probably want to get another one as a backup for sanitary reasons as the mask should be handwashed once a week; don&#x27;t put in a washing machine and air dry.</li>
            <li> I figured if my eyes were blocked, they wouldn&#x27;t dry out</li>
            <li> &#x27;er dark as possible folks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I hesitated to get an eye mask because the only one I&#x27;d ever had was uncomfortable: the elastic band was too tight and the fabric was sort of rough, and it felt like it impeded my ability to breathe as freely as I wanted through my nose.</li>
            <li> It stays put well even when worn loosely.  </li>
            <li> Then one sunny morning sleeping late, my husband borrowed my new one.</li>
            <li> Be careful when ordering because there are two that look almost identical, one is several dollars less</li>
            <li> I had it as tight as I could possibly close it</li>
            <li> After using a couple of different sleep masks, alternately over the past few years and requiring one every night, I finally wore them out.</li>
            <li> The mask can be adjusted with little sliding adjusters and then has a clasp in the back that secures the mask around your head.</li>
            <li> There was really no way for me to force this to</li>
            <li> This mask is completely different than any I&#x27;ve tried and as someone who has trouble sleeping, I&#x27;ve tried them all.</li>
            <li> Such a waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> first- especially if you&#x27;re used to the thin silk masks that are commonly sold.</li>
            <li> The other just wore out.</li>
            <li> Also like the adjustable strap, so it won&#x27;t stretch out like other masks.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was not able to handle all of the lights out, but I do toss and turn throughout the night and it moved with me, where I was constantly having to adjust it.</li>
            <li> I bought this sleep mask for the buckle closure, which doesn&#x27;t snag my hair like the Velcro on the other sleep mask.</li>
            <li> The frame is alittle big for my small face..</li>
            <li> : After six months of regular use, the black face-side backing has completely come off, exposing the foam which has a sticky, uncomfortable feel.</li>
            <li> The inside is a little rough, but it is tolerable.</li>
            <li> The one negative is that it it doesn&#x27;t come with a proper case for travel, just a cardboard box.</li>
            <li> This thing is dark.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I always wake up without the mask, always.  </li>
            <li> Rough fabric, not light tight.</li>
            <li> and if I lay on my side or just have it a little low it is hard against my nose.</li>

            <li> After using a couple of different sleep masks, alternately over the past few years and requiring one every night, I finally wore them out. They weren&#x27;t the best quality and as the elastic wore I found myself tying knots on the back to keep it snug on my face on one. The other just wore out. So, I found myself on a search for a new one. The first one I picked up at a big box retailer for less than $3. It can be found on Amazon for about the same price. It has two small &#x27;adjustable&#x27; straps with bizarre small plastic clips whose purpose I could not determine as there were no instructions. They would not stay firm on my face and slid off my eyes repeatedly throughout the night. I didn&#x27;t want to start tying knots again, especially on a new mask. This would not work. I began to look at the many, many, many other options on Amazon. The next mask I bought were the ones that have &#x27;slots&#x27; on the elastic headband to store ear plugs. This mask was comfortable on my eyes, But the place that stored the ear plugs really aggravated my ear(I have an &#x27;industrial cartilage piercing). The mask constantly shifted from my eyes throughout the night. The band is adjustable, But the snugger the fit, the greater the ear irritation and pressure on my head. This, also would not work. So, the hunt continued. I remembered these from my previous searches and decided to give it a try. Initially, the design was strange to me due to the cupped look of them, which is one reason I steered clear of it before. Well, now I have it and what can I say? They are awesome! They are designed with a kind of cup configuration covering your eyes so there is no pressure on the eyes at all. It blocks 99% of the light. I&#x27;m sure it would cover 100% if I didn&#x27;t have a crooked nose due to it being broken a few times. The elastic band is comfortable and generously adjustable. Also, it has a clip which does not interfere with my long hair. I can see how it would be beneficial to someone who is trying to preserve a hair style overnight and needs to clip it together rather than stretching it over the head. I do not feel it while sleeping. This mask is a set that also comes with 2 pair of memory foam type ear plugs. I don&#x27;t use ear plugs, but have in the past and these seem quite nice and soft. They come in a small plastic travel case. I am 100% satisfied with this mask set. The way they feel(or don&#x27;t, because you feel nothing, not even the elastic band) on the eyes is extremely comfortable. I only with wish I had found this design years ago. I can&#x27;t see myself buying a different type of mask ever again. Oh, and the color is nice but irrelevant cause your eyes are closed and the pattern is on the outside! Although it is an attractive color/pattern. I highly recommend this mask. Buy this set and be done with it!</li>
            <li> About a week into sleeping with this mask, very comfortable. Gives room for eyelashes during REM. Comfortable strap.</li>
            <li> Love, love this sleep mask! It&#x27;s super light weight and smooth, the inside is molded leaving plenty of room for you to blink and it won&#x27;t squish and rub on your eye lashes and it stays very securely on your head. The best part though is how well it blocks out the light, 100%! The nose piece conforms perfectly and leaves no gaps for light to go through. Even standing in my kitchen in the middle of the day the mask creates total darkness. Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> I love this product! I find that I&#x27;m sleeping harder and better.  I&#x27;ve always been the person to wake up before my alarm.  Since I started using this sleep mask my alarm now wakes me up!</li>
            <li> I have tried several different sleep masks and this is my favorite.  100% blocks out the light and is comfortable on the face.  I Highly recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> I love the mask it doesnt tangle in my hair and is light on your face but keeps out the light.  I will be ordereing another one soon :O)</li>
            <li> I received thiss product on april 13th.&lt;br /&gt;Today - on May 16th i noticed it was coming apart at the seems.&lt;br /&gt;I went to return and I am 3 days late.  This is product is a complete rip off.&lt;br /&gt;In addition to it breaking, it also becomes upbearingly hot and sweaty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would really LIKE A REFUND</li>
            <li> This mask is very comfortable, completely blocks out light and doesn&#x27;t smash against my eyes.  I would recommend it!</li>
            <li> Quality eye mask. One of the nicest I&#x27;ve owned. Very comfortable design. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love this mask. I have had some in the past and they are very basic and they had to be just right or they were useless. This one has a spot for your nose and doesn&#x27;t smash you eyeballs into the mask. It&#x27;s a great pattern and it&#x27;s very comfortable. It arrived very quickly as well</li>
            <li> I have another sleeping mask, but this one has the velcro strap.  I have to admit, I don&#x27;t like the velcro because it has gotten caught in my hair and that made it for a very uncomfortable sleep. Though it was amazing on how it kept the light out, I really LOVE this one without the velcro. I would highly recommend this to anyone who works Grave shifts like I do and have to be asleep during the day.</li>
            <li> Love my eye mask!  Fit is super comfy, and works really well at keeping all light out!!!  Very helpful for someone who works night shift!  Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t snag or uncomfortably indent into back of head and fully blocks light with the little nose fitting.</li>
            <li> Great sleep mask!  And very cute fabric too.  Best part, when you open and close your eyes, your eyes never touch the mask.  Buckle makes it easy to fit so that&#x27;s great.  Also when I&#x27;m on my next plane trip, I can wear this without it smudging off my make-up, and get a great sleep!  Good stuff!</li>
            <li> This eye mask is a gamechanger! Had I known, I&#x27;d have purchased it a LONG time ago. My husband likes to watch TV a little longer than I do in bed at night, so usually I just sort of suffer with the light and doze lightly until he&#x27;s done. (I&#x27;m a martyr, what can I say? :-) )  I hesitated to get an eye mask because the only one I&#x27;d ever had was uncomfortable: the elastic band was too tight and the fabric was sort of rough, and it felt like it impeded my ability to breathe as freely as I wanted through my nose. But this mask ... whoa. It feels almost SOOTHING. Soft, comfortable, like a hug for my face. And of course it blocks light just great. Seriously, I get a half hour more sleep a night basically, which is PRICELESS.</li>
            <li> Love this- comfortable and soothing- i sleep in an area that has several street lamps outside my window- with this, i am sleeping better since for me it blocks light completely- it is really cushiony and soft- i love the green design- very soothing</li>
            <li> Second one from this company and just as good as the other one- I got a purple one a while ago and was going to buy a black one for a variation, but then I saw this one and am so happy with it that I might even buy a red one for another variety.  It has gotten so that the minute I put this mask on, I get into the going to sleep mode and I am out in what feels like seconds.  My partner is happy because she likes to read at night and I don&#x27;t ever bother her about it anymore.  I really recommend.</li>
            <li> Great eye mask.  Blocks out all light, despite my generously-sized nose!  The mask has room for my eyelashes, so I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s squishing my eyes.  The one negative is that it it doesn&#x27;t come with a proper case for travel, just a cardboard box.</li>
            <li> I love how this fits me &amp; molds on my face. I wake up refreshed &amp; feeling energized. I also have a 8 month old so that means I need rest &amp; this does do the trick. Highly recommend it</li>
            <li> I love that the fit is adjustable and because I am Asian with a small/flat nose, this mask works perfectly.  If you have a bigger nose, then this may not be a good fit for you.</li>
            <li> Good and pretty mask, indispensible for day sleepers.</li>
            <li> It works. It keeps light out and I appreciate that our doesn&#x27;t press against my eyelids, but the band is right above my ears and grinds into the crease between my ears and head or I jane to keep it on my ears, which is also uncomfortable. That and if I lay on my side or just have it a little low it is hard against my nose. I&#x27;m new at wearing these and this is the first model I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Really happy with this mask.  It holds its shape, so not only do you not wake up with lines all over your face, but it will also last longer than others.  Also like the adjustable strap, so it won&#x27;t stretch out like other masks. Comes with 2 pairs of high-quality earplugs &amp; a case, too, which is a bonus.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This is the most comfortable sleep mask I&#x27;ve ever owned! I can open and close my eyes comfortably without ever touching the mask. It&#x27;s a really well-designed product. The fabric is super comfortable, not scratchy at all. The adjustable strap is a nice touch, too. I&#x27;m looking forward to many wonderful nights of sleep with this mask!</li>
            <li> This is the second one of these I&#x27;ve purchased.  Gave the first one to my dad, who wanted to try it.  He sleeps with a mask, but liked this one so much better.  Then one sunny morning sleeping late, my husband borrowed my new one. I have a feeling I&#x27;ll be buying a third soon&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comfortable, close fit, with a buckle adjustable strap. This thing is dark.  Very dark.  Almost perfect, in fact.  The eye areas are concave so your eyes can open and blink comfortably.  Very well made.</li>
            <li> This is just what I needed.  I have light coming in to my bedroom transom windows.  The mask is effective yet comfortable and soft.  I hardly knew I was wearing it.  It fit well and never caught in my hair or pulled in any way.  Five stars for the &amp;#34;Drift to Sleep&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> First off, there is no such thing as a perfect sleep mask. Someone needs to build a better mousetrap sleep mask. ;-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d suggest not to just rely on a sleep mask alone at home; do whatever you can do in your bedroom to reduce or eliminate any light seeping in. Whatever it takes for the windows, including foil.  Foil is cheap and southern and a lot of people do it for very good reason, b/c it works better than just about anything, especially if you tape up the seams well. (if you are concerned about the external aesthetics carefully tape up an overlapping layer of white poster board first - btw, white board will only block 30% at most unfortunately so you need the foil too) Also, rid yourself of the alarm clock with the bright digital display, get rid of any night lights, tape over or eliminate in the bedroom any and all devices that are lit at night including light switches or even some fire alarms. There was a study done re sleeping and melatonin where all light was blocked in the bedroom visually, *except* there was one small pinpoint light aimed at the back of the knee and even though the subjects could not see it and the room still appeared to be dark, this had a measurable negative impact on sleep and melatonin levels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep &#x27;er dark as possible folks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if you do all this, these are great for travel situations and this is one of the best masks I&#x27;ve found. This review is for both the emerald and midnight roses masks as they are identical in functionality and I have both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Positives:&lt;br /&gt;- Contoured eye area. Allows for free eye movement and blinking throughout  the night; very important.&lt;br /&gt;- These have an easy to adjust buckle closure; you do not want a velcro sleep mask, it catches on your hair and is a pain to adjust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negs:&lt;br /&gt;- Although the nose bridge somewhat helps to block light, it sometimes doesn&#x27;t if the mask shifts up.&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t work as well if you side sleep. The mask will tend to shift around then.  Ideally we should all try to strive for an on-back position with a pillow to support the knees and put the spine in proper alignment  as well as a pillow that properly supports the neck -- but believe me, I know it is easier said than done sometimes as there is just something so primal and soothing about curling up in that left side position. If you can manage to back sleep consistently, the mask works extremely well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, 5 stars for the seller and 4 for the product. If you like this mask you&#x27;ll probably want to get another one as a backup for sanitary reasons as the mask should be handwashed once a week; don&#x27;t put in a washing machine and air dry.</li>
            <li> This mask doesn&#x27;t crush your eyeballs like most. It is very soothing.</li>
            <li> Have been using this during the day and it really keeps the light out while I sleep.  It also doesn&#x27;t mess up my makeup.</li>
            <li> the mask is shaped correctly. however, rather hard and inflexible. as a result it feels harsh on the skin and doesn&#x27;t move with the face to prevent light from coming in.</li>
            <li> The item was as described &amp; arrived in a timely manner. The material feels comfortable against my skin and does block out all the light when fitted properly. My only issue with it is that as soon as my head hits the pillow, the mask shifts (I sleep on my side). By the morning, the mask no longer covers my eyes, or I have lost it altogether. The earplugs are excellent - I would definitely purchase them again.</li>
            <li> Great mask- the contours make it comfy and it keeps all light out.</li>
            <li> It did take me just a bit to get used to it because I was using an old one I&#x27;ve had for years. It was flimsy and didn&#x27;t have the room for the eyes like this new ones does.  Once I got used to it I really do like it. The straps hold very well and it&#x27;s comfortable</li>
            <li> Massive street lights in front and back of house were always keeping me up at night. Regular masks hadn&#x27;t been helping because I&#x27;m a little claustrophobic and couldn&#x27;t handle the pressure on my eyes. This mask is great because it is concave and very lightweight. The mask blocks out light very well, and yet if I open my eyes, I don&#x27;t feel smothered. So reasonably priced. Excellent!</li>
            <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. It feels sturdy. It&#x27;s fairly comfy, and it doesn&#x27;t leave lines on my face, sot that&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> The mask is ok, not that comfortable to worth this price.</li>
            <li> One of the best purchases I&#x27;ve made this year.&lt;br /&gt;Due to working closes and dating someone who lives in Germany I end up sleeping a lot during the daylight hours. Sleeping while it&#x27;s light out is more than a challenge. I find myself waking up easily and often.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d been looking into a sleeping mask for a while before deciding on this one. It&#x27;s comfortable and I like the design. The strap is also adjustable which is nice.&lt;br /&gt;Since I&#x27;ve gotten this mask I&#x27;ve found myself sleeping better and feeling more rested when I wake. I&#x27;d definitely recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Addition: While I love how comfortable and well designed this mask is it fell apart recently. The material on the front and back began to peel away from the mask until they were only held on by the sewn part on the sides. This mask was really great but I would like a product that lasts. I&#x27;m debating now on whether it&#x27;s worth the money for a new one or if I should start searching again for a mask as comfortable as this.</li>
            <li> This is a great product! The shaped eye areas keep the mask from rubbing against my eyes/eyelids which feels more sanitary than flat masks. The cushioned edges are very comfortable and the strap is easily adjusted to fit just right. The &amp;#34;snag free&amp;#34; clasp is truly snag free, which delights me because with thick curly hair EVERYTHING snags and I was a skeptic until I tried it! I will recommend this and continue using it for years to come!&lt;br /&gt;Edit: After six months of regular use, the black face-side backing has completely come off, exposing the foam which has a sticky, uncomfortable feel. I&#x27;m not pleased with the durability of this product so I am reducing my rating from five stars to three.</li>
            <li> Awesome sleeping mask. When you first hold it, it seems stiff but don&#x27;t let that fool you. It&#x27;s stays comfortably in place during sleeps and blocks out all light. 100% reccomend.</li>
            <li> This is a great sleep mask and it&#x27;s really cute.  I keep it in the box to preserve it&#x27;s shape.  Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> this sleep mask is WAY more comfortable than the others!  I especially appreciate that the puffed out eye area doesn&#x27;t smush my eyelashes like the others did.  My only complaint is that I always wake up without the mask, always.  So maybe it is that my hair is slippery, maybe I move around too much.  Wearing the mask definately helps me have a better and deeper sleep.  After two comments from me, husband needed a mask too and loves his!.</li>
            <li> These work great! Comfortable enough that I wear them all night. No closterphobic feeling of pressure on eyes. Plus they are really cute!  The inside is a little rough, but it is tolerable.</li>
            <li> The mask is very comfortable and blocks out the light very well. The adjustable strap is easy to use and does not cause any snags in your hair or any discomfort. The ear plugs require some practice to place them correctly. They don&#x27;t completely block sound, but do muffle sound enough so that it is not bothersome. They also take a few days to get used to, but I feel they are worth it. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Last night, and although the buckle enclosure is a nice feature, it&#x27;s still got stuck in my hair. But maybe that&#x27;s because I have curly hair? I think if you had straight here, you would never have that problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was not able to handle all of the lights out, but I do toss and turn throughout the night and it moved with me, where I was constantly having to adjust it. There was really no way for me to force this to you stay put especially because the earplugs are near the strap. So it kind of just kept pushing them in or moving the ear plugs also. It was kind of weird, I ended up taking out the earplugs just because they were getting on my nerves. It may just be me, but I really don&#x27;t like wearing earplugs anyway. So I&#x27;m not going to take a star away from that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did like how around the eyes, that there is room for your eyes to blink and not rub on any kind of material. I wish that there was a way to make this day in place while I toss and turn, without my head feeling like it was going to explode from having to adjust it so tightly around my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The material is really soft, and the only real bad thing about it was that I had a hard time keeping it in place, and that made it difficult to keep the light out.. I don&#x27;t have a large nose, so that might be another reason why it wouldn&#x27;t stay in place? I really have no idea why I just know that I could not get it to stay in place unless I just wasn&#x27;t moving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that it&#x27;s not a horrible product, but it&#x27;s just not for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discounted rate for an honest review.</li>
            <li> This mask is completely different than any I&#x27;ve tried and as someone who has trouble sleeping, I&#x27;ve tried them all. Being able to open my eyes with the mask on is a welcome change. I wear and sleep with contacts - I had hoped that this would help keep my eyes from drying out from the ceiling fan. I figured if my eyes were blocked, they wouldn&#x27;t dry out but that isn&#x27;t the case. So I guess I can quit blaming the fan. This mask does completely block all light when positioned perfectly. The problem is that it doesn&#x27;t stay in the perfect position so I find myself adjusting it or removing it. The straps bother my ears to the point of pain. If I position the straps above and behind it feels like the crease where my ears meet my scalp is on fire. If I position the straps over my ears, my ears again burn. I&#x27;m not sure what the strap is made of and I do have an allergy to latex so that may be my problem. I have not been able to keep this on throughout the night. With all that said, it is the best mask I&#x27;ve ever tried so I will keep trying to get used to it.  I sleep with ear plugs nightly - the best thing about these is the case they come in. They seem to be a bit small and I still hear my spouse snoring.</li>
            <li> Wonderfully comfortable, and fits well on my narrow nose bridge to completely block out light.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Good product &amp; quick delivery</li>
            <li> I live in a very street-light lit area. Even with black-out curtains I have trouble falling asleep. One thing I&#x27;ve noticed that really helps are sleeping masks. With that being said, I&#x27;ve tried quite a few and I haven&#x27;t found one that completely blocked out the light or was comfortable to wear. This mask is different, and possibly one of the best I&#x27;ve ever worn to bed. I purchased a homemade one on Etsy that is still my favorite (because I like the owl print on it), but this one is half the price and just as good in quality- which is why I&#x27;m rating it 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed about this sleeping mask was the thickness. No light is going to get through this mask! It seems a little bulky at first- especially if you&#x27;re used to the thin silk masks that are commonly sold. With that being said, once you get used to wearing something like this you&#x27;ll notice a significant difference in the amount of light that gets through. It truly does create a blacked out environment that is really nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mask fit my head perfectly. I have pretty average head size, so I think I can fairly say that this mask can be adjusted to fit anyone. The mask can be adjusted with little sliding adjusters and then has a clasp in the back that secures the mask around your head. The company boasts that the clasp won&#x27;t snag in hair- and I have very snaggly fine hair. So far it hasn&#x27;t gotten tangled in my hair, although sometimes I do accidently clasp a few strands of hair into the clip and it pulls them out when I roll around. I just put my hair in a low pony tail to avoid that problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing that I really love about this mask is that it&#x27;s contoured to fit around the bridge of your nose. Most sleeping masks don&#x27;t adequate fit around your nose so have small gaps where light can get through. That is not the case with this mask. Because it fits snug around all of the curves of your face- literally no light gets through. That is something that my Etsy eye mask did not have, and it is a feature that a I REALLY appreciated on this specific mask. I have a Jewish nose (a big nose) and it fits well over it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I do really like this mask. The clasp sometimes clips onto your hair (but that&#x27;s my own fault for not being more careful), but other than that it&#x27;s a great product. Very quality sewn and made with good materials. It has a very pretty leafy design (I got the Emerald Forest print) and fits well to my face. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this mask for anyone looking for a sleep aid. It&#x27;d make a great gift too, and comes in a very pretty box!k did not have, and it is a feature that a I REALLY appreciated on this specific mask.

            <li> I bought this sleep mask for the buckle closure, which doesn&#x27;t snag my hair like the Velcro on the other sleep mask. Velcro or no, these masks are a Godsend! Having unnecessary sources of light flooding my bedroom (7 windows(!), a spotlight-like set top box display, a street light right outside my bedroom window, a neighbor who seems to think my bedroom windows need to be decoratively lit by his outdoor lighting, etc.), these sleep masks do exactly what I need: keep the light out. I&#x27;m usually up early on the weekends due to the sunlight reflecting off my mirrored closet doors and shining in my face but now, using the sleep mask, I sometimes sleep until 9 or later. When I remove the mask, I&#x27;m always surprised at how bright it is. I would buy this mask time and again as needed and would definitely recommend it to others. I can&#x27;t, however, speak on the ear plugs as I use others with a higher dB rating.</li>
            <li> I love this sleep mask. The clasp adjustment on the strap is nice, doesn&#x27;t get stuck in my hair. The contoured face is very comfortable, no pressure spots. I&#x27;m a nurse and I  wear it to sleep during the day after my overnight shift. It really helps. The earplugs we comfortable and the carrying case is nice too.</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best sleep mask I&#x27;ve ever used.  It blocks light completely, and as a migraineur that is very important when I&#x27;m suffering as even the littlest bits of lights are painful.  I was also please with the non-Velcro closure, there is no hair pulling with this mask.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for a quality sleep mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 10/30/15:  I had to order a replacement after about 6 months. the layers around the nose start to separate and the mask looses it&#x27;s total blackout ability.  But considering how much I use this mask (sometimes up to 18 hours in a day) I&#x27;d still recommend it and have stocked up so I have a supply for a while.</li>
            <li> The eye mask is comfortable and I have been able to sleep wearing the mask.</li>
            <li> You would think with the contour for your nose that it would fit snuggly and block out most of the light. For me this sleep mask is okay, at best. it shifts extremely easily and I find myself with no coverage on one eye or the other. I thought that I would like the concave eye area, but I find myself just staring into the mask. I don&#x27;t think I would recommend it to anyone, but it somewhat does it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li> This product is great for sleep</li>
            <li> I was worried that a sleep mask would feel strange, but this is so comfortable, I don&#x27;t even notice it&#x27;s on. I&#x27;ve slept much better the past few nights since receiving the item. Having a buckle closure instead of velcro is fantastic because 1) it doesn&#x27;t get stuck in my hair and 2) it&#x27;s adjustable (won&#x27;t stretch out and become unusable without altering like a straight elastic band). The cure pattern (with black fabric inside, blocking out all light) helps me like this product, too! I have no issues with it pinching/constricting my nose or any tightness on my cheeks. I can sleep on any side I want!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my daughter, she works overnights at the hospital.&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;Mum this is the best gift thank you&#x27; I was told that this mask is perfect because it doesn&#x27;t sit right on the eyes, (apparently your eyes can dry out of pressed on by sleeping masks) but this mask has little cups almost so you can blink and your lashes aren&#x27;t squished.  They are total black out, soft and non- drying to the eyes. (Plus you get free earplugs tooüòä)&lt;br /&gt;Definite win - thanks for a great product üëçüèº</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews but I will for this. I live in the city and need pitch black to sleep. I also have insomnia problems and take sleeping pills to get a decent night sleep. Since using this sleeping mask I have not taken one sleeping pill and have gotten numerous nights of good sleep. Sometimes so good that I actually wake up tired. These conform perfectly to your face, they are super comfy and you can open your eyes in them which I think helps make you believe it&#x27;s still dark out to go back to sleep. I would suggest these to everyone, I actually bought a second pair for a friend and she loves them.</li>
            <li> Update after two months: So disappointed!! I just washed the eye mask and the fabric on the front and back has completely come off. Such a waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original post: Great eye mask. I like that it doesn&#x27;t rest directly on my eyes, so my eyes can move freely as I sleep. The bridge of the nose isn&#x27;t quite as big as another mask I have, but I am getting used to it. I really appreciate that it has a buckle instead of Velcro, which always caught on my hair. Overall, it is comfortable.</li>
            <li> This product came exactly as shown and described. It&#x27;s very comfortable and stays on while asleep very well. I work night shift, and this is a perfect solution to sleeping during the day! The mask blocks out all the light.</li>
            <li> I have tried out a few different sleep masks over the years and this is one of the ones that I have liked the most. I love how the mask is contoured and not just a flat piece of fabric. As you can see in the picture provided with the listing there is an area for your nose and also the areas for your eyes are raised so that the fabric is not touching your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mask is nice and dark and fit both myself and my wife well so I would guess that it would fit more adults without a problem. The strap has a little buckle on at the back and is easy to adjust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The earplugs are a nice touch if you&#x27;re buying this set to travel you never know what you&#x27;ll have to endure from noisy neighbors in the room next door or partying in the streets below. There are two pair included here and they are a very basic foam type of earplug but they&#x27;ll do the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a really nice set,for both men and women, that is perfect for traveling or just when you need to get some sleep during the daytime. Recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for review.</li>
            <li> As promised: my eyelashes don&#x27;t touch and my hair is not snagged by the buckle.  There&#x27;s a tiny sliver of light that shows around the edge of the mask in a bright room, but in a dim place it is imperceptible.  All in all, a very comfortable mask for me.</li>
            <li> Love it!!!  Completely blocks any light and very comfortable.</li>
            <li> bought for my wife - she loves them - works second shift and they help her sleep in the morning !</li>
            <li> I love this mask! it really blocks out the light as well as the fabric not smooshing up against your eyelids! Straps are adjustable as well.  Totally worth the money</li>
            <li> I purchased the eye shades to shield my eyes from the air from my husbands sleep apnea appliance.  This works great.  It shields the wind and the light when he reads before bed.  I have a small head so its cinched as small as possible.  I like that it doesn&#x27;t sit on my eyes - that would be annoying. It also doesn&#x27;t snag my hair or feel too tight.</li>
            <li> This mask is amazing! I just ordered another one! For the price it is a great value. I like the way it fits on a woman&#x27;s smaller face.</li>
            <li> I sleep with an eye mask on every night and the main thing that I like about this mask is that it does not have Velcro.  I have long hair and Velcro is a mess to get things tangled.  The mask fits very nicely and does not let in any light.  It is a little stiff for sleeping on your side. It tends to pop up a little.  Doesn&#x27;t bother me because I sleep on my back.  Be careful when ordering because there are two that look almost identical, one is several dollars less but that one has the Velcro.  Yes-I intend to order another for my travel kit.</li>
            <li> I love this mask! I ordered the Nidra  sleep  mask several months ago.  I was glad that it did provide full blockage from light.  But,  it was  velcro closure.  I had it as tight as I could possibly close it and it still slipped off my head because the elastic had quickly stretched out.  The adjustable clasp with this one is much more secure on my head but not at all uncomfortable.  The nose coverage area is also smaller but that actually works way better for my face shape and nose.  I have not used the ear plugs.  I feel like I have tiny ears or something because even the tiniest Warburg are painful for me.  I will not be using those.  For the cost,  the comfort and clasp of this mask,  you are definitely getting a quality product.  I ordered the green one first.  I would like to order another one soon just to have an alternative.  I seem to be very sensitive to light when sleeping.  Even the little dot on my phone charging is  distracting.  This really helps me to refocus on trying to get to sleep if I pop my eyes open and it&#x27;s pitch black.  The molded cups are fantastic and do not prevent me from opening my eyes.  Love this mask!</li>
            <li> Rough fabric, not light tight. Only pro is the clip closure doesn&#x27;t snag my hair, will most likely remover strap &amp; attach to a better mask.</li>
            <li> This worked great. Totally blocks out the light from my husband watching tv after I go to sleep. I haven&#x27;t tried the ear plugs, but the mask does exactly what I needed. The no snag closure is nice too along with the way the mask has space so it is not resting directly on your eyes.</li>
            <li> I used these Saturday on a 13 hour flight from Auckland, New Zealand and I slept so well on the plane ( I never am able to sleep on planes). No jet lag later. I was in a deep sleep because of this sleeping mask. The doesn&#x27;t mess up your hair, nor does it bother your eye lids when sleeping. The only downside is that some light comes through near the nose area but just adjust it and it&#x27;s pitch black. I would definitely recommend this sleep mask.</li>
            <li> Cute pattern and I like the adjustable strap. The frame is alittle big for my small face.. And because of that alittle light shines through around the nose. I was hoping for complete darkness as I am a nurse who works night shift and must sleep through the days.. Still happy with my purchase however. Just would like option of a smaller frame.</li>
            <li> Love this mask!!! I have only had it for a bit but compared to other masks I&#x27;ve had it doesn&#x27;t stretch easy. Also does completely block out the light which I love because I&#x27;m very sensitive to light also I can open my eyes while wearing the mask which is cool :). Super cute design &amp; amazing product!</li>
            <li> Luv how it fits over your nose to keep even more light out!</li>
            <li> all the light is blocked, and easy to adjust and is so comfy</li>
            <li> This eye mask is very comfortable. I enjoy the fact that it is molded rather than filled with stuffing as with many eye masks (or just flat fabric as with really cheap eye masks). The headband is comfortable for side sleeping which can be a problem with bands with bulkier buckles. It does have a tendency to slip off my hair in the night after I am asleep, and it is not completely light-tight around the bridge of my nose, but those aren&#x27;t deal breakers for me. .</li>
            <li> My daughter loves the eye mask. She has a concussion and has to rest and not use her eyes. She struggled with a regular mask. She thinks this one is beautiful and fits very well. She especially likes the buckle strap that is so easy to adjust.</li>
            <li> Works just as advertised. Blocks light like it is supposed to, does not crush eyelashes. I would buy this again in the future.</li>
            <li> I liked these but forgot them on the plane! But I usually buy these from TJMaxx for much cheaper but the ones I got here were a nice buy.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable. Contours to the face well to not let any light in around the nose area.</li>
            <li> I am in college and sleeping in the dorm which can sometimes be difficult. This sleep mask is perfect and I really love the lavender earplugs that help block the noise coming from the hall and from my roommate‚Äôs often annoying headphones- she has them on loud.  It‚Äôs also a great way to get a natural drug free sleep so I am rested for the next day</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product - I get up really early and am lucky enough that I have time to take a nap during my lunch break at work. With the mask and earplugs, I shut my office door and am able to get a fantastic power nap. Totally cool product!</li>
            <li> This one seems better than others I have tried recently, mostly since it doesn&#x27;t have velcro. I usually figure out some way to make these more comfy by replacing the elastic with something smoother, but I&#x27;m glad that it isn&#x27;t so sharp and isn&#x27;t grabbing onto my hair. It&#x27;s stiffer than I like, but not as stiff as another one that I tried. The nose is also staying in place a little better and it is not plugging my nose like another one did.</li>
            <li> Very uncomfortable to wear. I dee, soft terry masks are more comfortable</li>
            <li> I LOVE this mask!  I have tried a few others and just have not been satisfied.  I was blessed with long lashes which makes it difficult to find sunglasses as well as sleep masks which do not rub against my eyelashes....it is like fingernails on a chalkboard for me when this happens.  The sleep mask has an ample amount of room over my eyes so that my lashes don&#x27;t get crimped during sleep, as well as not brushing if I blink.  I also get headaches easily from side pressure on my temples which I have pleasantly not had any issue with while using this mask. It stays put well even when worn loosely.  I am beyond pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This mask keeps the light out and is comfortable. I enjoy the freedom of being able to move my eyelids. Thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a variety of sleep mask over the years, this one is by far the best!  Being molded, it allows me to open my eyes and doesn&#x27;t inhibit REM.  It blocks virtually all light.  It stays in place, comfortably.  And I love that it doesn&#x27;t have a hook and loop fastener.  I hook and loop on a sleep mask, it always catches and pulls my hair.  I wake up refreshed.  It&#x27;s as though I&#x27;m not wearing a mask.</li>
