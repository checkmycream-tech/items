            <li>:)   </li>

            <li>Just what I was looking for.:)</li>
            <li>I love the size but they rend to leak if they are knocked over or carried in a bag.</li>
            <li>All glass, thus heavier than plastic, yet with a plastic spray top and cap.  </li>

            <li>Will be ordering more.</li>

            <li>Perfect for mixing my oils for different things</li>

            <li>They create a nice full and fine mist.  </li>
            <li>This seller has good, fast communication.</li>
            <li>Just the right size and a nice mist.</li>
            <li>these lids come off soooo easily.  </li>
            <li>They haven&#x27;t clogged up, easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Beautiful blue glass spray bottles.  </li>
            <li>These are pretty nice bottles.  </li>
            <li>The blue is beautiful.</li>
            <li>Sprays a fine, even, mist.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and all in one piece!</li>
            <li>These are high quality &amp; I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>These work great for my DIY products I make with essential oils.</li>
            <li>Great for essential oils.  </li>
            <li>They are a beautiful blue color, are high quality and very easy to use.</li>
            <li>I use them to spray an essential oil/water combo and it mists very nicely.  </li>
            <li>so I haven&#x27;t gotten to use them too much, but so far they are great.</li>
            <li>How is that even possible?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried all the lids that came with the bottles, tried for a secure fit, throroughly dried the threads before screwing the top on and only held them perfectly upright when using and they still leak onto my hands.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping.</li>
            <li>Have made up several Essential Oil recipes and contained them in these perfectly sized bottles.</li>
            <li>Very pretty on my vanity and desk.  </li>
            <li>Bought these to make some essential oil air fresheners and they are cute and work well!</li>
            <li>They are pretty too!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m busy filling them up! :-)  </li>
            <li>these sprayers now fit very well.</li>
            <li>I called the manufacturer directly and they promised one more sprayer to arrive in the mail soon.</li>
            <li>None were broken in the box and they all were in perfect shape.</li>
            <li>Super fast and clean and arrived in 24hours.</li>
            <li>the other 4 seem to fit nice and snug.  </li>
            <li>The spray is definitely a clean mist and that&#x27;s why I bought them as many spray facial products, etc.</li>
            <li>These little spray bottles work great and are exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>Still, these were a good deal and its not worth the hassle or paying shipping to exchange.&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li>If I make sure the threads on the glass and sprayer are clean and dry before I tighten them</li>
            <li>The mist is very fine but with a nice amount of dispersal and the sprayer pump hasn&#x27;t jammed or stopped up as is so often the case with various spray pumps.  </li>
            <li>Make sure to check each spritzer though, two of mine didn&#x27;t work and one actually fell apart.</li>
            <li>but the spray is consistent.</li>
            <li>and I really need the spray bottles!</li>
            <li>I have enjoyed using these bottles with my essential oils.</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li>Will definitely order more.</li>
            <li>There is perhaps a very slight delay in the pump action if you&#x27;re really going at it, but it works great after one bottle&#x27;s worth being dispersed.  </li>
            <li>the seller was very quick in replies while trying to resolve the issue and is taking steps to make sure the proper sprayers are sent with the proper size bottles in each order.  </li>
            <li>One of my very close friends told me the pump on hers did not work.</li>
            <li>All did arrive whole and work the way I anticipated.</li>
            <li>Found one that really sprays well.</li>
            <li>I contacted the seller, and they responded that these are the only tops available.</li>
            <li>As advertised and delivered in a very timely fashion.</li>
            <li>Nice dark blue color if the product is light sensitive.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m willing to pay a little bit more for aesthetic reasons.</li>
            <li>Rather its cool whip white, opaque.</li>
            <li>I made homemade organic fragrance in one (sweet orange essential oil in vanilla!)</li>
            <li>All mine came with a black spray top.</li>
            <li>Good size, good pump action, so much less expensive than stores.</li>
            <li>I love Tito try out different essential oils recipes.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product for the quality of the glass itself...</li>
            <li>I love the look of the bottles, however they arrived missing one sprayer.</li>
            <li>Every time I pick up the bottle, a few drops of the contents leak out from under the screw top part....</li>
            <li>the proper fitting sprayers have the extra bevel in the white plastic sprayer part.  </li>
            <li>Pretty, glass bottle, but the white nozzle tops are not leak proof.</li>
            <li>As expected and quick delivery</li>
            <li>B0070AZJ5O 2 oz Amber Boston Round Glass Bottle with Fine Mist sprayer 6/bx]].)</li>
            <li>They seem to fit tightly, yet when I gently shake them to mix my essential oils, they leak.</li>
            <li>Love my little blue glass spray bottles!</li>
            <li>I like these and the sprayer has worked well so far, but it leaks a bit.</li>
            <li>I also spray kids and dogs with these and the mist is so soft it doesn&#x27;t scare them.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and I will purchase from this seller in the future.</li>
            <li>I have used 4 of the 6 and have no issues so far.  </li>
            <li>I really like these blue spray bottles for my aromatherapy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is one thing worth mentioning: They don&#x27;t actually come with the pearly white sprayer as pictured.</li>
            <li>I wish the pictures were accurate as I actually prefer the black tops to what I got.</li>
            <li>They promptly returned my call (about an hour later), apologized for the inconvenience and will be mailing me about three or four new spritzers.</li>
            <li>They are a very pretty blue and mine came with black spritzers.</li>
            <li>the other 4 caps tightened very well.  </li>
            <li>i have since used these sprayers and had them in my purse in a ziploc bag (just in case) and not a single drop has leaked out.  </li>
            <li>These are very high quality glass bottles which came with black spray tops.  </li>
            <li>They are a pretty blue color (a little lighter than in the picture), and they are solid glass.</li>
            <li>These are not good quality, the first one I bought worked fine for about a month the other 3 i tried one worked a day and when I swapped it out with the other sprayer it sprayed one pump</li>

            <li> I called the manufacturer directly and they promised one more sprayer to arrive in the mail soon.</li>
            <li> None were broken in the box and they all were in perfect shape.</li>
            <li> Super fast and clean and arrived in 24hours.</li>
            <li> the other 4 seem to fit nice and snug.  </li>
            <li> The spray is definitely a clean mist and that&#x27;s why I bought them as many spray facial products, etc.</li>
            <li> These little spray bottles work great and are exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> Still, these were a good deal and its not worth the hassle or paying shipping to exchange.&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li> If I make sure the threads on the glass and sprayer are clean and dry before I tighten them</li>
            <li> The mist is very fine but with a nice amount of dispersal and the sprayer pump hasn&#x27;t jammed or stopped up as is so often the case with various spray pumps.  </li>
            <li> Make sure to check each spritzer though, two of mine didn&#x27;t work and one actually fell apart.</li>
            <li> but the spray is consistent.</li>
            <li> and I really need the spray bottles!</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed using these bottles with my essential oils.</li>
            <li> I will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li> Will definitely order more.</li>
            <li> There is perhaps a very slight delay in the pump action if you&#x27;re really going at it, but it works great after one bottle&#x27;s worth being dispersed.  </li>
            <li> the seller was very quick in replies while trying to resolve the issue and is taking steps to make sure the proper sprayers are sent with the proper size bottles in each order.  </li>
            <li> One of my very close friends told me the pump on hers did not work.</li>
            <li> All did arrive whole and work the way I anticipated.</li>
            <li> Found one that really sprays well.</li>
            <li> I contacted the seller, and they responded that these are the only tops available.</li>
            <li> As advertised and delivered in a very timely fashion.</li>
            <li> Nice dark blue color if the product is light sensitive.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m willing to pay a little bit more for aesthetic reasons.</li>
            <li> Rather its cool whip white, opaque.</li>
            <li> I made homemade organic fragrance in one (sweet orange essential oil in vanilla!)</li>
            <li> All mine came with a black spray top.</li>
            <li> Good size, good pump action, so much less expensive than stores.</li>
            <li> I love Tito try out different essential oils recipes.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product for the quality of the glass itself...</li>
            <li> I love the look of the bottles, however they arrived missing one sprayer.</li>
            <li> Every time I pick up the bottle, a few drops of the contents leak out from under the screw top part....</li>
            <li> the proper fitting sprayers have the extra bevel in the white plastic sprayer part.  </li>
            <li> Pretty, glass bottle, but the white nozzle tops are not leak proof.</li>
            <li> As expected and quick delivery</li>
            <li> B0070AZJ5O 2 oz Amber Boston Round Glass Bottle with Fine Mist sprayer 6/bx]].)</li>
            <li> They seem to fit tightly, yet when I gently shake them to mix my essential oils, they leak.</li>
            <li> Love my little blue glass spray bottles!</li>
            <li> I like these and the sprayer has worked well so far, but it leaks a bit.</li>
            <li> I also spray kids and dogs with these and the mist is so soft it doesn&#x27;t scare them.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and I will purchase from this seller in the future.</li>
            <li> I have used 4 of the 6 and have no issues so far.  </li>
            <li> I really like these blue spray bottles for my aromatherapy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is one thing worth mentioning: They don&#x27;t actually come with the pearly white sprayer as pictured.</li>
            <li> I wish the pictures were accurate as I actually prefer the black tops to what I got.</li>
            <li> They promptly returned my call (about an hour later), apologized for the inconvenience and will be mailing me about three or four new spritzers.</li>
            <li> They are a very pretty blue and mine came with black spritzers.</li>
            <li> the other 4 caps tightened very well.  </li>
            <li> i have since used these sprayers and had them in my purse in a ziploc bag (just in case) and not a single drop has leaked out.  </li>
            <li> These are very high quality glass bottles which came with black spray tops.  </li>
            <li> They are a pretty blue color (a little lighter than in the picture), and they are solid glass.</li>
            <li> These are not good quality, the first one I bought worked fine for about a month the other 3 i tried one worked a day and when I swapped it out with the other sprayer it sprayed one pump</li>
            <li> i will update you on how long they last.</li>
            <li> The photo clearly shows the hose down to the bottom of the bottle.</li>
            <li> The smaller size (than commercial products you buy) allow for travel without the fuss of overloading a bag and small enough to have it in the &amp;#34;see threw&amp;#34; plastic carry on container for airport security.  </li>
            <li> With the price on this, it was just not worth my time to send back.</li>
            <li> These came loosely packed and rolling a bit in their box.  </li>
            <li> arrived on time and was as expected</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that the sprayer has started to become wet while I&#x27;m spraying.</li>
            <li> This is embarrassing since I don&#x27;t know the recipients of the other bottles as well</li>
            <li> Dark glass protects the oils.</li>
            <li> (I end up with a ahndful of the product I was spraying) or the don&#x27;t spray at all and just dribble down the side.</li>
            <li> I like that the seller allows you to email and request the color of spray pump you want (white or black) -- a small thing, but I like the black and got it!!</li>
            <li> They are a tough, blue, glass.  </li>
            <li> The sprayers do not fit as well as I would like them to.</li>
            <li> Although I never got round to making my mosquito spray, I did make an orange/lavender oil mist that freshened up musty odors.  </li>
            <li> I just received this in the mail a few days ago</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure that liquid will stay put if brought on travel or carried in a purse.</li>
            <li> There is a small amount of leakage.</li>
            <li> Makes it hard to use the mist bottle that way.</li>
            <li> Common sense reminds us all to put these in zip locks and wedge in upright pocket of purse to assure the won&#x27;t tip.  </li>
            <li> Horribly disappointed in the length of the spray hose, it only reaches 1/2 way down the bottle.</li>
            <li> Not great for travel</li>
            <li> arrived on time but one was broken</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t get around to using them quickly enough to be eligible for a return :(</li>
            <li> Unhappy since I was planning on traveling with at least one spray bottle.  </li>
            <li> I purchased these bottles to make bug repellent tinctures with essential oils.  </li>
            <li> The stoppers get stuck on the down stroke as they hit the edge of the base.  </li>
            <li> They failed to work afterwards/leaked and the tubes fell off.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe that all of them are useless....</li>
            <li> You can get them to work, but it is too awkward to give as a gift as I planned.</li>
            <li> i was very disappointed to find out that no matter how hard i try to tighten the sprayer on the bottle, it never gets snug.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very frustrating!</li>
            <li> I had bad luck with these bottles.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t sterilize :(</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed</li>
            <li> but when I shook the bottle to mix my oils they leaked. :(</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Awful lids.</li>
            <li> The lids are terrible.</li>
            <li> They either leak terribly when you spray them</li>

    <ol>
            <li> They were great! So happy with them!</li>
            <li> Awesome bottles!!! They are a very pretty blue and mine came with black spritzers. The mist is better than I thought it would be. Make sure to check each spritzer though, two of mine didn&#x27;t work and one actually fell apart. No worries though, I contacted the seller and left them a message. They promptly returned my call (about an hour later), apologized for the inconvenience and will be mailing me about three or four new spritzers. She was very polite and kind, very happy with their product and service.  :)   And to make sure they get the credit I bought the bottles from  GlassBottleOutlet by Never Pay Retail Again, Inc.</li>
            <li> arrived on time and was as expected</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for.:)</li>
            <li> I boiled them separated for 5-10 mins to sterilize them. They failed to work afterwards/leaked and the tubes fell off. Disappointed. The glass bottle portion are nice and thick/durable. Don&#x27;t sterilize :(</li>
            <li> These are very nice bottles. I&#x27;m using them to make sprays with essential oils.</li>
            <li> These glass spray bottles are great and work without a lot of effort and skips.</li>
            <li> I love the size but they rend to leak if they are knocked over or carried in a bag. Not great for travel but the spray is consistent.</li>
            <li> perfect  for my hand sanitizer love it</li>
            <li> I bought these to make homemade hand santizer for Christmas gifts.  One of my very close friends told me the pump on hers did not work. This is embarrassing since I don&#x27;t know the recipients of the other bottles as well (staff at my son&#x27;s daycare).  I&#x27;m just hoping their pumps were not defective either.</li>
            <li> These are very high quality glass bottles which came with black spray tops.  6 for this price is amazingly excellent.  I am using these for my liquid silver and rosewater so that I can have smaller dispensers to take in purse.  Common sense reminds us all to put these in zip locks and wedge in upright pocket of purse to assure the won&#x27;t tip.  These are great.</li>
            <li> I bought these for use with dōTerra essential oils: pet spray, mosquito spray, linen spray-and hoped the plastic held up to the sometimes solvent effects they have on some petroleum products... So far, so good!</li>
            <li> All glass, thus heavier than plastic, yet with a plastic spray top and cap.  The spray is definitely a clean mist and that&#x27;s why I bought them as many spray facial products, etc. don&#x27;t spray a mist, they just say they do.  The smaller size (than commercial products you buy) allow for travel without the fuss of overloading a bag and small enough to have it in the &amp;#34;see threw&amp;#34; plastic carry on container for airport security.  This allows you to travel with just a carry on if needed.  Nice dark blue color if the product is light sensitive.  Just a bit heavier than an all plastic container, yet easily more durable.</li>
            <li> Using for EO suspensions - easy to work with, great sprayers / misters. I use this in the car, my purse, in my son&#x27;s room, the bathroom...I will order more soon!</li>
            <li> These work great for my DIY products I make with essential oils.</li>
            <li> Love these bottles. They are a beautiful blue color, are high quality and very easy to use. The price was great!</li>
            <li> Perfect for my essential oil mixtures!</li>
            <li> Quick shipping. Great price and the blue bottles functions perfectly.</li>
            <li> Bought these to make some essential oil air fresheners and they are cute and work well! Perfect.</li>
            <li> Love these bottles and they don&#x27;t leak!  UPDATE.....none of the bottles are working.......I use filtered water and 20 drops of essential oils.  I can&#x27;t believe that all of them are useless....I am so disappointed and I really need the spray bottles!</li>
            <li> Like these very much!!!!  They don&#x27;t leak, very good quality. Will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> Perfect for what I&#x27;m using them for!</li>
            <li> These came loosely packed and rolling a bit in their box.  All did arrive whole and work the way I anticipated.</li>
            <li> These are not good quality, the first one I bought worked fine for about a month the other 3 i tried one worked a day and when I swapped it out with the other sprayer it sprayed one pump and it was done.  I had a water based product with a couple drops of essential oils.  would not prder these again EVER.</li>
            <li> Great sprayer! I have to tighten the top frequently but otherwise good quality! I keep it in my purse and it doesn&#x27;t leak.</li>
            <li> I like these and the sprayer has worked well so far, but it leaks a bit.</li>
            <li> Does what you buy it for.</li>
            <li> Glass part was nice, except the tops are cheap and does not lock on the way they should. I&#x27;m not sure that liquid will stay put if brought on travel or carried in a purse. With the price on this, it was just not worth my time to send back.</li>
            <li> Bottle is great. I&#x27;ve noticed that the sprayer has started to become wet while I&#x27;m spraying. Not just the nozzle, but the entire push mechanism.</li>
            <li> Love my little blue glass spray bottles! They are just perfect for making bug spray, perfume, etc. for my essential oil business.</li>
            <li> i was very disappointed to find out that no matter how hard i try to tighten the sprayer on the bottle, it never gets snug.  these lids come off soooo easily.  im going to try to find another use or try a sprayer from another bottle maybe.  but as they are, there&#x27;s no way i can trust them in my purse.  whatever you put in them, the bottle will have to sit on the shelf upright and always check the lid before you use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;update: after speaking with the seller, i noticed that the sprayers on 2 of the 6 bottles are different and those are the only two that won&#x27;t tighten properly (see pic).  the other 4 seem to fit nice and snug.  the proper fitting sprayers have the extra bevel in the white plastic sprayer part.  i&#x27;ll update again when the issue is resolved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***update***&lt;br /&gt;after contacting the seller, we discovered 2 out of the 6 sprayers had different style caps.  the other 4 caps tightened very well.  the seller sent me 2 of the same style as the 4 that worked.  i have since used these sprayers and had them in my purse in a ziploc bag (just in case) and not a single drop has leaked out.  these sprayers now fit very well. the seller was very quick in replies while trying to resolve the issue and is taking steps to make sure the proper sprayers are sent with the proper size bottles in each order.  i will update you on how long they last.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my natural air sprays!  Lavender for at night!</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed using these bottles with my essential oils. They spray a fine mist that is perfect for your face and neck. I also spray kids and dogs with these and the mist is so soft it doesn&#x27;t scare them. Shipping was fast and I will purchase from this seller in the future.</li>
            <li> We purchased these for spraying oils onto skin. Works as advertized, no complaints. They haven&#x27;t clogged up, easy to use.</li>
            <li> I purchased these bottles to make bug repellent tinctures with essential oils.  They were perfect, and I give them to friends and family . The tinctures are amazingly effective, and  attractive in these cobalt bottles.</li>
            <li> Used a couple and leaking after a short time.</li>
            <li> I love the look of the bottles, however they arrived missing one sprayer. The sprayers do not fit as well as I would like them to. There is a small amount of leakage. I called the manufacturer directly and they promised one more sprayer to arrive in the mail soon.</li>
            <li> Only reason for 3 instead of 5 is two of my sprayers don&#x27;t work. Makes it hard to use the mist bottle that way.</li>
            <li> Horribly disappointed in the length of the spray hose, it only reaches 1/2 way down the bottle. I am upset. The photo clearly shows the hose down to the bottom of the bottle. These were also packaged poorly...had tape around each bottle, now every bottle has a sticky residue that I will have to remove. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I got these for spritzing various essential oil concoctions.  Although I never got round to making my mosquito spray, I did make an orange/lavender oil mist that freshened up musty odors.  The mist is very fine but with a nice amount of dispersal and the sprayer pump hasn&#x27;t jammed or stopped up as is so often the case with various spray pumps.  There is perhaps a very slight delay in the pump action if you&#x27;re really going at it, but it works great after one bottle&#x27;s worth being dispersed.  I like that the seller allows you to email and request the color of spray pump you want (white or black) -- a small thing, but I like the black and got it!!</li>
            <li> Beautiful blue glass spray bottles.  I purchased to use them for homemade hand sanitizer and toner.  Very pretty on my vanity and desk.  Sprays a fine, even, mist.</li>
            <li> All done extrelmely well. Good product, nicely packaged, and promptly shipped.</li>
            <li> Beautiful bottles!  I use them to make body or face sprays with oils.  Will be ordering more for sure!</li>
            <li> Good price but the tops leak.  Not an issue if you are keeping them at home but when I shook the bottle to mix my oils they leaked. :( Unhappy since I was planning on traveling with at least one spray bottle.  If the tops didn&#x27;t leak I would happy change to 5 starts.</li>
            <li> Pusher on a couple of them stick.</li>
            <li> As expected and quick delivery</li>
            <li> These are pretty nice bottles.  They are a tough, blue, glass.  I have used 4 of the 6 and have no issues so far.  I use them to spray an essential oil/water combo and it mists very nicely.  They create a nice full and fine mist.  I will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li> This seller has good, fast communication. I emailed requesting the &amp;#34;pearlescent white&amp;#34; tops and they got back to me within hours. I would buy from them again. The mist sprayers are high quality and a great value when compared to others listed on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is one thing worth mentioning: They don&#x27;t actually come with the pearly white sprayer as pictured. Rather its cool whip white, opaque. I&#x27;m willing to pay a little bit more for aesthetic reasons. (Otherwise I would have gone with the cheaper [[ASIN:B0070AZJ5O 2 oz Amber Boston Round Glass Bottle with Fine Mist sprayer 6/bx]].) I wish the pictures were accurate as I actually prefer the black tops to what I got. Still, these were a good deal and its not worth the hassle or paying shipping to exchange.&lt;br /&gt;Edit: I&#x27;m still using these bottles - they work great. If I make sure the threads on the glass and sprayer are clean and dry before I tighten them I have no problems with leaking. Hope this helps someone out there.</li>
            <li> Good size, good pump action, so much less expensive than stores.</li>
            <li> These bottles leak when transported on their side.  When not on their side the mister sometimes does not work.  I am ordering from another seller in hopes of better bottles.</li>
            <li> Yes!  Found one that really sprays well. Will reorder these soon.</li>
            <li> These glass bottles were packed well and all arrived safely.  The bottles work great and I am very pleased with them.  Will definitely order more.</li>
            <li> Awful lids. The glass bottles themselves are beautiful and seem to be well crafted. The lids are terrible. All mine came with a black spray top. They mist perfectly, but the tops leak. Every time I pick up the bottle, a few drops of the contents leak out from under the screw top part....even holding the bottle upright. How is that even possible?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried all the lids that came with the bottles, tried for a secure fit, throroughly dried the threads before screwing the top on and only held them perfectly upright when using and they still leak onto my hands. It seems as if the lids contain no gasket to prevent leakage. It&#x27;s very frustrating!</li>
            <li> I really like these blue spray bottles for my aromatherapy. Just the right size and a nice mist. They are pretty too!</li>
            <li> arrived on time but one was broken</li>
            <li> These little spray bottles work great and are exactly what I wanted.  Very happy!</li>
            <li> these are really handy to have around and functional. not dissapointed</li>
            <li> Very nice! Easy to use. Will reorder.</li>
            <li> I just received this in the mail a few days ago so I haven&#x27;t gotten to use them too much, but so far they are great. I was very impressed with the packaging. They were labeled \\&quot;fragile liquid-- handle with care\\&quot; and they were wrapped over and over again in bubble wrap. They are a pretty blue color (a little lighter than in the picture), and they are solid glass. They are quite substantial for the price i paid for them-- I wasn&#x27;t expecting them to be that kind of quality. None were broken in the box and they all were in perfect shape. I would highly recommend this product for the quality of the glass itself... the plastic spray nozzles are just a bonus.</li>
            <li> Perfect for mixing my oils for different things</li>
            <li> Pretty, glass bottle, but the white nozzle tops are not leak proof. They seem to fit tightly, yet when I gently shake them to mix my essential oils, they leak. My tops have two notches in the top. I contacted the seller, and they responded that these are the only tops available. I am going to keep them, but they are not for travel.</li>
            <li> The stoppers get stuck on the down stroke as they hit the edge of the base.  You can get them to work, but it is too awkward to give as a gift as I planned.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and all in one piece!</li>
            <li> Super fast and clean and arrived in 24hours. What more could I want.</li>
            <li> Great for mixing my own room fresheners.</li>
            <li> Great for essential oils.  Nice spray.</li>
            <li> These are fabulous bottles! I made homemade organic fragrance in one (sweet orange essential oil in vanilla!) and they all spray so beautifully!  I&#x27;m busy filling them up! :-)  They spray so nicely and are pretty!  Smooth easy transaction!  Gotta love that!</li>
            <li> Perfect for mixing oils for room refreshener</li>
            <li> Very Happy.  I&#x27;m buying more.</li>
            <li> These are high quality &amp; I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> Sprays nice, but leaks from around the pumping mechanism.</li>
            <li> Perfect bottles for use with my essential oils!! Packaged well too.</li>
            <li> perfect for mixing and using essential oils for cleaning or skin care</li>
            <li> Perfect size. I love Tito try out different essential oils recipes.  This gives me a way to try lots without using a ton of oil. The blue is beautiful. Dark glass protects the oils. Did I mention it is the perfect size?</li>
            <li> I have had no troubles with this item.</li>
            <li> As advertised and delivered in a very timely fashion.</li>
            <li> Have made up several Essential Oil recipes and contained them in these perfectly sized bottles. they perform perfectly and are pocket size for easy carry alongs.</li>
            <li> wonderful fine mist.  Haven&#x27;t traveled with them, but don&#x27;t appear that they will leak.  Good purchase.</li>
            <li> My daughter wanted to experiment with making her own perfumes. These work perfectly.</li>
            <li> I had bad luck with these bottles. Three of them are defective. They either leak terribly when you spray them (I end up with a ahndful of the product I was spraying) or the don&#x27;t spray at all and just dribble down the side. Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t get around to using them quickly enough to be eligible for a return :(</li>
            <li> Arrived on time!! Love them.</li>
