            <li>Its beautiful everyday.</li>
            <li>It is a very uplifting scent in deed!!</li>
            <li>Smells great -  just like green Livesavers</li>
            <li>They are fresh and I will continue to use them as air freshener in the diffuser.</li>
            <li>Just makes person want to smile.</li>
            <li>When I inhale it I can&#x27;t help but smile.  </li>
            <li>However, I found it at Vitamin Cottage for $10, so it&#x27;s worth it to shop around.</li>
            <li>All of the Now Foods oils that I&#x27;ve had the pleasure to smell are clean and pure.</li>
            <li>Just the right balance of citrus.</li>
            <li>It actually was very strong just smelling it from the bottle</li>
            <li>I bought the Now Foods Peaceful Sleep, Cheer Up Buttercup and Metal Focus all together.</li>
            <li>Smells great but scent doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>This blend smells Exactly like lifesavers candy.</li>
            <li>This may just be my favorite essential oil blend out there.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li>Smelled great at first, but I used it in my NOW diffuser and the scent didn&#x27;t last as long as I was expecting.  </li>
            <li>The &#x27;Cheer Up Buttercup&#x27; essential oils are pleasant, but not nearly enough to &#x27;cheer me up&#x27;.</li>
            <li>Not sure anyone felt any more cheerful</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the scent and brand along with the price (I paid) which was very reasonable.</li>
            <li>It really does cheer you up.  </li>
            <li>Works really well with my diffuser.  </li>
            <li>Very citrus-y, but not over bearing.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t  really like it.</li>
            <li>I much prefer using this to a candle.</li>
            <li>Very citrusy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve diffused this for 4 days straight.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Eventually I will use it for other things...a visit to Pinterest is in order... :)</li>
            <li>I use this more than any of the other blends I have.  </li>
            <li>so I can sample some of the other scents before I buy more.</li>
            <li>This oil smells clean and refreshing, while the wax melts always have a sweet fake smell.</li>
            <li>I was expecting the scent to last for the full 6 hours.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this oil.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>The Peaceful Sleep and Cheer up Buttercup have a yellow color that stained my humidifier.</li>
            <li>I am surprised by the color.</li>
            <li>I prefer them to many of the other more expensive brands.</li>
            <li>I had a smile on my face with the first few minites of starting my diffuser.</li>

            <li> However, I found it at Vitamin Cottage for $10, so it&#x27;s worth it to shop around.</li>
            <li> All of the Now Foods oils that I&#x27;ve had the pleasure to smell are clean and pure.</li>
            <li> Just the right balance of citrus.</li>
            <li> It actually was very strong just smelling it from the bottle</li>
            <li> I bought the Now Foods Peaceful Sleep, Cheer Up Buttercup and Metal Focus all together.</li>
            <li> Smells great but scent doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> This blend smells Exactly like lifesavers candy.</li>
            <li> This may just be my favorite essential oil blend out there.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> Smelled great at first, but I used it in my NOW diffuser and the scent didn&#x27;t last as long as I was expecting.  </li>
            <li> The &#x27;Cheer Up Buttercup&#x27; essential oils are pleasant, but not nearly enough to &#x27;cheer me up&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Not sure anyone felt any more cheerful</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the scent and brand along with the price (I paid) which was very reasonable.</li>
            <li> It really does cheer you up.  </li>
            <li> Works really well with my diffuser.  </li>
            <li> Very citrus-y, but not over bearing.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t  really like it.</li>
            <li> I much prefer using this to a candle.</li>
            <li> Very citrusy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve diffused this for 4 days straight.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Eventually I will use it for other things...a visit to Pinterest is in order... :)</li>
            <li> I use this more than any of the other blends I have.  </li>
            <li> so I can sample some of the other scents before I buy more.</li>
            <li> This oil smells clean and refreshing, while the wax melts always have a sweet fake smell.</li>
            <li> I was expecting the scent to last for the full 6 hours.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this oil.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> The Peaceful Sleep and Cheer up Buttercup have a yellow color that stained my humidifier.</li>
            <li> I am surprised by the color.</li>
            <li> I prefer them to many of the other more expensive brands.</li>
            <li> I had a smile on my face with the first few minites of starting my diffuser.</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s hard to purchase things like this online since you can&#x27;t smell it first</li>
            <li> I actually prefer the essential oils smells over the wax melts that scentsy or pink zebra sells.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time too.</li>
            <li> scents)-- just like Lady Grey tea.  </li>
            <li> My husband didn&#x27;t complain of scent and he will if something is too strange or perfumey.</li>
            <li> I received many compliments on the scent and had several people who asked to smell my locket over and over (awkward!).</li>
            <li> A few drops of this on cotton balls around the house or in classroom keeps us wide awake.</li>
            <li> The oil seems a little thin, so I don&#x27;t know how long it will last.</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s uplifting aromatherapy you&#x27;re looking for, try lemon and a little lavender diffused.</li>
            <li> I used this in my oil locket and the few drops I used lasted 4 days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this in my scentsy warmer by adding a tablespoon of water with a few drops.</li>
            <li> I put this on my wrists and a few drops in my bath.</li>
            <li> The bottle arrived an oily mess cause leaked inside its packaging!</li>
            <li> Diffuse it everyday!</li>
            <li> This buttercup&#x27;s too lazy ):</li>
            <li> Not a good blend.</li>
            <li> Smells like weak fresca.</li>
            <li> It never seems cloying or stale.</li>
            <li> My family hated the smell of this blend</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The fruit scents used to make this are a really good combination. It does lift my spirits to smell this oil, especially with a diffuser.</li>
            <li> All of the Now Foods oils that I&#x27;ve had the pleasure to smell are clean and pure. This blend really is cheerful.</li>
            <li> Wow! This stuff smells great. It honestly does raise my spirits and keeps me alert whenever I use it.</li>
            <li> I love this smells. It truly makes me happy</li>
            <li> I bought the Now Foods Peaceful Sleep, Cheer Up Buttercup and Metal Focus all together. The Peaceful Sleep and Cheer up Buttercup have a yellow color that stained my humidifier. They both smell similar with a citrus scent. They are fresh and I will continue to use them as air freshener in the diffuser. I am surprised by the color. I don&#x27;t think citrus is a good sleep time smell. I won&#x27;t buy again. I like to make my own blends.</li>
            <li> Most uplifting blend. Just makes person want to smile. I call it my wake up buttercup.</li>
            <li> Smells great but scent doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Great scent. It really does cheer you up.  Puts a smile on my face!</li>
            <li> Wonderful cheerful fragrance, love this oil blend</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great!&lt;br /&gt;I got this to make my own version of Poo-Pourri, but liked it so much that I now add it to the dryer for a fresh cheery scent on the laundry.&lt;br /&gt;Eventually I will use it for other things...a visit to Pinterest is in order... :)</li>
            <li> Used in soap making loved it.  Just the right balance of citrus.</li>
            <li> Works really well with my diffuser.  This one smells very fresh, not perfume like at all.  Very uplifting and refreshing from the citrus notes.  Lasts a long time too.</li>
            <li> I Love this blend for use during the day in my moisturizing body oil (I add it to my coconut oil or grape seed oil).  When I inhale it I can&#x27;t help but smile.  The packaging is pretty cheerful too :-)</li>
            <li> Very uplifting and clean smelling! Diffuse it everyday!</li>
            <li> This blend smells Exactly like lifesavers candy. It has a very sweet candy scent. If you like that kind of smell you will be in heaven, if you don&#x27;t like sticky sweet this isn&#x27;t for you!</li>
            <li> This may just be my favorite essential oil blend out there. It really is cheerful!</li>
            <li> smells so good. very clean and fresh. citrus blend.</li>
            <li> AMAZING, its one of the best ! bravo</li>
            <li> This smell is so clean a refreshing. This is a must for the future...</li>
            <li> How many times can I write the word &amp;#34;LOVE&amp;#34;!! I take this bottle every where I go. Very clean smell!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a &amp;#34;happy&amp;#34; smelling scent, just like depicted on the bottle. The oil seems a little thin, so I don&#x27;t know how long it will last. Surely a scent that will pick you up on a dreary day!</li>
            <li> Smells great -  just like green Livesavers</li>
            <li> Love the fragrance!  Nice, clean scent.</li>
            <li> This smells like lemon pie or lemon sugar cookies.  Works great in an ultrasonic diffuser.  I bought it for a gift, took one smell and ended up keeping it.  Definitely an invigorating scent!  If someone was suffering with depression or anxiety, &amp;#34;Cheer Up Buttercup&amp;#34; should be in their medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> LOVE this scent. great brand, great price also for the size. did I say I LOVE this scent.</li>
            <li> This smells so good.  I dilute it to use in a roller ball bottle so this will last me a while.  I use this more than any of the other blends I have.  I kind of wear it as a perfume now.</li>
            <li> Great essential oil blend!  I have made it into a air refresher.  Perfect for those times you need a quick pick me up!</li>
            <li> What a great, cheerful scent, perfect for my diffuser. Very citrus-y, but not over bearing. I use several different brands of essential oils, and can&#x27;t tell any difference between this Now brand and the more expensive brands. It arrived without incident and on time.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t  really like it.</li>
            <li> I love how this smells (unlike a lot of the other essential oils that I own-- VERY good stuff, but NOT my favorite scents)-- just like Lady Grey tea.  It&#x27;s citrusy and wonderful and does cheer me up. However, I found it at Vitamin Cottage for $10, so it&#x27;s worth it to shop around.</li>
            <li> Seriously love this. I always get compliments on my &amp;#34;parfume&amp;#34;. It lasts a lot longer on clothing than on skin. Love it though, really does uplift me!</li>
            <li> Love the smell! I use this in my diffuser and it makes me feel brighter and happier when I use it.</li>
            <li> A few drops of this on cotton balls around the house or in classroom keeps us wide awake. The fragrance is so fresh and clean smelling.  Massage specialist also told me she uses it all the time.</li>
            <li> Great Citrus smell and very uplifting!  I use this in my oriole to fuser in the whole house smells great</li>
            <li> LOVE the citrus smell!!</li>
            <li> Smells good. A bit strong but I still like it. I would just recommend using smaller amounts than suggested on the bottle.</li>
            <li> This smells so good, it really does cheer up the room. I use this in a diffuser at work to keep my office smelling good and to keep my energy levels up during the day.</li>
            <li> Now is my favorite EO brand!!</li>
            <li> It really does smell happy... Almost like lemon fruit loops</li>
            <li> Smells cheery, nothing too special, is great value for the cost.</li>
            <li> Cheerful, sweet citrus scent that is strong but not overpowering. I used this in my oil locket and the few drops I used lasted 4 days. I received many compliments on the scent and had several people who asked to smell my locket over and over (awkward!). :) Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Smell Yummy!! It is a very uplifting scent in deed!! Highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> I use this with a diffuser and it is a mice, pleasant scent. I much prefer using this to a candle.</li>
            <li> this stuff does cheer you up. It actually was very strong just smelling it from the bottle but when I put this in my diffuser, I was pleased with the effect. Not overpowering. I had a smile on my face with the first few minites of starting my diffuser. My husband didn&#x27;t complain of scent and he will if something is too strange or perfumey.</li>
            <li> Smelled great at first, but I used it in my NOW diffuser and the scent didn&#x27;t last as long as I was expecting.  The diffuser has a 6hr automatic shut off with instructions on using 5 drops (or more if you desire a stronger scent) to 4 ounces of water.  I placed 7 drops.  I was expecting the scent to last for the full 6 hours.  I left the room after about 45 minutes, and came back at about the 1 hour mark, and could no longer smell the oil.  The diffuser was still giving off &amp;#34;steam,&amp;#34; but there was no longer a scent coming out.</li>
            <li> What a delicious smell, so vibrant and cheerful. Already ordered 2 more bottles!</li>
            <li> very nice light scent</li>
            <li> Wonderful smelling oil provides a remarkably instant lift.</li>
            <li> I love the NOW oils and this is a great cheerful blend to use in cleaning products, burning, on sheets for a fresh feel, etc.  I highly recommend the scent and brand along with the price (I paid) which was very reasonable.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE..... Smells. Smell is wonderful. Will purchase again. Thank you. Quick delivery also.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with my purchase. Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> Smells great, puts a smile on your face</li>
            <li> Cheer up buttercup is a happy scent.  Love to diffuse it on winter days and dream of the sun.</li>
            <li> This smells great and works well in my diffuser.  I&#x27;d buy it again!</li>
            <li> The &#x27;Cheer Up Buttercup&#x27; essential oils are pleasant, but not nearly enough to &#x27;cheer me up&#x27;. The bottle arrived an oily mess cause leaked inside its packaging! I almost sent it back, but didn&#x27;t. This buttercup&#x27;s too lazy ):</li>
            <li> This is a great scent to diffuse or just breathe in.  The citrus smell wakes me up and feel better.</li>
            <li> Got this to help with my anxiety and depression instead of going on meds. At first I was not sure it would help. But have been using for about 2 weeks and there is a noticable difference. The days I do use it (mixed with a carrier oil on the bottom of my feet) I don&#x27;t have any issues with anxiety or depression and I have more energetic. I also use it on my kids when they are grumpy and it seems to help. They become very happy and wild!</li>
            <li> Citrus and cheer go together in this perfect blend.  It spread through my home and lights your step as well as your mood.  NOW has made another great blend.</li>
            <li> Very nice citrus scent. I know it&#x27;s hard to purchase things like this online since you can&#x27;t smell it first but I took a chance. Not disappointed...it smells clean and, dare I say, uplifting. However, I still hope to run across a store that sells these so I can sample some of the other scents before I buy more.</li>
            <li> Probably the best smelling oil blend there is.&lt;br /&gt;I have over 100 oils in my collection and this is definitely one of my favorites.&lt;br /&gt;And since it is made with citrus oils it is immune boosting too!</li>
            <li> Its beautiful everyday. It never seems cloying or stale.</li>
            <li> Love it!! Smells so wonderful and really does seem to lighten everyone&#x27;s mood. My daughter loves it and asks me to diffuse it every day!</li>
            <li> smells great. Its yellow in color so great for tinting bath bombs</li>
            <li> This is such a happy scent, really brightens your mood.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t care for the scent.</li>
            <li> Smells like pine sol. Not as cheery</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this in my scentsy warmer by adding a tablespoon of water with a few drops. The house smells amazing. I actually prefer the essential oils smells over the wax melts that scentsy or pink zebra sells. This oil smells clean and refreshing, while the wax melts always have a sweet fake smell.</li>
            <li> I put this on my wrists and a few drops in my bath. It smells so good and seems to be uplifting!</li>
            <li> Absolutely an amazing aroma. Makes your day better.</li>
            <li> This is a great oil with a great aroma! Very happy with this purchase. Shipping time was phenomenal.</li>
            <li> Great product with excellent capabilities! I love rubbing some with a carrier oil on my kids feet when they&#x27;re grumpy.</li>
            <li> Very citrusy. Not sure anyone felt any more cheerful but the house smelled nice.</li>
            <li> Not my favorite.  Smells like weak fresca. I was expecting something with a stronger kick of citrus brightening. I tried diffusing it but the smell wasn&#x27;t good. Not a good blend. If it&#x27;s uplifting aromatherapy you&#x27;re looking for, try lemon and a little lavender diffused.</li>
            <li> Great product thank you</li>
            <li> smells so good!  The name matches the smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve diffused this for 4 days straight. I&#x27;m in love with this scent!! Makes me calm and happy!</li>
            <li> My favorite scent by now foods. It smells like clean, fruity, citrus.</li>
            <li> I love the scent! It is bright and citrusy and smells fantastic. I use it in my diffuser and it also smells good on the skin. I love this company, they make amazing oils. I prefer them to many of the other more expensive brands. I highly recommend this oil.</li>
            <li> Love the &#x27;happy&#x27; smell- energizing</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it has any effect on my mood, but I do like how it smells.</li>
            <li> My family hated the smell of this blend</li>
            <li> Out of all of the EO&#x27;s, that I have, this is my all time favorite.  Everyone that I have talked into buying it now says the same time.  It truly is a Cheer up blend.</li>
