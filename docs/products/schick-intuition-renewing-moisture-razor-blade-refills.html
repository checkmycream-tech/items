            <li>thanks Dad!)</li>
            <li>Very thankful that still make them!</li>

            <li>;)</li>
            <li>I cant be with out this razor specially since my body is very sensitive.</li>
            <li>Slightly pricey, but better than anything else out there!  </li>
            <li>I wish they&#x27;d reformulate the soap to make it last a little longer but all in all these are great for the convenience.  </li>
            <li>Oh and they make &amp;#34;trimming the ol&#x27; hedge&amp;#34; much easier.</li>
            <li>I love how well this works it;s the only way i can shave my legs with out getting major razor burn!</li>
            <li>The only reason I give it a 4 is because it dissolves so quickly.</li>
            <li>These work well and are super convenient for someone like me who needs to shave her legs daily.  </li>
            <li>Only reason I gave them a 4 instead of a 5 is because unless you keep it completely dry between the shavings, the shaving soap portion dissolves and only good for lie 2-3 shaves all together.</li>
            <li>the cartridges just don&#x27;t seem to last as long any more.</li>
            <li>Only downside is the cost, but still worth it.</li>
            <li>Of course, the product is not a very &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; option for leg shaving as the cartridges wear out quickly and are rather large to throw in the trash.  </li>
            <li>This is the first razor that I have used and it  leaves my skin feeling very soft, there are no bumps, my skinn doesn&#x27;t itch and the hair doesn&#x27;t come back as fast...</li>
            <li>The back of the box has &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34; written right on it.</li>
            <li>My legs are always super dry and razor burnt after shaving with the &amp;#34;nice&amp;#34; razors and creams, gels, conditioners...</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get the closest shave with the blades, but I still love them because I hardly ever cut my knees or ankles with these.</li>
            <li>the Shick intuition razors give me a soft and moisturized shave.</li>
            <li>I have a 15 month old who stands and screams at the shower</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;Schick Intuition Naturals Sensitive Care formula is hypoallergenic and fragrance</li>
            <li>Makes shaving much easier and cleaner than with regular shave gel.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these for ladies with dry or sensitive skin.</li>

            <li> Decently priced when bought in bulk, but not a cheap price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Much safer - only a very few knicks over the years.  </li>
            <li> However, the soap on the razor only lasts through one leg-shaving, sometimes less.  </li>
            <li> Been using Intuition for a few years now and won&#x27;t go back to anything else.</li>
            <li> Also, the wide shaving head takes some getting used to at first, but now &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; sized razor heads feel weird.</li>
            <li> In fact I haven&#x27;t used anything other than Intuition since they first came out approximately 12 years ago (give or take a few).  </li>

            <li> This makes it a bit pricier then some other options</li>
            <li> Water and residue fills the handle of the razor, so you have to hang it upside down for storage</li>

            <li> The packaging also leaves a lot of waste to dispose of.  </li>
            <li> and my razor was just a plain razor...</li>
            <li> Since using this I do not have any allergic reactions anymore and no more bumps.</li>
            <li> Lotion Head usually runs out before (IMHO)</li>
            <li> the blade is too dull to continue using&lt;br</li>
            <li> The hair on my legs is sparse, and it grows slowly</li>
            <li> Lotion Head will break off and become almost useless if dropped or sometimes in a checked bag on a plane (sad day when I went to shave for a wedding weekend</li>
            <li> This product is expensive but you are paying for the convenience.  </li>

            <li> love it. excellent quality</li>
            <li> I love how well this works it;s the only way i can shave my legs with out getting major razor burn! The only reason I give it a 4 is because it dissolves so quickly.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and the Shick intuition razors give me a soft and moisturized shave. The built in soap helps moisturize and soften my skin as I am shaving. No redness or itchy bumps afterwards.</li>
            <li> I will purchase again ~ very nicely packaged which is greatly appreciated. These are wonderful for people like me with allergies to perfumes, etc.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I am glad that these refills fit any of the Intuition razors, that way I can pick and choose.&lt;br /&gt;These have a good neutral scent, not overly floral or masculine which some companies falter on.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> the cartridges just don&#x27;t seem to last as long any more.</li>
            <li> Love my Schick intuition razor. Since using this I do not have any allergic reactions anymore and no more bumps. I just wish they were a bit cheaper and would last longer.</li>
            <li> I discovered the Schick Intuition razor last spring and the idea intrigued me. My legs are always super dry and razor burnt after shaving with the &amp;#34;nice&amp;#34; razors and creams, gels, conditioners... etc. So, I went out and bought one at Wal-Mart to try it out. Something about this razor just works for me! I still get bumps and slight irritation, but nothing like I used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Lotion Head means you don&#x27;t have to use any soap or gel while shaving.&lt;br /&gt;- Pivoting Head moves with your curves&lt;br /&gt;- No perfumes or extra gunk that usually makes my legs overreact&lt;br /&gt;- Decently priced when bought in bulk, but not a cheap price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Lotion Head usually runs out before (IMHO) the blade is too dull to continue using&lt;br /&gt;- Lotion Head will break off and become almost useless if dropped or sometimes in a checked bag on a plane (sad day when I went to shave for a wedding weekend and my razor was just a plain razor...)&lt;br /&gt;- Water and residue fills the handle of the razor, so you have to hang it upside down for storage otherwise mold will grow&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the cons can be worked around if you know about them, which is why I gave this razor 5 stars! I foresee myself buying these for years to come!</li>
            <li> This is the only razor I use now. I have way more body hair than I deserve to have (thanks Dad!) so I do a lot of maintenance.  LOL They are great in that all you need is water (like all shaving be WELL hydrated!) so no shaving gel/cream expense. Been using Intuition for a few years now and won&#x27;t go back to anything else. Also, the wide shaving head takes some getting used to at first, but now &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; sized razor heads feel weird.</li>
            <li> This is the first razor that I have used and it  leaves my skin feeling very soft, there are no bumps, my skinn doesn&#x27;t itch and the hair doesn&#x27;t come back as fast... I&#x27;m glad I chose Intuition!!!</li>
            <li> I have had closer shaves but none that were this quick and easy. I have a 15 month old who stands and screams at the shower so trust me when I say these are perfect for us speed shavers. Oh and they make &amp;#34;trimming the ol&#x27; hedge&amp;#34; much easier.</li>
            <li> Been using these for years. They are the only razors that don&#x27;t cause my skin to break out. Very thankful that still make them!</li>
            <li> CHEAPER THAN TARGET AND I DON&#x27;T HAVE TO DRIVE TO THE STORE.  I HAVE USED THESE RAZORS FOREVER.  I LOVE BEING ABLE TO BUY THEM ONLINE.</li>
            <li> I personally have NEVER cut myself with these razors, they leave no razor burn, and you do not need shaving cream to use them. They slide really easy and give a close shave. All in all it&#x27;s my favorite product on the market. Only downside is the cost, but still worth it.</li>
            <li> Good product and reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Been using these now for a while. They make my legs very smooth! I will be buying them.again</li>
            <li> I bought them because at the time it was cheaper then my local walmart. I like these because they are good with my skin. I have sensitive skin and they work great. will definitely repurchase again.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years. I love that I don&#x27;t need to use shaving cream or lotion! I&#x27;m always in a hurry, and anything that I can do to save time is helpful.</li>
            <li> Thank you for such good product and for sending it on time for Christmas</li>
            <li> I love love  love this item. I cant be with out this razor specially since my body is very sensitive. I give it a 5 stars.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Schick Intuition Naturals Sensitive Care formula is hypoallergenic and fragrance free.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bullpucky. The back of the box has &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34; written right on it.</li>
            <li> Makes shaving much easier and cleaner than with regular shave gel.</li>
            <li> Good deal- cheaper price than stores</li>
            <li> These are the only blades I buy now. The hair on my legs is sparse, and it grows slowly so one blade lasts me about 6 weeks.  I highly recommend these for ladies with dry or sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My favorite razors!  In fact I haven&#x27;t used anything other than Intuition since they first came out approximately 12 years ago (give or take a few).  No need for shaving cream now!  Quick &amp; easy!  Much safer - only a very few knicks over the years.  Slightly pricey, but better than anything else out there!  Wish I could find a value buy of like maybe 20+, so I could purchase them one a year or something.</li>
            <li> Nice scent and leaves skin soft. I don&#x27;t get the closest shave with the blades, but I still love them because I hardly ever cut my knees or ankles with these. The trade off between really close shave and not having cuts is worth it.</li>
            <li> These work well and are super convenient for someone like me who needs to shave her legs daily.  I&#x27;ve been using them for years.

The packaging also leaves a lot of waste to dispose of.  Still, I&#x27;ll keep buying due to the convenience.  Did I say these are convenient? ;)</li>
            <li> I love these. I have sensitive skin and these are absolutely great for me. No need to carry shaving gel around is always a plus. Only reason I gave them a 4 instead of a 5 is because unless you keep it completely dry between the shavings, the shaving soap portion dissolves and only good for lie 2-3 shaves all together. This makes it a bit pricier then some other options</li>
