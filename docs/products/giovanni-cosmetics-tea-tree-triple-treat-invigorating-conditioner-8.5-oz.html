            <li>The tea tree triple treat line is best for sensitive skin and irritated scalp including redness, itching and dandruff.  </li>
            <li>First is the fresh smell of peppermint, then comes the wonderful tingly sensation it gives the scalp.</li>
            <li>It nicely coats my hair, but is easily rinsed away.  </li>

            <li>This is a great product that I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this conditioner.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair and need a conditioner that&#x27;s not \\&quot;heavy.\\&quot; Leaves my hair feeling clean and healthy.</li>
            <li>This concoction does smell pretty good, and it is packaged in an easy to use plastic container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love that this product is cruelty free.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s by far the best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used...and so reasonably priced!</li>
            <li>It detangles my hair and makes it easy to brush after my shower.</li>
            <li>I first tried the giovanni tea tree shampoo &amp; conditioner &amp; loved them, great smell, good slip, left my hair very soft.</li>
            <li>Perhaps, I should have asked for a replacement, but it seemed fine after thawing.  </li>
            <li>I have fine, curly hair which can be quite brittle at times.</li>
            <li>i liked the Giovanni deep conditioner better, this one gave me so many knots in my hair that i was going to cut it short thinking my hair was damaged, but when i started using another conditioner my hair got better, the tea tree shampoo is great for an itchy scalp but the conditioner just made my hair get knotted up it was a nightmare to comb my hair.</li>
            <li>Nice smell, decent conditioning.  </li>
            <li>I decided I would try the leave in conditioner &amp; LOVED it, had good slip &amp; it even defined my curls without having to use any defining products &amp; left my hair really soft...</li>
            <li>This is a really really good conditioner especially if you have fine hair</li>
            <li>By the end of the day, my hair still feels clean.</li>
            <li>I also use Giovanni&#x27;s smooth as silk line which is super moisturizing (</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting ready to order more.  </li>
            <li>So far I am loving this conditioner.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t add a lot of volume, but my straight, almost shoulder-length hair does feel bouncy and light, making it easy to flat-iron afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t like the scent of mint you can try one of their other shampoo/conditioner combos, they&#x27;re all great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While I expected the wonderful scent and tingle of the scalp, I was quite surprised with how well it conditioned my hair.</li>
            <li>The smell was quite pleasant and it left my hair not only smelling good, but my curls were soft as well.</li>
            <li>This is the 4th conditioner (including EO, Alba) and this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>No other conditioner keeps my curls lovely like it.</li>
            <li>made my hair feel soft, manageable &amp; very moisturized:)  </li>
            <li>This listing says that the first ingredients are Water, Tea Tree leaf oil, peppermint leaf extract, eucalyptus oil, thyme extract</li>
            <li>After this  experience, I will never buy hair care products without first finding out what&#x27;s in them.</li>
            <li>The tea tree conditioner has a very invigorating minty scent.</li>
            <li>Really.)</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to use too much</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s the boss and is always looking for products no longer available at the local store.</li>
            <li>This conditioner has really helped to make my hair feel healthier and stronger.  </li>
            <li>I also really like how this conditioner smells.  </li>
            <li>THANKS AGAIN</li>
            <li>After drying, my hair feels soft and smooth, not heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li>I have fine wavy to curly long hair and a super sensitive scalp/skin.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know if the other Giovanni products contain the same chemical stew as this one, but all the alcohols cannot be good for hair or scalp.</li>
            <li>I originally found it at a local organic grocery store in bulk.  </li>
            <li>IT LEFT MY HAIR VERY SOFT AND TANGLE FREE.</li>
            <li>This is a nice conditioner with a delicate scent.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for 3 years now and every time I stray I run right back to it.</li>
            <li>I use this instead of shampoo for my super dry hair.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is subtle and natural and it does a really great job of conditioning my dry hair.</li>
            <li>so it lasts for a long time - well worth the money.</li>
            <li>My hair was baby soft!</li>
            <li>And finally, the wondeful smell lingers on my smooth, silky hair all day long.</li>
            <li>I will definitely RE-ORDER this in the full size bottle next time around.</li>
            <li>Works REALLY well for me--my hair is a lot shinier and has grown more since I&#x27;ve been using Giovanni products this past year than it has ever in my entire adult life.</li>
            <li>Leaves it soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t like the shampoo as much...just cleaned very well, not moisturizing enough, but</li>
            <li>I only need to use a small amount on my long thick hair, and my hair feels clean and the tangles can easily be removed by running my fingers through or with a brush.</li>

            <li> After reading a few other reviews (some not so positive), I decided to take the chance and give this conditioner a try.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a conditioner to help with my dry scalp, and had read a lot of reviews on different websites about this product before I purchased it.</li>
            <li> I have type 4, thick, very coily,curly hair &amp; this</li>
            <li> Other products I have tried have left my hair dry and flat.  </li>
            <li> I like it a lot, but give it only 4 stars because Trader Joe&#x27;s sells one a lot like it for half the price.</li>
            <li> It is expensive in stores here in Colorado Springs but the price was right for what it does to your hair.</li>
            <li> It leaves me with stiff, dry hair and an itchy head.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Giovanni Cosmetics Tea Tree Triple Treat Conditioner for a few weeks now along with the shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I have an injured wrist and couldn&#x27;t do it until after adding a few drops of water to get it to flow.  </li>
            <li> Triple Treat has a minty scent, and when it gets in your eyes, it can be uncomfortable with a minty feel - definitely, not what you would want in your eyes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Giving it 5 stars, despite the small issue with the bottle design.</li>
            <li> I usually sleep with the conditioner and wash it out in the morning.</li>
            <li> Once thawed, it was so hard to squeeze out of the bottle.  </li>
            <li> Regardless of what shampoo I use in tandem, this conditioner and my hair are not a good match.</li>
            <li> Although the conditioner is a bit difficult to squeeze out of the bottle, it is not as thick as it might appear.</li>
            <li> Giovanni haircare products work just as well as expensive salon brands at a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> I wash my hair every 2-3 days to prevent breakage and frizzing, but this can lead to oily hair if using the wrong product.</li>
            <li> I subtracted one star because the bottle it comes in is horrible!</li>

            <li> This is a great conditioner. It is expensive in stores here in Colorado Springs but the price was right for what it does to your hair. Leaves it soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> This is a nice conditioner with a delicate scent. I like it a lot, but give it only 4 stars because Trader Joe&#x27;s sells one a lot like it for half the price.</li>
            <li> Giovanni haircare products work just as well as expensive salon brands at a fraction of the price. All of their conditioners are phthalate-free, SLA-free, paraben-free, and petrolatum-free. The tea tree conditioner has a very invigorating minty scent. If you don&#x27;t like the scent of mint you can try one of their other shampoo/conditioner combos, they&#x27;re all great.</li>
            <li> I love this product, my hair feels and looks great!!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a conditioner to help with my dry scalp, and had read a lot of reviews on different websites about this product before I purchased it. Great value here at Amazon....I&#x27;m a fan! I&#x27;ve even co-washed with this and was very pleased with the results. (So much better than that Wen Tea Tree Cleansing Conditioner! Really.)</li>
            <li> IT WORKS WELL AND HELPED REDUCED HAIR BREAKAGE THAT  I HAVE BEEN EXPERIENCING.</li>
            <li> I first tried the giovanni tea tree shampoo &amp; conditioner &amp; loved them, great smell, good slip, left my hair very soft. I decided I would try the leave in conditioner &amp; LOVED it, had good slip &amp; it even defined my curls without having to use any defining products &amp; left my hair really soft...would def recommend.</li>
            <li> This listing says that the first ingredients are Water, Tea Tree leaf oil, peppermint leaf extract, eucalyptus oil, thyme extract etcetera...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is what the bottle says:  Water, Cetyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Brassicamidopropl Dimethlyamine, Panthenol, Cetrimonium Chloride, Cetearyl Alcohol, Hydroxypropyl Guar, Behentrimonium Methosulfate  and THEN finally some botanical ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a lie!</li>
            <li> This shampoo is great!! The tea tree makes your scalp tingle.  Nice way to wake up in the morning, just don&#x27;t get it in your eyes...</li>
            <li> This is a really really good conditioner especially if you have fine hair and it smells nice. You don&#x27;t need to use too much so it lasts for a long time - well worth the money.</li>
            <li> This is the 4th conditioner (including EO, Alba) and this is by far my favorite. I only need to use a small amount on my long thick hair, and my hair feels clean and the tangles can easily be removed by running my fingers through or with a brush. By the end of the day, my hair still feels clean. This Tea Tree Triple Treat has a minty scent, and when it gets in your eyes, it can be uncomfortable with a minty feel - definitely, not what you would want in your eyes. I love that this product is cruelty free. I recommend search around for a lower price on the internet (vitacost has great prices).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the Giovanni Cosmetics Tea Tree Triple Treat Invigorating Conditioner for about two months and have given up on it. Regardless of what shampoo I use in tandem, this conditioner and my hair are not a good match. It leaves me with stiff, dry hair and an itchy head. This concoction does smell pretty good, and it is packaged in an easy to use plastic container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if the other Giovanni products contain the same chemical stew as this one, but all the alcohols cannot be good for hair or scalp. After this  experience, I will never buy hair care products without first finding out what&#x27;s in them.</li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love this product.  I originally found it at a local organic grocery store in bulk.  It&#x27;s by far the best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used...and so reasonably priced!</li>
            <li> Surprisingly, I was very pleased with the results of this conditioner.  I have type 4, thick, very coily,curly hair &amp; this made my hair feel soft, manageable &amp; very moisturized:)  I had ordered this in a trial size along with the shampoo because I had never tried it before...didn&#x27;t like the shampoo as much...just cleaned very well, not moisturizing enough, but I will definitely RE-ORDER this in the full size bottle next time around.</li>
            <li> After reading a few other reviews (some not so positive), I decided to take the chance and give this conditioner a try. I am glad I did, because it worked well for me! The smell was quite pleasant and it left my hair not only smelling good, but my curls were soft as well. A bonus for me too is that there are no sulfates, phlates, no animal by-products, and it&#x27;s not tested on animals. I remember that my local CVS sold this too but at double the price than Amazon. Glad I bought this and I will for sure buy more! Very satisfied and I&#x27;m sure you will be too!</li>
            <li> I love Giovanni. No other conditioner keeps my curls lovely like it. I have been using it for 3 years now and every time I stray I run right back to it.</li>
            <li> The name Triple Treat refers to the three organic oils of peppermint, rosemary, and eucalyptus. But for me it refers to the triple sensory experience. First is the fresh smell of peppermint, then comes the wonderful tingly sensation it gives the scalp. And finally, the wondeful smell lingers on my smooth, silky hair all day long. Yup, it doesn&#x27;t get much better than this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I expected the wonderful scent and tingle of the scalp, I was quite surprised with how well it conditioned my hair. Although the conditioner is a bit difficult to squeeze out of the bottle, it is not as thick as it might appear. It is a nice medium-weight cream consistency and not runny as I feared it might be, since it was billed as a light-weight conditioner. It nicely coats my hair, but is easily rinsed away.  It detangles my hair and makes it easy to brush after my shower. After drying, my hair feels soft and smooth, not heavy or greasy. It doesn&#x27;t add a lot of volume, but my straight, almost shoulder-length hair does feel bouncy and light, making it easy to flat-iron afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Giving it 5 stars, despite the small issue with the bottle design.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner.  I have fine wavy to curly long hair and a super sensitive scalp/skin.  Giovanni has been the only brand that I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t irritate my scalp and skin.  The tea tree triple treat line is best for sensitive skin and irritated scalp including redness, itching and dandruff.  I also use Giovanni&#x27;s smooth as silk line which is super moisturizing (something curly hair can&#x27;t get enough of)--so I end up rotating the two a lot or combining or just using whichever one my hair seems to need more of at the moment. Works REALLY well for me--my hair is a lot shinier and has grown more since I&#x27;ve been using Giovanni products this past year than it has ever in my entire adult life.</li>
            <li> My hair was baby soft! The longer you leave it in the better. I usually sleep with the conditioner and wash it out in the morning.</li>
            <li> mom loves it and that is what counts. She&#x27;s the boss and is always looking for products no longer available at the local store.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  I&#x27;m getting ready to order more.  I haven&#x27;t had an itchy head since I started to use it.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Giovanni Cosmetics Tea Tree Triple Treat Conditioner for a few weeks now along with the shampoo.  So far I am loving this conditioner.  Other products I have tried have left my hair dry and flat.  This conditioner has really helped to make my hair feel healthier and stronger.  I also really like how this conditioner smells.  This is a great product that I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t order this in the middle of winter, unless you want to thaw out a block of conditioner ice.  I think freezing may have ruined my conditioner.  Once thawed, it was so hard to squeeze out of the bottle.  I have an injured wrist and couldn&#x27;t do it until after adding a few drops of water to get it to flow.  Removing the cap was a wrestling nightmare and my bottle was all mangled from squeezing and twisting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hard to say about the quality of the product.  Not as good as I remember St. Ive&#x27;s Swiss Formula Hair Repair.  Which I bought this as a substitute.  It did feel great, but I probably would look for another product.  Perhaps, I should have asked for a replacement, but it seemed fine after thawing.  Rated 3 to be fair.</li>
            <li> i liked the Giovanni deep conditioner better, this one gave me so many knots in my hair that i was going to cut it short thinking my hair was damaged, but when i started using another conditioner my hair got better, the tea tree shampoo is great for an itchy scalp but the conditioner just made my hair get knotted up it was a nightmare to comb my hair.</li>
            <li> Conditioner is great - smells good too. I have very fine hair and need a conditioner that&#x27;s not \\&quot;heavy.\\&quot; Leaves my hair feeling clean and healthy. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I use this instead of shampoo for my super dry hair. It cleans without stripping all of the moisture out. I love this stuff.  I subtracted one star because the bottle it comes in is horrible!</li>
            <li> Smells good works great. Maybe because I have a lot of hair but I feel like I need to use a ton. Still good. I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> IT LEFT MY HAIR VERY SOFT AND TANGLE FREE. LIKED THE INVIGORATING SMELL. WENT WELL WITH THE SHAMPOO.REORDER-YES.  THANKS AGAIN</li>
            <li> Nice smell, decent conditioning.  It is not that invigorating, though.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this conditioner. The fragrance is subtle and natural and it does a really great job of conditioning my dry hair.</li>
            <li> My hair feels very nice when using this product. I have fine, curly hair which can be quite brittle at times. I wash my hair every 2-3 days to prevent breakage and frizzing, but this can lead to oily hair if using the wrong product. This product and the shampoo were very effective for my hair.</li>
            <li> I love love love this conditioner!! I wish I could find it in a bigger bottle.</li>
