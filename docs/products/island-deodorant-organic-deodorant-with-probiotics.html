            <li>but am more impressed with the quality of this product.</li>
            <li>Love it works great, so happy I switched over.</li>
            <li>It works well, but it doesn&#x27;t smell so good even before you put it on.</li>
            <li>I feel good putting these simple/organic/natural ingredients on my body.</li>
            <li>I received my replacement product and it is good.</li>

            <li>So glad to have found this organic deodorant and it works great.  </li>

            <li>We are very satisfied users.</li>
            <li>I am sure you will have a great experience.</li>
            <li>So glad I discovered Island Deoderant!</li>
            <li>Nothing worked for me except this deodorant, and I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>Totally So much better than toms, no irritations not visible, and no smells!  </li>

            <li>I have given this stuff to my friends and they still love it!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>Looking forward to more products like these!</li>
            <li>I freaking love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I love this deodorant!  </li>
            <li>and I just ordered three more bottles!  </li>
            <li>I also love that it is made by someone who cares about what goes in it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>The first week after use I would ask my husband to smell my armpits quite frequently LoL and there was never any odor!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it wouldn&#x27;t taste very good though :) If you want to be adventurous, you could probably make this yourself for cheaper.</li>
            <li>Works great &amp; glides on smoothly.</li>
            <li>However, this stuff is so amazing, I&#x27;ll deal with that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy to have found an aluminum free option</li>
            <li>It is absolutely amazing, I have not been wearing deodorant but then in the summer ...</li>
            <li>It used to be amazing</li>
            <li>This stuff is AMAZING at how well it works for me.</li>
            <li>Amazing deodorant.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Product was received in exchange for my honest review</li>
            <li>It goes on nicely and doesn&#x27;t get on my clothes.  </li>
            <li>But, I wish I didn&#x27;t cause I liked it up until I broke out.</li>
            <li>Was looking for a product i can trust (no metals, chemicals etc) and is effective</li>
            <li>I would rather use my own that I made from Wellnessmama.com.</li>
            <li>In colder seasons you have to hold it under your pit for it to warm up and spread easier.</li>
            <li>I feel good just for putting it on :)</li>
            <li>Con is that the stick is kind of hard/rough when you apply it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not even that warm here yet</li>
            <li>The new formula is awesome!</li>
            <li>BEST, truly natural deodorant out there!  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s the best that I&#x27;ve found so far!  </li>
            <li>This is by far the best deodorant that I have ever used!</li>
            <li>Its the best so far</li>
            <li>So far it is working great!  </li>
            <li>This is the best natural deodorant I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>Best natural deodorant hands</li>
            <li>and I am so excited that I haven&#x27;t experienced any body odor at all, including a full day of walking three flea markets!  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m just fine!</li>
            <li>Worked just fine for my husband too!</li>
            <li>but I find if I hold the stick to my skin for a couple seconds to let it warm up it glides on easily.  </li>
            <li>This deodorant is effective, mild, smells good but not perfume-y or strong, &amp; it works.</li>
            <li>If you are thinking about ordering, take a chance--you will be glad you did.</li>
            <li>What kind of &#x27;shelf stable probiotics&#x27; can be available except the ones marketed for digestion &amp; what was the chance that was going to work on my skin?</li>
            <li>It works better than Tom&#x27;s for me.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t want too many scents to mix.</li>
            <li>It goes on nice and smooth and works better than any organic I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I have not had any staining of my clothes, though at the moment I am mostly wearing cotton</li>
            <li>Plus, the customer service is fantastic!</li>
            <li>but sometimes when I am in more of a hurry, the stick is faster to apply.  </li>
            <li>Oh, &amp; the wording on the casing labels is both informative &amp; cute...</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not an overpowering fragrance like most deodorants.</li>
            <li>I suggest working on the formula a bit more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many.</li>
            <li>I contacted the manufacture and it was replaced with a sincere apology and an explanation on what happened.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Will be buying again for sure</li>
            <li>I love this product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I am buying more as we speak.</li>
            <li>I wish I could find a more organic deodorant that would work for me.</li>
            <li>I ran across this product in my searching to go ever more organic with my lifestyle.</li>
            <li>I just see more coming off.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>so I thought that was interesting.</li>
            <li>I feel better about using it</li>
            <li>Feels like sandpaper when I use it but is ok with smell.</li>
            <li>Have purchased many times now and will continue to buy.</li>
            <li>Both of us (husband and wife) use this product and LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so safe you could almost eat it....</li>
            <li>it has an earthy smell which I love</li>
            <li>* I love this product and am ordering the 2-pack  </li>
            <li>Island deodorant is the best and the only brand I&#x27;ve used for around a year.</li>
            <li>Will be testing this out more</li>
            <li>For a $15 deodorant, I was expecting a bit more.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS DEODERANT.  </li>
            <li>It did not stain my clothes at all despite the shea butter, but I am mostly wearing tank tops.</li>
            <li>Love it, love it.</li>
            <li>if I couldn&#x27;t I would just deal with the fact that I might stink and I was okay with that.</li>
            <li>This works better and as a cancer surviver</li>
            <li>but it smells ok.</li>
            <li>but this deodarent is ok.</li>
            <li>I really love this deodorant.</li>
            <li>Ok I am torn with this product, while it does keep the smell away</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t too pleased when I heard it was in cream form.</li>
            <li>I started using this product 7 months ago and love it.  </li>
            <li>No nasty chemicals and whenever I forget to put on deodorant</li>
            <li>A healthy organic product that works.</li>
            <li>I also love that my underarm skin appears smoother than ever.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery and an AMAZING product!</li>
            <li>Thank you Jennifer for making such a great and safe product!   </li>
            <li>This keeps me odor free and I love knowing its healthy and chemical free!</li>
            <li>It works fairly well, but still needs reapplication on a hot or stressful day.</li>
            <li>Its so fresh, leaves no messy residue on your clothes, and works great!  </li>
            <li>I have been really happy with this natural deodorant!  </li>
            <li>Best natural deodorant I&#x27;ve found in terms of keeping me from smelling on hot days when I&#x27;m sweaty.  </li>
            <li>I have even told my friends who are already using natural products to look at Organic Island because I&#x27;m really happy with it.</li>
            <li>And thus ends my great natural deodorant experiment.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the aluminum free Adidas Cotton Tech deodorant which worked ok</li>
            <li>It feels very sticky going on, has no smell I can sense and works good for about four hours.</li>
            <li>and i&#x27;m good to go for the whole day without any odor.</li>
            <li>but now i have significant more body odor to contend with.</li>
            <li>It glides on without needing to warm it up at first.  </li>
            <li>really liked it at first</li>
            <li>It is fine for wearing to work.  </li>
            <li>One minute ur fine</li>
            <li>Worked fine for my son.</li>
            <li>This is the best natural deodorant I have tried so far!</li>
            <li>It goes on super smooth, soothes my skin (it seems to moisturizer without being greasy), and most importantly, IT WORKS</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m amazed, I love it so much! !</li>
            <li>Still getting used to aluminum free products (it does take a bit) but overall this is a great deodorant.</li>
            <li>Much easier and cheaper to make your own.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product</li>
            <li>I have tried every deodorant available over the counter as well as prescribed.</li>
            <li>It slides on smooth and lasts all day.  </li>
            <li>second stick is smooth and comfortable to apply and still works great.</li>
            <li>That said, it doesn&#x27;t glide on smoothly</li>
            <li>As soon as it is available again I&#x27;m planning to stock up.</li>
            <li>It works fantastic on me and my -almost</li>
            <li>I put it on lightly (about 4 swipes per armpit)</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t have a smell.</li>
            <li>So grateful this product is available.  </li>
            <li>Very effective against odor -- I&#x27;ve only needed to reapply once or twice in the 6 months</li>
            <li>I felt very fresh.</li>
            <li>Please never stop making it!&lt;br /&gt;i couldn&#x27;t live without it now!!! :-)))</li>
            <li>I believe that each deodorant is unique to each person&#x27;s body.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m revising my original two-star review.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first month it was okay.  </li>
            <li>Not bad, but it doesnt go on smooth.</li>
            <li>It also made sure I didn&#x27;t stink after my intense workouts!</li>
            <li>I do lots of hot yoga and this stuff still stands up, blocking odor and sweat for the most part.</li>
            <li>My first purchase of this was made over a year ago and felt like sandpaper when I applied it, but because it worked I just went with it and ordered more when I ran out.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I was so excited when I got it</li>
            <li>So far I am very pleased with this deodorant.</li>
            <li>So Far I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>The first day I kept sniffing under there, I thought for sure I&#x27;d have to reapply.</li>
            <li>Now that&#x27;s something to be excited about.</li>
            <li>years of trying so many different brands, finally found the perfect one.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>(he has no odor but is excited to add it to his hygiene routine for fun!)  </li>
            <li>The best thing about this one besides it works very well and lasts a long time is that is is 100% ORGANIC!!!  </li>
            <li>so far I love this deodorant and I will be sure to update my review when I have been using it even longer!&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works great, no over-powering perfumes, I&#x27;m dry and no need to carry paper towels soaked in rubbing alcohol to wipe my underarms anymore.</li>
            <li>Absolutely clean and no masking odors or perfumes.</li>
            <li>I really liked this deodorant at first, but after the first week</li>
            <li>Otherwise, you can get fuzzys from your clothes on the stick and it&#x27;s a pain to clean off.</li>
            <li>I have tried many, many natural deodorants on the market.</li>
            <li>organic, natural and most of all, it works!</li>
            <li>I am loving this so far!  </li>
            <li>so I was excited to use it to see if what everyone says was true.</li>
            <li>so I am happy this one seems to actually have my hopes very high for an affective product!</li>
            <li>Plus, I really think the pro-biotics in this one make a huge difference!</li>
            <li>I like the nice, natural smell.</li>
            <li>I really like it and have been telling my friends about it and have many of them purchasing it.  </li>
            <li>: I wrote this review over a year ago, and stand by everything I wrote -- it&#x27;s still true.</li>
            <li>Natural, extremely effective, virtually odorless.</li>
            <li>Otherwise not bad.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, I&#x27;m am so pleased with the new version!</li>
            <li>Being 30 weeks pregnant</li>
            <li>Just ordered more to make sure we have a back stock...</li>
            <li>I am so seriously impressed by this product that I just ordered another one because I&#x27;m starting to run low</li>
            <li>hot, hot, or hotter :)  </li>
            <li>I bought this deodorant because im highly allergic to the ingredients most company&#x27;s use.</li>
            <li>It keeps me odor free even during a hot Florida summer.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with the product and would recommend it to others looking for an OTC alternative.</li>
            <li>It works good as long as I am not exercising that day.  </li>
            <li>and she responded right away, wanting to make it right!</li>
            <li>Overall a great product, would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>And the new creamier formula is even better.</li>
            <li>I was fully expecting it to be less than great</li>
            <li>and it works better than old spice!</li>
            <li>I was pretty embarrassed at a work meeting when I realized that stench was ME!</li>
            <li>I am sooo happy that I finally have a natural deodorant that works!  </li>
            <li>, I need to wash up and apply a fresh coat.</li>
            <li>This is rare though.</li>
            <li>I think it  is worth the price</li>
            <li>When I used it occasionally this deodorant seemed effective.</li>
            <li>I am trying to use more natural products.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that this is organic and natural.  </li>
            <li>To be honest, I don&#x27;t like stick deodorants, and this is definitely a stick deodorant, so</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so worth to get.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many different kinds of aluminum free deodorants that its nuts</li>
            <li>Most natural deodorants will get me through about 1/2 day (sitting in an office) before I can start to tell it is wearing off.</li>
            <li>this local lady (she lived about an hour away) was creating from scratch in her own home.</li>
            <li>I love that this product is natural and my pre-teen kiddo can use it liberally</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a natural deodorant (without Alum or aluminum) that really works and this does!!!!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried different natural deodorants -- Tom&#x27;s, crystals, etc. -- and none of them were very effective.</li>
            <li>- do the right thing - tell the truth and fix the problem.</li>
            <li>I just wont shave right before applying the deodorant.</li>
            <li>but it is winter right now</li>
            <li>Smelled great but hurt to put on -- rubbed my skin raw.</li>
            <li>And really fallow the instructions when they say to put it on CLEAN pits.</li>
            <li>I am convinced that the mainstream deodorants which you find on the market are full of toxic chemicals that can adsorb into your body from the skin and eventually lead straight to the brain and others areas over time.</li>
            <li>My husband and I both tried other natural aluminum-free deodorants,  and this is far and away the best one that we have tried.</li>
            <li>Does not have chemical sticky sweet smell- just a mild natural smell.  </li>
            <li>I have tried other aluminum free deodorants, like Tom&#x27;s, and this one has worked better than all of them.  </li>
            <li>It gets pretty hot here in the south</li>
            <li>It really helps disguise odor and never stains anything of mines!  </li>
            <li>Ive had a had time controlling my pits, I&#x27;ll be seeing more trim in my future.</li>
            <li>For the middle-aged women, you&#x27;ll get this: I&#x27;m having hot flashes at night (hubby says I&#x27;m always hot,</li>
            <li>You should absolutely get it!</li>
            <li>If only more companies operated this way.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This despite the temperature rising and my sweating more outside.  </li>
            <li>I give it 4 stars because of the price ;)</li>
            <li>I use this in many different environments around the country.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much for making such an amazing product...and for contacting me afterwards to see if I was satisfied!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will admit I was was a skeptic but now a believer that you can find a real organic product that works!</li>
            <li>When I first started using it</li>
            <li>Very grateful to have found it!</li>
            <li>I ordered my first stick of deodorant in April and it is now July.</li>
            <li>I love the idea of this, but personally I just cannot stand the smell.</li>
            <li>May work in a hot climate but at 70 degrees room temperature</li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>Organic Island Deodorant is exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for</li>
            <li>I get hot at night and tend to sweat but apon waking up</li>
            <li>(I have been using for over 2 months now and would estimate that I have ~75% remaining - helps justify higher price tag).  </li>
            <li>I had actually met her, and she is a lovely person.</li>
            <li>so I can get pretty hot.</li>
            <li>Love that it&#x27;s truly organic AND actually works!  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Normally a great product, but the order I just recently received is so dry and &amp;#34;chunky&amp;#34; that it scratches my skin when I try to apply it.</li>
            <li>I switched to natural products about three years ago and have tried many natural deodorants (including making it myself)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using my husband&#x27;s Old Spice since that&#x27;s the only one I could find that is actually effective, and</li>
            <li>This project gives a great peace of mind and completely eliminates smell, it also stays on through heavy workouts.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first deodorant I found that really really works.</li>
            <li>Natural ingrediants, small business, works GREAT, no smell all day out in the hot sun and through workouts..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried numerous natural deodorants (all were top-rated too) and have spent lots of time researching which were most effective.</li>
            <li>Pretty good natural deodorant, however, I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s worth the cost.</li>
            <li>Also, I have super sensitive skin and this stuff hasn&#x27;t cause me any issues.</li>
            <li>It worked great at first, but after a few weeks of using it, my armpits turned red and broke out in a rash.</li>
            <li>The chemicals which you find on the labels of most anti-perspirants and deodorants are aluminum (linked to Alzheimers and breast cancer), parabens (linked to early puberty and hormonal cancers), propylene glycol (linked to damage to the central nervous system, liver, and heart), phthalates (linked to High phthalate blood and urine levels in women of child bearing age have been linked to a higher risk of birth defects), and triclosan (FDA classifies this as a pesticide).</li>
            <li>Great product, soft and delicate with my skin.</li>
            <li>It truly is amazing how well this works with such simple ingredients.</li>
            <li>Who wants to exfoliate their arm pits every day?  </li>
            <li>so you can&#x27;t really apply it from the container without it feeling like your taking a cheese grater there, but</li>
            <li>Only downside I&#x27;ve noticed is that it leaves a bit of residue eventually on light colored shirts but even store brand deodorant/antiperspirants do that.</li>
            <li>It really works.  </li>
            <li>Proving that the probiotics in it are really helping sometimes I forget to put on the deodorant</li>
            <li>and I have never broken out there before.  </li>
            <li>ABSOLUTELY WORKS.</li>
            <li>I am not stinky anymore, and nothing else ever really worked.  </li>
            <li>(Oh, and my teenager daughter wants to go shopping today.</li>
            <li>One light application last all day.  </li>
            <li>This one is the real deal.</li>
            <li>It works really well.</li>
            <li>really doesn&#x27;t have a smell except for the ingredients that are in it.</li>
            <li>I was very dissapointed with this product.</li>
            <li>Maybe because I was using too much, but if I didn&#x27;t use a lot, it wouldn&#x27;t have worked to mask any odor.</li>
            <li>Ive even tried to hold the whole thing under my arm, while brushing teeth, or whatever to soften it some.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a flight attendant some</li>
            <li>All in all I really like this product.</li>
            <li>but after applying the scent seems to go away fast......</li>
            <li>It works well until you start really sweating.</li>
            <li>I wanted to love this, but it was rough textured going on even when warmed and irritated my skin.</li>
            <li>Really.  </li>
            <li>and I had to stop it because it was really embarrassing...</li>
            <li>I photograph weddings in the summer heat, so I need a deodorant that works VERY well</li>
            <li>held up very well.</li>
            <li>and there has absolutely been no odor.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Organic Island Deodorant!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m set for a whole day</li>
            <li>It really was like using sandpaper</li>
            <li>It is not an antiperspirant but somehow it&#x27;s been very management</li>
            <li>and I just spend the whole day out in the summer sun.  </li>
            <li>so summer will really tell if it works.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t seem to sweat much</li>
            <li>It has a real ruff texture which I don&#x27;t really like</li>
            <li>Mine came grainy and it really scratches  my skin when applying it.</li>
            <li>I even tested it a whole week at Disney World when it was in the 90s.</li>
            <li>and I love the fact that it only has natural ingredients and does NOT irritate my skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found other natural deodorants to be somewhat effective but this is in a class by itself.  </li>
            <li>The extra $5 I spend on this stick is totally worth it!</li>
            <li>Other people do seem to love it, but it&#x27;s so thoroughly not my thing</li>
            <li>They either flat out don&#x27;t work or wear off pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>But I was a decent smelling slob thanks to this stuff.</li>
            <li>Usually have to reapply in the evening/night but the trade off for a better natural product (i.e. no aluminum) is worth it!  </li>
            <li>I found a few that were pretty good as long as you reapplied</li>
            <li>This is the first natural deodorant I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE: Full disclosure, I ended up being allergic to something in the deodorant which caused me to have a reaction similar to a chemical burn.</li>
            <li>My first impression with Organic Island is that it is completely unscented.</li>
            <li>I am in IT and there are times that I have to do some major heavy lifting and work and after a long day I feel good and don&#x27;t smell!</li>
            <li>I agree with the other reviews that this deodorant is not the most comfortable to apply, but I have noticed that not much is need to obtain required results</li>
            <li>but now my underarms stay dry and odor free.  </li>
            <li>I can name it as an underarm moisturizer, nothing more or less than that.</li>
            <li>That is more than I can say for your typical brands.</li>
            <li>If you read older reviews about grittiness going on, that was from the Shea butter which is now eliminated.  </li>
            <li>I tried this one, and it would last just short of 24 hours, which was ok given my schedule.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m super bummed because this product is the only one that I have found that keeps me from getting stinky.</li>
            <li>I, too, have tried several other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorants, but none of them worked more than 1/2 the day!</li>
            <li>The scent is pleasant and I have not experienced any odors while using it.</li>
            <li>Thanks for creating such a powerful and natural product!!</li>
            <li>It works even better than all the conventional deodorants I have tried!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend</li>
            <li>(high pH)</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>This feels like using high grit sandpaper.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want to use anti perspirant because of harmful ingredients, but this is all natural and works better than any other product.</li>
            <li>After doing extensive research last year, I have found that this deodorant is the most natural you can find on the market with no toxic chemicals and it works!</li>
            <li>I went to theirwebsite after purchasing the product to read about it a little more and they do warn you that once you start using their products your pts will go thru a detox and you may experience (and I quote)  &amp;#34;extreme stinkiness&amp;#34; but</li>
            <li>but I can happily say I was wrong.</li>
            <li>But for me it is worth the extra effort!</li>
            <li>Normally deodorant stops working on me after about 5 hours and then it gets smelly.</li>
            <li>Over the past year or so I&#x27;ve been more health conscious, because I&#x27;m at my peak in my early 30&#x27;s now and want to live as long as I can with a healthier mind and body than most.</li>
            <li>I have been using for a month and it has kept me dry and completely odor free through work, exercise, hiking, rafting, biking.</li>
            <li>At first it seemed rough and grainy and I thought it can&#x27;t be effective when so little seemed to be applied to my skin.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect it to work because I live in FREAKING PHOENIX, ARIZONA</li>
            <li>I live in Phoenix, AZ</li>
            <li>I found this Organic Island Deodorant while looking for a new deodorant for my husband.</li>
            <li>I live in Arizona and this deodorant works in all of our seasons...</li>
            <li>The deodarant turns hard as a rock and has bubbles form on top which is very wierd.</li>
            <li>Organic Island deodorant goes on very smoothly and actually works for stopping under arm odor which none of the other ones ever did.  </li>
            <li>The stick last a long time, so you really get your $$$ worth!  </li>
            <li>I was very surprised</li>
            <li>I sweat a lot, and I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Your smell at this poiunt wont be very loud however.</li>
            <li>so I will update my review if I find anything different with more delicate fabrics (once I fit back in my normal wardrobe).  </li>
            <li>/&gt;However, adding probiotics is clearly a stroke of genius, because THIS STUFF WORKS!</li>
            <li>And, wow, I was amazed!  </li>
            <li>Correct me if I am wrong, but I&#x27;m pretty sure that the USA has the most health issues out of any other country in the world, hmmm I wonder why that is?</li>
            <li>i have tried every natural deodorant out there and none of them worked for me until i found yours!</li>
            <li>Cured my body odor issues naturally!  </li>
            <li>I have found my deodorant - and to think it&#x27;s not that far away from home!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s harder than most deodorants but the little bit you can rub on does the trick right away.</li>
            <li>I strive to use as many organic products as possible and have searched for a long time for an organic deodorant that actually works.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect much from the simple list of ingredients, but I am very surprised at the effectiveness.  </li>
            <li>It has been less than 2 weeks since I&#x27;ve switched from a traditional deodorant but so far I really love this product.</li>
            <li>This product works fine for a few hours, but soon I start to feel it fading.</li>
            <li>Very high quality product that I&#x27;ve purchased several times.</li>
            <li>But the absolute lack of any odor and the organic natural ingredients are reason enough to keep purchasing this item.</li>
            <li>I have tried every type of natural deodorant on the market and none of them worked like this.</li>
            <li>As far at the natural side of it.  </li>
            <li>No heavy perfume smells.  </li>
            <li>but now I see it&#x27;s offered directly at a lower cost.</li>
            <li>So far I like this deodorant.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of natural deodorants.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a natural, aluminum-free deodorant, this might be for you.  </li>
            <li>but I could NOT find a natural deoderant that worked well for me until this.</li>
            <li>Would not waste my money again.</li>
            <li>So far I don&#x27;t have any smell coming through</li>
            <li>I have tried almost every natural deodorant offered on amazon with no luck.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this problem with all natural deodorants, not just this product.</li>
            <li>Can this be fixed?</li>
            <li>One day I went to a Bible study where everyone was raving about a natural deodorant</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin  </li>
            <li>It is a personal experience, please don&#x27;t have any kind negative feelings towards me.</li>
            <li>It is rough putting on, but I&#x27;ve found that when I am still wet from my shower is much better when applying.  </li>
            <li>Needless to say there was no way I was switching back to the deodorant I grew up using regardless of it&#x27;s natural counterpart not being very effective at keeping the stench away.</li>
            <li>I spent 20 years in customer service and they do it right</li>
            <li>But finally I found a decent deodorant that protects me in the hot Texas weather and even keeps me dry all day.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t smell good or bad, but it sure was a mess.</li>
            <li>and it protects me like no other!  </li>
            <li>I would never buy this and everyone should be aware of the rough texture.</li>
            <li>I have used this deodorant for a year and a half in Florida where it is hot and humid every day!</li>
            <li>This deodorant doesn&#x27;t actually contain live probiotics.</li>
            <li>I was assured that it was going to be easy, and that a little went a long way.</li>
            <li>-- My skin can be very sensitive to chemicals, which is why I stopped using commercial deodorants</li>
            <li>I was really excited to get this product as there are not many natural deodorants that actually work.  </li>
            <li>The only negative is if its not in a super warm and moist environment aka the shower it gets pretty stiff and hard on the skin.  </li>
            <li>It smells kind of like raw shea butter but not strong.</li>
            <li>but so far no red bumps, not even after shaving.  </li>
            <li>I went back to my old deodorant.  </li>
            <li>Definitely give this product a try if you&#x27;re looking for a natural deodorant that you can depend on.</li>
            <li>Thank you for making a natural deodorant that actually works!!!!</li>
            <li>So far I have only had to apply two swipes once a day.</li>
            <li>Not all natural deodorants are the same.</li>
            <li>I have only used natural deodorants my entire adult life</li>
            <li>I switched to natural forms of deodorant after getting multiple lymph node infections in my armpits.</li>
            <li>With these toxic chemicals listed on the labels of mainstream deodorants, I am not surprised that the public is not more aware of what they are putting on their body, because I think that the FDA has an ulterior motive by not doing the right thing and banning these substances in body products .</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m more active than usual</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell amazing like most people expect deodorant to smell (that&#x27;s because they need something to cover up the chemical smell AND the nasty BO).</li>
            <li>This deodorant is the only deodorant, natural or commercial, that I have ever used that stopped me from stinking after 24 hours of flying and running through airports.</li>
            <li>I recently decided to switch to all natural deodorants after reading about the long-term health hazards of using commercial deodorants.</li>
            <li>If everyone realized that all you need is some corn starch, baking soda, and essential oils to completely eliminate body odor, all the commercial deodorant companies would be out of business.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how it works with such simple and natural ingredients</li>
            <li>This product works well for me, granted not to the same level as an Old Spice when deterring moisture, however, I don&#x27;t have any irritation issues that I had when using traditional OTC deodorants.  </li>
            <li>I had tried everything out there in natural deodorants over the last 10 years and bought this product thinking it was going to be my last shot before I went back to the chemical stuff.</li>
            <li>She has a new formula without Shea butter, which I guess was causing the rough texture.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really want a natural product but not sure this is the ONE</li>
            <li>I have been trying to find a natural deodorant for a long time &amp; finally decided to try this one.</li>
            <li>Although this product is fairly effective for its intended use, it is very dry and grainy making application difficult.  </li>
            <li>I live in Key West and have tried other products, but none that work as well.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> and it works great.  </li>
            <li> cannot believe how great this stuff is.</li>
            <li> so I am happy about that</li>

            <li> And best of all, organic so worry free about all those chemicals that harm your body!</li>
            <li> but am more impressed with the quality of this product.</li>
            <li> Love it works great, so happy I switched over.</li>
            <li> It works well, but it doesn&#x27;t smell so good even before you put it on.</li>
            <li> I feel good putting these simple/organic/natural ingredients on my body.</li>
            <li> I received my replacement product and it is good.</li>
            <li> I just went a full 24 hours with no sweating and best of all no odor at all!</li>
            <li> Great product, thanks for being awesome and handcrafting this!</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this newer version of this Organic deoderant.  </li>
            <li> So glad to have found this organic deodorant and it works great.  </li>
            <li> great product, trying to switch the rest of the family now :)</li>
            <li> Best deodorant I have ever used, worth every penny.</li>
            <li> We are very satisfied users.</li>
            <li> I am sure you will have a great experience.</li>
            <li> So glad I discovered Island Deoderant!</li>
            <li> Nothing worked for me except this deodorant, and I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> Totally So much better than toms, no irritations not visible, and no smells!  </li>
            <li> We LOVE it!</li>
            <li> I have given this stuff to my friends and they still love it!</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> Looking forward to more products like these!</li>
            <li> I freaking love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I love this deodorant!  </li>
            <li> and I just ordered three more bottles!  </li>
            <li> I also love that it is made by someone who cares about what goes in it!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> The first week after use I would ask my husband to smell my armpits quite frequently LoL and there was never any odor!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it wouldn&#x27;t taste very good though :) If you want to be adventurous, you could probably make this yourself for cheaper.</li>
            <li> Works great &amp; glides on smoothly.</li>
            <li> However, this stuff is so amazing, I&#x27;ll deal with that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy to have found an aluminum free option</li>
            <li> It is absolutely amazing, I have not been wearing deodorant but then in the summer ...</li>
            <li> It used to be amazing</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING at how well it works for me.</li>
            <li> Amazing deodorant.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Product was received in exchange for my honest review</li>
            <li> It goes on nicely and doesn&#x27;t get on my clothes.  </li>
            <li> But, I wish I didn&#x27;t cause I liked it up until I broke out.</li>
            <li> Was looking for a product i can trust (no metals, chemicals etc) and is effective</li>
            <li> I would rather use my own that I made from Wellnessmama.com.</li>
            <li> In colder seasons you have to hold it under your pit for it to warm up and spread easier.</li>
            <li> I feel good just for putting it on :)</li>
            <li> Con is that the stick is kind of hard/rough when you apply it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not even that warm here yet</li>
            <li> The new formula is awesome!</li>
            <li> BEST, truly natural deodorant out there!  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s the best that I&#x27;ve found so far!  </li>
            <li> This is by far the best deodorant that I have ever used!</li>
            <li> Its the best so far</li>
            <li> So far it is working great!  </li>
            <li> This is the best natural deodorant I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> Best natural deodorant hands</li>
            <li> and I am so excited that I haven&#x27;t experienced any body odor at all, including a full day of walking three flea markets!  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m just fine!</li>
            <li> Worked just fine for my husband too!</li>
            <li> but I find if I hold the stick to my skin for a couple seconds to let it warm up it glides on easily.  </li>
            <li> This deodorant is effective, mild, smells good but not perfume-y or strong, &amp; it works.</li>
            <li> If you are thinking about ordering, take a chance--you will be glad you did.</li>
            <li> What kind of &#x27;shelf stable probiotics&#x27; can be available except the ones marketed for digestion &amp; what was the chance that was going to work on my skin?</li>
            <li> It works better than Tom&#x27;s for me.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t want too many scents to mix.</li>
            <li> It goes on nice and smooth and works better than any organic I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I have not had any staining of my clothes, though at the moment I am mostly wearing cotton</li>
            <li> Plus, the customer service is fantastic!</li>
            <li> but sometimes when I am in more of a hurry, the stick is faster to apply.  </li>
            <li> Oh, &amp; the wording on the casing labels is both informative &amp; cute...</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not an overpowering fragrance like most deodorants.</li>
            <li> I suggest working on the formula a bit more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many.</li>
            <li> I contacted the manufacture and it was replaced with a sincere apology and an explanation on what happened.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> Will be buying again for sure</li>
            <li> I love this product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am buying more as we speak.</li>
            <li> I wish I could find a more organic deodorant that would work for me.</li>
            <li> I ran across this product in my searching to go ever more organic with my lifestyle.</li>
            <li> I just see more coming off.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> so I thought that was interesting.</li>
            <li> I feel better about using it</li>
            <li> Feels like sandpaper when I use it but is ok with smell.</li>
            <li> Have purchased many times now and will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> Both of us (husband and wife) use this product and LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so safe you could almost eat it....</li>
            <li> it has an earthy smell which I love</li>
            <li> * I love this product and am ordering the 2-pack  </li>
            <li> Island deodorant is the best and the only brand I&#x27;ve used for around a year.</li>
            <li> Will be testing this out more</li>
            <li> For a $15 deodorant, I was expecting a bit more.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS DEODERANT.  </li>
            <li> It did not stain my clothes at all despite the shea butter, but I am mostly wearing tank tops.</li>
            <li> Love it, love it.</li>
            <li> if I couldn&#x27;t I would just deal with the fact that I might stink and I was okay with that.</li>
            <li> This works better and as a cancer surviver</li>
            <li> but it smells ok.</li>
            <li> but this deodarent is ok.</li>
            <li> I really love this deodorant.</li>
            <li> Ok I am torn with this product, while it does keep the smell away</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t too pleased when I heard it was in cream form.</li>
            <li> I started using this product 7 months ago and love it.  </li>
            <li> No nasty chemicals and whenever I forget to put on deodorant</li>
            <li> A healthy organic product that works.</li>
            <li> I also love that my underarm skin appears smoother than ever.  </li>
            <li> Fast delivery and an AMAZING product!</li>
            <li> Thank you Jennifer for making such a great and safe product!   </li>
            <li> This keeps me odor free and I love knowing its healthy and chemical free!</li>
            <li> It works fairly well, but still needs reapplication on a hot or stressful day.</li>
            <li> Its so fresh, leaves no messy residue on your clothes, and works great!  </li>
            <li> I have been really happy with this natural deodorant!  </li>
            <li> Best natural deodorant I&#x27;ve found in terms of keeping me from smelling on hot days when I&#x27;m sweaty.  </li>
            <li> I have even told my friends who are already using natural products to look at Organic Island because I&#x27;m really happy with it.</li>
            <li> And thus ends my great natural deodorant experiment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the aluminum free Adidas Cotton Tech deodorant which worked ok</li>
            <li> It feels very sticky going on, has no smell I can sense and works good for about four hours.</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;m good to go for the whole day without any odor.</li>
            <li> but now i have significant more body odor to contend with.</li>
            <li> It glides on without needing to warm it up at first.  </li>
            <li> really liked it at first</li>
            <li> It is fine for wearing to work.  </li>
            <li> One minute ur fine</li>
            <li> Worked fine for my son.</li>
            <li> This is the best natural deodorant I have tried so far!</li>
            <li> It goes on super smooth, soothes my skin (it seems to moisturizer without being greasy), and most importantly, IT WORKS</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m amazed, I love it so much! !</li>
            <li> Still getting used to aluminum free products (it does take a bit) but overall this is a great deodorant.</li>
            <li> Much easier and cheaper to make your own.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product</li>
            <li> I have tried every deodorant available over the counter as well as prescribed.</li>
            <li> It slides on smooth and lasts all day.  </li>
            <li> second stick is smooth and comfortable to apply and still works great.</li>
            <li> That said, it doesn&#x27;t glide on smoothly</li>
            <li> As soon as it is available again I&#x27;m planning to stock up.</li>
            <li> It works fantastic on me and my -almost</li>
            <li> I put it on lightly (about 4 swipes per armpit)</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t have a smell.</li>
            <li> So grateful this product is available.  </li>
            <li> Very effective against odor -- I&#x27;ve only needed to reapply once or twice in the 6 months</li>
            <li> I felt very fresh.</li>
            <li> Please never stop making it!&lt;br /&gt;i couldn&#x27;t live without it now!!! :-)))</li>
            <li> I believe that each deodorant is unique to each person&#x27;s body.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m revising my original two-star review.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The first month it was okay.  </li>
            <li> Not bad, but it doesnt go on smooth.</li>
            <li> It also made sure I didn&#x27;t stink after my intense workouts!</li>
            <li> I do lots of hot yoga and this stuff still stands up, blocking odor and sweat for the most part.</li>
            <li> My first purchase of this was made over a year ago and felt like sandpaper when I applied it, but because it worked I just went with it and ordered more when I ran out.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I got it</li>
            <li> So far I am very pleased with this deodorant.</li>
            <li> So Far I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> The first day I kept sniffing under there, I thought for sure I&#x27;d have to reapply.</li>
            <li> Now that&#x27;s something to be excited about.</li>
            <li> years of trying so many different brands, finally found the perfect one.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> (he has no odor but is excited to add it to his hygiene routine for fun!)  </li>
            <li> The best thing about this one besides it works very well and lasts a long time is that is is 100% ORGANIC!!!  </li>
            <li> so far I love this deodorant and I will be sure to update my review when I have been using it even longer!&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works great, no over-powering perfumes, I&#x27;m dry and no need to carry paper towels soaked in rubbing alcohol to wipe my underarms anymore.</li>
            <li> Absolutely clean and no masking odors or perfumes.</li>
            <li> I really liked this deodorant at first, but after the first week</li>
            <li> Otherwise, you can get fuzzys from your clothes on the stick and it&#x27;s a pain to clean off.</li>
            <li> I have tried many, many natural deodorants on the market.</li>
            <li> organic, natural and most of all, it works!</li>
            <li> I am loving this so far!  </li>
            <li> so I was excited to use it to see if what everyone says was true.</li>
            <li> so I am happy this one seems to actually have my hopes very high for an affective product!</li>
            <li> Plus, I really think the pro-biotics in this one make a huge difference!</li>
            <li> I like the nice, natural smell.</li>
            <li> I really like it and have been telling my friends about it and have many of them purchasing it.  </li>
            <li> : I wrote this review over a year ago, and stand by everything I wrote -- it&#x27;s still true.</li>
            <li> Natural, extremely effective, virtually odorless.</li>
            <li> Otherwise not bad.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, I&#x27;m am so pleased with the new version!</li>
            <li> Being 30 weeks pregnant</li>
            <li> Just ordered more to make sure we have a back stock...</li>
            <li> I am so seriously impressed by this product that I just ordered another one because I&#x27;m starting to run low</li>
            <li> hot, hot, or hotter :)  </li>
            <li> I bought this deodorant because im highly allergic to the ingredients most company&#x27;s use.</li>
            <li> It keeps me odor free even during a hot Florida summer.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with the product and would recommend it to others looking for an OTC alternative.</li>
            <li> It works good as long as I am not exercising that day.  </li>
            <li> and she responded right away, wanting to make it right!</li>
            <li> Overall a great product, would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> And the new creamier formula is even better.</li>
            <li> I was fully expecting it to be less than great</li>
            <li> and it works better than old spice!</li>
            <li> I was pretty embarrassed at a work meeting when I realized that stench was ME!</li>
            <li> I am sooo happy that I finally have a natural deodorant that works!  </li>
            <li> , I need to wash up and apply a fresh coat.</li>
            <li> This is rare though.</li>
            <li> I think it  is worth the price</li>
            <li> When I used it occasionally this deodorant seemed effective.</li>
            <li> I am trying to use more natural products.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that this is organic and natural.  </li>
            <li> To be honest, I don&#x27;t like stick deodorants, and this is definitely a stick deodorant, so</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so worth to get.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many different kinds of aluminum free deodorants that its nuts</li>
            <li> Most natural deodorants will get me through about 1/2 day (sitting in an office) before I can start to tell it is wearing off.</li>
            <li> this local lady (she lived about an hour away) was creating from scratch in her own home.</li>
            <li> I love that this product is natural and my pre-teen kiddo can use it liberally</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a natural deodorant (without Alum or aluminum) that really works and this does!!!!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried different natural deodorants -- Tom&#x27;s, crystals, etc. -- and none of them were very effective.</li>
            <li> - do the right thing - tell the truth and fix the problem.</li>
            <li> I just wont shave right before applying the deodorant.</li>
            <li> but it is winter right now</li>
            <li> Smelled great but hurt to put on -- rubbed my skin raw.</li>
            <li> And really fallow the instructions when they say to put it on CLEAN pits.</li>
            <li> I am convinced that the mainstream deodorants which you find on the market are full of toxic chemicals that can adsorb into your body from the skin and eventually lead straight to the brain and others areas over time.</li>
            <li> My husband and I both tried other natural aluminum-free deodorants,  and this is far and away the best one that we have tried.</li>
            <li> Does not have chemical sticky sweet smell- just a mild natural smell.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other aluminum free deodorants, like Tom&#x27;s, and this one has worked better than all of them.  </li>
            <li> It gets pretty hot here in the south</li>
            <li> It really helps disguise odor and never stains anything of mines!  </li>
            <li> Ive had a had time controlling my pits, I&#x27;ll be seeing more trim in my future.</li>
            <li> For the middle-aged women, you&#x27;ll get this: I&#x27;m having hot flashes at night (hubby says I&#x27;m always hot,</li>
            <li> You should absolutely get it!</li>
            <li> If only more companies operated this way.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This despite the temperature rising and my sweating more outside.  </li>
            <li> I give it 4 stars because of the price ;)</li>
            <li> I use this in many different environments around the country.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much for making such an amazing product...and for contacting me afterwards to see if I was satisfied!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will admit I was was a skeptic but now a believer that you can find a real organic product that works!</li>
            <li> When I first started using it</li>
            <li> Very grateful to have found it!</li>
            <li> I ordered my first stick of deodorant in April and it is now July.</li>
            <li> I love the idea of this, but personally I just cannot stand the smell.</li>
            <li> May work in a hot climate but at 70 degrees room temperature</li>
            <li> ;-)</li>
            <li> Organic Island Deodorant is exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for</li>
            <li> I get hot at night and tend to sweat but apon waking up</li>
            <li> (I have been using for over 2 months now and would estimate that I have ~75% remaining - helps justify higher price tag).  </li>
            <li> I had actually met her, and she is a lovely person.</li>
            <li> so I can get pretty hot.</li>
            <li> Love that it&#x27;s truly organic AND actually works!  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Normally a great product, but the order I just recently received is so dry and &amp;#34;chunky&amp;#34; that it scratches my skin when I try to apply it.</li>
            <li> I switched to natural products about three years ago and have tried many natural deodorants (including making it myself)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using my husband&#x27;s Old Spice since that&#x27;s the only one I could find that is actually effective, and</li>
            <li> This project gives a great peace of mind and completely eliminates smell, it also stays on through heavy workouts.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first deodorant I found that really really works.</li>
            <li> Natural ingrediants, small business, works GREAT, no smell all day out in the hot sun and through workouts..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried numerous natural deodorants (all were top-rated too) and have spent lots of time researching which were most effective.</li>
            <li> Pretty good natural deodorant, however, I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s worth the cost.</li>
            <li> Also, I have super sensitive skin and this stuff hasn&#x27;t cause me any issues.</li>
            <li> It worked great at first, but after a few weeks of using it, my armpits turned red and broke out in a rash.</li>
            <li> The chemicals which you find on the labels of most anti-perspirants and deodorants are aluminum (linked to Alzheimers and breast cancer), parabens (linked to early puberty and hormonal cancers), propylene glycol (linked to damage to the central nervous system, liver, and heart), phthalates (linked to High phthalate blood and urine levels in women of child bearing age have been linked to a higher risk of birth defects), and triclosan (FDA classifies this as a pesticide).</li>
            <li> Great product, soft and delicate with my skin.</li>
            <li> It truly is amazing how well this works with such simple ingredients.</li>
            <li> Who wants to exfoliate their arm pits every day?  </li>
            <li> so you can&#x27;t really apply it from the container without it feeling like your taking a cheese grater there, but</li>
            <li> Only downside I&#x27;ve noticed is that it leaves a bit of residue eventually on light colored shirts but even store brand deodorant/antiperspirants do that.</li>
            <li> It really works.  </li>
            <li> Proving that the probiotics in it are really helping sometimes I forget to put on the deodorant</li>
            <li> and I have never broken out there before.  </li>
            <li> ABSOLUTELY WORKS.</li>
            <li> I am not stinky anymore, and nothing else ever really worked.  </li>
            <li> (Oh, and my teenager daughter wants to go shopping today.</li>
            <li> One light application last all day.  </li>
            <li> This one is the real deal.</li>
            <li> It works really well.</li>
            <li> really doesn&#x27;t have a smell except for the ingredients that are in it.</li>
            <li> I was very dissapointed with this product.</li>
            <li> Maybe because I was using too much, but if I didn&#x27;t use a lot, it wouldn&#x27;t have worked to mask any odor.</li>
            <li> Ive even tried to hold the whole thing under my arm, while brushing teeth, or whatever to soften it some.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a flight attendant some</li>
            <li> All in all I really like this product.</li>
            <li> but after applying the scent seems to go away fast......</li>
            <li> It works well until you start really sweating.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this, but it was rough textured going on even when warmed and irritated my skin.</li>
            <li> Really.  </li>
            <li> and I had to stop it because it was really embarrassing...</li>
            <li> I photograph weddings in the summer heat, so I need a deodorant that works VERY well</li>
            <li> held up very well.</li>
            <li> and there has absolutely been no odor.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Organic Island Deodorant!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m set for a whole day</li>
            <li> It really was like using sandpaper</li>
            <li> It is not an antiperspirant but somehow it&#x27;s been very management</li>
            <li> and I just spend the whole day out in the summer sun.  </li>
            <li> so summer will really tell if it works.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t seem to sweat much</li>
            <li> It has a real ruff texture which I don&#x27;t really like</li>
            <li> Mine came grainy and it really scratches  my skin when applying it.</li>
            <li> I even tested it a whole week at Disney World when it was in the 90s.</li>
            <li> and I love the fact that it only has natural ingredients and does NOT irritate my skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found other natural deodorants to be somewhat effective but this is in a class by itself.  </li>
            <li> The extra $5 I spend on this stick is totally worth it!</li>
            <li> Other people do seem to love it, but it&#x27;s so thoroughly not my thing</li>
            <li> They either flat out don&#x27;t work or wear off pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> But I was a decent smelling slob thanks to this stuff.</li>
            <li> Usually have to reapply in the evening/night but the trade off for a better natural product (i.e. no aluminum) is worth it!  </li>
            <li> I found a few that were pretty good as long as you reapplied</li>
            <li> This is the first natural deodorant I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: Full disclosure, I ended up being allergic to something in the deodorant which caused me to have a reaction similar to a chemical burn.</li>
            <li> My first impression with Organic Island is that it is completely unscented.</li>
            <li> I am in IT and there are times that I have to do some major heavy lifting and work and after a long day I feel good and don&#x27;t smell!</li>
            <li> I agree with the other reviews that this deodorant is not the most comfortable to apply, but I have noticed that not much is need to obtain required results</li>
            <li> but now my underarms stay dry and odor free.  </li>
            <li> I can name it as an underarm moisturizer, nothing more or less than that.</li>
            <li> That is more than I can say for your typical brands.</li>
            <li> If you read older reviews about grittiness going on, that was from the Shea butter which is now eliminated.  </li>
            <li> I tried this one, and it would last just short of 24 hours, which was ok given my schedule.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super bummed because this product is the only one that I have found that keeps me from getting stinky.</li>
            <li> I, too, have tried several other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorants, but none of them worked more than 1/2 the day!</li>
            <li> The scent is pleasant and I have not experienced any odors while using it.</li>
            <li> Thanks for creating such a powerful and natural product!!</li>
            <li> It works even better than all the conventional deodorants I have tried!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend</li>
            <li> (high pH)</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This feels like using high grit sandpaper.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to use anti perspirant because of harmful ingredients, but this is all natural and works better than any other product.</li>
            <li> After doing extensive research last year, I have found that this deodorant is the most natural you can find on the market with no toxic chemicals and it works!</li>
            <li> I went to theirwebsite after purchasing the product to read about it a little more and they do warn you that once you start using their products your pts will go thru a detox and you may experience (and I quote)  &amp;#34;extreme stinkiness&amp;#34; but</li>
            <li> but I can happily say I was wrong.</li>
            <li> But for me it is worth the extra effort!</li>
            <li> Normally deodorant stops working on me after about 5 hours and then it gets smelly.</li>
            <li> Over the past year or so I&#x27;ve been more health conscious, because I&#x27;m at my peak in my early 30&#x27;s now and want to live as long as I can with a healthier mind and body than most.</li>
            <li> I have been using for a month and it has kept me dry and completely odor free through work, exercise, hiking, rafting, biking.</li>
            <li> At first it seemed rough and grainy and I thought it can&#x27;t be effective when so little seemed to be applied to my skin.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect it to work because I live in FREAKING PHOENIX, ARIZONA</li>
            <li> I live in Phoenix, AZ</li>
            <li> I found this Organic Island Deodorant while looking for a new deodorant for my husband.</li>
            <li> I live in Arizona and this deodorant works in all of our seasons...</li>
            <li> The deodarant turns hard as a rock and has bubbles form on top which is very wierd.</li>
            <li> Organic Island deodorant goes on very smoothly and actually works for stopping under arm odor which none of the other ones ever did.  </li>
            <li> The stick last a long time, so you really get your $$$ worth!  </li>
            <li> I was very surprised</li>
            <li> I sweat a lot, and I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Your smell at this poiunt wont be very loud however.</li>
            <li> so I will update my review if I find anything different with more delicate fabrics (once I fit back in my normal wardrobe).  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, adding probiotics is clearly a stroke of genius, because THIS STUFF WORKS!</li>
            <li> And, wow, I was amazed!  </li>
            <li> Correct me if I am wrong, but I&#x27;m pretty sure that the USA has the most health issues out of any other country in the world, hmmm I wonder why that is?</li>
            <li> i have tried every natural deodorant out there and none of them worked for me until i found yours!</li>
            <li> Cured my body odor issues naturally!  </li>
            <li> I have found my deodorant - and to think it&#x27;s not that far away from home!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s harder than most deodorants but the little bit you can rub on does the trick right away.</li>
            <li> I strive to use as many organic products as possible and have searched for a long time for an organic deodorant that actually works.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much from the simple list of ingredients, but I am very surprised at the effectiveness.  </li>
            <li> It has been less than 2 weeks since I&#x27;ve switched from a traditional deodorant but so far I really love this product.</li>
            <li> This product works fine for a few hours, but soon I start to feel it fading.</li>
            <li> Very high quality product that I&#x27;ve purchased several times.</li>
            <li> But the absolute lack of any odor and the organic natural ingredients are reason enough to keep purchasing this item.</li>
            <li> I have tried every type of natural deodorant on the market and none of them worked like this.</li>
            <li> As far at the natural side of it.  </li>
            <li> No heavy perfume smells.  </li>
            <li> but now I see it&#x27;s offered directly at a lower cost.</li>
            <li> So far I like this deodorant.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of natural deodorants.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a natural, aluminum-free deodorant, this might be for you.  </li>
            <li> but I could NOT find a natural deoderant that worked well for me until this.</li>
            <li> Would not waste my money again.</li>
            <li> So far I don&#x27;t have any smell coming through</li>
            <li> I have tried almost every natural deodorant offered on amazon with no luck.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this problem with all natural deodorants, not just this product.</li>
            <li> Can this be fixed?</li>
            <li> One day I went to a Bible study where everyone was raving about a natural deodorant</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin  </li>
            <li> It is a personal experience, please don&#x27;t have any kind negative feelings towards me.</li>
            <li> It is rough putting on, but I&#x27;ve found that when I am still wet from my shower is much better when applying.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say there was no way I was switching back to the deodorant I grew up using regardless of it&#x27;s natural counterpart not being very effective at keeping the stench away.</li>
            <li> I spent 20 years in customer service and they do it right</li>
            <li> But finally I found a decent deodorant that protects me in the hot Texas weather and even keeps me dry all day.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t smell good or bad, but it sure was a mess.</li>
            <li> and it protects me like no other!  </li>
            <li> I would never buy this and everyone should be aware of the rough texture.</li>
            <li> I have used this deodorant for a year and a half in Florida where it is hot and humid every day!</li>
            <li> This deodorant doesn&#x27;t actually contain live probiotics.</li>
            <li> I was assured that it was going to be easy, and that a little went a long way.</li>
            <li> -- My skin can be very sensitive to chemicals, which is why I stopped using commercial deodorants</li>
            <li> I was really excited to get this product as there are not many natural deodorants that actually work.  </li>
            <li> The only negative is if its not in a super warm and moist environment aka the shower it gets pretty stiff and hard on the skin.  </li>
            <li> It smells kind of like raw shea butter but not strong.</li>
            <li> but so far no red bumps, not even after shaving.  </li>
            <li> I went back to my old deodorant.  </li>
            <li> Definitely give this product a try if you&#x27;re looking for a natural deodorant that you can depend on.</li>
            <li> Thank you for making a natural deodorant that actually works!!!!</li>
            <li> So far I have only had to apply two swipes once a day.</li>
            <li> Not all natural deodorants are the same.</li>
            <li> I have only used natural deodorants my entire adult life</li>
            <li> I switched to natural forms of deodorant after getting multiple lymph node infections in my armpits.</li>
            <li> With these toxic chemicals listed on the labels of mainstream deodorants, I am not surprised that the public is not more aware of what they are putting on their body, because I think that the FDA has an ulterior motive by not doing the right thing and banning these substances in body products .</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m more active than usual</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell amazing like most people expect deodorant to smell (that&#x27;s because they need something to cover up the chemical smell AND the nasty BO).</li>
            <li> This deodorant is the only deodorant, natural or commercial, that I have ever used that stopped me from stinking after 24 hours of flying and running through airports.</li>
            <li> I recently decided to switch to all natural deodorants after reading about the long-term health hazards of using commercial deodorants.</li>
            <li> If everyone realized that all you need is some corn starch, baking soda, and essential oils to completely eliminate body odor, all the commercial deodorant companies would be out of business.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how it works with such simple and natural ingredients</li>
            <li> This product works well for me, granted not to the same level as an Old Spice when deterring moisture, however, I don&#x27;t have any irritation issues that I had when using traditional OTC deodorants.  </li>
            <li> I had tried everything out there in natural deodorants over the last 10 years and bought this product thinking it was going to be my last shot before I went back to the chemical stuff.</li>
            <li> She has a new formula without Shea butter, which I guess was causing the rough texture.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Really want a natural product but not sure this is the ONE</li>
            <li> I have been trying to find a natural deodorant for a long time &amp; finally decided to try this one.</li>
            <li> Although this product is fairly effective for its intended use, it is very dry and grainy making application difficult.  </li>
            <li> I live in Key West and have tried other products, but none that work as well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit difficult to apply to my underarms, as it&#x27;s kind of rough.</li>
            <li> It is fairly hard right out of the tube</li>
            <li> I am sweating a lot and all four of my other natural deodorant brands were failing me daily</li>
            <li> Prior to buying this stick of deodorant I used other natural brands which never worked.</li>
            <li> It also works unlike all the other natural deodorants I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> It contains probiotics, I think it may be what makes the difference with other natural deodorants I have tried before.</li>
            <li> This goes on a little dry and gritty but dries fast and leaves no residue on my clothes.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend it, I only use it now on long work days or when outside a lot!  </li>
            <li> I did have a problem with one stick that turned hard after the first use.</li>
            <li> I sweat very little and don&#x27;t have much BO to speak of, but I don&#x27;t like to smell even a bit.</li>
            <li> Some basic chemistry would go a long way here.</li>
            <li> * Long lasting --</li>
            <li> Even what I would consider normal skin scent is completely missing.  </li>
            <li> I like it ,its been hard to find a natural deodorant that works, this one has so far, its a Lil itchy at end of day...</li>
            <li> The only thing I can use is Degree Dry Protection.</li>
            <li> but over time left my skin dry, flaky and irritated.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on the natural deodorant hunt for the last few years now and haven&#x27;t found one that comes close to this!</li>
            <li> I am normally a sweaty, stinky mess when I arrive on the other end, but now I am just sweaty with a bit of eau de plane.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a long time for a deodorant that does not have anti-perspirant, because I don&#x27;t want aluminum</li>
            <li> Not sure if this is normal</li>
            <li> so I sort of have an excuse for being a slob.</li>
            <li> Very gritty and rough when applying.</li>
            <li> Works all day (roughly 8-12 hours) even through moderate exercise and heat.</li>
            <li> The only thing is it is rough putting it on.</li>
            <li> I am a permanent customer, as long as this product is made I will be a buyer:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , it does work, but after using for a few months all 3 of us developed itchy lumps under our arms...</li>
            <li> finally a natural deodorant that works… Two things i learned, do not shave before you put it on because i got an irritation but that goes for a lot of deodorants and if its cold i run it quickly under my hair dryer to soften it a bit</li>
            <li> Goes on dry with no fragrance &amp; has almost eliminated odor all day long.</li>
            <li> One thing I have noticed is that this seems a little more difficult to wash off in the shower, but perhaps that is why it works so well?  </li>
            <li> I found out that the other deodorants that say &amp;#34;Natural&amp;#34; actually still have chemicals (i.e.&#x3D;sodium benzoate).</li>
            <li> Soon enough I ditched all my other deodorants and started using it exclusively.</li>
            <li> I mean I get smelly after a few hours working in hot South Florida outside.</li>
            <li> The corn starch kept me dry, but did not stop odor.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t expect it to keep me dry.  </li>
            <li> As a man I find it does pull my underarm hair more than traditional deodorants, but it&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s painful...</li>
            <li> I apply twice a day (once in the morning and once after a workout) and it keeps me dry all day.</li>
            <li> I bike a lot, I&#x27;m always constantly active, I recently went hiking</li>
            <li> I even went up to 48 hours on a single application without showering, and working out twice (sweat), and I still don&#x27;t smell any odor.</li>
            <li> I agree, this leaves your white shirts with a dark yellowish stain.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure which species they are, but I suspect they are probably the most common types, which would be lactic acid bacteria that I&#x27;m not sure would thrive in this environment or medium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I heat it with my blow dryer in the morning for a few seconds to soften it and barely touch it to my skin.</li>
            <li> I got tired of the yellow shirt racket that main brand deodorants</li>
            <li> I was a little concerned that the baking soda would be a problem as it has irritated my skin in the past if there is too much in the formula</li>
            <li> It lasts only half a day and it doesnt wear out gradually.</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous natural deodorants (like more than 5) and have always ended up disappointed!  </li>
            <li> Not only is this deodorant friendly to the armpits, it prevents bad odor all day long.</li>
            <li> It leaves little bits after application but later on absorbs into your shirt.</li>
            <li> Other then that i have rode my bike and worked out in the 90 degree dry heat</li>
            <li> It is so hard to find a natural deodorant including this one.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve used many kinds and this one was so bad it was unusable.  </li>
            <li> and I have had trouble finding one that will last all day.  </li>
            <li> The product is extremely rough on my skin, like sandpaper.  </li>
            <li> and though it can be rough to put on</li>
            <li> It went in the garbage after three attempted tries.</li>
            <li> and I can only use it once every few days</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been adding a few sprays of other natural deodorants to cover up the smokey smell on the days I want to change it up a little bit.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to stop using it because it protects me from bad odor and the ingredients are amazing, but the product is very rough to the skin and it leaves little chunks of product after using it.</li>
            <li> This might be why so many Americans are having health issues and getting sick.</li>
            <li> but it is very mild and not at all unpleasant.</li>
            <li> (BTW, I got the unscented, because I&#x27;ve tried other brands&#x27; scented deodorants, but extremely itchy rashes have developed under my arms and have been hard to get rid of.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have noted, it is harder in colder climates and softer in warmer.</li>
            <li> it was raw and irritated with several in-grown hairs!  </li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical and thought it was a bit pricey but decided to order anyway.  </li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> Other deodorants need to be reapplied,  but we use this once in the morning and that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that for other \\&quot;natural\\&quot; sticks of the slippery type which mix your sweat with fruit.</li>
            <li> So i&#x27;m not sure the probiotics actually do anything– it doesn&#x27;t say what they are</li>
            <li> However, as other people have said in their reviews it does feel like sandpaper when applying.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;ve been alternating between this deodorant and the other one I bought, and I have yet to smell any body-odor under my pits.</li>
            <li> Unlike other products containing coconut oil, this one does not stain my clothes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve put it through the test, competed in Tough Mudder New England and go the gym 5-6 days a week.</li>
            <li> Very rough to apply.</li>
            <li> Not only does it work, but you only need a thin layer so it lasts longer.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m incredibly active and this deodorant comes through almost every time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll take it any day over the conventional deodorants.</li>
            <li> It goes on a little rough, but there is satisfaction knowing I am using a non-toxic product.</li>
            <li> but it is rather pricey when i can buy other deodorants for ALOT LESS $$.</li>
            <li> While this deodorant does what it promises, it is hard and gritty.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a five star is because it is hard to put on.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Original - I like the paste better, but I hate applying it,  so I decided to try their stick version.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve tried everything and were always let down.</li>
            <li> I hope the demand grows so the cost will go down.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that this deodorant is very rough on the skin after a few days of using it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used Jason&#x27;s or Tom&#x27;s, but after awhile I had slight a body odor.</li>
            <li> Regardless, this is better than kiss my face sport roll on, crystal roll on (though this is a close second), crystal rock (horrible), Weleda spray, Lavanila, and Thai.</li>
            <li> what i noticed is that the cleaner you eat the less issue you will have with odor.</li>
            <li> It s not super oily and does not have any scent.</li>
            <li> w/antiperspirant cause and had previously tried the (over $20)</li>
            <li> I did notice the slight smokey smell their website speaks of</li>
            <li> I tried other natural deodorants, and they would fail after a few hours.</li>
            <li> they are all dead by the time the deodorant reaches you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a deodorant that wont leave rings and doesn&#x27;t make claims that are impossible (for example, having live probiotics in a basic formula), search for the Cupcake Deodorant using the amazon.com search bar.</li>
            <li> I thought about trying to put a little water on it to make it softer but I haven&#x27;t tried that yet.</li>
            <li> m out a little.</li>
            <li> The deodorant texture looks a little &amp;#34;bumpy&amp;#34;, but this is because it&#x27;s a small-batch, handmade product.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that I live in a cold climate and</li>
            <li> it also feels a little heavy and not what i want</li>
            <li> Is not smooth in any way.  </li>
            <li> I wasted my money on this deodorant.</li>
            <li> but I do not sweat heavily *</li>
            <li> however it dried my skin out to the point</li>
            <li> I have been looking for an organic deodorant that I didn&#x27;t have to re-apply every few hours.</li>
            <li> and i noticed during that time i had very little to no odor as opposed to my previous diet</li>
            <li> i ordered another flavor and got this plain one.</li>
            <li> It might (I am not completely sure) leave a little darkening of the skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very stiff/hard and unpleasant against my armpits.</li>
            <li> However, when I started using it longer than 2 days in a raw - it caused skin irritation and redness.</li>
            <li> But, after using it for a week, my armpits were raw.  </li>
            <li> I wish it hadn&#x27;t dried my skin out so bad because it really does work for oder control.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed that even though coconut oil is the first ingredient, you can&#x27;t smell it at all.</li>
            <li> However, I was never able to find one that didn&#x27;t make my armpits itch until now.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first thinking it wouldn&#x27;t work since there&#x27;s no scent, but boy was I wrong.</li>
            <li> Maybe its because I have arm hair that retains some of the product I am not sure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed because their paste works so well for me, but I much prefer to use a stick.  </li>
            <li> There is absolutely nothing island about it :(</li>
            <li> I also had a hard time getting it on evenly.  </li>
            <li> so i don&#x27;t rub my skin too hard to get it on..</li>
            <li> so it is hard to apply.</li>
            <li> It is so hard and crusty</li>
            <li> It is hard as a rock and you literally can scrape your skin.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t pushed it, but I know it works at least 36 hours for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been sweating a lot lately.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s only 6 but desperately needed some help in that area.</li>
            <li> When I put my deodorant on after shaving it hurt and for two days my armpits were very raw and irritated.</li>
            <li> but I wish it wasn&#x27;t so thick, dry, messy &amp; impossible to wipe off if you get it on your clothes.</li>
            <li> Seriously, it was 115 yesterday</li>
            <li> It keeps me dry without all the nasty crap in most brands.</li>
            <li> It does feel a little weird under the arms, but I&#x27;ll take that for no odor and</li>
            <li> or so it dried up and was difficult to apply.</li>
            <li> had all the harmful ingredients in them i.e. aluminum which blocked my sweat glands and caused multiple painful infections prohibiting me from lifting my arm.</li>
            <li> Very hard to apply.  </li>
            <li> Very sad, but it&#x27;s too expensive to keep it just for occasional use.</li>
            <li> I tired it for the past 2 days and it WORKS!!</li>
            <li> I used to always use Secret or Degree</li>
            <li> It feels like it is irritating my skin.  </li>
            <li> , I could not even wear it because I was making myself nauseated.</li>
            <li> When it is cold, it is also hard to apply.</li>
            <li> I work out really hard and sweat a lot throughout the day!!</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t so bad, it&#x27;s just a little weird.</li>
            <li> It is uncomfortable to apply.</li>
            <li> No clumping or weird residue.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this deodorant.</li>
            <li> I sadly tossed it.</li>
            <li> However, I was skeptical it could work as well as the ladies at the study were talking about.    </li>
            <li> and I was skeptical.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for approx 6 months now and its weird</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the baking soda is very irritating to my skin</li>
            <li> 5 years ago I started getting Botox injections, approximately 20 shots under each arm every 4-6 months, painful and expensive plus toxins getting injected into my system.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend was skeptical but she has even become a believer!</li>
            <li> Maybe that is just bad appreciation from my part.  </li>
            <li> emy armpt skin started peeling really badly, it didnt hurt</li>
            <li> Smells almost as bad as B.O.</li>
            <li> Maybe mine is bad, but it was like rubbing sand paper under your arms</li>
            <li> Never tried deodorant with probiotics but hoping it will help with a bad heat rash area that I get in the summer time under my arms.  </li>
            <li> and I ended up buying one of these bad boys for myself because of the rave reviews.</li>
            <li> but this time it gave me a bad rash</li>
            <li> Did I get a bad batch?</li>
            <li> my armpits don&#x27;t smell that bad compared to before I was using this product.</li>
            <li> it was just ugly, so</li>
            <li> I would continue using it if it weren&#x27;t for the painful application...</li>
            <li> :-(</li>
            <li> Had to give it away. :(</li>
            <li> I was sadly disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Cannot use :(</li>
            <li> hate to admit this, but one application once lasted me 72 hours without showering, changing, etc.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing in here that&#x27;s bad for you!</li>
            <li> This deodorant worked well for me, but putting it on was painful!</li>
            <li> I hated the feeling of swiping chemicals onto my body every day</li>
            <li> Smells horrible, wife can&#x27;t stand it</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t walk out of my house without sweating horribly.</li>
            <li> This is awful.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Will remove any hair under your arms.</li>
            <li> While this deodorant does what it promises, it is hard and gritty.  Who wants to exfoliate their arm pits every day?  I also had a hard time getting it on evenly.  Much easier and cheaper to make your own.</li>
            <li> The deodorant clumps so you can&#x27;t really apply it from the container without it feeling like your taking a cheese grater there, but on the plus side if you scrap some with your fingers and apply it seems to work</li>
            <li> This product works well at preventing odor, however, I did develop a lot of irritation on my under arms to the point where I had to stop using this product.</li>
            <li> I strive to use as many organic products as possible and have searched for a long time for an organic deodorant that actually works.  At first I was skeptical and thought it was a bit pricey but decided to order anyway.  And, wow, I was amazed!  Not only does it work, but you only need a thin layer so it lasts longer.  It gets pretty hot here in the south but now my underarms stay dry and odor free.  If you are thinking about ordering, take a chance--you will be glad you did.</li>
            <li> I had tried everything out there in natural deodorants over the last 10 years and bought this product thinking it was going to be my last shot before I went back to the chemical stuff. What kind of &#x27;shelf stable probiotics&#x27; can be available except the ones marketed for digestion &amp; what was the chance that was going to work on my skin? But, lo and behold, it works great! Goes on dry with no fragrance &amp; has almost eliminated odor all day long. Only downside I&#x27;ve noticed is that it leaves a bit of residue eventually on light colored shirts but even store brand deodorant/antiperspirants do that. I&#x27;m happily on my 2nd tube now.</li>
            <li> Using this for almost a year and i will never go back to store bought!</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase of this stuff! It works better than Tom&#x27;s for me. I believe that each deodorant is unique to each person&#x27;s body. I used to always use Secret or Degree and I always would have lumps and welts in my underarms. Since I went without aluminum and also without anti-sweating products, I do not have this problem. This stuff does not have a scent. I prefer that because I use body scents and essential oils and I don&#x27;t want too many scents to mix. When I go hiking, it&#x27;s great because bugs are not attracted to it. It also will last all day for me!</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and an AMAZING product! I don&#x27;t want to use anti perspirant because of harmful ingredients, but this is all natural and works better than any other product. I will be ordering again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this newer version of this Organic deoderant.  If you read older reviews about grittiness going on, that was from the Shea butter which is now eliminated.  It goes on nice and smooth and works better than any organic I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I switched to natural products about three years ago and have tried many natural deodorants (including making it myself) and I have had trouble finding one that will last all day.  I found a few that were pretty good as long as you reapplied but I am not always by my deodorant to do so.  I have been using this deodorant for about five days and I am so excited that I haven&#x27;t experienced any body odor at all, including a full day of walking three flea markets!  Being 30 weeks pregnant I am sweating a lot and all four of my other natural deodorant brands were failing me daily so I am extremely happy to have found something that works.  I was a little concerned that the baking soda would be a problem as it has irritated my skin in the past if there is too much in the formula but so far no red bumps, not even after shaving.  It is fairly hard right out of the tube but I find if I hold the stick to my skin for a couple seconds to let it warm up it glides on easily.  I have not had any staining of my clothes, though at the moment I am mostly wearing cotton so I will update my review if I find anything different with more delicate fabrics (once I fit back in my normal wardrobe).  One thing I have noticed is that this seems a little more difficult to wash off in the shower, but perhaps that is why it works so well?  Other than that so far I love this deodorant and I will be sure to update my review when I have been using it even longer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product was received in exchange for my honest review</li>
            <li> I have tried every type of natural deodorant on the market and none of them worked like this. It goes on nicely and doesn&#x27;t get on my clothes.  It really works.  My husband evens uses it sometimes. So glad I discovered Island Deoderant!</li>
            <li> Great! It really helps disguise odor and never stains anything of mines!  The only negative is if its not in a super warm and moist environment aka the shower it gets pretty stiff and hard on the skin.  I&#x27;ve had the same one for months though!!!! Proving that the probiotics in it are really helping sometimes I forget to put on the deodorant and I&#x27;m just fine!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m revising my original two-star review.&lt;br /&gt;Jennifer, the owner/craftswoman of island deodorant, got in touch with me after review &amp; offered to replace the deodorant. She has a new formula without Shea butter, which I guess was causing the rough texture.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I&#x27;m am so pleased with the new version! Works great &amp; glides on smoothly. Plus, the customer service is fantastic! Don&#x27;t hesitate to try this wonderful product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original - I like the paste better, but I hate applying it,  so I decided to try their stick version. It&#x27;s definitely not the same formula.  The product is extremely rough on my skin, like sandpaper.  No joke. I&#x27;m so disappointed because their paste works so well for me, but I much prefer to use a stick.  Guess my search is still on...</li>
            <li> Ive had a had time controlling my pits, I&#x27;ll be seeing more trim in my future. Fantastic product</li>
            <li> It worked great at first, but after a few weeks of using it, my armpits turned red and broke out in a rash. I couldn&#x27;t use it anymore.</li>
            <li> I tried this after using just corn starch for several months when my oncologist recommended &amp;#34;no aluminum/commercial deodorants&amp;#34; .  The corn starch kept me dry, but did not stop odor.  This deodorant works!  I have both the stick and the cream; both work the same.  I prefer the cream  but sometimes when I am in more of a hurry, the stick is faster to apply.  I have been using this for about a year and have recommended it to several people who also have become fans.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product twice.  The first month it was okay.  The second month I broke out under my arms and I have never broken out there before.  I went back to my old deodorant.  As far at the natural side of it.  It works good as long as I am not exercising that day.  It is fine for wearing to work.  I may have just had a reaction to the ingredients.  But, I wish I didn&#x27;t cause I liked it up until I broke out.</li>
            <li> ...but I wish it wasn&#x27;t so thick, dry, messy &amp; impossible to wipe off if you get it on your clothes. Disappointed that even though coconut oil is the first ingredient, you can&#x27;t smell it at all. It actually doesn&#x27;t smell like anything except plastic. The reason it still deserves 4 stars? Because it&#x27;s ORGANIC &amp; IT ABSOLUTELY WORKS. Oh, &amp; the wording on the casing labels is both informative &amp; cute...in a personable kinda way (: Will be purchasing regularly.</li>
            <li> Feels like sand paper</li>
            <li> After doing extensive research last year, I have found that this deodorant is the most natural you can find on the market with no toxic chemicals and it works! Over the past year or so I&#x27;ve been more health conscious, because I&#x27;m at my peak in my early 30&#x27;s now and want to live as long as I can with a healthier mind and body than most. I am convinced that the mainstream deodorants which you find on the market are full of toxic chemicals that can adsorb into your body from the skin and eventually lead straight to the brain and others areas over time. The chemicals which you find on the labels of most anti-perspirants and deodorants are aluminum (linked to Alzheimers and breast cancer), parabens (linked to early puberty and hormonal cancers), propylene glycol (linked to damage to the central nervous system, liver, and heart), phthalates (linked to High phthalate blood and urine levels in women of child bearing age have been linked to a higher risk of birth defects), and triclosan (FDA classifies this as a pesticide). With these toxic chemicals listed on the labels of mainstream deodorants, I am not surprised that the public is not more aware of what they are putting on their body, because I think that the FDA has an ulterior motive by not doing the right thing and banning these substances in body products . This might be why so many Americans are having health issues and getting sick. Correct me if I am wrong, but I&#x27;m pretty sure that the USA has the most health issues out of any other country in the world, hmmm I wonder why that is?</li>
            <li> THIS DEODORANT HAS CHANGED MY LIFE.  I am not stinky anymore, and nothing else ever really worked.  Does not have chemical sticky sweet smell- just a mild natural smell.  Will never buy anything else again.  The end.</li>
            <li> It works! I don&#x27;t know why I thought it would have a scent. It doesn&#x27;t. It smells kind of like raw shea butter but not strong. It&#x27;s harder than most deodorants but the little bit you can rub on does the trick right away. I&#x27;m a dancer and I run around all night but I need to actually get close to people and obviously should&#x27;t smell! If this works for me, it should work for regular people.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried numerous natural deodorants (all were top-rated too) and have spent lots of time researching which were most effective. Nothing worked for me except this deodorant, and I absolutely love it! It goes on super smooth, soothes my skin (it seems to moisturizer without being greasy), and most importantly, IT WORKS AND IT LASTS! I&#x27;m incredibly active and this deodorant comes through almost every time. The only exception: on days that are extra humid and I&#x27;m more active than usual, I need to wash up and apply a fresh coat. This is rare though. Definitely give this product a try if you&#x27;re looking for a natural deodorant that you can depend on.</li>
            <li> I have used this deodorant for a year and a half in Florida where it is hot and humid every day! It has served me well always. No stink! I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a long time for a deodorant that does not have anti-perspirant, because I don&#x27;t want aluminum and I also don&#x27;t like the sticky residue, you know, when I&#x27;m shaving my pits the next day. I&#x27;ve been using my husband&#x27;s Old Spice since that&#x27;s the only one I could find that is actually effective, and hoping that nobody noticed (thinking, &amp;#34;man, she smells just like my dad/husband/brother!&amp;#34;).&lt;br /&gt;This deodorant is actually made by my friend&#x27;s daughter, so I gave it a try. I didn&#x27;t expect it to work because I live in FREAKING PHOENIX, ARIZONA AND IT&#x27;S JUNE AND WE ARE BREAKING HEAT RECORDS THIS WEEK! Seriously, it was 115 yesterday and it&#x27;s supposed to be hotter today. (Oh, and my teenager daughter wants to go shopping today. Maybe we won&#x27;t die.) For the middle-aged women, you&#x27;ll get this: I&#x27;m having hot flashes at night (hubby says I&#x27;m always hot, followed by my daughter rolling her eyes and yelling that we are gross), and get sweaty - which actually is sort of gross...&lt;br /&gt;So, YES, I do not have stinky BO when I wake up in the morning, AND this deodorant has no smell at all. You should absolutely get it! My daughter wanted some, too, which is a miracle - if you have or know a teenage girl, I don&#x27;t have to explain why having the same ANYTHING as her mom is a miracle.</li>
            <li> So glad to have found this organic deodorant and it works great.  This will be a regular purchase for our needs.</li>
            <li> It works well, but it doesn&#x27;t smell so good even before you put it on. When it is cold, it is also hard to apply.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best deodorant that I have ever used! For years I have tried countless different deodorants in hopes that my armpits wouldn&#x27;t itch. However, I was never able to find one that didn&#x27;t make my armpits itch until now. Not only is this deodorant friendly to the armpits, it prevents bad odor all day long. I like the nice, natural smell. It&#x27;s not an overpowering fragrance like most deodorants. I recommend this product to all!</li>
            <li> Not bad, but it doesnt go on smooth. The coconut particles are sort of rough on the skin in that sensitive area. Sometimes it crumbles...I suggest working on the formula a bit more. Otherwise not bad. The scent is pleasant and I have not experienced any odors while using it.</li>
            <li> I have had a problem with odor for about 20 years. I have tried every deodorant available over the counter as well as prescribed. 5 years ago I started getting Botox injections, approximately 20 shots under each arm every 4-6 months, painful and expensive plus toxins getting injected into my system. Every so often I would search the internet to see what else has come on the market, about 2 months ago I found Organic Island Deodorant!!!&lt;br /&gt;I have used it every day since, I need to stock up! It works great, no over-powering perfumes, I&#x27;m dry and no need to carry paper towels soaked in rubbing alcohol to wipe my underarms anymore. This product is AMAZING!</li>
            <li> Thank you for making a natural deodorant that actually works!!!! My family has a history of breast cancer and i&#x27;m trying everything i can to prevent from getting it myself. i have tried every natural deodorant out there and none of them worked for me until i found yours! Please never stop making it!&lt;br /&gt;i couldn&#x27;t live without it now!!! :-)))</li>
            <li> It does not cause irritation and does not have a fragrance. It also made sure I didn&#x27;t stink after my intense workouts!</li>
            <li> Totally So much better than toms, no irritations not visible, and no smells!  I think it  is worth the price you pay</li>
            <li> I thought this would be great based on the reviews...but it was like smearing Vaseline under my armpits.  It didn&#x27;t smell good or bad, but it sure was a mess.</li>
            <li> This deodorant has become part of my daily routine.  It slides on smooth and lasts all day.  I&#x27;ll be ordering again for the 5th time.</li>
            <li> BEST, truly natural deodorant out there!  One light application last all day.  No heavy perfume smells.  The stick last a long time, so you really get your $$$ worth!  Plus, the makers of this product are great to work with any questions or answers you may have.</li>
            <li> This is the first natural deodorant I&#x27;ve tried. I was very surprised how well it works for me. So far I have only had to apply two swipes once a day. I was fully expecting it to be less than great but I can happily say I was wrong.</li>
            <li> Not all natural deodorants are the same. I&#x27;ve tried many. This one is the real deal. It works really well. I did have a problem with one stick that turned hard after the first use. I contacted the manufacture and it was replaced with a sincere apology and an explanation on what happened. Great people that make a great product. I spent 20 years in customer service and they do it right - do the right thing - tell the truth and fix the problem. If only more companies operated this way. They have my business and highest recommendation. &amp;#34;Don&#x27;t stop buying their products.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Not sure if this is normal but The texture is grainy</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product.  Was looking for a product i can trust (no metals, chemicals etc) and is effective and this finally did it for me.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much from the simple list of ingredients, but I am very surprised at the effectiveness.  I&#x27;ve found other natural deodorants to be somewhat effective but this is in a class by itself.  At first it seemed rough and grainy and I thought it can&#x27;t be effective when so little seemed to be applied to my skin.  However, to my surprise, when I use this I smell like NOTHING.  Even what I would consider normal skin scent is completely missing.  It&#x27;s pretty amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note this is a deodorant, not an antiperspirant. I don&#x27;t expect it to keep me dry.  But the absolute lack of any odor and the organic natural ingredients are reason enough to keep purchasing this item.</li>
            <li> I was using clinical strength deodorant when I decided to try an organic one.  I sweat A LOT and this keeps my underarm odor to a minimum.  Not even regular store-bought deodorant did that for me (with the exception of clinical strength, but that one is all chemically). My only complaint is that this deodorant is very rough on the skin after a few days of using it.  I thought about trying to put a little water on it to make it softer but I haven&#x27;t tried that yet.</li>
            <li> Organic, but not a deodorant. I can name it as an underarm moisturizer, nothing more or less than that. It is a personal experience, please don&#x27;t have any kind negative feelings towards me.</li>
            <li> Amazing product! organic, natural and most of all, it works!</li>
            <li> 11/2/16- UPDATE:  I am now a regular customer. Thank you Jennifer for making such a great and safe product!   The new formula is awesome! No grit. It glides on without needing to warm it up at first.  It still does what it is suppose to do without the aggressive glide approach I found myself doing. My pits are happy!!!!!!!!  Still getting used to aluminum free products (it does take a bit) but overall this is a great deodorant. I will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> This stuff is AWSOME! I can&#x27;t use scented deodorants and clinical strength anti-perspirant doesn&#x27;t work for me. Within an hour of applying it I&#x27;m already sweating and already have odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not with this stuff! I just went a full 24 hours with no sweating and best of all no odor at all! I worked all day and I still smelled good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really doesn&#x27;t have a smell except for the ingredients that are in it. It does feel a little weird under the arms, but I&#x27;ll take that for no odor and no sweating!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never stop making this stuff!</li>
            <li> THis product works great. My girlfriend was skeptical but she has even become a believer! I do lots of hot yoga and this stuff still stands up, blocking odor and sweat for the most part. It goes on a little rough, but there is satisfaction knowing I am using a non-toxic product. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Just discovered this product at an outdoor market and I love it. I live in Key West and have tried other products, but none that work as well.</li>
            <li> Normally a great product, but the order I just recently received is so dry and &amp;#34;chunky&amp;#34; that it scratches my skin when I try to apply it.</li>
            <li> When I used it occasionally this deodorant seemed effective. However, when I started using it longer than 2 days in a raw - it caused skin irritation and redness. Very sad, but it&#x27;s too expensive to keep it just for occasional use.</li>
            <li> I am trying to use more natural products. I tried other natural deodorants, and they would fail after a few hours. I tried this one, and it would last just short of 24 hours, which was ok given my schedule. Now, after a couple of weeks or so, it works as well as my unnatural brand did. This despite the temperature rising and my sweating more outside.  I haven&#x27;t pushed it, but I know it works at least 36 hours for me.</li>
            <li> finally a natural deodorant that works… Two things i learned, do not shave before you put it on because i got an irritation but that goes for a lot of deodorants and if its cold i run it quickly under my hair dryer to soften it a bit so i don&#x27;t rub my skin too hard to get it on.. Other then that i have rode my bike and worked out in the 90 degree dry heat and i don&#x27;t smell, what else can you ask for in a deodorant.. Will be buying again for sure</li>
            <li> I love this product.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t stink and the deodorant itself has no smell. It gives me confidence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend.</li>
            <li> I was very dissapointed with this product. It lasts only half a day and it doesnt wear out gradually. One minute ur fine n the next u smell like pits. It also feels wayy too waxy like if u put peanut butter as deoderant.</li>
            <li> My husband and I were just about to give up on \\&quot;organic\\&quot; and \\&quot;natural\\&quot; deodorants and then I came across this one. No scent and no body odor. We LOVE it! Just ordered more to make sure we have a back stock...I don&#x27;t want to run out of this deodorant! We&#x27;ve tried everything and were always let down. The extra $5 I spend on this stick is totally worth it! The only complaint I have is that I live in a cold climate and so it is hard to apply. However, this stuff is so amazing, I&#x27;ll deal with that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Full disclosure, I ended up being allergic to something in the deodorant which caused me to have a reaction similar to a chemical burn. :-( I have given this stuff to my friends and they still love it! I&#x27;m super bummed because this product is the only one that I have found that keeps me from getting stinky.</li>
            <li> I have tried other aluminum free deodorants, like Tom&#x27;s, and this one has worked better than all of them.  It is rough putting on, but I&#x27;ve found that when I am still wet from my shower is much better when applying.  Thank you for making a great product. I am buying more as we speak.</li>
            <li> This is the best natural deodorant I have tried so far! There was a brief adjustment period, but ever since then I haven&#x27;t had any issues with odor</li>
            <li> Very, very effective. It might (I am not completely sure) leave a little darkening of the skin.  Maybe that is just bad appreciation from my part.  But I will keep using it.  Very very effective. I give it 4 stars because of the price ;)</li>
            <li> Best deodorant i have ever used. When i was you get i could get away with rock salt but now i have significant more body odor to contend with. I tried everything including non-organic commercial varieties. I then resorted to reading ehow which suggested using coconut oil. So when i saw this product i figured i would give a try. It is very good and has been keeping me odor free through heat and stress for a month (july nyc). I highly recommend</li>
            <li> Smelled great but hurt to put on -- rubbed my skin raw. I guess it&#x27;s just not for me.</li>
            <li> Cured my body odor issues naturally!  Also has probiotics which is what I look for in all my skin products!</li>
            <li> I often have two gym sessions per day and was worried about the increase in deodorant useage. This project gives a great peace of mind and completely eliminates smell, it also stays on through heavy workouts.</li>
            <li> I got a rash. I must be one of the unlucky ones that cant use this. Maybe because I was using too much, but if I didn&#x27;t use a lot, it wouldn&#x27;t have worked to mask any odor. I sweat a lot, and I have very sensitive skin. The only thing I can use is Degree Dry Protection. I wish I could find a more organic deodorant that would work for me. Any suggestions?</li>
            <li> I love the fact that this is organic and natural.  But, after using it for a week, my armpits were raw.  Very hard to apply.  Is not smooth in any way.  Ive even tried to hold the whole thing under my arm, while brushing teeth, or whatever to soften it some.  Didnt work.  Really want a natural product but not sure this is the ONE</li>
            <li> This deodorant doesn&#x27;t actually contain live probiotics. The reason it sometimes works is the baking soda- which is very basic (high pH) and kills all bacteria, including the probiotics this unwitting deodorant maker added. Some basic chemistry would go a long way here. Probiotics cannot survive in highly basic environments. Don&#x27;t buy this thinking that the probiotics will make you healthier- they are all dead by the time the deodorant reaches you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a deodorant that wont leave rings and doesn&#x27;t make claims that are impossible (for example, having live probiotics in a basic formula), search for the Cupcake Deodorant using the amazon.com search bar.</li>
            <li> I ran across this product in my searching to go ever more organic with my lifestyle. I&#x27;m a flight attendant some I use this in many different environments around the country. As other reviewers have noted, it is harder in colder climates and softer in warmer. As a man I find it does pull my underarm hair more than traditional deodorants, but it&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s painful...I just see more coming off. All in all I really like this product. I thought the price was steep on Amazon Prime at $15 each but now I see it&#x27;s offered directly at a lower cost. I&#x27;m now on my second container.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best! My husband and I both tried other natural aluminum-free deodorants,  and this is far and away the best one that we have tried. It works.  Other deodorants need to be reapplied,  but we use this once in the morning and that&#x27;s it. Can&#x27;t say enough about this stuff.  Love it.</li>
            <li> My first purchase of this was made over a year ago and felt like sandpaper when I applied it, but because it worked I just went with it and ordered more when I ran out.&lt;br /&gt;This second stick is smooth and comfortable to apply and still works great. I have stinky &amp;#34;nervous&amp;#34; sweat under pressure and this still keeps the stink away. Win win!</li>
            <li> I was really excited to get this product as there are not many natural deodorants that actually work.  When you put it on it feels like duct tape against your arm pits.  Feel of the product is not desirable at all.  Low scent is a plus (+1).  I&#x27;ll be going back to Lavilin.</li>
            <li> So far I like this deodorant. I&#x27;ve always used Jason&#x27;s or Tom&#x27;s, but after awhile I had slight a body odor. Not so with this one. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a five star is because it is hard to put on. Not creamy like the others. The warmer the temp the easier to put on. But for me it is worth the extra effort!</li>
            <li> Best natural deodorant I&#x27;ve found in terms of keeping me from smelling on hot days when I&#x27;m sweaty.  That said, it doesn&#x27;t glide on smoothly (I put coconut oil on my pits before slathering this on) &amp; some days when I&#x27;m sweaty all day, I need to reapply.  Regardless, this is better than kiss my face sport roll on, crystal roll on (though this is a close second), crystal rock (horrible), Weleda spray, Lavanila, and Thai.</li>
            <li> Amazing!! It lasts all day🙉</li>
            <li> I wanted to wait until I used this product for some time before I wrote a review......I have to say it doesn&#x27;t smell the best.....but after applying the scent seems to go away fast......and it protects me like no other!  I am so seriously impressed by this product that I just ordered another one because I&#x27;m starting to run low and I don&#x27;t want to run out!  Thanks so much for making such an amazing product...and for contacting me afterwards to see if I was satisfied!&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product!  I will buy again and again and also recommend this to my friends and family!</li>
            <li> I am sooo happy that I finally have a natural deodorant that works!  I have tried numerous natural deodorants (like more than 5) and have always ended up disappointed!  Organic Island deodorant goes on very smoothly and actually works for stopping under arm odor which none of the other ones ever did.  This is definitely the winner! I couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you if this product works, it will not go on. It&#x27;s like rubbing a candle on your skin. What does come off is crumbly. I wasted my money on this deodorant.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It&#x27;s the first deodorant I found that really really works. I am in IT and there are times that I have to do some major heavy lifting and work and after a long day I feel good and don&#x27;t smell! That is more than I can say for your typical brands. I will admit I was was a skeptic but now a believer that you can find a real organic product that works!</li>
            <li> Great product, soft and delicate with my skin. And best of all, organic so worry free about all those chemicals that harm your body! Looking forward to more products like these!</li>
            <li> I was recommended this product by a friend. It keeps me odor free even during a hot Florida summer. Thank you!!!!</li>
            <li> Bought it for my partner and it has worked great. Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It works well until you start really sweating. Your smell at this poiunt wont be very loud however. I went to theirwebsite after purchasing the product to read about it a little more and they do warn you that once you start using their products your pts will go thru a detox and you may experience (and I quote)  &amp;#34;extreme stinkiness&amp;#34; but what i noticed is that the cleaner you eat the less issue you will have with odor. When I first started using it I wasnt eating the best diet and then I would thru a food detox and i noticed during that time i had very little to no odor as opposed to my previous diet so I thought that was interesting. I stopped using it thou becaus emy armpt skin started peeling really badly, it didnt hurt it was just ugly, so i dont know if it was part of the armpit detox or what it just freaked m out a little.</li>
            <li> If this was also an antiperspirant it would be perfect.</li>
            <li> This deodorant is effective, mild, smells good but not perfume-y or strong, &amp; it works. It keeps me dry without all the nasty crap in most brands. It also works unlike all the other natural deodorants I&#x27;ve tried. As soon as it is available again I&#x27;m planning to stock up.</li>
            <li> This feels like using high grit sandpaper. It is uncomfortable to apply. It leaves little bits after application but later on absorbs into your shirt. However, that aside, my armpits do not smell after a days work. Absolutely clean and no masking odors or perfumes. I can&#x27;t say that for other \\&quot;natural\\&quot; sticks of the slippery type which mix your sweat with fruit. I agree, this leaves your white shirts with a dark yellowish stain. I would buy it again since it&#x27;s the only organic stick that actually works.</li>
            <li> So i&#x27;m not sure the probiotics actually do anything– it doesn&#x27;t say what they are and I&#x27;m not sure which species they are, but I suspect they are probably the most common types, which would be lactic acid bacteria that I&#x27;m not sure would thrive in this environment or medium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I sweat a ton and I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of natural deodorants. They either flat out don&#x27;t work or wear off pretty quickly. This one doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate to admit this, but one application once lasted me 72 hours without showering, changing, etc. I was working on a big project for work so I sort of have an excuse for being a slob. But I was a decent smelling slob thanks to this stuff.</li>
            <li> Goes on tacky and has zero odor and wetness control</li>
            <li> Best deodorant out there. I&#x27;ve put it through the test, competed in Tough Mudder New England and go the gym 5-6 days a week. I&#x27;m so happy to have found an aluminum free option and it works better than old spice! Great product, thanks for being awesome and handcrafting this!</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this, but it was rough textured going on even when warmed and irritated my skin.</li>
            <li> Two stars. One for organic and one for effort. This stuff has a sticky consistency. Smells almost as bad as B.O. There is absolutely nothing island about it :( I was so excited when I got it and it just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I wanted to give this product 5 stars because IT WORKS for me. However, as other people have said in their reviews it does feel like sandpaper when applying. I don&#x27;t want to stop using it because it protects me from bad odor and the ingredients are amazing, but the product is very rough to the skin and it leaves little chunks of product after using it.</li>
            <li> Very gritty and rough when applying.</li>
            <li> I really liked this deodorant at first, but after the first week or so it dried up and was difficult to apply. It worked great with both sweat and odor control.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a natural, aluminum-free deodorant, this might be for you.  It works wonderfully for me--just a liberal swipe in the morning and no smell.  Really.  I will definitely buy it again, and I like supporting a small business.</li>
            <li> I hated the feeling of swiping chemicals onto my body every day but I could NOT find a natural deoderant that worked well for me until this. Very grateful to have found it! And the new creamier formula is even better. Thank you!</li>
            <li> This product is soooooooo grainy, it hurts to use it. Maybe mine is bad, but it was like rubbing sand paper under your arms</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on the natural deodorant hunt for the last few years now and haven&#x27;t found one that comes close to this! Works all day (roughly 8-12 hours) even through moderate exercise and heat. Usually have to reapply in the evening/night but the trade off for a better natural product (i.e. no aluminum) is worth it!  I&#x27;ll take it any day over the conventional deodorants.</li>
            <li> It has been less than 2 weeks since I&#x27;ve switched from a traditional deodorant but so far I really love this product. I feel better about using it and it works! I have even told my friends who are already using natural products to look at Organic Island because I&#x27;m really happy with it. Hope it continues to work for me!</li>
            <li> I ordered my first stick of deodorant in April and it is now July. Normally deodorant stops working on me after about 5 hours and then it gets smelly. This deodorant is the only deodorant, natural or commercial, that I have ever used that stopped me from stinking after 24 hours of flying and running through airports. I am normally a sweaty, stinky mess when I arrive on the other end, but now I am just sweaty with a bit of eau de plane. Running, biking, and kayaking, this stuff holds up. I highly recommend it to anyone. Also, I have super sensitive skin and this stuff hasn&#x27;t cause me any issues. Did not stain any of the fabric on clothing (including my whites Ts!). No clumping or weird residue. I freaking love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Although this product is fairly effective for its intended use, it is very dry and grainy making application difficult.  It feels like it is irritating my skin.  I will not order it again.</li>
            <li> This product just did not work for me. I used it for about a month and I had to stop it because it was really embarrassing... I smelled like onion all day! Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this deodorant.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very stiff/hard and unpleasant against my armpits. It DOES work, though.</li>
            <li> Smells horrible, wife can&#x27;t stand it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been sweating a lot lately. My regular deodorant had stopped working and staining all my clothes. I looked on amazon and this got the best reviews i could find for an aluminum-free deodorant. I tired it for the past 2 days and it WORKS!! I am so happy! It s not super oily and does not have any scent. IT keeps me from stinking too which never happened before with aluminum-free stuff.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a natural deodorant (without Alum or aluminum) that really works and this does!!!!  I really like it and have been telling my friends about it and have many of them purchasing it.  I hope the demand grows so the cost will go down.  It is pricey but very good!</li>
            <li> I recently decided to switch to all natural deodorants after reading about the long-term health hazards of using commercial deodorants. I decided to give this product a try, as well as another all-natural deodorant called Junglemint. My first impression with Organic Island is that it is completely unscented. I was skeptical at first thinking it wouldn&#x27;t work since there&#x27;s no scent, but boy was I wrong. It&#x27;s a bit difficult to apply to my underarms, as it&#x27;s kind of rough. However, I&#x27;ve been alternating between this deodorant and the other one I bought, and I have yet to smell any body-odor under my pits. I even went up to 48 hours on a single application without showering, and working out twice (sweat), and I still don&#x27;t smell any odor. It truly is amazing how well this works with such simple ingredients. If everyone realized that all you need is some corn starch, baking soda, and essential oils to completely eliminate body odor, all the commercial deodorant companies would be out of business. Plus, I really think the pro-biotics in this one make a huge difference!</li>
            <li> Feels like sandpaper when I use it but is ok with smell. I would rather use my own that I made from Wellnessmama.com.</li>
            <li> I love the idea of this, but personally I just cannot stand the smell. Other people do seem to love it, but it&#x27;s so thoroughly not my thing, I could not even wear it because I was making myself nauseated. Had to give it away. :(</li>
            <li> Organic and works! I found out that the other deodorants that say &amp;#34;Natural&amp;#34; actually still have chemicals (i.e.&#x3D;sodium benzoate). The best thing about this one besides it works very well and lasts a long time is that is is 100% ORGANIC!!!  I photograph weddings in the summer heat, so I need a deodorant that works VERY well and this does the trick!!!</li>
            <li> This deodorant worked well for me, but putting it on was painful! It is so hard and crusty, I thought I was going to cut my armpits with every swipe. It does not have the best smell, but you do get used to it. I would continue using it if it weren&#x27;t for the painful application...</li>
            <li> Very high quality product that I&#x27;ve purchased several times. I got tired of the yellow shirt racket that main brand deodorants w/antiperspirant cause and had previously tried the (over $20) Men&#x27;s Science alternative but am more impressed with the quality of this product. Have purchased many times now and will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> Both of us (husband and wife) use this product and LOVE IT. I do Bikram Yoga regularly and the point is to sweat (at 104 degrees) so I tested this stuff one day. Definitely works and with no smell. This is really a great product and we both endorse and recommend it. Thanks for creating such a powerful and natural product!!</li>
            <li> This deodorant has grains of something in it.. Feels like sandpaper and scratches the armpits! Unusable! May work in a hot climate but at 70 degrees room temperature its like sandpaper.</li>
            <li> Its the best so far but I still sweat alot....I&#x27;ll continue to use it until I find a miracle one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for several months now. I&#x27;m happy to report it works!! It doesn&#x27;t smell amazing like most people expect deodorant to smell (that&#x27;s because they need something to cover up the chemical smell AND the nasty BO). In colder seasons you have to hold it under your pit for it to warm up and spread easier. But that&#x27;s not a big deal to me. And really fallow the instructions when they say to put it on CLEAN pits. Otherwise, you can get fuzzys from your clothes on the stick and it&#x27;s a pain to clean off. All in all, I&#x27;m recommending this to a lot of people. There&#x27;s nothing in here that&#x27;s bad for you! It&#x27;s so safe you could almost eat it....I&#x27;m sure it wouldn&#x27;t taste very good though :) If you want to be adventurous, you could probably make this yourself for cheaper. There&#x27;s tons of recipes for it all over the internet. But for the hassle of making it I&#x27;d rather spend the $12...hey, I&#x27;m not putting junk in one of the biggest gland spots in my body. I feel good just for putting it on :)</li>
            <li> Works great for me.  I have been using it for a month and have no problems with sweat or odor whatsoever.</li>
            <li> And thus ends my great natural deodorant experiment. This made me stinkier than going without deodorant at all. I was pretty embarrassed at a work meeting when I realized that stench was ME!</li>
            <li> To be honest, I don&#x27;t like stick deodorants, and this is definitely a stick deodorant, so I don&#x27;t like that about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, adding probiotics is clearly a stroke of genius, because THIS STUFF WORKS! So I&#x27;ll probably use it forevermore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing else to say. You want a deodorant that works, here ya go. End of discussion.  ;-)</li>
            <li> my sister and I switched to this deodorant to get away from the aluminum ones. it has an earthy smell which I love and though it can be rough to put on it&#x27;s so worth to get. this is the only one that&#x27;s worked! great product, trying to switch the rest of the family now :)</li>
            <li> I love this deodorant!  It works fantastic on me and my -almost a teenager- boy.  I like that we do not have to use any chemicals.  It contains probiotics, I think it may be what makes the difference with other natural deodorants I have tried before. Overall a great product, would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Would not recommend do no buy! The deodarant turns hard as a rock and has bubbles form on top which is very wierd. There is no fragrance or smell to make the deodarant pleasing. Would not waste my money again.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for years for a great deodorant and I finally found it!!!  Organic Island Deodorant is exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for and I just ordered three more bottles!  I have been sharing the product information with my friends and family!  Its so fresh, leaves no messy residue on your clothes, and works great!  Finally, a body care product that I can endorse!!!!</li>
            <li> This is the perfect deodorant! I work out really hard and sweat a lot throughout the day!! This keeps me odor free and I love knowing its healthy and chemical free! I also love that it is made by someone who cares about what goes in it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried different natural deodorants -- Tom&#x27;s, crystals, etc. -- and none of them were very effective. I tried Organic Island Deodorant based on the reviews and the ingredients. The probiotics are an ingredient that intrigued me because armpit odor is caused by bacteria, and the probiotics could counteract the bacteria. I was initially put off by the price... but I decided to try it anyway.  My findings: * Long lasting -- Still using the stick bought 6 months ago. I use 2 swipes under each armpit. An excellent value! * Very effective against odor -- I&#x27;ve only needed to reapply once or twice in the 6 months I&#x27;ve used this product * Seems to reduce sweat -- the product is not described as an antiperspirant, but it seems to diminish perspiration * Did not stain clothes -- but I do not sweat heavily * Did not irritate my skin -- My skin can be very sensitive to chemicals, which is why I stopped using commercial deodorants * Does not sting after shaving * The deodorant texture looks a little &amp;#34;bumpy&amp;#34;, but this is because it&#x27;s a small-batch, handmade product. The texture did not affect efficacy. My conclusion: * I love this product and am ordering the 2-pack  Edited to add: I wrote this review over a year ago, and stand by everything I wrote -- it&#x27;s still true.</li>
            <li> Worked fine for my son. He&#x27;s only 6 but desperately needed some help in that area.</li>
            <li> Love it works great, so happy I switched over.</li>
            <li> if you like smelling like whatever you eat then use this. it worked for a day or two now i smell like onions if i eat onions and lets not talk about what i smell like when i eat cheese and garlic but you get the idea. no deodorizing here, move along</li>
            <li> Island deodorant is the best and the only brand I&#x27;ve used for around a year. I recently went out to Death Valley @ 100+ degrees and the deodorant held up very well. It&#x27;s great to find a non chemical and organic brand that works great.</li>
            <li> So far I am very pleased with this deodorant. This is my 2nd day testing it and there has absolutely been no odor. I get hot at night and tend to sweat but apon waking up I felt very fresh. Will be testing this out more and hopefully it holds up in the summer heat. So Far I am very pleased. I have tried so many different kinds of aluminum free deodorants that its nuts so I am happy this one seems to actually have my hopes very high for an affective product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for about a month now and it works great.  No smelly armpits even when working out and sweating.  Will definitely continue to use.</li>
            <li> I have gone through countless deodorants trying to find one that would actually work for me. But finally I found a decent deodorant that protects me in the hot Texas weather and even keeps me dry all day. I never have to reapply. I highly recommend Organic Island Deodorant!</li>
            <li> it will works in a pinch but probably wouldn&#x27;t order it again.  it also feels a little heavy and not what i want</li>
            <li> Best deodorant I have ever used, worth every penny. I bike a lot, I&#x27;m always constantly active, I recently went hiking and I didn&#x27;t smell any BO whatsoever ! I&#x27;m amazed, I love it so much! ! I only need about 2 swipes and I&#x27;m set for a whole day (:</li>
            <li> It is so hard to find a natural deodorant including this one.  I was sadly disappointed.  It smelled rancid and had a grainy feel?  I sadly tossed it.</li>
            <li> I have only used natural deodorants my entire adult life and I&#x27;ve used many kinds and this one was so bad it was unusable.  It really was like using sandpaper it was so grainy.  It went in the garbage after three attempted tries.</li>
            <li> The only thing is it is rough putting it on. I don&#x27;t smell at the end of the day with two swipes! My shirts don&#x27;t stain either! Love it!</li>
            <li> I am loving this so far!  Never tried deodorant with probiotics but hoping it will help with a bad heat rash area that I get in the summer time under my arms.  So far it is working great!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> This deodorant seems to do its job. Unless I sweat a lot it is all I need for cover. I like that it does not have any poisonous ingredients in it.</li>
            <li> For a $15 deodorant, I was expecting a bit more. I sweat very little and don&#x27;t have much BO to speak of, but I don&#x27;t like to smell even a bit. This product works fine for a few hours, but soon I start to feel it fading.</li>
            <li> cannot believe how great this stuff is. i want to give it out to everyone! It is absolutely amazing, I have not been wearing deodorant but then in the summer ... well, I felt I needed to do something. This stuff is the bomb. The first day I kept sniffing under there, I thought for sure I&#x27;d have to reapply. But, I didn&#x27;t. I LOVE THIS DEODERANT.  It did not stain my clothes at all despite the shea butter, but I am mostly wearing tank tops. Love it, love it. It&#x27;s the future, this stuff.</li>
            <li> I live in Phoenix, AZ and I can&#x27;t walk out of my house without sweating horribly. I am also a fitness enthusiast and I lift weights in my garage at night when it is still about 100 degrees out (no my garage is not air conditioned) Prior to buying this stick of deodorant I used other natural brands which never worked. I would always stink. I switched to natural forms of deodorant after getting multiple lymph node infections in my armpits. I had no idea that the antiperspirant  I grew up using that my mom would buy for me had all the harmful ingredients in them i.e. aluminum which blocked my sweat glands and caused multiple painful infections prohibiting me from lifting my arm. Needless to say there was no way I was switching back to the deodorant I grew up using regardless of it&#x27;s natural counterpart not being very effective at keeping the stench away. I figured I would just suffer being the stinky girl, I would wash my underarms with a washcloth and soap when ever possible throughout the day and if I couldn&#x27;t I would just deal with the fact that I might stink and I was okay with that. I found this Organic Island Deodorant while looking for a new deodorant for my husband. He ended up buying one at wholefoods before I could suggest this one to him and I ended up buying one of these bad boys for myself because of the rave reviews. I thought 12.99 was a bit pricey but it was Prime eligible and I knew I would get it within two days so I was excited to use it to see if what everyone says was true. The first week after use I would ask my husband to smell my armpits quite frequently LoL and there was never any odor! I even bummed it one weekend in a camping like setting and after no shower for two days there was still no odor!!! I am a permanent customer, as long as this product is made I will be a buyer:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only Con is that the stick is kind of hard/rough when you apply it. I had a wedding to go to and went over my armpits with the razor because there was a littlestubble that had grown in from shaving the day prior. When I put my deodorant on after shaving it hurt and for two days my armpits were very raw and irritated. I did not deduct a star because there was still no odor. I just wont shave right before applying the deodorant. Perhaps the next batch I receive will be creamier.</li>
            <li> It used to be amazing but this time it gave me a bad rash and I had to discontinue use.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how it works with such simple and natural ingredients but it&#x27;s the best that I&#x27;ve found so far!  I finally have found something that gives me confidence that&#x27;ll it work all day.  It is not an antiperspirant but somehow it&#x27;s been very management and I just spend the whole day out in the summer sun.  I&#x27;ve tried the aluminum free Adidas Cotton Tech deodorant which worked ok but over time left my skin dry, flaky and irritated.  This works better and as a cancer surviver I feel good putting these simple/organic/natural ingredients on my body.</li>
            <li> I have been trying to find a natural deodorant for a long time &amp; finally decided to try this one. So far I don&#x27;t have any smell coming through so I am happy about that but it is winter right now so summer will really tell if it works. I don&#x27;t seem to sweat much so I like that. It has a real ruff texture which I don&#x27;t really like but it smells ok.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not even that warm here yet but this deodarent is ok. It feels very sticky going on, has no smell I can sense and works good for about four hours.</li>
            <li> I have tried almost every natural deodorant offered on amazon with no luck. Most natural deodorants will get me through about 1/2 day (sitting in an office) before I can start to tell it is wearing off. This stuff is AMAZING at how well it works for me. I put it on lightly (about 4 swipes per armpit) and i&#x27;m good to go for the whole day without any odor. I did notice the slight smokey smell their website speaks of but it is very mild and not at all unpleasant. I&#x27;ve been adding a few sprays of other natural deodorants to cover up the smokey smell on the days I want to change it up a little bit. I would suggest giving this stuff a shot. I think you will be delighted at its effectiveness!</li>
            <li> I really love this deodorant. Natural ingrediants, small business, works GREAT, no smell all day out in the hot sun and through workouts.. Unfortunately the baking soda is very irritating to my skin and I can only use it once every few days or it burns my armpits. I&#x27;ve had this problem with all natural deodorants, not just this product. This product works the best of them all though.</li>
            <li> This deodorant works as promised. Two swipes is all you need. We are very satisfied users.</li>
            <li> Finally, a deodorant that works! I, too, have tried several other &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorants, but none of them worked more than 1/2 the day! I work in an office and would be so embarrassed to be stinky by noon. This goes on a little dry and gritty but dries fast and leaves no residue on my clothes. I am so thankful and relieved to have found this! (BTW, I got the unscented, because I&#x27;ve tried other brands&#x27; scented deodorants, but extremely itchy rashes have developed under my arms and have been hard to get rid of. With Organic Island Deodorant, I have no rash, and I&#x27;ve been using for about a month.)</li>
            <li> This product works well for me, granted not to the same level as an Old Spice when deterring moisture, however, I don&#x27;t have any irritation issues that I had when using traditional OTC deodorants.  I agree with the other reviews that this deodorant is not the most comfortable to apply, but I have noticed that not much is need to obtain required results (I have been using for over 2 months now and would estimate that I have ~75% remaining - helps justify higher price tag).  Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with the product and would recommend it to others looking for an OTC alternative.</li>
            <li> Ok I am torn with this product, while it does keep the smell away and I love the fact that it only has natural ingredients and does NOT irritate my skin I don&#x27;t like the texture of it. Mine came grainy and it really scratches  my skin when applying it. I&#x27;ve tried heating it up before applying but then it just leaves tiny bits of &amp;#34;sand&amp;#34; looking texture on my pits. That&#x27;s the reason I am trying different deodorants now but I would keep buying this if it wasn&#x27;t for the sandy texture. Can this be fixed? Did I get a bad batch?</li>
            <li> Pretty good natural deodorant, however, I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s worth the cost. It works fairly well, but still needs reapplication on a hot or stressful day.</li>
            <li> This is awful. It is hard as a rock and you literally can scrape your skin.  I would never buy this and everyone should be aware of the rough texture.A total looser!!!</li>
            <li> I have tried many, many natural deodorants on the market. I had to compromise either with scent, reactivity, toxicity, or the big one, functionality. At the end of the day I felt I had to take a shower again. I stubbornly held on, rotating them, resigning myself to a life of compromise.    One day I went to a Bible study where everyone was raving about a natural deodorant this local lady (she lived about an hour away) was creating from scratch in her own home. I had actually met her, and she is a lovely person. However, I was skeptical it could work as well as the ladies at the study were talking about.    I wasn&#x27;t too pleased when I heard it was in cream form. I was assured that it was going to be easy, and that a little went a long way. I bought the jar and tried it. Soon enough I ditched all my other deodorants and started using it exclusively. It is wonderful! It works and works and works. All day, in sweltering heat, throughout the summer, this deodorant worked. It works even better than all the conventional deodorants I have tried! Probiotics, what a great idea!    When I heard that she was making a stick deodorant I jumped to get my hands on it. Natural, extremely effective, virtually odorless. I have found my deodorant - and to think it&#x27;s not that far away from home! I even tested it a whole week at Disney World when it was in the 90s. Worked just fine for my husband too! Now that&#x27;s something to be excited about.</li>
            <li> Thank you!! Works like a charm! This deodorant defiantly works!  AND best of all it&#x27;s made by a WAHM in the USA!!</li>
            <li> It definitely helped with oder however it dried my skin out to the point it was raw and irritated with several in-grown hairs!  If you have sensitive skin  I would not recommend it, I only use it now on long work days or when outside a lot!  I wish it hadn&#x27;t dried my skin out so bad because it really does work for oder control.  Just don&#x27;t plan on using it after shaving!</li>
            <li> This is the best natural deodorant I&#x27;ve found. Unlike other products containing coconut oil, this one does not stain my clothes. I&#x27;m very happy with it!</li>
            <li> I was disapointed with this product. Very rough to apply. Feels like rubbing sandpaper under my arms. Almost has a course grain salt texture. Cannot use :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE!&lt;br /&gt;Contacted seller about the consistency and she responded right away, wanting to make it right! Great customer service!! I received my replacement product and it is good. Very pleased!</li>
            <li> I like it ,its been hard to find a natural deodorant that works, this one has so far, its a Lil itchy at end of day...but my armpits are adjusting...</li>
            <li> I have been looking for an organic deodorant that I didn&#x27;t have to re-apply every few hours. This was it! I apply twice a day (once in the morning and once after a workout) and it keeps me dry all day. It goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t have a smell. I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Bought this for myself and 2 daughters...really liked it at first, it does work, but after using for a few months all 3 of us developed itchy lumps under our arms...yikes! stopped using immediately, pricey mistake, as I bought one for each of us...</li>
            <li> Best natural deodorant hands down!&lt;br /&gt;After years of trying so many different brands, finally found the perfect one.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t hesitate to try it for yourself!</li>
            <li> Its been 6 months. - So I am a man and I have lots of hair under my arms and I was skeptical. I mean I get smelly after a few hours working in hot South Florida outside. I work on boats and sometimes its 95 out and 105 inside the boat so I can get pretty hot. I can drink over a gallon a day and still be dehydrated. This product is not an anti-persperant  - BUT - It is an a anti smell agent that just works fantastically for me. It has virtually no smell and is not fragrant at all. Maybe they could add some flavor to it to spice it up? I have been using it for approx 6 months now and its weird but I sometimes I forget to use it (because I never smell) and it is still working for me the next day. Maybe its because I have arm hair that retains some of the product I am not sure. This is the best product and its all I will ever use again. I am sure you will have a great experience.</li>
            <li> Amazing deodorant.  I started using this product 7 months ago and love it.  Love that it&#x27;s truly organic AND actually works!  My daughter just recently started needing to use deodorant and I won&#x27;t let her use anything else.  So grateful this product is available.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I am amazed by this deodorant. It is the best I have ever tried. I have been using for a month and it has kept me dry and completely odor free through work, exercise, hiking, rafting, biking. I heat it with my blow dryer in the morning for a few seconds to soften it and barely touch it to my skin. There is never an oily feeling...never a stain or residue on shirts or bra. I have even skipped a day on accident once and it held up! I skipped again on purpose to test it and it held up! I&#x27;ve told everyone who will listen about this stuff!</li>
            <li> i ordered another flavor and got this plain one. it does NOT last all day in regards to wetness and odor. you&#x27;ll definitely need to apply twice a day. The smell isn&#x27;t so bad, it&#x27;s just a little weird. I won&#x27;t order this one again, but I wouldn&#x27;t be entirely upset either if it was a gift.</li>
            <li> Works great for hours and doesn&#x27;t irritate my armpits like Tom&#x27;s Deodorant. No nasty chemicals and whenever I forget to put on deodorant my armpits don&#x27;t smell that bad compared to before I was using this product. A healthy organic product that works.</li>
            <li> I have been really happy with this natural deodorant!  I live in Arizona and this deodorant works in all of our seasons...hot, hot, or hotter :)  I love that this product is natural and my pre-teen kiddo can use it liberally (he has no odor but is excited to add it to his hygiene routine for fun!)  I also love that my underarm skin appears smoother than ever.  I can shave and then apply this deodorant without any burning sensations.  Great product!</li>
            <li> I bought this deodorant because im highly allergic to the ingredients most company&#x27;s use. I like this one but it is rather pricey when i can buy other deodorants for ALOT LESS $$.</li>
