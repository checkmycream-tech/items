            <li>and I usually do not like minty or sweet tasting mouthwash</li>
            <li>This stuff is better then any natural &amp; non natural mouthwash on the market.  </li>
            <li>Great to find a natural and effective alternative to mainstream commercial mouthwashes which often contain so many synthetic chemicals and artificial colorants, alcohol, etc.</li>
            <li>Pretty intense but no chemicals.</li>
            <li>It may be great for people with all healthy teeth, but please be cautious about trying if you have any broken teeth like I had!!</li>
            <li>I really really dislike this product.</li>
            <li>As you gargle with it you can really feel it &amp;#34;working&amp;#34; in your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Been</li>
            <li>It has a nice soothing taste and after a few days of use, my gum inflammation and redness is subsiding.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;more commercial brands, it&#x27;s not sweet or cloying, just a pleasant mouth freshener without an aftertaste.</li>
            <li>I love everything about Eco Dent ultimate essential mouthcare.  </li>
            <li>If you have any tiny sores, or burns, or irritations in your mouth use this wash as directed and it will heal quickly.</li>
            <li>I also highly recommend the Sonicare toothbrush in combination with this mouthwash.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Did a breath test by licking the top of my hand and smelled it after it dried up.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is VERY minty - actually quite hot.</li>
            <li>I bought this to use for my new tongue piercing because it has no alcohol and is for oral wound cleansing.</li>
            <li>It leaves my mouth feeling fresh for a long time</li>
            <li>I do this several times a day after a quick floss and recommend same to all.</li>
            <li>This product is great when you get a cut, bite or cold sore in your mouth.</li>
            <li>I have never used a natural mouthwash but after reading the reviews, I decided to go for it.</li>
            <li>Stumbled on this product in Whole Foods and my pain was instantly relieved.</li>
            <li>and wow we can tell a difference</li>
            <li>but I want a natural product without the glycerin as glycerin on your teeth does not allow for your teeth to naturally remineralize.</li>
            <li>If you have any type of mouth problems, such as sores from eating foods with too much salt, acidity, etc., this will help.</li>
            <li>Just a small mouthful with vigorous swishing for half a minute should take care of any last minute food remnants and make your mouth feel great.</li>
            <li>He likes it because it does a good job of keeping his mouth clean and fresh without having any nasty chemicals in it.</li>
            <li>The smell takes some adjusting - it&#x27;s fresh, but with new herbs I&#x27;m unfamiliar with previously.</li>
            <li>It was very intense pain that lasted all night long until I finally thought to take ibuprofen at 5am.  </li>
            <li>I switched to this product because my essence of Listerene aroma apparently wasn&#x27;t pleasing to those close to me.  </li>
            <li>Plus it leaves your breath very very fresh feeling if you leave it in your mouth for at least 60 seconds.</li>
            <li>It gives me fresh breath and it&#x27;s not a strong taste like the regular mouthwashes that contain alcohol.</li>
            <li>I started used this product after I developed an abcess on my gum line from an infection due to a crack in the root of a old root canal.</li>

            <li> and wow we can tell a difference</li>
            <li> but I want a natural product without the glycerin as glycerin on your teeth does not allow for your teeth to naturally remineralize.</li>
            <li> If you have any type of mouth problems, such as sores from eating foods with too much salt, acidity, etc., this will help.</li>
            <li> Just a small mouthful with vigorous swishing for half a minute should take care of any last minute food remnants and make your mouth feel great.</li>
            <li> He likes it because it does a good job of keeping his mouth clean and fresh without having any nasty chemicals in it.</li>
            <li> The smell takes some adjusting - it&#x27;s fresh, but with new herbs I&#x27;m unfamiliar with previously.</li>
            <li> It was very intense pain that lasted all night long until I finally thought to take ibuprofen at 5am.  </li>
            <li> I switched to this product because my essence of Listerene aroma apparently wasn&#x27;t pleasing to those close to me.  </li>
            <li> Plus it leaves your breath very very fresh feeling if you leave it in your mouth for at least 60 seconds.</li>
            <li> It gives me fresh breath and it&#x27;s not a strong taste like the regular mouthwashes that contain alcohol.</li>

            <li> not just only amazon but online in general) because of past experiences where I have gotten stuff with almost expired dates.</li>
            <li> It leaves your tongue feeling a slight bit numb if you gargle for 30 seconds or more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it a few days</li>
            <li> I read other people say they dilute it.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice that it lasts any longer than other mouthwashes.  </li>

            <li> I had a small piece of a molar break off a few months back and have been using homemade toothpaste and mouthwash since then with no pain whatsoever in that tooth.  </li>
            <li> My dentist tells me that it helps cut down on the possibility of gum disease.</li>

            <li> office but half the price.</li>
            <li> and I can tell you OMFG that mess burns and stings.</li>
            <li> After my second time using this product, Eco-Dent, within 5 minutes I had the most HORRIBLE pain radiate through my broken molar and the corresponding tooth above it!  </li>
            <li> This dental rinse is sometimes hard to find in health food stores, but is the ONLY rinse I&#x27;ve ever used that heals small injuries to the gums, cheek or tongue within 1-2 days.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the bottles are too small.</li>
            <li> It doesn’t seem as harsh on my mouth as typical mouthwashes like Scope and Listerine</li>
            <li> so I add in a little water.</li>
            <li> It debrides, or takes away, the dead skin and cleans the spot to allow it to heal.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is the best mouthwash on the planet if you have a sore tooth. Plus it leaves your breath very very fresh feeling if you leave it in your mouth for at least 60 seconds.</li>
            <li> The flavor in this mouthwash is horrible and any freshness after is short lived. I really really dislike this product.</li>
            <li> This mouthwash is great.  It is pretty strong so I dilute it a bit and it still works great.  It leaves my mouth feeling ultra squeaky clean.  My only complaint is that the bottles are too small.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. Keeps my gums healthy with no inflamation.  My DDS approves!</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by my Chiropractor.  Great product, and I usually do not like minty or sweet tasting mouthwash</li>
            <li> I love everything about Eco Dent ultimate essential mouthcare.  The taste is wonderful.  Daily use along with my water pick and sonicare keeps my oral health 5 star!</li>
            <li> Its fantastic for any mouth infection, Canker sores &amp; gum irritation. It has Goldenseal which is anti inflammatory. I also use it to gargle when I have a sore throat. I use this mouthwash with my Sonicare toothbrush as it leaves my gums feeling great.  At a recent teeth cleaning visit, my dentist was amazed at how healthy my gums &amp; teeth looked. There was no tarter to scrape!!  ( I haven&#x27;t been in for teeth cleaning in two years ) This stuff is better then any natural &amp; non natural mouthwash on the market.  I also highly recommend the Sonicare toothbrush in combination with this mouthwash. It will leave your gums healthy and your pearly white sparkling.</li>
            <li> Love this mouthwash. Use it daily. My dentist tells me that it helps cut down on the possibility of gum disease.</li>
            <li> This is a great product to prevent mouth sores.</li>
            <li> Do you periodically bite your tongue in your sleep like I do? Well if so, then look no further than echo dent daily rinse unlimited essential mouthwash! Helps heal minor mouth irritations heal in a jiffy!</li>
            <li> It has a nice soothing taste and after a few days of use, my gum inflammation and redness is subsiding.  All the other brands I&#x27;ve tried reduced inflammation for a few hours and then my gums would look inflamed again but this one seems to be actually healing them.  Will definitely by some more.</li>
            <li> I was looking for mouthwash that didn&#x27;t have alcohol in it (because I heard that can cause problems like oral cancer!)  I found this and it seems to have a good affect on my teeth, breath, gums and mouth overall.  I don&#x27;t think the taste of the full strength is too much but it&#x27;s just right for me.  I read other people say they dilute it.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s necessary.  Do what you gotta do!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this but my husband does and he thinks its the greatest thing ever. He likes it because it does a good job of keeping his mouth clean and fresh without having any nasty chemicals in it. It also tastes significantly better than listerine or scope brand mouthwashes.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I will buy again.</li>
            <li> I was impressed with ingredients as well as my periodonist!</li>
            <li> I was and still am having bad canker sores. I have been stressing out a lot lately and in my mouth on my bottom gums is white patches of canker sores. I am very clean when it comes to my mouth and I have candida too which I know will flair up from time to time. I have been eating healthy and taking care of myself but this last bout of canker sores is hurting. I can peal the white patches off which I know you are not suppose to do but it was so bad.  I changed my Sonic tooth brush head just today. I was using it for a long time. I started this last night and I can tell you OMFG that mess burns and stings. Its hard to keep it in my mouth for the whole minute but I have too.&lt;br /&gt;I hope to do an update on the product after I am done for the week, but this burns!</li>
            <li> I rather like this!  I put it into a small spray bottle and use it in between brushings on occasion.  It tastes good.</li>
            <li> I have used different products, but this tastes the best and keeps my gums healthy. I also like that there is no sugar or alcohol in the rinse. I use it after brushing, but only once a day, before bed time for 15-20 seconds.</li>
            <li> Pretty intense but no chemicals.</li>
            <li> I have never used a natural mouthwash but after reading the reviews, I decided to go for it. Tried it just now and it&#x27;s pretty strong. Did not dilute it at all. It leaves your tongue feeling a slight bit numb if you gargle for 30 seconds or more. I can feel it working on my gums. It leaves you with a tingling sensation, which comes from the different essential oils in the ingredients. It definitely seems to be a good mouthwash. Did a breath test by licking the top of my hand and smelled it after it dried up. And there was no odor!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use Eco-Dent&#x27;s lemon-lime toothpowder so perhaps with a combination of these products I can fight off bleeding gums and tooth decay. As time goes on, I&#x27;ll give an update to see if there are any improvements to my oral health.</li>
            <li> This mouthwash is the best!  I&#x27;ve only been using it a few days and I already have seen improvements with my gums.  It is a must buy for anyone who is interested in improving their oral health.</li>
            <li> This product has a very pleasant taste. It is perfect for mornings where I&#x27;m short on time yet need to have good breath. I can give my mouth a quick rinse and run out the door. I always use it after using Eco Dent tooth powder.</li>
            <li> I am tototally impressed with this mouthwash, the best I have ever tried. No flouride to contibute to alzheimer&#x27;s and no alcohol,  absolutely healthy for your mouth. No more worries. I have never given this great a review of a product. I will be a liftime customer💜</li>
            <li> After having a crown placed, there was pain with cold liquids for 4-5 months. After an xray and 2 follow-up appointments, my Dentist informed that I may need root canal. Stumbled on this product in Whole Foods and my pain was instantly relieved. Ecodent is a small miracle in my life.</li>
            <li> Really really works !!!  Have a family member with cronic bad breath gave this to them and wow we can tell a difference</li>
            <li> I loved this product before the ingredient change. I was loyal to this product before the ingredient change but I want a natural product without the glycerin as glycerin on your teeth does not allow for your teeth to naturally remineralize. Boo to the change.</li>
            <li> Works great and tastes great!</li>
            <li> Did you decide to chew the side of your mouth instead of your food? Yes I know! It hurts! Gargle with this and it will help in the healing process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is VERY minty - actually quite hot. As you gargle with it you can really feel it &amp;#34;working&amp;#34; in your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Been using this for years - wonderful and highly recommended from our house to yours.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the cinnamint flavor over this flavor. The product itself works without the addition of fluoride.</li>
            <li> This is a great rinse.  All of the ingredients are safe to use and believe me, that isn&#x27;t easy to find!  It has a very strong taste.  Not a bad one,  just strong, so I dilute it with water before I rinse and it&#x27;s perfect.  It leaves my mouth feeling fresh for a long time</li>
            <li> I bought this to use for my new tongue piercing because it has no alcohol and is for oral wound cleansing. I made the mistake of not diluting it the first time and it was pretty painful but after diluting it-it works wonders. My tongue piercing is healing lovely, I rinse with this after every meal, and drink that isn&#x27;t water. If you develop thrush due to your piercing this stuff is great with balancing out the bacteria in your mouth, I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> It really takes care of gums &amp; teeth, as well as enabling one to follow a flight pattern more easily than not.</li>
            <li> This is THE BEST mouthwash we have ever used! I dilute it by thirds &amp; it still leaves my mouth minty fresh &amp; clean. We also use it full strength after dentist appointments for rapid healing &amp; help with discomfort. We haven&#x27;t used anything else for years!</li>
            <li> If you have any type of mouth problems, such as sores from eating foods with too much salt, acidity, etc., this will help.</li>
            <li> This has a pleasant, minty baking soda flavor. It doesn’t seem as harsh on my mouth as typical mouthwashes like Scope and Listerine and it’s especially nice for when you have a cut or canker sore in your mouth. The sore seems to heal faster with the use of this product. I would use it again but make sure you don’t pay $9 a bottle like I did. I see now that Amazon is selling it for $7.12 a bottle with free Prime shipping.</li>
            <li> Been using this for awhile now and I am very satisfied with this product. It is very refreshing.</li>
            <li> This product is great when you get a cut, bite or cold sore in your mouth. It debrides, or takes away, the dead skin and cleans the spot to allow it to heal.</li>
            <li> I switched to this product because my essence of Listerene aroma apparently wasn&#x27;t pleasing to those close to me.  I selected this one because of the reviews and I liked the fact that it has CoQ-10 and baking soda for whitening. I use this in conjunction with the Eco-Dent whitening toothpowder and have received compliments on my white teeth and a great dentist appointment. My hygienist even complimented my teeth! It has a pleasant taste and essentially I&#x27;m very pleased to have switched.</li>
            <li> This dental rinse is sometimes hard to find in health food stores, but is the ONLY rinse I&#x27;ve ever used that heals small injuries to the gums, cheek or tongue within 1-2 days.  Even heals abscesses.  And doesn&#x27;t set your mouth on fire like that famous brand-name mouthwash (with alcohol) does, so it&#x27;s easy to swish for the full 1-2 minutes required.</li>
            <li> I love this.  This makes your teeth feel so clean.  Hard to use anything else a after trying this.</li>
            <li> This is my \\&quot;go to\\&quot; mouth wash. (go to &#x3D; latest &amp; greatest!). I dilute this stuff by 50% with distilled water and it is perfect. Just a small mouthful with vigorous swishing for half a minute should take care of any last minute food remnants and make your mouth feel great. I do this several times a day after a quick floss and recommend same to all. (cinnamon also good!)</li>
            <li> It leaves my breath clean and fresh. I also feel like it gives your teeth a nice protective coating. They almost feel waxy after use.</li>
            <li> Love the product for its effectiveness, but because it is natural!</li>
            <li> The best mouthwash rinse you can get. Highly recommend it. I&#x27;ve been avoiding synthetic chemicals and this mouthwash definitely meets the criteria.</li>
            <li> This is the most effective mouth rinse, bar none.  The cost is usually prohibitive in shops, so it is nice to get it for a little less.</li>
            <li> I purchased a bottle of Eco-Dent at a local food co-op in hopes that it would help aid in gum restoration and my overall oral health.  I had a small piece of a molar break off a few months back and have been using homemade toothpaste and mouthwash since then with no pain whatsoever in that tooth.  After my second time using this product, Eco-Dent, within 5 minutes I had the most HORRIBLE pain radiate through my broken molar and the corresponding tooth above it!  It was very intense pain that lasted all night long until I finally thought to take ibuprofen at 5am.  I called the dentist the next day and have had my tooth taken care of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously, I will not be using this mouthwash again.  It may be great for people with all healthy teeth, but please be cautious about trying if you have any broken teeth like I had!!</li>
            <li> Teeth really feel clean after using this. Also, breath greatly improved. The smell takes some adjusting - it&#x27;s fresh, but with new herbs I&#x27;m unfamiliar with previously. But the gums feel a lot healthier, too. Great to find a natural and effective alternative to mainstream commercial mouthwashes which often contain so many synthetic chemicals and artificial colorants, alcohol, etc.</li>
            <li> This is a great and natural mouthwash. It is very strong so I add in a little water. Works great after brushing with the toothpowder.</li>
            <li> This is comparable to another mouthwash in price and effectiveness. I would recommend this for anyone trying to maintain freshness and reducing potential cavities.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for many years. If you have any tiny sores, or burns, or irritations in your mouth use this wash as directed and it will heal quickly. It keeps my gums healthy and strong - I use it every day after brushing.</li>
            <li> A very good mouth wash, preferable to&lt;br /&gt;more commercial brands, it&#x27;s not sweet or cloying, just a pleasant mouth freshener without an aftertaste. I use it in the am and pm.</li>
            <li> I just got this mouthwash from amazon.com today and I am so happy with my decision to purchase it. It gives me fresh breath and it&#x27;s not a strong taste like the regular mouthwashes that contain alcohol. I will definitely purchase this again when i run out. The expiration date is 2014 so hurray for that too. I am always paranoid about expiration date of stuff from amazon(but not just only amazon but online in general) because of past experiences where I have gotten stuff with almost expired dates.</li>
            <li> Very nice product and a nice taste.  Most important to me is that it is cruelty free.</li>
            <li> I started used this product after I developed an abcess on my gum line from an infection due to a crack in the root of a old root canal. Although there is nothing that can be both except extraction, I have found that Eco-Dent has removed all inflammation and odor. For now it&#x27;s doing the trick, plus my teeth are whiter!</li>
            <li> Due to allergy to corn and corn products I can no longer use regular mouthwash. This Eco-Dent Rinse is great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, not the best or as good as I was expecting from the other reviews I guess.  I don&#x27;t notice that it lasts any longer than other mouthwashes.  I&#x27;ll keep using it for now because I do like the brand and that it is a neutral product.</li>
            <li> Excellent mouth rinse for occasional use.</li>
            <li> I looked for this product at my local organic market but sadly they only carried a much smaller size. This was a true bargain, I couldn&#x27;t pass it up. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Eco Dent daily rinse is so good. your mouth feels so clean. No irradiation to your gums.</li>
            <li> Excellent. Tastes great and is an intral part of my oral health regimen</li>
            <li> Just like the Drs. office but half the price.</li>
            <li> Another purchase for the wife, seems to like it</li>
