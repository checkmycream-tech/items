            <li>This product work great.</li>
            <li>decided to try the produce and because of the great service I received,  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Aveda Invati product line (shampoo, conditioner, revitalizer) for over a month and have experienced a noticeable thinning in my front hairline, which is where I&#x27;ve been applying the revitalizer.</li>
            <li>Just great I&#x27;ve used it before</li>
            <li>What I find amazing is that it has helped my scalp a great deal.</li>
            <li>The Aveda Hair Care System is superior to others I have tried.</li>
            <li>but my hair looks good.</li>
            <li>On what planet would something flammable be good for your scalp?</li>
            <li>I will say it does look very healthy.  </li>
            <li>My hair looked very healthy..</li>
            <li>Nice stuff, good smell too.</li>
            <li>I have heard amazing things about this product from both men and women.  </li>
            <li>Conditioner - nice texture, spreads evenly, has a nice smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The scent goes on a bit strong but it fades as your hair dries to a pleasant herbal scent.  </li>
            <li>The odor is very strong..</li>
            <li>To be honest, I had much better results with the Pantene AgeDefy thickening treatment...which was a fraction of the price.  </li>
            <li>Interesting, but nice, smell.</li>
            <li>So I was glad when I found out that they now carry a line for thinning hair.  </li>
            <li>However, I can&#x27;t understand why Amazon is charging so much more for a product that routinely retails for $60.  </li>
            <li>I was expecting so much more from these products...</li>
            <li>My hair has not be so healthy in years.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for a bit over a month and have enjoyed the stimulating feeling when applying to my scalp but have notice a healthier and increased volume.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so pleased I pinch myself every time I comb through my hair.</li>
            <li>I have been using all three Invati products and have confidently</li>
            <li>As most reviewers say, this product</li>
            <li>many shampoos</li>
            <li>hairs keep growing, and my hair looks and feels healthy and youthful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>a healthy lifestyle help my hair look</li>
            <li>in looking and being healthy at any age.  </li>
            <li>in looking and being healthy at any age.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>the product does make my scalp feel better.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>Much better condition</li>
            <li>Since I have started the Invati system, I have noticed that my hair feels thicker to the touch (my ponytail feels more like it used to)</li>
            <li>and I have more body and bounce in my hair.  </li>
            <li>I will try to post again after some more time using the product.</li>
            <li>I was glad that</li>
            <li>This has worked better than rogaine for both my husband and myself.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s magic.</li>
            <li>Better than when I started to lose.&lt;br</li>
            <li>plus it&#x27;s actually ok</li>
            <li>Although Aveda smells good &amp; has a great reputation, this product fell short.</li>
            <li>I am sure not everyone would react to the smell of this product as I did</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>If I you go more than 1 day without washing your hair it will start to mat up on your scalp.</li>
            <li>This has an overwhelming.</li>
            <li>Thankfully my hair and scalp are recovering, and in most places growing back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t able to sleep because of the strong odor.  </li>
            <li>Better yet, get a free sample if you can.  </li>
            <li>It so far is giving me great</li>
            <li>and it dries very quickly.  </li>
            <li>Think about it - how could something where the main ingredient is &amp;#34;denatured alcohol&amp;#34; be good for your scalp?  </li>
            <li>As another reviewer stated, the smell of this product is horribly strong....</li>
            <li>It goes on a bit strong but as it dries it fades.  </li>
            <li>anyone using this product for a while experienced something similar?</li>
            <li>Reminds me of a cheap man&#x27;s cologne.</li>
            <li>I did not find this as effective as the bottle that I purchased straight from an Aveda salon.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve learned that you get what you pay for, and Aveda products are so good for your hair plus made from natural ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>So by using this natural product it creates the ideal climate for hair health and new growth.</li>
            <li>It was very sticky, made my roots incredibly greasy, and mind you, I don&#x27;t have oily hair, quite the opposite.</li>
            <li>(mine was in a large mall, and many salons carry the line) to buy this-</li>
            <li>If Aveda can reformulate to reduce the intensity of the odor, I would most certainly try this product again.</li>
            <li>It says right on the bottle, flammable!</li>
            <li>I love this product and have been using it for the past six months with great results.  </li>
            <li>I was given a full explanation and demonstration.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I now turn the shower to cool water for those procedures.&lt;br /&gt; 2.  </li>
            <li>Had so much better results with much cheaper products.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if the seller dilluted it or something, but when bought this from a legit salon it seems much more potent and really does help reduce shedding and breakage while letting new hair grow in.  </li>
            <li>I started the Mirena IUD in June and started getting the side effect of losing hair quickly.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noted any more than normal hair loss in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not hurting and it provides a good excuse for me to give myself a head massage.</li>
            <li>his slowed down greatly again.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this system and products, worth the price, and am getting more when I run out.  </li>
            <li>Thanks you Aveda!!</li>
            <li>After about 6 months of using this product my hair is full and thick and gorgeous again!</li>
            <li>any kind of a rubber band to tie hair back, even the ones that are</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li>So far, I am very impressed with this product, but I&#x27;ve only used it for a very short period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Invati by Aveda has worked an absolute miracle on my hair!</li>
            <li>I shared&lt;br /&gt;the same dilemma as many women my age...</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use hot shower water to shampoo</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference in my hair the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li>It actually looks and feels healthy.  </li>
            <li>Much luck to all!  </li>
            <li>One of the first ingredients is alcohol.</li>
            <li>I used vitamin E-oil on my scalp and it&#x27;s looking much healthier!</li>
            <li>The first use of this product produced immediate relief and after using up the sample over a period of 3 weeks, I ordered, again.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Just a warning - and I heard from an Aveda hairdresser that I am not the first person she has heard this from.</li>
            <li>I was very concerned about my suddenly thinning hair and tried many products to address this concern.</li>
            <li>Ultimately, if this stuff really works for me, I&#x27;d love for the world to see it and for there to be tangible evidence that hair growth as achieved (although this is not claimed by them as an effect).  </li>
            <li>The scent of this product is so strong and so repulsive that I was not able to use it more that a couple of times.  </li>
            <li>The improvements have come slowly and there&#x27;s still a ways to go, but she&#x27;s happy with the product despite the high price.</li>
            <li>I am very sensitive to smells and personally don&#x27;t like the smell of most of the Aveda products anyway,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best product I&#x27;ve ever used for fine hair that is a little thin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;which is a very flattering hairstyle for my age group.  </li>
            <li>very heavy/spicy.  </li>
            <li>Your advice would be much appreciated.</li>
            <li>The whole Invati system.  </li>
            <li>It has really helped me.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really notice the smell of the system anymore except when I am using</li>
            <li>My hair looked and felt much thicker.  </li>
            <li>I used the product at night, and in the morning just wet my hair, and as I did I thought \\&quot;this is where the magic goes away\\</li>
            <li>I couldnt bring myself to spring for the whole line.</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t like the smell so much</li>
            <li>Buy the whole system; shampoo, conditioner, styling products and revitalizer.</li>
            <li>but I do think it is an unusually unflattering fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I am getting ready to try the Phylia de M. line.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t really rate the product yet, since I haven&#x27;t tried it.</li>
            <li>Does this stuff really make your hair thicker?</li>
            <li>Does it really keep your hair from falling out?</li>
            <li>Does it really revitalize the scalp?</li>
            <li>The system really does what it is intended to do.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I reasoned that my hair was \\&quot;adjusting\\&quot; to the whole system.</li>
            <li>Apparently the turmeric may be too strong for the sensitive types.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of Aveda products, especially since I have dry, fine hair.  </li>
            <li>I have concerned with a batch of hair loss at the top of my head due to my stress and genetic reasons.  </li>
            <li>I am now back to using a regular sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner and they provide a much better effect that this very overpriced product.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use the full amount that they recommend, only about 8 sprays day and night</li>
            <li>Glad I broke down and purchased it.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m beginning to see new hairs growing in my hairline!  </li>
            <li>or I&#x27;ve use a lot of styling products to make it look halfway decent.  </li>
            <li>Someone told me about it and all the rave reviews, one in particular that takes Arthritis medication and has hair loss peeked my interest</li>
            <li>Had really high hopes for this line...read about and researched before it came out.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I hope other users sense of smell is not as sensitive as mine and you have better luck with the product.  </li>
            <li>So far I have been using this product (and the whole line) for 2 1/2 months with no discernible results.  </li>
            <li>My hair, while still full and long, has taken a beating after having my son and work-related stress.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure the heavy fragrance does not help matters either.  </li>
            <li>(less gray more of her natural color) and some reversal of hair thinning.</li>
            <li>but if I went more than a dry, it made my hair feel gross.  </li>
            <li>I can actually see fine hairs growing again, and I&#x27;ve only been using it a month.  </li>
            <li>(The shampoo I can live with.)  </li>
            <li>So if you are going to try these products - get the smaller bottles first.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re interested in following my story, I&#x27;m doing weekly blog posts with pictures to show the results.  </li>
            <li>an Aveda scam as far as I&#x27;m concerned!</li>
            <li>Had significant hair loss and the evidence is that after hair washing their is much less hair in the drain area.</li>
            <li>It really works and clearly see a big improvement in hair thickness.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Scalp revitalizer - this was my least favorite product of them all.  </li>
            <li>Now 4 months in those short hairs have remained and are much longer.  </li>
            <li>I use the complete system, from shampoo, conditioner, and the scalp revitalizer.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in the over 60 year old</li>
            <li>The smell is far nicer</li>
            <li>It is very transparent to me and do not notice anything different after using it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have naturally oily hair as well</li>
            <li>If you want to spend this much money,  I suggest improving your diet, massage your scalp with an inexpensive oil such as Sesame, use gentle products, and give anything left over to someone in need.</li>
            <li>So far, my hair has almost completely ceased falling out</li>
            <li>so far-</li>
            <li>I never write reviews but this product will do some damage if you have a sensitive scalp.</li>
            <li>Yes, I fell for it, and it angers me that I was taken by a complete scam.</li>
            <li>Here is why:  the box was completely disfigured and looked like someone had literally stepped on it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a number of products, natural and pharmaceutical, to stop the irritation and flaking on my scalp.</li>
            <li>The nozzle on this version helps to deliver the product directly to the scalp, which makes application even easier.</li>
            <li>No price difference on Amazon, so my advice is to purchase directly from Aveda.</li>
            <li>I only use the scalp revitalizer and pair it with other sulfate free shampoos and conditioners (wen, dermorganics, etc.)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not only is my hair stronger, new hair is growing!</li>
            <li>Although I have fine hair and it tends to look thinner in the winter months, it usually fills out by summer.</li>
            <li>The price point is a bit high, but I got off Rogaine, started using this, and have immediately seen some big changes.  </li>
            <li>Once daily, after pulling my hair into a high bun, I spritz the product in 12 or so locations at the scalp and massage in.</li>
            <li>Not a bad smell in general but not one I associate with myself (and absolutely not so much that someone would think I&#x27;d spilled an entire bottle of something on myself).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>lost just as much hair as usual and for the first time in my life I developed dandruff because the products dry your scalp out so much.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Now for the product review:  I have always had baby fine, pencil straight, thin hair</li>
            <li>First, I should say that I have long been a big fan of everything by Aveda.  </li>
            <li>Invati initially received a lot of glowing reviews around the web, so thought I&#x27;d give the whole system a try after speaking with an associate at a local salon.</li>
            <li>hair is noticeably thicker and fuller - I am typically very sensitive to aromas and odors and though at the store I could smell a definite aroma to Invati, decided to try it and see what it was like during prolonged use.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s only been two weeks so far!  </li>
            <li>For what I spent I don&#x27;t feel as though it has done much for me.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 23 year old male and began using this because my salon told me to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>I only use the product in 2 places twice a day, so I don&#x27;t use near the amount they say to use (to save $$$).</li>
            <li>My hair is now quite thin on top.</li>
            <li>Have used the Nioxin product in the past - my wife thought I should stop with it when she read something negative about it - recently switched to the Aveda Invati system, shampoo, conditioner, spray revitalizer and am getting good results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not cheap either, costing over $30 a bottle you&#x27;d hope it would at least make your hair feel nice...</li>
            <li>Invati absolutely slowed down the process.</li>
            <li>What I am wondering is whether or not I am experiencing an initial shedding phase and that the hair I have lost will come back - similar to what people have reported from their positive experiences with other topical treatments, such as Rogaine.</li>
            <li>I was very skeptical when I finally decided to pay this much for a product, but I am glad I did.</li>
            <li>I normally wash my hair every other day</li>
    </ol>

            <li> So I was glad when I found out that they now carry a line for thinning hair.  </li>
            <li> However, I can&#x27;t understand why Amazon is charging so much more for a product that routinely retails for $60.  </li>
            <li> I was expecting so much more from these products...</li>
            <li> My hair has not be so healthy in years.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a bit over a month and have enjoyed the stimulating feeling when applying to my scalp but have notice a healthier and increased volume.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so pleased I pinch myself every time I comb through my hair.</li>
            <li> I have been using all three Invati products and have confidently</li>
            <li> As most reviewers say, this product</li>
            <li> many shampoos</li>
            <li> hairs keep growing, and my hair looks and feels healthy and youthful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> a healthy lifestyle help my hair look</li>
            <li> in looking and being healthy at any age.  </li>
            <li> in looking and being healthy at any age.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> the product does make my scalp feel better.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> Much better condition</li>
            <li> Since I have started the Invati system, I have noticed that my hair feels thicker to the touch (my ponytail feels more like it used to)</li>
            <li> and I have more body and bounce in my hair.  </li>
            <li> I will try to post again after some more time using the product.</li>
            <li> I was glad that</li>
            <li> This has worked better than rogaine for both my husband and myself.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s magic.</li>
            <li> Better than when I started to lose.&lt;br</li>
            <li> plus it&#x27;s actually ok</li>
            <li> Although Aveda smells good &amp; has a great reputation, this product fell short.</li>
            <li> I am sure not everyone would react to the smell of this product as I did</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> If I you go more than 1 day without washing your hair it will start to mat up on your scalp.</li>
            <li> This has an overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Thankfully my hair and scalp are recovering, and in most places growing back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t able to sleep because of the strong odor.  </li>
            <li> Better yet, get a free sample if you can.  </li>
            <li> It so far is giving me great</li>
            <li> and it dries very quickly.  </li>
            <li> Think about it - how could something where the main ingredient is &amp;#34;denatured alcohol&amp;#34; be good for your scalp?  </li>
            <li> As another reviewer stated, the smell of this product is horribly strong....</li>
            <li> It goes on a bit strong but as it dries it fades.  </li>
            <li> anyone using this product for a while experienced something similar?</li>
            <li> Reminds me of a cheap man&#x27;s cologne.</li>
            <li> I did not find this as effective as the bottle that I purchased straight from an Aveda salon.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve learned that you get what you pay for, and Aveda products are so good for your hair plus made from natural ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> So by using this natural product it creates the ideal climate for hair health and new growth.</li>
            <li> It was very sticky, made my roots incredibly greasy, and mind you, I don&#x27;t have oily hair, quite the opposite.</li>
            <li> (mine was in a large mall, and many salons carry the line) to buy this-</li>
            <li> If Aveda can reformulate to reduce the intensity of the odor, I would most certainly try this product again.</li>
            <li> It says right on the bottle, flammable!</li>
            <li> I love this product and have been using it for the past six months with great results.  </li>
            <li> I was given a full explanation and demonstration.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I now turn the shower to cool water for those procedures.&lt;br /&gt; 2.  </li>
            <li> Had so much better results with much cheaper products.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if the seller dilluted it or something, but when bought this from a legit salon it seems much more potent and really does help reduce shedding and breakage while letting new hair grow in.  </li>
            <li> I started the Mirena IUD in June and started getting the side effect of losing hair quickly.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noted any more than normal hair loss in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not hurting and it provides a good excuse for me to give myself a head massage.</li>
            <li> his slowed down greatly again.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this system and products, worth the price, and am getting more when I run out.  </li>
            <li> Thanks you Aveda!!</li>
            <li> After about 6 months of using this product my hair is full and thick and gorgeous again!</li>
            <li> any kind of a rubber band to tie hair back, even the ones that are</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> So far, I am very impressed with this product, but I&#x27;ve only used it for a very short period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Invati by Aveda has worked an absolute miracle on my hair!</li>
            <li> I shared&lt;br /&gt;the same dilemma as many women my age...</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use hot shower water to shampoo</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference in my hair the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li> It actually looks and feels healthy.  </li>
            <li> Much luck to all!  </li>
            <li> One of the first ingredients is alcohol.</li>
            <li> I used vitamin E-oil on my scalp and it&#x27;s looking much healthier!</li>
            <li> The first use of this product produced immediate relief and after using up the sample over a period of 3 weeks, I ordered, again.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Just a warning - and I heard from an Aveda hairdresser that I am not the first person she has heard this from.</li>
            <li> I was very concerned about my suddenly thinning hair and tried many products to address this concern.</li>
            <li> Ultimately, if this stuff really works for me, I&#x27;d love for the world to see it and for there to be tangible evidence that hair growth as achieved (although this is not claimed by them as an effect).  </li>
            <li> The scent of this product is so strong and so repulsive that I was not able to use it more that a couple of times.  </li>
            <li> The improvements have come slowly and there&#x27;s still a ways to go, but she&#x27;s happy with the product despite the high price.</li>
            <li> I am very sensitive to smells and personally don&#x27;t like the smell of most of the Aveda products anyway,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best product I&#x27;ve ever used for fine hair that is a little thin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;which is a very flattering hairstyle for my age group.  </li>
            <li> very heavy/spicy.  </li>
            <li> Your advice would be much appreciated.</li>
            <li> The whole Invati system.  </li>
            <li> It has really helped me.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really notice the smell of the system anymore except when I am using</li>
            <li> My hair looked and felt much thicker.  </li>
            <li> I used the product at night, and in the morning just wet my hair, and as I did I thought \\&quot;this is where the magic goes away\\</li>
            <li> I couldnt bring myself to spring for the whole line.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t like the smell so much</li>
            <li> Buy the whole system; shampoo, conditioner, styling products and revitalizer.</li>
            <li> but I do think it is an unusually unflattering fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I am getting ready to try the Phylia de M. line.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t really rate the product yet, since I haven&#x27;t tried it.</li>
            <li> Does this stuff really make your hair thicker?</li>
            <li> Does it really keep your hair from falling out?</li>
            <li> Does it really revitalize the scalp?</li>
            <li> The system really does what it is intended to do.  </li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> I reasoned that my hair was \\&quot;adjusting\\&quot; to the whole system.</li>
            <li> Apparently the turmeric may be too strong for the sensitive types.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of Aveda products, especially since I have dry, fine hair.  </li>
            <li> I have concerned with a batch of hair loss at the top of my head due to my stress and genetic reasons.  </li>
            <li> I am now back to using a regular sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner and they provide a much better effect that this very overpriced product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the full amount that they recommend, only about 8 sprays day and night</li>
            <li> Glad I broke down and purchased it.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m beginning to see new hairs growing in my hairline!  </li>
            <li> or I&#x27;ve use a lot of styling products to make it look halfway decent.  </li>
            <li> Someone told me about it and all the rave reviews, one in particular that takes Arthritis medication and has hair loss peeked my interest</li>
            <li> Had really high hopes for this line...read about and researched before it came out.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I hope other users sense of smell is not as sensitive as mine and you have better luck with the product.  </li>
            <li> So far I have been using this product (and the whole line) for 2 1/2 months with no discernible results.  </li>
            <li> My hair, while still full and long, has taken a beating after having my son and work-related stress.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure the heavy fragrance does not help matters either.  </li>
            <li> (less gray more of her natural color) and some reversal of hair thinning.</li>
            <li> but if I went more than a dry, it made my hair feel gross.  </li>
            <li> I can actually see fine hairs growing again, and I&#x27;ve only been using it a month.  </li>
            <li> (The shampoo I can live with.)  </li>
            <li> So if you are going to try these products - get the smaller bottles first.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re interested in following my story, I&#x27;m doing weekly blog posts with pictures to show the results.  </li>
            <li> an Aveda scam as far as I&#x27;m concerned!</li>
            <li> Had significant hair loss and the evidence is that after hair washing their is much less hair in the drain area.</li>
            <li> It really works and clearly see a big improvement in hair thickness.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Scalp revitalizer - this was my least favorite product of them all.  </li>
            <li> Now 4 months in those short hairs have remained and are much longer.  </li>
            <li> I use the complete system, from shampoo, conditioner, and the scalp revitalizer.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in the over 60 year old</li>
            <li> The smell is far nicer</li>
            <li> It is very transparent to me and do not notice anything different after using it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have naturally oily hair as well</li>
            <li> If you want to spend this much money,  I suggest improving your diet, massage your scalp with an inexpensive oil such as Sesame, use gentle products, and give anything left over to someone in need.</li>
            <li> So far, my hair has almost completely ceased falling out</li>
            <li> so far-</li>
            <li> I never write reviews but this product will do some damage if you have a sensitive scalp.</li>
            <li> Yes, I fell for it, and it angers me that I was taken by a complete scam.</li>
            <li> Here is why:  the box was completely disfigured and looked like someone had literally stepped on it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of products, natural and pharmaceutical, to stop the irritation and flaking on my scalp.</li>
            <li> The nozzle on this version helps to deliver the product directly to the scalp, which makes application even easier.</li>
            <li> No price difference on Amazon, so my advice is to purchase directly from Aveda.</li>
            <li> I only use the scalp revitalizer and pair it with other sulfate free shampoos and conditioners (wen, dermorganics, etc.)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not only is my hair stronger, new hair is growing!</li>
            <li> Although I have fine hair and it tends to look thinner in the winter months, it usually fills out by summer.</li>
            <li> The price point is a bit high, but I got off Rogaine, started using this, and have immediately seen some big changes.  </li>
            <li> Once daily, after pulling my hair into a high bun, I spritz the product in 12 or so locations at the scalp and massage in.</li>
            <li> Not a bad smell in general but not one I associate with myself (and absolutely not so much that someone would think I&#x27;d spilled an entire bottle of something on myself).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> lost just as much hair as usual and for the first time in my life I developed dandruff because the products dry your scalp out so much.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Now for the product review:  I have always had baby fine, pencil straight, thin hair</li>
            <li> First, I should say that I have long been a big fan of everything by Aveda.  </li>
            <li> Invati initially received a lot of glowing reviews around the web, so thought I&#x27;d give the whole system a try after speaking with an associate at a local salon.</li>
            <li> hair is noticeably thicker and fuller - I am typically very sensitive to aromas and odors and though at the store I could smell a definite aroma to Invati, decided to try it and see what it was like during prolonged use.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only been two weeks so far!  </li>
            <li> For what I spent I don&#x27;t feel as though it has done much for me.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 23 year old male and began using this because my salon told me to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> I only use the product in 2 places twice a day, so I don&#x27;t use near the amount they say to use (to save $$$).</li>
            <li> My hair is now quite thin on top.</li>
            <li> Have used the Nioxin product in the past - my wife thought I should stop with it when she read something negative about it - recently switched to the Aveda Invati system, shampoo, conditioner, spray revitalizer and am getting good results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not cheap either, costing over $30 a bottle you&#x27;d hope it would at least make your hair feel nice...</li>
            <li> Invati absolutely slowed down the process.</li>
            <li> What I am wondering is whether or not I am experiencing an initial shedding phase and that the hair I have lost will come back - similar to what people have reported from their positive experiences with other topical treatments, such as Rogaine.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical when I finally decided to pay this much for a product, but I am glad I did.</li>
            <li> I normally wash my hair every other day</li>
            <li> /&gt;For stopping hair loss or causing hair to re-grow, I definitely did NOT see this happen in the long term.  </li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;ve turned fifty, due to diabetes and hormone changes, my hair has thinned out even more and is limp and lifeless and dull.  </li>
            <li> I love their Blue Malva shampoos, I am crazy about the smell.  </li>
            <li> &quot; all of them have natural Ayurvedic items in them and they cost less then</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the product&#x27;s odor is so intense and pervasive that I absolutely cannot use it.</li>
            <li> Not only does this product fail in many levels, it causes hair discoloration and a feeling of physical sickness just applying small amounts.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I would warn against this product, but if you are hellbent on trying it, know that if you experience an increase in hair shed... it won&#x27;t subside as long as you continue to use Invati.</li>
            <li> It is so dry and and &amp;#34;lifeless&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> purchased a micro fiber towel, and now pat my hair dry</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t imagine what this does to dry hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been following the instructions by spraying it directly onto my scalp and massaging it twice a day and letting it dry for at least four hours.</li>
            <li> It also my made my hair extremely dry.</li>
            <li> While the shedding was limited, I give props to using Fo-ti capsules.  </li>
            <li> I still loose hair.  </li>
            <li> It burns your scalp and leaves it dry!</li>
            <li> i definitely see less fallout after i shower and comb my hair.</li>
            <li> With in 1 month I started seeing little short hairs growing.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t sleep last night after spraying a little in my scalp.  </li>
            <li> I was shocked that you would pay more at Amazon??</li>
            <li> I have suffered a brain anurism last year and was hospitalised for a few months as a result.  </li>
            <li> I stopped wearing my hair straight because it had gotten so thin.</li>
            <li> Refrain from roughly drying hair with your bath towel.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The conditioner smells like wet clay.  </li>
            <li> The package arrived on time and the product is as I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> My hair is now to the middle of my back and thick.</li>
            <li> No, &amp;#34;it reduces hair loss due to breakage from external factors&amp;#34; (what the heck does breakage from external factors mean??).</li>
            <li> In fact, i switched from Rogaine to this to test it by itself without any other drugs adding to it</li>
            <li> Been a long time customer of Amazon but unless I&#x27;m missing something, the scalp revitalizer is overpriced here.  </li>
            <li> Now im working on hair loss due to breakage.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t use it as directed on bottle,i just use it at night every other night when i know i am shampooing in the morning</li>
            <li> No, it makes it &amp;#34;appear&amp;#34; thicker (about as well as any other volumizing product).</li>
            <li> First my scalp got hot all overit , then got red bumps all over the scalp, then the worst case of dandruff was the end result.</li>
            <li> Altho used w. other Aveda Invati products as recommended, my hair is no thicker.</li>
            <li> Holy cow...</li>
            <li> I come from land of holy cow.</li>
            <li> My hair loss was definitely less than with other shampoos.</li>
            <li> A little disappointed in the seller but am ok with the product itself.</li>
            <li> The bottle is rather small for someone with long hair, so after one month, I had to buy</li>
            <li> I read the reviews online and took a chance and shelled out a lot of money (at least for me) for the shampoo, conditioner and scalp revitalizer (the entire</li>
            <li> or so I began noticing a thick yellow scaly patches where I massaged the product in.</li>
            <li> Instead, I was stuck with greasy hair and $200 down the drain.  </li>
            <li> Used a few times and it left my hair really hard and took the shine away</li>
            <li> I started to see thicker hair with noticabley less falling out.</li>
            <li> I began using this product on both sides of my slightly receding hair line.</li>
            <li> less hair on the floor and brush.  </li>
            <li> After using this system for a week or two, there was noticeably less hair in my brush.  </li>
            <li> Maybe a little less in the way of hair loss, however, I don&#x27;t like the way it makes my hair feel.  </li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the Invati system for a little over a week now</li>
            <li> $100 down the drain!</li>
            <li> I am generally a fan of Aveda but this entire line is nonsense and this particular product is the worst of the lot.  </li>
            <li> Big farce....</li>
            <li> Total rip-off.</li>
            <li> I was loosing hair by the googoobs everyday.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll use the product before shampooing...leave it on for a few minutes before getting into the shower.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I had a few friends rave about this product.</li>
            <li> I have grown to like the aroma, it is definitely not a chemical or perfume smell - it smells faintly citrus-like with some other hints of maybe ginger or ginseng.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Though expensive, I can use extremely little of the product per use, especially of the conditioner, to where I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m flushing money down the drain.</li>
            <li> but my hair feels like I just poured molasses on it - stiff and greasy.  </li>
            <li> If I used it on dry hair, it was immediately dirty and had a yucky white residue, which was visible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> First the smell is bad.</li>
            <li> After malnutrition due to a long illness my hair was very thin.  </li>
            <li> Also, the instructions were vague about the daily usage.  </li>
            <li> It is also expensive, about $130 for the entire system.</li>
            <li> I have followed all the instructions(16 sprays, and message my scalp at least 5 minutes everyday).  </li>
            <li> now.&lt;br /&gt;Won&#x27;t purchase again, but at least wanted to give it a try.</li>
            <li> also left my hair looking dirty and feeling stiff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do not notice any difference in how thick my hair is (or feels).  </li>
            <li> However, to my surprise, although my hair did not seem as thick as it did the night before, it was still thick and held a style well.  </li>
            <li> Why do I have to waste money on this useless stuff?</li>
            <li> So far - this line is worthless at any price.</li>
            <li> (i.e., hard water, water overly treated by the city - a horrible problem where I live).  </li>
            <li> This is a tough review because I did get results from using this product</li>
            <li> (I find the odor heavy and oppressing) but this line is definitely the worst they have come up with yet, in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> False advertising.</li>
            <li> Needless to say I&#x27;m not only disappointed but</li>
            <li> Thought they were useless on my thin hair.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve always had to either perm my hair (until my thirties when I became sick of the time and money wasted)</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it did NOTHING to strengthen, lengthen, thicken or GROW my hair at all.  </li>
            <li> It was scary.</li>
            <li> It is way too expensive.  </li>
            <li> I am skeptical of this since Invati isn&#x27;t a hair regrowth product to begin with</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t have any changes for my hair growth after 8 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t find that unpleasant.</li>
            <li> My biggest complaint is that the  the scalp revitalizer and the conditioner smell just terrible.  </li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about this product.</li>
            <li> Very expensive product.</li>
            <li> Follow up: (9/10/13)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed.</li>
            <li> very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Shame on this company for playing on the desperation of a woman whose losing her hair to make an obscene profit on a worthless product!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Had really high hopes for this line...read about and researched before it came out.  Unfortunately, it did NOTHING to strengthen, lengthen, thicken or GROW my hair at all.  Big farce....very disappointing.</li>
            <li> This product work great.</li>
            <li> First, I should say that I have long been a big fan of everything by Aveda.  I love their Blue Malva shampoos, I am crazy about the smell.  So I was glad when I found out that they now carry a line for thinning hair.  My hair, while still full and long, has taken a beating after having my son and work-related stress.  I decided to help my scalp regenerate some growth.  I bought the entire Invati system, from the shampoo to the revitalizer.  The price was rather steep but having used Aveda before, I was optimistic.  Here&#x27;s my feedback.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  Shampoo - watery texture, which is something I like, but others may feel \\&quot;oh, not enough foam, this isn&#x27;t working.\\&quot; The bottle is rather small for someone with long hair, so after one month, I had to buy another one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  Conditioner - nice texture, spreads evenly, has a nice smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  Scalp revitalizer - this was my least favorite product of them all.  It was very sticky, made my roots incredibly greasy, and mind you, I don&#x27;t have oily hair, quite the opposite. Also, the instructions were vague about the daily usage.  If I used it on dry hair, it was immediately dirty and had a yucky white residue, which was visible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this line for 2 months, I have to say I saw no results whatsoever.  While the shedding was limited, I give props to using Fo-ti capsules.  Instead, I was stuck with greasy hair and $200 down the drain.  I am now back to using a regular sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner and they provide a much better effect that this very overpriced product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of Aveda products, especially since I have dry, fine hair.  Yes, its pricey, but I&#x27;ve learned that you get what you pay for, and Aveda products are so good for your hair plus made from natural ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;This revitalizer  spray is actually making a difference in problem thinning areas of my hair.  I can actually see fine hairs growing again, and I&#x27;ve only been using it a month.  I can&#x27;t wait to see the difference in 6 months.  Thanks you Aveda!!</li>
            <li> The Aveda Hair Care System is superior to others I have tried. I noticed a big difference in the thickness and fullness of my hair within three weeks of using this product along with the shampoo and conditioner. My hair loss was definitely less than with other shampoos. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love this product and have been using it for the past six months with great results.  However, I can&#x27;t understand why Amazon is charging so much more for a product that routinely retails for $60.  Total rip-off.</li>
            <li> Product seems to be working as suggested.  Had significant hair loss and the evidence is that after hair washing their is much less hair in the drain area.</li>
            <li> I was expecting so much more from these products...I purchased the Invati system (shampoo, conditioner and treatment) a couple of months ago.  I paid $350 (in Canada) and besides the smell that appeals to me, nothing else does.  I have suffered a brain anurism last year and was hospitalised for a few months as a result.  My hair has been cut and parts of it shaved during my hospitalisation.  Part of my recovery involved radiosurgery, which did not help my hair situation...I was loosing lots of hair and it scared me.  The Invati system did nothing in terms of making my hair feel thicker, or my scalp healthier (on the contrary, itchy, flacky scalp resulted from the use of this probuct).  I still loose hair.  To be honest, I had much better results with the Pantene AgeDefy thickening treatment...which was a fraction of the price.  So if you are going to try these products - get the smaller bottles first.  Better yet, get a free sample if you can.  Good luck!</li>
            <li> I stopped using it after 5 months because it seems not to help at all. Why do I have to waste money on this useless stuff?</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about 4 months.  I am on Arthritis medications that cause hair loss, so I tried it. With in 1 month I started seeing little short hairs growing.  And the amount of hair loss at shampoo time and styling time is so much&lt;br /&gt;less.  Now 4 months in those short hairs have remained and are much longer.  I use the complete system, from shampoo, conditioner, and the scalp revitalizer.  My hair has not be so healthy in years.</li>
            <li> I was very concerned about my suddenly thinning hair and tried many products to address this concern. Nothing seemed to work until I tried the invati line. I started to see thicker hair with noticabley less falling out. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results.</li>
            <li> I began using this product on both sides of my slightly receding hair line. Within about a week or so I began noticing a thick yellow scaly patches where I massaged the product in. I stopped using it shortly after this. Even weeks later I&#x27;m still getting break outs in the area I applied this and now I&#x27;m actually seeing hair fall out. Needless to say I&#x27;m not only disappointed but quite frankly I&#x27;m pissed off. Hopefully my hair will eventually grow back in these spots.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a bit over a month and have enjoyed the stimulating feeling when applying to my scalp but have notice a healthier and increased volume.</li>
            <li> So far I have been using this product (and the whole line) for 2 1/2 months with no discernible results.  I don&#x27;t mind the smell that others complain about but my hair feels like I just poured molasses on it - stiff and greasy.  So far - this line is worthless at any price.</li>
            <li> Bought the revitalizer spray, as well as shampoo and conditioner.  Can&#x27;t say that I am too impressed.  For what I spent I don&#x27;t feel as though it has done much for me.  Have been using for about a month.  Maybe a little less in the way of hair loss, however, I don&#x27;t like the way it makes my hair feel.  It is so dry and and &amp;#34;lifeless&amp;#34; now.&lt;br /&gt;Won&#x27;t purchase again, but at least wanted to give it a try.</li>
            <li> I am generally a fan of Aveda but this entire line is nonsense and this particular product is the worst of the lot.  All I got was an itchy, irritated scalp!  Think about it - how could something where the main ingredient is &amp;#34;denatured alcohol&amp;#34; be good for your scalp?  I&#x27;m sure the heavy fragrance does not help matters either.  Also gave me acne all along the hairline.</li>
            <li> Invati by Aveda has worked an absolute miracle on my hair! I was loosing hair by the googoobs everyday. It was scary. I stopped wearing my hair straight because it had gotten so thin. One week of using the scalp revitalizer and shampoo my hair shedding stopped by 75%! No lie. I have a picture of the pile of hair I was loosing from this summer and what I&#x27;m loosing now but it looks gross in photos and I&#x27;m not gonna post that...sorry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Here are a couple of warnings. It can be drying. I go into overdrive with the moisture for my curls. It is also expensive, about $130 for the entire system. I only use the spray and shampoo. Some people don&#x27;t like the herbal smell. It doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. If you&#x27;re loosing hair go to the Aveda shop and get a sample. I&#x27;m so pleased I pinch myself every time I comb through my hair.</li>
            <li> The scent of this product is so strong and so repulsive that I was not able to use it more that a couple of times.  When using it before bed I wasn&#x27;t able to sleep because of the strong odor.  So I have no idea whether this product works or not.</li>
            <li> I have been using all three Invati products and have confidently&lt;br /&gt;recommended them to several friends.  I&#x27;m in the over 60 year old&lt;br /&gt;group of ladies who continue to strive to look and feel marvelous.  I shared&lt;br /&gt;the same dilemma as many women my age...hair drying, breaking and&lt;br /&gt;thinning. Yet, I wanted longer hair to wear clipped back with bangs,&lt;br /&gt;which is a very flattering hairstyle for my age group.  I came upon&lt;br /&gt;an ad in a magazine for Invati, and immediately went to the salon&lt;br /&gt;that carried Aveda.  I was given a full explanation and demonstration.&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try the produce and because of the great service I received,  I&lt;br /&gt;immediately changed to that salon.  As most reviewers say, this product&lt;br /&gt;works, without question.  My hair became instantly thicker, and within&lt;br /&gt;a several weeks, I felt hairs growing from the root.  The smell is far nicer&lt;br /&gt;than many shampoos, so I hope Aveda does not change anything on this&lt;br /&gt;product.  It&#x27;s been almost two months since I started using all three, and&lt;br /&gt;the hairs keep growing, and my hair looks and feels healthy and youthful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; stylist recommended using the spray on the root line morning and&lt;br /&gt;night.  She suggested washing my hair only three times a week, and&lt;br /&gt;using the Invati conditioner just on the ends of my hair.  A couple&lt;br /&gt;more tips from my stylist:  1.  Don&#x27;t use hot shower water to shampoo&lt;br /&gt;or rinse hair...I now turn the shower to cool water for those procedures.&lt;br /&gt; 2.  Refrain from roughly drying hair with your bath towel.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased a micro fiber towel, and now pat my hair dry, then&lt;br /&gt;wrap it in this towel and it dries very quickly.  Lastly, she said to never&lt;br /&gt;use any kind of a rubber band to tie hair back, even the ones that are&lt;br /&gt;made for that purpose still break your hair.  I use a rubber backed hair clip.&lt;br /&gt;These simple steps, and a healthy lifestyle help my hair look decades&lt;br /&gt;younger.  So simple...if you are reading these reviews, you are likely&lt;br /&gt;interested in looking and being healthy at any age.  Best to you!.if you are reading these reviews, you are likely&lt;br /&gt;interested in looking and being healthy at any age.  Best to you!</li>
            <li> Purchased both shampoo and scalp spray.  Thought they were useless on my thin hair.  Had so much better results with much cheaper products.  Now I understand why no salons in this area carry Aveda products.  $100 down the drain!</li>
            <li> As another reviewer stated, the smell of this product is horribly strong....very heavy/spicy.  Not a bad smell in general but not one I associate with myself (and absolutely not so much that someone would think I&#x27;d spilled an entire bottle of something on myself).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also left my hair looking dirty and feeling stiff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the big problem is that the fumes sting my eyes and have turned the whites red in just a couple of hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll use the product before shampooing...leave it on for a few minutes before getting into the shower.  Maybe it&#x27;ll still have some effect.  Maybe not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that the instructions for this state that you&#x27;re to use it twice a day...not just after washing your hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t write a lot of reviews, but this one I must.  It really works and clearly see a big improvement in hair thickness.&lt;br /&gt;Not only is my hair stronger, new hair is growing!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. For me it definitely works. It is way too expensive.  And ordering it online resulted in a damaged bottle.</li>
            <li> Mom says best product made!</li>
            <li> Have used the Nioxin product in the past - my wife thought I should stop with it when she read something negative about it - recently switched to the Aveda Invati system, shampoo, conditioner, spray revitalizer and am getting good results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is noticeably thicker and fuller - I am typically very sensitive to aromas and odors and though at the store I could smell a definite aroma to Invati, decided to try it and see what it was like during prolonged use.  I have grown to like the aroma, it is definitely not a chemical or perfume smell - it smells faintly citrus-like with some other hints of maybe ginger or ginseng.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t feel anything in my hair during the day, like a gel, the revitalizer spray I squirt on in the morning and try to do the same at night.  It is very transparent to me and do not notice anything different after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this system and products, worth the price, and am getting more when I run out.  I just saw giant-size bottles of the system for like $120 each now in 2013 - that is my next stop!  Though expensive, I can use extremely little of the product per use, especially of the conditioner, to where I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m flushing money down the drain.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Invati products including the scalp revitalizer now for about a month.  I do not notice any difference in how thick my hair is (or feels).  I will say it does look very healthy.  My biggest complaint is that the  the scalp revitalizer and the conditioner smell just terrible.  (The shampoo I can live with.)  The conditioner smells like wet clay.  I would swear that the revitalizer has patchouli oil in it (which I believe was actually referred to once on television as \\&quot;stinky oil\\&quot;).  I am very sensitive to smells and personally don&#x27;t like the smell of most of the Aveda products anyway, (I find the odor heavy and oppressing) but this line is definitely the worst they have come up with yet, in my opinion.  Guess I&#x27;m just not an \\&quot;essential oil\\&quot; type of person.</li>
            <li> I used this as well as the shampoo and conditioner for a couple months. I didn&#x27;t find it made a difference at all aside from the fact that the spray has mousse like chemicals in it it doesn&#x27;t actually make your hair fuller.&lt;br /&gt;I lost just as much hair as usual and for the first time in my life I developed dandruff because the products dry your scalp out so much. I have naturally oily hair as well so I can&#x27;t imagine what this does to dry hair. My hair felt like straw after using this product for a while.&lt;br /&gt;I gave it a shot and would never use this product again. It&#x27;s not cheap either, costing over $30 a bottle you&#x27;d hope it would at least make your hair feel nice... nope!</li>
            <li> Nice stuff, good smell too.</li>
            <li> it seems to work.  less hair on the floor and brush.  I do like it ..I think it is a bit pricy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a couple of years along with Invati shampoo and conditioner. It&#x27;s the best product I&#x27;ve ever used for fine hair that is a little thin. It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Not only does this product fail in many levels, it causes hair discoloration and a feeling of physical sickness just applying small amounts.  If you want to spend this much money,  I suggest improving your diet, massage your scalp with an inexpensive oil such as Sesame, use gentle products, and give anything left over to someone in need.</li>
            <li> After using this system for a week or two, there was noticeably less hair in my brush.  Interesting, but nice, smell.</li>
            <li> My wife has been using the Aveda Invanti Scalp Revitalizer spray for four months.  She has had improvements in hair color (less gray more of her natural color) and some reversal of hair thinning. The improvements have come slowly and there&#x27;s still a ways to go, but she&#x27;s happy with the product despite the high price.</li>
            <li> the product arrived on time with no visible damage. the product does make my scalp feel better. And the scent of the product is plesent</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 23 year old male and began using this because my salon told me to give it a try.  So far, my hair has almost completely ceased falling out and I&#x27;m beginning to see new hairs growing in my hairline!  The price point is a bit high, but I got off Rogaine, started using this, and have immediately seen some big changes.  I&#x27;m going to continue using it and see where things go! It&#x27;s only been two weeks so far!  If you&#x27;re interested in following my story, I&#x27;m doing weekly blog posts with pictures to show the results.  They can be found at invatistory.blogspot.com ... Ultimately, if this stuff really works for me, I&#x27;d love for the world to see it and for there to be tangible evidence that hair growth as achieved (although this is not claimed by them as an effect).  It so far is giving me great results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;For stopping hair loss or causing hair to re-grow, I definitely did NOT see this happen in the long term.  In fact, i switched from Rogaine to this to test it by itself without any other drugs adding to it and I loss a TON of hair during this.  I&#x27;ve now gone back to Rogaine and my hair loss his slowed down greatly again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Aveda Invati product line (shampoo, conditioner, revitalizer) for over a month and have experienced a noticeable thinning in my front hairline, which is where I&#x27;ve been applying the revitalizer. I&#x27;ve been following the instructions by spraying it directly onto my scalp and massaging it twice a day and letting it dry for at least four hours. I am convinced that it is the cause of my further hairloss since nothing else has changed in my day-to-day (diet, stress, etc.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using the product with the understanding that it was meant for preserving the hair I still have and NOT for hair regrowth. What I am wondering is whether or not I am experiencing an initial shedding phase and that the hair I have lost will come back - similar to what people have reported from their positive experiences with other topical treatments, such as Rogaine. I am skeptical of this since Invati isn&#x27;t a hair regrowth product to begin with and so there shouldn&#x27;t even be a reaction of an initial shed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has anyone using this product for a while experienced something similar? Your advice would be much appreciated.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  The whole Invati system.  It has really helped me.&lt;br /&gt;My hair was thinning and now it&#x27;s getting thicker.  Much better condition</li>
            <li> Follow up: (9/10/13) I have been using the Invati system for about 9 months now and my hair has doubled in thickness. It is still growing out but I can tell it&#x27;s a lot thicker and people have noticed as well! I don&#x27;t really notice the smell of the system anymore except when I am using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the Invati system for a little over a week now and I can already notice a difference.  I started the Mirena IUD in June and started getting the side effect of losing hair quickly.  Since I have started the Invati system, I have noticed that my hair feels thicker to the touch (my ponytail feels more like it used to) and I have more body and bounce in my hair.  I don&#x27;t use the full amount that they recommend, only about 8 sprays day and night and this keeps my hair from getting too soaked with product.  The scent goes on a bit strong but it fades as your hair dries to a pleasant herbal scent.  I will try to post again after some more time using the product.</li>
            <li> Been a long time customer of Amazon but unless I&#x27;m missing something, the scalp revitalizer is overpriced here.  Go to the Aveda website or to an Aveda store (mine was in a large mall, and many salons carry the line) to buy this- I paid $60.00 for 150 ml of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the product review:  I have always had baby fine, pencil straight, thin hair and I&#x27;ve always had to either perm my hair (until my thirties when I became sick of the time and money wasted) or I&#x27;ve use a lot of styling products to make it look halfway decent.  Now that I&#x27;ve turned fifty, due to diabetes and hormone changes, my hair has thinned out even more and is limp and lifeless and dull.  I was very skeptical about this product. Nothing has worked for me so far- I&#x27;ve had only temporary fixes to date.  I read the reviews online and took a chance and shelled out a lot of money (at least for me) for the shampoo, conditioner and scalp revitalizer (the entire Invati system).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is incredible.  I noticed a difference in my hair the first time I used it.  My hair looked and felt much thicker.  I used the product at night, and in the morning just wet my hair, and as I did I thought \\&quot;this is where the magic goes away\\&quot;.  However, to my surprise, although my hair did not seem as thick as it did the night before, it was still thick and held a style well.  My hair actually had \\&quot;bounce.\\&quot;  It actually looks and feels healthy.  So far, I am very impressed with this product, but I&#x27;ve only used it for a very short period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some women have been turned off by the smell of the revitalizer.  I didn&#x27;t mind it.  To me it smells like herbs and I didn&#x27;t find that unpleasant. It goes on a bit strong but as it dries it fades.  I also note that the product was drying to the hair for some; this hasn&#x27;t happened to me yet. I haven&#x27;t noted any more than normal hair loss in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are thinking of trying this product, do so.  I was glad that I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to check in again in about a month to give an update.I am going to check in again in about a month to give an update.</li>
            <li> Just great I&#x27;ve used it before</li>
            <li> I couldnt bring myself to spring for the whole line. I only use the scalp revitalizer and pair it with other sulfate free shampoos and conditioners (wen, dermorganics, etc.) It took about 2 weeks to see a diff. I wash and use the scalp revitalizer about 4x a week. After using regularly, all my hair loss at the root has virtualy stopped. Now im working on hair loss due to breakage.</li>
            <li> This has worked better than rogaine for both my husband and myself.  You do need to give it time and one bottle won&#x27;t give you permanent results.  I think by bottle 2 it was working it&#x27;s magic.</li>
            <li> i definitely see less fallout after i shower and comb my hair. i don&#x27;t like the smell so much but since i feel like it helps i&#x27;ll keep using it. i don&#x27;t use it as directed on bottle,i just use it at night every other night when i know i am shampooing in the morning and i still think it works for me, hair feels thicker and healthier. give it a try.</li>
            <li> Noticed a difference in the way my receding hairline blends. No regrowth yet but my hair looks good. Better than when I started to lose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Advice. Buy the whole system; shampoo, conditioner, styling products and revitalizer. Why? Because balding is caused by clogged pores, age, fatigue, stress and it&#x27;s hereditary. So by using this natural product it creates the ideal climate for hair health and new growth. If it doesn&#x27;t work send it back. Keep u posted. The smell, we&#x27;ll u get used to it plus it&#x27;s actually ok and I&#x27;m a guy. I only use the revitalizer on the spots that need it and like everything, consistency and moderation.</li>
            <li> No. False advertising. Didn&#x27;t see or feel any difference or improvement whatsoever. Although Aveda smells good &amp; has a great reputation, this product fell short. It&#x27;s a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because my hairdresser said I had a lot of \\&quot;buildup\\&quot; on the back of my scalp from years of product use and perhaps from water problems in my home (i.e., hard water, water overly treated by the city - a horrible problem where I live).  The salon recommended this product along with the shampoo &amp; conditioner.  I put this product on before bed and could not sleep!  The smell gave me a migraine within the 5 minutes it was on my head, gave the bed a horrendous stink, and drove my partner to the bedroom on the opposite side of the house (no kidding).  I am sure not everyone would react to the smell of this product as I did but I do think it is an unusually unflattering fragrance.  I hope other users sense of smell is not as sensitive as mine and you have better luck with the product.  Much luck to all!  :)</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical when I finally decided to pay this much for a product, but I am glad I did. I don&#x27;t know if it will actually make hair growth but it does make the hair appear thicker. I have a cowlick  where I had to do some teasing (because of aging) so my scalp didn&#x27;t show through. I only use the product in 2 places twice a day, so I don&#x27;t use near the amount they say to use (to save $$$). I don&#x27;t have to tease the hair anymore so I am very happy with it. Glad I broke down and purchased it.</li>
            <li> I never write reviews but this product will do some damage if you have a sensitive scalp. I had a few friends rave about this product. So trying to find a go solution for my thinning hair, since I have gone thru 100 products already, I gave it a shot. First the smell is bad. Reminds me of a cheap man&#x27;s cologne. Thinking if it helped my hair grow, I would look over the scent. Three weeks in and my scalp is red and inflamed. It broke out my hair line in the back. It also my made my hair extremely dry. If I you go more than 1 day without washing your hair it will start to mat up on your scalp. I normally wash my hair every other day but if I went more than a dry, it made my hair feel gross.  I am getting ready to try the Phylia de M. line. Heals the hair from the root, made with all botanicals.</li>
            <li> I used this once and will not use it again. This has an overwhelming. Smell of alcohol. The odor is very strong.. One of the first ingredients is alcohol. This was not explained to me. Very expensive product.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t really rate the product yet, since I haven&#x27;t tried it. Someone told me about it and all the rave reviews, one in particular that takes Arthritis medication and has hair loss peeked my interest so I decided to try it! Was looking on Aveda&#x27;s sight and thought it would be cheaper here.. It&#x27;s much more expensive here? I was shocked that you would pay more at Amazon?? Back to Aveda!!&lt;br /&gt;--------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;Just an Aveda scam as far as I&#x27;m concerned! It burns your scalp and leaves it dry! It says right on the bottle, flammable! On what planet would something flammable be good for your scalp? I used vitamin E-oil on my scalp and it&#x27;s looking much healthier! Not to mention a lot cheaper!</li>
            <li> Just read the packaging. Does this stuff really make your hair thicker? No, it makes it &amp;#34;appear&amp;#34; thicker (about as well as any other volumizing product). Does it really keep your hair from falling out? No, &amp;#34;it reduces hair loss due to breakage from external factors&amp;#34; (what the heck does breakage from external factors mean??). Does it really revitalize the scalp? Only &amp;#34;when massaged in&amp;#34; (um, do ya think that maybe it&#x27;s the massaging that revitalizes the scalp, not the product??). Shame on this company for playing on the desperation of a woman whose losing her hair to make an obscene profit on a worthless product! Yes, I fell for it, and it angers me that I was taken by a complete scam. Save your money ladies, this stuff just doesn&#x27;t do anything but make you smell like a bottle of men&#x27;s Vitalis hair tonic.</li>
            <li> I have heard amazing things about this product from both men and women.  The Pinterest world was buzzing about it&#x27;s benefits, so I figured I would give it a go.  I wish I would have ordered it from Aveda.  Here is why:  the box was completely disfigured and looked like someone had literally stepped on it.  There was no proof that it had not been used (ex:a seal to break or plastic covering).  A little disappointed in the seller but am ok with the product itself.</li>
            <li> Holy cow... I come from land of holy cow. Born and brought up there For 20 yrs and have used products which does similar things to this without breaking my bank. Go to any Indian groceries store and ask for \\&quot;hair oil\\&quot; all of them have natural Ayurvedic items in them and they cost less then 10$ dabar amala hair oil and mahabhrungraj oil are best in my opinion and will help with hair growth ans scalp rejuvination. I still use them once a week and works like a charm. Ihavent used this product hell don&#x27;t have mulas for that but it&#x27;s substitute works wonders I am not saying no to this product you got money go for it</li>
            <li> Will look forward to seeing the anti-hair thinning properties of this elixir. What I find amazing is that it has helped my scalp a great deal. I&#x27;ve tried a number of products, natural and pharmaceutical, to stop the irritation and flaking on my scalp. The first use of this product produced immediate relief and after using up the sample over a period of 3 weeks, I ordered, again. The nozzle on this version helps to deliver the product directly to the scalp, which makes application even easier. Once daily, after pulling my hair into a high bun, I spritz the product in 12 or so locations at the scalp and massage in.</li>
            <li> I use the Avati system and this is the final step.  The system really does what it is intended to do.  Since beginning to use the system, I am not losing hair.  I do have to say that, although this step is recommended by Aveda, I find that it is really not necessary to get the results intended.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t sleep last night after spraying a little in my scalp.  I had to get up and wash my hair.  Can&#x27;t use it during the day because it makes your hair look like you haven&#x27;t washed for days.  I&#x27;m so disappointed.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted. The package arrived on time and the product is as I expected it to be. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Used a few times and it left my hair really hard and took the shine away so I stopped using the product.</li>
            <li> I have concerned with a batch of hair loss at the top of my head due to my stress and genetic reasons.  I have bought all three aveda invati products eight weeks ago.  I have followed all the instructions(16 sprays, and message my scalp at least 5 minutes everyday).  I don&#x27;t feel any warming nor tingling sensations on my scalp.  Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t have any changes for my hair growth after 8 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend to people who find a product to reduce hair loss, but not for hair regrowth.</li>
            <li> I like its smell and tinglyness. Does it work? I have no idea. It&#x27;s not hurting and it provides a good excuse for me to give myself a head massage.</li>
            <li> Perfect..from start to finish  thank u</li>
            <li> I did not find this as effective as the bottle that I purchased straight from an Aveda salon.  I don&#x27;t know if the seller dilluted it or something, but when bought this from a legit salon it seems much more potent and really does help reduce shedding and breakage while letting new hair grow in.  No price difference on Amazon, so my advice is to purchase directly from Aveda.</li>
            <li> Invati initially received a lot of glowing reviews around the web, so thought I&#x27;d give the whole system a try after speaking with an associate at a local salon. My hair was rebounding from a health situation, and I was told that this would help create a perfect environment for my hair regrowth. I stuck with it for about 6 weeks (following directions to the letter) regardless of the fact that my hair shed increased. I reasoned that my hair was \\&quot;adjusting\\&quot; to the whole system. After a very obvious thinning spot occurred, I stop using the product. Thankfully my hair and scalp are recovering, and in most places growing back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would warn against this product, but if you are hellbent on trying it, know that if you experience an increase in hair shed... it won&#x27;t subside as long as you continue to use Invati.</li>
            <li> After malnutrition due to a long illness my hair was very thin.  After about 6 months of using this product my hair is full and thick and gorgeous again!</li>
            <li> aready using it before this purchase.  WORKS GREAT!!!!</li>
            <li> I started using Aveda hair thinning products shampoo and revitalizer after using Wen products with tea tree oil for a year. My hair looked very healthy.. Although I have fine hair and it tends to look thinner in the winter months, it usually fills out by summer. My hair was shiny and silky until I used the Invati line of products. My hair is now quite thin on top. First my scalp got hot all overit , then got red bumps all over the scalp, then the worst case of dandruff was the end result. My hair and scalp has never recovered from this reaction to these invati products. Just a warning - and I heard from an Aveda hairdresser that I am not the first person she has heard this from. Apparently the turmeric may be too strong for the sensitive types.</li>
            <li> Saved my hair. I was loosing my hair and this stopped it. My hair is now to the middle of my back and thick. I use it once a day and its wonderful.</li>
            <li> Altho used w. other Aveda Invati products as recommended, my hair is no thicker.</li>
            <li> This is a tough review because I did get results from using this product 2x/day. I&#x27;m 45 and losing a ton of hair. Invati absolutely slowed down the process. Unfortunately, the product&#x27;s odor is so intense and pervasive that I absolutely cannot use it. The odor does not subside throughout the day. Basically you go night and day reeking of the product. If Aveda can reformulate to reduce the intensity of the odor, I would most certainly try this product again.</li>
