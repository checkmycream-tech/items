            <li>This product is perfect for the dry winter months.</li>
            <li>Best used on my hair when it is dry</li>
            <li>It has just the right amount of hold and it does not leave a flaky trail like most gels when it dries!</li>
            <li>It also works exceptionally well for me when I do twist outs, and it leaves my hair feeling and looking very moisturized and well defined.</li>
            <li>I also love the smell, which is a creamy sweet, sugary, vanilla type smell that I like.</li>
            <li>This was my first time using Camille Rose products.</li>
            <li>I have gone through any products trying to find something that works on my fine hair</li>
            <li>and it works fine for me.</li>
            <li>I put my hair in medium sized twists and the results 2 days later are great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s light on the hair</li>
            <li>My rollerset curls are also light and bouncy when I use this.</li>
            <li>Absolutely fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Very smooth, pretty finish.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff,  provides great moisture without weighing the hair down.</li>

            <li>Product shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>The product came quickly.</li>
            <li>and I am a super hair care junkie.</li>
            <li>Camille Rose Naturals products in general!</li>
            <li>I may have found a new favorite.  </li>
            <li>I am always looking for better products for my natural hair, so I follow</li>
            <li>And I love how soft it remained all week.</li>
            <li>In the meantime, my hair is soft, shiny, healthy and growing.  </li>
            <li>Normally products with a strong hold have chemicals in them, and this one doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and it is not too heavy nor oily feeling which is really nice</li>
            <li>Although because its organic basically, I don&#x27;t see why it would not work great for ANYONE, who wants a little hold.  </li>
            <li>It gives great hold that isn&#x27;t hard.</li>
            <li>Great product, especially for long locs with color.</li>
            <li>First time using</li>
            <li>When I first received this product the consistency of it wasn&#x27;t exactly what I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>As a natural (3c/4A) curly girl for a couple of years now, there are three facets of a hair product that are important to me: 1)the product&#x27;s ability to define my curls, 2)</li>
            <li>I did finger coils and my hair is very soft and I am on my fourth day and loving it.</li>
            <li>I really like it and will be purchasing more in the future.</li>
            <li>My hair still looks nice the next day with this great fluffy pink cream.</li>
            <li>I use this in combo with my ren pure leave in &amp; it works wonders.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>prone, Very Tangle-y</li>
            <li>It is also very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>My hair is very moisturized with hold against the humidity.</li>
            <li>Thx so much for distributing this product.</li>
            <li>Also, the seller was very helpful and accommodating.</li>
            <li>This product works very well.</li>
            <li>stay very moisturized.</li>
            <li>This product really saved my hair.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>My daughter love the smell compare to other products I used on her hair and work well with her hair too.</li>
            <li>And to add even greater value, I don&#x27;t have to use a tone of this product or other products to do the job.  </li>
            <li>I layer it (scrunch it) in between leave-in conditioner (Kinky Curly Knot Today) and a jelly (usually Camille Rose Curl Maker).  </li>
            <li>This product along with a leave in is all I use and my hair is more moisturized, less knotted and shinier than ever before.</li>
            <li>I use mainly for damp braidouts.</li>
            <li>I get fourth and fifth day hair with both techniques and my curls are super soft, defined, and very shiny.</li>
            <li>The smell is very cake like, but not super strong.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very moisturizing and made my hair soft</li>
            <li>It smells great, works wonders, and is not too expensive.  </li>
            <li>After a lot of trial an error, I&#x27;ve found that most curl defining products are highly damaging and very few products aren&#x27;t damaging but don&#x27;t improve the quality and texture of our hair.  </li>
            <li>I have been using her Algae Renew Deep Conditioning Masque, Curl Love Milk, and Almond Jae Twisting Butter for almost a year; they work FANTASTIC on my thick curly hair!</li>
            <li>This product made my hair feel very soft.</li>
            <li>My hair was very soft, moisturizer and it had a very soft hold.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It gives me DAYS of full, fluffy, frizzles curl that is virtually tangle free (can totally just run my fingers through to remove any tiny tangles).  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a clear type of gel to use on my medium coiled kinky curly hair as a styling product.</li>
            <li>Also, the shine, sheen and softness of my hair were unexpected bonuses.</li>
            <li>This does the job well, with all natural ingredients basically.</li>
            <li>Made my hair soft.</li>
            <li>I get soft moisturized curls with a hold.</li>
            <li>I am completely natural.</li>
            <li>Hey to learn tricks and tools about natural hair.</li>
            <li>I also like that it is all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair very moisturized and my twist outs last for days!!!</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone who is natural and need lots of moisture.</li>
            <li>Works well for my natural curly hair leaving it soft but</li>
            <li>This has literally transformed  my 4b/4c natural hair.</li>
            <li>The difference is that this is all natural.</li>
            <li>So much that I will go for a second purchase.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The product came in nice packaging and was bigger than I expected, so it will last for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I actually tried this one day on my hair and used mousse on another day with the exact same results.</li>
            <li>I will be buying this product for a long time and recommend it for fluff prone dry hair :)</li>
            <li>Worked very well for my African American  hair.  </li>
            <li>The aloe vera is a major, major plus.  </li>
            <li>When I did finally get the product I ordered, it was only ok, not great.</li>
            <li>and I used this product for a dry twist up-do and it left my hair completely moisturizer!  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I did finger coils and my hair is very soft and I am on my fourth day and loving it.</li>
            <li> I really like it and will be purchasing more in the future.</li>
            <li> My hair still looks nice the next day with this great fluffy pink cream.</li>
            <li> I use this in combo with my ren pure leave in &amp; it works wonders.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> prone, Very Tangle-y</li>
            <li> It is also very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> My hair is very moisturized with hold against the humidity.</li>
            <li> Thx so much for distributing this product.</li>
            <li> Also, the seller was very helpful and accommodating.</li>
            <li> This product works very well.</li>

            <li> This product really saved my hair.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> My daughter love the smell compare to other products I used on her hair and work well with her hair too.</li>
            <li> And to add even greater value, I don&#x27;t have to use a tone of this product or other products to do the job.  </li>
            <li> I layer it (scrunch it) in between leave-in conditioner (Kinky Curly Knot Today) and a jelly (usually Camille Rose Curl Maker).  </li>
            <li> This product along with a leave in is all I use and my hair is more moisturized, less knotted and shinier than ever before.</li>
            <li> I use mainly for damp braidouts.</li>
            <li> I get fourth and fifth day hair with both techniques and my curls are super soft, defined, and very shiny.</li>
            <li> The smell is very cake like, but not super strong.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very moisturizing and made my hair soft</li>
            <li> It smells great, works wonders, and is not too expensive.  </li>
            <li> After a lot of trial an error, I&#x27;ve found that most curl defining products are highly damaging and very few products aren&#x27;t damaging but don&#x27;t improve the quality and texture of our hair.  </li>
            <li> I have been using her Algae Renew Deep Conditioning Masque, Curl Love Milk, and Almond Jae Twisting Butter for almost a year; they work FANTASTIC on my thick curly hair!</li>
            <li> This product made my hair feel very soft.</li>
            <li> My hair was very soft, moisturizer and it had a very soft hold.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It gives me DAYS of full, fluffy, frizzles curl that is virtually tangle free (can totally just run my fingers through to remove any tiny tangles).  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a clear type of gel to use on my medium coiled kinky curly hair as a styling product.</li>
            <li> Also, the shine, sheen and softness of my hair were unexpected bonuses.</li>
            <li> This does the job well, with all natural ingredients basically.</li>
            <li> Made my hair soft.</li>
            <li> I get soft moisturized curls with a hold.</li>
            <li> I am completely natural.</li>
            <li> Hey to learn tricks and tools about natural hair.</li>
            <li> I also like that it is all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair very moisturized and my twist outs last for days!!!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who is natural and need lots of moisture.</li>
            <li> Works well for my natural curly hair leaving it soft but</li>
            <li> This has literally transformed  my 4b/4c natural hair.</li>
            <li> The difference is that this is all natural.</li>
            <li> So much that I will go for a second purchase.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The product came in nice packaging and was bigger than I expected, so it will last for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I actually tried this one day on my hair and used mousse on another day with the exact same results.</li>
            <li> I will be buying this product for a long time and recommend it for fluff prone dry hair :)</li>
            <li> Worked very well for my African American  hair.  </li>
            <li> The aloe vera is a major, major plus.  </li>
            <li> When I did finally get the product I ordered, it was only ok, not great.</li>
            <li> and I used this product for a dry twist up-do and it left my hair completely moisturizer!  </li>
            <li> I have 3c (with a little 4a) sprinkled in high porosity hair.</li>
            <li> I need to restock because I will only use this for as long as it sells.</li>
            <li> It can be frustrating to find the right product to give that ultimate moisture and definition.</li>
            <li> braid it and it dry</li>
            <li> Some have said it does not work on dry hair</li>
            <li> Product made my 4a hair extremely dry.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy and works well on dry and wet hair.</li>
            <li> defined will reorder  used with two strand twist both wet and dry sets</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length layered slightly wavy red hair.</li>
            <li> Initially the smell of the product was a little overpowering, but now I am used to it.  </li>
            <li> in products that moisturize , are too heavy after only one day&#x27;s use.</li>
            <li> I only smell it in the jar, once dried on my hair</li>
            <li> Overall though, it&#x27;s not a huge disadvantage because I like that the ingredients are all-natural.</li>
            <li> However, it left my hair dry and a little too stiff.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t give an extreme amount of hold but</li>
            <li> : fluff it and bam!  </li>
            <li> I have dark brown, bra-strap length 3c/4a kinky curly hair, and I use this product to rollerset my wet hair on permrods and curlformers.</li>
            <li> I was shipped the wrong product, first of all.</li>
            <li> I am in no way a product junkie; I actually usually have problems because I don&#x27;t do enough.</li>
            <li> I am heavy handed with products, but a little goes a long way with this stuff.</li>
            <li> A little root curl, a little loose spiraling.  </li>
            <li> Plop, diffuse, or air dry (usually some combination of those three drying methods).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry hard.  </li>
            <li> I part a section put a little CR and a little olive oil,</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m going for 4 day curl, I will add a little (little) bit of harder-hold-gel.</li>
            <li> : can make the hair a little brittle feeling if not coated with castor oil or shea butter</li>
            <li> I tried to use it to slick down a ponytail but that didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> It was so strong I had to wash it out of my hair because after 1/2 hour I could still smell it to the point of being sickening.</li>
            <li> If you like a very heavy dose of vanilla scent on your hair then you will probably like this product.</li>
            <li> and although it says &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34;, it doesn&#x27;t make your hair hard</li>
            <li> Neither makes my hair hard and both keep my curls in tact.</li>
            <li> so thick and creamy.</li>
            <li> Serious miracle for my frizz</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t work well for me as a gel and has a very thick creamy consistency.</li>
            <li> and it is very thick.</li>
            <li> Used gel for a wash/go and twist out style, both failed.  </li>
            <li> I was extremely disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I really like this product. it doesn&#x27;t give an extreme amount of hold but just enough for the twist out and braid outs i do and it just feels so good on my hair. it smells like heaven too. love it</li>
            <li> Great product, especially for long locs with color.</li>
            <li> Love her products so much</li>
            <li> Camille Rose is a great product for my natural hair! I have gone through any products trying to find something that works on my fine hair and I finally found it! After I wash my hair I part a section put a little CR and a little olive oil, braid it and it dry: fluff it and bam!  I get allot of compliments on my hair. Really great product!</li>
            <li> My daughter love the smell compare to other products I used on her hair and work well with her hair too.</li>
            <li> Perfect for twist outs! so thick and creamy. It smells great too!</li>
            <li> Does well to help moisturizer my hair.  I use this in combo with my ren pure leave in &amp; it works wonders.  3b/3c hair</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It smells delicious and does a great job of moisturizing my hair for any style! Also, the shine, sheen and softness of my hair were unexpected bonuses.</li>
            <li> Great, great product.  Worked very well for my African American  hair.  Although because its organic basically, I don&#x27;t see why it would not work great for ANYONE, who wants a little hold.  This does the job well, with all natural ingredients basically. The aloe vera is a major, major plus.  No alcohol.  It doesn&#x27;t dry hard.  Very smooth, pretty finish.  Very nice smell.  I really like it and will be purchasing more in the future.</li>
            <li> Second time ordering and as always its still loved by my curly mane. I absolutely love this line for all my curl enhancing needs.</li>
            <li> Made my hair soft. Elongated my curls. The gel held everything in place, I would definitely purchase this product again</li>
            <li> Product shipped quickly. First time using and I love it.</li>
            <li> This product is perfect for the dry winter months. I use it as a styler over my olive oil and leave in conditioner. I get soft moisturized curls with a hold. My hair keeps it&#x27;s curls for 3 to 4 days without me having to redo my bantu knots. The smell is very cake like, but not super strong. It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy and works well on dry and wet hair. It is my go to product when I want perfect curls. I am heavy handed with products, but a little goes a long way with this stuff. It last me several months. I have 4a, b,c hair.</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY product that allows me to do a twist out.  I am able to get 3 day hair every time.</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE Camille Rose Naturals products in general! I have been using her Algae Renew Deep Conditioning Masque, Curl Love Milk, and Almond Jae Twisting Butter for almost a year; they work FANTASTIC on my thick curly hair! As always, this product smells like cupcakes. I wanted to try it since I do not use gel on my hair but this works great with my hair. Some have said it does not work on dry hair but I have tried it on both and it works fine for me. It is great to style twist outs, braid outs, buns, etc. It has just the right amount of hold and it does not leave a flaky trail like most gels when it dries! I recommend this product for any and everyone! :)</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff!  It gives great definition without crunchiness.  Initially the smell of the product was a little overpowering, but now I am used to it.  I will definitely repurchase it again.</li>
            <li> I have 3c,4a,4b and 4c hair type. It can be frustrating to find the right product to give that ultimate moisture and definition. I use this moisture curlaide  for twisting. It stretches my curls and leaves it so moisturized. Love it. Will try curl maker next.</li>
            <li> Best product for my twist-outs thus far. Best used on my hair when it is dry</li>
            <li> My hair is solidly WAVY.  A little root curl, a little loose spiraling.  Basically, wavy.  Not straight, not &amp;#34;curly,&amp;#34; but my hair is naturally (2c) wavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And my hair LOVES this product with a great and mighty love!!!!  I layer it (scrunch it) in between leave-in conditioner (Kinky Curly Knot Today) and a jelly (usually Camille Rose Curl Maker).  If I&#x27;m going for 4 day curl, I will add a little (little) bit of harder-hold-gel. Plop, diffuse, or air dry (usually some combination of those three drying methods).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It gives me DAYS of full, fluffy, frizzles curl that is virtually tangle free (can totally just run my fingers through to remove any tiny tangles).  Serious miracle for my frizz prone, Very Tangle-y hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love, love, love, love, love, love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonus: it smells like birthday cupcakes.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff. I am completely natural. I used it to do a curlformers set. It gives great hold that isn&#x27;t hard. It is also very moisturizing. I tried to use it to slick down a ponytail but that didn&#x27;t work. I use it to do a curlformers set. The set lasts me about four days and then I put it in a ponytail. There is never any flaking or build up from this product. All in all I will be repurchasing.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this stuff. Great moisturizer!</li>
            <li> Pros: it smells great&lt;br /&gt;detangles&lt;br /&gt;has loads of slip&lt;br /&gt;helps straighter styles hold&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: can make the hair a little brittle feeling if not coated with castor oil or shea butter</li>
            <li> This product made my hair feel very soft.</li>
            <li> Twists come out great with this!</li>
            <li> The product came quickly. I have 3c (with a little 4a) sprinkled in high porosity hair. I put my hair in medium sized twists and the results 2 days later are great. My hair is very moisturized with hold against the humidity. Although I didn&#x27;t use this product alone (it was incorporated as the cream in the LOC method) I will be buying this product for a long time and recommend it for fluff prone dry hair :)</li>
            <li> I am always looking for better products for my natural hair, so I follow Hey Fran Hey to learn tricks and tools about natural hair. She had been talking about Camille Rose for a while, so I wanted to try it out and I can honestly say that I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s light on the hair and although it says &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34;, it doesn&#x27;t make your hair hard but it keeps the curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it&#x27;s just like whipped cream and smells amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product came in nice packaging and was bigger than I expected, so it will last for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> Love it!!! Thx so much for distributing this product.</li>
            <li> If you like a very heavy dose of vanilla scent on your hair then you will probably like this product. It was so strong I had to wash it out of my hair because after 1/2 hour I could still smell it to the point of being sickening. I did like the feel of the cream and it did a good job of curl defining. Also, the seller was very helpful and accommodating. I also like that it is all natural ingredients. I just need to find a product without scent. If this aspect doesn&#x27;t bother you then I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> My favorite hair product of all time and I am a super hair care junkie.</li>
            <li> Very good curl defined for natural hair</li>
            <li> Love this product on my hair feels nice and soft and no white residue got a nice three day twist out that still looked good on the fourth day......</li>
            <li> I used the Camille rose whipped aloe butter to set my hair using flex rods, and it turned out great. My hair was very soft, moisturizer and it had a very soft hold. However, my set lasted over a week.  And I love how soft it remained all week.</li>
            <li> This has to be the best hair butter/gel I have ever used!!! It leaves my hair very moisturized and my twist outs last for days!!! I only re-twist to stretch out my wash days. I would recommend this to anyone with 4c hair that needs moisture!!! The smell is amazing too!!!!!</li>
            <li> Smells amazing.  Arrived in a timely fashion.  Haven&#x27;t quite figured out what product it goes well with it but it smells really nice...</li>
            <li> This is really nice. Gives my natural African-American hair wonderful definition and hold. The coconut scent lingers until I wash it out. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This product smells amazing and adds tons of moisture to my natural curls.  Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I have dark brown, bra-strap length 3c/4a kinky curly hair, and I use this product to rollerset my wet hair on permrods and curlformers. My hair comes out shiny and moisturized every time. My rollerset curls are also light and bouncy when I use this. This whipped butter also smells so yummy, like a cupcake! It&#x27;s a thicker consistency, almost like cake batter. The reason I took off a star is because I wish the hold of this product were a wee bit stronger. When I rollerset with this whipped butter, my curls last for one day, and then I have to pincurl or re-set my hair the next night. Overall though, it&#x27;s not a huge disadvantage because I like that the ingredients are all-natural. Normally products with a strong hold have chemicals in them, and this one doesn&#x27;t. I also love the way my hair smells after using this.</li>
            <li> Yes I like this product a lot. It&#x27;s very moisturizing and made my hair soft I would recommend this to anyone who is natural and need lots of moisture.</li>
            <li> Works well for my natural curly hair leaving it soft but defined will reorder  used with two strand twist both wet and dry sets</li>
            <li> I saw this product on a hair blog and thought I would try it out ! I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> When I first received this product the consistency of it wasn&#x27;t exactly what I thought it would be. I was looking for a clear type of gel to use on my medium coiled kinky curly hair as a styling product. This product didn&#x27;t work well for me as a gel and has a very thick creamy consistency. Although it may not make a great holding gel for wash-n-go wear, it does however work perfectly as a creme moisturizer for those with thirsty hair. It also works exceptionally well for me when I do twist outs, and it leaves my hair feeling and looking very moisturized and well defined. I also love the smell, which is a creamy sweet, sugary, vanilla type smell that I like.</li>
            <li> I was shipped the wrong product, first of all. When I did finally get the product I ordered, it was only ok, not great. I wouldn&#x27;t reorder it again for my hair -- not enough hold and makes hair sticky next day.</li>
            <li> Probably the best product I have ever used in my hair. I have 3b/3c hair with low porosity. I have used the curlaid moisture butter on both wash and gos (the moisturize butter and then aloe Vera to seal) and with twist outs (kinky curly knot today leave in, the moisture butter, and coconut oil to seal) and both have giving me perfect results. I get fourth and fifth day hair with both techniques and my curls are super soft, defined, and very shiny. I have always had a problem with dryness but this product has saved my hair. I need to restock because I will only use this for as long as it sells.</li>
            <li> I was extremely disappointed. Used gel for a wash/go and twist out style, both failed.  Product made my 4a hair extremely dry.</li>
            <li> This has literally transformed  my 4b/4c natural hair. I am in no way a product junkie; I actually usually have problems because I don&#x27;t do enough. This product along with a leave in is all I use and my hair is more moisturized, less knotted and shinier than ever before. I will be buying this forever! I cannot over emphasize how great this product is for my hair.</li>
            <li> This was my first time using Camille Rose products. I have 3C hair and it is very thick. I did finger coils and my hair is very soft and I am on my fourth day and loving it. I would recommend this product.  Great results</li>
            <li> This product works very well. Keeps my curly hair stay very moisturized. It has good ingredients and smells great too!</li>
            <li> Excellent product, I love it!! I am now a customer for life, leaves my hair silky and smelling absolutely amazing!!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely fantastic.  Made my hair soft and my bantu knot twist outs were perfect.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product! As a natural (3c/4A) curly girl for a couple of years now, there are three facets of a hair product that are important to me: 1)the product&#x27;s ability to define my curls, 2) the product doesn&#x27;t damage my hair, and 3) the product&#x27;s ability to improve my hair.  After a lot of trial an error, I&#x27;ve found that most curl defining products are highly damaging and very few products aren&#x27;t damaging but don&#x27;t improve the quality and texture of our hair.  This product is truly the exception from that perspective. And to add even greater value, I don&#x27;t have to use a tone of this product or other products to do the job.  I co-wash my hair once a week, detangle it every morning while showering, use a quarter size amount of a leave in conditioner then the aloe whipped hair gel and THAT&#x27;s IT!  In the meantime, my hair is soft, shiny, healthy and growing.  Need I say more!</li>
            <li> I purchased tthis product to use on my twist outs. The product has a good smell and felt creamy when applied. However, it left my hair dry and a little too stiff. I would not repurchase this product.</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length layered slightly wavy red hair. This wonderful product looks and feels as nice as it smells. It makes my hair shiny, gives it body and holds  a very nice wave. A wonderful product for me as my hair is color treated and I swim ( which kills hair!)&lt;br /&gt;I am absolutely delighted with this product. I have fine hair and it is not too heavy nor oily feeling which is really nice as many leave- in products that moisturize , are too heavy after only one day&#x27;s use. My hair still looks nice the next day with this great fluffy pink cream. It looks edible-but don&#x27;t eat it! Instead let everyone you know smell you hair!</li>
            <li> This smells really great. I use it for my twist out and wash-n-gos. It holds without the crunchiness of gel and leaves it feeling moisturized. I use it as a styler over leave-in conditioner. It smells like Vanilla pudding. I didn&#x27;t give it five stars because the smells doesn&#x27;t last. I only smell it in the jar, once dried on my hair the smell is gone.</li>
            <li> The best moisturizer and styler for my 4C hair. I use mainly for damp braidouts.</li>
            <li> excellant product for African American hair</li>
            <li> Shipping was amazing from aveyou.. Love camille rose I use it this product as a leave in with coconut oil and olive oil. This product really saved my hair. Leaves my hair moisturized for a week. Thank you camille rose</li>
            <li> I actually tried this one day on my hair and used mousse on another day with the exact same results. Neither makes my hair hard and both keep my curls in tact. The difference is that this is all natural. I&#x27;m a fan</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  So much that I will go for a second purchase.  I am a 3c\4a curly girl and I used this product for a dry twist up-do and it left my hair completely moisturizer!  I may have found a new favorite.  It smells great, works wonders, and is not too expensive.  Did I mention it smells great?  My coworkers kept commenting on how good my hair smelled when I walked by.  I would recommend this product to all the curly girls.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff,  provides great moisture without weighing the hair down.</li>
