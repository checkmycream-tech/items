            <li>Nice cosplay wig for price</li>
            <li>The quality is really nice.</li>
            <li>Very workable and fits great!</li>
            <li>and I trimmed the bangs a bit but even before then it was very accurate.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very comfortable</li>
            <li>I am not 100% sure on that.</li>
            <li>I would totally recommend it to you :D</li>
            <li>I bought a wig for my Levi cosplay and it was fantastic!</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not too sure since I haven&#x27;t worn</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this wig.</li>
            <li>Very nice, 10/10 would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>All in all its a pretty good wig.</li>
            <li>Ok, so this wig was pretty nice, good quality, doesn&#x27;t shed, right color.</li>
            <li>Other wise this wig is pretty good, it will work good for my Levi Cosplay.</li>
            <li>It was a very good price for it too, The wig has a undercut which is totally cool because it looks like it&#x27;s your actual hair, but if you happened to have very light hair and took my response</li>
            <li>but overall it&#x27;s a really good product!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always a mess when I try to buy the perfect wig.</li>
            <li>Okay, so it didn&#x27;t take that long and the color is very nice</li>
            <li>but I did a little bit of straightening and it was perfect.</li>
            <li>I have bought wigs for $30 and they look cheap.</li>
            <li>and it amazingly looks like real hair.</li>
            <li>The style was pretty much as shown, which is good.</li>
            <li>so you Really need to look at the picture really good because it&#x27;s exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li>the wig hardly even needed to be cut and after a trim it looks great!</li>
            <li>but the wig does overall feel really nice and is of great quality especially for the price.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>and I stay pretty cool in it.  </li>
            <li>But other than that it&#x27;s an awesome wig totally.</li>
            <li>You may need to do quite a bit of styling if you want to get it to look just right</li>
            <li>is just right</li>
            <li>You might have to do the same, but that&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>Let me just say from my research that if you are Cosplaying Levi that you WILL need to trim your wig, because they don&#x27;t really make the wigs right pretty much anywhere you get them.</li>
            <li>for the price it is perfect my only complaint is that it was wayyyy to poofy for my tastes as a levi wig.</li>
            <li>The wig looks pretty real to me too.</li>
            <li>To be honest, I was just looking for a black wig that I could cut.  </li>
            <li>, it looks/feels like real hair...</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s a warning though; it is very poofy.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect much when I read the reviews of others.</li>
            <li>Very nice Levi wig very soft and it only needed a little trimming</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the wig, just a little trimming and it&#x27;ll be all set.</li>
            <li>Also the back of it on the right side wasn&#x27;t cut right and needed to be trimmed to match the left side.</li>
            <li>hair was thick (as in layered) and very soft, it didn&#x27;t smell (it actually smelled pretty nice.</li>
            <li>However the wig isn&#x27;t very soft.</li>
            <li>If I unhook the size adjustment straps, I&#x27;m able to get it on, though I&#x27;m not sure how well it would stay on.</li>
            <li>It is the correct color but the cut is not any where near Levi</li>
            <li>The wig is brown, not black.</li>
            <li>The wig also needs to be trimmed in other areas to get it to look right.</li>
            <li>I sent them a message about the problem, but they only replied saying: &amp;#34;The main color of this item is black and there are only a light brown.</li>
            <li>The hair itself is a bit shiny (easily modified), but the wig itself is tight on my head -- my hair is long.</li>
            <li>it actually looks quite natural.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t just a solid brown or a solid black, but rather a mixture of dark browns and blacks to give it a smooth, natural hair color.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve purchased more than one wig in the past and understand that they sometimes need a little trimming, but this wig I recieved was definitely Mikasa&#x27;s, not Levi&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s slightly bulky and the hair is very rough up to at the part but the rest of it&#x27;s pretty soft.  </li>

            <li> Ok, so this wig was pretty nice, good quality, doesn&#x27;t shed, right color. However the wig isn&#x27;t very soft. Also the back of it on the right side wasn&#x27;t cut right and needed to be trimmed to match the left side. The wig also needs to be trimmed in other areas to get it to look right. Let me just say from my research that if you are Cosplaying Levi that you WILL need to trim your wig, because they don&#x27;t really make the wigs right pretty much anywhere you get them. But if you are going to trim it be extremely careful and look up tutorials on how to trim wigs. Other wise this wig is pretty good, it will work good for my Levi Cosplay.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s usable, but it looks nothing like from the picture.</li>
            <li> Okay, so it didn&#x27;t take that long and the color is very nice but, the length of the wig is very long. Of course, I knew when I ordered it that it would be long, the other people said it just needs trimmed. But, I&#x27;ve never trimmed before in my life. So, this was an experience. Having to cut it to length is a challenge,so think about it when buying. But, overall it isn&#x27;t a bad purchase.</li>
            <li> for the price it is perfect my only complaint is that it was wayyyy to poofy for my tastes as a levi wig. had to do major styling to get the poofyness down. but the wig does overall feel really nice and is of great quality especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the wig, just a little trimming and it&#x27;ll be all set. It was a very good price for it too, The wig has a undercut which is totally cool because it looks like it&#x27;s your actual hair, but if you happened to have very light hair and took my response I am not 100% sure on that.

            <li> Nice cosplay wig for price</li>
            <li> This wig is black you can straighten is and it&#x27;s thick but the only problem I have with it is that it needed a cut in the back to be like Levi&#x27;s so you Really need to look at the picture really good because it&#x27;s exactly like the picture. But other than that it&#x27;s an awesome wig totally.</li>
            <li> the wig hardly even needed to be cut and after a trim it looks great! it actually looks quite natural.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always a mess when I try to buy the perfect wig. I bought a wig for my Levi cosplay and it was fantastic! It looked amazing for the price I bought it for. I have bought wigs for $30 and they look cheap. I bought mine on sale for $15-20 (I forgot what the price was, but I bought it after black Friday so it was an awesome deal) and it looks fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;I had to trim mine to get the look I preferred. You might have to do the same, but that&#x27;s okay. If you have never trimmed a wig before just go on youtube for some great wig trimming tips.&lt;br /&gt;The hair was thick (as in layered) and very soft, it didn&#x27;t smell (it actually smelled pretty nice. Is that weird?), and the colors were very natural looking. It wasn&#x27;t just a solid brown or a solid black, but rather a mixture of dark browns and blacks to give it a smooth, natural hair color. Very nice, 10/10 would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> The wig is brown, not black. It was also fluffier than I thought, but I cut it and the result was pleasant.</li>
            <li> The quality is really nice. Here&#x27;s a warning though; it is very poofy. You may need to do quite a bit of styling if you want to get it to look just right and also it needs a bit of a trim.&lt;br /&gt;The color is just right and it amazingly looks like real hair. If you&#x27;re going for 100% accuracy though, you may have to spend quite a bit of work on styling.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Levi wig for my cosplay and they sent me Mikasa&#x27;s wig. I sent them a message about the problem, but they only replied saying: &amp;#34;The main color of this item is black and there are only a light brown. This is the design for the item.&amp;#34; I don&#x27;t know if anyone else had a similar problem, but I found it annoying they sent me the wrong wig. They told me I was the confused one in the situation. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be purchasing from them again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I&#x27;ve purchased more than one wig in the past and understand that they sometimes need a little trimming, but this wig I recieved was definitely Mikasa&#x27;s, not Levi&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much when I read the reviews of others. To be honest, I was just looking for a black wig that I could cut.  I was sent a generic black wig. Not only generic but also bad quality. It&#x27;s probably going to shed a lot but I&#x27;m not too sure since I haven&#x27;t worn it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I decided to cut it for a Marco cosplay but if you&#x27;re looking for a styled Levi wig, keep looking.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this wig. It came in 11 days after I ordered it, I was so worried it wasn&#x27;t going to come in time for a convention, but it did! It was a little poofy but I did a little bit of straightening and it was perfect. The length of the bangs and undercut was perfect. Great wig.</li>
            <li> Not the best Levi wig around, but it&#x27;s alright! Hard to style a bit, but over all well.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for a freind since she adores levi and she said it was amazing!</li>
            <li> Great product. Well worth the money. A bit slow to ship so allow time for it to get to you.</li>
            <li> Best wig I have ever invested in.</li>
            <li> Very workable and fits great!</li>
            <li> It is a very bad wig. It is the correct color but the cut is not any where near Levi</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s slightly bulky and the hair is very rough up to at the part but the rest of it&#x27;s pretty soft.  It required minimal styling because one side was a bit longer than the other and I trimmed the bangs a bit but even before then it was very accurate.  The back gives you plently of room if you wish to style it shorter to get the buzz look he has but I haven&#x27;t attempted it with mine.  I&#x27;ll probably keep it like it is now.  It&#x27;s very comfortable and I stay pretty cool in it.  All in all its a pretty good wig.</li>
            <li> Very nice Levi wig very soft and it only needed a little trimming</li>
