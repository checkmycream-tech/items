            <li>Awesome!</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t the best smelling patchouli.  </li>
            <li>Genuine patchouli scent, smells great and fills the bathroom up with a great smell.  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I had to buy twice as much Zum Patchouli for home and our vacations to keep him happy too!  </li>
            <li>this by far is THE best Patchouli body wash I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Patchouli &amp;#34;snob&amp;#34; here and by far the best scent I have ever found.</li>
            <li>I Love this product for two reasons;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;it&#x27;s so exotic</li>
            <li>Great Price, fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Love the fragrance.</li>
            <li>Soap smells great!&lt;br /&gt;The top was off the bottle so most of the soap leaked out of the package before it got to me.</li>
            <li>This soap is an excellent blend of natural oils and such that leave you with a clean feeling, moisturized skin and a wonderful lingering patchouli scent.  </li>
            <li>A very unique product.</li>
            <li>Patchouli can be a very strong essential oil and can easily fill a room if it is too strong, the amount in this soap is perfect.  </li>
            <li>Great soap, great smell BUT push-down dispenser broke (split) half way through bottle...</li>
            <li>I have gotten many compliments on smelling nice and really don&#x27;t even need to use perfume.  </li>
            <li>Not as &#x27;sweet&#x27; as most.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t many soaps that are really good for your skin and also make your inner hippie smile!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fine wash as it it gets you clean ..</li>
            <li>I love it, at first I didnt like the smell</li>
            <li>Great smell, doesn&#x27;t dry out my hands.</li>
            <li>and it just didn&#x27;t clean.</li>
            <li>Thankfully it doesnt stay and all that&#x27;s left is a pleasant patchouli.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend it because of the fragrance and good lather, plus if all-natural ingredients is your thing, then go for it.  </li>
            <li>v strong fragrance doesn&#x27;t dry skin - wish it foamed up more</li>
            <li>All Zum Wash products are high quality, natural - their bar soaps are fantastic too!</li>
            <li>And lo and behold, my husband wants to smell like heaven too!</li>
            <li>I love the lasting patchouli scent.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the real essence of patchouli&lt;</li>
            <li>After you use it and its not straight from the container it smells much better.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell much like Pachouli.</li>
            <li>smells more like wet wood.  </li>
            <li>I love the woodsy smell of this Zum wash and was so surprised when 2 ladies I work with use it often and bought it for their teenage DAUGHTERS!  </li>
            <li>Just a little strong but I like it</li>
            <li>If you like patchouli and a natural moisturizing soap, I highly recommend Indigo Wild Zum Wash Liquid Soap, Patchouli.  </li>
            <li>I bought it for my 18 and 21 year old sons, and even they thought it was a little strong.  </li>
            <li>I like the body cream also but am an outside sales rep and a few people complain about the scent being too strong!  </li>
            <li>I also like the products because they are Natural.</li>
            <li>- it reminds me of some natural oil or something.  </li>
            <li>and i think if a lady want to lure anyone just use this soap, this is the secret of seduction:))</li>
            <li>NOT THE USUAL ZUM PATCHOULI SCENT I AM USED TO VERY FAST SHIPPER</li>

            <li> I Love this product for two reasons;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 st it&#x27;s patchouli&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 nd it&#x27;s the real essence of patchouli&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s so exotic and i think if a lady want to lure anyone just use this soap, this is the secret of seduction:))</li>
            <li> I have used this product for quite some time but the local stores have stopped carrying this scent.  I suppose they consider it too &amp;#34;hippie-ish&amp;#34; .  I like the body cream also but am an outside sales rep and a few people complain about the scent being too strong!  I think they would complain about anything.  I also like the products because they are Natural.</li>
            <li> this by far is THE best Patchouli body wash I have ever used. Great Price, fast shipping. Patchouli &amp;#34;snob&amp;#34; here and by far the best scent I have ever found. All Zum Wash products are high quality, natural - their bar soaps are fantastic too!</li>
            <li> Genuine patchouli scent, smells great and fills the bathroom up with a great smell.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I like smelling like heaven...I like having the bathroom smell like heaven. And lo and behold, my husband wants to smell like heaven too! I had to buy twice as much Zum Patchouli for home and our vacations to keep him happy too!  Not complaining.  Would you complain if your husband smelled like heaven?</li>
            <li> NOT THE USUAL ZUM PATCHOULI SCENT I AM USED TO VERY FAST SHIPPER</li>
            <li> Product received in a timely manner. Love the fragrance.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fine wash as it it gets you clean .. but the scent is a bit off putting.  It has a creaminess in the aroma that is hard to get used to - it reminds me of some natural oil or something.  I cant quite put my finger on it. Thankfully it doesnt stay and all that&#x27;s left is a pleasant patchouli.</li>
            <li> Patchouli scent is muddy. A disappointing purchase.</li>
            <li> I love it, at first I didnt like the smell it&#x27;s like its patchouli mixed with something else...  After you use it and its not straight from the container it smells much better.  I would like to try a couple different ones, but I will probably get it again.</li>
            <li> I love the woodsy smell of this Zum wash and was so surprised when 2 ladies I work with use it often and bought it for their teenage DAUGHTERS!

            <li> Awesome! Great smell, doesn&#x27;t dry out my hands.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell much like Pachouli.</li>
            <li> While it had a slight patchouli smell, when I used it, it had an odd almond-scent and it just didn&#x27;t clean. It should only be marketed as a hand soap, not a body soap</li>
            <li> Just a little strong but I like it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a patchouli fanatic.  This isn&#x27;t the best smelling patchouli.  Not as &#x27;sweet&#x27; as most.  Will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> v strong fragrance doesn&#x27;t dry skin - wish it foamed up more</li>
            <li> Great soap, great smell BUT push-down dispenser broke (split) half way through bottle... 1/2 soap is wasted.</li>
            <li> smells more like wet wood.  also made my skin itch.  I did like the fact it was a liquid.</li>
            <li> This soap is an excellent blend of natural oils and such that leave you with a clean feeling, moisturized skin and a wonderful lingering patchouli scent.  I have been using it for a few weeks and have noticed that my skin is much less dry yet not greasy or oily.  I love the lasting patchouli scent.
