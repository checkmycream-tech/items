            <li> Love my LA Girl Concealer</li>
            <li> It is usually hard to find LA girl pro concealer in fawn - so I love this purchase.</li>
            <li> I loved it, no creasing at all, it goes on easy. I would order this again</li>
            <li> I purchased this because of reviews on Youtube. I don&#x27;t think it compares to MAC concealer by any means, but it is a good concealer. I wear NC 50 foundation in MAC and used this for highlighting my under eye area. Works just find for the cost.</li>
            <li> Love it a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> Love this product it really give you that highlighting feeling</li>
            <li> Omg love this it covers everything  ðŸ’œ</li>
            <li> Great product I been using it for months(I have ALL the colors minus three of the LIGHTEST SHADES) and it&#x27;s better then most high end concealers. I&#x27;ll reach for this to highlight or conceal before I even think about My MAC concealers. Great quality , great applicator ,great coverage ...doesn&#x27;t really crease unless u set undereye with Ben bye banana powder(for me at least) but it plays well with others. Packaged as shown in pic above ,came quickly, in great condition ,FAV CONCEALER OF ALL TIME!!!!</li>
            <li> This is better than most high brow concealers. Perfect!</li>
            <li> I use this all the time.. great coverage and stay!!  non greasy and goes on easily</li>
            <li> Love them! Been trying to get my hands on &amp;#34;Fawn&amp;#34; for a while now and they are always sold out at my local beauty supply! Matches perfectly.</li>
            <li> Fantastic Concealer HANDS DOWN!</li>
            <li> My favorite concealer</li>
