            <li>love this product..wouldnt be without it!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>Best primer to use for people who have large pores.  </li>
            <li>After watching the amazing Cassandra Bankson video on Youtube (makeup she uses for cystic acne), I discovered there was something called Photo Finish Foundation Primer, which you put on under your foundation</li>
            <li>Nice product; makes makeup go on smoothly and feels great on my face.</li>
            <li>This silicone cream puts a poreless, silky matte finish that is nicely topped with just powder.</li>
            <li>It can be used alone, but honestly if you want nice even coverage, this is a must use base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, my face stays nice just for 4 or 5 hours and when it doesn&#x27;t, is a matter of 1 hour or even 30 minutes and the oil of my face starts to be visible.</li>
            <li>Excellent product, as the title claims, it makes your skin feel very soft, as silk (not velvet!)  </li>
            <li>DHC Skin Coat is by far the best skin primer I have ever used!</li>
            <li>And wow, my makeup looked so great &amp; it seemed as if I had a glow!</li>
            <li>its worth the amount and great for Christmas gift for anyone who loves make up or dabbles with it</li>
            <li>Love Love Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Now it has to be a special occasion for me to wear makeup because the Velvet Skin makes my face look so good.</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin feeling clean and smooth all day as well as giving me great coverage all day.</li>
            <li>Very cheap.</li>
            <li>it leaves you face very smooth not shiny.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>DHC Velvet Skin Coat is a face primer; the smooth &amp;#34;canvas&amp;#34; it provides for foundation will surprise you!</li>

            <li>Look forward to trying more.</li>
            <li>and I love the look and feel</li>
            <li>It is supposed to be an undercoat that you put makeup on top of.  </li>
            <li>I have used much better primers than this one.</li>
            <li>I have oily skin and most days</li>
            <li>It goes on like velvet, clear (no color) and so smooth, providing the best foundation for corrective cream, concealer and eye makeup</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t ask for better than &amp;#34;perfect.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>I love it and will reorder</li>
            <li>but I was admittedly in love with the name \\&quot;Smashbox.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I love the Smashbox Photo Finish</li>
            <li>I love it a lot.</li>

            <li>This is one of my favorite skin care products; it makes my skin feel softer.</li>
            <li>used for 20 years or more.......</li>
            <li>When you apply it before applying your makeup it makes you skin look so much better, the wrinkles virtually disappear.</li>

            <li>Love this stuff - everything I&#x27;ve tried is STICKY and this combats that - leaves my skin smooth and almost silky</li>
            <li>This makes makeup glide on easily and without caking.</li>
            <li>It hides fine lines around my mouth, under eyes and erases pores.  </li>

            <li>Smooth, silky preparation for make up.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my skin so smooth and my make up just glides on smoothly.  </li>
            <li>I have light skin and freckles.  </li>
            <li>This product helps with making a smooth surface before you put on makeup.</li>

            <li>No heaviness, so light you don&#x27;t notice it&#x27;s on.</li>
            <li>I truly enjoy this product and will continue to use it.  </li>
            <li>Smooth and silky on face.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Use sparingly on a clean face or after moisturizer.</li>
            <li>This is great stuff, but not much in the tube.</li>
            <li>I have always loved DHC, especially this product.</li>
            <li>It is allergy season, so I can&#x27;t be sure this product is the whole cause of the irritation.</li>
            <li>I love this primer for the skin, and I&#x27;m a older woman.</li>
            <li>I received another a quick ordered it.</li>
            <li>This product is fabulous and it certainly feels like velvet.</li>
            <li>The old primer is 3 times better.</li>
            <li>For me, it&#x27;s well worth the money . . .</li>
            <li>Or it&#x27;s worth a read on what this makeup is.</li>
            <li>That being said, it&#x27;s still worth it, and I don&#x27;t feel that way about a lot of cosmetics.</li>
            <li>I had purchased this from a catalog several years ago and liked it very much.</li>
            <li>It evens out your skin color and leaves it feeling very soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to use very much.  </li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t very much in the tube</li>
            <li>but you don&#x27;t need very much to cover your face.</li>
            <li>Awesome product; unbelievable!!!</li>
            <li>Not only was my face incredibly silky, but it filled in all the little lines &amp; larger pores around my eyes, nose &amp; mouth so that my makeup just glided on this velvety smooth surface.</li>
            <li>It makes my face feels so soft and smooth and doesn&#x27;t make it feel oily at all.</li>
            <li>Somedays it works pretty well</li>
            <li>I received it really fast!</li>
            <li>IT HAS SUCH A SILKY SMOOTH COAT!</li>
            <li>I just wish it came in a larger tube (some of us just need more help than others).</li>
            <li>Makes your skin feel so smooth and young feeling.  </li>
            <li>I had a trial offer and decided to purchase and was sa great choice.. dont use everyday not to waste.. love it..</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for a long time and love it.  </li>
            <li>Actually, the product is colorless, but it does exactly what it claims to do - smooth out and conceal pores before makeup application.  </li>
            <li>I consider this an essential make-up product that enhances any foundation and smooths over fine lines.</li>
            <li>I discovered this wonderful product years ago but was hesitate to buy it anywhere other than directly from DHC for fear that it would be less a quality than otherwise.  </li>
            <li>Makes my makeup seem extra smooth.</li>
            <li>I received it really fast.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product at my wife&#x27;s request (She doesn&#x27;t like to use the internet much).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s velvety smooth on my skin &amp; helps my makeup last longer.</li>
            <li>It did not clog my pores and was very helpful in avoiding getting my makeup into some acne scars which has always been a problem.  </li>
            <li>but dont get much in the tube.</li>
            <li>I apply after my moisturer and it really makes a difference in the look.</li>
            <li>I really really don&#x27;t know my feelings about this primer.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>If your not that old but would like to have your skin feel smooth and soft, you should try it.</li>
            <li>When it seems like the tube is empty, I cut the top off and find enough of the product for SEVERAL more applications.  </li>
            <li>It has a dry feel when you rub it between your fingers &amp; it spreads on your face so smoothly.</li>
            <li>but the fact she was older than I am without a sign of wrinkles convinced to try it.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money and if you want a good primer, this product will definitely do the job.  </li>
            <li>It is clear and goes on instantly, making your face feel instantly smooth.</li>
            <li>This product really leaves your face feeing soft and looking</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchase a few more tubes.</li>
            <li>I would  highly recommend this product  to those who want their skin to feel like brand new...</li>
            <li>Feels good for a few minutes and then skin feels to dry.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin around my eyes and it appears to irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>(and I&#x27;m very old).</li>
            <li>The fine lines around my eyes seems less.  </li>
            <li>I used this once and was completely sold!</li>
            <li>I am normally a big cheapo especially when it comes to beauty products but this is worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to have received a sample of this product a while back.</li>
            <li>Feels so soft.  </li>
            <li>It makes my skin fell so soft and silky.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel so soft and softens out the wrinkles..</li>
            <li>and I need to use enough to cover my whole face and neck.</li>
            <li>Works nearly as well as Lancôme.  </li>
            <li>but I can not use it on daily bases because it clogs pores to much and makes me brake out.</li>
            <li>Makes your skin feel so soft.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin soft as a baby</li>
            <li>no one could believe I was that old.</li>
            <li>It made my skin feel so soft and silky while giving a matte finish.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe my skin can feel so soft.  </li>
            <li>Excellent base with or without makeup.</li>
            <li>I save the Lancôme for special occasions and use the Velvet Skin Coat everyday.  </li>
            <li>didnot make skin as smooth and velvety as sample did, not satisfied at all</li>
            <li>It really does work, even o my aging, dry furrowed looking face.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really do anything , feels dry going on, when makeup is put over</li>
            <li>it actually makes the skin feel soft and young again....</li>
            <li>If you haven&#x27;t tried anything like this and just fell into this category of makeup, like me, it&#x27;s worth a little one-time purchase and you&#x27;ll probably stick with it.</li>
            <li>It looks sort of like a translucent white in the tube and goes on clear, so eliminate that color question since there are no choices anyway.  </li>
            <li>I recently had my old lady birthday party and</li>

            <li> It keeps my skin feeling clean and smooth all day as well as giving me great coverage all day.</li>
            <li> Very cheap.</li>
            <li> it leaves you face very smooth not shiny.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> DHC Velvet Skin Coat is a face primer; the smooth &amp;#34;canvas&amp;#34; it provides for foundation will surprise you!</li>
            <li> I am returning to it more often.</li>

            <li> and I love the look and feel</li>
            <li> It is supposed to be an undercoat that you put makeup on top of.  </li>
            <li> I have used much better primers than this one.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and most days</li>
            <li> It goes on like velvet, clear (no color) and so smooth, providing the best foundation for corrective cream, concealer and eye makeup</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t ask for better than &amp;#34;perfect.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> I love it and will reorder</li>
            <li> but I was admittedly in love with the name \\&quot;Smashbox.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I love the Smashbox Photo Finish</li>
            <li> I love it a lot.</li>

            <li> This makes makeup glide on easily and without caking.</li>

            <li> I truly enjoy this product and will continue to use it.  </li>
            <li> Smooth and silky on face.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Use sparingly on a clean face or after moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff, but not much in the tube.</li>
            <li> I have always loved DHC, especially this product.</li>
            <li> It is allergy season, so I can&#x27;t be sure this product is the whole cause of the irritation.</li>
            <li> I love this primer for the skin, and I&#x27;m a older woman.</li>
            <li> I received another a quick ordered it.</li>
            <li> This product is fabulous and it certainly feels like velvet.</li>
            <li> The old primer is 3 times better.</li>
            <li> For me, it&#x27;s well worth the money . . .</li>
            <li> Or it&#x27;s worth a read on what this makeup is.</li>
            <li> That being said, it&#x27;s still worth it, and I don&#x27;t feel that way about a lot of cosmetics.</li>
            <li> I had purchased this from a catalog several years ago and liked it very much.</li>
            <li> It evens out your skin color and leaves it feeling very soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to use very much.  </li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t very much in the tube</li>
            <li> but you don&#x27;t need very much to cover your face.</li>
            <li> Awesome product; unbelievable!!!</li>
            <li> Not only was my face incredibly silky, but it filled in all the little lines &amp; larger pores around my eyes, nose &amp; mouth so that my makeup just glided on this velvety smooth surface.</li>
            <li> It makes my face feels so soft and smooth and doesn&#x27;t make it feel oily at all.</li>
            <li> Somedays it works pretty well</li>
            <li> I received it really fast!</li>
            <li> IT HAS SUCH A SILKY SMOOTH COAT!</li>
            <li> I just wish it came in a larger tube (some of us just need more help than others).</li>
            <li> Makes your skin feel so smooth and young feeling.  </li>
            <li> I had a trial offer and decided to purchase and was sa great choice.. dont use everyday not to waste.. love it..</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a long time and love it.  </li>
            <li> Actually, the product is colorless, but it does exactly what it claims to do - smooth out and conceal pores before makeup application.  </li>
            <li> I consider this an essential make-up product that enhances any foundation and smooths over fine lines.</li>
            <li> I discovered this wonderful product years ago but was hesitate to buy it anywhere other than directly from DHC for fear that it would be less a quality than otherwise.  </li>
            <li> Makes my makeup seem extra smooth.</li>
            <li> I received it really fast.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product at my wife&#x27;s request (She doesn&#x27;t like to use the internet much).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s velvety smooth on my skin &amp; helps my makeup last longer.</li>
            <li> It did not clog my pores and was very helpful in avoiding getting my makeup into some acne scars which has always been a problem.  </li>
            <li> but dont get much in the tube.</li>
            <li> I apply after my moisturer and it really makes a difference in the look.</li>
            <li> I really really don&#x27;t know my feelings about this primer.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> If your not that old but would like to have your skin feel smooth and soft, you should try it.</li>
            <li> When it seems like the tube is empty, I cut the top off and find enough of the product for SEVERAL more applications.  </li>
            <li> It has a dry feel when you rub it between your fingers &amp; it spreads on your face so smoothly.</li>
            <li> but the fact she was older than I am without a sign of wrinkles convinced to try it.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money and if you want a good primer, this product will definitely do the job.  </li>
            <li> It is clear and goes on instantly, making your face feel instantly smooth.</li>
            <li> This product really leaves your face feeing soft and looking</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchase a few more tubes.</li>
            <li> I would  highly recommend this product  to those who want their skin to feel like brand new...</li>
            <li> Feels good for a few minutes and then skin feels to dry.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin around my eyes and it appears to irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> (and I&#x27;m very old).</li>
            <li> The fine lines around my eyes seems less.  </li>
            <li> I used this once and was completely sold!</li>
            <li> I am normally a big cheapo especially when it comes to beauty products but this is worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to have received a sample of this product a while back.</li>
            <li> Feels so soft.  </li>
            <li> It makes my skin fell so soft and silky.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel so soft and softens out the wrinkles..</li>
            <li> and I need to use enough to cover my whole face and neck.</li>
            <li> Works nearly as well as Lancôme.  </li>
            <li> but I can not use it on daily bases because it clogs pores to much and makes me brake out.</li>
            <li> Makes your skin feel so soft.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin soft as a baby</li>
            <li> no one could believe I was that old.</li>
            <li> It made my skin feel so soft and silky while giving a matte finish.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe my skin can feel so soft.  </li>
            <li> Excellent base with or without makeup.</li>
            <li> I save the Lancôme for special occasions and use the Velvet Skin Coat everyday.  </li>
            <li> didnot make skin as smooth and velvety as sample did, not satisfied at all</li>
            <li> It really does work, even o my aging, dry furrowed looking face.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really do anything , feels dry going on, when makeup is put over</li>
            <li> it actually makes the skin feel soft and young again....</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t tried anything like this and just fell into this category of makeup, like me, it&#x27;s worth a little one-time purchase and you&#x27;ll probably stick with it.</li>
            <li> It looks sort of like a translucent white in the tube and goes on clear, so eliminate that color question since there are no choices anyway.  </li>
            <li> I recently had my old lady birthday party and</li>
            <li> You only need a tiny bit of this to go a long way....</li>
            <li> (My last tube has dried out after a normal amount of time</li>
            <li> While this is my favorite primer, you do have to be careful about applying only a very thin coat (may clog larger pores -  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t use a lot of it, just a pinch, so the tube is destined to last a long time.</li>
            <li> Enclosed in its normal packaging and not at all dried out.  </li>
            <li> I will buy Velvet Sin coat for as long as they make it</li>
            <li> I usually use a small amount and apply to a specific area, (i.e.those well earned laugh line area around my eyes and underneath, also to my forehead -</li>
            <li> I have used it for a long time and wouldn&#x27;t be without it.</li>
            <li> so I knew the results of keeping it too long)  </li>
            <li> I looked for this for a long time!</li>
            <li> Been using this for a very long time.</li>
            <li> it looks flaky and dry</li>
            <li> I received a  sample a long time ago, but lost the empty packet so i couldn&#x27;t remember the name.</li>
            <li> Half my face with the old product and half with this one.</li>
            <li> It does the same thing as Smashbox for probably $20 less.</li>
            <li> I would only put on a little powder to hide the shine before I got this.</li>
            <li> I use it sparingly because it is expensive, but worth it.  </li>
            <li> So, the other reviews said you only need a little bit.</li>
            <li> I may have been sent an old tube, but it was dry and not nearly as good as the tube I had bought before.</li>
            <li> (though a little goes a long way, per application.)</li>
            <li> I do small areas at a time -- around the chin and mouth, then nose and cheeks, and last the forhead</li>
            <li> and It takes such a small amount.</li>
            <li> I always tried it but was never really interested in purchasing it until I discovered it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It provides such a smooth base for your makeup.</li>
            <li> It takes so very little to apply so the tube lasts a really long time.</li>
            <li> I just wish it cost less.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m convinced I used less foundation when using DHC.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that I did not receive a free sample as stated.  </li>
            <li> one complaint is that it is a small tube, wish it would come in a larger amount.</li>
            <li> Swish a little under your eyes, and wherever your wrinkles are and you&#x27;re done, then proceed with the rest of your make up routine.</li>
            <li> but foundations look heavy on my skin these days.</li>
            <li> I use this on my skin everyday.</li>
            <li> does what it says it will.....covers small lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Not sure where she heard about it.&lt;br /&gt;I asked her today for a review.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for the past six years.  </li>
            <li> Also too expensive for such a small amount</li>
            <li> I am not sure what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  </li>
            <li> Too small tube for the price</li>
            <li> Just ridiculous for the price.</li>
            <li> but it is a small tube and too expensive for me to keep buying it...</li>
            <li> I personally use it as a base for my concealer.</li>
            <li> It feels weird to try and skip</li>
            <li> /&gt;Based on her list of makeup, I bought Smashbox Photo Finish, a rather expensive product</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be sorry.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed.  </li>

            <li> Feels so soft.  The fine lines around my eyes seems less.  I love this product.</li>
            <li> I used this once and was completely sold! It feels like silk on my skin. I use it whether or not I am applying foundation because the smooth results are just incredible. DHC Velvet Skin Coat is a face primer; the smooth &amp;#34;canvas&amp;#34; it provides for foundation will surprise you! I consider this an essential make-up product that enhances any foundation and smooths over fine lines.</li>
            <li> Nice product; makes makeup go on smoothly and feels great on my face.</li>
            <li> Awesome product! Will defiently purchase again!</li>
            <li> I have used this product off and on for a number of years, but as I age I am returning to it more often. I need some facial coverage but foundations look heavy on my skin these days. This silicone cream puts a poreless, silky matte finish that is nicely topped with just powder.</li>
            <li> I love DHC Velvet Skin Coat!! It keeps my skin feeling clean and smooth all day as well as giving me great coverage all day.Been using this for a very long time.</li>
            <li> I have always loved DHC, especially this product. It makes my skin fell so soft and silky. I will buy Velvet Sin coat for as long as they make it</li>
            <li> The name describes it perfectly.  I use it sparingly because it is expensive, but worth it.  When it seems like the tube is empty, I cut the top off and find enough of the product for SEVERAL more applications.  I LOVE it!  I just wish it cost less.  By the way, the question about the color is not applicable.  It doesn&#x27;t come in shades.  It looks sort of like a translucent white in the tube and goes on clear, so eliminate that color question since there are no choices anyway.  It provides such a smooth base for your makeup.</li>
            <li> I love how this smoothes out and covers my skin.</li>
            <li> This is really good stuff.  I use it all of the time.  Makes my skin feel so smooth.</li>
            <li> This product really leaves your face feeing soft and looking healthy!&lt;br /&gt;It feels light and comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;This is my second order for this product and will continue to order.</li>
            <li> I love the way my skin looks and feels using this product.</li>
            <li> The very best makeup primer out there.  It can be used alone, but honestly if you want nice even coverage, this is a must use base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use sparingly on a clean face or after moisturizer. I usually use a small amount and apply to a specific area, (i.e.those well earned laugh line area around my eyes and underneath, also to my forehead - anywhere you think your make-up might not apply smoothly).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one complaint is that it is a small tube, wish it would come in a larger amount.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  I helps to prevent makeup from settling into wrinkles and creases giving a smoother appearance.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t &#x27;t believe the hype  from a friend but the fact she was older than I am without a sign of wrinkles convinced to try it.  It really does work, even o my aging, dry furrowed looking face.  Was a person who never used makeup because it always increased the appearance of any imperfection on  my face, DHC did just the opposite.</li>
            <li> does what it says it will.....covers small lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Smooth, silky preparation for make up.  Love it!</li>
            <li> (Has no color,) I LOVE it, a wonderful product, leaves skin silky smooth, will definitely be getting more.</li>
            <li> DHC Skin Coat is by far the best skin primer I have ever used! It leaves my skin so smooth and my make up just glides on smoothly.  I&#x27;m convinced I used less foundation when using DHC. Try it! I just wish it came in a larger tube (though a little goes a long way, per application.)</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel so soft and softens out the wrinkles.. Don&#x27;t have to wear make up either..</li>
            <li> Best primer to use for people who have large pores.  It fills them and provides a nice smooth surface for your make up to go on. I will always use  this primer!!  Thank you</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that I did not receive a free sample as stated.  Awesome product; unbelievable!!! Look forward to trying more.</li>
            <li> It did not cause me any irradiation. and I love the look and feel</li>
            <li> I have light skin and freckles.  The color of this product blended in perfectly and very smoothly.  It evens out your skin color and leaves it feeling very soft and smooth.  You can wear it as is or add blush or another powder over with a brush if you like.  You don&#x27;t have to use very much.  I do small areas at a time -- around the chin and mouth, then nose and cheeks, and last the forhead and then blend all over last.</li>
            <li> This product is the best I have ever used...it actually makes the skin feel soft and young again....I have been using this for over 10 years ..I would  highly recommend this product  to those who want their skin to feel like brand new...You only need a tiny bit of this to go a long way....So use it sparingly!</li>
            <li> Love this product! Makes my makeup stay in place &amp; makes my skin look great.</li>
            <li> I received it really fast. Very cheap. I love this primer for the skin, and I&#x27;m a older woman. Its like my pores just went away.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product at my wife&#x27;s request (She doesn&#x27;t like to use the internet much). Not sure where she heard about it.&lt;br /&gt;I asked her today for a review. She said, she loves the stuff. It is supposed to be an undercoat that you put makeup on top of.  She says, it&#x27;s perfect just by itself; it smooths out her skin and hides blotches. Looks good to me!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a long time and love it.  I wish that DHC would make it in a larger tube.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to have received a sample of this product a while back. When I tried it, I was amazed at the way it made my skin feel. Not only was my face incredibly silky, but it filled in all the little lines &amp; larger pores around my eyes, nose &amp; mouth so that my makeup just glided on this velvety smooth surface. It has a dry feel when you rub it between your fingers &amp; it spreads on your face so smoothly. And wow, my makeup looked so great &amp; it seemed as if I had a glow! It takes so very little to apply so the tube lasts a really long time. I never put makeup on without it! Amazing product!!</li>
            <li> I love the smooth velvety feel of my skin after using this product....and It takes such a small amount. I&#x27;ll continue to buy it.</li>
            <li> This product helps with making a smooth surface before you put on makeup. I have used it for a long time and wouldn&#x27;t be without it.</li>
            <li> Excellent! Makes me look younger every time I use it before I put on make up!</li>
            <li> I have used much better primers than this one. It comes in a tiny tube. Just ridiculous for the price. Well, I&#x27;m over 60 and I need to use enough to cover my whole face and neck. So, the other reviews said you only need a little bit. I did not find that to be the case. In my opinion, this is not for women over 50. I also did a comparison with a product I have been using. Half my face with the old product and half with this one. The old primer is 3 times better. My opinion, save your money.</li>
            <li> This product is fabulous and it certainly feels like velvet. I&#x27;ve purchase a few more tubes. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome!!! It makes my face feels so soft and smooth and doesn&#x27;t make it feel oily at all. I even put it on days I don&#x27;t wear makeup. I have oily skin and most days I would only put on a little powder to hide the shine before I got this. Now it has to be a special occasion for me to wear makeup because the Velvet Skin makes my face look so good.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  It just glides on and so does the makeup.</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to using this product with eye makeup. I have very sensitive skin around my eyes and it appears to irritate my skin. It is allergy season, so I can&#x27;t be sure this product is the whole cause of the irritation.</li>
            <li> This product lives up to it&#x27;s name. It&#x27;s velvety smooth on my skin &amp; helps my makeup last longer.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for the past six years.  Excellent base with or without makeup.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, as the title claims, it makes your skin feel very soft, as silk (not velvet!)  I tried another brand, which sells for over $40 and is supposed to be one of the very best, and this DHC primer has it beat by a mile! Don&#x27;t waste your money and if you want a good primer, this product will definitely do the job.  It did not clog my pores and was very helpful in avoiding getting my makeup into some acne scars which has always been a problem.  Will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed.  It didn&#x27;t meet the standard of the sample I received.&lt;br /&gt;Regrets.  I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff - everything I&#x27;ve tried is STICKY and this combats that - leaves my skin smooth and almost silky (and I&#x27;m very old).</li>
            <li> great primer but dont get much in the tube. its not stickey which i like</li>
            <li> Works nearly as well as Lancôme.  I save the Lancôme for special occasions and use the Velvet Skin Coat everyday.  It feels weird to try and skip it - makeup doesn&#x27;t go on nearly as smooth.</li>
            <li> I had purchased this from a catalog several years ago and liked it very much. Had not seen it for a while and then found it on Amazon. I may have been sent an old tube, but it was dry and not nearly as good as the tube I had bought before.</li>
            <li> This is good primer but I can not use it on daily bases because it clogs pores to much and makes me brake out.</li>
            <li> My skin feels great after I use this. I apply after my moisturer and it really makes a difference in the look.</li>
            <li> ITS WORKS WONDERFUL  I HAVE BEEN USING IT FOR 5 YEARS NOW AND COULD NOT APPLY MY MAKE UP WITHOUT IT</li>
            <li> I really really don&#x27;t know my feelings about this primer. Somedays it works pretty well but others, it is a total mess!&lt;br /&gt;When it works well, my face stays nice just for 4 or 5 hours and when it doesn&#x27;t, is a matter of 1 hour or even 30 minutes and the oil of my face starts to be visible. I think that i will try another primer because this is not what I look for.</li>
            <li> The best makeup primer I&#x27;ve used!  I&#x27;m done experimenting with any others!</li>
            <li> Makes your skin feel so soft. Found a tester in a magazine and loved it, so I found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> While this is my favorite primer, you do have to be careful about applying only a very thin coat (may clog larger pores -  you should use an exfoliating mask weekly to avoid this.)</li>
            <li> Feels good for a few minutes and then skin feels to dry. Also too expensive for such a small amount</li>
            <li> This is a skin smooooother . . . the only product I&#x27;ve ever used that lets my skin &amp;#34;take&amp;#34; makeup around the eyes without looking cakey.  It goes on like velvet, clear (no color) and so smooth, providing the best foundation for corrective cream, concealer and eye makeup and it stays that way all through the day.  Can&#x27;t ask for better than &amp;#34;perfect.&amp;#34;  For me, it&#x27;s well worth the money . . .</li>
            <li> This is one of the best Primers i have used. It makes my skin feel silky and smooth. I love it!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.  It makes putting on concealer and eye make-up easuer.</li>
            <li> I love it and will reorder</li>
            <li> I am normally a big cheapo especially when it comes to beauty products but this is worth every penny! It makes my skin soft as a baby and my makeup goes on even and flawless.</li>
            <li> After watching the amazing Cassandra Bankson video on Youtube (makeup she uses for cystic acne), I discovered there was something called Photo Finish Foundation Primer, which you put on under your foundation and it supposedly fills in the wrinkles, creating a &#x27;perfect palette&#x27; for makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on her list of makeup, I bought Smashbox Photo Finish, a rather expensive product but I was admittedly in love with the name \\&quot;Smashbox.\\&quot; I love the Smashbox Photo Finish product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For several years, though, I had been getting the DHC magazine and they always had a Velvet Coat sample attached to the magazine. I always tried it but was never really interested in purchasing it until I discovered it on Amazon. It does the same thing as Smashbox for probably $20 less. You don&#x27;t use a lot of it, just a pinch, so the tube is destined to last a long time. Swish a little under your eyes, and wherever your wrinkles are and you&#x27;re done, then proceed with the rest of your make up routine. It is clear and goes on instantly, making your face feel instantly smooth. If you haven&#x27;t tried anything like this and just fell into this category of makeup, like me, it&#x27;s worth a little one-time purchase and you&#x27;ll probably stick with it. Or it&#x27;s worth a read on what this makeup is.</li>
            <li> Pores be gone with this magic cream! I used it before foundation and its wonderful! I doesnt clog my pores either. Love it! will keep using it</li>
            <li> This makes your skin feel like velvet and make-up is optional after you put it on.  I love it a lot.</li>
            <li> I looked for this for a long time! I received a  sample a long time ago, but lost the empty packet so i couldn&#x27;t remember the name. I received another a quick ordered it. I received it really fast! Thanks</li>
            <li> I received a sample in the mail and came searching for this product.  It hides fine lines around my mouth, under eyes and erases pores.  Love Love Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I received a sample from  another company i love it . it leaves you face very smooth not shiny. its worth the amount and great for Christmas gift for anyone who loves make up or dabbles with it</li>
            <li> Make-up goes on so smooth over this. Now my 16-year-old daughter loves it as well.</li>
            <li> Love love this primer it&#x27;s the best ever must buy makeup looks great .</li>
            <li> Fantastic under makeup.</li>
            <li> TRULY ENJOY THIS PRODUCT. IT HAS SUCH A SILKY SMOOTH COAT! HAD TO BUY MORE!!!</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite skin care products; it makes my skin feel softer. I do not like the feel of make up - I use this instead.</li>
            <li> Works great on skin. Makes makeup look really good and  skin feel very soft. I use this on my skin everyday.</li>
            <li> used for 20 years or more.......</li>
            <li> An excellent primer for make-up. Smoothes and evens out color of skin.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff, but not much in the tube. I have aging skin and it makes your skin feel like velvet (therefore the name I guess). When you apply it before applying your makeup it makes you skin look so much better, the wrinkles virtually disappear. I recently had my old lady birthday party and no one could believe I was that old. I&#x27;m telling you this is one thing I would not want to be without. I just wish it came in a larger tube (some of us just need more help than others). That being said, it&#x27;s still worth it, and I don&#x27;t feel that way about a lot of cosmetics. If your not that old but would like to have your skin feel smooth and soft, you should try it. I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be sorry.</li>
            <li> didnot make skin as smooth and velvety as sample did, not satisfied at all</li>
            <li> I love this product. It made my skin feel so soft and silky while giving a matte finish. I would turned my husband on to this product and he likes the way it makes his skin feel while reducing shine</li>
            <li> I love this product and use it all the time.  Makes your skin feel so smooth and young feeling.  The pricing was also excellent.</li>
            <li> love this product..wouldnt be without it!</li>
            <li> Actually, the product is colorless, but it does exactly what it claims to do - smooth out and conceal pores before makeup application.  Great product!</li>
            <li> This product is great. There isn&#x27;t very much in the tube but you don&#x27;t need very much to cover your face. It goes on smooth as silk and feels light as air. It is a great base for foundation. I personally use it as a base for my concealer.</li>
            <li> I love it but it is a small tube and too expensive for me to keep buying it...</li>
            <li> I could definitely tell a difference.  No heaviness, so light you don&#x27;t notice it&#x27;s on.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really do anything , feels dry going on, when makeup is put over it looks flaky and dry</li>
            <li> I can not say enough about his product.  I love the way it makes my skin feel and look.  It smooths out my makeup and makes my face look flawless!</li>
            <li> This makes makeup glide on easily and without caking. I purchased this after using the sample in a magazine. I love this product!</li>
            <li> Love this primer on my eyelids. Eye makeup lasts all day and doesn&#x27;t smear</li>
            <li> I had a trial offer and decided to purchase and was sa great choice.. dont use everyday not to waste.. love it..</li>
            <li> This is the best primer I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> I discovered this wonderful product years ago but was hesitate to buy it anywhere other than directly from DHC for fear that it would be less a quality than otherwise.  I took a chance and saved a bit of cash in the process.  I must admit,  the Velvet Skin Coat arrived perfect!  Enclosed in its normal packaging and not at all dried out.  (My last tube has dried out after a normal amount of time so I knew the results of keeping it too long)  This is a wonderful product.  I do not wear foundation,  never have and hopefully never will but THIS is not foundation. . . it is much better.  Transparent so no worries of a color match.  This will allow you to apply any and all make-up with ease and make your skin feel like silk.  I love it.</li>
            <li> if you havent tried it you owe it to yourself to buy it. There is nothing else like. I love it and so do all my daughters.</li>
            <li> I am not sure what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  I thought it was supposed to give skin a glow and all it does is feel link of like a shear wax.????????</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe my skin can feel so soft.  I truly enjoy this product and will continue to use it.  My friends have been impressed, also, and intend to try it.</li>
            <li> Perfect product, love it</li>
            <li> This brand is my favorite in a skin primer for the face.</li>
            <li> Love this product, arrived so quickly!</li>
            <li> Smooth and silky on face. Too small tube for the price</li>
