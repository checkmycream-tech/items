            <li>received a free bottle of this for review .</li>
            <li>I like the fact it&#x27;s good for sensitive skin</li>
            <li>So far so good i have been using this product about a week now.....</li>
            <li>Overall lotion smelled fine and went on good.</li>
            <li>I feel more confident wearing shorter dresses and shorter skirts these days because I am not as self conscious about my body.</li>
            <li>Great for loose skin</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know if it helps yet, too early to tell, but it is a nice body cream.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed tighter skin and stretch marks fading, love this cream and will definitely be getting more.</li>
            <li>Amazing to find a product that actually works as advertised.</li>
            <li>but it is worth it.</li>
            <li>The price is worth it</li>
            <li>A bit pricey but well worth the money  </li>
            <li>I had been using different kind of cellulite creams from plastic surgeons and dermatology offices, which cost over $100 for 4oz.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny of what I paid for.</li>
            <li>Definitely will buy more.</li>
            <li>but it is first impression of the product.</li>
            <li>Pack it better next time.</li>
            <li>marks!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m definitely going to by more as soon as I run out.</li>
            <li>This is my first time using a cellulite cream.</li>
            <li>I can attest to that because after I lost all the weight I wanted to lose, I still have spots on my body that is plagued with cellulite - my thighs, to be more specific.</li>
            <li>I purchase more later on .</li>
            <li>This is my first time ever posting anything on amazon.</li>
            <li>Plus it really hasn&#x27;t done anything for my dimply skin</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping from the seller.</li>
            <li>This product really does make a difference.</li>
            <li>I was following recommendations of different health and woman&#x27;s magazines and different TV shows and was looking for ingredients such as Caffeine, Theophylline, Escin, Retinol that are considered to be best on the market to fight</li>
            <li>It is really work .</li>
            <li>cant wait to see the results after using a whole month......</li>
            <li>and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if this thing works or not, but I love how quick shipping was.  </li>
            <li>Religious use of UNT&#x27;s Slim Serenity Cellulite Cream has significantly helped with my cellulite.</li>
            <li>I could see that my stomach skin is more toned, less squishy and doesn&#x27;t have that bloated look.</li>
            <li>It might not do too much for cellulite, but it does leaves very soft skin.</li>
            <li>I started using this cellulite cream along with doing massage to my thighs where the cellulite just loves to live.</li>
            <li>So many women have problems with cellulite and no easy way to get rid of it, but I think I finally found a product that really works!</li>
            <li>Great for sensitive skin!&lt;br /&gt;I am always skeptical when using new products because of my very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>You can still clearly see the dimples but its improving.</li>
            <li>noticed considerable difference after about 10 days of using this cream twice a day.</li>
            <li>and you need to really use the cream on a regular basis.</li>
            <li>I say that if you are insecure about how you see yourself...then you work hard, eat right, live healthy and use products that would benefit you and boost your confidence!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes.</li>
            <li>This product really works and due to me having 2 c sections</li>

            <li> It has a thick consistency, doesn&#x27;t smell or burn, it soaks right into your skin.</li>
            <li> The pump is a little hard to use plus I&#x27;m nearly done and I&#x27;m not sure that there isn&#x27;t more in the bottle.  </li>
            <li> recently started this cream for loose skin around my stomach</li>
            <li> I have been complaining about cellulite for a long time so my friend suggested I buy this cream.</li>
            <li> After trying 3or4 other products with no results i decided to try this&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I want to try it on other areas too</li>
            <li> I saw Slim Serenity Cellulite cream on Amazon, I checked the list of ingredients first and noticed that it has all the ingredients of these fancy expensive</li>
            <li> For the price, I would expect it to last at least a month.</li>
            <li> Found the cream too thick to spread, but at the same time, saw no difference.</li>
            <li> plus I have lost a few pounds</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money it doesn&#x27;t work 😞</li>
            <li> I was once a fatty, lost it all</li>
            <li> but there were a few areas that I needed to work on the remaining fat/sagging skin.</li>
            <li> Was a little doubtful at first.  </li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t like using any products for beautification</li>
            <li> Not overwhelming difference</li>
            <li> Since I started using this cream I have noticed that not only are my cottage cheese thighs not as cheesy, but the skin is firming up as well.</li>
            <li> Not sure.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I may be a product reviewer but my thoughts are real and none of the things I say on my reviews are made up or fake - they are all based on my experience/s with whatever product I am reviewing.</li>
            <li> My upper arms were the WORST, I can handle the other areas, and I&#x27;ll need surgery for &amp;#34;the girls&amp;#34;, so I bought this cream specifically for the upper arms and nowhere else.</li>
            <li> that I tell anyone reading this that I eat a strict diet and work out regularly, so you can&#x27;t maintain bad habits and use this, you&#x27;ll be wasting your time and money.</li>
            <li> But after a few weeks!!!  </li>
            <li> I felt like I needed to do something before it gets any worse.</li>
            <li> but my stupidity keeps telling me to keep trying and wasting money until I find one.</li>
            <li> but I’ve noticed some cellulite on my legs lately and while it wasn’t horrible</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Amazing! Talking about amazing results in just week! Just on time for my vacation to Miami. My skin looks better and toner. My husband even noticed it and asked if I was exercising for our trip.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t like using any products for beautification but I’ve noticed some cellulite on my legs lately and while it wasn’t horrible I felt like I needed to do something before it gets any worse. My friend recommended this cream since she is using it and loves it. After using this every morning and evening for a couple weeks my thighs and even my butt have been looking firmer and smoother. Every day the skin looks better and better. I almost can’t wait for bathing suit season to roll around now!</li>
            <li> Great for loose skin&lt;br /&gt;I recently started this cream for loose skin around my stomach and I&#x27;m already noticing  visible results. I could see that my stomach skin is more toned, less squishy and doesn&#x27;t have that bloated look. I&#x27;m very impressed.</li>
            <li> I have been complaining about cellulite for a long time so my friend suggested I buy this cream. Even though I have not been perfect about using it twice a day I m already seeing some improvement. I m hooked!!! Definitely will buy more.</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time but package was damaged. Label on the bottle was scratched. I understand that it is not sellers fault but it is first impression of the product. Has to say that cream works. My wife likes it. And I see the difference. Not overwhelming difference but definitely there are noticeable results. So my grade is 3 stars. Pack it better next time.</li>
            <li> The pump is a little hard to use plus I&#x27;m nearly done and I&#x27;m not sure that there isn&#x27;t more in the bottle.  Plus it really hasn&#x27;t done anything for my dimply skin so I will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> So many women have problems with cellulite and no easy way to get rid of it, but I think I finally found a product that really works! I started using this cellulite cream along with doing massage to my thighs where the cellulite just loves to live. Since I started using this cream I have noticed that not only are my cottage cheese thighs not as cheesy, but the skin is firming up as well. I am very happy with results and will continue using this product.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  I am exercising plus I have lost a few pounds so all combined is very good.</li>
            <li> This cream helps with the tightening of sagging skin after I had my baby. I know it takes time but it is worth it. I m starting to exercise too and I hope both will help me to get my figure back</li>
            <li> It might not do too much for cellulite, but it does leaves very soft skin.</li>
            <li> I say go for it!&lt;br /&gt;I noticed considerable difference after about 10 days of using this cream twice a day. I say go for it! However, once you stop using it I think cellulite will come back. So you must change your lifestyle as in eating healthy, working out and you need to really use the cream on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> After trying 3or4 other products with no results i decided to try this&lt;br /&gt;I have a severe case of cellulite and im starting to see the results  my legs look smoother. You can still clearly see the dimples but its improving. I cant wait to see the results in 3 months i have only been using this product for 2 weeks</li>
            <li> The Slim Cellulite Cream by UNT Inc. is a great slimming and tightening product. It really help firm up my stomach after I lost 20 lbs. and had extra skin n flab on my stomach. I applied 2 times a day and in 2 weeks I could tell a difference. I like the fact it&#x27;s good for sensitive skin so you can apply morning and night. If your looking for a slimming or tighten cream that won&#x27;t break your budget this is the one.</li>
            <li> Overall lotion smelled fine and went on good. However, I saw no change, and the bottle only lasted me 2 weeks. For the price, I would expect it to last at least a month. I used it morning and night.</li>
            <li> Ive been apply as directed, no difference at all.</li>
            <li> Found the cream too thick to spread, but at the same time, saw no difference. Maybe if I used it for a couple of months or something, it may show improvement. Not sure.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! Trust me it works wonders. Not just on cellulite but on saggy skin and also my stretch marks!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m definitely going to by more as soon as I run out.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money it doesn&#x27;t work 😞</li>
            <li> This cream works! I&#x27;ve used the Clarin Brand cellulite cream and it has the same effect for a lower price. Fast shipping from the seller.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this thing works or not, but I love how quick shipping was.  I will post something after two weeks. I&#x27;m going to combine it with exercise and healthy diet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a cellulite cream that ever worked but my stupidity keeps telling me to keep trying and wasting money until I find one. So here it goes, and I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m saying this, but... THIS STUFF WORKS.  It has a thick consistency, doesn&#x27;t smell or burn, it soaks right into your skin. I was once a fatty, lost it all but there were a few areas that I needed to work on the remaining fat/sagging skin. My upper arms were the WORST, I can handle the other areas, and I&#x27;ll need surgery for &amp;#34;the girls&amp;#34;, so I bought this cream specifically for the upper arms and nowhere else. Twice a day, no exceptions, even if I forgot and get back up out of bed, I&#x27;ll do it. I&#x27;ve noticed tighter skin and stretch marks fading, love this cream and will definitely be getting more. The price is worth it and I want to try it on other areas too, I see no reason why it wouldn&#x27;t work anywhere else. My only regret is that I didn&#x27;t take before pictures, I would&#x27;ve posted them but I honestly didn&#x27;t think this stuff would do anything.&lt;br /&gt;**Important that I tell anyone reading this that I eat a strict diet and work out regularly, so you can&#x27;t maintain bad habits and use this, you&#x27;ll be wasting your time and money.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see any change 💔</li>
            <li> The cream seems ok. This is my first time using a cellulite cream.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know if it helps yet, too early to tell, but it is a nice body cream.</li>
            <li> I am really happy that I bought this product and it&#x27;s such good value for money!</li>
            <li> I have only been using this for a week or so and I would definitely recommend to anyone who has a problem with cellulite. I can already see a big difference in the back of my thighs. Amazing to find a product that actually works as advertised. I will be ordering again!</li>
            <li> Weight loss is a good thing - specially if your weight is an obstacle keeping you from living a full and healthy life. In most instances, weight gain goes hand in hand with cellulite and not everyone can get rid of it with weight loss and exercise. I can attest to that because after I lost all the weight I wanted to lose, I still have spots on my body that is plagued with cellulite - my thighs, to be more specific. Religious use of UNT&#x27;s Slim Serenity Cellulite Cream has significantly helped with my cellulite. As directed, I use it twice a day - after working out and hitting the shower in the mornings and before I go to bed. I feel more confident wearing shorter dresses and shorter skirts these days because I am not as self conscious about my body. They always say that we have to be embrace the body that we are blessed with. I say that if you are insecure about how you see yourself...then you work hard, eat right, live healthy and use products that would benefit you and boost your confidence!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for others. I refuse to review or endorse products that I have not or will not personally try. Needless to say, I may be a product reviewer but my thoughts are real and none of the things I say on my reviews are made up or fake - they are all based on my experience/s with whatever product I am reviewing. I’m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying. My views and opinions are from a customer/end user’s standpoint.</li>
            <li> This product really does make a difference. A bit pricey but well worth the money  Thank You,</li>
            <li> I had been using different kind of cellulite creams from plastic surgeons and dermatology offices, which cost over $100 for 4oz.  I was following recommendations of different health and woman&#x27;s magazines and different TV shows and was looking for ingredients such as Caffeine, Theophylline, Escin, Retinol that are considered to be best on the market to fight cellulite.&lt;br /&gt;When I saw Slim Serenity Cellulite cream on Amazon, I checked the list of ingredients first and noticed that it has all the ingredients of these fancy expensive creams.&lt;br /&gt;I had to try it&lt;br /&gt;Love the product!&lt;br /&gt;I use it twice a day, morning after shower and then before going to bed.&lt;br /&gt;I am actually noticing some improvement.&lt;br /&gt;I also like that it is fragrance free, so I can use it in the morning and not to worry that it will interfere with the smell of my perfume.</li>
            <li> I try so many kinds already but this one is incredible. I try it within 3 days I found the result . It is really work . I purchase more later on .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad that I tried it!  I have been using this cream and I do feel it tightens my skin and helps with my cellulite.&lt;br /&gt;They are a great company and their customer service was outstanding. I finally feel like a company cares about their customer with them. Buy it you won&#x27;t regret it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free bottle of this for review .</li>
            <li> I want to say THANK YOU to the creators of this product. I&#x27;ve been using this for a month now along with working out and my tummy is starting to lose inches. This is my first time ever posting anything on amazon. This product really works and due to me having 2 c sections this cream is making me have more confidence within myself. It&#x27;s worth every penny of what I paid for.</li>
            <li> So far so good i have been using this product about a week now.....i love that its not greasy it absorbs very easy and i have noticed that it is firming my skin already....cant wait to see the results after using a whole month......</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive skin!&lt;br /&gt;I am always skeptical when using new products because of my very sensitive skin.  I have been using slim serenity for 2 weeks now, twice daily. I&#x27;ve never had any problems with this cream.&lt;br /&gt;Received the package next day. Very satisfied with product!&lt;br /&gt;Thank You!</li>
            <li> Was a little doubtful at first.  But after a few weeks!!!  What a difference!!!  This product is really great.  I will definitely reorder before i let myself run out</li>
