            <li>I had already had a great experience with one of their products, so I hoped I would be equally happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li>It is definitely a great product, I have been using henna for years</li>

            <li>I am so happy that I did my research.  </li>

            <li>, you&#x27;re welcome to try leaving it in for longer.</li>
            <li>Just ordered and can&#x27;t comment on the quality, I have been using another brand of henna that works great and thought I&#x27;d see if this one could make my hair even redder...</li>
            <li>I gave 5 stars because their customer service is as great as their product.</li>
            <li>My daughters hair looks great with it in.  </li>
            <li>but in all it is a great product</li>
            <li>Great Product.</li>

            <li>This product  works great on light hair!  :D</li>

            <li>And the results were amazing!</li>
            <li>and it looks amazing!</li>
            <li>The color is wonderful, and my hair is in beautifully healthy condition with no split ends whatsoever.</li>

            <li>It is a lovely auburn color after a week or two and I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li>seller shipped the dye very quickly and provided excellent instructions, as well as a hair cap and gloves!</li>
            <li>Amazing color and great quality</li>
            <li>My hands were bright orange, but my hair appeared unchanged.  </li>
            <li>On the bright side-</li>
            <li>While it didnt really do a good job coloring my hair, probulary</li>
            <li>I loved it and have been using it ever since.</li>
            <li>I loved it.  </li>
            <li>I bought 3 packets and got 1 free, best deal online!</li>
            <li>is a good product.</li>
            <li>are always stopping me and asking me what i use to get my hair so gorgeous.</li>
            <li>Gorgeous color,</li>
            <li>but I loved how my hair came out...</li>
            <li>Good Evening.</li>
            <li>This brand and color is just as good and WAY cheaper.</li>
            <li>Just give me the good stuff from Sally&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I found some really good advice.  </li>
            <li>also, applying vaseline to your hairline, neck, and ears is a really good trick to keep it from staining there.  </li>
            <li>the color is good</li>
            <li>The color looks good.</li>
            <li>and I have to say I absolutely loved this product and the way it turned out on chemically colored hair.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t even get me started on how magnificent it looks when the sunlight is hitting it at the right angle!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t even get me started on how magnificent it looks when the sunlight is hitting it at the right angle!</li>
            <li>so I decided to to purchase; it is a great quality Henna and the color true to picture!!  </li>
            <li>The paste is very smooth and is of great quality.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t found a hairdresser to make me happy yet, to top it of i am SEVERELY allergic to chemical hair dyes.</li>
            <li>great colour, always comes out healthy.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with the purchase of this Henna.</li>
            <li>Loved the color but every time it would rain- or after a nice swim- my clothes would be stained.</li>
            <li>I was impressed that this henna doesn&#x27;t require time to sit (you just mix and put it right on).</li>
            <li>The red is so brilliant and awesome.</li>
            <li>After using this, I would say that this is a good product, but you have to take the right steps!!!</li>
            <li>My favorite henna on the market!</li>
            <li>I am in love!</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t ask for anything better!</li>
            <li>And i love the result!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I was a bit apprehensive about how it would turn out; but I&#x27;m so glad I tried it out!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve already gotten many complements on my hair!</li>
            <li>I must say, I love it!  </li>
            <li>Love you Henna Guys!</li>
            <li>Many users suggest using teas to scent the water, and for that I thank them!</li>
            <li>I love this product!  </li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>and I get so many compliments!</li>
            <li>Love the hair dye!  </li>
            <li>I love henna!</li>
            <li>and I love getting my henna from The Henna Guys!</li>
            <li>I AM IN LOVE!</li>
            <li>but I love the color!</li>
            <li>The color is beautiful, a perfect red, giving my espresso hair a cherry cola color.</li>
            <li>the color is amazing.</li>
            <li>My hair isn&#x27;t shiny, it isn&#x27;t softer than it was before I started, it doesn&#x27;t look amazing or anything.</li>
            <li>The results are amazing.</li>
            <li>If you have never dyed with henna before, go to hennaforhair.com, it&#x27;s an amazing site with all kinds of tips and instructions.</li>
            <li>My hair smelled and felt muddy for like 3 days, but honestly...</li>
            <li>I thought it would be a good deal since you get more of it</li>
            <li>This is absolutely the best henna I have ever found!  </li>
            <li>For those complaining about how this runs for many shampoos afterward, well, that is just the price you pay with henna for good coverage that gets the roots.</li>
            <li>I quite literally detest this dye and never will do my own hair again.</li>
            <li>How do you explain yellow/orange marks on all of a nice hotels linens.</li>
            <li>I really liked it...</li>
            <li>It was still warm to the touch.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I also noticed that my hair has a nice &amp;#34;deep red&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I just mix with warm water as directed.  </li>
            <li>so thats nice.</li>
            <li>actually kind of hope it lightens up some.</li>
            <li>Perhaps I could have thinned it out some more, but it didn&#x27;t seem like a good idea.</li>
            <li>(Then he tells me he liked it the way it was.</li>
            <li>I decided to try the Henna Guys out on a whim and ended up LOVING IT.</li>
            <li>The color is bright and beautiful exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>great sellers with great high quality henna!</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s my honest feedback:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The color is beautiful, the product is smooth and easy to use, but it bleeds and bleeds and bleeds!</li>
            <li>However, I recieved the product very very quickly, and it was amazing!</li>
            <li>/&gt;To be fair, it did leave my hair feeling better once I applied conditioner on top of the henna and</li>
            <li>/&gt;To be fair, it did leave my hair feeling better once I applied conditioner on top of the henna and</li>
            <li>I love the results and I will be for sure ordering again!</li>
            <li>The best I can describe the color is a beautiful black cherry.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m used to using straight up BAQ henna to dye my hair, which produces a very bright, orangey color (think of Lucille Ball).  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I searched the web and ended up buying what is probably the most popular brand in the US.</li>
            <li>but so far this is the best I found.</li>
            <li>After years of dying my hair and spending hundreds of dollars on professional color, I  am so happy to have found this!</li>
            <li>The color is intense and beautiful.  </li>
            <li>It has a very smooth consistency no clumps or anything.</li>
            <li>This is a beautiful bright red!</li>
            <li>The texture of the mixture is nice and fine.</li>
            <li>My hair looks better every time I use</li>
            <li>Tip: the longer you leave it in your hair the better the results.</li>
            <li>i love it.</li>
            <li>but it sure did restore it.</li>
            <li>I love this henna, I&#x27;ve tried the Rainbow brand henna before</li>
            <li>This is more cherry.</li>
            <li>Then I lifted my head, piled my hair on the top of my head, and kept massaging the mix onto my head until I used all the of the mix.</li>
            <li>, I have dyed my hair so many times since I was 14.</li>
            <li>and I sincerely regret allowing this to touch my hair.</li>
            <li>Will keep using this henna :)</li>
            <li>I will be able to dye my hair twice from one packet.</li>
            <li>, It cover all my grays and I love the results.</li>
            <li>I just love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this product and will look forward to buying more...</li>
            <li>I love it.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li>Every time I touched my hair, more orange stains.</li>
            <li>that being said, I still love the color in my hair.</li>
            <li>As in I need to use way more of this powder to get the job done, because it&#x27;s not all henna.</li>
            <li>I love using the Henna hair dye so much more than store bought dye</li>
            <li>and it smells like nature :).</li>
            <li>love it best red color henna ive used.</li>
            <li>I love, love, love, this brand.  </li>
            <li>The customer service is also top notch.  </li>
            <li>They will answer any questions with a great attitude and very promptly.</li>
            <li>and I LOVE  it.</li>
            <li>I just did it again 2 days ago as a matter of fact :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so pleased.</li>
            <li>I love this nashville all had dye</li>
            <li>I have been using this product now for about 8 months and my hair has never looked or felt better.</li>
            <li>seems help it penetrate my kinky resistant hair better</li>
            <li>Not even being able to brush your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>why am so glad I found this!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Getting complements &amp; love how soft/strong/thick my hair feels(use</li>
            <li>I love this stuff</li>
            <li>I am SO glad that I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love both colors,  </li>
            <li>Applying to your hair is more of a process because it is like a mud mask that you are putting on your hair.  </li>
            <li>I have gotten henna on tile, counter top, my hands, and I have not had an issue with staining.</li>
            <li>It worked so much better than my hair dye.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s okay to do that with henna since it doesn&#x27;t hurt your hair.  </li>
            <li>at the point now where I think all the dyed hair has been trimmed off and it looks so much better with the henna.  </li>
            <li>does a better job of sticking to my hair, and skin than it does the counters.&lt;br</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m allergic to scented soaps, metals, and most cosmetic makeups for those looking for specifics.)&lt;br /&gt;»Buying it in bulk</li>
            <li>When you go to wash it out, it should take maybe two minutes at most.</li>
            <li>I love the product a lot.</li>
            <li>, if you&#x27;re looking for bright shiny red hair, this is a great product.</li>
            <li>When I applied it I thought i might have problems because I had 1-2 inches gown out and ends that had been colored many times.  </li>
            <li>The color turned out lovely.</li>
            <li>I bought this product and at first the color turned out AMAZING!  </li>
            <li>be sure to wear gloves also, this stuff stains IMMEDIATELY.  </li>
            <li>next, we wrapped my head in plastic wrap (the cling type works best) and put on a shower cap, and went to watch a movie.  </li>
            <li>here&#x27;s the link to the tutorial i found most helpful:</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>i love my results</li>
            <li>but i am now love it</li>
            <li>So, I decided to try this stuff, to see if it was any better.</li>
            <li>wait 1-2 days to shampoo my hair after Henna, to make sure I don&#x27;t cause loss of color before it&#x27;s fully set.</li>
            <li>The color is absolutely stunning, no kidding.  </li>
            <li>I love these guys.</li>
            <li>I thought I have read most the reviews</li>
            <li>It could have worked better.</li>
            <li>I have used henna hair dye before and this is one of the better</li>
            <li>but I have to disagree with most of the reviewers on the smell level</li>
            <li>The more you dye your hair with henna, the darker the outcome color, and this was my case.</li>
            <li>Not nearly as red in the picture, but still very beautiful.</li>
            <li>I love love love this product.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t even need conditioner as my hair felt so healthy already.</li>
            <li>so I could get the best possible color.</li>
            <li>The final result was PERFECT.</li>
            <li>I totally love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This stuff is officially my favorite henna dye.</li>
            <li>I really like the color turned  out very nice.</li>
            <li>Perfect root coverage and deep, rich color!</li>
            <li>You may not be impressed at first right after your shower, and that&#x27;s absolutely fine.</li>
            <li>The color stays pretty bright for about a month.</li>
            <li>There is a bit of a learning curve with that, but there are some pretty good instructional videos on YouTube if you are worried about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair feels healthy and strong, unlike box dye which fries my ends.</li>
            <li>The customer service is more than helpful and responds very quickly.</li>
            <li>Amazing results &amp; fast shipping!!</li>
            <li>It also had great reviews on the lovely rosey red color, and I was even more eager to try that one.</li>
            <li>My color is great, my hair is just a soft as before if not softer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Nupur brand at $4 a a package with free shipping, so unless this brand is considerably better, I&#x27;ll stick with the $4 package of henna.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty experienced with using henna to dye my hair and i usually use Rainbow brand, which works wonderfully.</li>
            <li>Great if you are going all natural, though.</li>
            <li>I love that this stuff is organic and free of magnetic salts.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t remember much about the color, don&#x27;t think it did a good job.</li>
            <li>orange sweat doesn&#x27;t really  look good.</li>
            <li>The red is gorgeous!</li>
            <li>The color is definitely more red now, and my hair is still looking great.</li>
            <li>The color is definitely more red now, and my hair is still looking great.</li>
            <li>I thought it was really easy to apply and use</li>
            <li>The roots are definately bright but as the white hair grows out I can tell it will make nice highlights around my face.</li>
            <li>It comes off easily with water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It tangles easily.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply.</li>
            <li>I found the mixture really easy to apply.</li>
            <li>So vibrant and bright.</li>
            <li>The purple tones still come out, just not as strongly as before.</li>
            <li>The purple tones still come out, just not as strongly as before.</li>
            <li>It is amazing how consistently it applies all over the hair.</li>
            <li>I liked the color it gave my hair at first</li>
            <li>First off they ship FAST so great device for that.</li>
            <li>lavender, a smell I typically despise, did a wonderful job at distracting from it.&lt;br /&gt;»Does</li>
            <li>(i know some people say not to, but it was fine)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been about 3 weeks since my initial dye and my hair still looks awesome even with washing with hot water.</li>
            <li>I will buy from this seller again and am very excited to see how it would look on my new growing healthy hair!</li>
            <li>This henna goes on so smooth and not clumpy</li>
            <li>And yes, my mother used the gloves while applying (although the gloves supplied were cheap and broke on her, thus her getting orange stained hands for a couple of days) .</li>
            <li>My roommate helped me put it on my hair with a dye brush and things went smoothly.</li>
            <li>I was very worried it would stain my ears and face, but honestly it didn&#x27;t leave any stains.</li>
            <li>It just smells of hay lightly.</li>
            <li>How does that sound?</li>
            <li>They are as advertised,  metallic salt free.  </li>
            <li>I re-dyed a week later and it got darker orange lol</li>
            <li>It just doesn&#x27;t like light or moisture.</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s at my shoulders now) and attempt to still enjoy dying my hair.</li>
            <li>and I keep trying different brands because I hadn&#x27;t found one that I was really happy with.</li>
            <li>The color is absolutely fabulous.</li>
            <li>It is also really important to me that this is a chemical free product that conditions my hair rather than damaging it like tradition hair dyes.</li>
            <li>this stuff not only effectively stains hair...but everything you own.</li>
            <li>So the henna seems to be far superior.  </li>
            <li>but overall it&#x27;s a good product :)</li>
            <li>The girls at Lush loved my color.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I let the water run clear, then combed my hair out, washed again for good measure and my hair was still leaking orange all over the place.</li>
            <li>Word to the wise: if you&#x27;re going to use this product, put a towel or old pillowcase over your pillow before you go to sleep, because this WILL stain your pillowcases.&lt;br</li>
            <li>far as longevity, I didn&#x27;t wash my hair for 48 hours afterward and have washed it in warm water with color safe hair products once.</li>
            <li>Very red very rich and very easy!</li>
            <li>Absolutely Perfect and just what the previous reviews said!  </li>
            <li>Overall I love their henna!!</li>
            <li>The color is so vibrant, but still appropriate for most work situations.</li>
            <li>It was easy to apply and because of the smooth consistency I was able to color my whole head.</li>
            <li>nice vibrant color.  </li>
            <li>I used it for quite a while, but it seemed like my roots were showing more and more, until there were a good two inches of roots with little to no coverage, even after they would have received about three applications by then.</li>
            <li>While most of the semi-permanent dyes were vegetable based dyes, I still utilized quite a bit of the other chemical dyes as well as a good quantity of strong bleach.</li>
            <li>It makes the hair feel like you washed it with dirt for the first two days when you first get it out, but feels awesome after the next shampoo</li>
            <li>The end result was well worth the wait!  </li>
            <li>is significantly cheaper than purchasing chemical hair dye from the store, or online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Will update after I get my $28 worth of henna!</li>
            <li>It was a lot of fun to mix (like playing with mud!).</li>
            <li>My hair has never felt more healthy and soft!  </li>
            <li>I have gotten so many compliments, from the first day I had it in to a month + afterwards.</li>
            <li>so, i used some apple cider vinegar (make sure it is unfiltered with the mother, because otherwise it won&#x27;t have all the nutritional benefits) and some HOT water.  </li>
            <li>I love it so much that I have converted my sister and mother to using The Henna Guys too!</li>
            <li>It covered the grey great.</li>
            <li>but so worth it when its rinsed out and finished!</li>
            <li>The smell is fairly pleasant, much better than some other hennas I&#x27;ve tried and not at all objectionable.</li>
            <li>This honestly worked better than the hair dye I had just recently (about a month ago) applied to my hair.</li>
            <li>It was really worth it, easy to mix and somewhat a pain to apply.</li>
            <li>I suggest putting a mirror in your tub and doing it there for faster clean up.</li>
            <li>I was swayed by the overwhelming positive reviews for this product and decided to buy myself 100</li>
            <li>right now.&lt;br /&gt;The Henna product from this Amazon site was easy to apply and clean up.</li>
            <li>My hair came out with the most wonderful darker brown with some awesome red highlights which used to be my ugly grays.  </li>
            <li>I waited 4 weeks after my initial salon dye before applying the henna and had been washing my hair with warm/hot water to ensure the original dye faded a fair amount</li>
            <li>This Henna right here does everything it claims to do!  </li>
            <li>It has a lovely smooth and slippery texture that makes application a dream and is a sign of high quality henna.</li>
            <li>With this dye my scalp is clear, not flaky, and the color is amazing.  </li>
            <li>I love the color my hair turned out, this henna is good quality, I have dark brown  </li>
            <li>Perhaps it is the hibiscus that is running bright yellow in my shower and staining my towels</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as bright as the picture because I don&#x27;t have blonde hair</li>
            <li>I am equally convinced that the Henna Guys have managed to find and obtain a superior quality of henna that even discerning natives would scramble to get.</li>
            <li>I left it on just over 3 hours with 2 processing caps and a sock cap on then \\&quot;washed\\&quot; with a fair amount of V05 conditioner.</li>
            <li>Full disclosure: I did mix in around 2T of hibiscus powder before I realized it was already listed in the(2) ingredients.</li>
            <li>It has a good texture when mixed</li>
            <li>The smell was not bad at all - like the package says it smells like nature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The smell everyone complains about was not bad at all.</li>
            <li>It is very messy, but as you become more experienced with using henna, it gets easier.  </li>
            <li>I found it easy to apply and the color turned out lovely (pretty much like the pictures).</li>
            <li>and I really appreciated that I&#x27;ve found a way to feel pretty without a million chemicals I can&#x27;t pronounce!!!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll try to add some photos soon!a beautiful black cherry.</li>
            <li>, it makes my hair feel full of life and super shiny.</li>
            <li>First application was bright but beautiful, second darkened it to exactly the red auburn I was aiming for</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will probably switch back to a pure henna to try to stop the bleeding, but if my hair still bleeds I will happily upgrade my rating of this product.</li>
            <li>I thought I must be missing some steps, but it turned out gorgeous!</li>
            <li>other than that its great, i get a lot of compliments.</li>
            <li>And with the most lovely deep henna color ever!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Luckily it has not stained my towels.  </li>
            <li>but it fades really quickly.</li>
            <li>My hair now has a red wine \\&quot;glow\\&quot; to it and looks amazing in the light.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t even had chemical dyes look this bold before.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The package arrived quickly, included instructions and gloves.</li>
            <li>And I recommend if you&#x27;re pregnant or just dont want chemicals on your body.</li>
            <li>It got such good reviews and the price was right, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  </li>
            <li>I would say the color is very true, A beautiful Deep Red.</li>
            <li>I went with Henna because I read it dyed great over dark hair</li>
            <li>But overall I am very pleased with the way it made my hair look and feel.</li>
            <li>And it lasted a good long time.</li>
            <li>You have a new loyal customer. :-)</li>
            <li>It is a darker red than I normally use and at first I wasn&#x27;t sure I loved the color.</li>
            <li>, I love my new color.</li>
            <li>It came with very detailed instructions and was very simple and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I used this henna just a week after applying Lush&#x27;s Caca Rouge henna and I loved that it made my hair a very nice deep red.</li>
            <li>Even though my hair was so dark my hair turned a nice bright browny-red with super red highlights in the light.</li>
            <li>With this batch, my hair never bled at all after the first rinse, and my hands didn&#x27;t stain at all!</li>
            <li>THIS red is my favorite!</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy this again :) and again and again!</li>
            <li>Thanks for a great product especially for a first time henna user.</li>
            <li>I will definitely order more!  </li>
            <li>I am so in love with my new hair right now</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a beautiful, rich deep red &amp; my hair feels like heaven!!</li>
            <li>It is much more red than the other product I used (which gave my hair more of a natural gingery color) and fades beautifully over time.</li>
            <li>I even used a light brown towel during the whole dye process and that didn&#x27;t stain either.</li>
            <li>My hair feels soft, looks shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li>it was worth it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>I honestly can&#x27;t remember the last time someone had complimented my hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s 100% worth it for me.</li>
            <li>I honestly can&#x27;t remember the last time someone had complimented my hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s 100% worth it for me.</li>
            <li>The henna masked my Clairol dye wonderfully without darkening it too much and the red is definitely noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The henna masked my Clairol dye wonderfully without darkening it too much and the red is definitely noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>it does smell a bit like hay while applied but the color you acheive is worth the three or four hours of stinking</li>
            <li>Beautiful and true color, deep red.</li>
            <li>On top of that, my hair has never been more healthy, thick, shiny and amazing!Ppl</li>
            <li>I recommend buying your own since mine ripped almost immediately when I tried to cover my massive hair.</li>
            <li>The Henna Guys wins out hands down.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now the first time I used a whole pack, so if it is your first time using henna,  you may need more until you&#x27;re used to it.  </li>
            <li>the smell of this product and the 2-3 hour wait for the color may suck, but the results of the color is totally worth it...</li>
            <li>I can say, this is my favorite thus far.</li>
            <li>The color continues to fade and I sincerely hope that it fades out completely.  </li>
            <li>Beautiful vibrant color, minimal bleeding!</li>
            <li>I bought this with much anticipation and was hoping that my hair would turn a beautiful shade with red highlights and a nice sheen over my black hair</li>
            <li>On my medium brown hair, I got a rich, deep red, and I got a lot of really great compliments on it.  </li>
            <li>That night my fianc&amp;eacute; said \\&quot;when did you dye your hair bright red?\\&quot; This is the first time in my history with various henna products that anyone has ever noticed!&lt;br /&gt;Compared to many other hennas this was easy to use, just mix then apply.</li>
            <li>arrived far more quickly than I expected, and that made me thrilled before I even started.</li>
            <li>The shade stuck right away and shimmers in the sun.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll ruin towels too right after a washing your hair.</li>
            <li>When it was all melty and the right consistency, I covered it with a damp paper towel</li>
            <li>The henna takes about 2-3 days to fully oxidize, and even then you may not be completely impressed, it may seem too dark or not as RED as you wished.</li>
            <li>The henna takes about 2-3 days to fully oxidize, and even then you may not be completely impressed, it may seem too dark or not as RED as you wished.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although I remain impressed by the way it provided deep pigment over dark non-chemically treated African-American hair.</li>
            <li>My hair turned a beautiful deep red just as explained.</li>
            <li>I use warm water (not piping hot) and after an initial rinse in water I use conditioner to help get the rest out.</li>
            <li>Mixed together like pudding, very easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It took 12 hours to dye release, left a copper color and smelled VERY strongly of hay for WEEKS.</li>
            <li>But after one henna treatment my hair felt amazing, and I knew right away that I&#x27;d be using it for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i used a packet and a half, mixed in a metal bowl, and this worked perfectly.  </li>
            <li>I loved the color, but it is super messy.</li>
            <li>ok, so i&#x27;ve only dyed my hair a handful of times in my life, and i&#x27;ve never been terribly pleased with the results, and it always fades completely by 2-3 weeks.  </li>
            <li>Much more vibrant than I thought, but still fine for a regular look.  </li>
            <li>If pure henna bleeds, I will assume the problem is my hair!</li>
            <li>absolutely recommend this product to anyone who wishes for healthy, glossy, natural looking red-hued hair.</li>
            <li>absolutely recommend this product to anyone who wishes for healthy, glossy, natural looking red-hued hair.</li>
            <li>excellent color and hair is now thick and soft.</li>
            <li>The last time I colored my hair, I was looking for something that would give me a darker, deeper red color, but was still all-natural - and this seemed like a great choice.  </li>
            <li>For those looking for a natural red, this might be too bright.  </li>
            <li>One thing i noticed is you can barely notice any colour in photos, but in natural light it looks stunning.</li>
            <li>we were outside and instead of the sun showing a nice red henna tint it showed bright yellow.</li>
            <li>and it came very very fast</li>
            <li>my hair continued to bleed, but it was a very, very light yellow color and my scalp was beginning to hurt</li>
            <li>It seemed to have stopped a bit, but the running doesn&#x27;t seem to take away from the color very much.</li>
            <li>Very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>I was so excited about the initial results that I purchased a huge package of it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many red hennas on the market right now, Light Mountain, Henna Maiden, Lush....</li>
            <li>I guess I should mention though that it is in fact pure henna because it did not react with chemical dyes afterwards, so it is worth one star.</li>
            <li>and it seems positive I wil right a nother one tonight when finished.</li>
            <li>have used Henna in the past, but never had such great results as this!</li>
            <li>In fact, I was even happier than the first time.</li>
            <li>Was more of an earthy Brick Red.</li>
            <li>But my hair turned a deep burgundy color that I adore, became ridiculously healthy and fuller, and I got tons of compliments on the shine and color.</li>
            <li>I tried adding herbal tea and hibiscus to try to get some more color, but to the same results.</li>
            <li>The color has faded since I first did it.  </li>
            <li>This was my first experience with Henna.</li>
            <li>You will get a lovely deep garnet color.</li>
            <li>this is my first.</li>
            <li>Okay so first things first, I bought this product in Deep Red.&lt;br /&gt;Second</li>
            <li>dyed my roots a lovely red color, but the rest of my hair was unchanged.&lt;br /&gt;Let</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ruined so many white clothes and a number of pillows and pillow cases...</li>
            <li>It washes out in the laundry, but I panicked at first.</li>
            <li>pretty fishy.</li>
            <li>I can safely say that I will never go back to dyes with chemicals in it!</li>
            <li>This was my first time using henna.</li>
            <li>This is the first time that I used Henna on my hair.  </li>
            <li>color is always super vibrant, even a month after henna-ing.</li>
            <li>Thanks Henna Guys!</li>
            <li>but maybe I didn&#x27;t reach those ones with the mix,there&#x27;s also things you can add to help cover grays or make it more red/blk, there&#x27;s a lot of YouTube videos on Henna.&lt;br /&gt;color,Thining hair,Grays or if just healthier hair,I can&#x27;t say about(brand)being i&#x27;ve only tryd this1.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>luck ;)</li>
            <li>And regardless I would always have to follow-up with a hot oil treatment after applying the henna.</li>
            <li>So first,  the info you came for.  </li>
            <li>So again if it&#x27;s your first time using henna, you may need someone to help you.</li>
            <li>, for first time users:&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>(Hot water will make it fade</li>
            <li>Oddly enough, I could see the color lightly on my finger tips after running them through my hair, but it did not stain my pillow case!</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have ever dyed my hair</li>
            <li>This was my first experience with henna.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was not difficult to wash out, just fill the bathtub, and move your head around to loosen it up, then run your hands through it for a bit, then turn the shower on condition and rinse again.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be purchasing again when it&#x27;s time for a touch up :)</li>
            <li>First, you should probably mix this with some apple cider vinegar or something acidic because it helps release the chemicals in henna that dye your hair.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know exactly why this happened, it might be because my hair was already hennaed, but I can&#x27;t imagine why that would be an issue.</li>
            <li>So much easier!</li>
            <li>This was my first experience with Henna</li>
            <li>I have bought more since and will stay with this company in the future.  </li>
            <li>I used a shower cap with a hole cut in the top (exactly the directions state) to cover my head and left it for 6 hours.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s only because my hair isn&#x27;t healthy at all.</li>
            <li>I knew the henna was pretty permanent</li>
            <li>After the henna, my hair was still dry, but it felt very strong.  </li>
            <li>I just use an old towel to dry my hair and it&#x27;s all good.</li>
            <li>I just use an old towel to dry my hair and it&#x27;s all good.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s ready right away.  </li>
            <li>Lush&#x27;s red henna brick, and Light Mountain&#x27;s bright red.</li>
            <li>I still had a nice red color in my hair, and I was worried the henna would significantly darken most of my hair because of the dye and the only way to notice that I had red in my hair would be under intense sunlight.</li>
            <li>I still had a nice red color in my hair, and I was worried the henna would significantly darken most of my hair because of the dye and the only way to notice that I had red in my hair would be under intense sunlight.</li>
            <li>The color was amazing, but as other reviewers have stated, it does bleed for quite some time.</li>
            <li>I only had to use about 1/3 of the bag, so I have about 2 applications left for the whole head, which is nice for touch ups!</li>
            <li>Now I have found the color is more intense the first month or so and does fade, however, it is different from a chemical dye.</li>
            <li>The ginger for the caca rouge mixed wonderfully with my other henna and made for a very natural fiery dark red and made a great gradient with my roots.</li>
            <li>A few washes later, the color lightens up and you start noticing this gorgeous red hue, especially in light, natural or indoor.</li>

            <li>I was told my hair looked more healthy at least</li>
            <li>pleased, I will definitely buy another 100 grams very soon to upkeep the color.ine.</li>
            <li>pleased, I will definitely buy another 100 grams very soon to upkeep the color.</li>
            <li>i loveee the colorm gonnabuy more for a second application to really make the color pop  </li>
            <li>It also makes my hair super soft and shiny!</li>
            <li>the color is so much richer than the first time I applied it.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Henna Guys for making my first ever henna experience a wonder.</li>
            <li>At first, I was very reluctant because I had never used henna before.</li>
            <li>the ends were still bleached from a long time ago and it showed up better there.</li>
            <li>plus it turns my hair vibrant red, which I love.</li>
            <li>Then for a long time, I couldn&#x27;t find that same kind anymore and every type I got just made my hair orange and faded quickly.  </li>
            <li>Now on my skin it will last a day or so, but it fades very quickly.</li>
            <li>The color was not as bright as the other reviews had made it seem, I was looking for fire engine red and got more of a deep red/burgundy.</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping, and decently priced.</li>
            <li>My hair was a dark ash brown and now is a wonderful deep red</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this particular brand because I have tried henna before from different sellers but did not have the  same positive</li>
            <li>The other 2 reds I tried made my grays look shiny and pretty, but more orange.</li>
            <li>Mine didn&#x27;t  bleed as much as other user&#x27;s seem to report, however it may be because I use sulfate free organic shampoo and always wash my hair with cool water.</li>
            <li>If you want 100 percent, pure, real henna look somewhere else.</li>
            <li>The color lasted really well</li>
            <li>I will be recommending this seller/product to anyone who wants to dye their hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t care since the condition of my hair improved SO MUCH from just one use.</li>
            <li>tried some henna available at the local health food/grocery store and also online.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was truly ready to give up on henna and go the chemical dye route.</li>
            <li>but I never found one that could dye my hair that much.</li>
            <li>It really looked like the picture in the box.</li>
            <li>using this henna, I had dyed my hair with Clairol&#x27;s ammonia free box dye four months prior.</li>
            <li>using this henna, I had dyed my hair with Clairol&#x27;s ammonia free box dye four months prior.</li>
            <li>me tell you something, this stuff leaves so much buildup in my hair and it made my ends snap off.</li>
            <li>I want to see if another application in a month will make my hair a red that is noticeable in all light.</li>
            <li>my hair feels much stronger.</li>
            <li>It has a very earthy smell</li>
            <li>The whole process of putting the dye on my head took about 45 minutes.</li>
            <li>I stock up on it now and recommend it to anyone who&#x27;s not scared of intense color.</li>
            <li>one free deal has ended up paying  double shipping for flate rate package  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t really find any solution to that online either.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t have the words to express how amazed I am with the finished</li>
            <li>it really depends on what you are going for as to what you should choose.</li>
            <li>I could never do that with a chemical dye, once a month re-dying my whole head.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to do my whole head.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>But since I&#x27;m doing my whole head this time to make it all match, I&#x27;ll probably use a whole packet at one time.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>/&gt;It really smells, but it works so well that I really cannot be bothered to complain about it.</li>
            <li>The color is far more intense than you&#x27;d expect from some yellow dirt.</li>
            <li>they say you have to use the whole packet.</li>
            <li>I was really</li>
            <li>The dye came in 3.5 oz, which is twice as much as store bought henna</li>
            <li>I have been dying my hair for years with chemical dyes and bleaches, so much so my hair broke off</li>
            <li>I imagine as I get used to doing it I wont need to use so much.</li>
            <li>Fast shipment.</li>
            <li>To much work for me.</li>
            <li>I will be ordering again really soon.</li>
            <li>Thanks Henna Guys.</li>
            <li>highly reccommended!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really like having to sleep for a month with a plastic bag on my head.</li>
            <li>Went to bed with my hair wet and not even one mark on my pillowcase :).</li>
            <li>have very damaged (bleach queen)</li>
            <li>Helps my processed bleached hair feel soft again and evens out my tones from too many colors in the last year.</li>
            <li>I liked being red and wanted a natural look, so I ordered some caca rouge from lush.</li>
            <li>I have naturally extremely thick hair and although I&#x27;m fair with freckles</li>
            <li>I loved the color that developed after a few washes.</li>
            <li>Keeping my head down, I used my hands to spread the goop all into my hair, making sure to get the roots first and foremost.</li>
            <li>The instructions on this package also say to leave it in for only 2-3 hrs, which is significantly shorter than you should leave in pure henna.</li>
            <li>Henna fades to a more natural color where a chemical dye will lose the color entirely becoming dull with no luster.  </li>
            <li>However, there isn&#x27;t a lot of rich red in it likening had hoped.</li>
            <li>On color alone I can already say it&#x27;s better than box dyes, but there are some other advantages as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Other then that I love my hair now</li>
            <li>Wear something you don&#x27;t mind getting stained when you apply and be VERY careful for a day or two afterwards, to make sure all the orange is out, or you will stain your clothes/towels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Amazing long lasting color.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It should be noted that I think if you have hair that comes to your shoulder or longer, you are probably going to need more henna than the one package as I barely had enough to cover my hair.</li>
            <li>I would say, if you have really blond hair (which parts of my hair were), or have dyed your hair with chemicals... do not be surprised if your hair turns orange the first time you use</li>
            <li>I would say, if you have really blond hair (which parts of my hair were), or have dyed your hair with chemicals... do not be surprised if your hair turns orange the first time you use</li>
            <li>I tried oil treatments and leave in conditioners, but they didn&#x27;t do much and mostly just made my hair look oily and weighed it down.</li>
            <li>I originally wanted to mix two separate sets of henna so my blond roots would match the rest of my hair, but I&#x27;m lazy and figured it would be fine, so I applied it as close to my roots as a could and covered the length of my hair.</li>
            <li>any event, I want to be fair and retry this stuff a few more times because I find myself oddly addicted to the fun I have mixing it and the fact that it smells like nature, even if I didn&#x27;t get the desired color.</li>
            <li>And it doesn&#x27;t smell anywhere near as strongly, I added a couple of drops of essential oils to it when mixing with water</li>
            <li>An easy, natural red hair dye.</li>
            <li>The color may change just a tad since this is the first day of applying, but as long as it&#x27;s red, I am in love.</li>
            <li>as far as I can tell what they sent is the same product as last time, which I liked.</li>
            <li>I am a first time user of henna and I was pleasantly surprised with the results.</li>
            <li>The first time I used henna my hair was extremely dry afterward and didn&#x27;t feel as healthy as it had prior to using henna.  </li>
            <li>I was very worried after I ordered it, and did a little bit more research.</li>
            <li>I dye my hair a LOT and was ready to try something new that wouldn&#x27;t kill my hair this time.</li>
            <li>and then I conditioned my hair (to be on the safe side because I had previously bleached my hair in an attempt to strip some of the chemicals from my hair).</li>
            <li>(sides are about an inch and a half and top is about five inches)</li>
            <li>This formula left my hair the most vibrant shade of red</li>
            <li>Google led me to consider henna, and that led me to looking up reviews of this particular brand and color on Amazon.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m so glad I get to keep my deep red and</li>
            <li>It came out an extremely vibrant purple/red that lasted for a week.</li>
            <li>Let me tell you, the color came out super red!</li>
            <li>and i had to cut it super short and gave up dying it,</li>
            <li>I have super short hair</li>
            <li>I am giving this product three stars mainly because I contacted the Henna Guys with questions about the product on the day that I was going to apply it to my hair.</li>
            <li>If you have blonde hair I would imagine the color would turn out a more vibrant red.</li>
            <li>but it will definitely be a very pretty natural-looking red.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t the mess or smell so much better for your hair</li>
            <li>i left it on for 3 hours and got a beautiful color from it, though i know it will darken over the next few days.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not going to lie, the pink is pretty, but I&#x27;m not ready for that kind of commitment.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While I was shopping and decided to try this henna, I also purchased another brand that bragged about its astoundingly high lawsone content (that&#x27;s the part of henna that does the dying).</li>
            <li>highly recommend The Henna Guys.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This was my original review:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used all sorts of henna on my hair, and have found that on my natural African-American hair it created a variation in color that only I could notice.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m used to keeping a vibrant, consistent color for much longer with Rainbow brand, and when it does fade, it&#x27;s much more subtle and pleasant-looking.</li>
            <li>I read up on henna and decided I would give it a try (the prospect of it repairing my hair even a little bit was appealing).</li>
            <li>And that its all natural!!  </li>
            <li>I am an avid henna user, I dye my hair with regular pure henna about every 3 months.</li>
            <li>I ruined a couple of light shirts because my hair would still be wet and it would stain my clothing.</li>
            <li>This is by far the easiest to use among those I&#x27;ve tried because it is also so much finer.</li>
            <li>It is not 100% henna, but it is 100% natural and that is all that really matters to me.</li>
            <li>but i dont like my natural color much and</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ll stick to my natural hair rather than dye my whole house orange</li>
            <li>I mixed my henna with hibiscus tea and some fresh lemon juice.</li>
            <li>If you have blond or gray hair, the result will be more reddish orange than deep red wine at first, and you might want to try a different shade.</li>
            <li>The Henna took pretty well my first use but only dyed the lighter/pre-bleached portions of my hair and did not take to my natural roots at all.</li>
            <li>I simply mixed it with warm water, grapefruit essential oil, and the henna and left it on for 4 and 1/2 hours.</li>
            <li>if  you don&#x27;t care about bleeding and paying double shipping its worth to get it.</li>
            <li>I am allergic to almost everything, and I had no negative reaction to this.</li>
            <li>It was fun to do (a bit messy but life is short people, enjoy the journey!)</li>
            <li>way healthier than any time i used normal dyes.  </li>
            <li>I discovered my hair was bleeding orange in the shower, and with a few more showers after that, I realized the color was gradually fading.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I mixed the henna with a spice tea water and fresh lemon juice.</li>
            <li>I thought it would make my hair permanently red because every time I dye my hair something other than red, I tell myself that I&#x27;m gonna run back to red because it works best for my skin tone</li>
            <li>Beats the strong ammonia and chemical smell from conventional hair dye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I applied this brand of henna a second time around late November, same color and amount with a little more added ingredients, I was more satisfied with the result.</li>
            <li>I mixed it with strongly brewed hibiscus tea in hopes of amping the red and added about 10 drops of lavender oil for the smell.</li>
            <li>It was still bleeding after at least 50 rinses and a good soaking, very light yellow like urine, but I dried it and will follow up in 48 hours with a wash.</li>
            <li>There was some red in my water as I washed but the overall color seems fine.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product for the second time but the my first time from this particular company.  </li>
            <li>it still smells somewhat, but i&#x27;ll live.  </li>
            <li>I have (had, ugh) light blonde hair and decided to try out the red with this henna dye.</li>
            <li>I had some shipment problem  because USPS and they solved it with very professional manner even though it was not their fault.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone wanting to use a natural, non-toxic hair dye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It turns my hair a beautiful deep burgundy, with my few grays a deep copper red.</li>
            <li>: Is now a subtle, yet beautiful deep red when the sun hits it.</li>
            <li>Now while I (and apparently half the people here) think my orange hair is really freaking cool, it was not the result</li>
            <li>Now while I (and apparently half the people here) think my orange hair is really freaking cool, it was not the result</li>
            <li>They only thing I didn&#x27;t really like about this product is that it bleeds a lot!</li>
            <li>I will wait another 24 hours (it has been exactly 24 since I washed the dye out) to see what the actual color will be.</li>
            <li>first photo is very similar to the shade of my hair before using the henna.</li>
            <li>My first time was with regular henna from The Henna Guys.</li>
            <li>If you want healthy hair in a different color, check out all the Henna Guys&#x27; other colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>its does stink and color was not as vivid as i was hoping it would be</li>
            <li>I used hot water, cinnamon, and a cup of water that I steeped 2 teabags of passion tea and 2 bags of chamomile tea into to help intensify the red.</li>
            <li>decided to order a pack of Deep Red henna, because I absolutely LOVE red hair on me.</li>
            <li>But I found a bunch of pictures on the internet from people who have used red henna and it seemed to turn out very well for others!</li>
            <li>My first purchase from your company arrived last Friday.</li>
            <li>you are switching to henna from commercial hair dye, it takes some effort at first.  </li>
            <li>As a first time user of the product I will say I will never go back.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a natural light blonde that died my hair red at a salon once before using this product.</li>
            <li>Not only that, but due to the hibiscus powder, it started out looking almost black, but with strong, gorgeous purple and red highlights that bring me compliments even 2 months later.</li>
            <li>The henna gave my hair a really lovely dark red.</li>
            <li>For 5 years I&#x27;ve been using a well known semi-permanent color of dark burgundy red which I love colorwise.</li>
            <li>I have virgin naturally wavy, mixed raced hair, and because of this, the color took very well!</li>
            <li>However, it took forever to complete the first rinse and my hair continues to bleed out well over a week later.  </li>
            <li>The color came out extremely pigmented, but pretty orange, since it was pure henna.</li>
            <li>My original hair color is a dark auburn brown.</li>
            <li>and it made my hair look all one rich dark color.</li>
            <li>The color was phenomenal but the only issue is that my hair bled for a month and a half.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ve dyed my hair with regular dyes from regular super markets for years.</li>
            <li>The color is very vibrant, but not quiet as &amp;#34;Ariel Red&amp;#34; as pictured in the circle on the package.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It took half the day to mix, apply washout mix apply washout,but it was sooooo worth it!</li>
            <li>My virgin roots match the dyed areas and the whole head is more uniform, though the previous splotchiness could have been due to my henna newb status.</li>
            <li>Prior to trying the Deep/Dark Red from the Henna Guys, I was using a different brand, which I liked, but was more expensive.</li>
            <li>The directions on the packet were clear, and I followed them to the letter.  </li>
            <li>Be on the lookout for my next order very soon.</li>
            <li>, I actually didn&#x27;t use the whole packet</li>
            <li>This is by far the richest color I have ever had.</li>
            <li>No one told met that henna is almost completely irreversible and nothing will take it out.</li>
            <li>My friend recommended me to use Henna, and told me it was natural and wouldn&#x27;t hurt your hair.</li>
            <li>And WOW.</li>
            <li>My hair is above my shoulders and I had to use the whole package.</li>
            <li>Way more of a purple red than an orange red than I expected.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel soft and rejuvenated after washing it out</li>
            <li>It completely ruined my carpet.</li>
            <li>I was initially really put off by the color and tried to fade it as much as possible.  </li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll need some old clothes and towels because it stains, I slept with a towel over my pillow&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>My hair ruined everything white in our hotel room for the whole week we were there.</li>
            <li>(My natural hair color is a medium brown)</li>
            <li>In all my years I have NEVER felt my hair THAT soft.</li>
            <li>It was still soft.</li>
            <li>Baby soft hair!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised though.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After all of these years, I would never ever have believed that there was a substance that could make MY hair THIS soft.</li>
            <li>It looks really natural.</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally oily and when I use henna it takes longer for my hair to feel or look like it has oil in it.</li>
            <li>I tried different colors and all of them worked very well.</li>
            <li>It also took the whole amout of product to cover my short hair.</li>
            <li>Much healthier hair, would never go back to chemical color.  </li>
            <li>My hair now feels soft luscious and thicker.</li>
            <li>Also, the product said that henna was a natural conditioner.  </li>
            <li>My hair came out feeling like straw and completely unmanageable.  </li>
            <li>I would rather pay a professional.</li>
            <li>I saw online that people recommend using a red berry tea and that worked really well for me.</li>
            <li>i mixed it to a mash potato consistency, covered it with plastic wrap, and went to work, because i read online that you needed to let henna sit for 12 hours to be ready to use.  </li>
            <li>You mix it with just water, and you apparently don&#x27;t need to let the henna oxidize like you would normally, according to the instructions.</li>
            <li>(buy cheap conditioner for this process you will need it) and then blow dried it</li>
            <li>The color nearly matches the stock photo color, which I was surprised about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, if you have naturally curled hair - this WILL relax your curls a bit.</li>
            <li>hair feels soft and looks shiny.</li>
            <li>Instead, I have an intense red with wine highlights.  </li>
            <li>However, this company offers lots of colors to choose from.  </li>
            <li>Before applying the henna I rinsed my hair with an apple cider vinegar and water mixture to naturally strip it of oils.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m assuming the people complaining of color running didn&#x27;t rinse the henna out completely.</li>
            <li>I wrapped it in cling wrap and slept with it on, so I had it on for at least 8 hours or more before I rinsed it out.</li>
            <li>Maybe it was my mix of two hennas or my very fragrant red tea</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is so easy to use, and it actually takes me less henna using Henna Guys to do a full head application, then any other brand.</li>
            <li>you know anything about henna, real 100% pure henna does not come in any other color than red/red-orange/red-brown.</li>
            <li>I gave up after two bleaches because it was just getting to be too hard to go from one end of the spectrum to the other without paying a good chunk of money at the salon to have them do</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was not aware that I would have to reapply the henna more than once to get the deep red shade I want.</li>
            <li>/&gt;To make a long story short, if you want healthy red hair and want to be properly rewarded for all the work and time that applying henna requires, BUY THIS HENNA!</li>
            <li>Use a bunch of wet paper towels to clean up any spillage you have while applying because no matter how care you are, it will inevitably get on the floor and on yourself.</li>
            <li>hair feels super soft, even the ends which were slightly</li>
            <li>I was a little nervous trying it at first, because it is really permanent and you can&#x27;t change it with chemical dye if you end up not liking it</li>
            <li>I thought this rinsed easier than the previous henna had and the final color is darker yet has more red tones.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying to dye my hair a vibrant red for years.</li>
            <li>I left it on over night (about 7 hours) but prior to applying it I let the mix (henna, hibiscus, honey,acv, cinnamon, tresseme conditioner, oils, and hot boiling water) sit over night.</li>
            <li>First application left my roots the desired red and everything else orange, some spots were even a blackish color...</li>
            <li>Also, the results stayed vibrant for only about five days before the color started fading dramatically.</li>
            <li>and I must say that this henna was high quality henna and is the only brand that I will be using from here on out.</li>
            <li>3 hours later I am a deep red color exactly what I was going for!</li>
            <li>far as the color is concerned, I really wasn&#x27;t expecting deep red.</li>
            <li>I DID get some orange stains on my forehead but after washing my face it went away almost completely and was barely visible, but still visible.</li>
            <li>Still dark but with rich red tones.</li>
            <li>Even some reviewers with virgin hair are reporting the bleeding and acting like that is normal for henna dyes.</li>
            <li>when i got back, i added a little more vinegar, hot water, and a little almond oil to get it to a yogurt consistency</li>
            <li>When I first applied it (I got the color Auburn), the result came out SUPER firetruck red (I&#x27;m a natural blonde, and my hair was a little red from the previous dye job)-- which I read was pretty normal.</li>
            <li>I was also a bit put off about having to let the henna sit in my hair for hours, rather than just the quick 25 minutes with chemical dyes, but it wasn&#x27;t a problem you can make the henna thick like a past and then put it all up in a shower cap, and go about your business, its like using a hair mask :)</li>
            <li>I had previously dyed it (to many times) trying to get a deep red and last week used a competitors henna that had sort of reddened it to what I wanted but was orange in some areas.</li>
            <li>the exact color I want without the harsh effects or smell of normal hair dye.</li>
            <li>any event, I want to be fair and retry this stuff a few more times because I find myself oddly addicted to the fun I have mixing it and the fact that it smells like nature, even if I didn&#x27;t get the desired color.me the wrong package for how orange my hair was.</li>
            <li>The application was super messy and I had to have someone help me.</li>
            <li>The instructions are very clear and simple.</li>
            <li>I was absolutely blown away by how much it repaired my damaged, dry hair (again), and how VIBRANT the color came out on my dark brown hair!</li>
            <li>It also covered my greys and made them a pretty ruby color where the other made them orange.</li>
            <li>I thought this would only work on light colored hair, but it worked really well on my dark brown, previously dyed, hair.</li>
            <li>I read a lot of online tutorials about henna in general, to get some pointers because this stuff is somewhat of an undertaking.  </li>
            <li>Apparently henna darkens over 48 hours after dying because it doesn&#x27;t have the additives that speed up the coloring process.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really wanted to finish what I had left, but I eventually gave in and bought the Deep Red color from the Henna Guys.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve made up my mind to go as natural as I possibly can when it comes to hair products.</li>
            <li>I wanted to maintain red hair without using pharmacy box dyes, even if they contain no ammonia like Natural Instincts.</li>
            <li>already had red in the ends of my hair, but it seems to have blended almost seamlessly with my roots.</li>
            <li>Remember that red hair dye no matter if it&#x27;s synthetic or natural, will always come out the quickest.</li>
            <li>and when I looked at my hair, the red had faded considerable amount.</li>
            <li>, I go to Lush at the mall and got a cacao red to brown it up at bit.</li>
            <li>Shipping arrived much faster than expected.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally brown hair and the color turned out a deep burgundy.</li>
            <li>And anyone that tells you that it was, isn&#x27;t washing out their normal hair dye enough as it is, or they&#x27;re not mixing the henna well enough.</li>
            <li>I had to deep condition to get my hair back to normal.  </li>
            <li>Nice way to skip the chemicaly expensive trips to Sally&#x27;s beauty for me and do my stuff at home without a hitch.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I did a little more research online, so this was my procedure: 1 and a half cups purified water for 100 grams of product and 1/4 organic lemon juice (or the juice of 2 organic lemons).</li>
            <li>After a few moments I took it down and touched the top of my head.</li>
            <li>anyone knows how long i can wait before I dye it again with regular dye or if I could bleach over it and revert back to my chemical hair dye that&#x27;d be great.&lt;br /&gt;Overall extremely disappointed, especially since I paid a lot more than normal for something I thought would be more beneficial for me.</li>
            <li>I thought the beautiful dark red color would stay at least a little better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This brand was my first ever henna application on previously chemically dyed hair.</li>
            <li>The dark red gives absolutely gorgeous color for the first 2 weeks but has been leaching out with every wash like crazy</li>
            <li>the package says it will tone down in the next few days, and i certainly hope so, because i&#x27;m not sure my boss will be thrilled.  </li>
            <li>The texture makes it easy to cover all your hair with less henna and means less clumps of</li>
            <li>Well when I first mixed the henna with water it was a dark burnt orange color</li>
            <li>I tried this henna after using Lush&#x27;s red henna bricks, and chemical dyes prior to that.</li>
            <li>It will not make you look like a natural red head on any level, but at the same time it is not overly unnatural.</li>
            <li>I left it in for a good 3 hours and rinsed out with cold water as directed.</li>
            <li>A little orange on the first dye....</li>
            <li>(specially if you have thick, curl/ wavy, ethnic  hair, like myself).c  hair, like myself).</li>
            <li>My hair has been dyed in the past so it did not come out as super red as it did on my roots.</li>
            <li>However,  due to me having the extremely damaged hair, it faded quick</li>
            <li>It darkened my already dark brown hair kind of like dark red lipstick that is almost black.</li>
            <li>I had previously done my research and did NOT follow the instructions that came with the product because I wanted a very vibrant color.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li>It stunk to high heaven, so much so that I could hardly tolerate it.</li>
            <li>This is definitely my favorite color to choose but be aware that red is very difficult to cover if you decide to change back to a brown henna!</li>
            <li>Left stains on my pillow cases and towels every time i got my hair wet, if you are a first time henna user (they don&#x27;t tell you this on here of course) but you need to apply it twice for it to go red, and if you have long hair</li>
            <li>I originally have dark brown hair and it turned my hair dark red</li>
            <li>so I have enough left for a whole other treatment.</li>
            <li>It was very dark red the first</li>
            <li>So, if you have dark hair, don&#x27;t expect the intense fiery red you see in their models, but</li>
            <li>I have had Henna for my hair for a long time now, and had previously been pretty faithful to another web retailer, until now.</li>
            <li>To me, the fantastic color this left was not worth the trouble of having bleeding red hair.</li>
            <li>I had used pure henna a few years ago on chemically-treated hair with permanent results that didn&#x27;t bleed.</li>
            <li>This might be *slightly* cheaper, but it&#x27;s worth the few extra dollars to buy Rainbow henna directly from [...] , or here on Amazon or Puritan&#x27;s Pride.</li>
            <li>Okay, so my hair was half black (front), half red (back).</li>

            <li> is a good product.</li>
            <li> are always stopping me and asking me what i use to get my hair so gorgeous.</li>
            <li> Gorgeous color,</li>
            <li> but I loved how my hair came out...</li>
            <li> Good Evening.</li>
            <li> This brand and color is just as good and WAY cheaper.</li>
            <li> Just give me the good stuff from Sally&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I found some really good advice.  </li>
            <li> also, applying vaseline to your hairline, neck, and ears is a really good trick to keep it from staining there.  </li>
            <li> the color is good</li>
            <li> The color looks good.</li>
            <li> and I have to say I absolutely loved this product and the way it turned out on chemically colored hair.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t even get me started on how magnificent it looks when the sunlight is hitting it at the right angle!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t even get me started on how magnificent it looks when the sunlight is hitting it at the right angle!</li>
            <li> so I decided to to purchase; it is a great quality Henna and the color true to picture!!  </li>
            <li> The paste is very smooth and is of great quality.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found a hairdresser to make me happy yet, to top it of i am SEVERELY allergic to chemical hair dyes.</li>
            <li> great colour, always comes out healthy.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with the purchase of this Henna.</li>
            <li> Loved the color but every time it would rain- or after a nice swim- my clothes would be stained.</li>
            <li> I was impressed that this henna doesn&#x27;t require time to sit (you just mix and put it right on).</li>
            <li> The red is so brilliant and awesome.</li>
            <li> After using this, I would say that this is a good product, but you have to take the right steps!!!</li>
            <li> My favorite henna on the market!</li>
            <li> I am in love!</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t ask for anything better!</li>
            <li> And i love the result!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I was a bit apprehensive about how it would turn out; but I&#x27;m so glad I tried it out!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already gotten many complements on my hair!</li>
            <li> I must say, I love it!  </li>
            <li> Love you Henna Guys!</li>
            <li> Many users suggest using teas to scent the water, and for that I thank them!</li>
            <li> I love this product!  </li>
            <li> and I love it!</li>
            <li> and I get so many compliments!</li>
            <li> Love the hair dye!  </li>
            <li> I love henna!</li>
            <li> and I love getting my henna from The Henna Guys!</li>
            <li> I AM IN LOVE!</li>
            <li> but I love the color!</li>
            <li> The color is beautiful, a perfect red, giving my espresso hair a cherry cola color.</li>
            <li> the color is amazing.</li>
            <li> My hair isn&#x27;t shiny, it isn&#x27;t softer than it was before I started, it doesn&#x27;t look amazing or anything.</li>
            <li> The results are amazing.</li>
            <li> If you have never dyed with henna before, go to hennaforhair.com, it&#x27;s an amazing site with all kinds of tips and instructions.</li>
            <li> My hair smelled and felt muddy for like 3 days, but honestly...</li>
            <li> I thought it would be a good deal since you get more of it</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the best henna I have ever found!  </li>
            <li> For those complaining about how this runs for many shampoos afterward, well, that is just the price you pay with henna for good coverage that gets the roots.</li>
            <li> I quite literally detest this dye and never will do my own hair again.</li>
            <li> How do you explain yellow/orange marks on all of a nice hotels linens.</li>
            <li> I really liked it...</li>
            <li> It was still warm to the touch.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I also noticed that my hair has a nice &amp;#34;deep red&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I just mix with warm water as directed.  </li>
            <li> so thats nice.</li>
            <li> actually kind of hope it lightens up some.</li>
            <li> Perhaps I could have thinned it out some more, but it didn&#x27;t seem like a good idea.</li>
            <li> (Then he tells me he liked it the way it was.</li>
            <li> I decided to try the Henna Guys out on a whim and ended up LOVING IT.</li>
            <li> The color is bright and beautiful exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> great sellers with great high quality henna!</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s my honest feedback:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The color is beautiful, the product is smooth and easy to use, but it bleeds and bleeds and bleeds!</li>
            <li> However, I recieved the product very very quickly, and it was amazing!</li>
            <li> /&gt;To be fair, it did leave my hair feeling better once I applied conditioner on top of the henna and</li>
            <li> /&gt;To be fair, it did leave my hair feeling better once I applied conditioner on top of the henna and</li>
            <li> I love the results and I will be for sure ordering again!</li>
            <li> The best I can describe the color is a beautiful black cherry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to using straight up BAQ henna to dye my hair, which produces a very bright, orangey color (think of Lucille Ball).  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I searched the web and ended up buying what is probably the most popular brand in the US.</li>
            <li> but so far this is the best I found.</li>
            <li> After years of dying my hair and spending hundreds of dollars on professional color, I  am so happy to have found this!</li>
            <li> The color is intense and beautiful.  </li>
            <li> It has a very smooth consistency no clumps or anything.</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful bright red!</li>
            <li> The texture of the mixture is nice and fine.</li>
            <li> My hair looks better every time I use</li>
            <li> Tip: the longer you leave it in your hair the better the results.</li>
            <li> i love it.</li>
            <li> but it sure did restore it.</li>
            <li> I love this henna, I&#x27;ve tried the Rainbow brand henna before</li>
            <li> This is more cherry.</li>
            <li> Then I lifted my head, piled my hair on the top of my head, and kept massaging the mix onto my head until I used all the of the mix.</li>
            <li> , I have dyed my hair so many times since I was 14.</li>
            <li> and I sincerely regret allowing this to touch my hair.</li>
            <li> Will keep using this henna :)</li>
            <li> I will be able to dye my hair twice from one packet.</li>
            <li> , It cover all my grays and I love the results.</li>
            <li> I just love this product.</li>
            <li> I love this product and will look forward to buying more...</li>
            <li> I love it.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li> Every time I touched my hair, more orange stains.</li>
            <li> that being said, I still love the color in my hair.</li>
            <li> As in I need to use way more of this powder to get the job done, because it&#x27;s not all henna.</li>
            <li> I love using the Henna hair dye so much more than store bought dye</li>
            <li> and it smells like nature :).</li>
            <li> love it best red color henna ive used.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love, this brand.  </li>
            <li> The customer service is also top notch.  </li>
            <li> They will answer any questions with a great attitude and very promptly.</li>
            <li> and I LOVE  it.</li>
            <li> I just did it again 2 days ago as a matter of fact :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so pleased.</li>
            <li> I love this nashville all had dye</li>
            <li> I have been using this product now for about 8 months and my hair has never looked or felt better.</li>
            <li> seems help it penetrate my kinky resistant hair better</li>
            <li> Not even being able to brush your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> why am so glad I found this!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Getting complements &amp; love how soft/strong/thick my hair feels(use</li>
            <li> I love this stuff</li>
            <li> I am SO glad that I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love both colors,  </li>
            <li> Applying to your hair is more of a process because it is like a mud mask that you are putting on your hair.  </li>
            <li> I have gotten henna on tile, counter top, my hands, and I have not had an issue with staining.</li>
            <li> It worked so much better than my hair dye.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s okay to do that with henna since it doesn&#x27;t hurt your hair.  </li>
            <li> at the point now where I think all the dyed hair has been trimmed off and it looks so much better with the henna.  </li>
            <li> does a better job of sticking to my hair, and skin than it does the counters.&lt;br</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m allergic to scented soaps, metals, and most cosmetic makeups for those looking for specifics.)&lt;br /&gt;»Buying it in bulk</li>
            <li> When you go to wash it out, it should take maybe two minutes at most.</li>
            <li> I love the product a lot.</li>
            <li> , if you&#x27;re looking for bright shiny red hair, this is a great product.</li>
            <li> When I applied it I thought i might have problems because I had 1-2 inches gown out and ends that had been colored many times.  </li>
            <li> The color turned out lovely.</li>
            <li> I bought this product and at first the color turned out AMAZING!  </li>
            <li> be sure to wear gloves also, this stuff stains IMMEDIATELY.  </li>
            <li> next, we wrapped my head in plastic wrap (the cling type works best) and put on a shower cap, and went to watch a movie.  </li>
            <li> here&#x27;s the link to the tutorial i found most helpful:</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> i love my results</li>
            <li> but i am now love it</li>
            <li> So, I decided to try this stuff, to see if it was any better.</li>
            <li> wait 1-2 days to shampoo my hair after Henna, to make sure I don&#x27;t cause loss of color before it&#x27;s fully set.</li>
            <li> The color is absolutely stunning, no kidding.  </li>
            <li> I love these guys.</li>
            <li> I thought I have read most the reviews</li>
            <li> It could have worked better.</li>
            <li> I have used henna hair dye before and this is one of the better</li>
            <li> but I have to disagree with most of the reviewers on the smell level</li>
            <li> The more you dye your hair with henna, the darker the outcome color, and this was my case.</li>
            <li> Not nearly as red in the picture, but still very beautiful.</li>
            <li> I love love love this product.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t even need conditioner as my hair felt so healthy already.</li>
            <li> so I could get the best possible color.</li>
            <li> The final result was PERFECT.</li>
            <li> I totally love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This stuff is officially my favorite henna dye.</li>
            <li> I really like the color turned  out very nice.</li>
            <li> Perfect root coverage and deep, rich color!</li>
            <li> You may not be impressed at first right after your shower, and that&#x27;s absolutely fine.</li>
            <li> The color stays pretty bright for about a month.</li>
            <li> There is a bit of a learning curve with that, but there are some pretty good instructional videos on YouTube if you are worried about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair feels healthy and strong, unlike box dye which fries my ends.</li>
            <li> The customer service is more than helpful and responds very quickly.</li>
            <li> Amazing results &amp; fast shipping!!</li>
            <li> It also had great reviews on the lovely rosey red color, and I was even more eager to try that one.</li>
            <li> My color is great, my hair is just a soft as before if not softer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Nupur brand at $4 a a package with free shipping, so unless this brand is considerably better, I&#x27;ll stick with the $4 package of henna.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty experienced with using henna to dye my hair and i usually use Rainbow brand, which works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> Great if you are going all natural, though.</li>
            <li> I love that this stuff is organic and free of magnetic salts.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t remember much about the color, don&#x27;t think it did a good job.</li>
            <li> orange sweat doesn&#x27;t really  look good.</li>
            <li> The red is gorgeous!</li>
            <li> The color is definitely more red now, and my hair is still looking great.</li>
            <li> The color is definitely more red now, and my hair is still looking great.</li>
            <li> I thought it was really easy to apply and use</li>
            <li> The roots are definately bright but as the white hair grows out I can tell it will make nice highlights around my face.</li>
            <li> It comes off easily with water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It tangles easily.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I found the mixture really easy to apply.</li>
            <li> So vibrant and bright.</li>
            <li> The purple tones still come out, just not as strongly as before.</li>
            <li> The purple tones still come out, just not as strongly as before.</li>
            <li> It is amazing how consistently it applies all over the hair.</li>
            <li> I liked the color it gave my hair at first</li>
            <li> First off they ship FAST so great device for that.</li>
            <li> lavender, a smell I typically despise, did a wonderful job at distracting from it.&lt;br /&gt;»Does</li>
            <li> (i know some people say not to, but it was fine)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been about 3 weeks since my initial dye and my hair still looks awesome even with washing with hot water.</li>
            <li> I will buy from this seller again and am very excited to see how it would look on my new growing healthy hair!</li>
            <li> This henna goes on so smooth and not clumpy</li>
            <li> And yes, my mother used the gloves while applying (although the gloves supplied were cheap and broke on her, thus her getting orange stained hands for a couple of days) .</li>
            <li> My roommate helped me put it on my hair with a dye brush and things went smoothly.</li>
            <li> I was very worried it would stain my ears and face, but honestly it didn&#x27;t leave any stains.</li>
            <li> It just smells of hay lightly.</li>
            <li> How does that sound?</li>
            <li> They are as advertised,  metallic salt free.  </li>
            <li> I re-dyed a week later and it got darker orange lol</li>
            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t like light or moisture.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s at my shoulders now) and attempt to still enjoy dying my hair.</li>
            <li> and I keep trying different brands because I hadn&#x27;t found one that I was really happy with.</li>
            <li> The color is absolutely fabulous.</li>
            <li> It is also really important to me that this is a chemical free product that conditions my hair rather than damaging it like tradition hair dyes.</li>
            <li> this stuff not only effectively stains hair...but everything you own.</li>
            <li> So the henna seems to be far superior.  </li>
            <li> but overall it&#x27;s a good product :)</li>
            <li> The girls at Lush loved my color.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I let the water run clear, then combed my hair out, washed again for good measure and my hair was still leaking orange all over the place.</li>
            <li> Word to the wise: if you&#x27;re going to use this product, put a towel or old pillowcase over your pillow before you go to sleep, because this WILL stain your pillowcases.&lt;br</li>
            <li> far as longevity, I didn&#x27;t wash my hair for 48 hours afterward and have washed it in warm water with color safe hair products once.</li>
            <li> Very red very rich and very easy!</li>
            <li> Absolutely Perfect and just what the previous reviews said!  </li>
            <li> Overall I love their henna!!</li>
            <li> The color is so vibrant, but still appropriate for most work situations.</li>
            <li> It was easy to apply and because of the smooth consistency I was able to color my whole head.</li>
            <li> nice vibrant color.  </li>
            <li> I used it for quite a while, but it seemed like my roots were showing more and more, until there were a good two inches of roots with little to no coverage, even after they would have received about three applications by then.</li>
            <li> While most of the semi-permanent dyes were vegetable based dyes, I still utilized quite a bit of the other chemical dyes as well as a good quantity of strong bleach.</li>
            <li> It makes the hair feel like you washed it with dirt for the first two days when you first get it out, but feels awesome after the next shampoo</li>
            <li> The end result was well worth the wait!  </li>
            <li> is significantly cheaper than purchasing chemical hair dye from the store, or online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Will update after I get my $28 worth of henna!</li>
            <li> It was a lot of fun to mix (like playing with mud!).</li>
            <li> My hair has never felt more healthy and soft!  </li>
            <li> I have gotten so many compliments, from the first day I had it in to a month + afterwards.</li>
            <li> so, i used some apple cider vinegar (make sure it is unfiltered with the mother, because otherwise it won&#x27;t have all the nutritional benefits) and some HOT water.  </li>
            <li> I love it so much that I have converted my sister and mother to using The Henna Guys too!</li>
            <li> It covered the grey great.</li>
            <li> but so worth it when its rinsed out and finished!</li>
            <li> The smell is fairly pleasant, much better than some other hennas I&#x27;ve tried and not at all objectionable.</li>
            <li> This honestly worked better than the hair dye I had just recently (about a month ago) applied to my hair.</li>
            <li> It was really worth it, easy to mix and somewhat a pain to apply.</li>
            <li> I suggest putting a mirror in your tub and doing it there for faster clean up.</li>
            <li> I was swayed by the overwhelming positive reviews for this product and decided to buy myself 100</li>
            <li> right now.&lt;br /&gt;The Henna product from this Amazon site was easy to apply and clean up.</li>
            <li> My hair came out with the most wonderful darker brown with some awesome red highlights which used to be my ugly grays.  </li>
            <li> I waited 4 weeks after my initial salon dye before applying the henna and had been washing my hair with warm/hot water to ensure the original dye faded a fair amount</li>
            <li> This Henna right here does everything it claims to do!  </li>
            <li> It has a lovely smooth and slippery texture that makes application a dream and is a sign of high quality henna.</li>
            <li> With this dye my scalp is clear, not flaky, and the color is amazing.  </li>
            <li> I love the color my hair turned out, this henna is good quality, I have dark brown  </li>
            <li> Perhaps it is the hibiscus that is running bright yellow in my shower and staining my towels</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as bright as the picture because I don&#x27;t have blonde hair</li>
            <li> I am equally convinced that the Henna Guys have managed to find and obtain a superior quality of henna that even discerning natives would scramble to get.</li>
            <li> I left it on just over 3 hours with 2 processing caps and a sock cap on then \\&quot;washed\\&quot; with a fair amount of V05 conditioner.</li>
            <li> Full disclosure: I did mix in around 2T of hibiscus powder before I realized it was already listed in the(2) ingredients.</li>
            <li> It has a good texture when mixed</li>
            <li> The smell was not bad at all - like the package says it smells like nature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The smell everyone complains about was not bad at all.</li>
            <li> It is very messy, but as you become more experienced with using henna, it gets easier.  </li>
            <li> I found it easy to apply and the color turned out lovely (pretty much like the pictures).</li>
            <li> and I really appreciated that I&#x27;ve found a way to feel pretty without a million chemicals I can&#x27;t pronounce!!!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll try to add some photos soon!a beautiful black cherry.</li>
            <li> , it makes my hair feel full of life and super shiny.</li>
            <li> First application was bright but beautiful, second darkened it to exactly the red auburn I was aiming for</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will probably switch back to a pure henna to try to stop the bleeding, but if my hair still bleeds I will happily upgrade my rating of this product.</li>
            <li> I thought I must be missing some steps, but it turned out gorgeous!</li>
            <li> other than that its great, i get a lot of compliments.</li>
            <li> And with the most lovely deep henna color ever!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Luckily it has not stained my towels.  </li>
            <li> but it fades really quickly.</li>
            <li> My hair now has a red wine \\&quot;glow\\&quot; to it and looks amazing in the light.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t even had chemical dyes look this bold before.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The package arrived quickly, included instructions and gloves.</li>
            <li> And I recommend if you&#x27;re pregnant or just dont want chemicals on your body.</li>
            <li> It got such good reviews and the price was right, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  </li>
            <li> I would say the color is very true, A beautiful Deep Red.</li>
            <li> I went with Henna because I read it dyed great over dark hair</li>
            <li> But overall I am very pleased with the way it made my hair look and feel.</li>
            <li> And it lasted a good long time.</li>
            <li> You have a new loyal customer. :-)</li>
            <li> It is a darker red than I normally use and at first I wasn&#x27;t sure I loved the color.</li>
            <li> , I love my new color.</li>
            <li> It came with very detailed instructions and was very simple and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I used this henna just a week after applying Lush&#x27;s Caca Rouge henna and I loved that it made my hair a very nice deep red.</li>
            <li> Even though my hair was so dark my hair turned a nice bright browny-red with super red highlights in the light.</li>
            <li> With this batch, my hair never bled at all after the first rinse, and my hands didn&#x27;t stain at all!</li>
            <li> THIS red is my favorite!</li>
            <li> I will definitely buy this again :) and again and again!</li>
            <li> Thanks for a great product especially for a first time henna user.</li>
            <li> I will definitely order more!  </li>
            <li> I am so in love with my new hair right now</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a beautiful, rich deep red &amp; my hair feels like heaven!!</li>
            <li> It is much more red than the other product I used (which gave my hair more of a natural gingery color) and fades beautifully over time.</li>
            <li> I even used a light brown towel during the whole dye process and that didn&#x27;t stain either.</li>
            <li> My hair feels soft, looks shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li> it was worth it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I honestly can&#x27;t remember the last time someone had complimented my hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s 100% worth it for me.</li>
            <li> I honestly can&#x27;t remember the last time someone had complimented my hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s 100% worth it for me.</li>
            <li> The henna masked my Clairol dye wonderfully without darkening it too much and the red is definitely noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The henna masked my Clairol dye wonderfully without darkening it too much and the red is definitely noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> it does smell a bit like hay while applied but the color you acheive is worth the three or four hours of stinking</li>
            <li> Beautiful and true color, deep red.</li>
            <li> On top of that, my hair has never been more healthy, thick, shiny and amazing!Ppl</li>
            <li> I recommend buying your own since mine ripped almost immediately when I tried to cover my massive hair.</li>
            <li> The Henna Guys wins out hands down.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now the first time I used a whole pack, so if it is your first time using henna,  you may need more until you&#x27;re used to it.  </li>
            <li> the smell of this product and the 2-3 hour wait for the color may suck, but the results of the color is totally worth it...</li>
            <li> I can say, this is my favorite thus far.</li>
            <li> The color continues to fade and I sincerely hope that it fades out completely.  </li>
            <li> Beautiful vibrant color, minimal bleeding!</li>
            <li> I bought this with much anticipation and was hoping that my hair would turn a beautiful shade with red highlights and a nice sheen over my black hair</li>
            <li> On my medium brown hair, I got a rich, deep red, and I got a lot of really great compliments on it.  </li>
            <li> That night my fianc&amp;eacute; said \\&quot;when did you dye your hair bright red?\\&quot; This is the first time in my history with various henna products that anyone has ever noticed!&lt;br /&gt;Compared to many other hennas this was easy to use, just mix then apply.</li>
            <li> arrived far more quickly than I expected, and that made me thrilled before I even started.</li>
            <li> The shade stuck right away and shimmers in the sun.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll ruin towels too right after a washing your hair.</li>
            <li> When it was all melty and the right consistency, I covered it with a damp paper towel</li>
            <li> The henna takes about 2-3 days to fully oxidize, and even then you may not be completely impressed, it may seem too dark or not as RED as you wished.</li>
            <li> The henna takes about 2-3 days to fully oxidize, and even then you may not be completely impressed, it may seem too dark or not as RED as you wished.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although I remain impressed by the way it provided deep pigment over dark non-chemically treated African-American hair.</li>
            <li> My hair turned a beautiful deep red just as explained.</li>
            <li> I use warm water (not piping hot) and after an initial rinse in water I use conditioner to help get the rest out.</li>
            <li> Mixed together like pudding, very easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It took 12 hours to dye release, left a copper color and smelled VERY strongly of hay for WEEKS.</li>
            <li> But after one henna treatment my hair felt amazing, and I knew right away that I&#x27;d be using it for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i used a packet and a half, mixed in a metal bowl, and this worked perfectly.  </li>
            <li> I loved the color, but it is super messy.</li>
            <li> ok, so i&#x27;ve only dyed my hair a handful of times in my life, and i&#x27;ve never been terribly pleased with the results, and it always fades completely by 2-3 weeks.  </li>
            <li> Much more vibrant than I thought, but still fine for a regular look.  </li>
            <li> If pure henna bleeds, I will assume the problem is my hair!</li>
            <li> absolutely recommend this product to anyone who wishes for healthy, glossy, natural looking red-hued hair.</li>

            <li> excellent color and hair is now thick and soft.</li>
            <li> The last time I colored my hair, I was looking for something that would give me a darker, deeper red color, but was still all-natural - and this seemed like a great choice.  </li>
            <li> For those looking for a natural red, this might be too bright.  </li>
            <li> One thing i noticed is you can barely notice any colour in photos, but in natural light it looks stunning.</li>
            <li> we were outside and instead of the sun showing a nice red henna tint it showed bright yellow.</li>
            <li> and it came very very fast</li>
            <li> my hair continued to bleed, but it was a very, very light yellow color and my scalp was beginning to hurt</li>
            <li> It seemed to have stopped a bit, but the running doesn&#x27;t seem to take away from the color very much.</li>
            <li> Very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I was so excited about the initial results that I purchased a huge package of it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many red hennas on the market right now, Light Mountain, Henna Maiden, Lush....</li>
            <li> I guess I should mention though that it is in fact pure henna because it did not react with chemical dyes afterwards, so it is worth one star.</li>
            <li> and it seems positive I wil right a nother one tonight when finished.</li>
            <li> have used Henna in the past, but never had such great results as this!</li>
            <li> In fact, I was even happier than the first time.</li>
            <li> Was more of an earthy Brick Red.</li>
            <li> But my hair turned a deep burgundy color that I adore, became ridiculously healthy and fuller, and I got tons of compliments on the shine and color.</li>
            <li> I tried adding herbal tea and hibiscus to try to get some more color, but to the same results.</li>
            <li> The color has faded since I first did it.  </li>
            <li> This was my first experience with Henna.</li>
            <li> You will get a lovely deep garnet color.</li>
            <li> this is my first.</li>
            <li> Okay so first things first, I bought this product in Deep Red.&lt;br /&gt;Second</li>
            <li> dyed my roots a lovely red color, but the rest of my hair was unchanged.&lt;br /&gt;Let</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ruined so many white clothes and a number of pillows and pillow cases...</li>
            <li> It washes out in the laundry, but I panicked at first.</li>
            <li> pretty fishy.</li>
            <li> I can safely say that I will never go back to dyes with chemicals in it!</li>
            <li> This was my first time using henna.</li>
            <li> This is the first time that I used Henna on my hair.  </li>
            <li> color is always super vibrant, even a month after henna-ing.</li>
            <li> Thanks Henna Guys!</li>
            <li> but maybe I didn&#x27;t reach those ones with the mix,there&#x27;s also things you can add to help cover grays or make it more red/blk, there&#x27;s a lot of YouTube videos on Henna.&lt;br /&gt;color,Thining hair,Grays or if just healthier hair,I can&#x27;t say about(brand)being i&#x27;ve only tryd this1.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> luck ;)</li>
            <li> And regardless I would always have to follow-up with a hot oil treatment after applying the henna.</li>
            <li> So first,  the info you came for.  </li>
            <li> So again if it&#x27;s your first time using henna, you may need someone to help you.</li>
            <li> , for first time users:&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> (Hot water will make it fade</li>
            <li> Oddly enough, I could see the color lightly on my finger tips after running them through my hair, but it did not stain my pillow case!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have ever dyed my hair</li>
            <li> This was my first experience with henna.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was not difficult to wash out, just fill the bathtub, and move your head around to loosen it up, then run your hands through it for a bit, then turn the shower on condition and rinse again.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be purchasing again when it&#x27;s time for a touch up :)</li>
            <li> First, you should probably mix this with some apple cider vinegar or something acidic because it helps release the chemicals in henna that dye your hair.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know exactly why this happened, it might be because my hair was already hennaed, but I can&#x27;t imagine why that would be an issue.</li>
            <li> So much easier!</li>
            <li> This was my first experience with Henna</li>
            <li> I have bought more since and will stay with this company in the future.  </li>
            <li> I used a shower cap with a hole cut in the top (exactly the directions state) to cover my head and left it for 6 hours.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s only because my hair isn&#x27;t healthy at all.</li>
            <li> I knew the henna was pretty permanent</li>
            <li> After the henna, my hair was still dry, but it felt very strong.  </li>
            <li> I just use an old towel to dry my hair and it&#x27;s all good.</li>
            <li> I just use an old towel to dry my hair and it&#x27;s all good.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ready right away.  </li>
            <li> Lush&#x27;s red henna brick, and Light Mountain&#x27;s bright red.</li>
            <li> I still had a nice red color in my hair, and I was worried the henna would significantly darken most of my hair because of the dye and the only way to notice that I had red in my hair would be under intense sunlight.</li>
            <li> I still had a nice red color in my hair, and I was worried the henna would significantly darken most of my hair because of the dye and the only way to notice that I had red in my hair would be under intense sunlight.</li>
            <li> The color was amazing, but as other reviewers have stated, it does bleed for quite some time.</li>
            <li> I only had to use about 1/3 of the bag, so I have about 2 applications left for the whole head, which is nice for touch ups!</li>
            <li> Now I have found the color is more intense the first month or so and does fade, however, it is different from a chemical dye.</li>
            <li> The ginger for the caca rouge mixed wonderfully with my other henna and made for a very natural fiery dark red and made a great gradient with my roots.</li>
            <li> A few washes later, the color lightens up and you start noticing this gorgeous red hue, especially in light, natural or indoor.</li>

            <li> I was told my hair looked more healthy at least</li>
            <li> pleased, I will definitely buy another 100 grams very soon to upkeep the color.ine.</li>
            <li> pleased, I will definitely buy another 100 grams very soon to upkeep the color.</li>
            <li> i loveee the colorm gonnabuy more for a second application to really make the color pop  </li>
            <li> It also makes my hair super soft and shiny!</li>
            <li> the color is so much richer than the first time I applied it.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Henna Guys for making my first ever henna experience a wonder.</li>
            <li> At first, I was very reluctant because I had never used henna before.</li>
            <li> the ends were still bleached from a long time ago and it showed up better there.</li>
            <li> plus it turns my hair vibrant red, which I love.</li>
            <li> Then for a long time, I couldn&#x27;t find that same kind anymore and every type I got just made my hair orange and faded quickly.  </li>
            <li> Now on my skin it will last a day or so, but it fades very quickly.</li>
            <li> The color was not as bright as the other reviews had made it seem, I was looking for fire engine red and got more of a deep red/burgundy.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping, and decently priced.</li>
            <li> My hair was a dark ash brown and now is a wonderful deep red</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this particular brand because I have tried henna before from different sellers but did not have the  same positive</li>
            <li> The other 2 reds I tried made my grays look shiny and pretty, but more orange.</li>
            <li> Mine didn&#x27;t  bleed as much as other user&#x27;s seem to report, however it may be because I use sulfate free organic shampoo and always wash my hair with cool water.</li>
            <li> If you want 100 percent, pure, real henna look somewhere else.</li>
            <li> The color lasted really well</li>
            <li> I will be recommending this seller/product to anyone who wants to dye their hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t care since the condition of my hair improved SO MUCH from just one use.</li>
            <li> tried some henna available at the local health food/grocery store and also online.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was truly ready to give up on henna and go the chemical dye route.</li>
            <li> but I never found one that could dye my hair that much.</li>
            <li> It really looked like the picture in the box.</li>
            <li> using this henna, I had dyed my hair with Clairol&#x27;s ammonia free box dye four months prior.</li>
            <li> using this henna, I had dyed my hair with Clairol&#x27;s ammonia free box dye four months prior.</li>
            <li> me tell you something, this stuff leaves so much buildup in my hair and it made my ends snap off.</li>
            <li> I want to see if another application in a month will make my hair a red that is noticeable in all light.</li>
            <li> my hair feels much stronger.</li>
            <li> It has a very earthy smell</li>
            <li> The whole process of putting the dye on my head took about 45 minutes.</li>
            <li> I stock up on it now and recommend it to anyone who&#x27;s not scared of intense color.</li>
            <li> one free deal has ended up paying  double shipping for flate rate package  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t really find any solution to that online either.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t have the words to express how amazed I am with the finished</li>
            <li> it really depends on what you are going for as to what you should choose.</li>
            <li> I could never do that with a chemical dye, once a month re-dying my whole head.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to do my whole head.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> But since I&#x27;m doing my whole head this time to make it all match, I&#x27;ll probably use a whole packet at one time.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> /&gt;It really smells, but it works so well that I really cannot be bothered to complain about it.</li>
            <li> The color is far more intense than you&#x27;d expect from some yellow dirt.</li>
            <li> they say you have to use the whole packet.</li>
            <li> I was really</li>
            <li> The dye came in 3.5 oz, which is twice as much as store bought henna</li>
            <li> I have been dying my hair for years with chemical dyes and bleaches, so much so my hair broke off</li>
            <li> I imagine as I get used to doing it I wont need to use so much.</li>
            <li> Fast shipment.</li>
            <li> To much work for me.</li>
            <li> I will be ordering again really soon.</li>
            <li> Thanks Henna Guys.</li>
            <li> highly reccommended!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really like having to sleep for a month with a plastic bag on my head.</li>
            <li> Went to bed with my hair wet and not even one mark on my pillowcase :).</li>
            <li> have very damaged (bleach queen)</li>
            <li> Helps my processed bleached hair feel soft again and evens out my tones from too many colors in the last year.</li>
            <li> I liked being red and wanted a natural look, so I ordered some caca rouge from lush.</li>
            <li> I have naturally extremely thick hair and although I&#x27;m fair with freckles</li>
            <li> I loved the color that developed after a few washes.</li>
            <li> Keeping my head down, I used my hands to spread the goop all into my hair, making sure to get the roots first and foremost.</li>
            <li> The instructions on this package also say to leave it in for only 2-3 hrs, which is significantly shorter than you should leave in pure henna.</li>
            <li> Henna fades to a more natural color where a chemical dye will lose the color entirely becoming dull with no luster.  </li>
            <li> However, there isn&#x27;t a lot of rich red in it likening had hoped.</li>
            <li> On color alone I can already say it&#x27;s better than box dyes, but there are some other advantages as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other then that I love my hair now</li>
            <li> Wear something you don&#x27;t mind getting stained when you apply and be VERY careful for a day or two afterwards, to make sure all the orange is out, or you will stain your clothes/towels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Amazing long lasting color.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It should be noted that I think if you have hair that comes to your shoulder or longer, you are probably going to need more henna than the one package as I barely had enough to cover my hair.</li>
            <li> I would say, if you have really blond hair (which parts of my hair were), or have dyed your hair with chemicals... do not be surprised if your hair turns orange the first time you use</li>
            <li> I would say, if you have really blond hair (which parts of my hair were), or have dyed your hair with chemicals... do not be surprised if your hair turns orange the first time you use</li>
            <li> I tried oil treatments and leave in conditioners, but they didn&#x27;t do much and mostly just made my hair look oily and weighed it down.</li>
            <li> I originally wanted to mix two separate sets of henna so my blond roots would match the rest of my hair, but I&#x27;m lazy and figured it would be fine, so I applied it as close to my roots as a could and covered the length of my hair.</li>
            <li> any event, I want to be fair and retry this stuff a few more times because I find myself oddly addicted to the fun I have mixing it and the fact that it smells like nature, even if I didn&#x27;t get the desired color.</li>
            <li> And it doesn&#x27;t smell anywhere near as strongly, I added a couple of drops of essential oils to it when mixing with water</li>
            <li> An easy, natural red hair dye.</li>
            <li> The color may change just a tad since this is the first day of applying, but as long as it&#x27;s red, I am in love.</li>
            <li> as far as I can tell what they sent is the same product as last time, which I liked.</li>
            <li> I am a first time user of henna and I was pleasantly surprised with the results.</li>
            <li> The first time I used henna my hair was extremely dry afterward and didn&#x27;t feel as healthy as it had prior to using henna.  </li>
            <li> I was very worried after I ordered it, and did a little bit more research.</li>
            <li> I dye my hair a LOT and was ready to try something new that wouldn&#x27;t kill my hair this time.</li>
            <li> and then I conditioned my hair (to be on the safe side because I had previously bleached my hair in an attempt to strip some of the chemicals from my hair).</li>
            <li> (sides are about an inch and a half and top is about five inches)</li>
            <li> This formula left my hair the most vibrant shade of red</li>
            <li> Google led me to consider henna, and that led me to looking up reviews of this particular brand and color on Amazon.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m so glad I get to keep my deep red and</li>
            <li> It came out an extremely vibrant purple/red that lasted for a week.</li>
            <li> Let me tell you, the color came out super red!</li>
            <li> and i had to cut it super short and gave up dying it,</li>
            <li> I have super short hair</li>
            <li> I am giving this product three stars mainly because I contacted the Henna Guys with questions about the product on the day that I was going to apply it to my hair.</li>
            <li> If you have blonde hair I would imagine the color would turn out a more vibrant red.</li>
            <li> but it will definitely be a very pretty natural-looking red.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t the mess or smell so much better for your hair</li>
            <li> i left it on for 3 hours and got a beautiful color from it, though i know it will darken over the next few days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to lie, the pink is pretty, but I&#x27;m not ready for that kind of commitment.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While I was shopping and decided to try this henna, I also purchased another brand that bragged about its astoundingly high lawsone content (that&#x27;s the part of henna that does the dying).</li>
            <li> highly recommend The Henna Guys.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This was my original review:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used all sorts of henna on my hair, and have found that on my natural African-American hair it created a variation in color that only I could notice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to keeping a vibrant, consistent color for much longer with Rainbow brand, and when it does fade, it&#x27;s much more subtle and pleasant-looking.</li>
            <li> I read up on henna and decided I would give it a try (the prospect of it repairing my hair even a little bit was appealing).</li>
            <li> And that its all natural!!  </li>
            <li> I am an avid henna user, I dye my hair with regular pure henna about every 3 months.</li>
            <li> I ruined a couple of light shirts because my hair would still be wet and it would stain my clothing.</li>
            <li> This is by far the easiest to use among those I&#x27;ve tried because it is also so much finer.</li>
            <li> It is not 100% henna, but it is 100% natural and that is all that really matters to me.</li>
            <li> but i dont like my natural color much and</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll stick to my natural hair rather than dye my whole house orange</li>
            <li> I mixed my henna with hibiscus tea and some fresh lemon juice.</li>
            <li> If you have blond or gray hair, the result will be more reddish orange than deep red wine at first, and you might want to try a different shade.</li>
            <li> The Henna took pretty well my first use but only dyed the lighter/pre-bleached portions of my hair and did not take to my natural roots at all.</li>
            <li> I simply mixed it with warm water, grapefruit essential oil, and the henna and left it on for 4 and 1/2 hours.</li>
            <li> if  you don&#x27;t care about bleeding and paying double shipping its worth to get it.</li>
            <li> I am allergic to almost everything, and I had no negative reaction to this.</li>
            <li> It was fun to do (a bit messy but life is short people, enjoy the journey!)</li>
            <li> way healthier than any time i used normal dyes.  </li>
            <li> I discovered my hair was bleeding orange in the shower, and with a few more showers after that, I realized the color was gradually fading.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I mixed the henna with a spice tea water and fresh lemon juice.</li>
            <li> I thought it would make my hair permanently red because every time I dye my hair something other than red, I tell myself that I&#x27;m gonna run back to red because it works best for my skin tone</li>
            <li> Beats the strong ammonia and chemical smell from conventional hair dye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I applied this brand of henna a second time around late November, same color and amount with a little more added ingredients, I was more satisfied with the result.</li>
            <li> I mixed it with strongly brewed hibiscus tea in hopes of amping the red and added about 10 drops of lavender oil for the smell.</li>
            <li> It was still bleeding after at least 50 rinses and a good soaking, very light yellow like urine, but I dried it and will follow up in 48 hours with a wash.</li>
            <li> There was some red in my water as I washed but the overall color seems fine.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for the second time but the my first time from this particular company.  </li>
            <li> it still smells somewhat, but i&#x27;ll live.  </li>
            <li> I have (had, ugh) light blonde hair and decided to try out the red with this henna dye.</li>
            <li> I had some shipment problem  because USPS and they solved it with very professional manner even though it was not their fault.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to anyone wanting to use a natural, non-toxic hair dye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It turns my hair a beautiful deep burgundy, with my few grays a deep copper red.</li>
            <li> : Is now a subtle, yet beautiful deep red when the sun hits it.</li>
            <li> Now while I (and apparently half the people here) think my orange hair is really freaking cool, it was not the result</li>
            <li> Now while I (and apparently half the people here) think my orange hair is really freaking cool, it was not the result</li>
            <li> They only thing I didn&#x27;t really like about this product is that it bleeds a lot!</li>
            <li> I will wait another 24 hours (it has been exactly 24 since I washed the dye out) to see what the actual color will be.</li>
            <li> first photo is very similar to the shade of my hair before using the henna.</li>
            <li> My first time was with regular henna from The Henna Guys.</li>
            <li> If you want healthy hair in a different color, check out all the Henna Guys&#x27; other colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> its does stink and color was not as vivid as i was hoping it would be</li>
            <li> I used hot water, cinnamon, and a cup of water that I steeped 2 teabags of passion tea and 2 bags of chamomile tea into to help intensify the red.</li>
            <li> decided to order a pack of Deep Red henna, because I absolutely LOVE red hair on me.</li>
            <li> But I found a bunch of pictures on the internet from people who have used red henna and it seemed to turn out very well for others!</li>
            <li> My first purchase from your company arrived last Friday.</li>
            <li> you are switching to henna from commercial hair dye, it takes some effort at first.  </li>
            <li> As a first time user of the product I will say I will never go back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a natural light blonde that died my hair red at a salon once before using this product.</li>
            <li> Not only that, but due to the hibiscus powder, it started out looking almost black, but with strong, gorgeous purple and red highlights that bring me compliments even 2 months later.</li>
            <li> The henna gave my hair a really lovely dark red.</li>
            <li> For 5 years I&#x27;ve been using a well known semi-permanent color of dark burgundy red which I love colorwise.</li>
            <li> I have virgin naturally wavy, mixed raced hair, and because of this, the color took very well!</li>
            <li> However, it took forever to complete the first rinse and my hair continues to bleed out well over a week later.  </li>
            <li> The color came out extremely pigmented, but pretty orange, since it was pure henna.</li>
            <li> My original hair color is a dark auburn brown.</li>
            <li> and it made my hair look all one rich dark color.</li>
            <li> The color was phenomenal but the only issue is that my hair bled for a month and a half.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve dyed my hair with regular dyes from regular super markets for years.</li>
            <li> The color is very vibrant, but not quiet as &amp;#34;Ariel Red&amp;#34; as pictured in the circle on the package.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It took half the day to mix, apply washout mix apply washout,but it was sooooo worth it!</li>
            <li> My virgin roots match the dyed areas and the whole head is more uniform, though the previous splotchiness could have been due to my henna newb status.</li>
            <li> Prior to trying the Deep/Dark Red from the Henna Guys, I was using a different brand, which I liked, but was more expensive.</li>
            <li> The directions on the packet were clear, and I followed them to the letter.  </li>
            <li> Be on the lookout for my next order very soon.</li>
            <li> , I actually didn&#x27;t use the whole packet</li>
            <li> This is by far the richest color I have ever had.</li>
            <li> No one told met that henna is almost completely irreversible and nothing will take it out.</li>
            <li> My friend recommended me to use Henna, and told me it was natural and wouldn&#x27;t hurt your hair.</li>
            <li> And WOW.</li>
            <li> My hair is above my shoulders and I had to use the whole package.</li>
            <li> Way more of a purple red than an orange red than I expected.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel soft and rejuvenated after washing it out</li>
            <li> It completely ruined my carpet.</li>
            <li> I was initially really put off by the color and tried to fade it as much as possible.  </li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll need some old clothes and towels because it stains, I slept with a towel over my pillow&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> My hair ruined everything white in our hotel room for the whole week we were there.</li>
            <li> (My natural hair color is a medium brown)</li>
            <li> In all my years I have NEVER felt my hair THAT soft.</li>
            <li> It was still soft.</li>
            <li> Baby soft hair!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised though.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After all of these years, I would never ever have believed that there was a substance that could make MY hair THIS soft.</li>
            <li> It looks really natural.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally oily and when I use henna it takes longer for my hair to feel or look like it has oil in it.</li>
            <li> I tried different colors and all of them worked very well.</li>
            <li> It also took the whole amout of product to cover my short hair.</li>
            <li> Much healthier hair, would never go back to chemical color.  </li>
            <li> My hair now feels soft luscious and thicker.</li>
            <li> Also, the product said that henna was a natural conditioner.  </li>
            <li> My hair came out feeling like straw and completely unmanageable.  </li>
            <li> I would rather pay a professional.</li>
            <li> I saw online that people recommend using a red berry tea and that worked really well for me.</li>
            <li> i mixed it to a mash potato consistency, covered it with plastic wrap, and went to work, because i read online that you needed to let henna sit for 12 hours to be ready to use.  </li>
            <li> You mix it with just water, and you apparently don&#x27;t need to let the henna oxidize like you would normally, according to the instructions.</li>
            <li> (buy cheap conditioner for this process you will need it) and then blow dried it</li>
            <li> The color nearly matches the stock photo color, which I was surprised about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , if you have naturally curled hair - this WILL relax your curls a bit.</li>
            <li> hair feels soft and looks shiny.</li>
            <li> Instead, I have an intense red with wine highlights.  </li>
            <li> However, this company offers lots of colors to choose from.  </li>
            <li> Before applying the henna I rinsed my hair with an apple cider vinegar and water mixture to naturally strip it of oils.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m assuming the people complaining of color running didn&#x27;t rinse the henna out completely.</li>
            <li> I wrapped it in cling wrap and slept with it on, so I had it on for at least 8 hours or more before I rinsed it out.</li>
            <li> Maybe it was my mix of two hennas or my very fragrant red tea</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is so easy to use, and it actually takes me less henna using Henna Guys to do a full head application, then any other brand.</li>
            <li> you know anything about henna, real 100% pure henna does not come in any other color than red/red-orange/red-brown.</li>
            <li> I gave up after two bleaches because it was just getting to be too hard to go from one end of the spectrum to the other without paying a good chunk of money at the salon to have them do</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was not aware that I would have to reapply the henna more than once to get the deep red shade I want.</li>
            <li> /&gt;To make a long story short, if you want healthy red hair and want to be properly rewarded for all the work and time that applying henna requires, BUY THIS HENNA!</li>
            <li> Use a bunch of wet paper towels to clean up any spillage you have while applying because no matter how care you are, it will inevitably get on the floor and on yourself.</li>
            <li> hair feels super soft, even the ends which were slightly</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous trying it at first, because it is really permanent and you can&#x27;t change it with chemical dye if you end up not liking it</li>
            <li> I thought this rinsed easier than the previous henna had and the final color is darker yet has more red tones.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to dye my hair a vibrant red for years.</li>
            <li> I left it on over night (about 7 hours) but prior to applying it I let the mix (henna, hibiscus, honey,acv, cinnamon, tresseme conditioner, oils, and hot boiling water) sit over night.</li>
            <li> First application left my roots the desired red and everything else orange, some spots were even a blackish color...</li>
            <li> Also, the results stayed vibrant for only about five days before the color started fading dramatically.</li>
            <li> and I must say that this henna was high quality henna and is the only brand that I will be using from here on out.</li>
            <li> 3 hours later I am a deep red color exactly what I was going for!</li>
            <li> far as the color is concerned, I really wasn&#x27;t expecting deep red.</li>
            <li> I DID get some orange stains on my forehead but after washing my face it went away almost completely and was barely visible, but still visible.</li>
            <li> Still dark but with rich red tones.</li>
            <li> Even some reviewers with virgin hair are reporting the bleeding and acting like that is normal for henna dyes.</li>
            <li> when i got back, i added a little more vinegar, hot water, and a little almond oil to get it to a yogurt consistency</li>
            <li> When I first applied it (I got the color Auburn), the result came out SUPER firetruck red (I&#x27;m a natural blonde, and my hair was a little red from the previous dye job)-- which I read was pretty normal.</li>
            <li> I was also a bit put off about having to let the henna sit in my hair for hours, rather than just the quick 25 minutes with chemical dyes, but it wasn&#x27;t a problem you can make the henna thick like a past and then put it all up in a shower cap, and go about your business, its like using a hair mask :)</li>
            <li> I had previously dyed it (to many times) trying to get a deep red and last week used a competitors henna that had sort of reddened it to what I wanted but was orange in some areas.</li>
            <li> the exact color I want without the harsh effects or smell of normal hair dye.</li>
            <li> any event, I want to be fair and retry this stuff a few more times because I find myself oddly addicted to the fun I have mixing it and the fact that it smells like nature, even if I didn&#x27;t get the desired color.me the wrong package for how orange my hair was.</li>
            <li> The application was super messy and I had to have someone help me.</li>
            <li> The instructions are very clear and simple.</li>
            <li> I was absolutely blown away by how much it repaired my damaged, dry hair (again), and how VIBRANT the color came out on my dark brown hair!</li>
            <li> It also covered my greys and made them a pretty ruby color where the other made them orange.</li>
            <li> I thought this would only work on light colored hair, but it worked really well on my dark brown, previously dyed, hair.</li>
            <li> I read a lot of online tutorials about henna in general, to get some pointers because this stuff is somewhat of an undertaking.  </li>
            <li> Apparently henna darkens over 48 hours after dying because it doesn&#x27;t have the additives that speed up the coloring process.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really wanted to finish what I had left, but I eventually gave in and bought the Deep Red color from the Henna Guys.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve made up my mind to go as natural as I possibly can when it comes to hair products.</li>
            <li> I wanted to maintain red hair without using pharmacy box dyes, even if they contain no ammonia like Natural Instincts.</li>
            <li> already had red in the ends of my hair, but it seems to have blended almost seamlessly with my roots.</li>
            <li> Remember that red hair dye no matter if it&#x27;s synthetic or natural, will always come out the quickest.</li>
            <li> and when I looked at my hair, the red had faded considerable amount.</li>
            <li> , I go to Lush at the mall and got a cacao red to brown it up at bit.</li>
            <li> Shipping arrived much faster than expected.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally brown hair and the color turned out a deep burgundy.</li>
            <li> And anyone that tells you that it was, isn&#x27;t washing out their normal hair dye enough as it is, or they&#x27;re not mixing the henna well enough.</li>
            <li> I had to deep condition to get my hair back to normal.  </li>
            <li> Nice way to skip the chemicaly expensive trips to Sally&#x27;s beauty for me and do my stuff at home without a hitch.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I did a little more research online, so this was my procedure: 1 and a half cups purified water for 100 grams of product and 1/4 organic lemon juice (or the juice of 2 organic lemons).</li>
            <li> After a few moments I took it down and touched the top of my head.</li>
            <li> anyone knows how long i can wait before I dye it again with regular dye or if I could bleach over it and revert back to my chemical hair dye that&#x27;d be great.&lt;br /&gt;Overall extremely disappointed, especially since I paid a lot more than normal for something I thought would be more beneficial for me.</li>
            <li> I thought the beautiful dark red color would stay at least a little better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This brand was my first ever henna application on previously chemically dyed hair.</li>
            <li> The dark red gives absolutely gorgeous color for the first 2 weeks but has been leaching out with every wash like crazy</li>
            <li> the package says it will tone down in the next few days, and i certainly hope so, because i&#x27;m not sure my boss will be thrilled.  </li>
            <li> The texture makes it easy to cover all your hair with less henna and means less clumps of</li>
            <li> Well when I first mixed the henna with water it was a dark burnt orange color</li>
            <li> I tried this henna after using Lush&#x27;s red henna bricks, and chemical dyes prior to that.</li>
            <li> It will not make you look like a natural red head on any level, but at the same time it is not overly unnatural.</li>
            <li> I left it in for a good 3 hours and rinsed out with cold water as directed.</li>
            <li> A little orange on the first dye....</li>
            <li> (specially if you have thick, curl/ wavy, ethnic  hair, like myself).c  hair, like myself).</li>
            <li> My hair has been dyed in the past so it did not come out as super red as it did on my roots.</li>
            <li> However,  due to me having the extremely damaged hair, it faded quick</li>
            <li> It darkened my already dark brown hair kind of like dark red lipstick that is almost black.</li>
            <li> I had previously done my research and did NOT follow the instructions that came with the product because I wanted a very vibrant color.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li> It stunk to high heaven, so much so that I could hardly tolerate it.</li>
            <li> This is definitely my favorite color to choose but be aware that red is very difficult to cover if you decide to change back to a brown henna!</li>
            <li> Left stains on my pillow cases and towels every time i got my hair wet, if you are a first time henna user (they don&#x27;t tell you this on here of course) but you need to apply it twice for it to go red, and if you have long hair</li>
            <li> I originally have dark brown hair and it turned my hair dark red</li>
            <li> so I have enough left for a whole other treatment.</li>
            <li> It was very dark red the first</li>
            <li> So, if you have dark hair, don&#x27;t expect the intense fiery red you see in their models, but</li>
            <li> I have had Henna for my hair for a long time now, and had previously been pretty faithful to another web retailer, until now.</li>
            <li> To me, the fantastic color this left was not worth the trouble of having bleeding red hair.</li>
            <li> I had used pure henna a few years ago on chemically-treated hair with permanent results that didn&#x27;t bleed.</li>
            <li> This might be *slightly* cheaper, but it&#x27;s worth the few extra dollars to buy Rainbow henna directly from [...] , or here on Amazon or Puritan&#x27;s Pride.</li>
            <li> Okay, so my hair was half black (front), half red (back).</li>
            <li> I decided to try this out because I was sick of my hair being two-tone (brown inside and red in the sun), so this seemed like a good idea.</li>
            <li> I ordered the deep red, from their picture it was more of the color I have been trying to obtain, but no luck this came out worse than any other henna I have tried.</li>
            <li> The description says it will not change the color or your darker hair, but unless you have stark black hair, this usually isn&#x27;t true, so I went with it.</li>
            <li> THE COLOR JUST RAN OUT FROM MY HAIR DOWN MY BACK AND SHOULDER INTO MY NEW SWIM SUIT &amp; INTO THE WATER.  </li>
            <li> Rinse as much out as you can with plain water and then work the conditioner in from root to tip to help the grains slip out of your hair.</li>
            <li> Adding flour created many lumps which I tried very hard to beat out by using a potato masher, but in the end I gave up and decided to use it on my hair the way it was by that point, remaining lumps and all.&lt;br /&gt;I flipped my hair upside down and stuck my head into the bowl.</li>
            <li> hair,(my first x using henna,I needed something natural bcz last few times I used Chemical dye half of it fell out!</li>
            <li> The color is essentially the same, so I&#x27;d say as long as it&#x27;s a lighter shade of red than what they&#x27;ve provided that you&#x27;re ok.&lt;br /&gt;»On</li>
            <li> I have shoulder-length  hair when straight, just past my ears curly, and this was just enough for one use.</li>
            <li> Semi-permanent dye for caucasian hair worked for a while, but still left my hair dry and brittle; not to mention that the color was dramatically different on the now white roots than the rest of the hair.</li>
            <li> That has not been my experience with pure henna in the past.</li>
            <li> Rinsing out: The first time I did this, I did as directed and had a hard time getting the mask out of my hair.  </li>
            <li> Just a faint hint left, my hair products easily covers that up.</li>
            <li> Permanent hair dye left my hair unhealthy and faded quickly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found it no harder to apply than regular hair dye, and I even missed the same places that I typically do when using commercial dyes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing it was because my hair is so dark and all of it was natural.</li>
            <li> : After reading the strange blacked out instruction sheet, I looked at the actual package of henna.</li>
            <li> the color didn&#x27;t last long in my hair, now my hair is reddish brown.</li>
            <li> this henna is long lasting.</li>
            <li> did not last as long as splat</li>
            <li> At first it looks a little purple (on dark hair)</li>
            <li> HOWever, remember you can&#x27;t use anything other product on your hair, no other dye but henna, and no perms...</li>
            <li> What I came out with is a very dark but very noticeable pink.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t dry out my hair, it definitely improved it by making it softer and skinnier.</li>
            <li> the bleach made my hair dry and fragile.</li>
            <li> not sure if it&#x27;s an error on my part or if it&#x27;s the brand&#x27;s fault or simply if this is normal, but the color fades with each shower I take.</li>
            <li> My hair is super thin and flimsy and tangles when the wind blows.</li>
            <li> This was the first time I have colored my hair with Henna, I have very dry, damaged hair from previous colored products ( dark brown ) and thought what do I have to lose.</li>
            <li> This product is henna and crushed hibiscus flowers, you can always soak your hair in hibiscus tea to boost the natural red tint of your hair; just don&#x27;t buy this product thinking it&#x27;s going to stay in your hair like black box dye.</li>
            <li> I even mixed some indigo in it to make it a little darker and it became a deep red.</li>
            <li> I have dark 1b African American nappy</li>
            <li> The henna would quit bleeding afterthe second shampoo, and the stains on my hands were minimal.</li>
            <li> minor problem</li>
            <li> I have lived the past 16 years accepting that i will grow old and grey with honor.until last friday when i got my hair done for a whopping $170 to come yet again home and want to cry.</li>
            <li> Plus, after a long time in the shower, my hair still wasn&#x27;t rinsing clear.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Also, my hair is the shiniest/softest it has been in a long time.</li>
            <li> It will turn white towels orange after it gets wet.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a long process, so I suggest having a shower session dedicated to nothing but your hair</li>
            <li> As far as it being messy, what hair dye isn&#x27;t?</li>
            <li> I would take hour long cold/warm showers at the hotel trying to rinse it all out, sometimes even 2 or 3 times a day.</li>
            <li> Leave it on as long as you can.  </li>
            <li> more messy, and difficult to apply than regular hair dye.&lt;br /&gt;»I</li>
            <li> It took a long time to rinse.</li>
            <li> The process for dying the hair was to long.</li>
            <li> i have long, strawberry blond hair, so i separated it into sections, and got my boyfriend to help me.  </li>
            <li> after my hair dried, it was so soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li> Does not stay in hair for long and takes for even to process.</li>
            <li> The color lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> For the first time ever, my hair was completely covered all the way to the roots, including that terribly difficult area around the hairline.</li>
            <li> have maybe 3-4 inch long hair and used 100G, so I used WAY to much, but I also have thick hair.</li>
            <li> Henna can be difficult to apply but the benefits are so very worth it.</li>
            <li> I previously dyed my hair red (and still would like my hair to be red).</li>
            <li> I went natural about four years ago and found that permanent hair dye was too harsh for my dry hair.  </li>
            <li> if you like subtle, almost natural looking deep red, then yes.</li>
            <li> It left a barely detectable, dingiest of yellow stain on my roots, seemed to dull the color of my previously applied henna on the rest, and no bleeding past the first shampoo.</li>
            <li> And same result as with the other henna...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a couple of other red hennas.</li>
            <li> One packet usually is enough to color my waist length head of hair, but maybe other people have thicker hair (mine is medium/thick hair).</li>
            <li> I had a lot of gray and had stopped using chemical hair dyes sometime ago due to obvious health risks involved when using chemical hair dyes products.  </li>
            <li> I am also giving this product three stars because I still had little to no color after the second application, even after subsituting water for red zinger tea which is suppose to deepen the tone of the color.</li>
            <li> You know who you are, the ones who constantly have people call your hair black only to grumble back \\&quot;its dark BROWN\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I have very long hair below my shoulders.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t leave it on very long because it was also spread onto my skin, and I was concerned about staining.  </li>
            <li> the henna can leave the hair a lil dry for a couple days.</li>
            <li> and letting it air dry.</li>
            <li> so I could see what it looked like dry.</li>
            <li> even with my hair dry</li>
            <li> Not a red that could be seen as a pink, but obviously pink.</li>
            <li> the goop out wasn&#x27;t so bad, definitely not as bad as rinsing out henna hair dye from Lush!</li>
            <li> A far cry when using the chemical hair dyes in the past.  </li>
            <li> After no success at fading it myself, a week or two later  it settled into the color I had hoped it would.</li>
            <li> My hair looked like it was peeing a dehydrated persons dark yellow pee for weeks.</li>
            <li> The only down side was the henna continued to bleed every time I washed my hair.  </li>
            <li> (I left it on for a little too long, and it&#x27;s darker than anticipated.</li>
            <li> THE SAME &amp; HAS RUINED MORE THAN MY NEW SWIMSUIT, TOWELS AND PJ&#x27;S.  STILL A VERY BAD EXPERIENCE, NEVER HAS HAPPENED USING OTHER HENNA PRODUCTS.</li>
            <li> and I went to Black Widow RED!</li>
            <li> Over a few days, it darkened to a nicer, darker cherry color; however, it didn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> I have fairly short hair and used about half of the henna (~50g).</li>
            <li> By doing this I get the mask out much easier and less likely to leave bits behind.</li>
            <li> /&gt;they have finally subsided (although my nails are still orange, but nothing that a little nail polish wont cover up).</li>
            <li> I have been hannaing my hair for a little over a year now and have tried 5 different brands (I want it redder than what I keep getting)</li>
            <li> I have a little longer than shoulder length hair and only used about 50 grams</li>
            <li> Now I do it a little differently.</li>
            <li> It rinsed about the same as every other henna I have had, which for the record, is not a quick process.</li>
            <li> I have had to strip my hair, bleach it three times, and dye it twice just to get it back to an ugly greenish light brown color.</li>
            <li> The henna process is MESSY but this was my 2nd time applying it</li>
            <li> The others were so clumpy and harder to mix.</li>
            <li> , I mixed it with green tea, olive oil, apple cider vinegar and lavender oil, leave it on my kitchen counter overnight and the apply in the morning</li>
            <li> I know they say that these color are not good for darker hair types (which I find ridiculous seeing as it&#x27;s henna, which was discovered my Indians and most of them have dark brown to black hair, but w/e).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never go back to harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> If you want your hair to be red, not fade and not be dead, buy this stuff immediately.  </li>
            <li> Your hair will bleed yellow water for a few days</li>
            <li> I then carefully applied the pudding-like mixture to my hair and let it sit for once again, 4 hours.</li>
            <li> It immediately turned to clumps of wet grass on my hair.</li>
            <li> They also had a wide range of shades to choose from.</li>
            <li> but it leaked every time it got wet</li>
            <li> I even tried to get a refund and stop the transaction, but the henna arrived at my house a few hours later so not much could be done.</li>
            <li> so it would be pasty enough to apply, but thick enough so it didn&#x27;t run everywhere.  </li>
            <li> When I removed it, I slowly re-melted it with steam and applied it directly to my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair comes down to my brastrap and is pretty thin.</li>
            <li> Also, my hair came out much brassier, less pigmented, and dryer, which was a pretty bad combination.</li>
            <li> I typically leave it in for 3 hours only as I don&#x27;t want it too dark.</li>
            <li> The other company i was with before only had a few colors.</li>
            <li> My previous color was a brown/red with lots of grey.  </li>
            <li> My brown hair turned red, and my black hair remained black with a brown-red hue in sunlight.  </li>
            <li> I was questionable on whether I wanted to try this color of red because it looked too vibrant for me.</li>
            <li> Henna powder keeps as long as you put it in an air tight container or bag and store it in a cabinet.  </li>
            <li> When I melted it, I used boiling dark red tea and mixed slowly with the caca rouge and other henna together.</li>
            <li> After 2 months, there&#x27;s very minimal orange bleed, and while the color is less deep and less purple, it STILL doesn&#x27;t look brassy.</li>
            <li> After 2 months, there&#x27;s very minimal orange bleed, and while the color is less deep and less purple, it STILL doesn&#x27;t look brassy.</li>
            <li> I purchased Henna Guys Deep Red hoping my hair (which is either the darkest brown or the lightest black) would at least become an auburn color.</li>
            <li> Rough your hands carefully through your hair so that the water can get down to your scalp, and it should all come out effortlessly in that</li>
            <li> I would be embarrassed by the orange stains on my hands, but found that if I did a lot of dishes after hennaing my hair, about half of the stain would go away and the rest would fade after the next few days.</li>
            <li> It turned my green hair (from a previous dye job) orange, which faded to blonde after two washes and a week.</li>
            <li> Even to this day, about a week and a half later, I still have trouble brushing/combing through my hair.</li>
            <li> Wish I had gone with this first, but I was skeptical.</li>
            <li> so it was extremely damaged.</li>
            <li> and there are other plant powders in it that are supposed to be beneficial to hair.</li>
            <li> I could tell immediately when I mixed it up and got a small amount on my thumb that wearing gloves during application was going to be mandatory.</li>
            <li> i could have just bought the box at walgreens like usual and could have had the same outcome</li>
            <li> I PURCHASED THIS FROM &amp;#34;THE HENNA GUYS&amp;#34; I ALWAYS USE HENNA TO COLOR THE FEW GREY HAIRS, BUT THIS PRODUCT WAS A NIGHTMARE.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Normally with other brands, I would do an oil pre-treatment before applying the henna or I would add oil to the henna itself.</li>
            <li> When I first started I used really expensive body art quality henna.  </li>
            <li> All it did was leave a small red tint to my hair and dyed all of my belongings.</li>
            <li> My hair now is a deep purple, subtle and not loud...</li>
            <li> Itsba great product looks a little nasty wen its all put together</li>
            <li> The color did not last and the application process got a little messy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was definitely anxious and afraid of the outcome but so far it&#x27;s very close to the color that I want.</li>
            <li> No damage, weird color changes, etc happened because like the package says, this is 100% pure henna.</li>
            <li> Dye release is immediate, which is convenient but oddly unlike other henna dyes.</li>
            <li> I even mixed in some olive oil and used orange spice tea instead of hot water to combat the smell (which isn&#x27;t that bad) and added cinnamon and paprika to bring out highlights.</li>
            <li> I have never before dyed my hair  with henna before, and so I was a bit in the dark when I ordered this.</li>
            <li> I have medium to dark brown hair with 10 percent gray.  </li>
            <li> for dark brunettes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been told that this henna won&#x27;t work on dark brown hair, but decided to give it a try anyway.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t dramatically change my dark brown hair</li>
            <li> My hair is a dark brown</li>
            <li> I probably stained at least 30 towels and countless pillow cases.</li>
            <li> I have naturally dark brown hair</li>
            <li> My hair is long, past my bra strap.  </li>
            <li> After attempting to go platinum blond from dark brown</li>
            <li> The three packets I got will last me for at least a year.  </li>
            <li> When I dyed it late November for the second time, it was a dark cherry color; now, it&#x27;s a duller, copper-y red/orange/brown shade.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure how to rank this product.</li>
            <li> there is orange sweat coming down to my face  </li>
            <li> which means that every time I sweated or went swimming - you guessed it, I had rivulets of orange dripping down my neck and face.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mean ginger red or a strawberry blond/red..</li>
            <li> i put a black towel down and got in the bathtub.  </li>
            <li> For a few days after,  your hair may feel a little rough</li>
            <li> (even after conditioning and oiling it up it took me an hour to do a half assed job).</li>
            <li> I have a friend waiting to see my opinion on this vs the previous henna</li>
            <li> I then put the included plastic shower cap over my head, wrapped a towel turban-style over THAT, and watched Netflix for two and a half hours.&lt;br /&gt;Rinsing</li>
            <li> almost black hair</li>
            <li> The front (chemically dyed black)</li>
            <li> I held it under a lamp to read what they tried to black out.</li>
            <li> No worries though cos it doesn&#x27;t stain like typical hair dye from the drugstore.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a subtle auburn red and do not want to wait for it to fade, then you should probably try something else.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Henna &amp; indigo 2 step for jet black</li>
            <li> I use about half a pack.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been coloring my hair for seven years with chemical dyes, and in less then three days this convinced me to never do so</li>
            <li> in a black washcloth, towel, and pillowcase.&lt;br /&gt;»Use tea to scent the water!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I left it on for 5 hours and my hair remained all sorts of weird orange and red colors.</li>
            <li> I have previously used Henna on my hair, but it was Jamila Henna body art quality.</li>
            <li> and it went away in less than a day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of the few that doesn&#x27;t make my hair way too dark.</li>
            <li> my hair is very dark almost black.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little grittier than some though.</li>
            <li> I find myself still washing out little sand particles.</li>
            <li> : I ordered again - a little put off by the changes in the shipment.</li>
            <li> Maybe got a little bit on my arm and ear</li>
            <li> and I was a little concerned and hesitant as I don&#x27;t care for that color at all with my skin tone.</li>
            <li> and I even had it dyed a little darker and</li>
            <li> You may need to add a little water as you go to keep it moist.  </li>
            <li> little, but it&#x27;s nothing that you can&#x27;tcombat with body sprays, perfume oils,</li>
            <li> A little pricey</li>
            <li> The thing is, from the looks of things, caca rouge was a little too ginger-y for my taste</li>
            <li> i put a black towel behind my head, cuz some \\&quot;mud\\&quot; will inevitably escape, and i didn&#x27;t want to stain anything.  </li>
            <li> As I have very thick hair, I needed the entire 100 grams.</li>
            <li> Now that I have enough hair (about pixie cut length, virgin hair, dirty blonde), I was having the urge to color it, but I didn&#x27;t want to ruin it with chemicals.</li>
            <li> I have blonde highlights and they came out orange so do not use on blonde or dirty blonde hair because parts of my hair are natuarally dirty blonde and the color came out orange...</li>
            <li> My hair was growing out from the Jamila when I ordered this, so my roots were several inches of dirty blonde, with the rest being a coppery</li>
            <li> quite disappointing, really...</li>
            <li> still messy tho</li>
            <li> It has none of the metals that will turn your hair green or make it melt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , god knows I&#x27;ve wasted  before, i couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s messy, it&#x27;s time consuming</li>
            <li> It still looks like I have some spots missing too...</li>
            <li> The smell is almost an earthy green tea, didn&#x27;t linger like I thought it would either.</li>
            <li> no longer have to come in contact with harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> I still see a few grays</li>
            <li> Even worse 6 weeks after the treatment my daughter said it looked like I died my hair with pee in front of several people at a gathering,  </li>
            <li> and it was a messy process...</li>
            <li> You may have to do it a few times in a row at the beginning</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t get it all out, of course it&#x27;s going to feel like straw, you&#x27;ve still got dried powder on your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;►</li>
            <li> But anyone who has used henna before knows that the color changes over a few days and washings.</li>
            <li> but it goes away after a few washes.</li>
            <li> I used vasaline around my hairline and my forehead to prevent any harsh staining.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s MESSY when you wash it out.</li>
            <li> Made my hair feel heavy for days and it really dried it out.</li>
            <li> I feel like I&#x27;m missing something here...</li>
            <li> A mix between green tea and hay.</li>
            <li> This was over a few months ago</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s messy.</li>
            <li> But unlike the other reviews I&#x27;ve read online,henna really doesn&#x27;t smell bad at all.</li>
            <li> Even if you aren&#x27;t crazy about the way the color comes out on you (results vary due to natural hair color, virgin  vs treated hair, etc) the health benefits of the henna will make you grateful</li>
            <li> Even if you aren&#x27;t crazy about the way the color comes out on you (results vary due to natural hair color, virgin  vs treated hair, etc) the health benefits of the henna will make you grateful</li>
            <li> It smells pretty bad, which I was prepared for but the smell lingered in my hair for about a week afterward despite shampooing and conditioning.</li>
            <li> As a raw vegan, I knew it was time to ditch the chemicals but was not happy with past henna results....or with the idea of embracing the grey.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After reading around, I discovered this wash out problem was generally common among people with previously chemically dyed hair.</li>
            <li> the henna for a little over 2 hours...LOVE it!</li>
            <li> a little bit of dull yellowish stain and no root coverage.</li>
            <li> I use a very little amount each time just to do the roots.  </li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t think it smelled bad at all, but perhaps that was because the grapefruit.</li>
            <li> But this was excessive.</li>
            <li> It usually took about three shampoos before it would quit bleeding from my hair.</li>
            <li> I was not terribly pleased with this henna, but ordered again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this stuff will EVERY wash out.</li>
            <li> The color isn&#x27;t like how it looks in the picture :/</li>
            <li> This henna dried out my hair to the point that I could NO LONGER BRUSH IT!</li>
            <li> It just needs to get past the not playing well with the dye that&#x27;s already on your hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> One small packet lasts months.  </li>
            <li> They sent me the missing package with a gift, and they charge me nothing!</li>
            <li> Not sure I would try it again.</li>
            <li> (I followed the directions on the package to the letter), but at this point, I&#x27;m not satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> I am not sure I will purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> I chopped the caca rouge as small as I could before melting.</li>
            <li> Very, very messy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pretty messy, but if you are prepared it isn&#x27;t anything too ridiculous.</li>
            <li> My hair - pixie cut, very thick, and dark brown at the roots.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately for me, the mix ran a little thin, so I just added regular flour until it thickened from being sauce-like into cake batter- like.</li>
            <li> My main worry after reading the horrible reviews was that my hair would constantly be bleeding, some people wrote of ruining their towels and shirts.</li>
            <li> I have tried different chemical dyes in the past; they all make my scalp itch and hurt like crazy.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After my long experience with henna, I am convinced that almost all the henna sold in the United States is very poor quality henna that would never sell in the country of origin.</li>
            <li> Followed instructions to the &#x27;t,&#x27; and wound up with dull color that ran for days.</li>
            <li> Is it hard to wash out?&lt;br /&gt;»NO.</li>
            <li> the itch to dye it hit hard and so I decided to give henna a shot.</li>
            <li> My husband (who is the king of being overly sensitive to smell) even said it didn&#x27;t smell bad.</li>
            <li> At home i started researching, after i found i was allergic to common hair dye i tried henna once</li>
            <li> Sucks too because it supposedly is supposed to make hair feel/</li>
            <li> , at least that&#x27;s what I read from research.</li>
            <li> Red likes to run, and cold water helps to prevent that.</li>
            <li> but it does have the aroma of burnt licorice candy which I don&#x27;t mind in the least bit....</li>
            <li> henna sucks to apply</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length thick curly hair.</li>
            <li> because I have really thick</li>
            <li> Smells like you&#x27;re at a natural spa, though I have to say I start to get sick of the smell after a day or so.</li>
            <li> I mean neon</li>
            <li> I was not able to remove the stains!</li>
            <li> I was disappointed to find that it didn&#x27;t make my hair as soft as the Henna Guys henna did.</li>
            <li> Seriously, this stuff is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Seriously, this stuff is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it seriously feels like spider silk.  </li>
            <li> I saw some people giving out low ratings because of this issue, but it&#x27;s not as bad as they made it out to be.</li>
            <li> I saw some people giving out low ratings because of this issue, but it&#x27;s not as bad as they made it out to be.</li>
            <li> The color did bleed for me for about 2 weeks after application, but it wasn&#x27;t THAT bad and not at all bothersome, just something I noticed, and it only bled when i washed my hair, it didn&#x27;t stain my pillow or clothing or anything like that at all.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Too bad for me because I can&#x27;t get it out all of the way even after 6 shampoos, 8 conditions and 3 deep conditions.</li>
            <li> I was sooo disappointed, and back to applying Henna Guys henna two days</li>
            <li> I was extremely scared to use this product after reading all the recent reviews, all were horrible from 2014.</li>
            <li> Also, my hair feels thick and looks shiny, even without conditioner!  </li>
            <li> so my hair is very thick.</li>
            <li> My hair is all the way to my butt, and very thick.</li>
            <li> i MIGHT be addicted to it.</li>
            <li> but it was worse than I thought and</li>
            <li> (It&#x27;s pretty awful, but the results made me turn a blind eye to it.)&lt;br /&gt;»Can</li>
            <li> Well, what a mess!!!!</li>
            <li> I was worried because of previous dyes and hennas that the color would turn out bad.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m a little disappointed there, but</li>
            <li> I have read a lot about the process and it seemed like it could be quite complicated.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There&#x27;s nothing wrong with hibiscus.</li>
            <li> I almost thought they had sent me the wrong package for how orange my hair was.</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with the product.</li>
            <li> I am completely addicted to The Henna Guys!</li>
            <li> I did not find application to be difficult -</li>
            <li> This was somewhat of an embarrassment for me because I unfortunately dyed my hair over the summer...</li>
            <li> thought my husband hated it, as it was a pretty shocking</li>
            <li> My hair turned clown ugly red and looked horrible.</li>
            <li> A lot of the reviews say that the smell is horrible and its soo messy and time consuming.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s STILL RUNNING AFTER 1 MONTH with using cold water.</li>
            <li> course it stinks.</li>
            <li> After that rinse in cold water to seal it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Cold water washing didn&#x27;t help either.</li>
            <li> Its very silly</li>
            <li> The worst thing about this henna is that it bleeds CONSTANTLY, or at least it did on my hair.</li>
            <li> I was concerned that it wouldn&#x27;t stick to mine, and it proved me VERY wrong.</li>
            <li> and it wasn&#x27;t as bad as the 1st application...</li>
            <li> The washing out process wasn&#x27;t as bad as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> 90% of the bad reviews are from people who are trying to apply this without reading anything.&lt;br /&gt;»Use</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve never used a henna that bled out so badly before</li>
            <li> After rinsing, the color ran really bad for a while, ruined a towel, so use one you can throw away.</li>
            <li> The smell wasn&#x27;t that bad</li>
            <li> As for the smell, I didn&#x27;t find it so bad.</li>
            <li> It was terribly clumpy and difficult to work into my hair.</li>
            <li> But what a disappointment!</li>
            <li> But, when I rinsed out the henna I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> cold water to rise!</li>
            <li> I wanted to give it no stars, but it won&#x27;t let me :(</li>
            <li> :((</li>
            <li> Followed with very cold water.</li>
            <li> but applying it was terrible, it smelled so bad, I was expecting for it to smell bad</li>
            <li> really bad the colour bleed in all the collar if my shirts, bed sheets pillow it was awful....</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Plus, it didn&#x27;t have that nasty smell that henna often has.</li>
            <li> I have horrible hair!</li>
            <li> Horrible decision.</li>
            <li> Terrible product.  </li>
            <li> , I believe a lot of the people leaving the horrible reviews didn&#x27;t use the product correctly.</li>
            <li> This is the worst product ever!</li>
            <li> My hair looks terrible now.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> Beautiful vibrant color, minimal bleeding! I mixed 1/4 cup lemon juice, a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar, and the rest water with 100g of powder to make my paste. Dye release is immediate, which is convenient but oddly unlike other henna dyes. I left it on my hair for about 7 hours and rinsed using conditioner to help get it out. Followed with very cold water. My hair feels healthy and strong, unlike box dye which fries my ends. Definitely will be using this again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to dye my hair a vibrant red for years. Permanent hair dye left my hair unhealthy and faded quickly. I came across this product and after reading the reviews and decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used Henna in the past, but never had such great results as this! Beautiful color. The shade stuck right away and shimmers in the sun. I can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s henna. My hair feels soft, looks shiny and healthy. The color lasted really well and whenever I feel the need for a refresher I just apply again. My hair looks better every time I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s great that it comes with gloves and the shower cap also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product to anyone trying henna. I get compliments all of the time. I&#x27;ll never use anything else again!</li>
            <li> This is the best hair dye I have ever used!!!  I have tried different chemical dyes in the past; they all make my scalp itch and hurt like crazy.  With this dye my scalp is clear, not flaky, and the color is amazing.  I have applied my second coat of the dye and the color is so much richer than the first time I applied it.  I will continue to use this dye for years to come.  Be on the lookout for my next order very soon.</li>
            <li> My favorite henna on the market! It&#x27;s one of the few that doesn&#x27;t make my hair way too dark.</li>
            <li> I have never before dyed my hair  with henna before, and so I was a bit in the dark when I ordered this. However, I recieved the product very very quickly, and it was amazing! It came with very detailed instructions and was very simple and easy to use. The color of my hair turned out beautifully and I plan on ordering this product again to dye my hair.</li>
            <li> I thought this would only work on light colored hair, but it worked really well on my dark brown, previously dyed, hair. This honestly worked better than the hair dye I had just recently (about a month ago) applied to my hair. Wish I had gone with this first, but I was skeptical. They only thing I didn&#x27;t really like about this product is that it bleeds a lot! ALOT! Chemically dyed hair bleeds too, for a couple of weeks. But this was excessive. I ruined a couple of light shirts because my hair would still be wet and it would stain my clothing. You&#x27;ll ruin towels too right after a washing your hair. But, I will probably still use this product again in the future. It didn&#x27;t dry out my hair, it definitely improved it by making it softer and skinnier. My hair smelled and felt muddy for like 3 days, but honestly... it was worth it. I&#x27;ve had this product in for a while now and I keep getting compliments. Tip: the longer you leave it in your hair the better the results. I left it in for a good 3 hours and rinsed out with cold water as directed. WORKS!</li>
            <li> Amazing results &amp; fast shipping!!</li>
            <li> Amazing color and great quality, I actually didn&#x27;t use the whole packet so I can touch up in about 6 weeks! I mixed my henna (this time) with the hibiscus and the color is amazing. I have dark 1b African American nappy or however you want to call it and my hair loves this stuff. It does deep conditioning but I still recommend in doing a deep conditioning treatment bc the henna can leave the hair a lil dry for a couple days. I left it on over night (about 7 hours) but prior to applying it I let the mix (henna, hibiscus, honey,acv, cinnamon, tresseme conditioner, oils, and hot boiling water) sit over night. The henna process is MESSY but this was my 2nd time applying it and it wasn&#x27;t as bad as the 1st application...still messy tho lol...it&#x27;s worth it. My hair now is a deep purple, subtle and not loud...I am a proud henna head and will be purchasing again soon!</li>
            <li> this came out perfect! i love it.</li>
            <li> Hair dye worked perfectly! I previously dyed my hair red (and still would like my hair to be red). No damage, weird color changes, etc happened because like the package says, this is 100% pure henna. It has none of the metals that will turn your hair green or make it melt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was definitely anxious and afraid of the outcome but so far it&#x27;s very close to the color that I want. I will wait another 24 hours (it has been exactly 24 since I washed the dye out) to see what the actual color will be. Apparently henna darkens over 48 hours after dying because it doesn&#x27;t have the additives that speed up the coloring process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found it no harder to apply than regular hair dye, and I even missed the same places that I typically do when using commercial dyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller shipped the dye very quickly and provided excellent instructions, as well as a hair cap and gloves! I will be recommending this seller/product to anyone who wants to dye their hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first photo is very similar to the shade of my hair before using the henna. It faded a lot. Second photo is 24 hours after the henna has been washed out. I left the henna in my hair for 4 hours to get this color. My hair comes down to my brastrap and is pretty thin. I used the entire package and had about a tablespoon left over, if that helps anyone.</li>
            <li> I used the deep red color mix and I used cherry and hibiscus double-brewed tea as my liquid for the henna paste I applied to my hair. It came out fantastically. I will definitely purchase this again.</li>
            <li> I color my hair alot and my hair was fried. While it didnt really do a good job coloring my hair, probulary cuz they are a ton of chemicals already in there but it sure did restore it. My hair is softer and shiny. And the stuff does stink so be prepared. It makes the hair feel like you washed it with dirt for the first two days when you first get it out, but feels awesome after the next shampoo</li>
            <li> This review is for the Deep Red henna color.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve treated my hair with henna several times before. My first time was with regular henna from The Henna Guys. The color came out extremely pigmented, but pretty orange, since it was pure henna. It wasn&#x27;t ideal but I didn&#x27;t care since the condition of my hair improved SO MUCH from just one use. I straighten it often so it was extremely damaged. I broke some comb teeth trying to get rid of the gnarly knots that would always form in the back and at the ends (even after conditioning and oiling it up it took me an hour to do a half assed job). I tried oil treatments and leave in conditioners, but they didn&#x27;t do much and mostly just made my hair look oily and weighed it down. But after one henna treatment my hair felt amazing, and I knew right away that I&#x27;d be using it for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second time I used henna, I decided to save some money by getting the Godrej mix with 9 herbs. I thought it would be a good deal since you get more of it and there are other plant powders in it that are supposed to be beneficial to hair. I was disappointed to find that it didn&#x27;t make my hair as soft as the Henna Guys henna did. Also, my hair came out much brassier, less pigmented, and dryer, which was a pretty bad combination. I wasn&#x27;t very happy, but I kept using it throughout the year. I really wanted to finish what I had left, but I eventually gave in and bought the Deep Red color from the Henna Guys. I had already had a great experience with one of their products, so I hoped I would be equally happy with this purchase. In fact, I was even happier than the first time. I was absolutely blown away by how much it repaired my damaged, dry hair (again), and how VIBRANT the color came out on my dark brown hair! Not only that, but due to the hibiscus powder, it started out looking almost black, but with strong, gorgeous purple and red highlights that bring me compliments even 2 months later. The best I can describe the color is a beautiful black cherry. Don&#x27;t even get me started on how magnificent it looks when the sunlight is hitting it at the right angle! I honestly can&#x27;t remember the last time someone had complimented my hair. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this henna powder. The only drawback of the Deep Red version is that it bleeds orange for a while, but for me it wasn&#x27;t that big of a deal. I just use an old towel to dry my hair and it&#x27;s all good. It&#x27;s no different than what you have to deal with with a semi-permanent dye. I saw some people giving out low ratings because of this issue, but it&#x27;s not as bad as they made it out to be. It&#x27;s 100% worth it for me. After 2 months, there&#x27;s very minimal orange bleed, and while the color is less deep and less purple, it STILL doesn&#x27;t look brassy. The purple tones still come out, just not as strongly as before. The color is definitely more red now, and my hair is still looking great. Seriously, this stuff is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll try to add some photos soon!a beautiful black cherry.

            <li> I used this henna just a week after applying Lush&#x27;s Caca Rouge henna and I loved that it made my hair a very nice deep red. The color was phenomenal but the only issue is that my hair bled for a month and a half. I know how to correctly rinse my hair out which I did for an hour after application in addition with a creamy conditioner but my hair still bled. To me, the fantastic color this left was not worth the trouble of having bleeding red hair. I mixed my henna with hibiscus tea and some fresh lemon juice.</li>
            <li> Was more of an earthy Brick Red.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the best henna I have ever found!  Perfect root coverage and deep, rich color! For those complaining about how this runs for many shampoos afterward, well, that is just the price you pay with henna for good coverage that gets the roots. With this henna, you know that your efforts will be duly rewarded!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using henna for about 15 years. I was living abroad for a number of years, and someone convinced me to try henna. I loved it and have been using it ever since. The color is wonderful, and my hair is in beautifully healthy condition with no split ends whatsoever. I bought henna in bulk from the local market. Never used gloves. I would be embarrassed by the orange stains on my hands, but found that if I did a lot of dishes after hennaing my hair, about half of the stain would go away and the rest would fade after the next few days. It usually took about three shampoos before it would quit bleeding from my hair. But my hair turned a deep burgundy color that I adore, became ridiculously healthy and fuller, and I got tons of compliments on the shine and color. Including, like another reviewer, the comment that my hair looked like it had shiny tinsel in it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I came back to the States, I brought about a kilo of henna from the market back with me. And it lasted a good long time. When that finally ran out, I went to our local market and, lo and behold, found bulk henna there. I tried it out. What a disaster! I can&#x27;t remember much about the color, don&#x27;t think it did a good job. What I do remember is picking the sticks and stubble out of my hair for days afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I searched the web and ended up buying what is probably the most popular brand in the US. I used it for quite a while, but it seemed like my roots were showing more and more, until there were a good two inches of roots with little to no coverage, even after they would have received about three applications by then. The henna would quit bleeding afterthe second shampoo, and the stains on my hands were minimal. It was terribly clumpy and difficult to work into my hair. I was not terribly pleased with this henna, but ordered again. With this batch, my hair never bled at all after the first rinse, and my hands didn&#x27;t stain at all! Which equals no color in your hair either. I tried adding herbal tea and hibiscus to try to get some more color, but to the same results. If a person is going to put up with the smell and sit with a mud-pack on their head for eight hours, one expects some sort of pay-off!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried some henna available at the local health food/grocery store and also online. It stunk to high heaven, so much so that I could hardly tolerate it. And same result as with the other henna...a little bit of dull yellowish stain and no root coverage. It was all going down-hill rapidly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was truly ready to give up on henna and go the chemical dye route. And then I came across this henna! And, yes, it does rock! I could tell immediately when I mixed it up and got a small amount on my thumb that wearing gloves during application was going to be mandatory. I left it on the usual eight hours, and when I took off the towel in eager anticipation after rinsing this henna out, I was absolutely amazed at both the color and the coverage! For the first time ever, my hair was completely covered all the way to the roots, including that terribly difficult area around the hairline. And with the most lovely deep henna color ever!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I was shopping and decided to try this henna, I also purchased another brand that bragged about its astoundingly high lawsone content (that&#x27;s the part of henna that does the dying). It also had great reviews on the lovely rosey red color, and I was even more eager to try that one. But what a disappointment! No need to wear gloves at all with that one. It left a barely detectable, dingiest of yellow stain on my roots, seemed to dull the color of my previously applied henna on the rest, and no bleeding past the first shampoo. I was sooo disappointed, and back to applying Henna Guys henna two days later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After my long experience with henna, I am convinced that almost all the henna sold in the United States is very poor quality henna that would never sell in the country of origin. I am equally convinced that the Henna Guys have managed to find and obtain a superior quality of henna that even discerning natives would scramble to get. It has a lovely smooth and slippery texture that makes application a dream and is a sign of high quality henna. The texture makes it easy to cover all your hair with less henna and means less clumps of \\&quot;mud\\&quot; that you can&#x27;t get worked into your hair. The smell is fairly pleasant, much better than some other hennas I&#x27;ve tried and not at all objectionable. And the resulting color, well that says it all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To make a long story short, if you want healthy red hair and want to be properly rewarded for all the work and time that applying henna requires, BUY THIS HENNA! You will not be disappointed! If you want healthy hair in a different color, check out all the Henna Guys&#x27; other colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This review is for the deep red henna, and I have medium brown hair. It turns my hair a beautiful deep burgundy, with my few grays a deep copper red. If you have blond or gray hair, the result will be more reddish orange than deep red wine at first, and you might want to try a different shade.</li>
            <li> I have been using henna for 2 years I have medium to dark brown hair with 10 percent gray.  This henna dye releases instantly and the color gave me a deep shiny cherry red.  I loved it.  The only down side was the henna continued to bleed every time I washed my hair.  Luckily it has not stained my towels.  The color has faded since I first did it.  If not for that I would have given five stars.  It still beats chemical dyes.</li>
            <li> This was my first experience with Henna. I dye my hair a LOT and was ready to try something new that wouldn&#x27;t kill my hair this time. I went with Henna because I read it dyed great over dark hair and I didn&#x27;t want to bleach. However this was not the case. The Henna took pretty well my first use but only dyed the lighter/pre-bleached portions of my hair and did not take to my natural roots at all. The 2nd go was the same results. The color was not as bright as the other reviews had made it seem, I was looking for fire engine red and got more of a deep red/burgundy. It smells pretty bad, which I was prepared for but the smell lingered in my hair for about a week afterward despite shampooing and conditioning. I was told my hair looked more healthy at least but I did not feel a noticeable difference in it. Henna is not the dye for me.</li>
            <li> I have had Henna for my hair for a long time now, and had previously been pretty faithful to another web retailer, until now. This is by far the richest color I have ever had. I am hooked! It rinsed about the same as every other henna I have had, which for the record, is not a quick process. It took about 15 minutes to get all of the henna rinsed out. Immediately after rinsing, I saw the difference. This formula left my hair the most vibrant shade of red I have ever had. EVER!!! I am in love! If you have not tried henna, or even if you have, you NEED to try this mix. It is the BEST</li>
            <li> I love this henna, I&#x27;ve tried the Rainbow brand henna before and they don&#x27;t even compare! This henna goes on so smooth and not clumpy, it makes my hair feel full of life and super shiny. The color is very vibrant, but not quiet as &amp;#34;Ariel Red&amp;#34; as pictured in the circle on the package. The color stays pretty bright for about a month. I bought 3 packets and got 1 free, best deal online!</li>
            <li> First off they ship FAST so great device for that. My hair - pixie cut, very thick, and dark brown at the roots. I had previously dyed it (to many times) trying to get a deep red and last week used a competitors henna that had sort of reddened it to what I wanted but was orange in some areas. So I found this and thought why not? I mixed it with strongly brewed hibiscus tea in hopes of amping the red and added about 10 drops of lavender oil for the smell. I left it on just over 3 hours with 2 processing caps and a sock cap on then \\&quot;washed\\&quot; with a fair amount of V05 conditioner. I thought this rinsed easier than the previous henna had and the final color is darker yet has more red tones. My virgin roots match the dyed areas and the whole head is more uniform, though the previous splotchiness could have been due to my henna newb status. It also covered my greys and made them a pretty ruby color where the other made them orange. I prefer this product and will likely continue to use it. I have a friend waiting to see my opinion on this vs the previous henna and I plan to steer her to Henna Guys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note for dark brunettes. You know who you are, the ones who constantly have people call your hair black only to grumble back \\&quot;its dark BROWN\\&quot;. You will not get the picture color in all likelihood. Henna cannot lighten hair, only chemicals can. You will get a lovely deep garnet color. Still dark but with rich red tones.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a couple of other red hennas. Lush&#x27;s red henna brick, and Light Mountain&#x27;s bright red. THIS red is my favorite! Full disclosure: I did mix in around 2T of hibiscus powder before I realized it was already listed in the(2) ingredients. This is by far the easiest to use among those I&#x27;ve tried because it is also so much finer. The others were so clumpy and harder to mix. The red is gorgeous! I cant stop staring at it myself! I do have some gray. The other 2 reds I tried made my grays look shiny and pretty, but more orange. This is more cherry.</li>
            <li> It is definitely a great product, I have been using henna for years but I never found one that could dye my hair that much. It really looked like the picture in the box. Plus, it didn&#x27;t have that nasty smell that henna often has. Great product.&lt;br /&gt;Only minor problem, my hair kept bleeding color for two weeks when I washed it, but the color didn&#x27;t fade much.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> its does stink and color was not as vivid as i was hoping it would be i could have just bought the box at walgreens like usual and could have had the same outcome</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve made up my mind to go as natural as I possibly can when it comes to hair products. I wanted to maintain red hair without using pharmacy box dyes, even if they contain no ammonia like Natural Instincts. Google led me to consider henna, and that led me to looking up reviews of this particular brand and color on Amazon. I was swayed by the overwhelming positive reviews for this product and decided to buy myself 100 grams.&lt;br /&gt;It arrived far more quickly than I expected, and that made me thrilled before I even started. The instructions are very clear and simple. I used hot water, cinnamon, and a cup of water that I steeped 2 teabags of passion tea and 2 bags of chamomile tea into to help intensify the red. Unfortunately for me, the mix ran a little thin, so I just added regular flour until it thickened from being sauce-like into cake batter- like. Adding flour created many lumps which I tried very hard to beat out by using a potato masher, but in the end I gave up and decided to use it on my hair the way it was by that point, remaining lumps and all.&lt;br /&gt;I flipped my hair upside down and stuck my head into the bowl. Keeping my head down, I used my hands to spread the goop all into my hair, making sure to get the roots first and foremost. Then I lifted my head, piled my hair on the top of my head, and kept massaging the mix onto my head until I used all the of the mix. I then put the included plastic shower cap over my head, wrapped a towel turban-style over THAT, and watched Netflix for two and a half hours.&lt;br /&gt;Rinsing the goop out wasn&#x27;t so bad, definitely not as bad as rinsing out henna hair dye from Lush! The color did bleed for me for about 2 weeks after application, but it wasn&#x27;t THAT bad and not at all bothersome, just something I noticed, and it only bled when i washed my hair, it didn&#x27;t stain my pillow or clothing or anything like that at all.&lt;br /&gt;The color is BEAUTIFUL! You may not be impressed at first right after your shower, and that&#x27;s absolutely fine. The henna takes about 2-3 days to fully oxidize, and even then you may not be completely impressed, it may seem too dark or not as RED as you wished. Give it some time. A few washes later, the color lightens up and you start noticing this gorgeous red hue, especially in light, natural or indoor. And the henna has definitely made my hair feel stronger and healthier, and definitely GLOSSIER!&lt;br /&gt;Before using this henna, I had dyed my hair with Clairol&#x27;s ammonia free box dye four months prior. I still had a nice red color in my hair, and I was worried the henna would significantly darken most of my hair because of the dye and the only way to notice that I had red in my hair would be under intense sunlight. Not the case at all. The henna masked my Clairol dye wonderfully without darkening it too much and the red is definitely noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely recommend this product to anyone who wishes for healthy, glossy, natural looking red-hued hair. Even if you aren&#x27;t crazy about the way the color comes out on you (results vary due to natural hair color, virgin  vs treated hair, etc) the health benefits of the henna will make you grateful you tried it anyway. Color can always be corrected by another henna product (unless you wish to go lighter...)&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased, I will definitely buy another 100 grams very soon to upkeep the color.ine.

            <li> I&#x27;ve never used henna before and bought this and absolutely loved it! Keeps my hair red without the chemicals! Couldn&#x27;t ask for anything better!</li>
            <li> Let me start out by saying, i have NEVER written a review this is my first. I have horrible hair! My hair is super thin and flimsy and tangles when the wind blows. I haven&#x27;t found a hairdresser to make me happy yet, to top it of i am SEVERELY allergic to chemical hair dyes. I have lived the past 16 years accepting that i will grow old and grey with honor.until last friday when i got my hair done for a whopping $170 to come yet again home and want to cry. At home i started researching, after i found i was allergic to common hair dye i tried henna once and it didn&#x27;t work for me so i spend the next 16 years being upset . After the disaster at the hairdresser i figured that i will try henna again , god knows I&#x27;ve wasted  before, i couldn&#x27;t be happier. I am still in awe that i have found something that actually works!!!! Nothing has ever worked!!! And i love the result! Thank you Henna!</li>
            <li> Okay so first things first, I bought this product in Deep Red.&lt;br /&gt;Second, I have dyed my hair so many times since I was 14. Before I used this product, I used a color stripper on my hair to try to get rid of any color build up because no dye was sticking to my hair. I read numerous reviews of this product and did lots of research over henna; what it is, what it does, how to mix it, etc.&lt;br /&gt;I heard this stuff was permanent, that&#x27;s why I went with it. I thought it would make my hair permanently red because every time I dye my hair something other than red, I tell myself that I&#x27;m gonna run back to red because it works best for my skin tone and everybody loves it.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I mixed it with warm/hot tea and avocado oil to help nourish my hair a bit while it was sitting.&lt;br /&gt;It dyed my roots a lovely red color, but the rest of my hair was unchanged.&lt;br /&gt;Let me tell you something, this stuff leaves so much buildup in my hair and it made my ends snap off. My hair isn&#x27;t shiny, it isn&#x27;t softer than it was before I started, it doesn&#x27;t look amazing or anything. It looks like crap.&lt;br /&gt;The color that was even there on my midshaft-ends washed out. The red is still in my roots. If only that was the color of my hair all over i&#x27;d be satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;I guess this stuff just doesn&#x27;t work for me. Sucks too because it supposedly is supposed to make hair feel/look better/ make it stronger. I wouldn&#x27;t know.&lt;br /&gt;If anyone knows how long i can wait before I dye it again with regular dye or if I could bleach over it and revert back to my chemical hair dye that&#x27;d be great.&lt;br /&gt;Overall extremely disappointed, especially since I paid a lot more than normal for something I thought would be more beneficial for me.</li>
            <li> I have (had, ugh) light blonde hair and decided to try out the red with this henna dye. My hair turned clown ugly red and looked horrible. No one told met that henna is almost completely irreversible and nothing will take it out. I have had to strip my hair, bleach it three times, and dye it twice just to get it back to an ugly greenish light brown color. I quite literally detest this dye and never will do my own hair again. It was such a pain in the a** and I sincerely regret allowing this to touch my hair. Horrible decision. Would never recommend. I guess I should mention though that it is in fact pure henna because it did not react with chemical dyes afterwards, so it is worth one star.</li>
            <li> my hair is awesome and it seems even healthier than before I put the henna on it. I look so foooine.</li>
            <li> I have used Henna before and never had this issue, but this one bleeds a lot! Loved the color but every time it would rain- or after a nice swim- my clothes would be stained. Like I said, its not the henna I have a problem with- its this brand of henna- wouldn&#x27;t recommend</li>
            <li> I have been applying henna to my hair now for 2 years. It&#x27;s messy, it&#x27;s time consuming and it&#x27;s worth it. This color, deep red, has everything I was looking for in a henna. My recipe is deep/dark red, mixed with one egg, 2 tsp of coconut oil and a splash of lemon. I steep hibiscus tea and use that as the water. If you can stand it, leave in for 6 plus hours.</li>
            <li> ****UPDATED****&lt;br /&gt;Although I remain impressed by the way it provided deep pigment over dark non-chemically treated African-American hair. It has been two months since I used the henna to dye my hair and I am still rinsing it out every time I wash my hair. I&#x27;m not sure if this stuff will EVERY wash out. The water still runs red from my scalp every time I&#x27;m in the shower, every day that I workout and sweat, etc. I&#x27;ve ruined so many white clothes and a number of pillows and pillow cases...this stuff not only effectively stains hair...but everything you own. I was so excited about the initial results that I purchased a huge package of it. I was I could return it. I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s worth another treatment!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was my original review:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used all sorts of henna on my hair, and have found that on my natural African-American hair it created a variation in color that only I could notice. I purchased Henna Guys Deep Red hoping my hair (which is either the darkest brown or the lightest black) would at least become an auburn color. I was impressed that this henna doesn&#x27;t require time to sit (you just mix and put it right on). I used lemon juice instead of water to enhance the color. But, when I rinsed out the henna I was disappointed. My hands were bright orange, but my hair appeared unchanged.  I had left the henna on 9 hours (with 2 under the dryer) rather than the suggested 3. I didn&#x27;t notice the color at all until I got to work. Under my office lights I saw the orange, and on the drive home under the sunlight it looked fire engine red. That night my fianc&amp;eacute; said \\&quot;when did you dye your hair bright red?\\&quot; This is the first time in my history with various henna products that anyone has ever noticed!&lt;br /&gt;Compared to many other hennas this was easy to use, just mix then apply. It&#x27;s a little grittier than some though. I find myself still washing out little sand particles. Plus, after a long time in the shower, my hair still wasn&#x27;t rinsing clear.&lt;br /&gt;This is a good product. I&#x27;ll use this again. I want to see if another application in a month will make my hair a red that is noticeable in all light. My hair feels great after one application. I&#x27;m a believer in using henna to strengthen hair. This product was a descent value, but I don&#x27;t know what people were saying about using one bag for multiple applications. I have shoulder-length  hair when straight, just past my ears curly, and this was just enough for one use. I wish they sold it in bulk!</li>
            <li> My friend recommended me to use Henna, and told me it was natural and wouldn&#x27;t hurt your hair. So I thought, hey, why not. Let&#x27;s give this stuff a shot. I shaved my head about three months ago for my mom, who is fighting breast cancer. Now that I have enough hair (about pixie cut length, virgin hair, dirty blonde), I was having the urge to color it, but I didn&#x27;t want to ruin it with chemicals. This was when Henna walked into my life!&lt;br /&gt;I decided to order a pack of Deep Red henna, because I absolutely LOVE red hair on me. I was a little nervous trying it at first, because it is really permanent and you can&#x27;t change it with chemical dye if you end up not liking it, at least that&#x27;s what I read from research. But I found a bunch of pictures on the internet from people who have used red henna and it seemed to turn out very well for others! So I just went for it. And WOW. 3 hours later I am a deep red color exactly what I was going for! I am so in love with my new hair right now and I don&#x27;t think I will ever switch to chemical dyes ever again. I only had to use about 1/3 of the bag, so I have about 2 applications left for the whole head, which is nice for touch ups! The color may change just a tad since this is the first day of applying, but as long as it&#x27;s red, I am in love. Thank you so much, I am very pleased!</li>
            <li> Beautiful color but it fades really quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been told that this henna won&#x27;t work on dark brown hair, but decided to give it a try anyway. I will update with my results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pretty messy, but if you are prepared it isn&#x27;t anything too ridiculous. The smell was not bad at all - like the package says it smells like nature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only \\&quot;complaint\\&quot; I have is that the package says that 4.5 tbsp of the powder covers short hair and 8 tbsp covers shoulder length hair... My hair is above my shoulders and I had to use the whole package. It still looks like I have some spots missing too...but that could just be me not applying correctly! (;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Update**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Left the henna for a little over 2 hours...LOVE it! The washing out process wasn&#x27;t as bad as I thought it would be. Color came out so nice! My hair now has a red wine \\&quot;glow\\&quot; to it and looks amazing in the light. Also, my hair is the shiniest/softest it has been in a long time. Will keep using this henna :)</li>
            <li> Worked beautifully, I now have reddish brown hair that glows in the sun and my hair feels much stronger.</li>
            <li> Way more of a purple red than an orange red than I expected. I will be able to dye my hair twice from one packet. I mixed mine with honey, avocado and jojoba oil and a bit of lemon juice and let it sit for 3 hours. It will turn white towels orange after it gets wet. It washes out in the laundry, but I panicked at first. You will notice orange runoff in the shower for several weeks (I wash my hair every 3 days), but it seems to have no impact on the color. I have midbrown hair with copper/red undertones and I went to Black Widow RED!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t dramatically change my dark brown hair so I&#x27;m a little disappointed there, but what I had bleached ahead of time is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;I would say that it works best on very light hair.</li>
            <li> I love the color my hair turned out, this henna is good quality, I have dark brown  almost black hair I used different brands of henna before but so far this is the best I found. It has a good texture when mixed, I mixed it with green tea, olive oil, apple cider vinegar and lavender oil, leave it on my kitchen counter overnight and the apply in the morning, It cover all my grays and I love the results.</li>
            <li> I just love this product. It is amazing how consistently it applies all over the hair. The paste is very smooth and is of great quality.</li>
            <li> I bought this dye December 31 and dyed my hair the same day it came and as a person with an allergy to store bought and chemical hair dyes this dye works wonders on my hair I originally have dark brown hair and it turned my hair dark red but it is so beautiful I didn&#x27;t even break out or anything the product came well packaged and on time with instructions and they were very specific and understandable I love this product and will look forward to buying more...</li>
            <li> Okay, so my hair was half black (front), half red (back). My original hair color is a dark auburn brown. I know they say that these color are not good for darker hair types (which I find ridiculous seeing as it&#x27;s henna, which was discovered my Indians and most of them have dark brown to black hair, but w/e). But I&#x27;m a rebel and wanted to see what it would do for me. The front (chemically dyed black): Is now a subtle, yet beautiful deep red when the sun hits it. The back (chemically dyed red) is now just a deep fiery red. I love it.&lt;br /&gt;What to expect: Even after 3 shampoo washed, like the instructions read, it still bled. I&#x27;m not fussing about this, but what I did not like was the staining of the hands orange for 2 weeks after the initial application. Every time I touched my hair, more orange stains. *sigh*&lt;br /&gt;they have finally subsided (although my nails are still orange, but nothing that a little nail polish wont cover up). And yes, my mother used the gloves while applying (although the gloves supplied were cheap and broke on her, thus her getting orange stained hands for a couple of days) . The orange came about while rinsing in the shower and then styling my hair then after.&lt;br /&gt;With that being said, I still love the color in my hair. Will use the second package next month to see if it deepens/ intensifies the color. As I have very thick hair, I needed the entire 100 grams. My mother who is an ex-beautician (and who I also had apply the henna to my hair) tells me I probably wont need the entire package next time for the touch up. Here&#x27;s to hoping! So, if you have dark hair, don&#x27;t expect the intense fiery red you see in their models, but if you like subtle, almost natural looking deep red, then yes. try it. Next time, I&#x27;m going to use surgery grade no-latex glove for application, as well as washing my hair in the shower. It&#x27;s a long process, so I suggest having a shower session dedicated to nothing but your hair (specially if you have thick, curl/ wavy, ethnic  hair, like myself).c  hair, like myself).</li>
            <li> I was a bit nervous about switching to Henna from chemical dyes. I have read a lot about the process and it seemed like it could be quite complicated. This Henna was so simple to use I thought I must be missing some steps, but it turned out gorgeous! Very red very rich and very easy! It has a very earthy smell so I added some lavender essential oil. I was also a bit put off about having to let the henna sit in my hair for hours, rather than just the quick 25 minutes with chemical dyes, but it wasn&#x27;t a problem you can make the henna thick like a past and then put it all up in a shower cap, and go about your business, its like using a hair mask :) I will definitely buy this again :) and again and again!</li>
            <li> Well, it&#x27;s definitely henna.  It turned my green hair (from a previous dye job) orange, which faded to blonde after two washes and a week. My brown hair turned red, and my black hair remained black with a brown-red hue in sunlight.  I&#x27;d done two bleach baths on my hair before putting in the henna - the bleach made my hair dry and fragile. After the henna, my hair was still dry, but it felt very strong.  my mix was 2 parts henna, 1 part olive oil and 1 part boiling water. Mixed together like pudding, very easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: I ordered again - a little put off by the changes in the shipment. Came on time, but they added some extras! Gloves and processing cap (great) and instructions that weren&#x27;t there before.&lt;br /&gt;Except the instruction sheet had stuff blacked out with sharpee? I held it under a lamp to read what they tried to black out. it was about mixing for brown hair and using the henna to lock in the brown color. what?&lt;br /&gt;if you know anything about henna, real 100% pure henna does not come in any other color than red/red-orange/red-brown. Henna is red and shades of red. pretty fishy. as far as I can tell what they sent is the same product as last time, which I liked. but I took off a star for the censored instructions and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be buying from here again&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: After reading the strange blacked out instruction sheet, I looked at the actual package of henna. This order had a sticker on the back that was not on the back of my last order. The ingredients list henna (lawsonialnermis linn) and hibiscus powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s nothing wrong with hibiscus. It&#x27;s actually a very nice hair cleanser. But It&#x27;s advertised as 100 percent henna, I wanted 100 percent henna, and now I see I have purchased diluted henna. As in I need to use way more of this powder to get the job done, because it&#x27;s not all henna. Ugh. If you want 100 percent, pure, real henna look somewhere else.</li>
            <li> I love using the Henna hair dye so much more than store bought dye and it smells like nature :). It makes my hair feel soft and rejuvenated after washing it out plus it turns my hair vibrant red, which I love. I can safely say that I will never go back to dyes with chemicals in it! Thank you!</li>
            <li> i loveee the colorm gonnabuy more for a second application to really make the color pop  love it best red color henna ive used. it does smell a bit like hay while applied but the color you acheive is worth the three or four hours of stinking lol</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I was very worried after I ordered it, and did a little bit more research. A lot of the reviews say that the smell is horrible and its soo messy and time consuming. I found those things to be untrue. The smell is almost an earthy green tea, didn&#x27;t linger like I thought it would either. As far as it being messy, what hair dye isn&#x27;t? My roommate helped me put it on my hair with a dye brush and things went smoothly. Maybe got a little bit on my arm and ear but none of it stained. I was very worried it would stain my ears and face, but honestly it didn&#x27;t leave any stains. I even used a light brown towel during the whole dye process and that didn&#x27;t stain either. The whole process of putting the dye on my head took about 45 minutes. Then I left it on my head for 3 hours. I put the shower cap over my hair, then wrapped it in a towel to keep the dye from getting crunchy. My hair turned a beautiful deep red just as explained. It faded on the underneath where I had chemically dyed it... But I will definitely be fixing soon. The customer service is more than helpful and responds very quickly. This is the only company I will be buying henna from!  The color is perfect</li>
            <li> I love, love, love, this brand.  The color is intense and beautiful.  It is very messy, but as you become more experienced with using henna, it gets easier.  The customer service is also top notch.  They will answer any questions with a great attitude and very promptly.</li>
            <li> Beautiful and true color, deep red. Wonderful and sexy! Helps my processed bleached hair feel soft again and evens out my tones from too many colors in the last year. Nice way to skip the chemicaly expensive trips to Sally&#x27;s beauty for me and do my stuff at home without a hitch.&lt;br /&gt;I leave it on 3 hours. One packet usually is enough to color my waist length head of hair, but maybe other people have thicker hair (mine is medium/thick hair). Smells like you&#x27;re at a natural spa, though I have to say I start to get sick of the smell after a day or so. The smell lingers a bit for a day and then dissipates naturally.&lt;br /&gt;Love it!</li>
            <li> I started using henna almost a year ago.in the beginning,  I did it every 2 wks (bcuz my hair was dyed red with chemicals)..i started using henna guys in December 2013 i think and I LOVE  it. I use the &amp;#34;deep red&amp;#34; one and the color results are GLORIOUS! On top of that, my hair has never been more healthy, thick, shiny and amazing!Ppl are always stopping me and asking me what i use to get my hair so gorgeous. I just did it again 2 days ago as a matter of fact :) i MIGHT be addicted to it.</li>
            <li> This was my first time using henna. I was a bit apprehensive about how it would turn out; but I&#x27;m so glad I tried it out! I thought it was really easy to apply and use (I do have really short hair so that&#x27;s probably why.) I simply mixed it with warm water, grapefruit essential oil, and the henna and left it on for 4 and 1/2 hours. I really didn&#x27;t think it smelled bad at all, but perhaps that was because the grapefruit. I had medium to darkish brown hair before. The henna gave my hair a really lovely dark red. I&#x27;ve already gotten many complements on my hair!</li>
            <li> This is the first time that I used Henna on my hair.  I must say, I love it!  I had a lot of gray and had stopped using chemical hair dyes sometime ago due to obvious health risks involved when using chemical hair dyes products.  I mixed two packets of the medium brown with three teaspoons of the Deep Red with distilled water and left the henna mixture on my hair for 4 1/2 hours.  My hair came out with the most wonderful darker brown with some awesome red highlights which used to be my ugly grays.  The texture of my hair has also improved dramatically as well.  A far cry when using the chemical hair dyes in the past.  I am so happy that I did my research.  The end result was well worth the wait!  Love you Henna Guys!</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve dyed my hair with regular dyes from regular super markets for years. I am 45 plus and after all the years of chemicals really wanted to move away from all the harsh ingredients. I have naturally extremely thick hair and although I&#x27;m fair with freckles my hair is very dark almost black. Now at my age I have white hair coming in that I still want to cover. Well when I first mixed the henna with water it was a dark burnt orange color and I was a little concerned and hesitant as I don&#x27;t care for that color at all with my skin tone. For 5 years I&#x27;ve been using a well known semi-permanent color of dark burgundy red which I love colorwise. Well the henna matched it perfectly after waiting 2 hrs. and letting it air dry. I&#x27;m so pleased. The smell everyone complains about was not bad at all. It just smells of hay lightly. No biggy. The texture of the mixture is nice and fine. I still will have to rinse again perhaps tommorow..but I&#x27;m so glad I get to keep my deep red and no longer have to come in contact with harsh chemicals. The roots are definately bright but as the white hair grows out I can tell it will make nice highlights around my face. Thanks for a great product especially for a first time henna user.</li>
            <li> The color was amazing, but as other reviewers have stated, it does bleed for quite some time. Would still use it again.</li>
            <li> I love this nashville all had dye</li>
            <li> It was very dark red the first week,,,then with every wash it bleed out really bad the colour bleed in all the collar if my shirts, bed sheets pillow it was awful....will Never use this product again.</li>
            <li> I have been going gray since I was 16 and coloring my hair for years while wearing a relaxer and a short cut. I went natural about four years ago and found that permanent hair dye was too harsh for my dry hair.  Semi-permanent dye for caucasian hair worked for a while, but still left my hair dry and brittle; not to mention that the color was dramatically different on the now white roots than the rest of the hair. I wanted something that would color my white streaks and leave me with highlights on the graying areas and non gray areas without damage.  This is it! I have been using this product now for about 8 months and my hair has never looked or felt better. My skunk stripe is the coolest shade of maroon/red and I have highlights all over where the rest of my hair is losing pigment. I get compliments on my color all the time now! I use lemon juice instead of water- seems help it penetrate my kinky resistant hair better and I add a tablespoon of conditioner to the henna &#x27;goo&#x27; before applying.  If you have African American hair, a deep, preferably overnight, conditioning is a must after color. Leaves your hair stronger, healthier, shinier, and smoother.  Does not straighten hair! I stock up on it now and recommend it to anyone who&#x27;s not scared of intense color.</li>
            <li> AWESOME COLOR!! I&#x27;ve been using henna for years now and I always get the same orangey red color, not this time. The red is so brilliant and awesome. Looks like My head is on fire</li>
            <li> great colour, always comes out healthy. but it bleeds...so...much....every time i&#x27;ve dyed it, it bleeds a yellow colour, I can&#x27;t wash it enough to stop it. other than that its great, i get a lot of compliments.</li>
            <li> Gorgeous color, but it&#x27;s STILL RUNNING AFTER 1 MONTH with using cold water. I don&#x27;t think I will use it again.</li>
            <li> The color isn&#x27;t like how it looks in the picture :/ Also when you put it in your hair, IT BLEEDS EVERYWHERE. It completely ruined my carpet. Would not recommend</li>
            <li> I really like the color turned  out very nice. I applied  henna&amp;indigo mix  month before  I applied this one, henna&amp;indigo helped to get my hair darken.I work out  a lot and  when I sweat  it is bleeding  there is orange sweat coming down to my face  also  bleeds in the shower which I don&#x27;t mind but orange sweat doesn&#x27;t really  look good. Also  buy 3 get one free deal has ended up paying  double shipping for flate rate package  which is 5.90$. if  you don&#x27;t care about bleeding and paying double shipping its worth to get it.</li>
            <li> I am a first time user of henna and I was pleasantly surprised with the results. My hair is a dark brown and I&#x27;m Korean so my hair is very thick. I have very long hair below my shoulders. I was not prepared for the smell of the product. It smelled and looked like a dookie. Which isn&#x27;t the sellers fault, I just had no idea what I was in for lol. It came with gloves and a shower cap. I recommend buying your own since mine ripped almost immediately when I tried to cover my massive hair. Also, be prepared for the messiness. Use a bunch of wet paper towels to clean up any spillage you have while applying because no matter how care you are, it will inevitably get on the floor and on yourself. No worries though cos it doesn&#x27;t stain like typical hair dye from the drugstore. It comes off easily with water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very happy with how healthy my hair feels. Its very silly and it made my hair look all one rich dark color. However, there isn&#x27;t a lot of rich red in it likening had hoped. I&#x27;m going to try the deep red next time to see if it might up the color a bit. But overall I am very pleased with the way it made my hair look and feel.</li>
            <li> I liked the color it gave my hair at first but applying it was terrible, it smelled so bad, I was expecting for it to smell bad but it was worse than I thought and the color didn&#x27;t last long in my hair, now my hair is reddish brown.</li>
            <li> Works great ! excellent color and hair is now thick and soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many red hennas on the market right now, Light Mountain, Henna Maiden, Lush....The Henna Guys wins out hands down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is so easy to use, and it actually takes me less henna using Henna Guys to do a full head application, then any other brand. My hair is all the way to my butt, and very thick. It takes me 2 packets with Henna Guys, verses 3-4 with Henna Maiden and others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My color is always super vibrant, even a month after henna-ing. People ask me about it constantly. It also helped revive my damaged chemically dyed hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Customer for life! Thanks Henna Guys!</li>
            <li> ***STOP*** DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT, DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.  I PURCHASED THIS FROM &amp;#34;THE HENNA GUYS&amp;#34; I ALWAYS USE HENNA TO COLOR THE FEW GREY HAIRS, BUT THIS PRODUCT WAS A NIGHTMARE.  I FOLLOWED THE DIRECTIONS ON THE PACKAGE, AND A WEEK LATER MY FAMILY AND I WENT SWIMMING.  THE COLOR JUST RAN OUT FROM MY HAIR DOWN MY BACK AND SHOULDER INTO MY NEW SWIM SUIT &amp; INTO THE WATER.  LEAVING A TRAIL OF WHAT LOOKED LIKE I WAS PEEING IN THE CHILDREN S POOL..?????? SO EMBARRASSED...... STILL EVERY TIME I SHOWER IT COMING OUT THE SAME &amp; HAS RUINED MORE THAN MY NEW SWIMSUIT, TOWELS AND PJ&#x27;S.  STILL A VERY BAD EXPERIENCE, NEVER HAS HAPPENED USING OTHER HENNA PRODUCTS.</li>
            <li> I tried this henna after using Lush&#x27;s red henna bricks, and chemical dyes prior to that. I was initially really put off by the color and tried to fade it as much as possible.  It came out an extremely vibrant purple/red that lasted for a week. After no success at fading it myself, a week or two later  it settled into the color I had hoped it would. The worst thing about this henna is that it bleeds CONSTANTLY, or at least it did on my hair. I couldn&#x27;t really find any solution to that online either. So every time I took a shower, went swimming, and even got sweaty my hair would bleed orange/yellow. If you&#x27;re looking for a subtle auburn red and do not want to wait for it to fade, then you should probably try something else. However, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product based on the bleeding quality alone.</li>
            <li> No!!! Don&#x27;t buy!! I have used henna countless times not only on hair but also skin and have never had any problems. This henna dried out my hair to the point that I could NO LONGER BRUSH IT! How does that sound? Not even being able to brush your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; On the bright side- this henna is long lasting. Too bad for me because I can&#x27;t get it out all of the way even after 6 shampoos, 8 conditions and 3 deep conditions. After some of it came out, I ended up buying Splat (something I did NOT want to do again) just to make up for the lacking red hair. Even to this day, about a week and a half later, I still have trouble brushing/combing through my hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Henna &amp; indigo 2 step for jet black hair,(my first x using henna,I needed something natural bcz last few times I used Chemical dye half of it fell out! I already had a problem with hair fall I was thinking I would have to except the gray which made me sad:(&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s why am so glad I found this!&lt;br /&gt;It took half the day to mix, apply washout mix apply washout,but it was sooooo worth it! Getting complements &amp; love how soft/strong/thick my hair feels(use a deep conditioning product after) I feel like I&#x27;m wearing someone else&#x27;s hair! &amp; it actually seems to have stopped the 5yr hair falling nightmare! I still see a few grays but maybe I didn&#x27;t reach those ones with the mix,there&#x27;s also things you can add to help cover grays or make it more red/blk, there&#x27;s a lot of YouTube videos on Henna.&lt;br /&gt;color,Thining hair,Grays or if just healthier hair,I can&#x27;t say about(brand)being i&#x27;ve only tryd this1.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: it takes a lot of time! you&#x27;ll need some old clothes and towels because it stains, I slept with a towel over my pillow&lt;br /&gt;Good luck ;)</li>
            <li> I have been hannaing my hair for a little over a year now and have tried 5 different brands (I want it redder than what I keep getting) I ordered the deep red, from their picture it was more of the color I have been trying to obtain, but no luck this came out worse than any other henna I have tried. I did this henna treatment about a week before me and my husband were going out of town for our anniversary.  On the car ride he told me I looked like an ompa lumpa (remember this was a week after I used this henna to dye my hair). It bleed for over a month. My hair looked like it was peeing a dehydrated persons dark yellow pee for weeks. My hair ruined everything white in our hotel room for the whole week we were there. I would take hour long cold/warm showers at the hotel trying to rinse it all out, sometimes even 2 or 3 times a day. I probably stained at least 30 towels and countless pillow cases. I wanted to hide from the maids that cleaned our room I was so embarrassed. How do you explain yellow/orange marks on all of a nice hotels linens. My hair ruined our anniversary. Even worse 6 weeks after the treatment my daughter said it looked like I died my hair with pee in front of several people at a gathering,  we were outside and instead of the sun showing a nice red henna tint it showed bright yellow. I will never buy this brand again. (My natural hair color is a medium brown)</li>
            <li> I really liked it...my 1st time using henna and it was a messy process...but I loved how my hair came out...nice vibrant color.  will definitely purchase again</li>
            <li> Amazing long lasting color. I love this stuff I&#x27;ll never go back to harsh chemicals. Great price too can&#x27;t beat the results</li>
            <li> It takes well and last.</li>
            <li> Good Evening. My first purchase from your company arrived last Friday. I have been a henna user for years but never tried your company. I really don&#x27;t have the words to express how amazed I am with the finished product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have coarse hair that is prone to dryness. It tangles easily. My mother applied the henna to my roots only. 3.5 hours later she rinsed it out; no shampoo. No bleeding. My mother wrapped my head in a towel. After a few moments I took it down and touched the top of my head. It was still warm to the touch.&lt;br /&gt;This isn&#x27;t an exaggeration. In all my years I have NEVER felt my hair THAT soft. It felt like baby hair! It felt like velvet. My mother has known my hair since I was born and all of It&#x27;s different stages and states over the years...even she could not believe!&lt;br /&gt;Even days after I did not have to put any moisturizer in my hair. It was still soft. And it still is!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Normally with other brands, I would do an oil pre-treatment before applying the henna or I would add oil to the henna itself. And regardless I would always have to follow-up with a hot oil treatment after applying the henna. NOT this time! I followed the instructions word for word. I applied and rinsed and Voila! Baby soft hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the color is concerned, I really wasn&#x27;t expecting deep red. My hair has always been color resistant. I was pleasantly surprised though. My greys were truly &amp;#34;deep red &amp;#34;. It darkened my already dark brown hair kind of like dark red lipstick that is almost black. I also noticed that my hair has a nice &amp;#34;deep red&amp;#34; hue to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After all of these years, I would never ever have believed that there was a substance that could make MY hair THIS soft. I would have thought it was a lie! It was a blessing to find your website! I am SO glad that I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to ordering again!</li>
            <li> This product is truly wonderful. I&#x27;ve been dying my hair with boxed dye for years and decided to make the switch and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. I have naturally dark brown hair and I even had it dyed a little darker and this shade of red still showed up on me. Even though my hair was so dark my hair turned a nice bright browny-red with super red highlights in the light. It looks really natural. I even mixed in some olive oil and used orange spice tea instead of hot water to combat the smell (which isn&#x27;t that bad) and added cinnamon and paprika to bring out highlights. I purchased some lavender oil and I think I&#x27;ll add that in for my next treatment. I have a little longer than shoulder length hair and only used about 50 grams so I have enough left for a whole other treatment. Will definitely re-purchase!</li>
            <li> This is lengthy, but I want to touch on everything that a beginner may be concerned about.  So first,  the info you came for.  Yes you can use it on premed hair.  They are as advertised,  metallic salt free.  I have been using Henna Guys for 4 years, they truly have a great product. I have used the deep red and now the red orange. I love both colors,  it really depends on what you are going for as to what you should choose. Now I have found the color is more intense the first month or so and does fade, however, it is different from a chemical dye. Henna fades to a more natural color where a chemical dye will lose the color entirely becoming dull with no luster.  So the henna seems to be far superior.  The only time I use it again is to get roots and roots only.  I could never do that with a chemical dye, once a month re-dying my whole head.  Now onto the process. I have shoulder length thick curly hair. I use about half a pack. Now the first time I used a whole pack, so if it is your first time using henna,  you may need more until you&#x27;re used to it.  I just mix with warm water as directed.  I don&#x27;t add anything to it, you don&#x27;t have to let it sit, just mix until it&#x27;s not powder anymore. You may need to add a little water as you go to keep it moist.  Applying to your hair is more of a process because it is like a mud mask that you are putting on your hair.  So again if it&#x27;s your first time using henna, you may need someone to help you. The smell doesn&#x27;t bother me, it smells like hay and earth.  I typically leave it in for 3 hours only as I don&#x27;t want it too dark. Rinsing out: The first time I did this, I did as directed and had a hard time getting the mask out of my hair.  Bleed for a month. Now I do it a little differently. I use warm water (not piping hot) and after an initial rinse in water I use conditioner to help get the rest out. (I don&#x27;t have a fancy conditioner, Herbal Essence with Argon Oil) By doing this I get the mask out much easier and less likely to leave bits behind. Staining: I have been very impressed. I have gotten henna on tile, counter top, my hands, and I have not had an issue with staining. Now on my skin it will last a day or so, but it fades very quickly. It truly amazes me that a product that doesn&#x27;t fade in my hair, does on my skin. Bleeding: This isn&#x27;t a big deal for me because again it washes out. Now that I&#x27;m using the conditioner, I have bleeding for maybe a week. Using nothing on my hair and it was month. Now even though it did bleed on my towels,  it washed out, so the staining wasn&#x27;t permanent.  Overall I love their henna!! It&#x27;s a great product and it lasts! I always recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for the second time but the my first time from this particular company.  The first time I used henna my hair was extremely dry afterward and didn&#x27;t feel as healthy as it had prior to using henna.  I was hesitant to reapply but did and I must say that this henna was high quality henna and is the only brand that I will be using from here on out. My color is great, my hair is just a soft as before if not softer. Thank you</li>
            <li> Terrible product.  Followed instructions to the &#x27;t,&#x27; and wound up with dull color that ran for days. Ruined multiple shirts after hair washing and even ran just while brushing my hair.</li>
            <li> I ordered this and it came very very fast so thats nice. At first it looks a little purple (on dark hair) LOOKS NOTHING LIKE THE PICTURE THOUGH!! You should show what the actual color effect is anyway. I have blonde highlights and they came out orange so do not use on blonde or dirty blonde hair because parts of my hair are natuarally dirty blonde and the color came out orange...I re-dyed a week later and it got darker orange lol but overall it&#x27;s a good product :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using henna for years.  When I first started I used really expensive body art quality henna.  It worked so much better than my hair dye.  It turned red and stayed red, even to the point of me not having to redo the ends for 8-9 months.  Then for a long time, I couldn&#x27;t find that same kind anymore and every type I got just made my hair orange and faded quickly.  I was about to give up, go with the lighter color and eventually just trim it until it all matched.  Not necessary!! This brand and color is just as good and WAY cheaper. The roots are actually redder than the rest of my hair!  It&#x27;s been about a week and has not faded. I can&#x27;t wait to do my whole head.&lt;br /&gt;Also, for first time users:&lt;br /&gt;If you are switching to henna from commercial hair dye, it takes some effort at first.  Henna and dye do not get along.  If you want to change your color alot and plan to go back to dye or get rid of the red, DO NOT USE HENNA.  This is permanent hair color amplified.  If you want your hair to be red, not fade and not be dead, buy this stuff immediately.  You may have to do it a few times in a row at the beginning but it&#x27;s okay to do that with henna since it doesn&#x27;t hurt your hair.  I think I did mine about 5 times in a two week time span.  Leave it on as long as you can.  It will take.  It just needs to get past the not playing well with the dye that&#x27;s already on your hair.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m at the point now where I think all the dyed hair has been trimmed off and it looks so much better with the henna.  Your hair will bleed yellow water for a few days but I&#x27;d get that with dye as well.  It also helps if you use cheapy conditioner when you&#x27;re rinsing it out. My hair is long, past my bra strap.  I use a very little amount each time just to do the roots.  One small packet lasts months.  But since I&#x27;m doing my whole head this time to make it all match, I&#x27;ll probably use a whole packet at one time.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re going to stick with it, buy a larger quantity at a time.  It&#x27;s cheaper and you won&#x27;t have to worry about running out.  Henna powder keeps as long as you put it in an air tight container or bag and store it in a cabinet.  It just doesn&#x27;t like light or moisture.</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful bright red! I even mixed some indigo in it to make it a little darker and it became a deep red. I switched from chemical dyes to henna and I do not regret it one bit. My hair is naturally oily and when I use henna it takes longer for my hair to feel or look like it has oil in it. My hair is thicker, healthier, and I don&#x27;t have to hand out 80 bucks to go get it dyed. This is definitely my favorite color to choose but be aware that red is very difficult to cover if you decide to change back to a brown henna!</li>
            <li> Short review:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m over the freaking moon about this stuff! I&#x27;ve been coloring my hair for seven years with chemical dyes, and in less then three days this convinced me to never do so again.&lt;br /&gt;It really smells, but it works so well that I really cannot be bothered to complain about it. The color is far more intense than you&#x27;d expect from some yellow dirt. On color alone I can already say it&#x27;s better than box dyes, but there are some other advantages as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;►Best Pros:&lt;br /&gt;»If you miss a spot, you can touch it up without worrying about the mix being bad.&lt;br /&gt;»It does a better job of sticking to my hair, and skin than it does the counters.&lt;br /&gt;»NO BURN. I am allergic to almost everything, and I had no negative reaction to this. (I&#x27;m allergic to scented soaps, metals, and most cosmetic makeups for those looking for specifics.)&lt;br /&gt;»Buying it in bulk is significantly cheaper than purchasing chemical hair dye from the store, or online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;►Cons:&lt;br /&gt;»Obviously, it smells.&lt;br /&gt;»It&#x27;s clumpy, so you&#x27;re going to have to take the time to mix it well.&lt;br /&gt;»Far more messy, and difficult to apply than regular hair dye.&lt;br /&gt;»I actually kind of hope it lightens up some. (I left it on for a little too long, and it&#x27;s darker than anticipated. This is my fault though.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;►Recommendations:&lt;br /&gt;»Check out all the colors before you settle on this one.&lt;br /&gt;»Do this on a weekend so skin stains fade before work/school/ect.&lt;br /&gt;»Invest in a black washcloth, towel, and pillowcase.&lt;br /&gt;»Use tea to scent the water!&lt;br /&gt;»READ THE DIRECTIONS. 90% of the bad reviews are from people who are trying to apply this without reading anything.&lt;br /&gt;»Use cold water to rise! Red likes to run, and cold water helps to prevent that. (Hot water will make it fade faster!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;►How it works:&lt;br /&gt;»On very blonde hair?&lt;br /&gt;Excellently! I was concerned that it wouldn&#x27;t stick to mine, and it proved me VERY wrong. I haven&#x27;t even had chemical dyes look this bold before.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;d like to skip the orange stage, you&#x27;re welcome to try leaving it in for longer. That seemed to do the trick for me, and then some.&lt;br /&gt;»On colored hair?&lt;br /&gt;I already had red in the ends of my hair, but it seems to have blended almost seamlessly with my roots. The color is essentially the same, so I&#x27;d say as long as it&#x27;s a lighter shade of red than what they&#x27;ve provided that you&#x27;re ok.&lt;br /&gt;»On eyebrows?&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t leave it on very long because it was also spread onto my skin, and I was concerned about staining.  It colored them in under fifteen minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;►Is it hard to wash out?&lt;br /&gt;»NO. And anyone that tells you that it was, isn&#x27;t washing out their normal hair dye enough as it is, or they&#x27;re not mixing the henna well enough. Mix the clumps, and apply it to your hair as it directs. When you go to wash it out, it should take maybe two minutes at most. Rough your hands carefully through your hair so that the water can get down to your scalp, and it should all come out effortlessly in that time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;►Does your hair feel like straw?&lt;br /&gt;»NO BECAUSE I ACTUALLY RINSED IT OUT. If you don&#x27;t get it all out, of course it&#x27;s going to feel like straw, you&#x27;ve still got dried powder on your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;►About the smell:&lt;br /&gt;»Does it stink?&lt;br /&gt;Of course it stinks. Take five minutes to look henna up, and you&#x27;ll understand why.&lt;br /&gt;»What does it smell like?&lt;br /&gt;All joking aside, it smells like manure, and rotting oranges. (It&#x27;s pretty awful, but the results made me turn a blind eye to it.)&lt;br /&gt;»Can you fight the smell while coloring?&lt;br /&gt;YES! Many users suggest using teas to scent the water, and for that I thank them! Mint, and Apple did not work for me, but  lavender, a smell I typically despise, did a wonderful job at distracting from it.&lt;br /&gt;»Does it still smell after you rinse it out?&lt;br /&gt;A little, but it&#x27;s nothing that you can&#x27;tcombat with body sprays, perfume oils, ect.&lt;br /&gt;»What does it smell like after you rinse it out?&lt;br /&gt;Sulfur, but I only noticed it when I pressed my nose to my hair. The next morning it was almost unnoticeable even when doing that.s, ect.&lt;br /&gt;»What does it smell like after you rinse it out?&lt;br /&gt;Sulfur, but I only noticed it when I pressed my nose to my hair. The next morning it was almost unnoticeable even when doing that.</li>
            <li> You will stilled be charged shipping three times, which makes no sense to me as they have probably all been put in one package that didn&#x27;t cost $15 to ship. Just ordered and can&#x27;t comment on the quality, I have been using another brand of henna that works great and thought I&#x27;d see if this one could make my hair even redder... I&#x27;ve been using the Nupur brand at $4 a a package with free shipping, so unless this brand is considerably better, I&#x27;ll stick with the $4 package of henna.  Will update after I get my $28 worth of henna!</li>
            <li> Let me preface by saying I will be coming back over the next 2 weeks to a month to update this review as I just dyed my hair last night. I was extremely scared to use this product after reading all the recent reviews, all were horrible from 2014. I even tried to get a refund and stop the transaction, but the henna arrived at my house a few hours later so not much could be done. After using this, I would say that this is a good product, but you have to take the right steps!!! I did a little more research online, so this was my procedure: 1 and a half cups purified water for 100 grams of product and 1/4 organic lemon juice (or the juice of 2 organic lemons). I mixed the ingredients and sealed it in a bowl, let it sit in the refrigerator for 4 hours. Yes, I said 4 hours! This is only if you&#x27;re planning to use it that day, you can always just let it sit overnight. I then carefully applied the pudding-like mixture to my hair and let it sit for once again, 4 hours. I washed my hair about 4 times, twice with shampoo, once with conditioner and all over again...my hair continued to bleed, but it was a very, very light yellow color and my scalp was beginning to hurt so I stopped. Oddly enough, I could see the color lightly on my finger tips after running them through my hair, but it did not stain my pillow case! My main worry after reading the horrible reviews was that my hair would constantly be bleeding, some people wrote of ruining their towels and shirts. Remember that red hair dye no matter if it&#x27;s synthetic or natural, will always come out the quickest. This product is henna and crushed hibiscus flowers, you can always soak your hair in hibiscus tea to boost the natural red tint of your hair; just don&#x27;t buy this product thinking it&#x27;s going to stay in your hair like black box dye. Like I said though, I believe a lot of the people leaving the horrible reviews didn&#x27;t use the product correctly.</li>
            <li> This Henna right here does everything it claims to do!  I applied it to my sister&#x27;s hair and she&#x27;s had nothing but compliments!  I will definitely order more!  I love this product!  It delivers every time!</li>
            <li> I have to say...the smell of this product and the 2-3 hour wait for the color may suck, but the results of the color is totally worth it...however...this dye bleeds a lot.</li>
            <li> Left stains on my pillow cases and towels every time i got my hair wet, if you are a first time henna user (they don&#x27;t tell you this on here of course) but you need to apply it twice for it to go red, and if you have long hair they say you have to use the whole packet. First application left my roots the desired red and everything else orange, some spots were even a blackish color... I tried again and it didn&#x27;t dye my hair at all. I left it on for 5 hours and my hair remained all sorts of weird orange and red colors. I took a bath and washed my hair in the tub, when I got out the water was a tea color and when I looked at my hair, the red had faded considerable amount. In short, I don&#x27;t think henna is for me.</li>
            <li> I will be writing an update to this report when I reapply the henna another time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am one of those chemical hair dye junkies that routinely dyed her hair all the colors of the rainbow. While most of the semi-permanent dyes were vegetable based dyes, I still utilized quite a bit of the other chemical dyes as well as a good quantity of strong bleach. After attempting to go platinum blond from dark brown (what the heck was I thinking??) I gave up after two bleaches because it was just getting to be too hard to go from one end of the spectrum to the other without paying a good chunk of money at the salon to have them do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I decided that I would like to let my hair grow out (it&#x27;s at my shoulders now) and attempt to still enjoy dying my hair. I read up on henna and decided I would give it a try (the prospect of it repairing my hair even a little bit was appealing). So.. I did. I ordered this product and made it up in a mixing bowl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It should be noted that I think if you have hair that comes to your shoulder or longer, you are probably going to need more henna than the one package as I barely had enough to cover my hair. Perhaps I could have thinned it out some more, but it didn&#x27;t seem like a good idea. It was a lot of fun to mix (like playing with mud!). I coated my hair, enjoyed the faint hay smell that reminded me of my home in the Midwest and waited.. for three hours (as is on the package directions).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rinsed it out (which took awhile because well.. it&#x27;s like having caked mud in your hair) and then I conditioned my hair (to be on the safe side because I had previously bleached my hair in an attempt to strip some of the chemicals from my hair). When I stepped out of the shower, my hair was bright orange! I don&#x27;t mean ginger red or a strawberry blond/red.. I mean neon orange!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was not aware that I would have to reapply the henna more than once to get the deep red shade I want. I almost thought they had sent me the wrong package for how orange my hair was. Now while I (and apparently half the people here) think my orange hair is really freaking cool, it was not the result I was expecting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I would say, if you have really blond hair (which parts of my hair were), or have dyed your hair with chemicals... do not be surprised if your hair turns orange the first time you use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be fair, it did leave my hair feeling better once I applied conditioner on top of the henna and no, it does not still smell like hay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any event, I want to be fair and retry this stuff a few more times because I find myself oddly addicted to the fun I have mixing it and the fact that it smells like nature, even if I didn&#x27;t get the desired color.me the wrong package for how orange my hair was.

            <li> I bought almost 10  different color from The Henna Guys. I love the product a lot. I tried different colors and all of them worked very well. Also my hair looked shiner and got volume. I am very pleased with this particular brand because I have tried henna before from different sellers but did not have the  same positive experience.&lt;br /&gt;And I gave 5 stars because their customer service is as great as their product. I had some shipment problem  because USPS and they solved it with very professional manner even though it was not their fault. They sent me the missing package with a gift, and they charge me nothing!</li>
            <li> This is the worst product ever! And I followed it to a T and I read the reviews before purchasing, it pulled my hair out and I hadda wash it like 10 times to get it out and the color didn&#x27;t even take to my roots! I wanted to give it no stars, but it won&#x27;t let me :(</li>
            <li> I have virgin naturally wavy, mixed raced hair, and because of this, the color took very well! It took a long time to rinse. It was still bleeding after at least 50 rinses and a good soaking, very light yellow like urine, but I dried it and will follow up in 48 hours with a wash. The results are amazing. This is the first time I have ever dyed my hair and I love it! I have read there are others who do not care for this dye but I see no problems! Thanks Henna Guys for making my first ever henna experience a wonder.</li>
            <li> This was my first experience with henna. I was really pleased.&lt;br /&gt;I thought my husband hated it, as it was a pretty shocking change.&lt;br /&gt;So, I go to Lush at the mall and got a cacao red to brown it up at bit. The girls at Lush loved my color.&lt;br /&gt;I came home and mixed up the henna. Well, what a mess!!!! It immediately turned to clumps of wet grass on my hair. (Then he tells me he liked it the way it was. Arrrg!)&lt;br /&gt;It went everywhere! It also took the whole amout of product to cover my short hair. I&#x27;m sitting for three hours with it on right now.&lt;br /&gt;The Henna product from this Amazon site was easy to apply and clean up. The mall henna was all over my bathroom. Yuck!&lt;br /&gt;So, if you&#x27;re looking for bright shiny red hair, this is a great product.</li>
            <li> Yes the package finally came have no clue as to why it would take practically a month for a 2 day delivery? The product itself is wonderful though but it does have the aroma of burnt licorice candy which I don&#x27;t mind in the least bit....</li>
            <li> I just purchased this product and have had it on my hair for three days now.  When I applied it I thought i might have problems because I had 1-2 inches gown out and ends that had been colored many times.  The henna covered everything including grays.  Much more vibrant than I thought, but still fine for a regular look.  The three packets I got will last me for at least a year.  Much healthier hair, would never go back to chemical color.  Shipping arrived much faster than expected.  Left on my head for two hours and that was plenty.  Great product, recommend!</li>
            <li> I have been a henna user for quite sometime now and I keep trying different brands because I hadn&#x27;t found one that I was really happy with. I can say, this is my favorite thus far. It is not 100% henna, but it is 100% natural and that is all that really matters to me. The package arrived quickly, included instructions and gloves. The color turned out lovely. It is a darker red than I normally use and at first I wasn&#x27;t sure I loved the color. But anyone who has used henna before knows that the color changes over a few days and washings. It is a lovely auburn color after a week or two and I am very happy with it. I would definitely.recommend this henna!</li>
            <li> Absolutely Perfect and just what the previous reviews said!  First application was bright but beautiful, second darkened it to exactly the red auburn I was aiming for and I disagree about &amp;#34;drying the hair out&amp;#34;.  My hair has never felt more healthy and soft!  It was fun to do (a bit messy but life is short people, enjoy the journey!) and I really appreciated that I&#x27;ve found a way to feel pretty without a million chemicals I can&#x27;t pronounce!!!  I highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> I love the results!!  And that its all natural!!  I&#x27;ve had comments made that it looks like I have red sparkling tinsel in my hair!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure how to rank this product. The color is beautiful, the product is smooth and easy to use, but it bleeds and bleeds and bleeds! I had used pure henna a few years ago on chemically-treated hair with permanent results that didn&#x27;t bleed. I have been using this dye over also chemically-treated hair, and it bleeds and fades with no end in sight. I went five weeks between my third and fourth dye job, and it continued to bleed and fade any time my hair got damp.  Even some reviewers with virgin hair are reporting the bleeding and acting like that is normal for henna dyes. That has not been my experience with pure henna in the past. Perhaps it is the hibiscus that is running bright yellow in my shower and staining my towels green?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will probably switch back to a pure henna to try to stop the bleeding, but if my hair still bleeds I will happily upgrade my rating of this product. If pure henna bleeds, I will assume the problem is my hair!</li>
            <li> I have been using henna dye on my hair for almost a year now. Prior to trying the Deep/Dark Red from the Henna Guys, I was using a different brand, which I liked, but was more expensive. I decided to try the Henna Guys out on a whim and ended up LOVING IT. The color is so vibrant, but still appropriate for most work situations. It is much more red than the other product I used (which gave my hair more of a natural gingery color) and fades beautifully over time. It will not make you look like a natural red head on any level, but at the same time it is not overly unnatural. I have gotten so many compliments, from the first day I had it in to a month + afterwards. The only issue I&#x27;ve had is that the color bleeds (and continues bleeding well into the third and fourth week). However, although it does color my towels, it does not permanently stain them. I would definitely recommend this product and will continue using it.</li>
            <li> I loved the color, but it is super messy. Not sure I would try it again.</li>
            <li> The color is bright and beautiful exactly what I was looking for. For a few days after,  your hair may feel a little rough but it goes away after a few washes. My hair now feels soft luscious and thicker. The color does bleed a bit, but it stops after about a week or so...the beautiful color and feel outweighs that con... Mine didn&#x27;t  bleed as much as other user&#x27;s seem to report, however it may be because I use sulfate free organic shampoo and always wash my hair with cool water. I&#x27;ve received a lot of compliments about the color and shine.  Very satisfied and will continue to use this color!</li>
            <li> I ordered this product, and received it 3 days later with regular shipping. At first, I was very reluctant because I had never used henna before. Let me tell you, the color came out super red! My hair has been dyed in the past so it did not come out as super red as it did on my roots. If you had dyed hair like mine, I had a red and brown put, it will come out a deep red close to a burgundy color. The dye came in 3.5 oz, which is twice as much as store bought henna and it&#x27;s for a lower cost! I love the results and I will be for sure ordering again!</li>
            <li> It wasnt what I suspected</li>
            <li> I bought this product and at first the color turned out AMAZING!  However, it took forever to complete the first rinse and my hair continues to bleed out well over a week later.  Also, the product said that henna was a natural conditioner.  My hair came out feeling like straw and completely unmanageable.  I had to deep condition to get my hair back to normal.  The color continues to fade and I sincerely hope that it fades out completely.  My hair looks terrible now.  Never going to use or recommend this product ever again.  Just give me the good stuff from Sally&#x27;s and I will deal with the chemicals.</li>
            <li> I have been dying my hair for years with chemical dyes and bleaches, so much so my hair broke off and i had to cut it super short and gave up dying it, but i dont like my natural color much and the itch to dye it hit hard and so I decided to give henna a shot. It was really worth it, easy to mix and somewhat a pain to apply. i left it on for 3 hours and got a beautiful color from it, though i know it will darken over the next few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was not difficult to wash out, just fill the bathtub, and move your head around to loosen it up, then run your hands through it for a bit, then turn the shower on condition and rinse again. After that rinse in cold water to seal it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair feels super soft, even the ends which were slightly dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have maybe 3-4 inch long hair and used 100G, so I used WAY to much, but I also have thick hair. I imagine as I get used to doing it I wont need to use so much.</li>
            <li> I like the color. The process for dying the hair was to long. 4 hours I wasn&#x27;t expecting. Turned out perfect. Fast shipment. Nothing wrong with the product. I just wont buy again. To much work for me. I would rather pay a professional.</li>
            <li> When I&#x27;m out women want to know what product i am using on my hair. I will be ordering again really soon.</li>
            <li> I was questionable on whether I wanted to try this color of red because it looked too vibrant for me. After reading a couple reviews of people who sounded like they had similar color hair (A medium to darker brown), I got some. And the results were amazing! My hair is a very deep red like the product says. It&#x27;s not as bright as the picture because I don&#x27;t have blonde hair but it will definitely be a very pretty natural-looking red. It is also noticeably softer and my ends do look healthier. Thanks Henna Guys.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with the purchase of this Henna. I used it today. It has a very smooth consistency no clumps or anything. It was easy to apply and because of the smooth consistency I was able to color my whole head. The color is absolutely fabulous. This is the best Henna I have ever used. I will definitely be purchasing again when it&#x27;s time for a touch up :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty experienced with using henna to dye my hair and i usually use Rainbow brand, which works wonderfully. Unlike Rainbow, however, this henna was somehow much messier to use; it dried out into dust during application and got *everywhere,* immediately staining everything it came into contact with. Also, the results stayed vibrant for only about five days before the color started fading dramatically. Now, a few weeks later, the only thing that has remained anywhere near the color i started with is the hair on near my roots; everything else has faded out. I&#x27;m used to keeping a vibrant, consistent color for much longer with Rainbow brand, and when it does fade, it&#x27;s much more subtle and pleasant-looking. This might be *slightly* cheaper, but it&#x27;s worth the few extra dollars to buy Rainbow henna directly from [...] , or here on Amazon or Puritan&#x27;s Pride.</li>
            <li> I purchased this on March 10th and it arrived on March 20th. I saw online that people recommend using a red berry tea and that worked really well for me. The application was super messy and I had to have someone help me. I used vasaline around my hairline and my forehead to prevent any harsh staining. I DID get some orange stains on my forehead but after washing my face it went away almost completely and was barely visible, but still visible. My hair was a dark ash brown and now is a wonderful deep red and it looks amazing! One thing i noticed is you can barely notice any colour in photos, but in natural light it looks stunning. Since application IS really difficult there are changes in colour throughout your hair, but it looks more like highlights then anything. I have super short hair (sides are about an inch and a half and top is about five inches) and i still had some left over after so if you have longer hair please get two! Other then that I love my hair now and I get so many compliments!</li>
            <li> ok, so i&#x27;ve only dyed my hair a handful of times in my life, and i&#x27;ve never been terribly pleased with the results, and it always fades completely by 2-3 weeks.  I bought this henna in January, and I just got around to using it yesterday.  I read a lot of online tutorials about henna in general, to get some pointers because this stuff is somewhat of an undertaking.  I found some really good advice.  First, you should probably mix this with some apple cider vinegar or something acidic because it helps release the chemicals in henna that dye your hair.  so, i used some apple cider vinegar (make sure it is unfiltered with the mother, because otherwise it won&#x27;t have all the nutritional benefits) and some HOT water.  i used a packet and a half, mixed in a metal bowl, and this worked perfectly.  i mixed it to a mash potato consistency, covered it with plastic wrap, and went to work, because i read online that you needed to let henna sit for 12 hours to be ready to use.  that&#x27;s not necessary with this mix.  it&#x27;s ready right away.  when i got back, i added a little more vinegar, hot water, and a little almond oil to get it to a yogurt consistency so it would be pasty enough to apply, but thick enough so it didn&#x27;t run everywhere.  this was an excellent idea!  i have long, strawberry blond hair, so i separated it into sections, and got my boyfriend to help me.  i put a black towel down and got in the bathtub.  be sure to wear gloves also, this stuff stains IMMEDIATELY.  also, applying vaseline to your hairline, neck, and ears is a really good trick to keep it from staining there.  it just wipes off.  next, we wrapped my head in plastic wrap (the cling type works best) and put on a shower cap, and went to watch a movie.  i put a black towel behind my head, cuz some \\&quot;mud\\&quot; will inevitably escape, and i didn&#x27;t want to stain anything.  three hours later, i rinsed out with shampoo and conditioner (i know some people say not to, but it was fine) and my hair was RED.  like vampire red.  WAY redder than i was anticipating.  the package says it will tone down in the next few days, and i certainly hope so, because i&#x27;m not sure my boss will be thrilled.  i like it though.  also, it&#x27;s my last week at that job, so who cares.  after my hair dried, it was so soft and shiny.  way healthier than any time i used normal dyes.  it seriously feels like spider silk.  it still smells somewhat, but i&#x27;ll live.  i would definitely use this product again.  here&#x27;s the link to the tutorial i found most helpful: [...]</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using henna for over a year. The other company i was with before only had a few colors. My hair was already a reddish tint &amp; i had always wanted to go redder. This definitely didn&#x27;t disappoint! It&#x27;s a beautiful, rich deep red &amp; my hair feels like heaven!! They definitely have a dedicated customer with me.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Makes me hair the exact color I want without the harsh effects or smell of normal hair dye. Definitely will purchase again.</li>
            <li> The dark red gives absolutely gorgeous color for the first 2 weeks but has been leaching out with every wash like crazy :(( I&#x27;ve tried it twice but I&#x27;ve never used a henna that bled out so badly before and I&#x27;ve been using it for eight years. Cold water washing didn&#x27;t help either. I will NOT be using this again.</li>
            <li> Does not stay in hair for long and takes for even to process. Great if you are going all natural, though.</li>
            <li> I am an avid henna user, I dye my hair with regular pure henna about every 3 months. I decided to try this out because I was sick of my hair being two-tone (brown inside and red in the sun), so this seemed like a good idea. The description says it will not change the color or your darker hair, but unless you have stark black hair, this usually isn&#x27;t true, so I went with it. You mix it with just water, and you apparently don&#x27;t need to let the henna oxidize like you would normally, according to the instructions. If you have never dyed with henna before, go to hennaforhair.com, it&#x27;s an amazing site with all kinds of tips and instructions. Henna can be difficult to apply but the benefits are so very worth it. The instructions on this package also say to leave it in for only 2-3 hrs, which is significantly shorter than you should leave in pure henna. So, I applied it to my head, put a shower cap on (you can also use saran wrap, works just as well) and went and did some housework for 3 hrs. Then I went to rinse it out (buy cheap conditioner for this process you will need it) and then blow dried it so I could see what it looked like dry. What I came out with is a very dark but very noticeable pink. Not a red that could be seen as a pink, but obviously pink. I don&#x27;t know exactly why this happened, it might be because my hair was already hennaed, but I can&#x27;t imagine why that would be an issue. After rinsing, the color ran really bad for a while, ruined a towel, so use one you can throw away. They tell you to shampoo within 24 to 48 hrs from treatment to stop the color run. It seemed to have stopped a bit, but the running doesn&#x27;t seem to take away from the color very much. I&#x27;m not going to lie, the pink is pretty, but I&#x27;m not ready for that kind of commitment. I have some indigo powder that I will mix with the next 100g and see if it will come out a darker color (hopefully a red/brown). The ingredients listed are lawsonialnermis Linn, and Hisbiscus (hibiscus) Powder (for thered color).</li>
            <li> Love the hair dye!  My daughters hair looks great with it in.  HOWever, remember you can&#x27;t use anything other product on your hair, no other dye but henna, and no perms... IT SMOKES.</li>
            <li> i love my results the color is good im not a fan of red but i am now love it</li>
            <li> I am completely addicted to The Henna Guys! I have been coloring my hair with them for about a year now and get compliments all the time; even from stylists. It is also really important to me that this is a chemical free product that conditions my hair rather than damaging it like tradition hair dyes. I love it so much that I have converted my sister and mother to using The Henna Guys too!</li>
            <li> I love henna! and I love getting my henna from The Henna Guys! great sellers with great high quality henna! highly reccommended!</li>
            <li> I bought this with much anticipation and was hoping that my hair would turn a beautiful shade with red highlights and a nice sheen over my black hair and it did. What I don&#x27;t like is the constant bleeding of color onto my hands, neck, and clothes throughout the day (it&#x27;s been two months now since the application). I&#x27;ve used regular &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; henna before even applying indigo for blackness in my hair and never had this issue. Who knows? Maybe I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m doing (I followed the directions on the package to the letter), but at this point, I&#x27;m not satisfied with it. I can&#x27;t wait until it&#x27;s all washed out so I can apply either henna/indigo or go the chemical route and see a stylist which might be the way to go for me. That way, I won&#x27;t have to be concerned with bleeding.</li>
            <li> Very reasonably priced. Worked beautifully, I followed the instructions and my hair turned out perfect, I love my new color.</li>
            <li> I have previously used Henna on my hair, but it was Jamila Henna body art quality. It took 12 hours to dye release, left a copper color and smelled VERY strongly of hay for WEEKS. So, I decided to try this stuff, to see if it was any better. My hair was growing out from the Jamila when I ordered this, so my roots were several inches of dirty blonde, with the rest being a coppery red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Deep Red Henna from this seller evenly changed it all, so you can&#x27;t even tell my hair was multiple colors to start. It is already dye released, so just add water and slop it onto your head. So much easier! And it doesn&#x27;t smell anywhere near as strongly, I added a couple of drops of essential oils to it when mixing with water and it took out about 80% of the smell. Just a faint hint left, my hair products easily covers that up. The color nearly matches the stock photo color, which I was surprised about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only downside is the same as with all henna - it&#x27;s MESSY when you wash it out. I let the water run clear, then combed my hair out, washed again for good measure and my hair was still leaking orange all over the place. Wear something you don&#x27;t mind getting stained when you apply and be VERY careful for a day or two afterwards, to make sure all the orange is out, or you will stain your clothes/towels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, if you have naturally curled hair - this WILL relax your curls a bit. All Henna does. It also reduces frizz for mine. This is a pro for some, a con for others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wait 1-2 days to shampoo my hair after Henna, to make sure I don&#x27;t cause loss of color before it&#x27;s fully set.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to using straight up BAQ henna to dye my hair, which produces a very bright, orangey color (think of Lucille Ball).  The last time I colored my hair, I was looking for something that would give me a darker, deeper red color, but was still all-natural - and this seemed like a great choice.  It got such good reviews and the price was right, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  Here&#x27;s my honest feedback:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE PROS:  The color is absolutely stunning, no kidding.  On my medium brown hair, I got a rich, deep red, and I got a lot of really great compliments on it.  The directions on the packet were clear, and I followed them to the letter.  I did not find application to be difficult - but then again, I have a lot of experience with putting henna in my hair.  There is a bit of a learning curve with that, but there are some pretty good instructional videos on YouTube if you are worried about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE CONS:  Biggest drawback with this product is the runoff/bleeding.  I wash my hair every day, and it was still bleeding over a month later... and that is no exaggeration. This was somewhat of an embarrassment for me because I unfortunately dyed my hair over the summer... which means that every time I sweated or went swimming - you guessed it, I had rivulets of orange dripping down my neck and face.  Word to the wise: if you&#x27;re going to use this product, put a towel or old pillowcase over your pillow before you go to sleep, because this WILL stain your pillowcases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, the cons outweigh the pros, and I will not be buying this again.</li>
            <li> Itsba great product looks a little nasty wen its all put together but in all it is a great product and I will deffinetly be back</li>
            <li> Great Product. The color lasts a long time. The color looks good. Easy to apply. I would recommend to others.</li>
            <li> I am giving this product three stars mainly because I contacted the Henna Guys with questions about the product on the day that I was going to apply it to my hair. No one responded to my question. I am also giving this product three stars because I still had little to no color after the second application, even after subsituting water for red zinger tea which is suppose to deepen the tone of the color. I am not sure I will purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> I love these guys. The henna came way faster then I thought I have read most the reviews and it seems positive I wil right a nother one tonight when finished. I don&#x27;t the mess or smell so much better for your hair then all the chemical ones I hope it comes ut red have tried  three others and I am not getting the red I wnt</li>
            <li> It could have worked better. I&#x27;m guessing it was because my hair is so dark and all of it was natural. the ends were still bleached from a long time ago and it showed up better there. Followed all the steps and added extra to it. All it did was leave a small red tint to my hair and dyed all of my belongings. I didn&#x27;t really like having to sleep for a month with a plastic bag on my head. even with my hair dry it left everything dyed orange. I think I&#x27;ll stick to my natural hair rather than dye my whole house orange</li>
            <li> This was the first time I have colored my hair with Henna, I have very dry, damaged hair from previous colored products ( dark brown ) and thought what do I have to lose. I searched every where for henna, and from someone that would have 100% Henna. Which this company did. They also had a wide range of shades to choose from. Which I thought was great. As a first time user of the product I will say I will never go back. Very fast shipping, and decently priced. I will continue to buy from this company. I would say the color is very true, A beautiful Deep Red.</li>
            <li> I loved the color that developed after a few washes. The color did not last and the application process got a little messy. Take extra care to not get on any porcelain. I was not able to remove the stains!</li>
            <li> I have used henna hair dye before and this is one of the better brands.&lt;br /&gt;All henna sucks to apply but I have to disagree with most of the reviewers on the smell level - I didn&#x27;t notice an odor to this brand while the last brand I used definitely had an odor.&lt;br /&gt;It did take about 2/3 of the package to color my short bob hair because I have really thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;It also takes about 30 minutes to wash out.&lt;br /&gt;My hair feels soft and looks shiny. I hope the color will darken in the next 48 hours.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend The Henna Guys.</li>
            <li> Made my hair feel heavy for days and it really dried it out.</li>
            <li> This was my first experience with Henna and I have to say I absolutely loved this product and the way it turned out on chemically colored hair.  I have bought more since and will stay with this company in the future.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have been using chemical dyes for over 20 years. As a raw vegan, I knew it was time to ditch the chemicals but was not happy with past henna results....or with the idea of embracing the grey.  I just rinsed this henna out of my hair about 2 hours ago and am so happy with the color.  My previous color was a brown/red with lots of grey.  I was worried because of previous dyes and hennas that the color would turn out bad.  Instead, I have an intense red with wine highlights.  Also, my hair feels thick and looks shiny, even without conditioner!  For those looking for a natural red, this might be too bright.  However, this company offers lots of colors to choose from.  I will update if the color changes at all.  As of now, I am really happy!</li>
            <li> Loves it but it leaked every time it got wet it stained towels and shirts and ut did not last as long as splat</li>
            <li> This is a really great color and I am happy with it.</li>
            <li> This brand was my first ever henna application on previously chemically dyed hair. When I first applied it (I got the color Auburn), the result came out SUPER firetruck red (I&#x27;m a natural blonde, and my hair was a little red from the previous dye job)-- which I read was pretty normal. Over a few days, it darkened to a nicer, darker cherry color; however, it didn&#x27;t last long. I discovered my hair was bleeding orange in the shower, and with a few more showers after that, I realized the color was gradually fading.&lt;br /&gt;After reading around, I discovered this wash out problem was generally common among people with previously chemically dyed hair. When I applied this brand of henna a second time around late November, same color and amount with a little more added ingredients, I was more satisfied with the result. The more you dye your hair with henna, the darker the outcome color, and this was my case. I thought the beautiful dark red color would stay at least a little better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, to this day, my hair is still bleeding orange in the shower... not sure if it&#x27;s an error on my part or if it&#x27;s the brand&#x27;s fault or simply if this is normal, but the color fades with each shower I take. When I dyed it late November for the second time, it was a dark cherry color; now, it&#x27;s a duller, copper-y red/orange/brown shade. I feel like I&#x27;m missing something here... quite disappointing, really... maybe I should try another color.</li>
            <li> I love it!!! It turned out perfect. Not nearly as red in the picture, but still very beautiful. It covered the grey great.</li>
            <li> Short version: I love love love this product. I found it easy to apply and the color turned out lovely (pretty much like the pictures). The smell wasn&#x27;t that bad and it went away in less than a day. I also didn&#x27;t experience any color run. I would highly recommend this product to anyone wanting to use a natural, non-toxic hair dye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Longer version: I have naturally brown hair and the color turned out a deep burgundy. If you have blonde hair I would imagine the color would turn out a more vibrant red. I have fairly short hair and used about half of the henna (~50g). I mixed the henna with a spice tea water and fresh lemon juice. Before applying the henna I rinsed my hair with an apple cider vinegar and water mixture to naturally strip it of oils. Don&#x27;t think this is necessary but I read somewhere it helps the color adhere to your hair. I found the mixture really easy to apply. I recommend gloves. I used a shower cap with a hole cut in the top (exactly the directions state) to cover my head and left it for 6 hours. I rinsed with warm water and then cold to help set the color. Didn&#x27;t even need conditioner as my hair felt so healthy already. Went to bed with my hair wet and not even one mark on my pillowcase :). I&#x27;m assuming the people complaining of color running didn&#x27;t rinse the henna out completely. As for the smell, I didn&#x27;t find it so bad. A mix between green tea and hay. Beats the strong ammonia and chemical smell from conventional hair dye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re thinking about buying this product, do it!</li>
            <li> I have never written an Amazon review. However, I HAD to write a review about this henna hair color. I AM IN LOVE! After years of dying my hair and spending hundreds of dollars on professional color, I  am so happy to have found this! The color is beautiful, a perfect red, giving my espresso hair a cherry cola color. It also makes my hair super soft and shiny! The best hair product ever!</li>
            <li> An easy, natural red hair dye. A little orange on the first dye....but enough for about 3 hair dies a week apart.</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast,got to me in a week (:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very damaged (bleach queen) hair and I was praying that it would actually work and it did! I followed the directions that came with. This was over a few months ago and I still have traces of red in my hair. However,  due to me having the extremely damaged hair, it faded quick but that&#x27;s only because my hair isn&#x27;t healthy at all. I will buy from this seller again and am very excited to see how it would look on my new growing healthy hair! This product  works great on light hair!  :D</li>
            <li> A little pricey but I love the color! So vibrant and bright. It bleeds in every wash though. And fades to orange....will still buy though because it doesn&#x27;t kill my hair. And I recommend if you&#x27;re pregnant or just dont want chemicals on your body. Goes on like mud. Dries like mud...but so worth it when its rinsed out and finished! Buy it! I don&#x27;t reccomend going swimming for a couple months  after you use this!</li>
            <li> Wonderful comments on this product so I decided to to purchase; it is a great quality Henna and the color true to picture!!  I will purchase again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a natural light blonde that died my hair red at a salon once before using this product. I knew the henna was pretty permanent so I wanted to test out the idea of red before I committed. I liked being red and wanted a natural look, so I ordered some caca rouge from lush. The thing is, from the looks of things, caca rouge was a little too ginger-y for my taste so I also got this stuff to use with it. I waited 4 weeks after my initial salon dye before applying the henna and had been washing my hair with warm/hot water to ensure the original dye faded a fair amount so I could get the best possible color. I had previously done my research and did NOT follow the instructions that came with the product because I wanted a very vibrant color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So here&#x27;s what I did: I used 2 pieces of caca rouge to the one packet of deep red henna. I chopped the caca rouge as small as I could before melting. When I melted it, I used boiling dark red tea and mixed slowly with the caca rouge and other henna together. When it was all melty and the right consistency, I covered it with a damp paper towel and I let it sit in the fridge for 6 hours to let the henna release it&#x27;s color. When I removed it, I slowly re-melted it with steam and applied it directly to my hair. I originally wanted to mix two separate sets of henna so my blond roots would match the rest of my hair, but I&#x27;m lazy and figured it would be fine, so I applied it as close to my roots as a could and covered the length of my hair. I wrapped it in cling wrap and slept with it on, so I had it on for at least 8 hours or more before I rinsed it out. The final result was PERFECT. The ginger for the caca rouge mixed wonderfully with my other henna and made for a very natural fiery dark red and made a great gradient with my roots. I totally love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some notes: it&#x27;s messy. Very, very messy. I suggest putting a mirror in your tub and doing it there for faster clean up. But unlike the other reviews I&#x27;ve read online,henna really doesn&#x27;t smell bad at all. Maybe it was my mix of two hennas or my very fragrant red tea but I had no problem with the smell at all. It smelled like tea and flowers. My husband (who is the king of being overly sensitive to smell) even said it didn&#x27;t smell bad. For removal when you&#x27;re finished, avoid shampoo. Conditioner is your friend. Rinse as much out as you can with plain water and then work the conditioner in from root to tip to help the grains slip out of your hair. Shampoo just made it more difficult to remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as longevity, I didn&#x27;t wash my hair for 48 hours afterward and have washed it in warm water with color safe hair products once. There was some red in my water as I washed but the overall color seems fine. It&#x27;s been about 3 weeks since my initial dye and my hair still looks awesome even with washing with hot water. I love that this stuff is organic and free of magnetic salts. This stuff is officially my favorite henna dye. You have a new loyal customer. :-)</li>
