            <li>Easy to use excellent product!</li>
            <li>how good job I did.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say I am as good as a hairstylist Lon doing my hair</li>
            <li>Shiny and gorgeous hair locks can do that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>Instyler Max Rotating Iron is a gorgeous piece of hardware</li>
            <li>I think this product is good for people who want that curved in look.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m also not at all impressed by the cheap construction of the iron.</li>
            <li>To buy a. Abdapter  good idea to put shield on it as I burnt my forehead</li>
            <li>Using a straightener takes me a good hour</li>
            <li>The original was wonderful.</li>
            <li>The Max is beautiful, love the purple, but it does nothing for my hair.</li>
            <li>Love it, very important to watch the videos and U tube posts for tips to get the best results.</li>
            <li>However, I am very impressed and satisfied with this product for many reasons:  </li>
            <li>This is the best iron that I have used and it is definitely worth the price I paid for it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very smooth!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very sure that the problem wasn&#x27;t from my power bar.</li>
            <li>I was set and done and most importantly……super happy with the results.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>This one is so much better!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>Okay, I get it!</li>
            <li>I needed something to straighten my hair and it works better than anything I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
            <li>I Love it!</li>
            <li>Outstanding product!</li>
            <li>I love this product !</li>
            <li>but I love it!</li>

            <li>Love!  </li>

            <li>Love!  </li>
            <li>I love this thing!</li>
            <li>great and easy to use thank you InStyer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and I have always had great results.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and does a great job.</li>
            <li>and it did not leave a nice finished product.</li>
            <li>While that seems like it would be a nice feature, there were times when it would change direction</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has body and the nice under flip I want!&lt;br</li>
            <li>wish they made 2 kind of voltage 110&amp;220</li>
            <li>I’m a cut-it-off before it singes my scalp kind of gal.</li>
            <li>I’m a cut-it-off before it singes my scalp kind of gal.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t rotate two ways as promised and it doesn&#x27;t by any means get ethnic hair as nicely coiffed as it claims.</li>
            <li>It gives me nice shape around my face</li>
            <li>and she just so happen to own a InStyler.</li>
            <li>Nice product and</li>
            <li>From the videos touting how easily and quickly you can have flawless shiny hairstyles</li>
            <li>Let it be known that I have the original Instyler and love it!!</li>
            <li>Very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>THe product seems to be genuine and was made from really good material.</li>
            <li>Not the greatest hair appliance I&#x27;ve ever used, by far.</li>
            <li>The smooth styles you create will remain gorgeous without damaging your hair.</li>
            <li>:) makes my hair look nice</li>
            <li>By far the best curling iron on the market</li>
            <li>Wow, WORKS GREAT!</li>
            <li>Good and fast shipping!!!</li>
            <li>And it is really EASY to use!</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair between my chin and shoulder.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so easy!  </li>
            <li>I  like it but not as good as the original</li>
            <li>I loved the original.</li>
            <li>I had the original InStyler and LOVED it.  </li>
            <li>I used it at a friends house when I didn&#x27;t have my curling iron and thought it was good at curling my ends under without giving me full curls</li>
            <li>Love how easy it is to use!</li>
            <li>The way it is made is very cheap like, but besides that it just didn&#x27;t work for us.</li>
            <li>It made my hair very smooth and shiny.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad that I invested the money in it.  </li>
            <li>so probably my rating would be 5 stars if I were more efficient in using it.</li>
            <li>but I sure have gotten tons of compliments on styling job I did.</li>
            <li>This Get Instyler is my favorite and a life saver.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li>Love LOVE LOVE THIS.</li>
            <li>Just get it don&#x27;t question it and try for yourself you will love it.</li>
            <li>With this one I felt like I needed to test it before each section to make sure I knew which way it was rotating.</li>
            <li>and I love how smooth and shiny my hair is after using it!</li>
            <li>Love the lift and straightening I get with it.</li>
            <li>It was better than nothing.</li>
            <li>If it can help my dreary head of hair, it should be able to help just about anyone.  </li>
            <li>She end up almost liking this more</li>
            <li>I get better results.</li>
            <li>With the Instyler I can have the same hair perfect hairstyle every time!</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say I love it</li>
            <li>I LOVE mine</li>
            <li>Love this soooo</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t describe how much I love this.</li>
            <li>Makes curling way better experience.</li>
            <li>Okay, it knows me and knows I don’t like to wait.</li>
            <li>why I don’t style my hair like this more often.</li>
            <li>’s day comes, telling myself I better use them because I have to justify the purchase……</li>
            <li>’s day comes, telling myself I better use them because I have to justify the purchase……</li>
            <li>It can give some volume but mostly just gives you a bump in your hair.</li>
            <li>OK just wish</li>
            <li>ut had more heat settings than one at this price.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I thought the product would work much better than it</li>
            <li>Except for the barrel it&#x27;s mostly plastic.</li>
            <li>I love that this rolls both way.  </li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>I purchased this product for a friends after many years of wanting an InStyler.</li>
            <li>maybe it works better when I have longer hair.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair so healthy looking</li>
            <li>Let me start by saying that Vocalpoint provided me with free products in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li>I think it is an appliance that will work for some, but for me, I&#x27;ve got better things.  </li>
            <li>I was able to get a bit of flip on the ends of his hair.  </li>
            <li>suggest if you can, try it before buying, or make sure you can return it, in case you are like me, and your hair just sits and spins on it without doing anything.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you buy the Instyler, be sure to start with a layer of hair that you won&#x27;t mind having to cut off.</li>
            <li>The longer I use it the better I get with it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>For my hair I think a heated brush (like a Calista Tools  brand) would be better.</li>
            <li>I absolutely loved it at first.  </li>
            <li>I think it is no doubt best for girls with long hair.</li>
            <li>I loved it so much!</li>
            <li>I love this product, it feels great on my hair leaving it soft and shinny.</li>
            <li>But other than that this is a wonderful product :3</li>
            <li>It just gives a final look that makes it look like you tried to straighten your hair, but didn&#x27;t do a very good job at it....</li>
            <li>Since then I&#x27;d dreamed of being able to do that myself, and figured this product would show me the light.</li>
            <li>I am so happy that I bought this and threw my old hair iron out.</li>
            <li>The curling attachment it comes with works great as well making my hair have volume and natural looking curls.</li>
            <li>To straight is good too</li>
            <li>love this iron, easy to use, hair become smooth and silky</li>
            <li>Bought the max because it rotates both ways, I bought the original two years ago and love it</li>
            <li>Easy to use</li>
            <li>It is easy to hold.</li>
            <li>I feel like it isn&#x27;t as easy as the commercials said it would be.</li>
            <li>you made my life easy.</li>
            <li>not as easy as the commercials suggest.</li>
            <li>2 stars for the easy return.</li>
            <li>Yeah, I forgot that I now have the tool to easily do it with</li>
            <li>Yeah, I forgot that I now have the tool to easily do it with</li>
            <li>I found that easy to change.  </li>
            <li>Can easily burn scalp/fingers.</li>
            <li>Works very good lots better than the other roller one .</li>
            <li>the handle isnt huge so its easy to hold.</li>
            <li>Word of caution, if you have fine hair like I do , start from lower heat setting , also use the guard that is provided.</li>
            <li>I was in a rush and my hair was still slightly damp once, and I still got great results!</li>
            <li>Easy to use and makes my hair smooth and curly without looking like sherley temple.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine</li>
            <li>Received order quickly!</li>
            <li>I am not obligated to provide a positive or favorable review, just my honest opinion.  </li>
            <li>I am not obligated to provide a positive or favorable review, just my honest opinion.  </li>
            <li>Between the rotating sound is quite irritating(noisy)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love and the time I save from using an original flat iron is amazing!</li>
            <li>your hair conditioned, use a heat protect spray/leave in light conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>She also liked the different options for hair type that were available that was a nice feature also.</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t smooth out my hair as it advertised.</li>
            <li>The InStyler, however, leaves my hair so smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>and it is such a great deal.</li>
            <li>and I can’t wait for colder weather to arrive and have hair that looks fabulous and shines!&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I can’t wait for colder weather to arrive and have hair that looks fabulous and shines!&lt;br</li>
            <li>after two month, I sound noise from it.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Personally I don&#x27;t find it a good value, though I suspect it works better for some hair than others.  </li>
            <li>I bought one today and it absolutely works!!!</li>
            <li>This is quick and easy.</li>
            <li>The two way roller makes things super easy.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m even excited I got the purple one</li>
            <li>I took the iron out of the package and once I became familiar with the literature included, I was able to start within 5 minutes and the Instyler was ready to go before I was in under a minute!</li>
            <li>I sure didn’t at first</li>
            <li>I sure didn’t at first</li>
            <li>I guess maybe it returns to max heat between uses a bit quicker than the original, but it does not seem to make a difference.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, stick with the original.</li>
            <li>This NEVER happened to me with the Original.</li>
            <li>The bristles on this are flimsier too than on the Original...</li>
            <li>I prefer the original.</li>
            <li>So yeah it&#x27;s a bit hotter than the original</li>
            <li>Already tossed the packaging or I would return it to get the original.</li>
            <li>I was able to do my whole head in 12 minutes, and my hair is waist-length!</li>
            <li>I was so excited about getting this.  </li>
            <li>I am familiar with all types of hair tools.</li>
            <li>This one is not user friendly</li>
            <li>I have very fine straight hair.  </li>
            <li>I find I only need to use the lowest setting for the heat level and be cautious not to squeeze the hell out of the device because you don&#x27;t want to bend or damage the bristles on the instyler, these are vital to getting perfect results each time!</li>
            <li>but nothing special.</li>
            <li>This baby has to work and treat my hair nice, plus keep whatever style I choose looking fresh and vibrant.</li>
            <li>the rotating barrel really does help to make my hair look absolutely fabulous!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m Going to get one more, I like it that much, and the color also...</li>
            <li>People think it is some kind of professional tool</li>
            <li>I love how fast it heats up</li>
            <li>Guess it goes to show that it pays at time to believe what everyone says as it just may be true.</li>
            <li>It is nice that you can keep the heat low for fine hair</li>
            <li>An excellent gift for my brother&#x27;s household which consists of a wife and multiple teenage daughters.</li>
            <li>It does straighten well, and quickly.  </li>
            <li>Overall I am very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>and you want it sleek, smooth and STRAIGHT, this product is for you!  </li>
            <li>but it gets very hot</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it about a dozen times it gets very HOT.</li>
            <li>To my surprise, I wouldn&#x27;t think that this would cost the price that it is; however my nieces seem to love this new gift of theirs.</li>
            <li>Had the original and it was too hot, burned my hair.</li>
            <li>I was vey excited when I first started using it, until it shut off by itself.</li>
            <li>I just tried the 2-way Instyler (Purple, 1.25&amp;#34;) after using the Original for years.</li>
            <li>My photos tell the entire lovely story!</li>
            <li>As a straightener, it went right through his hair and quickly straightened it.  </li>
            <li>I have fairly fine, straight, lifeless hair</li>
            <li>For doing hair straight it is excellent for doing curls it is hard but still working on it</li>
            <li>After several years of loyal service I thought, &amp;#34;Hey, you&#x27;ve gotten more than your money&#x27;s worth!</li>
            <li>Three days later and this thing is still amazing.</li>
            <li>Fun to try, but I recommend having someone do it for you to see what can be done with it than trying to wing it yourself.</li>
            <li>She really enjoys using this and has complimented me on a great purchase and because of the money that I spent, I&#x27;ve complimented myself as well.</li>
            <li>and I knew I had a problem with hair tools when I had to Swiffer the dust periodically off the tools I rarely use.</li>
            <li>and I knew I had a problem with hair tools when I had to Swiffer the dust periodically off the tools I rarely use.</li>
            <li>Not crazy about this product at all.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t work worth anything.</li>
            <li>Love this item came as promised better then expected</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Will give her the money next time so she can choose her own</li>
            <li>I quickly began and my first lock of hair went in and the barrel began to softly rotate as it pulled more hair length in.</li>
            <li>like the first one I love it and the new two rotation direction makes styling easier and faster.  </li>
            <li>The 2 turn technology in this is very useful and works really well.</li>
            <li>Although this one has more heat settings than the original even low sometimes fries my hair.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for that fast alternative you can get on the first try it might be better to stick to your regular straightener as I&#x27;m sure this thing takes a while to master for some people.</li>
            <li>I now know I can go longer in between hair cuts when using the right hair heat styling protective products.  </li>
            <li>Not to mention it was a pain in the rear to get it to spin the right direction.</li>
            <li>Just not the right tool for me.</li>
            <li>But I wanted a straightener for those once in a while occasions where I want to have beautiful straight round brush hair.</li>
            <li>The tool gets pretty darn hot!</li>
            <li>so I can not get very flat my hair from the root, other them that It&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not useful or good</li>
            <li>So far the return on this has been easy</li>
            <li>It takes a little bit of practice to get good with it</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>Love that I can switch direction with a double click!</li>
            <li>It gets hot quickly,30 seconds.</li>
            <li>That was my excitement over finally being able to use this product  </li>
            <li>if anything - with my hair I&#x27;d have been willing to keep going at it.</li>
            <li>and this really gives you a lift and a style!</li>
            <li>it...takes longer to do hair...not getting as hot....</li>
            <li>I was hesitant at first because it was premiered on an infomercial.</li>
            <li>The price is worth it as I found this was a quality piece and is very well made.</li>
            <li>I have been watching and drooling over the Instyler hot iron commercials for a while now.</li>
            <li>Always wondering how it worked, does it work, to will my hair end up needing to be cut out at attempting the first curl.</li>
            <li>I figure I first try it out and then share my results with my BFF of the month.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It’s a hot iron and a curling iron, all in one tool.  </li>
            <li>Verdict:&lt;br /&gt;I have always stated that all-in-one products most of the times do none at all well enough.</li>
            <li>Verdict:&lt;br /&gt;I have always stated that all-in-one products most of the times do none at all well enough.</li>
            <li>First of all, I can tell no difference in temperatures.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>I love it for big curl!  </li>
            <li>I will recommend more for big curls.</li>
            <li>Gets really hot but has not burned my hair.</li>
            <li>When I first heard of the InStyler</li>
            <li>Straightens your hair so fast it&#x27;s nuts!  </li>
            <li>This thing makes my hair shiny, bouncy, silky and it looks healthy and it is the only styling tool that I will ever use.</li>
            <li>This is my second InStyler (first Max), and I just love them.  </li>
            <li>How wonderful to finally have a styling tool that cuts down half the time  in doing or styling your hair; but very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Which if not careful can be prone to damage quite easily.</li>
            <li>Better than a flat iron.</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t work any better than the flat iron we had.</li>
            <li>Better off with just a flat iron.</li>
            <li>If you have wavy or curly hair and want to straighten it a little (but not all the way straight like a straightening iron would do), I think this is probably a good product.  </li>
            <li>I thought with the different barrel it would be more gentle.  </li>
            <li>I still have to sometimes use my flat iron on top of certain spots afterwards, still getting used to it.</li>
            <li>When I flat iron my hair, it takes about thirty minutes,  because I have to section-section-section and go over each section with the flat iron followed by a brush...THIRTY MINUTES, and I am quick, adept and fast!</li>
            <li>I have long, naturally curly Mexican hair that has only been straightened successfully once by a flat iron and someone&#x27;s experienced hands.</li>
            <li>I have very curly, wavy thick hair and was so happy to finally find a product that semi-straightens my hair quickly!</li>
            <li>Overall, I wanted to love it, and give it a chance, but it&#x27;s back to the Original for me.</li>
            <li>If you already have pretty straight hair, I think this is too much effort for what you get out of it.  </li>
            <li>The device costs too much for what it does (which is pretty much nothing).  </li>
            <li>Not anymore, this Instyler is even easier because you can switch the direction of the rotating wheel to avoid paining your wrist to hold it a certain way.</li>
            <li>So great for my thick, wavy hair!</li>
            <li>I am in love with this thing, and highly recommend it for girls that have curly hair and have to flat iron their hair</li>
            <li>but honestly it doesn&#x27;t do any better than a blow dry with a round brush.</li>
            <li>A girl wonders these things :) and even with such in mind, you bet I still wanted to try it because beauty equals bravery in my book when it comes to new products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Un Rato Juntas and Instyler, was kind enough to not only send me one to try but also one to share.</li>
            <li>It has a little booklet with it that gives you the basics on how to use it and what products you should use with it to get the best results, but it also tells you to watch the online video to see how it actually works on different lengths and thickness of hair.</li>
            <li>But once I received my own, I found that it was too much work for everyday use.  </li>
            <li>and I used on my hair one time and my hair came out really straight and with Shine</li>
            <li>I now use it in place of my straight iron and curling iron.  </li>
            <li>She really likes it an uses it quite a bit throughout the week.</li>
            <li>Being the teenagers they are, they absolutely adore this iron--which they can use for their desires curly hair.</li>
            <li>Then, the rotating heated polishing cylinder gently glides over your hair, polishing, straightening, and styling each strand.</li>
            <li>It knew what problems customers would get into and it prepared very well.</li>
            <li>(sometimes I think my stick straight hair looks too 80&#x27;s</li>
            <li>It stayed straight, no puffing and no frizz.</li>
            <li>Bought it foe the wife she absolutely loves it using it about three times a week to straighten her hair</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally straight but the ends and bed head...eh!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>once you get it, fast and awesome!&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>I expected more.....</li>
            <li>I got her thanks to the ease of use with this curler.</li>
            <li>Get the most out of the Instyler by watching tutorials and reading the directions carefully and taking safety precautions.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s fast.</li>
            <li>It works really well</li>
            <li>It turns my curly frizzy hair intro straight and shiny hair.</li>
            <li>much~</li>
            <li>This is a really neat product.</li>
            <li>waiting time because within 30 seconds, the rapid heat-up system is ready to go.&lt;br</li>
            <li>No one wants a crispy look!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Each hair strand really gets the royalty treatment</li>
            <li>but now my reason is really talking to myself about what style I want</li>
            <li>received the above product(s) free of charge from Un Rato Juntas and Instyler.  </li>
            <li>but now my reason is really talking to myself about what style I want</li>
            <li>received the above product(s) free of charge from Un Rato Juntas and Instyler.  </li>
            <li>Really like the this tool.</li>
            <li>My diamond plated straightener off groupon works MUCH nicer than this did.</li>
            <li>My hair has gentle waves.</li>
            <li>Hearing her rave about it made me more curious on how it performs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got a Remington S7231 Wet to Straight Straightener that I like better too.  </li>
            <li>I much prefer this to a regular curling iron as it gives a more natural look - not so rigid.  </li>
            <li>It definitely got hot quickly.</li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t leave them silky, stylish or pretty - just a mess of raggy witch hair.</li>
            <li>Its highest heat setting definitely does not get as hot as the Original - strange, because it&#x27;s supposed to go up to 425 F vs 410 F on the Original.</li>
            <li>This was easy to use and I like that I can use it on dry hair.</li>
            <li>it was supposed to make my life easier, but I think the reason it took me so long to do my hair was because the barrel changed directions on me so many times, and this, without my consciously double-tapping it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather have 2 really good tools than one that only does half of what it says it does on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get nearly as hot as the old.</li>
            <li>Never did I think that a product that received a lot of hype actually proved to be true.</li>
            <li>But with continued use, I noticed my hair was looking flat and super shiny, like it had too much product in it.  </li>
            <li>but i have try many times to make curls but it doesnt success, and the temperature seems like is not hot enough.</li>
            <li>She says this one is way better than her previous iron because it can rotate both way and had it where she likes it.</li>
            <li>Also, if I had to do over, I would buy the older version that does NOT change direction.  </li>
            <li>Super dependable when I need a fixer upper.  </li>
            <li>I may only be able to use it occasionally if it&#x27;s going to melt my hair.</li>
            <li>I understand this is an improvement on the older model that did not change directions.</li>
            <li>I have super curly hair, and these are the only tools I can use to get it</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t clip it down on your hair to secure hair in first without rotation motion turning on.</li>
            <li>I have long wavy and very frizzy hair and have tried many different types of hair styling tools and products.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste time or money on original flat irons buy this instyler for a beautiful round brush outcome.</li>
            <li>In high humidity, I have to put it up.</li>
            <li>I was heat styling my hair since high school.</li>
            <li>Also highly recommended to use the hair conditioner before using the Instyler to curl your hair.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended it.</li>
            <li>could have been clearly noted in the description box section or like my Nume curlers supplied me with an adapter!!</li>
            <li>I was also able to curl my hair a little at the ends.</li>
            <li>And it is easy to use in a minimal amount of time!  </li>
            <li>So far I really like it and can&#x27;t wait to become a pro using that tool.</li>
            <li>my ends are silky smooth and not burnt, damaged or crushed like beetle legs.</li>
            <li>I took a leap of faith and needless to say I am happy I did.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t return it and will use it occasionally, but it really  isn&#x27;t worth the effort.  </li>
            <li>Because of the increased amount of passes and the slower process I felt I was damaging my African American hair far more than I had in the past.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I feel it&#x27;s soooo much better than using a curling iron everyday.</li>
            <li>When using my normal flatiron, at least the ends look nice.</li>
            <li>The instyler is good, but not great.</li>
            <li>In my opinion the InStyler max uses less heat than traditional hot tools, and delivers better results.</li>
            <li>The highest temperature setting does not match the max on the old, so it doesn&#x27;t actually straighten my hair as quickly.</li>
            <li>This beauty tool not only straightens but quickly created a soft curl without losing one strand of hair.</li>
            <li>if purchasing this product please be aware of the plug I have had to purchase an adapter as I live in the UK , this plug in was different compared to other products that I have purchased from the USA this one has two thin pins, so I have not been able to use this product until my delivery for a USA to UK converter adapter comes!!!</li>
            <li>and it was new with the box and plastic and everything</li>
            <li>Purchased this for my wife because she needed a new hairstyler.</li>
            <li>Instyler iron has an auto-shut off safety feature, in case you get a text or walk out the door too soon because you are eager to show off your new style.</li>
            <li>I accidentally dropped the new model on the floor, and one of the brushes broke off.</li>
            <li>and i needed a new one.</li>
            <li>This is my third InStyler but the first with Max 2-Way Rotation.</li>
            <li>I was using hot curlers prior to buying this</li>
            <li>It works well for both smooths out the waves and controls the frizzieness of natural curly!</li>
            <li>I felt nothing pull out of my scalp and in less than 5 seconds (I have fine hair but lots of it), I was done.</li>
            <li>Previously, I had owned many hair straighteners and finally settled on a Chi.</li>
            <li>figured I&#x27;d upgrade in order to get the new version which supposedly would get 10 degrees hotter (425 vs 415) which would come in handy for my thick, coarse hair.</li>
            <li>In the past I have only used flat irons but this works really well for making nice waves in hair.</li>
            <li>This actually works for my long curly hair and is a nice change from my regular flat iron.  </li>
            <li>My old one had a brush crack and had to throw the brush part out</li>
            <li>But it is not harsh on her hair like a curling iron or straightener.</li>
            <li>Bought this for a wife because she keeps complaining about her old iron.</li>
            <li>I have my hair natural</li>
            <li>My daughter has very curly hair and we brushed through it then tried this</li>
            <li>Despite giving it many tries I failed what I wanted, and realized my hair looked better curled and uncombed than straightened with this thing.</li>
            <li>Just didn&#x27;t work for me, so don&#x27;t be surprised if it&#x27;s not your thing.</li>
            <li>It can give a bunch of different looks, not just a straight hair look.</li>
            <li>With this product, It looks as-if it has been professionally curled.</li>
            <li>After reading reviews and watching a couple videos on YouTube I was convinced this would work on my naturally curly, frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li>so far I have no complains.</li>
            <li>but my hair has those naturally.  </li>
            <li>Then I saw the price and thought that maybe I could just go about things the old fashion way.</li>
            <li>I admit it&#x27;s a bit of a learning curve, but my hair also did get caught on the edge of the barrel several times, and I lost more than a few strips of hair to entanglement</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always used ceramic flat irons, and more so lately,the flat irons just dry and split my ends.</li>
            <li>I was a little hesitant because of the cost, but it was worth every penny!</li>
            <li>My hair wasn&#x27;t as straight as when I&#x27;d used the Chi flat iron, nor was it as shine.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money spent here!</li>
            <li>Got this for my girlfriend as her birthday was coming up and decided this would be decent present to go with something else I got her.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving it two stars because my bff actually bought the traditional one from Target, and I found that it is pretty comparable to the one I purchased years ago.</li>
            <li>Love this..kinda difficult to use at first</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s the same effect as when you iron clothes on too high a setting, it melts the fabric and makes it look shiny.  </li>
            <li>The secret lies in its rotating heated polishing cylinder, tourmaline ceramic floating plate and four rows of precision-aligned bristles When you run the InStyler max rotating hot iron through your hair, the first set of bristles gently sort and separate your hair strands.</li>
            <li>I stopped using it for a couple of weeks and my hair seems to be getting back to normal.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE how it brushes as it goes, it keeps the frizz down and help me manage tangles as I go, instead of having to stop here and there to brush down my uncurled hair.</li>
            <li>Risky, since it&#x27;s expensive!&lt;br /&gt;I have never been able to blow dry my hair with a round brush and get that flip affect!</li>
            <li>She absolutely hates it (especially after having wanted it for so long).  </li>
            <li>I had to go back to my old one and return this one.</li>
            <li>I was recommended this by 2 women (both mixed race) who had naturally curly hair that they relaxed.</li>
            <li>The bristles aren&#x27;t had sturdy or numerous as my old Instyler, so the results aren&#x27;t as smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I wish I had my old go to back.</li>
            <li>I have short naturally curly hair, but of course it never curls the way I would like it to, until now.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve loved all three InStylers, but am not too crazy about the 2-way rotation.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also more difficult to get pin straight hair because it curves the hair in especially with short hair.</li>
            <li>You can choose from Fine, Medium, to Thick or Coarse hair.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get hot enough so it doesn&#x27;t really do anything for frizzy thick hair.</li>
            <li>I feel like my curls are just too much for this and gave up after only 2 tries.  </li>
            <li>After I bought it, I ended up cutting my hair shorter so it would not do as good as my regular straightener.</li>
            <li>Although this one has 4 heat settings still a little bit too hot.</li>
            <li>So far blowdrying my hair is the only cure I found for flat hair.</li>
            <li>Surprised it took me this long to get one.</li>
            <li>You can obtain soft curls that are loose and bouncy, to tight curls and even straight hair styles.</li>
            <li>It does not dry hair like flat iron.</li>

            <li> lol</li>
            <li> She already had a straightening iron from Chi which does great on the straightening.  </li>
            <li> My wife loves it and her hair looks great when she uses it.</li>
            <li> but I think it is great.  </li>
            <li> I love the InStyler!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect and it&#x27;s really easy to use it!    </li>
            <li> Top quality and perfect even for those who aren&#x27;t to great with  hair styling.</li>
            <li> I watched it over and over until I felt confident that I was using it correctly to get the best results.</li>
            <li> This thing is the most incredible hair tool I have ever used!</li>
            <li> Really good value for the money and a great suggestion for any gift for a woman who&#x27;s here comes before anything or anybody else.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and looks impressive in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> Easy to use excellent product!</li>
            <li> how good job I did.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say I am as good as a hairstylist Lon doing my hair</li>
            <li> Shiny and gorgeous hair locks can do that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> Instyler Max Rotating Iron is a gorgeous piece of hardware</li>
            <li> I think this product is good for people who want that curved in look.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m also not at all impressed by the cheap construction of the iron.</li>
            <li> To buy a. Abdapter  good idea to put shield on it as I burnt my forehead</li>
            <li> Using a straightener takes me a good hour</li>
            <li> The original was wonderful.</li>
            <li> The Max is beautiful, love the purple, but it does nothing for my hair.</li>
            <li> Love it, very important to watch the videos and U tube posts for tips to get the best results.</li>
            <li> However, I am very impressed and satisfied with this product for many reasons:  </li>
            <li> This is the best iron that I have used and it is definitely worth the price I paid for it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very smooth!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very sure that the problem wasn&#x27;t from my power bar.</li>
            <li> I was set and done and most importantly……super happy with the results.</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> This one is so much better!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I love it!  </li>
            <li> Okay, I get it!</li>
            <li> I needed something to straighten my hair and it works better than anything I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
            <li> I Love it!</li>
            <li> Outstanding product!</li>
            <li> I love this product !</li>
            <li> but I love it!</li>

            <li> Love!  </li>

            <li> Love!  </li>
            <li> I love this thing!</li>
            <li> great and easy to use thank you InStyer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and I have always had great results.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and does a great job.</li>
            <li> and it did not leave a nice finished product.</li>
            <li> While that seems like it would be a nice feature, there were times when it would change direction</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has body and the nice under flip I want!&lt;br</li>
            <li> wish they made 2 kind of voltage 110&amp;220</li>
            <li> I’m a cut-it-off before it singes my scalp kind of gal.</li>
            <li> I’m a cut-it-off before it singes my scalp kind of gal.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t rotate two ways as promised and it doesn&#x27;t by any means get ethnic hair as nicely coiffed as it claims.</li>
            <li> It gives me nice shape around my face</li>
            <li> and she just so happen to own a InStyler.</li>
            <li> Nice product and</li>
            <li> From the videos touting how easily and quickly you can have flawless shiny hairstyles</li>
            <li> Let it be known that I have the original Instyler and love it!!</li>
            <li> Very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> THe product seems to be genuine and was made from really good material.</li>
            <li> Not the greatest hair appliance I&#x27;ve ever used, by far.</li>
            <li> The smooth styles you create will remain gorgeous without damaging your hair.</li>
            <li> :) makes my hair look nice</li>
            <li> By far the best curling iron on the market</li>
            <li> Wow, WORKS GREAT!</li>
            <li> Good and fast shipping!!!</li>
            <li> And it is really EASY to use!</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair between my chin and shoulder.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so easy!  </li>
            <li> I  like it but not as good as the original</li>
            <li> I loved the original.</li>
            <li> I had the original InStyler and LOVED it.  </li>
            <li> I used it at a friends house when I didn&#x27;t have my curling iron and thought it was good at curling my ends under without giving me full curls</li>
            <li> Love how easy it is to use!</li>
            <li> The way it is made is very cheap like, but besides that it just didn&#x27;t work for us.</li>
            <li> It made my hair very smooth and shiny.  </li>
            <li> I am so glad that I invested the money in it.  </li>
            <li> so probably my rating would be 5 stars if I were more efficient in using it.</li>
            <li> but I sure have gotten tons of compliments on styling job I did.</li>
            <li> This Get Instyler is my favorite and a life saver.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li> Love LOVE LOVE THIS.</li>
            <li> Just get it don&#x27;t question it and try for yourself you will love it.</li>
            <li> With this one I felt like I needed to test it before each section to make sure I knew which way it was rotating.</li>
            <li> and I love how smooth and shiny my hair is after using it!</li>
            <li> Love the lift and straightening I get with it.</li>
            <li> It was better than nothing.</li>
            <li> If it can help my dreary head of hair, it should be able to help just about anyone.  </li>
            <li> She end up almost liking this more</li>
            <li> I get better results.</li>
            <li> With the Instyler I can have the same hair perfect hairstyle every time!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say I love it</li>
            <li> I LOVE mine</li>
            <li> Love this soooo</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t describe how much I love this.</li>
            <li> Makes curling way better experience.</li>
            <li> Okay, it knows me and knows I don’t like to wait.</li>
            <li> why I don’t style my hair like this more often.</li>
            <li> ’s day comes, telling myself I better use them because I have to justify the purchase……</li>
            <li> ’s day comes, telling myself I better use them because I have to justify the purchase……</li>
            <li> It can give some volume but mostly just gives you a bump in your hair.</li>
            <li> OK just wish</li>
            <li> ut had more heat settings than one at this price.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I thought the product would work much better than it</li>
            <li> Except for the barrel it&#x27;s mostly plastic.</li>
            <li> I love that this rolls both way.  </li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for a friends after many years of wanting an InStyler.</li>
            <li> maybe it works better when I have longer hair.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair so healthy looking</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying that Vocalpoint provided me with free products in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li> I think it is an appliance that will work for some, but for me, I&#x27;ve got better things.  </li>
            <li> I was able to get a bit of flip on the ends of his hair.  </li>
            <li> suggest if you can, try it before buying, or make sure you can return it, in case you are like me, and your hair just sits and spins on it without doing anything.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you buy the Instyler, be sure to start with a layer of hair that you won&#x27;t mind having to cut off.</li>
            <li> The longer I use it the better I get with it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> For my hair I think a heated brush (like a Calista Tools  brand) would be better.</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved it at first.  </li>
            <li> I think it is no doubt best for girls with long hair.</li>
            <li> I loved it so much!</li>
            <li> I love this product, it feels great on my hair leaving it soft and shinny.</li>
            <li> But other than that this is a wonderful product :3</li>
            <li> It just gives a final look that makes it look like you tried to straighten your hair, but didn&#x27;t do a very good job at it....</li>
            <li> Since then I&#x27;d dreamed of being able to do that myself, and figured this product would show me the light.</li>
            <li> I am so happy that I bought this and threw my old hair iron out.</li>
            <li> The curling attachment it comes with works great as well making my hair have volume and natural looking curls.</li>
            <li> To straight is good too</li>
            <li> love this iron, easy to use, hair become smooth and silky</li>
            <li> Bought the max because it rotates both ways, I bought the original two years ago and love it</li>
            <li> Easy to use</li>
            <li> It is easy to hold.</li>
            <li> I feel like it isn&#x27;t as easy as the commercials said it would be.</li>
            <li> you made my life easy.</li>
            <li> not as easy as the commercials suggest.</li>
            <li> 2 stars for the easy return.</li>
            <li> Yeah, I forgot that I now have the tool to easily do it with</li>
            <li> Yeah, I forgot that I now have the tool to easily do it with</li>
            <li> I found that easy to change.  </li>
            <li> Can easily burn scalp/fingers.</li>
            <li> Works very good lots better than the other roller one .</li>
            <li> the handle isnt huge so its easy to hold.</li>
            <li> Word of caution, if you have fine hair like I do , start from lower heat setting , also use the guard that is provided.</li>
            <li> I was in a rush and my hair was still slightly damp once, and I still got great results!</li>
            <li> Easy to use and makes my hair smooth and curly without looking like sherley temple.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine</li>
            <li> Received order quickly!</li>
            <li> I am not obligated to provide a positive or favorable review, just my honest opinion.  </li>
            <li> I am not obligated to provide a positive or favorable review, just my honest opinion.  </li>
            <li> Between the rotating sound is quite irritating(noisy)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love and the time I save from using an original flat iron is amazing!</li>
            <li> your hair conditioned, use a heat protect spray/leave in light conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> She also liked the different options for hair type that were available that was a nice feature also.</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t smooth out my hair as it advertised.</li>
            <li> The InStyler, however, leaves my hair so smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> and it is such a great deal.</li>
            <li> and I can’t wait for colder weather to arrive and have hair that looks fabulous and shines!&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I can’t wait for colder weather to arrive and have hair that looks fabulous and shines!&lt;br</li>
            <li> after two month, I sound noise from it.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> Personally I don&#x27;t find it a good value, though I suspect it works better for some hair than others.  </li>
            <li> I bought one today and it absolutely works!!!</li>
            <li> This is quick and easy.</li>
            <li> The two way roller makes things super easy.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m even excited I got the purple one</li>
            <li> I took the iron out of the package and once I became familiar with the literature included, I was able to start within 5 minutes and the Instyler was ready to go before I was in under a minute!</li>
            <li> I sure didn’t at first</li>
            <li> I sure didn’t at first</li>
            <li> I guess maybe it returns to max heat between uses a bit quicker than the original, but it does not seem to make a difference.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, stick with the original.</li>
            <li> This NEVER happened to me with the Original.</li>
            <li> The bristles on this are flimsier too than on the Original...</li>
            <li> I prefer the original.</li>
            <li> So yeah it&#x27;s a bit hotter than the original</li>
            <li> Already tossed the packaging or I would return it to get the original.</li>
            <li> I was able to do my whole head in 12 minutes, and my hair is waist-length!</li>
            <li> I was so excited about getting this.  </li>
            <li> I am familiar with all types of hair tools.</li>
            <li> This one is not user friendly</li>
            <li> I have very fine straight hair.  </li>
            <li> I find I only need to use the lowest setting for the heat level and be cautious not to squeeze the hell out of the device because you don&#x27;t want to bend or damage the bristles on the instyler, these are vital to getting perfect results each time!</li>
            <li> but nothing special.</li>
            <li> This baby has to work and treat my hair nice, plus keep whatever style I choose looking fresh and vibrant.</li>
            <li> the rotating barrel really does help to make my hair look absolutely fabulous!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Going to get one more, I like it that much, and the color also...</li>
            <li> People think it is some kind of professional tool</li>
            <li> I love how fast it heats up</li>
            <li> Guess it goes to show that it pays at time to believe what everyone says as it just may be true.</li>
            <li> It is nice that you can keep the heat low for fine hair</li>
            <li> An excellent gift for my brother&#x27;s household which consists of a wife and multiple teenage daughters.</li>
            <li> It does straighten well, and quickly.  </li>
            <li> Overall I am very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> and you want it sleek, smooth and STRAIGHT, this product is for you!  </li>
            <li> but it gets very hot</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it about a dozen times it gets very HOT.</li>
            <li> To my surprise, I wouldn&#x27;t think that this would cost the price that it is; however my nieces seem to love this new gift of theirs.</li>
            <li> Had the original and it was too hot, burned my hair.</li>
            <li> I was vey excited when I first started using it, until it shut off by itself.</li>
            <li> I just tried the 2-way Instyler (Purple, 1.25&amp;#34;) after using the Original for years.</li>
            <li> My photos tell the entire lovely story!</li>
            <li> As a straightener, it went right through his hair and quickly straightened it.  </li>
            <li> I have fairly fine, straight, lifeless hair</li>
            <li> For doing hair straight it is excellent for doing curls it is hard but still working on it</li>
            <li> After several years of loyal service I thought, &amp;#34;Hey, you&#x27;ve gotten more than your money&#x27;s worth!</li>
            <li> Three days later and this thing is still amazing.</li>
            <li> Fun to try, but I recommend having someone do it for you to see what can be done with it than trying to wing it yourself.</li>
            <li> She really enjoys using this and has complimented me on a great purchase and because of the money that I spent, I&#x27;ve complimented myself as well.</li>
            <li> and I knew I had a problem with hair tools when I had to Swiffer the dust periodically off the tools I rarely use.</li>
            <li> and I knew I had a problem with hair tools when I had to Swiffer the dust periodically off the tools I rarely use.</li>
            <li> Not crazy about this product at all.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work worth anything.</li>
            <li> Love this item came as promised better then expected</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Will give her the money next time so she can choose her own</li>
            <li> I quickly began and my first lock of hair went in and the barrel began to softly rotate as it pulled more hair length in.</li>
            <li> like the first one I love it and the new two rotation direction makes styling easier and faster.  </li>
            <li> The 2 turn technology in this is very useful and works really well.</li>
            <li> Although this one has more heat settings than the original even low sometimes fries my hair.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for that fast alternative you can get on the first try it might be better to stick to your regular straightener as I&#x27;m sure this thing takes a while to master for some people.</li>
            <li> I now know I can go longer in between hair cuts when using the right hair heat styling protective products.  </li>
            <li> Not to mention it was a pain in the rear to get it to spin the right direction.</li>
            <li> Just not the right tool for me.</li>
            <li> But I wanted a straightener for those once in a while occasions where I want to have beautiful straight round brush hair.</li>
            <li> The tool gets pretty darn hot!</li>
            <li> so I can not get very flat my hair from the root, other them that It&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not useful or good</li>
            <li> So far the return on this has been easy</li>
            <li> It takes a little bit of practice to get good with it</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> Love that I can switch direction with a double click!</li>
            <li> It gets hot quickly,30 seconds.</li>
            <li> That was my excitement over finally being able to use this product  </li>
            <li> if anything - with my hair I&#x27;d have been willing to keep going at it.</li>
            <li> and this really gives you a lift and a style!</li>
            <li> it...takes longer to do hair...not getting as hot....</li>
            <li> I was hesitant at first because it was premiered on an infomercial.</li>
            <li> The price is worth it as I found this was a quality piece and is very well made.</li>
            <li> I have been watching and drooling over the Instyler hot iron commercials for a while now.</li>
            <li> Always wondering how it worked, does it work, to will my hair end up needing to be cut out at attempting the first curl.</li>
            <li> I figure I first try it out and then share my results with my BFF of the month.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It’s a hot iron and a curling iron, all in one tool.  </li>
            <li> Verdict:&lt;br /&gt;I have always stated that all-in-one products most of the times do none at all well enough.</li>
            <li> Verdict:&lt;br /&gt;I have always stated that all-in-one products most of the times do none at all well enough.</li>
            <li> First of all, I can tell no difference in temperatures.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> I love it for big curl!  </li>
            <li> I will recommend more for big curls.</li>
            <li> Gets really hot but has not burned my hair.</li>
            <li> When I first heard of the InStyler</li>
            <li> Straightens your hair so fast it&#x27;s nuts!  </li>
            <li> This thing makes my hair shiny, bouncy, silky and it looks healthy and it is the only styling tool that I will ever use.</li>
            <li> This is my second InStyler (first Max), and I just love them.  </li>
            <li> How wonderful to finally have a styling tool that cuts down half the time  in doing or styling your hair; but very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Which if not careful can be prone to damage quite easily.</li>
            <li> Better than a flat iron.</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t work any better than the flat iron we had.</li>
            <li> Better off with just a flat iron.</li>
            <li> If you have wavy or curly hair and want to straighten it a little (but not all the way straight like a straightening iron would do), I think this is probably a good product.  </li>
            <li> I thought with the different barrel it would be more gentle.  </li>
            <li> I still have to sometimes use my flat iron on top of certain spots afterwards, still getting used to it.</li>
            <li> When I flat iron my hair, it takes about thirty minutes,  because I have to section-section-section and go over each section with the flat iron followed by a brush...THIRTY MINUTES, and I am quick, adept and fast!</li>
            <li> I have long, naturally curly Mexican hair that has only been straightened successfully once by a flat iron and someone&#x27;s experienced hands.</li>
            <li> I have very curly, wavy thick hair and was so happy to finally find a product that semi-straightens my hair quickly!</li>
            <li> Overall, I wanted to love it, and give it a chance, but it&#x27;s back to the Original for me.</li>
            <li> If you already have pretty straight hair, I think this is too much effort for what you get out of it.  </li>
            <li> The device costs too much for what it does (which is pretty much nothing).  </li>
            <li> Not anymore, this Instyler is even easier because you can switch the direction of the rotating wheel to avoid paining your wrist to hold it a certain way.</li>
            <li> So great for my thick, wavy hair!</li>
            <li> I am in love with this thing, and highly recommend it for girls that have curly hair and have to flat iron their hair</li>
            <li> but honestly it doesn&#x27;t do any better than a blow dry with a round brush.</li>
            <li> A girl wonders these things :) and even with such in mind, you bet I still wanted to try it because beauty equals bravery in my book when it comes to new products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Un Rato Juntas and Instyler, was kind enough to not only send me one to try but also one to share.</li>
            <li> It has a little booklet with it that gives you the basics on how to use it and what products you should use with it to get the best results, but it also tells you to watch the online video to see how it actually works on different lengths and thickness of hair.</li>
            <li> But once I received my own, I found that it was too much work for everyday use.  </li>
            <li> and I used on my hair one time and my hair came out really straight and with Shine</li>
            <li> I now use it in place of my straight iron and curling iron.  </li>
            <li> She really likes it an uses it quite a bit throughout the week.</li>
            <li> Being the teenagers they are, they absolutely adore this iron--which they can use for their desires curly hair.</li>
            <li> Then, the rotating heated polishing cylinder gently glides over your hair, polishing, straightening, and styling each strand.</li>
            <li> It knew what problems customers would get into and it prepared very well.</li>
            <li> (sometimes I think my stick straight hair looks too 80&#x27;s</li>
            <li> It stayed straight, no puffing and no frizz.</li>
            <li> Bought it foe the wife she absolutely loves it using it about three times a week to straighten her hair</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally straight but the ends and bed head...eh!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> once you get it, fast and awesome!&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> I expected more.....</li>
            <li> I got her thanks to the ease of use with this curler.</li>
            <li> Get the most out of the Instyler by watching tutorials and reading the directions carefully and taking safety precautions.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s fast.</li>
            <li> It works really well</li>
            <li> It turns my curly frizzy hair intro straight and shiny hair.</li>
            <li> much~</li>
            <li> This is a really neat product.</li>
            <li> waiting time because within 30 seconds, the rapid heat-up system is ready to go.&lt;br</li>
            <li> No one wants a crispy look!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Each hair strand really gets the royalty treatment</li>
            <li> but now my reason is really talking to myself about what style I want</li>
            <li> received the above product(s) free of charge from Un Rato Juntas and Instyler.  </li>
            <li> but now my reason is really talking to myself about what style I want</li>
            <li> received the above product(s) free of charge from Un Rato Juntas and Instyler.  </li>
            <li> Really like the this tool.</li>
            <li> My diamond plated straightener off groupon works MUCH nicer than this did.</li>
            <li> My hair has gentle waves.</li>
            <li> Hearing her rave about it made me more curious on how it performs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got a Remington S7231 Wet to Straight Straightener that I like better too.  </li>
            <li> I much prefer this to a regular curling iron as it gives a more natural look - not so rigid.  </li>
            <li> It definitely got hot quickly.</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t leave them silky, stylish or pretty - just a mess of raggy witch hair.</li>
            <li> Its highest heat setting definitely does not get as hot as the Original - strange, because it&#x27;s supposed to go up to 425 F vs 410 F on the Original.</li>
            <li> This was easy to use and I like that I can use it on dry hair.</li>
            <li> it was supposed to make my life easier, but I think the reason it took me so long to do my hair was because the barrel changed directions on me so many times, and this, without my consciously double-tapping it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather have 2 really good tools than one that only does half of what it says it does on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get nearly as hot as the old.</li>
            <li> Never did I think that a product that received a lot of hype actually proved to be true.</li>
            <li> But with continued use, I noticed my hair was looking flat and super shiny, like it had too much product in it.  </li>
            <li> but i have try many times to make curls but it doesnt success, and the temperature seems like is not hot enough.</li>
            <li> She says this one is way better than her previous iron because it can rotate both way and had it where she likes it.</li>
            <li> Also, if I had to do over, I would buy the older version that does NOT change direction.  </li>
            <li> Super dependable when I need a fixer upper.  </li>
            <li> I may only be able to use it occasionally if it&#x27;s going to melt my hair.</li>
            <li> I understand this is an improvement on the older model that did not change directions.</li>
            <li> I have super curly hair, and these are the only tools I can use to get it</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t clip it down on your hair to secure hair in first without rotation motion turning on.</li>
            <li> I have long wavy and very frizzy hair and have tried many different types of hair styling tools and products.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste time or money on original flat irons buy this instyler for a beautiful round brush outcome.</li>
            <li> In high humidity, I have to put it up.</li>
            <li> I was heat styling my hair since high school.</li>
            <li> Also highly recommended to use the hair conditioner before using the Instyler to curl your hair.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended it.</li>
            <li> could have been clearly noted in the description box section or like my Nume curlers supplied me with an adapter!!</li>
            <li> I was also able to curl my hair a little at the ends.</li>
            <li> And it is easy to use in a minimal amount of time!  </li>
            <li> So far I really like it and can&#x27;t wait to become a pro using that tool.</li>
            <li> my ends are silky smooth and not burnt, damaged or crushed like beetle legs.</li>
            <li> I took a leap of faith and needless to say I am happy I did.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t return it and will use it occasionally, but it really  isn&#x27;t worth the effort.  </li>
            <li> Because of the increased amount of passes and the slower process I felt I was damaging my African American hair far more than I had in the past.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I feel it&#x27;s soooo much better than using a curling iron everyday.</li>
            <li> When using my normal flatiron, at least the ends look nice.</li>
            <li> The instyler is good, but not great.</li>
            <li> In my opinion the InStyler max uses less heat than traditional hot tools, and delivers better results.</li>
            <li> The highest temperature setting does not match the max on the old, so it doesn&#x27;t actually straighten my hair as quickly.</li>
            <li> This beauty tool not only straightens but quickly created a soft curl without losing one strand of hair.</li>
            <li> if purchasing this product please be aware of the plug I have had to purchase an adapter as I live in the UK , this plug in was different compared to other products that I have purchased from the USA this one has two thin pins, so I have not been able to use this product until my delivery for a USA to UK converter adapter comes!!!</li>
            <li> and it was new with the box and plastic and everything</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my wife because she needed a new hairstyler.</li>
            <li> Instyler iron has an auto-shut off safety feature, in case you get a text or walk out the door too soon because you are eager to show off your new style.</li>
            <li> I accidentally dropped the new model on the floor, and one of the brushes broke off.</li>
            <li> and i needed a new one.</li>
            <li> This is my third InStyler but the first with Max 2-Way Rotation.</li>
            <li> I was using hot curlers prior to buying this</li>
            <li> It works well for both smooths out the waves and controls the frizzieness of natural curly!</li>
            <li> I felt nothing pull out of my scalp and in less than 5 seconds (I have fine hair but lots of it), I was done.</li>
            <li> Previously, I had owned many hair straighteners and finally settled on a Chi.</li>
            <li> figured I&#x27;d upgrade in order to get the new version which supposedly would get 10 degrees hotter (425 vs 415) which would come in handy for my thick, coarse hair.</li>
            <li> In the past I have only used flat irons but this works really well for making nice waves in hair.</li>
            <li> This actually works for my long curly hair and is a nice change from my regular flat iron.  </li>
            <li> My old one had a brush crack and had to throw the brush part out</li>
            <li> But it is not harsh on her hair like a curling iron or straightener.</li>
            <li> Bought this for a wife because she keeps complaining about her old iron.</li>
            <li> I have my hair natural</li>
            <li> My daughter has very curly hair and we brushed through it then tried this</li>
            <li> Despite giving it many tries I failed what I wanted, and realized my hair looked better curled and uncombed than straightened with this thing.</li>
            <li> Just didn&#x27;t work for me, so don&#x27;t be surprised if it&#x27;s not your thing.</li>
            <li> It can give a bunch of different looks, not just a straight hair look.</li>
            <li> With this product, It looks as-if it has been professionally curled.</li>
            <li> After reading reviews and watching a couple videos on YouTube I was convinced this would work on my naturally curly, frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li> so far I have no complains.</li>
            <li> but my hair has those naturally.  </li>
            <li> Then I saw the price and thought that maybe I could just go about things the old fashion way.</li>
            <li> I admit it&#x27;s a bit of a learning curve, but my hair also did get caught on the edge of the barrel several times, and I lost more than a few strips of hair to entanglement</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used ceramic flat irons, and more so lately,the flat irons just dry and split my ends.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant because of the cost, but it was worth every penny!</li>
            <li> My hair wasn&#x27;t as straight as when I&#x27;d used the Chi flat iron, nor was it as shine.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money spent here!</li>
            <li> Got this for my girlfriend as her birthday was coming up and decided this would be decent present to go with something else I got her.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it two stars because my bff actually bought the traditional one from Target, and I found that it is pretty comparable to the one I purchased years ago.</li>
            <li> Love this..kinda difficult to use at first</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s the same effect as when you iron clothes on too high a setting, it melts the fabric and makes it look shiny.  </li>
            <li> The secret lies in its rotating heated polishing cylinder, tourmaline ceramic floating plate and four rows of precision-aligned bristles When you run the InStyler max rotating hot iron through your hair, the first set of bristles gently sort and separate your hair strands.</li>
            <li> I stopped using it for a couple of weeks and my hair seems to be getting back to normal.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE how it brushes as it goes, it keeps the frizz down and help me manage tangles as I go, instead of having to stop here and there to brush down my uncurled hair.</li>
            <li> Risky, since it&#x27;s expensive!&lt;br /&gt;I have never been able to blow dry my hair with a round brush and get that flip affect!</li>
            <li> She absolutely hates it (especially after having wanted it for so long).  </li>
            <li> I had to go back to my old one and return this one.</li>
            <li> I was recommended this by 2 women (both mixed race) who had naturally curly hair that they relaxed.</li>
            <li> The bristles aren&#x27;t had sturdy or numerous as my old Instyler, so the results aren&#x27;t as smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I wish I had my old go to back.</li>
            <li> I have short naturally curly hair, but of course it never curls the way I would like it to, until now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve loved all three InStylers, but am not too crazy about the 2-way rotation.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also more difficult to get pin straight hair because it curves the hair in especially with short hair.</li>
            <li> You can choose from Fine, Medium, to Thick or Coarse hair.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get hot enough so it doesn&#x27;t really do anything for frizzy thick hair.</li>
            <li> I feel like my curls are just too much for this and gave up after only 2 tries.  </li>
            <li> After I bought it, I ended up cutting my hair shorter so it would not do as good as my regular straightener.</li>
            <li> Although this one has 4 heat settings still a little bit too hot.</li>
            <li> So far blowdrying my hair is the only cure I found for flat hair.</li>
            <li> Surprised it took me this long to get one.</li>
            <li> You can obtain soft curls that are loose and bouncy, to tight curls and even straight hair styles.</li>
            <li> It does not dry hair like flat iron.</li>
            <li> It took me 2+ hours to do my hair (longish) as opposed to 45-60 mins with the Original - I do have thick, wavy/unmanageable hair, but that&#x27;s not an excuse for why it took so long.</li>
            <li> I have used several different brands of flat irons over the years without mishap.</li>
            <li> I usually only use my flat iron for my bangs, but at the price I paid for it there was no way I was going to keep this just for that.  </li>
            <li> I prefer to use my flat iron, &amp; finish off with a regular curling iron.</li>
            <li> This one also seems to get a little too hot, even at the lowest setting, but I still wouldn&#x27;t give it up for any other styler.</li>
            <li> This iron smoothes out any frizz and adds so much SHINE, it&#x27;s unbelievable.</li>
            <li> The practicality is where it depends on the customer, and this is where I feel the product fell flat for me.</li>
            <li> and then flat iron it,</li>
            <li> Also, it leaves my hair too flat</li>
            <li> Lastly, I should&#x27;ve bought this a long time ago.</li>
            <li> And I don&#x27;t always use the flat iron after, it depends.</li>
            <li> You should not leave on the hair in one place for a long time as you may actually burn the hair.</li>
            <li> Curls last long and non damaging.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and recently had it shortened this Summer</li>
            <li> I prefer my old one but after years it broke down</li>
            <li> prefer my Helen of Troy Professional Gold curling iron hands down.  </li>
            <li> one thing a hot iron cannot do is give me lift and volume in the crown of my heavy hair, and this baby DID IT!!</li>
            <li> and I like very flat.</li>
            <li> It actually looks like I just had a hairstylist blow dry</li>
            <li> I am also a single mom and constantly on the go.</li>
            <li> I get some very big sorta loose waves</li>
            <li> So for a long time I&#x27;ve been using a flat iron once my hair was dry.</li>
            <li> (long hair)  </li>
            <li> to long hair.</li>
            <li> Another thing is that it is well made and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Wish I&#x27;d bought it a long time ago.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it if you want it for long use.</li>
            <li> but it still remains long.</li>
            <li> It flattens out after not too long anyway.</li>
            <li> THANK YOU INSTYLER, and what took me so long??</li>
            <li> It really worked wonders on my thick, unmanageable long hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is past my shoulders - not thick at all - dry - color treated</li>
            <li> Both my granddaughter have long thick hair one is naturally curly and one has straight hair with a little bit of wave!</li>
            <li> Flat and crushed.</li>
            <li> then the other present</li>
            <li> The only pro about this thing is it doesn&#x27;t fry my hair as much as other straighteners.</li>
            <li> It looked like it could deliver and was easy enough to use, but I had to be somewhat skeptical because nothing short of my stylist has worked in the past.</li>
            <li> It almost look like my hair after blow and dry at salon.</li>
            <li> it is a bit dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li> After seeing the commercial for the Instyler several times on television, I checked out the website and a few Youtube videos.</li>
            <li> I use flat iron every other day.</li>
            <li> But, sadly, I cannot report that that is true.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to achieve loose “beach style” bouncy curls, that allow my length of hair to still flow</li>
            <li> I mean, I put it on HIGH and let it sit, and I still only ended up with less wave than I had before</li>
            <li> The only thing that I don&#x27;t like very much that it&#x27;s difficult to get close to the hair scalp</li>
            <li> If you have problems curling your hair like me, this is the product for you, for so long I&#x27;ve used flat straightening irons which have only really added small curls that usually fall out after a few hours...</li>
            <li> barrel has a 2-way heating system that features black tourmaline ceramic plates, so you get shine and style at the same time.</li>
            <li> Although I purchased the 1 1/4 barrel it seems smaller than my previous InStyler.  </li>
            <li> Unless I spent $40 for a blow-out at the salon, I was limited to what I could do with my hair.</li>
            <li> but it is clumsy and a little large.</li>
            <li> I can even finish styling my hair in half the time if I were to do it with a flat iron.</li>
            <li> I have shoulder problem and have trouble to use for prolonged time traditional brush and hairdryer styling.</li>
            <li> The results from the styling lasts longer than expected too.</li>
            <li> The only reason it&#x27;s not five stars is because I&#x27;m impatient when it comes to my hair.</li>
            <li> and she of course went with the pink, so</li>
            <li> but it is harder to squeeze onto the hair</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s was I expected.  </li>
            <li> I carefully read the instructions and watched the videos produced by the company.  </li>
            <li> very dry and other days it oily.</li>
            <li> It does though cut down on a lot of time with the flat iron which can only do small pieces at a time.</li>
            <li> It cut my straightening time from a half hour to less than ten minutes.</li>
            <li> With the other one it reaches different sizes, while this one covers the rest and does a few other things with its 2-way rotation.</li>
            <li> I have thick long blonde hair.</li>
            <li> I get no damage from any other heat styler.  </li>
            <li> And it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair &amp;#34;fried&amp;#34; like it was with the other tools.</li>
            <li> Got this to compliment the other inStyler for my wife and they go hand in hand.</li>
            <li> This iron kicks all your other hair styling irons out of your beauty box (or drawer)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There was nothing to cut off here but my other irons.</li>
            <li> There was nothing to cut off here but my other irons.</li>
            <li> I had the other one</li>
            <li> Lastly, overall durability has decreased immensely.</li>
            <li> At least the one that only goes one direction you know which way to hold it.  </li>
            <li> Not worth almost $100.</li>
            <li> It is just not worth the money</li>
            <li> I have thick and coarse curly hair and suffer from frizz.</li>
            <li> If you have thick, coarse and/or curly hair</li>
            <li> Also the noise it makes when the barrel turns gets annoying real quick.</li>
            <li> I have always been curious about the InStyler and can say that in my case, curiosity may has well have killed the cat.</li>
            <li> I waited for the indicator lights to quit blinking and turned the temperature down to two bars.  </li>
            <li> Since then I have always damaged my hair and seemed to be due for a split end trim every 2 months!</li>
            <li> hair is fine-med and very long- past my waist.  </li>
            <li> and I can get it done in 10-15 minutes or less.</li>
            <li> I tried the black colored iron.</li>
            <li> but I burn myself about half the time.</li>
            <li> My hair is long, thick, frizzy, &amp; curly.</li>
            <li> This was a very expensive purchase and I had hoped it would have been worth it.</li>
            <li> I tried it on my hair which is curly but not as tight curls</li>
            <li> and I was getting frustrated with them because the clips were really not the correct size for the rollers(sloppy engineering on the part of the developer of the hot curlers).</li>
            <li> It took a little trial and error working with the turning barrell, but now I got the hang of it.  </li>
            <li> But it basically kinda flattened it out and gave a little flick to the end.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It takes a little time to figure out - &amp;#34;rotate this way with brush out, barrel closest to scalp..</li>
            <li> and I always look for products that allow the curl to be adjusted when it comes to tightness, but also keeps my hair polished with little to no damage.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t make my hair noticeably smoother or shinier, maybe a little softer but not too noticeable.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, coarse, and wavy hair...think doll hair crossed with a horse tail!!</li>
            <li> Hey, we all have crazy ways to make relationships work and no one wants to break a nail over trying to snatch a freebie</li>
            <li> and it lasts for days with just a few touch ups to curl the ends.</li>
            <li> I have managed to avoid straightening my hair everyday for close to two years now.</li>
            <li> I used to go to a salon and pay 30 dollars every time for a shampoo and round brush blow out.</li>
            <li> I feel like I wasted $100...</li>
            <li> (For those curious of my hair type: My hair is medium thick, and curly/wavy.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not available in 220 voltage .i</li>
            <li> This is counting me picking at my style to loosen the curls, spraying a finishing/setting spray, and a few holds, spray, tossing of curls here and there, and creating the framing around my face I desired.</li>
            <li> Not at all what I expected from a $100 curling iron!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overpriced and clumsy.</li>
            <li> What a waste of $75 that now can&#x27;t even be returned.</li>
            <li> VERY unpredictable.</li>
            <li> and maybe that was the problem with me, as my hands are rather small and after doing three long strands my fingers did start to grow tired.  </li>
            <li> My routine is usually to add mousse or cream to my hair after wash and let air-dry.</li>
            <li> A few months ago a noticed that the bristles were slowly falling out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll keep it.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think the brush part would fall off while trying to straighten my hair :\</li>
            <li> I tried it on my son&#x27;s hair, which is a bit past his shoulders, about fine-med like mine, but a bit curlier-</li>
            <li> The end of my hair are pretty damaged so when I would use a regular straightener the end looks horrible and tangled.</li>
            <li> everyday like I have had to!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get what it&#x27;s for and don&#x27;t use it, and I accidentally click it and switch the rotation and have to stop and switch it back, with is a little inconvenient.</li>
            <li> As I moved the Instyler down the length of my hair at a slightly faster pace than shown in the videos, my hair burned within mere seconds.  </li>
            <li> So, two days later my hopes were crushed and I was left with the task of going to UPS for a return as well as a nasty scab mark from the burn on my hairline</li>
            <li> I was obviously previously used which is annoying since I paid for a new one.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time seeing which way the roller is moving.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to master.</li>
            <li> so it was hard to use.  </li>
            <li> And made my hair look dull and fried.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Because of the size and heat, I find that it is hard to get close to the scalp to straighten there or curl to add lift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This at least you can do wider pieces.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to start by confessing I have thick frizzy Hispanic curls.</li>
            <li> I have been embracing my thick curly hair.</li>
            <li> The hardest part was blow-drying my thick hair</li>
            <li> like slowly brushing your hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She has thick wavy hair.</li>
            <li> No thanks !!!!!</li>
            <li> The problem is my hair was looking flat and dirty.  </li>
            <li> It just randomly does it when you press down.</li>
            <li> but so do beauty items and we seriously say things like, “it’s</li>
            <li> When the barrel rolls in the wrong direction it creates a frizzy mess.</li>
            <li> and it actually burned my hair so bad on the ends that I had to trim them.</li>
            <li> If you have curly or dull hair, this is the product for you!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed as I was very keen on using it.</li>
            <li> but I have very thick hair</li>
            <li> this is the worse straighner that i have ever purchased.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable!!!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about buying this tool, because it looked too difficult to use.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately for me it didn&#x27;t work with my hair.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it did not fulfill my hopes.</li>
            <li> Maybe I did it wrong?</li>
            <li> and it would curl my hair the wrong way.  </li>
            <li> the look got worse!</li>
            <li> Nonetheless I did try it since I was contemplating buying, but it&#x27;s quite difficult to use</li>
            <li> Be wary of purchasing this.</li>
            <li> I have combination hair - sounds weird</li>
            <li> As I just cut my hair, it becomes really difficult to curl my hair.</li>
            <li> For $100 Im sad I bought it.</li>
            <li> I just received it in the mail and was highly disappointed to find the seals broken and a piece of hair stuck in the comb.</li>
            <li> but the results were always so disappointing and it would puff out within minutes anyway.</li>
            <li> This one , I&#x27;m so unhappy</li>
            <li> Its awkward to use.</li>
            <li> I was wrong!</li>
            <li> Wrong!</li>
            <li> I found this item very difficult to use for curling purposes.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I order this one and boy was I disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I was incredibly disappointed in this &amp;#34;new&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> - even had to snip off some hair with a pair of scissors :-(</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I hate shine when it looks greasy and nasty, but the InStyler gives my hair a shine that&#x27;s flowy.</li>
            <li> I was fearful of getting my hair tangled in the device, but it never happened, even when I ran it backwards.</li>
            <li> very bad ..</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair feeling unnatural and nasty.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I will definitely recommend this product i buy one store the people donated stuff and I buy for 15 dollars and it was new with the box and plastic and everything and I used on my hair one time and my hair came out really straight and with Shine</li>
            <li> Very easy to use.  I love it!</li>
            <li> Better than a flat iron.</li>
            <li> I like the outlook and how convenient i can make inner curl. but i have try many times to make curls but it doesnt success, and the temperature seems like is not hot enough. Between the rotating sound is quite irritating(noisy)</li>
            <li> This was my third purchase.  It seems they last about  year and then something breaks.  Anyway, I order this one and boy was I disappointed.  I thought with the different barrel it would be more gentle.  I used the older ones on medium to low just because I feel it causes less damage.  I tried this one on the next to the lowest setting and it actually burned my hair so bad on the ends that I had to trim them. (long hair)  I reduced the heat to the lowest setting the next time I got up the nerve to try again and it burned my ends again.  I think this one was defective.  My hair is in great condition.  I get no damage from any other heat styler.  I use flat iron every other day. My old one had a brush crack and had to throw the brush part out but it still functions.  I had to go back to my old one and return this one.</li>
            <li> I bought mine several years ago and was just looking to purchase a spare incase mine breaks. My hair is long, thick, frizzy, &amp; curly. This is the only iron the straightens it and it lasts for days with just a few touch ups to curl the ends. Easy to use and I can get it done in 10-15 minutes or less. Mine however does not reverse the rotating. I am thinking this might be a great option.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about buying this tool, because it looked too difficult to use.  I was wrong! I love the InStyler!! I am so glad that I invested the money in it.  I now use it in place of my straight iron and curling iron.  And it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair &amp;#34;fried&amp;#34; like it was with the other tools. Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter. She really likes it an uses it quite a bit throughout the week. I would recommend it for anyone with med. to long hair. My hair is short, so I do not use it. But it is not harsh on her hair like a curling iron or straightener.</li>
            <li> I just got the Instyler so probably my rating would be 5 stars if I were more efficient in using it. So far I&#x27;m very pleased. It almost look like my hair after blow and dry at salon. I actually went to my friend who is hairstylist and does my hair to ask her what she thought. She complimented me how good job I did. I have shoulder problem and have trouble to use for prolonged time traditional brush and hairdryer styling. This was easy to use and I like that I can use it on dry hair. It does not dry hair like flat iron. I was also able to curl my hair a little at the ends. I have bob cut hairstyle. So far I really like it and can&#x27;t wait to become a pro using that tool. Word of caution, if you have fine hair like I do , start from lower heat setting , also use the guard that is provided. It will not affect the styling but protect your skin from any burns. This might be the best gadget I ever bought.</li>
            <li> Love that I can switch direction with a double click!</li>
            <li> This is my third InStyler but the first with Max 2-Way Rotation. I&#x27;ve loved all three InStylers, but am not too crazy about the 2-way rotation. I don&#x27;t get what it&#x27;s for and don&#x27;t use it, and I accidentally click it and switch the rotation and have to stop and switch it back, with is a little inconvenient. This one also seems to get a little too hot, even at the lowest setting, but I still wouldn&#x27;t give it up for any other styler.</li>
            <li> I was using hot curlers prior to buying this and I was getting frustrated with them because the clips were really not the correct size for the rollers(sloppy engineering on the part of the developer of the hot curlers). So I saw this ad on tv and did some research online and purchased it. It has a little booklet with it that gives you the basics on how to use it and what products you should use with it to get the best results, but it also tells you to watch the online video to see how it actually works on different lengths and thickness of hair. This video was a Godsend for me! I watched it over and over until I felt confident that I was using it correctly to get the best results. I wouldn&#x27;t say I am as good as a hairstylist Lon doing my hair but I sure have gotten tons of compliments on styling job I did.</li>
            <li> An excellent gift for my brother&#x27;s household which consists of a wife and multiple teenage daughters. Being the teenagers they are, they absolutely adore this iron--which they can use for their desires curly hair. To my surprise, I wouldn&#x27;t think that this would cost the price that it is; however my nieces seem to love this new gift of theirs.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it feels great on my hair leaving it soft and shinny.</li>
            <li> Bought this for a wife because she keeps complaining about her old iron. THe product seems to be genuine and was made from really good material. She says this one is way better than her previous iron because it can rotate both way and had it where she likes it. Definitely a win for me</li>
            <li> I found this item very difficult to use for curling purposes. As for the straightening, I saw no difference from my regular $25 straightener</li>
            <li> It definitely got hot quickly. Unfortunately for me it didn&#x27;t work with my hair.  I was recommended this by 2 women (both mixed race) who had naturally curly hair that they relaxed. I have my hair natural and it did not leave a nice finished product. My hair wasn&#x27;t as straight as when I&#x27;d used the Chi flat iron, nor was it as shine. This went back.</li>
            <li> This was a very expensive purchase and I had hoped it would have been worth it. The way it is made is very cheap like, but besides that it just didn&#x27;t work for us. My daughter has very curly hair and we brushed through it then tried this and it didn&#x27;t work any better than the flat iron we had. I tried it on my hair which is curly but not as tight curls and it was the same. So far the return on this has been easy which is a plus</li>
            <li> In my opinion the InStyler max uses less heat than traditional hot tools, and delivers better results. The secret lies in its rotating heated polishing cylinder, tourmaline ceramic floating plate and four rows of precision-aligned bristles When you run the InStyler max rotating hot iron through your hair, the first set of bristles gently sort and separate your hair strands. Then, the rotating heated polishing cylinder gently glides over your hair, polishing, straightening, and styling each strand.</li>
            <li> It made my hair very smooth and shiny.  It gets hot quickly,30 seconds. It is easy to hold. I have a hard time seeing which way the roller is moving.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t blame the product for the burn,though. That was my excitement over finally being able to use this product  Unfortunately, it did not fulfill my hopes. While the product itself knows what it&#x27;s doing I feel like it isn&#x27;t as easy as the commercials said it would be. The InStyler comes with everything you&#x27;d need: InStyler, cooling mat, heat guard, combs, instructions, etc. It knew what problems customers would get into and it prepared very well. The practicality is where it depends on the customer, and this is where I feel the product fell flat for me. I have long, naturally curly Mexican hair that has only been straightened successfully once by a flat iron and someone&#x27;s experienced hands. Since then I&#x27;d dreamed of being able to do that myself, and figured this product would show me the light. While it did &#x27;soothe&#x27; my locks it didn&#x27;t leave them silky, stylish or pretty - just a mess of raggy witch hair. I tried it multiple times and feared i&#x27;d burn my hair off even at the lowest setting. Straightening was a challenge in itself and I feel like it would be easier having someone do it for you, which defeated the purpose from the advertising infomercials. It was rather big and maybe that was the problem with me, as my hands are rather small and after doing three long strands my fingers did start to grow tired.  Despite giving it many tries I failed what I wanted, and realized my hair looked better curled and uncombed than straightened with this thing. I usually only use my flat iron for my bangs, but at the price I paid for it there was no way I was going to keep this just for that.  So, two days later my hopes were crushed and I was left with the task of going to UPS for a return as well as a nasty scab mark from the burn on my hairline my siblings keep taunting me will scar. It wasn&#x27;t for me. Maybe I did it wrong? Probably. Just didn&#x27;t work for me, so don&#x27;t be surprised if it&#x27;s not your thing. Fun to try, but I recommend having someone do it for you to see what can be done with it than trying to wing it yourself. I feel like if I&#x27;d had someone show me what could be done - if anything - with my hair I&#x27;d have been willing to keep going at it. If you&#x27;re looking for that fast alternative you can get on the first try it might be better to stick to your regular straightener as I&#x27;m sure this thing takes a while to master for some people.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to start by confessing I have thick frizzy Hispanic curls. My hair is frizzy and since I dye it blonde it is a bit dry and frizzy. I have managed to avoid straightening my hair everyday for close to two years now. I have been embracing my thick curly hair. But I wanted a straightener for those once in a while occasions where I want to have beautiful straight round brush hair. This Get Instyler is my favorite and a life saver. I used to go to a salon and pay 30 dollars every time for a shampoo and round brush blow out. Not anymore, this Instyler is even easier because you can switch the direction of the rotating wheel to avoid paining your wrist to hold it a certain way. I&#x27;m in love and the time I save from using an original flat iron is amazing! If your thinking this won&#x27;t work for your hair type just give it a try! I&#x27;m so glad I did. I find I only need to use the lowest setting for the heat level and be cautious not to squeeze the hell out of the device because you don&#x27;t want to bend or damage the bristles on the instyler, these are vital to getting perfect results each time! Love LOVE LOVE THIS. Don&#x27;t waste time or money on original flat irons buy this instyler for a beautiful round brush outcome. I&#x27;m even excited I got the purple one lol. Just get it don&#x27;t question it and try for yourself you will love it.</li>
            <li> if purchasing this product please be aware of the plug I have had to purchase an adapter as I live in the UK , this plug in was different compared to other products that I have purchased from the USA this one has two thin pins, so I have not been able to use this product until my delivery for a USA to UK converter adapter comes!!! could have been clearly noted in the description box section or like my Nume curlers supplied me with an adapter!! will review again once I can actually use the product!!</li>
            <li> This item is &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34;.  I used it at a friends house when I didn&#x27;t have my curling iron and thought it was good at curling my ends under without giving me full curls (sometimes I think my stick straight hair looks too 80&#x27;s when curled, it gets big).  But once I received my own, I found that it was too much work for everyday use.  I didn&#x27;t return it and will use it occasionally, but it really  isn&#x27;t worth the effort.  If you have wavy or curly hair and want to straighten it a little (but not all the way straight like a straightening iron would do), I think this is probably a good product.  If you already have pretty straight hair, I think this is too much effort for what you get out of it.  Also, if I had to do over, I would buy the older version that does NOT change direction.  While that seems like it would be a nice feature, there were times when it would change direction and I wouldn&#x27;t know it and it would curl my hair the wrong way.  At least the one that only goes one direction you know which way to hold it.  With this one I felt like I needed to test it before each section to make sure I knew which way it was rotating.</li>
            <li> It took a little trial and error working with the turning barrell, but now I got the hang of it.  It straitens my hair, but I am still going to have to use frizz control on my hair, plus the heat protection.  Overall I am very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> This product does everything. It can give a bunch of different looks, not just a straight hair look. The 2 turn technology in this is very useful and works really well. Because of the different rotations you can use with this product you don&#x27;t have to switch hands. This is the best iron that I have used and it is definitely worth the price I paid for it. I am so happy that I bought this and threw my old hair iron out. This one is so much better!</li>
            <li> I have thick and coarse curly hair and suffer from frizz. This thing is the most incredible hair tool I have ever used! My routine is usually to add mousse or cream to my hair after wash and let air-dry. In high humidity, I have to put it up. I used to try to blow out my hair and then flat iron it, but the results were always so disappointing and it would puff out within minutes anyway. Unless I spent $40 for a blow-out at the salon, I was limited to what I could do with my hair. Until this baby... After seeing the commercial for the Instyler several times on television, I checked out the website and a few Youtube videos. It looked like it could deliver and was easy enough to use, but I had to be somewhat skeptical because nothing short of my stylist has worked in the past. I bought one today and it absolutely works!!! And it is really EASY to use! The hardest part was blow-drying my thick hair beforehand. If you have thick, coarse and/or curly hair and you want it sleek, smooth and STRAIGHT, this product is for you!  *UPDATE: Three days later and this thing is still amazing. It was raining and incredibly humid out today and my hair stood up to the challenge. It stayed straight, no puffing and no frizz. Unbelievable!!!</li>
            <li> Bought it foe the wife she absolutely loves it using it about three times a week to straighten her hair</li>
            <li> great product i bought this from another retailer online and I love how smooth and shiny my hair is after using it! the handle isnt huge so its easy to hold. the rotating barrel really does help to make my hair look absolutely fabulous! The curling attachment it comes with works great as well making my hair have volume and natural looking curls. great item any any woman in your life!</li>
            <li> Had the original and it was too hot, burned my hair. Although this one has 4 heat settings still a little bit too hot. Love the lift and straightening I get with it.</li>
            <li> So yeah. I doubted whether this item actually worked. Risky, since it&#x27;s expensive!&lt;br /&gt;I have never been able to blow dry my hair with a round brush and get that flip affect! So for a long time I&#x27;ve been using a flat iron once my hair was dry. It was better than nothing. But it basically kinda flattened it out and gave a little flick to the end. As I let my hair grow longer the look got worse! Flat and crushed. My hair is naturally straight but the ends and bed head...eh!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This? It actually looks like I just had a hairstylist blow dry it.&lt;br /&gt;It has body and the nice under flip I want!&lt;br /&gt;And it&#x27;s very smooth! My layers look like layers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes a little time to figure out - &amp;#34;rotate this way with brush out, barrel closest to scalp..don&#x27;t click twice or the rotation changes..draw hair away from head to get body too..&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;But once you get it, fast and awesome!&lt;br /&gt;Just like slowly brushing your hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I CAN EVEN DO THE BACK OF MY HEAD, YAY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep your hair conditioned, use a heat protect spray/leave in light conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;Good to go!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And even though this isn&#x27;t marketed as the wet/dry version. I was in a rush and my hair was still slightly damp once, and I still got great results!</li>
            <li> This hair tool works great!  I have fairly fine, straight, lifeless hair and this really gives you a lift and a style! And it is easy to use in a minimal amount of time!  If it can help my dreary head of hair, it should be able to help just about anyone.  I was a little hesitant because of the cost, but it was worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I  like it but not as good as the original</li>
            <li> Love it! I have thick long blonde hair. Which if not careful can be prone to damage quite easily. I am also a single mom and constantly on the go. This is quick and easy. (Once you get used to it) I do however recommend looking up videos online for tips.</li>
            <li> For doing hair straight it is excellent for doing curls it is hard but still working on it</li>
            <li> Well worth the money spent here! If you have problems curling your hair like me, this is the product for you, for so long I&#x27;ve used flat straightening irons which have only really added small curls that usually fall out after a few hours... With this product, It looks as-if it has been professionally curled. It rotates all the way around so I can get to all of my hair from front to back. Top quality and perfect even for those who aren&#x27;t to great with  hair styling.</li>
            <li> I have only had this for 5 months ..it no longer works as well as when I received and you can not contact seller... it...takes longer to do hair...not getting as hot....I expected more.....</li>
            <li> Both my granddaughter have long thick hair one is naturally curly and one has straight hair with a little bit of wave! It works well for both smooths out the waves and controls the frizzieness of natural curly! Good product!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to master. I have several tools and this has been the hardest to master. Also, it leaves my hair too flat</li>
            <li> Got this for my girlfriend as her birthday was coming up and decided this would be decent present to go with something else I got her. She end up almost liking this more then the other present I got her thanks to the ease of use with this curler. She also liked the different options for hair type that were available that was a nice feature also.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my wife because she needed a new hairstyler. She really enjoys using this and has complimented me on a great purchase and because of the money that I spent, I&#x27;ve complimented myself as well. Really good value for the money and a great suggestion for any gift for a woman who&#x27;s here comes before anything or anybody else.</li>
            <li> Did curl my hair at all</li>
            <li> Not the greatest hair appliance I&#x27;ve ever used, by far. I prefer to use my flat iron, &amp; finish off with a regular curling iron. I get better results. I feel like I wasted $100...</li>
            <li> great and easy to use thank you InStyer. you made my life easy.</li>
            <li> The original was wonderful.This version has a tinny sounding motor, like a toy car. Although this one has more heat settings than the original even low sometimes fries my hair. I loved the original. This one I would pass on.</li>
            <li> I have owned an Instyler since its infomercial origins in 2009. A few months ago a noticed that the bristles were slowly falling out. After several years of loyal service I thought, &amp;#34;Hey, you&#x27;ve gotten more than your money&#x27;s worth! Go ahead and their it out.&amp;#34; I bought the max for two reasons, the color and the dual rotating barrel. I was incredibly disappointed in this &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; Instyler.&lt;br /&gt;1. It doesn&#x27;t get nearly as hot as the old. The highest temperature setting does not match the max on the old, so it doesn&#x27;t actually straighten my hair as quickly. Because of the increased amount of passes and the slower process I felt I was damaging my African American hair far more than I had in the past.&lt;br /&gt;2. The dual rotating barrel often changes direction during the straightening process for to the tapping feature. When the barrel rolls in the wrong direction it creates a frizzy mess. I would have actual preferred just flipping a switch to change direction.&lt;br /&gt;3. The bristles aren&#x27;t had sturdy or numerous as my old Instyler, so the results aren&#x27;t as smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I wish I had my old go to back. I&#x27;m giving it two stars because my bff actually bought the traditional one from Target, and I found that it is pretty comparable to the one I purchased years ago. The &amp;#34;max&amp;#34; just isn&#x27;t for me</li>
            <li> I just received it in the mail and was highly disappointed to find the seals broken and a piece of hair stuck in the comb. I was obviously previously used which is annoying since I paid for a new one. The tag was already ripped off the instyler and crumpled up in the box along with the warranty.  Nonetheless I did try it since I was contemplating buying, but it&#x27;s quite difficult to use and it didn&#x27;t smooth out my hair as it advertised. Be wary of purchasing this.</li>
            <li> I never take the time to write reviews. However, I am very impressed and satisfied with this product for many reasons:  1) I have combination hair - sounds weird I know- sometimes it&#x27;s very dry and other days it oily. It can be curly some days and wavy the next. VERY unpredictable. With the Instyler I can have the same hair perfect hairstyle every time! Super dependable when I need a fixer upper.  2) Previously, I had owned many hair straighteners and finally settled on a Chi. I was heat styling my hair since high school. Since then I have always damaged my hair and seemed to be due for a split end trim every 2 months! With the Instyler my ends are silky smooth and not burnt, damaged or crushed like beetle legs. I now know I can go longer in between hair cuts when using the right hair heat styling protective products.  3) Lastly, I should&#x27;ve bought this a long time ago. You will save time and money! Get the most out of the Instyler by watching tutorials and reading the directions carefully and taking safety precautions. The tool gets pretty darn hot!</li>
            <li> I get excellent smoothing results with this item and it&#x27;s fast.</li>
            <li> After reading reviews and watching a couple videos on YouTube I was convinced this would work on my naturally curly, frizzy hair.  But, sadly, I cannot report that that is true.  I feel like my curls are just too much for this and gave up after only 2 tries.  I&#x27;ll stick to my $15.00 2 inch barrel iron to get the result I like.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Going to get one more, I like it that much, and the color also...</li>
            <li> Returned! Not the same as I&#x27;ve had before.</li>
            <li> I like it. I wouldn&#x27;t say I love it but I do like it. I still have to sometimes use my flat iron on top of certain spots afterwards, still getting used to it. It does though cut down on a lot of time with the flat iron which can only do small pieces at a time. This at least you can do wider pieces. And I don&#x27;t always use the flat iron after, it depends.</li>
            <li> This was purchased for our daughter to help with curling her hair and adding volume. It works really well but as always you have to develop the correct technique for it to produce the best results...not as easy as the commercials suggest. You should not leave on the hair in one place for a long time as you may actually burn the hair. Also highly recommended to use the hair conditioner before using the Instyler to curl your hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased mine years ago (not on Amazon though). I LOVE mine, it&#x27;s the best hair styling tool ever. I have long wavy and very frizzy hair and have tried many different types of hair styling tools and products. I would recommend this to anyone. It&#x27;s easy to use and I have always had great results. Another thing is that it is well made and lasts a long time. The results from the styling lasts longer than expected too.</li>
            <li> I was vey excited when I first started using it, until it shut off by itself. And it stopped working ever&lt;br /&gt;since. I&#x27;m very sure that the problem wasn&#x27;t from my power bar. I&#x27;m very disappointed as I was very keen on using it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get hot enough so it doesn&#x27;t really do anything for frizzy thick hair. Better off with just a flat iron. Also the noise it makes when the barrel turns gets annoying real quick. 2 stars for the easy return.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product!! It turns my curly frizzy hair intro straight and shiny hair. Wish I&#x27;d bought it a long time ago. The two way roller makes things super easy.</li>
            <li> I have really mixed emotions about this product.  I absolutely loved it at first.  I could straighten my hair, about 50% gray, in 30 minutes!  But with continued use, I noticed my hair was looking flat and super shiny, like it had too much product in it.  I tried using the lowest heat setting, but that didn&#x27;t make a difference.  I think it&#x27;s the same effect as when you iron clothes on too high a setting, it melts the fabric and makes it look shiny.  The problem is my hair was looking flat and dirty.  I stopped using it for a couple of weeks and my hair seems to be getting back to normal.  I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll keep it.  I may only be able to use it occasionally if it&#x27;s going to melt my hair.</li>
            <li> If you have curly or dull hair, this is the product for you!  Easy to use and does a great job. One caution, use the Heat guard and dont use the highest setting until you&#x27;re used to it.</li>
            <li> Love this soooo much~ I can&#x27;t describe how much I love this. The only reason it&#x27;s not five stars is because I&#x27;m impatient when it comes to my hair. It takes me a few runs to get it as straight as I like. But other than that this is a wonderful product :3</li>
            <li> WARNING !!! This is a joke why would you put plastic silver by the barrel ???? I have bought four or five Instylers before and they usually last a couple of years BUT ! This one , I&#x27;m so unhappy and I only had it 21/2 months and returning it . Never buy this one again, oh and the melted plastic piece has taken a lot of hair with it . No thanks !!!!!</li>
            <li> This has got to be my go to tool for straightening my hair. I&#x27;ve always used ceramic flat irons, and more so lately,the flat irons just dry and split my ends. It leaves my hair feeling unnatural and nasty. The InStyler, however, leaves my hair so smooth and silky. I hate shine when it looks greasy and nasty, but the InStyler gives my hair a shine that&#x27;s flowy. My hair looks feathery! I can even finish styling my hair in half the time if I were to do it with a flat iron. I love it!  I definitely recommend this item to everyone! I was hesitant at first because it was premiered on an infomercial. In the end I&#x27;m happy I made my purchase!  (For those curious of my hair type: My hair is medium thick, and curly/wavy. It&#x27;s also color treated.)</li>
            <li> This is a really neat product. In the past I have only used flat irons but this works really well for making nice waves in hair. It is easy to use and looks impressive in my bathroom. People think it is some kind of professional tool and it is such a great deal. Lots of things you can do with this.</li>
            <li> This product works well! After I bought it, I ended up cutting my hair shorter so it would not do as good as my regular straightener.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s excellent product ..the problem it&#x27;s not available in 220 voltage .i wish they made 2 kind of voltage 110&amp;220</li>
            <li> Makes curling way better experience. Got this to compliment the other inStyler for my wife and they go hand in hand. With the other one it reaches different sizes, while this one covers the rest and does a few other things with its 2-way rotation. Curls last long and non damaging. The price is worth it as I found this was a quality piece and is very well made. I would recommend it if you want it for long use. Recommend all day!</li>
            <li> I have been watching and drooling over the Instyler hot iron commercials for a while now. Always wondering how it worked, does it work, to will my hair end up needing to be cut out at attempting the first curl. A girl wonders these things :) and even with such in mind, you bet I still wanted to try it because beauty equals bravery in my book when it comes to new products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Un Rato Juntas and Instyler, was kind enough to not only send me one to try but also one to share. The hardest part was picking what color I should keep. I figure I first try it out and then share my results with my BFF of the month. I have two and I figure I alternate months on BFF status as to what freebies I share with them. We all agreed that friendship matters but so do beauty items and we seriously say things like, “it’s May and my month, so I get it”. Hey, we all have crazy ways to make relationships work and no one wants to break a nail over trying to snatch a freebie….that would be uncivilized!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to let my BFF of the month decide on color and she of course went with the pink, so I tried the black colored iron. The Instyler Max features:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No waiting time because within 30 seconds, the rapid heat-up system is ready to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s a hot iron and a curling iron, all in one tool.  You can obtain soft curls that are loose and bouncy, to tight curls and even straight hair styles. This iron kicks all your other hair styling irons out of your beauty box (or drawer)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The barrel has a 2-way heating system that features black tourmaline ceramic plates, so you get shine and style at the same time. The smooth styles you create will remain gorgeous without damaging your hair. No one wants a crispy look!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Instyler iron has an auto-shut off safety feature, in case you get a text or walk out the door too soon because you are eager to show off your new style. Shiny and gorgeous hair locks can do that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have several settings to choose from when it comes to your hair’s texture. You can choose from Fine, Medium, to Thick or Coarse hair. With four heat settings that have a maximum heat setting of 425 degrees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How does it Perform:&lt;br /&gt;The Instyler Max Rotating Iron is a gorgeous piece of hardware but I’m not just leaving it on the counter to just show-off. This baby has to work and treat my hair nice, plus keep whatever style I choose looking fresh and vibrant. Curling takes time and I always look for products that allow the curl to be adjusted when it comes to tightness, but also keeps my hair polished with little to no damage. I figure we are in the day and age that technology should deliver such! I have long hair and recently had it shortened this Summer but it still remains long. I wanted to achieve loose “beach style” bouncy curls, that allow my length of hair to still flow but with a kick. I took the iron out of the package and once I became familiar with the literature included, I was able to start within 5 minutes and the Instyler was ready to go before I was in under a minute! Okay, it knows me and knows I don’t like to wait. I quickly began and my first lock of hair went in and the barrel began to softly rotate as it pulled more hair length in. Okay, I get it! This beauty tool not only straightens but quickly created a soft curl without losing one strand of hair. I felt nothing pull out of my scalp and in less than 5 seconds (I have fine hair but lots of it), I was done. Each hair strand really gets the royalty treatment and I was done in 10 minutes. This is counting me picking at my style to loosen the curls, spraying a finishing/setting spray, and a few holds, spray, tossing of curls here and there, and creating the framing around my face I desired. I was set and done and most importantly……super happy with the results. Like I found myself saying I should have done this before and even lecturing myself why I don’t style my hair like this more often. Yeah, I forgot that I now have the tool to easily do it with and this is why I avoided it. Avoid no more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final Verdict:&lt;br /&gt;I have always stated that all-in-one products most of the times do none at all well enough. Today, I’m sort of having to chew on that last statement. The Instyler Max Rotating Iron performed well and as advertised, but it’s one of those things you have to try yourself to believe. I sure didn’t at first and there is a reason I have scissors in my drawer in case of a mishap. I’m a cut-it-off before it singes my scalp kind of gal. There was nothing to cut off here but my other irons. It’s easier making room for one tool and I knew I had a problem with hair tools when I had to Swiffer the dust periodically off the tools I rarely use. Keeping them in case doom’s day comes, telling myself I better use them because I have to justify the purchase…….whatever reason I could come up with but now my reason is really talking to myself about what style I want and I can’t wait for colder weather to arrive and have hair that looks fabulous and shines!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the above product(s) free of charge from Un Rato Juntas and Instyler.  I am not obligated to provide a positive or favorable review, just my honest opinion.  My review is based on my experience with the product and/or brand, which may differ from yours.re often.

            <li> Let it be known that I have the original Instyler and love it!! Buy it instead!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I figured I&#x27;d upgrade in order to get the new version which supposedly would get 10 degrees hotter (425 vs 415) which would come in handy for my thick, coarse hair. First of all, I can tell no difference in temperatures. If this device gets hotter, it could&#x27;ve fooled me. Second of all, this device is supposed to have rapid heat up. However, it still takes several minutes to heat up at start-up. I guess maybe it returns to max heat between uses a bit quicker than the original, but it does not seem to make a difference. Lastly, overall durability has decreased immensely. I accidentally dropped the new model on the floor, and one of the brushes broke off. This did not happen when I dropped the original.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, stick with the original. The &amp;#34;Max&amp;#34; version is not an upgrade. Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Easy to use excellent product!</li>
            <li> Works well. Just heard to squeeze when curling hair.</li>
            <li> It works but I didn&#x27;t think the brush part would fall off while trying to straighten my hair :\</li>
            <li> Love it, very important to watch the videos and U tube posts for tips to get the best results. Highly recommended it. Betty B.</li>
            <li> I used to use the Remington Wet-2-Straight straightener for about 6 years then it finally gave out, and I decided to give the InStyler a try. I don&#x27;t understand all the hype. It didn&#x27;t make my hair noticeably smoother or shinier, maybe a little softer but not too noticeable. It can give some volume but mostly just gives you a bump in your hair. It flattens out after not too long anyway. So far blowdrying my hair is the only cure I found for flat hair. It&#x27;s a pain in the butt to straighten bangs and sometimes tangles it all up for some reason. It&#x27;s also more difficult to get pin straight hair because it curves the hair in especially with short hair. I think this product is good for people who want that curved in look. The only pro about this thing is it doesn&#x27;t fry my hair as much as other straighteners. Not worth almost $100. Probably will go back to Remington.</li>
            <li> Works OK just wish ut had more heat settings than one at this price.</li>
            <li> I just tried the 2-way Instyler (Purple, 1.25&amp;#34;) after using the Original for years. It took me 2+ hours to do my hair (longish) as opposed to 45-60 mins with the Original - I do have thick, wavy/unmanageable hair, but that&#x27;s not an excuse for why it took so long. Its highest heat setting definitely does not get as hot as the Original - strange, because it&#x27;s supposed to go up to 425 F vs 410 F on the Original. And don&#x27;t get me started on the 2-way feature - it was supposed to make my life easier, but I think the reason it took me so long to do my hair was because the barrel changed directions on me so many times, and this, without my consciously double-tapping it. I admit it&#x27;s a bit of a learning curve, but my hair also did get caught on the edge of the barrel several times, and I lost more than a few strips of hair to entanglement - even had to snip off some hair with a pair of scissors :-( This NEVER happened to me with the Original. The bristles on this are flimsier too than on the Original... Overall, I wanted to love it, and give it a chance, but it&#x27;s back to the Original for me. It really worked wonders on my thick, unmanageable long hair.</li>
            <li> The instyler is good, but not great. I prefer the original. So yeah it&#x27;s a bit hotter than the original but it is harder to squeeze onto the hair and it gets stuck on the edge point of it breaking my hair. I prefer my old one but after years it broke down and i needed a new one. I won&#x27;t return it cause its working and ... whatever, you can&#x27;t be too picky. I&#x27;m happy with my instyler. My hair is bouncy again. ;)</li>
            <li> InStyler works great.  I needed something to straighten my hair and it works better than anything I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
            <li> The minute it was delivered to the door . I opened it and started using it. How wonderful to finally have a styling tool that cuts down half the time  in doing or styling your hair; but very easy to use. Surprised it took me this long to get one. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be using a flatiron ever again. It was also a great price. I Love it!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t rave enough about this tool! I have short naturally curly hair, but of course it never curls the way I would like it to, until now. This iron smoothes out any frizz and adds so much SHINE, it&#x27;s unbelievable. Outstanding product!</li>
            <li> Love this..kinda difficult to use at first but it gets very hot..love it!</li>
            <li> So far so good. Easy to use and makes my hair smooth and curly without looking like sherley temple.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Love how easy it is to use!</li>
            <li> OMG love this product!!!! works so well! :) makes my hair look nice and I feel it&#x27;s soooo much better than using a curling iron everyday. Follow the instructions and watch a couple youtube videos. This works differently depending on your hair volume. My hair is past my shoulders - not thick at all - dry - color treated and I wash it about 5 days a week. The &amp;#34;InStyler&amp;#34; is the best thing ever!! I actually may buy another one !! :) lol</li>
            <li> Not crazy about this product at all. From the videos touting how easily and quickly you can have flawless shiny hairstyles I thought the product would work much better than it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m also not at all impressed by the cheap construction of the iron. Except for the barrel it&#x27;s mostly plastic. Not at all what I expected from a $100 curling iron!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overpriced and clumsy. I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love that this rolls both way.  I had the other one and I do my hair different so it was hard to use.  This one is wonderful.</li>
            <li> this is the worse straighner that i have ever purchased. dont buy this product you will regret it.</li>
            <li> love this iron, easy to use, hair become smooth and silky</li>
            <li> I love it for big curl!  It&#x27;s perfect and it&#x27;s really easy to use it!    it&#x27;s was I expected.  I will recommend more for big curls. To straight is good too but I have very thick hair and I like very flat. The only thing that I don&#x27;t like very much that it&#x27;s difficult to get close to the hair scalp so I can not get very flat my hair from the root, other them that It&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> This actually works for my long curly hair and is a nice change from my regular flat iron.  I like the rotating two way aspect too.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this tool.</li>
            <li> Product as described-No issues with Seller</li>
            <li> I had the original InStyler and LOVED it.  This newer version just doesn&#x27;t seem the same.  Although I purchased the 1 1/4 barrel it seems smaller than my previous InStyler.  Already tossed the packaging or I would return it to get the original. Oh well...</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair between my chin and shoulder. This works okay but nothing special. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again for my hair. It is nice that you can keep the heat low for fine hair but honestly it doesn&#x27;t do any better than a blow dry with a round brush. I think it is no doubt best for girls with long hair.</li>
            <li> Did not do what I expected....returned it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for a friends after many years of wanting an InStyler. The commercials state and show that it works for all types of hair. Wrong! I sent this &amp;#34;wonderful&amp;#34; gift to à friend and she tried it just waiting for her hair to look like the ad models and nothing. It doesn&#x27;t rotate two ways as promised and it doesn&#x27;t by any means get ethnic hair as nicely coiffed as it claims. What a waste of $75 that now can&#x27;t even be returned.</li>
            <li> Really like the this tool. It gives me nice shape around my face but I burn myself about half the time. I&#x27;ve used it about a dozen times it gets very HOT. It can leave blisters DO NOT leave it where a child can touch it.</li>
            <li> This item was purchased as a gift. so far I have no complains.</li>
            <li> As I just cut my hair, it becomes really difficult to curl my hair. maybe it works better when I have longer hair.</li>
            <li> Got this for the wife as part of her Christmas present.  She absolutely hates it (especially after having wanted it for so long).  The device costs too much for what it does (which is pretty much nothing).  She already had a straightening iron from Chi which does great on the straightening.  She had read some reviews and thought this might add some volume.  It doesn&#x27;t.  It just gives a final look that makes it look like you tried to straighten your hair, but didn&#x27;t do a very good job at it....</li>
            <li> I love this product ! It makes my hair so healthy looking</li>
            <li> very bad .. after two month, I sound noise from it.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it and her hair looks great when she uses it.</li>
            <li> So great for my thick, wavy hair! I LOVE how it brushes as it goes, it keeps the frizz down and help me manage tangles as I go, instead of having to stop here and there to brush down my uncurled hair. Makes beautiful curls and waves, plus it tooks great! Gets really hot but has not burned my hair. Excellent product!</li>
            <li> By far the best curling iron on the market</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work worth anything. And made my hair look dull and fried. My diamond plated straightener off groupon works MUCH nicer than this did. Not to mention it was a pain in the rear to get it to spin the right direction. Theres not a switch to make it switch direction. It just randomly does it when you press down.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine so it didn&#x27;t work for me</li>
            <li> A great hair styling tool!</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying that Vocalpoint provided me with free products in exchange for an honest review. I have very thick, coarse, and wavy hair...think doll hair crossed with a horse tail!! When I flat iron my hair, it takes about thirty minutes,  because I have to section-section-section and go over each section with the flat iron followed by a brush...THIRTY MINUTES, and I am quick, adept and fast! Imagine my surprise after trying the  MAX 2-Way Rotating Iron - this thing is AMAZING!! I was able to do my whole head in 12 minutes, and my hair is waist-length! I was fearful of getting my hair tangled in the device, but it never happened, even when I ran it backwards. WHEW!!! one thing a hot iron cannot do is give me lift and volume in the crown of my heavy hair, and this baby DID IT!! THANK YOU INSTYLER, and what took me so long?? My photos tell the entire lovely story!</li>
            <li> Still learning how to use it, but it&#x27;s great!  Received order quickly!</li>
            <li> It had an American plug apart from that. They are very good  just had. To buy a. Abdapter  good idea to put shield on it as I burnt my forehead</li>
            <li> I was so excited about getting this.  I think it is an appliance that will work for some, but for me, I&#x27;ve got better things.  It does straighten well, and quickly.  I love how fast it heats up and I can just zip through my hair to straighten it.  I like that it brushes while it straightens.  It seems to add a bit of shine and smoothing too.  It makes my hair look neater.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is fine-med and very long- past my waist.  My hair has gentle waves. This will not curl it- I get some very big sorta loose waves but my hair has those naturally.  I mean, I put it on HIGH and let it sit, and I still only ended up with less wave than I had before I started.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next I tried it on my son&#x27;s hair, which is a bit past his shoulders, about fine-med like mine, but a bit curlier- his falls in cork screw ringlets.  As a straightener, it went right through his hair and quickly straightened it.  I was able to get a bit of flip on the ends of his hair.  I never could on mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of the size and heat, I find that it is hard to get close to the scalp to straighten there or curl to add lift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer my Helen of Troy Professional Gold curling iron hands down.  I&#x27;ve got a Remington S7231 Wet to Straight Straightener that I like better too.  Personally I don&#x27;t find it a good value, though I suspect it works better for some hair than others.  I&#x27;d rather have 2 really good tools than one that only does half of what it says it does on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest if you can, try it before buying, or make sure you can return it, in case you are like me, and your hair just sits and spins on it without doing anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Max version has a barrel that changes directions.  It takes a double tap click click to make it change directions.  I found that easy to change.  I understand this is an improvement on the older model that did not change directions.</li>
            <li> When I first heard of the InStyler I thought it was just some gimmick. Then I saw the price and thought that maybe I could just go about things the old fashion way. Then I went over a friends house and she just so happen to own a InStyler. Hearing her rave about it made me more curious on how it performs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I took a leap of faith and needless to say I am happy I did. Never did I think that a product that received a lot of hype actually proved to be true. Guess it goes to show that it pays at time to believe what everyone says as it just may be true.</li>
            <li> I carefully read the instructions and watched the videos produced by the company.  There is no way to set the temperature when turning on the device; it automatically heats up to the maximum (level 4) temperature.  I waited for the indicator lights to quit blinking and turned the temperature down to two bars.  I sectioned off the amount of hair as per the written instructions and applied the Instyler to my hair.  Thank goodness I also followed the directions to start with the undermost layer of hair.  As I moved the Instyler down the length of my hair at a slightly faster pace than shown in the videos, my hair burned within mere seconds.  I had to cut off 5 inches of that section of my hair.  I have used several different brands of flat irons over the years without mishap. If you buy the Instyler, be sure to start with a layer of hair that you won&#x27;t mind having to cut off. Caveat emptor.</li>
            <li> I bought this from another site but I love it! The end of my hair are pretty damaged so when I would use a regular straightener the end looks horrible and tangled. When I use the insyler my ends look great! You can&#x27;t even tell my hair is damaged. I have curly hair and I&#x27;ve never had a problem with it! Had it for about 6 months now!</li>
            <li> Works very good lots better than the other roller one .</li>
            <li> I like it but it is clumsy and a little large.</li>
            <li> Love this item came as promised better then expected</li>
            <li> It takes a little bit of practice to get good with it but I think it is great.  I have very fine straight hair.  I much prefer this to a regular curling iron as it gives a more natural look - not so rigid.  The longer I use it the better I get with it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t care for the rotation movement. You can&#x27;t clip it down on your hair to secure hair in first without rotation motion turning on. Ended up tangling hair a lot. As soon as you squeeze the brush together it turns the rotating motion on. I like to get my hair somewhat in place before it starts smoothing or curling. Just not the right tool for me.</li>
            <li> Good and fast shipping!!! I loved the product!!!!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t got the curl that I wanted</li>
            <li> Wow, WORKS GREAT! Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I have very curly, wavy thick hair and was so happy to finally find a product that semi-straightens my hair quickly! Using a straightener takes me a good hour and I was able to work through all of my hair within 20 minutes and head to work!</li>
            <li> Nice product and I loved it so much! This is 120V, 60 watt then I need the transformers to use in Asia.</li>
            <li> wires one that I pay it&#x27;s not useful or good I regret pay it , my hand heard and burn do not west you money on this pay Hair straightener</li>
            <li> I thought its supposed to be the best in the world. Thats what the package says anyways. I bought it for my wife. She has thick wavy hair. She says it works &amp;#34;&amp;#34;ok&amp;#34;. For $100 Im sad I bought it. Will give her the money next time so she can choose her own and I wont feel bummed.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST hair styling tool EVER!  I didn&#x27;t even have to read the directions it&#x27;s so easy!  Straightens your hair so fast it&#x27;s nuts!  I am in love with this thing, and highly recommend it for girls that have curly hair and have to flat iron their hair everyday like I have had to!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. I do not get the results as seen in videos.Can easily burn scalp/fingers. Its awkward to use. For my hair I think a heated brush (like a Calista Tools  brand) would be better. I am familiar with all types of hair tools. This one is not user friendly</li>
            <li> Bought the max because it rotates both ways, I bought the original two years ago and love it so when I found out there was one that rotated both ways I had to have it and like the first one I love it and the new two rotation direction makes styling easier and faster.  This thing makes my hair shiny, bouncy, silky and it looks healthy and it is the only styling tool that I will ever use.</li>
            <li> I have always been curious about the InStyler and can say that in my case, curiosity may has well have killed the cat. The Max is beautiful, love the purple, but it does nothing for my hair. When using my normal flatiron, at least the ends look nice. With the InStyler, it looked like the ends were sticking out and I did not spin it in that direction. It is just not worth the money so I have started the return/refund process.</li>
            <li> Love!  Love!  Love!  This is my second InStyler (first Max), and I just love them.  I have super curly hair, and these are the only tools I can use to get it straight.&lt;br /&gt;Worth every penny!!</li>
            <li> I love this thing! One of the best gifts I&#x27;ve gotten. It cut my straightening time from a half hour to less than ten minutes.</li>
