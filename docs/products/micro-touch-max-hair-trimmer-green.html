            <li>I AM CLEAN!!!  </li>
            <li>There is nothing good to say about this product.</li>
            <li>Good Product</li>
            <li>and it looked good</li>
            <li>Some people say they replace this every three to five years, making it a good bargain.</li>
            <li>The seller did a good job getting the item to me though.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also discovered that on spots where there&#x27;s a good patch of hair it will jam up and stop working.  </li>
            <li>Item does a fair job of removing hair.  </li>
            <li>Good product for grooming tasks</li>
            <li>Good for nose, ears, sideburns etc..</li>
            <li>but the prduct is good</li>
            <li>It worked fairly well on nasal hair</li>
            <li>To be honest it doesn&#x27;t work as great as it looks on tv.</li>
            <li>when it worked, it did a fair job.</li>
            <li>Good stuff...</li>
            <li>I thought this would be a good trimmer for vacations, but I tried it and with a days growth on my face, it would not cut it.</li>
            <li>Works good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, the product at this price point is a good buy in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>Good Luck trying to return it.</li>
            <li>It was a good price.  </li>
            <li>and it was a fair price.</li>
            <li>I was very happy with the original MicroTouch</li>
            <li>Happy with item and purchased more.  </li>
            <li>I am very glad I didn&#x27;t pay for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Glad I bought it &amp; the price was great.</li>
            <li>Bought it as a gift and the recipient was very satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>excellent if it meets the expectations and good product delivered on time in my locker in miami, good seller, thanks</li>
            <li>Pulls the hair out more than it cuts!</li>
            <li>I thought it would work more than once!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m planning to get more of it!</li>
            <li>A cheap piece of trash, not as advertised,DO NOT BUY !!</li>
            <li>The light is great as an added feature and I can take it anywhere</li>
            <li>Thanks for a very great product.</li>
            <li>Not as effective as a nose hair trimmer as hoped.  </li>
            <li>Conceptually it&#x27;s a nice idea, but the quality isn&#x27;t there, so I would avoid this product.</li>
            <li>Women, this is a nice gift to give your man.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to keep one in each bathroom and a couple in travel kits.</li>
            <li>Had one before and liked it.&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li>I received this Micro Touch Max trimmer in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li>Nice product.</li>
            <li>I own Panasonic Pivoting Head trimmer which I use to sculpt my \\&quot;sideburns\\&quot; in between hair appointments.</li>
            <li>Kind Regards,   Citlaly   </li>
            <li>I liked the product when it worked</li>
            <li>Was nicely packaged as well.</li>
            <li>and I doubt there is anything deluxe about the one I received which is supose to be</li>
            <li>It kind of works if you don&#x27;t use any of the adapters.  </li>
            <li>Now he has he own and loves it.  </li>
            <li>The product is good and if it wasn&#x27;t for the battery being gone out of the package I would have given it a better review.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great and useful for us to do good by</li>
            <li>best product I have found on  the market thus far...works great, get into those hard to reach places and the service was great.</li>
            <li>Worked fine, great idea but the quality of the product needs to be better.</li>
            <li>sure could have made this better, but for six bucks it&#x27;s a fair deal.</li>
            <li>perfectly fine and good.</li>
            <li>product arrived on time and are very good, a responsible person is recommended.</li>
            <li>but what good is it to have the light shine on hair that isn&#x27;t being removed-</li>
            <li>bright light lets you see what you&#x27;re doing.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>even though it is a controversial rating, I&#x27;m giving these four stars because the price matches the quality and they do work.</li>
            <li>Worked great when I first received.</li>
            <li>This item is very cheap.  </li>
            <li>The quality of the trimmer itself is very cheap.</li>
            <li>product is very cheaply made and does not work well.</li>
            <li>Would not cut hairs, was very cheap and broke after about 3 minutes of use.</li>
            <li>Very cheaply made.  </li>
            <li>very cheaply put</li>
            <li>I always try to give an honest and fair review stating positive and negatives.</li>
            <li>Much better than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>and this one works better.</li>
            <li>with no guarantee that the replacement will be any better.</li>
            <li>That said, it&#x27;s better than others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>sure helps when doing the ears,worth the money.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t complain really because it works great</li>
            <li>I would have gladly paid more for a better product.</li>
            <li>I bought this solely for trimming my eyebrows, which is probably the most it could handle anyways.</li>
            <li>I turned it off and was pleased.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had cheaper that was better made.</li>
            <li>About the equivalent length of time, at most?</li>
            <li>It did struggle with more course hair like the neck and side burns.</li>
            <li>I have found it to perform really well, and be a great maintenance tool.  </li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>/&gt;After using the Micro Touch, the family members decided it was OK and rated it at 3 stars.</li>
            <li>kit comes with so much more.</li>
            <li>They are ultra-cheap tweezers that don&#x27;t work any better than if I used my fingernails.&lt;br</li>
            <li>love the light!  </li>
            <li>Maybe it just need better directions, but I don&#x27;t get it...</li>
            <li>I HAVE WAS BETTER....</li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s the way it is with many products</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather spend more money and buy a better one</li>
            <li>Cuts ok</li>
            <li>Better off looking at a Norelco and/or a Wahl....</li>
            <li>and we all had a good laugh about it</li>
            <li>That said, it is not as \\&quot;safe to the touch\\&quot; as the ads claim.</li>
            <li>, yes it&#x27;s safe to touch.\\&quot;  -</li>
            <li>Panasonic trimmer allows me to make them as cute looking as my hairdresser.</li>
            <li>and it really works great.</li>
            <li>The power, what there is comes and goes, but it is mostly gone.  </li>
            <li>plus I would have to pay the return shipping which I doubt would be more than $6.</li>
            <li>Most nose hair trimmers have a removable head which can be washed; this doesn&#x27;t and is unsanitary because it cannot be washed.</li>
            <li>In truth I thought was bringing more accessories.</li>
            <li>So I tried it again, this time more vigorously.  </li>
            <li>My husband is gonna love this gift.  </li>
            <li>If I were in the market for a trimmer, I would pass this by and look for something with more quality.</li>
            <li>Micro Touch itself works OK.  </li>
            <li>Sure they could have made the build quality along the lines of the  [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>but it works ok.</li>
            <li>But, there are much better products out there.</li>
            <li>Although this trimmer has some nice attachments and features, its just too damn cheap.</li>
            <li>Works OK.</li>
            <li>nothing more don&#x27;t trust</li>
            <li>Have bought 2 of these and neither one lasted more than a week.</li>
            <li>Nice but cheap shaver.</li>
            <li>It came in a pouch with some very nice finger and toe nail clippers, some attachments, and a carrying case for the whole system.  </li>
            <li>I cut my own hair and had problems maintaining a clean look around my ears..</li>
            <li>I loved doing my eyebrows for the first time in my life by myself!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll</li>
            <li>The Micro Touch Max Trimmer seems to work pretty good.</li>
            <li>And if it works, it&#x27;s actually a pretty good deal.</li>
            <li>At first it looks like a good product.  </li>
            <li>Pretty good for the money.</li>
            <li>Clearing a hairy area in a dry mode is probably the best use of it.</li>
            <li>The LED light is nice, but doesn&#x27;t light up the correct</li>
            <li>Works ok, but light did not work and could perform better</li>
            <li>This is very true for this product.</li>
            <li>Well, safe to touch is accurate.  </li>
            <li>i had used the old micro touch trimmer for years and it was great.  </li>
            <li>I used finishing touch prior which I liked mostly lasted a good 3 years.  </li>
            <li>I use this for trimming nose hair (primarily) and i find it does a better job than the rotary nose hair clippers.&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li>In a way that&#x27;s fitting, because the Micro Touch Max is cheaply made.  </li>
            <li>In a way that&#x27;s fitting, because the Micro Touch Max is cheaply made.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s capable of taking off a good amount of hair.</li>
            <li>This one works like a charm - powerful motor, excellent blades, solid construction.</li>
            <li>Overall, for $3, I&#x27;m happy that it does something, but I wouldn&#x27;t pay $1 more.</li>
            <li>The unit comes apart for cleaning, and that&#x27;s fairly easy.  </li>
            <li>The unit comes apart for cleaning, and that&#x27;s fairly easy.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use</li>
            <li>The unit was shipped very quickly also</li>
            <li>The product will easily groom nose, ear, and eyebrow hair.</li>
            <li>It seems to have a strong motor.  </li>
            <li>I first bought this about 10 years ago, if you don&#x27;t have one of these you need it, it&#x27;s extremely handy and does the job</li>
            <li>works as stated easy to handle,it&#x27;s not cumbersum to handle the light</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t come with a battery, which is fine for the price.</li>
            <li>Works fine.  </li>
            <li>So I suggest purchasing more than one at a time or go with a higher priced more durable solution.</li>
            <li>Not super sturdy, but works wonderfully for the price.</li>
            <li>Service from Amazon was fine.</li>
            <li>- Technically true, as it will work, but most of these you will need to follow up with a razor for a smooth finish.  </li>
            <li>It will cut fine hair but not as close as would be desired.</li>
            <li>Seems to work fine.  </li>
            <li>For use on the side burn, eyelashes, and any body hair that are easily accessed, it is very useful and works fine.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I would recommend this product to anyone though, because I noticed that most people experience a lot of problems with this type of product, especially when it&#x27;s not working properly in good condition or when it&#x27;s becoming obsolete.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve this product for about a month works just fine the light works just fine</li>
            <li>Powerful safe and easy to use</li>
            <li>The trimmer works just fine, but with the light on[[ASIN:</li>
            <li>The light attached to the shaver never even worked.</li>
            <li>The light did not even work on it.  </li>
            <li>The trimmer works great, same as the one I had to replace.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Second there is supposed to be a light at the tip, but it does not work.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The light never worked.  </li>
            <li>like I said, the light never worked from day one.</li>
            <li>The light didn&#x27;t work from the start.  </li>
            <li>I bought it to keep in my travel bag for when I realize I have not tended to regular hair control,  and it works great.</li>
            <li>Meant to shorten hair,  not make you wax level smooth.</li>
            <li>Switch is cheap.</li>
            <li>The light does not work.  </li>
            <li>I could feel that it was made on the cheap</li>
            <li>Cheap piece of junk.</li>
            <li>yet the light still worked.  </li>
            <li>This is truly a disgrace of a company, no matter how cheap they are.  </li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t even turn on just the light worked.</li>
            <li>The trimmer would be great for removing hair in your ear or nose, especially if it is a problem for you.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It does have a flimsy cheap feel - however i have 4 or 5 of these laying around (some for travel)</li>
            <li>I knew better, but thought it might be worth a try.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a light on the MicroTouch that that I keep off because it would otherwise shine in my eyes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, a fantastic set.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll say this for Idea Village: they know that if you&#x27;re going to sell cheap stuff, you need to sell it cheap.  </li>
            <li>: I was sent a free product sample for review.</li>
            <li>LIGHT DOES NOT WORK AT ALL.  .</li>
            <li>just really cheaply made.</li>
            <li>but the light doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>Without a light you cannot see what you&#x27;re doing.</li>
            <li>The unit is suppose to have a light but the light does not work.</li>
            <li>Light never worked, product falls apart around the blade area.</li>
            <li>I will admit that having the light in the Micro Touch was something I was looking forward to</li>
            <li>and now there is a light</li>
            <li>As of this writing the price is six bucks with free shipping, meaning that it&#x27;s cheap.  </li>
            <li>As of this writing the price is six bucks with free shipping, meaning that it&#x27;s cheap.  </li>
            <li>Feels like a cheap toy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Cheap design.</li>
            <li>if they really know what there own warranty states.</li>
            <li>Light did not work.</li>
            <li>Well i bought this not expecting a great deal since i had read a series of mixed reviews.</li>
            <li>When turned on, the motor ran at varying speeds and the light flickered.  </li>
            <li>As a female, I find it works great for shaping and trimming my eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>It also comes with a light on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works well but feels cheap</li>
            <li>It rattles and the light goes off and on while trying to cut.  </li>
            <li>He like the fact of the light incorporatedvto it.</li>
            <li>However the Micro Touch Max, albeit a cheaply made product, does trim hair.</li>
            <li>I received this Micro Touch Max as a free sample.  </li>
            <li>The Light on it Does Not work and rather than cut hair</li>
            <li>Feels cheap.  </li>
            <li>The light does not work.</li>
            <li>When I used it the light wouldn&#x27;t stay on.</li>
            <li>I got sucked into the so called deluxe model which I cannot locate on any web site including their own for $24.98 plus I was charged $17.97 shipping for a total of $42.95.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does an excellent job for the front nose hair, and hair on my ear lobes, but it does not work very well on the hair that are inside my nose towards the back of the nose.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Very disapointed!!!</li>
            <li>My Micro Touch Max Hair Remover arrived with a very nice zippered storage case and several accessories.</li>
            <li>For a man, I could see how the Micro Touch Max would be very useful for mustaches as well as eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>It is quick and easy to use for unwanted hairs.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t believe I can return it because I thru the original packing away.  </li>
            <li>I was pleased with the micro touch hair remover for the first 4 weeks.</li>
            <li>a great job in trimming hair and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>Had the old model before and liked it, but the improved model is far superior.  </li>
            <li>It works better if you use electric clippers first.</li>
            <li>this trimmer is a redesign of the original 5 to 7 years ago, it doesn&#x27;t perform well in fact its a piece</li>
            <li>did not have this problem with the original Micro Touch hair</li>
            <li>Happy with product but took a long time to arrive.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a $10 crappy gadget that makes someone else rich and &amp;#34;nickles out&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>The eyebrows are pretty ok, unless you&#x27;re trying to take them clean off.  </li>
            <li>I use them to clean up my husbands neck after a hair cut, side burns, etc.</li>
            <li>* cleaning brush (to clean the MicroTouch)&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its a great product but for a limited time.</li>
            <li>i bought it because i saw many positive comments but after all i learned the lesson WE CANNOT BUY ALL WHAT WE SEE..</li>
            <li>Other wise it was ok .</li>
            <li>Hair trimmer has no power to do what the add for it says ,very dissatisfied tried better batteries</li>
            <li>Would I try to shave all of my pubic area,  or a full beard,  no,  </li>
            <li>I am attempting to determine how I can get a full refund</li>
            <li>, I would consider this a really good gift for dad, son, or any male in your life you would like to keep well</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work, it&#x27;s cheap and it&#x27;s not even worth it</li>
            <li>You could do better with scissors or a real trimmer.</li>
            <li>os junk, they should have left a good thing alone</li>
            <li>So far it seems more powerful and better made than the Remingtons.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall this is a good facial hair trimmer for the price.  </li>
            <li>If it was a straight tip it would make it more convenient for me</li>
            <li>The LED light is marginally useful as well.</li>
            <li>It appeared to me the trimmer would have a good application in my personal grooming.  </li>
            <li>For what it is and the price I guess it works good enough.</li>
            <li>Has a light, which can be useful.</li>
            <li>It definitely should not be sold through Amazon, A Place I respect for having good quality items..</li>
            <li>Good for simple grooming.</li>
            <li>It is good if you aren&#x27;t prone to a lot of facial hair.  </li>
            <li>Not bad for the price.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and very gentle -</li>
            <li>Even bought new name brand batteries and neither worked - at all not one iota of power - don&#x27;t buy this - get another brand that is easily found in any drug or dept store!</li>
            <li>quick neck, sideburns and even eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>\\&quot;Super</li>
            <li>I tried lot of trimmers and others hair remover,this is by far the most accurate and the easiest to handle.</li>
            <li>Spend a couple more dollars and get a better product from a local box store.</li>
            <li>My husband likes it too quick and doesn&#x27;t pull on your hair.</li>
            <li>It is very useful for trimming and shaping the haircut on the back of his neck, since he cuts his own hair.</li>
            <li>First and foremost the light on it does not work.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re better off using your normal Beard Trimmer.</li>
            <li>First the light went out.</li>
            <li>As mentioned by others - this trimmer works faster and more effectively than any other I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>Not near as good of a tool as advertised.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t see better products, so I&#x27;ll live with it.</li>
            <li>So be aware with what you&#x27;re getting when looking at this, if youre looking for something you really want to have for a while and has a bit more oomph to it do look elsewhere.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure it would work as advertised but very surprised it did.</li>
            <li>To conclude on a positive note, it is cheap and it does trim.</li>
            <li>I should have bought that one in the first place!  </li>
            <li>I have a good Panasonic ear and nose hair trimmer which works well, but it has a conical top which hides the blades, so it&#x27;s not very good at stray eyebrow hairs or the edge of an ear.</li>
            <li>whole family want one...reasonable price even has a light.</li>
            <li>Given the cost, it wasn&#x27;t worth my time to go through the hassel of returning it.    </li>
            <li>It seems ok, so far after 1 use.</li>
            <li>For the price it is a solid  performer for any road warriors that want the audience&#x27;s  rapt attention,  and not because your nose hair is dancing to it own tune.</li>
            <li>Put in a fresh battery, cleaned the terminals, etc.  </li>
            <li>The trimmer doesn&#x27;t seem overly powerful.</li>
            <li>product was effective enough when it worked.</li>
            <li>I bought this item as a gift to a friend who jokingly said he wanted one, so I for a laugh or two bought this item</li>
            <li>As seen on TV isn&#x27;t worth the money.</li>
            <li>The trimmer came with two batteries, however I was only able to fit in one.</li>
            <li>In use was only marginally effective, did not cut close.</li>
            <li>twice as powerful os</li>
            <li>I purchased this as I was looking for a detail trimmer for sideburns and eyebrows, and the adverts suggest that this is quite a powerful unit.</li>
            <li>and so far it is ok.  </li>
            <li>But then I think he will be useful to my yerno.</li>
            <li>The Micro touch max is awsome - nice and quiet</li>
            <li>The micro touch is not as powerful as was advertised.</li>
            <li>Also, the battery dies pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>There are several nice features, and it trimmed pretty effectively, BUT it broke after the second time I used it.  </li>
            <li>Good luck on anything other than a prepubescent&#x27;s peach fuzz.  </li>
            <li>wasn&#x27;t exactly what I expected, Bought it for my husband and he said it was ok for all but the nose,tickled to the point of not being able to use it .</li>
            <li>I had problems with this right out of the box.  </li>
            <li>a glowing review, right?</li>
            <li>Tried it and it broke right away, I could not even trim a bit on my face.</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>but even if you do have a larger trimmer, this can still come in handy for situations and areas where a larger &amp; more powerful trimmer won&#x27;t work as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it broke on the very first use and upon inspection I determined that it was not mad very well at all</li>
            <li>Purchased 2 of these trimmers and both have on / off switches that are very tempermental, you have to play with it in order for the motor to run at full speed.</li>
            <li>Great stocking stuffer or small gift.</li>
            <li>Small compact size makes it great for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly suprised that there was no pain, so I moved around a little.  </li>
            <li>You can get about 3 good uses out of it before it starts to break down.</li>
            <li>that use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer features an LED light, great for tough to see areas.  </li>
            <li>After around 3 weeks the light stopped working even with a new battery.</li>
            <li>Pure junk!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s under powered and jams easily making it necessary to dismantle and clean throughly each time you use it.</li>
            <li>Does not work half as good as they make it look.</li>
            <li>threw it in the trash as it would cost more to send it back then its worth.</li>
            <li>The product is very very cheap and the switch is fragile.  </li>
            <li>Second it is very cheaply made.</li>
            <li>So, if you need those pesky little hairs trimmed and don&#x27;t mind throwing the dice that you&#x27;ll get a good unit, give this a try.</li>
            <li>The price is right, the shipping was super and the product works better than expected.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s about time someone came up with a hair remover that really works!  </li>
            <li>First it is battery powered (AAA)</li>
            <li>First, it wouldn&#x27;t come on then once I got it turned on</li>
            <li>First one did not work company replaced with no problum.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m pretty bummed out.</li>
            <li>The light works well so far</li>
            <li>I would like to review this product ,but unfortunately never received it .</li>
            <li>subsequently bought a much better one here on Amazon manufactured by ToiletTree Products.  </li>
            <li>I had to pass by about ten times each brow for it to get the results I was satisfied with.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it for 4 minutes for my nose hairs</li>
            <li>For these uses I found the trimmer to perform really well; did a nice job keeping an even line and removing only as much hair as I aimed it to do.  </li>
            <li>I ended up wasting money on my first trimmer even though it was pretty inexpensive.</li>
            <li>This second trimmer is still okay though.</li>
            <li>we consumers buy these days, what with so many being made outside the USA.</li>
            <li>It worked the first time I turned it on then wouldn&#x27;t come on.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t save packaging or would have returned it, do like it when it works though - thanks anyway!</li>
            <li>First of all, the picture shows this product in the package.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had two of these and both quit working after the first time.</li>
            <li>I was quite surprised to find out that his hair trimmer has a built in light which I didn&#x27;t even notice in the infomercial.</li>
            <li>At first I thought it was the batteries.</li>
            <li>Item arrived early, light on shaver has not functioned from the start.  </li>
            <li>Just thought the product was promoted better than it actually is.</li>
            <li>:), and it works well, for various parts of my head.</li>
            <li>It insured them that I most likely would not return it as I would give up the $17.97 they charged to receive it</li>
            <li>I bought this as I have short hair and wanted to be able to get my neck.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve consistently tried to get it to work</li>
            <li>This can&#x27;t be the first time this has happen to a Micro Touch Max Hair Remover.</li>
            <li>First of all it hurts my nostrils.  </li>
            <li>This does exactly what it says.  </li>
            <li>I bought this as a cheap, quick way to remove facial hair and sideburns.</li>
            <li>It lacks power overall but the longer blade and shape of the trimmer are a plus its good for the above mentioned uses.</li>
            <li>Very seldom does one of mine last more than a month or two.  </li>
            <li>The extra attachments it comes with are good for different areas for hair removal.  </li>
            <li>It is not robustly designed and its very flimsy—did not like this one bit—Philips similar style could have been a better option.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately as I have had it for some time now, the best quality pieces in the whole system are the nail clippers.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it for side burns, the on off button is a bit awkward not as easy as the earlier version was better, but in the end I still use the product and am happy with the price and quality of the product</li>
            <li>So far the only extra accessory used was the lint brush which works great.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to groom really well!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Setup of this product was easy - simply insert the included battery, close it up, and turn it on</li>
            <li>It certainly does what you say it does.</li>
            <li>or if you have large areas of hair that need trimming...</li>
            <li>The blade is fairly large and you would not recommend it for nose or ears.&lt;br</li>
            <li>PURE JUNK.</li>
            <li>Again, it&#x27;s a good product, but doesn&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
            <li>nice little gadget which lasted about 2 uses before breaking.</li>
            <li>nifty little travel case that came with my sample is worth much more than the trimmer</li>
            <li>Using duracell AAA battery cheap waste of money.and did not get a free battery w/mine,uses 1battery.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really know, it came broke.</li>
            <li>The 2nd one trims, but the light doesnt work..</li>
            <li>Thanks for nothing.</li>
            <li>This is a real piece of junk.</li>
            <li>Does some of the things as advertised but doesn&#x27;t trim between nose and mustache very well.  </li>
            <li>And the battery really will not pull the razor.</li>
            <li>Now, ONLY the light works.</li>
            <li>B003ZW9LOQ Micro Touch Max Hair Remover]], batteries burn out too fast.</li>
            <li>I probably wasn&#x27;t expecting much with this shaver.</li>
            <li>I bought this for  $3, I wasn&#x27;t expecting much.</li>
            <li>very neat.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Product - not so much.</li>
            <li>Very unreliable.</li>
            <li>It really helps me see how well a job it is doing--or</li>
            <li>what we wanted and very pleased!&lt;br /&gt;THANK</li>
            <li>My husband used it to trim his neck and sideburns and it worked well, but it did not do much for his arm hairs which he likes to keep shaved because he is a mechanic</li>
            <li>Only 4 stars because the led light didn&#x27;t work on mine.  </li>
            <li>It cut hair very well for me.</li>
            <li>If you have, then you have probably wondered just how well those products really work.  </li>
            <li>As of this writing, the product page is very sparse on details.  </li>
            <li>After anticipating its arrival and talking about it so much, it never gets used</li>
            <li>and it really dosnt work like the commercials</li>
            <li>After ready the reviews,</li>
            <li>I ordered this product based on an infomercial and really feel taken.</li>
            <li>Having received it today, I realize why they ripped me for so much of a shipping charge.</li>
            <li>Shipped fast.</li>
            <li>and you are ready to go.  </li>
            <li>You really get what you pay for--</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t really push it in.  </li>
            <li>Neither of them really worked all that well.</li>
            <li>I only kept it because I remembered I got it cheap at CVS (I think)</li>
            <li>(but, I wasn&#x27;t really looking.)</li>
            <li>I purchased this micro touch and it worked really well for six months.  </li>
            <li>It needs to be returned but the only reason I didn&#x27;t is because it was so cheap</li>
            <li>so you buy another oppurtunity in to see your offer thanks</li>
            <li>I bought this to help with my husbands neck area and it does not work very well.  </li>
            <li>Broke after 1st use very disapointed will never buy again</li>
            <li>Also it doesn&#x27;t cut hair very well, but loves to cut into flesh....</li>
            <li>they offer the free additional items because they may be worth the money spent on this item.  </li>
            <li>First off no battery; Then when new AAA battery was inserted it continued to fall out.  </li>
            <li>Purchased Microtouch Max at a local Walgreens and excitedly  </li>
            <li>point to bear in mind is that for the length of time that the MicroTouch works, it works extremely well, shaving hair closely but safely.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s better for other parts of the body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Much better than the other brands</li>
            <li>Junk.. Bring back the original..</li>
            <li>And while this would be a total ripoff at its SRP of 30 bucks, it is now 6 and change here, and that is exactly what I think it&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>Over on the product&#x27;s web site, IdeaVillage more actively advertises the wonder of the Micro Touch Max.  </li>
            <li>Have tried several in the past, but have heard great reviews on this one.</li>
            <li>It works as advertised, but after one successful use I had trouble trying to use it a second time.  </li>
            <li>My old trimmer works just as good if not better.</li>
            <li>The accessories look nice, but I don&#x27;t expect them to last long.</li>
            <li>i purchased this item for my husband for christmas, it worked, barely, the first time and has now died!</li>
            <li>only thing true on add is you won&#x27;t cut yourself ?</li>
            <li>and it is not worth more than the shipping charge.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with the seller&#x27;s handling of my order, however, the quality of the product is somewhat less than I had hoped for.</li>
            <li>I previously purchased one of these by Panasonic years ago and love it.  </li>
            <li>While this product does work after a fashion it definitely is not as fast and easy as they say.</li>
            <li>They must know it is junk and are trying to sell as many as possible, as quickly as possible.</li>
            <li>It does a decent job of trimming--the main purpose of this unit.    </li>
            <li>It is not what the older ones used to be.</li>
            <li>I chose this over a phillips trimmer mainly cus of the price</li>
            <li>and then it started running steady then would stop.  </li>
            <li>I bought it mainly to trim my nose hairs and the hair on my neck.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to others.</li>
            <li>Not a quality product, but should not have high expectations for $10.  </li>
            <li>its a decent little unit, works ok.</li>
            <li>The whole feel of this thing is light and flimsy feeling, and a piece of the trimmer end has already broke, even though I was very careful with it.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, the build seems a little better than others have indicated.</li>
            <li>Which is where this little thing excels; because the tiny blades are exposed, you can cut within millimeters of where you want it, so it&#x27;s great for eyebrows and ear hair, the only thing I need it for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is ideal for cutting your pesky pubic hair.</li>
            <li>Having tried what was supposed to be a better-quality trimmer made by Norelco, and found that it didn&#x27;t cut hair nearly as well as the MicroTouch, I made another purchase of the latter (my third in the last 6 years) and am very glad that I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many</li>
            <li>But if it does, then you&#x27;re getting a service well worth six bucks, especially if you have unruly hairs declaring war on your ears and</li>
            <li>I bought this product thinking it was as powerful as regular clippers</li>
            <li>Not even worth it to mail it back</li>
            <li>This product did not meet my expectation at all, it is not practical, it is only a toy rather than a useful tool.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Of course, why not just use a normal razor then?  </li>
            <li>But, when you consider what you get for the current price of about $6, it is definitely worth buying if you have the need.  </li>
            <li>I even put in fresh batteries, but the results were the same.</li>
            <li>Motor not as strong as more expensive brands.</li>
            <li>I was right, it definitely has a place.  </li>
            <li>The switch mechanism sloppy with a fair amount of play that contributes to the motor sounding funky.  </li>
            <li>The switch mechanism sloppy with a fair amount of play that contributes to the motor sounding funky.  </li>
            <li>I could have purchased it from Amazon or other site for $9.50 and in some cases free shipping as I found out after receiving the Micro Touch Max.</li>
            <li>even tried new batteries.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I tried new battery and even tested the battery streangh with a volt meter.  </li>
            <li>I can agree when people say that even with a new battery this device doesnt pack a punch.  </li>
            <li>Well, you live and you learn.</li>
            <li>Looking for something new I came upon this.  </li>
            <li>The Micro Touch has found it&#x27;s new home in the bottom of my tool box to be used maybe as a door stop.</li>
            <li>Plus the product came in bubble wrap so can&#x27;t even tell if it&#x27;s new.</li>
            <li>I tried 2 sets of brand new batteries...no improvement.  </li>
            <li>This new model I&#x27;ve been just throwing into the drawer after use</li>
            <li>/&gt;Third, product was so cheap it wasn&#x27;t worth the effort to return, or file a complaint.</li>
            <li>It is cheaply made, which is why I would recommend something more expensive if you will be using it a lot</li>
            <li>I recently replaced mine with the Philips Norelco, which is far superior, and only slightly more expensive than the MicroTouch.</li>
            <li>The major downside is the build quality but for the price I can&#x27;t complain much.</li>
            <li>First off I only it use for nose hairs and eyebrows.</li>
            <li>Exactly like the one sold on TV, only 1/3 the cost.</li>
            <li>In my experience, the same cannot be said for the Norelco NT9110 (the model that I tried and abandoned after one use); and from what I&#x27;ve read, none of the other devices in this category perform any, if at all, better.</li>
            <li>But it is not expensive either, and it comes with a \\&quot;free\\&quot; personal care zippered case loaded with all kinds of goodies:  Clippers, comb, file, toothbrush, tweezers, lint remover and shoe</li>
            <li>This is different than the first one.</li>
            <li>wow!</li>
            <li>The shoehorn is small and may work better as a tongue</li>
            <li>The only thing that is not plastic are the nail trimmers and tweezers and the tweezers are pretty worthless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only way I could use it was as a trimmer after I used scissors, which defeats the purpose in the first place.  </li>
            <li>Cheap, barely works, loose connections in battery compartment</li>
            <li>It boggs down even on something light like the hair on your arm.</li>
            <li>One of them had a non-working light right out of the package, but hey, who needs a light on a hair cutting tool?</li>
            <li>I ordered this product to replace a previous one of same name and design that I physically bought at a retail store that worked great for a long time and just got worn out.</li>
            <li>It will also trim small amounts of hair near the top of your ears in between cuts and can trim your eyebrows.</li>
            <li>I owned a similar, but less &amp;#34;fancy&amp;#34; model of a personal grooming tool and this new one is much nicer and works better.</li>
            <li>Line up the two dots and things will fit tightly.  </li>
            <li>However, I would not recommend this product for removing large amounts of hairs, such as chest or leg hair.  </li>
            <li>controller seems a little cheaply made.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product with the intention of using it once or twice till it broke; apparently my expectations were to high.</li>
            <li>this little charmer does an outstanding job but don&#x27;t expect it to last forever.</li>
            <li>It kind of works, but it&#x27;s very weak and too much hair will make it turn off.</li>
            <li>Secondly, it doesn&#x27;t do a very good job of cutting.  </li>
            <li>Then after six uses it died completely.</li>
            <li>The light went out literally a few seconds after I turned it on.</li>
            <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME &amp; MONEY.</li>
            <li>wow save your money</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised it&#x27;s not at all listed in the description.&lt;br</li>
            <li>OLD ONE</li>
            <li>cheap broke after a few times i used it..</li>
            <li>As far as the hair remover part it works as advertised.</li>
            <li>When physically comparing the two  this version is much cheaper</li>
            <li>It even lets you change a battery whaich the old model did not.</li>
            <li>Local lighting is very helpful too.</li>
            <li>I did not realize what was contained in the so called Delux Grooming Kit but the contents I already have, so it was a wasted add-on for Free but with $6.99 shipping</li>
            <li>If you expect to do a complete haircut and sideburns trim</li>
            <li>The light did not work out of the box and it seems like it always takes a few seconds for it to get up to speed.</li>
            <li>Light works but motor is dead.  </li>
            <li>It also does cause a pinch on your skin in sensitive areas.</li>
            <li>and I think it works very well as a facial hair trimmer.  </li>
            <li>This is really meant for smaller areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I only really bought it to use with the adapters</li>
            <li>The real kicker, and the reason for the one star, is that neither tool cut hair close enough to make a difference.</li>
            <li>But even if it were solid with a quality feel, I really couldn&#x27;t recommend it anyway.  </li>
            <li>When they do run fast enough they work well.</li>
            <li>Really, it doesn&#x27;t seem to make sense to do so as the blades of the Micro Touch Max are at the wrong angle for that kind of work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, if you need something more heavy duty or for larger areas, you are going to want to look elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample</li>
            <li>If it starts working annoyingly slowly, just be sure to try replacing the batteries.</li>
            <li>It took a few tries, but the Micro Touch effectively shaved that area.&lt;br /&gt;Both</li>
            <li>It trimmed one brow fine, but the other was left with a patch that looked like singed hairs.</li>
            <li>in all, if the product was £3 it would be about the right price, and only for very occasional use.</li>
            <li>For a mustache, you have to scrape it across your upper lip a couple hundred time just to get MOST of the hair off and for sideburns, it just plain doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>The unit is severely underpowered - which is especially a problem with hair trimming as it will have the tendency to drag hairs rather than giving a clean cut.</li>
            <li>The only issue I had with it was that the battery that came with was dead and that was an easy fix.</li>
            <li>I first got it, I gingerly inserted it into a nostril and carefully turned it on.  </li>
            <li>Ive used it around 3 times, seems to hold up so far despite other rating I see that say it broke after the first time or never worked.</li>
            <li>amazon good enough to take it back, but really poor quality item.</li>
            <li>Is it a solid little unit for light duty trimming nose,  ear,  and misc body hair,  yes.</li>
            <li>Expected a little better shaver.</li>
            <li>- There is a light, it does work, but the location of it is such that little to no illumination gets to the work</li>
            <li>I put a brand new battery in it and tried it out on the hair on back of my neck.  </li>
            <li>Finally, the blade holder would not stay shut, so I decided it was time for a new nose/ear trimmer.</li>
            <li>Battery went dead quick...</li>
            <li>My first trimmer would work once I had it on the &amp;#34;ON&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Light&amp;#34; setting, but the blade cutters wouldn&#x27;t cut pieces of my hairs properly whenever I would put the trimmer directly on my facial and bodily hairs.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and small enough to take as a travel item.</li>
            <li>Based on the price and quality it is not worth more than half a star</li>
            <li>badly constructed, flimsy, falling apart, the original was a much better product, almost junk 6 dmore words required eenough aleady</li>
            <li>No, his hair was either too thick or too fine,</li>
            <li>So I bought it and the dang thing is cheap hard plastic.  </li>
            <li>It lasted MAYBE 30 seconds, and the motor stopped working, but at least the light continued to work</li>
            <li>It was whole one second and in a bunch of pieces the next second.  </li>
            <li>It barely trims anything.</li>
            <li>Im surprised that Amazon would allow such junk to be sold from their site.</li>
            <li>Basically a piece of junk that when you can get it to turn on it barely trims any hair at all.</li>
            <li>it does cut you if you are not careful.</li>
            <li>Razors only cut this sensitive area.</li>
            <li>The thing barely runs.  </li>
            <li>On the minus side, it is barely capable of trimming any hair at all.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>Apparently, this doesn&#x27;t matter.</li>
            <li>and they barely run.</li>
            <li>Takes me 2-3 times as long to trim my face then it does with my normal rechargeable shaver.</li>
            <li>Even with a fresh battery in it, (and it only takes one), this thing slows down and stalls even in use with the lightest hair.  </li>
            <li>I only really use this the odd stray eyebrow hair, which it manages (but surely that is the least you would expect from this product).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Trimmers are usually not the best products, but this thing is the worst I have ever seen.</li>
            <li>This particular model is intended to be used occasionally because it is made out of plastic parts and will not survive constant daily use.</li>
            <li>Mine lasted for a couple months, then unexpectedly the light stopped working even when i would change the batteries, and the shaver would be really weak depending on how i tilted it.</li>
            <li>Sipping was much faster than I expected, so that was a big plus.</li>
            <li>So, why should anyone be surprised that a device costing only $10 would last any longer?&#x27;&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would classify it as somewhat fragile in that I really doubt it would survive a fall onto bathroom tile, so I would treat it carefully.  </li>
            <li>and I have to shake the trimmer a little to get it to run higher.</li>
            <li>But once I fiddle with it a bit, it works fine, and the blades work well, cutting small hairs fast and cleanly.</li>
            <li>I have had 2 other ones from the same company and they were much sharper and stronger.</li>
            <li>This was my second time ordering the same trimmer, because the other one that I ordered the first time and received didn&#x27;t work properly.</li>
            <li>and it barely even trimmed any of his facial hair.  </li>
            <li>Within the first few uses the power would seem to \\&quot;surge\\&quot; on the device.  </li>
            <li>Then the blades quickly became dull and started to pull hair instead of cut.</li>
            <li>Afterwards we noticed that the amount charged was more then expected turns out despite her having clicked the razor only they had added the stupid grooming kit on top charging us the S&amp;H for that.  </li>
            <li>I then ordered a Micro Touch Max Trimmer for the second time and didn&#x27;t have as much trouble than the first one.</li>
            <li>First of all, it is not very effective as nasal hair trimmer.  </li>
            <li>Works okay on ordinary basis, but not very well with different applications, and unfortunately one function (light) does´nt work on both items bought</li>
            <li>I had a similar product that lasted for 6 years, until it got a little wet, and then it started acting up, but this one seems to be a little better protected against moisture.  </li>
            <li>A cheep piece of junk not worth any where near the price, if they sold it for a dime it would be over priced!!</li>
            <li>I was watching this commercial and saw the tiny little thing falling apart and googled to see who really bought this and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not going to throw good money after bad.</li>

            <li> and it looked good</li>
            <li> Some people say they replace this every three to five years, making it a good bargain.</li>
            <li> The seller did a good job getting the item to me though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also discovered that on spots where there&#x27;s a good patch of hair it will jam up and stop working.  </li>
            <li> Item does a fair job of removing hair.  </li>
            <li> Good product for grooming tasks</li>

            <li> when it worked, it did a fair job.</li>
            <li> Good stuff...</li>
            <li> I thought this would be a good trimmer for vacations, but I tried it and with a days growth on my face, it would not cut it.</li>
            <li> Works good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product</li>

            <li> Thanks for a very great product.</li>
            <li> Not as effective as a nose hair trimmer as hoped.  </li>
            <li> Conceptually it&#x27;s a nice idea, but the quality isn&#x27;t there, so I would avoid this product.</li>
            <li> Women, this is a nice gift to give your man.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to keep one in each bathroom and a couple in travel kits.</li>
            <li> Had one before and liked it.&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li> I received this Micro Touch Max trimmer in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li> Nice product.</li>
            <li> I own Panasonic Pivoting Head trimmer which I use to sculpt my \\&quot;sideburns\\&quot; in between hair appointments.</li>
            <li> Kind Regards,   Citlaly   </li>
            <li> I liked the product when it worked</li>
            <li> Was nicely packaged as well.</li>
            <li> and I doubt there is anything deluxe about the one I received which is supose to be</li>
            <li> It kind of works if you don&#x27;t use any of the adapters.  </li>
            <li> Now he has he own and loves it.  </li>
            <li> The product is good and if it wasn&#x27;t for the battery being gone out of the package I would have given it a better review.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great and useful for us to do good by</li>
            <li> best product I have found on  the market thus far...works great, get into those hard to reach places and the service was great.</li>
            <li> Worked fine, great idea but the quality of the product needs to be better.</li>
            <li> sure could have made this better, but for six bucks it&#x27;s a fair deal.</li>
            <li> perfectly fine and good.</li>
            <li> product arrived on time and are very good, a responsible person is recommended.</li>
            <li> but what good is it to have the light shine on hair that isn&#x27;t being removed-</li>
            <li> bright light lets you see what you&#x27;re doing.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> even though it is a controversial rating, I&#x27;m giving these four stars because the price matches the quality and they do work.</li>
            <li> Worked great when I first received.</li>
            <li> This item is very cheap.  </li>
            <li> The quality of the trimmer itself is very cheap.</li>
            <li> product is very cheaply made and does not work well.</li>
            <li> Would not cut hairs, was very cheap and broke after about 3 minutes of use.</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made.  </li>
            <li> very cheaply put</li>
            <li> I always try to give an honest and fair review stating positive and negatives.</li>
            <li> Much better than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> and this one works better.</li>
            <li> with no guarantee that the replacement will be any better.</li>
            <li> That said, it&#x27;s better than others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> sure helps when doing the ears,worth the money.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t complain really because it works great</li>
            <li> I would have gladly paid more for a better product.</li>
            <li> I bought this solely for trimming my eyebrows, which is probably the most it could handle anyways.</li>
            <li> I turned it off and was pleased.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had cheaper that was better made.</li>
            <li> About the equivalent length of time, at most?</li>
            <li> It did struggle with more course hair like the neck and side burns.</li>
            <li> I have found it to perform really well, and be a great maintenance tool.  </li>
            <li> Enjoy!</li>
            <li> /&gt;After using the Micro Touch, the family members decided it was OK and rated it at 3 stars.</li>
            <li> kit comes with so much more.</li>
            <li> They are ultra-cheap tweezers that don&#x27;t work any better than if I used my fingernails.&lt;br</li>
            <li> love the light!  </li>
            <li> Maybe it just need better directions, but I don&#x27;t get it...</li>
            <li> I HAVE WAS BETTER....</li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s the way it is with many products</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather spend more money and buy a better one</li>
            <li> Cuts ok</li>
            <li> Better off looking at a Norelco and/or a Wahl....</li>
            <li> and we all had a good laugh about it</li>
            <li> That said, it is not as \\&quot;safe to the touch\\&quot; as the ads claim.</li>
            <li> , yes it&#x27;s safe to touch.\\&quot;  -</li>
            <li> Panasonic trimmer allows me to make them as cute looking as my hairdresser.</li>
            <li> and it really works great.</li>
            <li> The power, what there is comes and goes, but it is mostly gone.  </li>
            <li> plus I would have to pay the return shipping which I doubt would be more than $6.</li>
            <li> Most nose hair trimmers have a removable head which can be washed; this doesn&#x27;t and is unsanitary because it cannot be washed.</li>
            <li> In truth I thought was bringing more accessories.</li>
            <li> So I tried it again, this time more vigorously.  </li>
            <li> My husband is gonna love this gift.  </li>
            <li> If I were in the market for a trimmer, I would pass this by and look for something with more quality.</li>
            <li> Micro Touch itself works OK.  </li>
            <li> Sure they could have made the build quality along the lines of the  [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> but it works ok.</li>
            <li> But, there are much better products out there.</li>
            <li> Although this trimmer has some nice attachments and features, its just too damn cheap.</li>
            <li> Works OK.</li>
            <li> nothing more don&#x27;t trust</li>
            <li> Have bought 2 of these and neither one lasted more than a week.</li>
            <li> Nice but cheap shaver.</li>
            <li> It came in a pouch with some very nice finger and toe nail clippers, some attachments, and a carrying case for the whole system.  </li>
            <li> I cut my own hair and had problems maintaining a clean look around my ears..</li>
            <li> I loved doing my eyebrows for the first time in my life by myself!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll</li>
            <li> The Micro Touch Max Trimmer seems to work pretty good.</li>
            <li> And if it works, it&#x27;s actually a pretty good deal.</li>
            <li> At first it looks like a good product.  </li>
            <li> Pretty good for the money.</li>
            <li> Clearing a hairy area in a dry mode is probably the best use of it.</li>
            <li> The LED light is nice, but doesn&#x27;t light up the correct</li>
            <li> Works ok, but light did not work and could perform better</li>
            <li> This is very true for this product.</li>
            <li> Well, safe to touch is accurate.  </li>
            <li> i had used the old micro touch trimmer for years and it was great.  </li>
            <li> I used finishing touch prior which I liked mostly lasted a good 3 years.  </li>
            <li> I use this for trimming nose hair (primarily) and i find it does a better job than the rotary nose hair clippers.&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li> In a way that&#x27;s fitting, because the Micro Touch Max is cheaply made.  </li>
            <li> In a way that&#x27;s fitting, because the Micro Touch Max is cheaply made.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s capable of taking off a good amount of hair.</li>
            <li> This one works like a charm - powerful motor, excellent blades, solid construction.</li>
            <li> Overall, for $3, I&#x27;m happy that it does something, but I wouldn&#x27;t pay $1 more.</li>
            <li> The unit comes apart for cleaning, and that&#x27;s fairly easy.  </li>
            <li> The unit comes apart for cleaning, and that&#x27;s fairly easy.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use</li>
            <li> The unit was shipped very quickly also</li>
            <li> The product will easily groom nose, ear, and eyebrow hair.</li>
            <li> It seems to have a strong motor.  </li>
            <li> I first bought this about 10 years ago, if you don&#x27;t have one of these you need it, it&#x27;s extremely handy and does the job</li>
            <li> works as stated easy to handle,it&#x27;s not cumbersum to handle the light</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t come with a battery, which is fine for the price.</li>
            <li> Works fine.  </li>
            <li> So I suggest purchasing more than one at a time or go with a higher priced more durable solution.</li>
            <li> Not super sturdy, but works wonderfully for the price.</li>
            <li> Service from Amazon was fine.</li>
            <li> - Technically true, as it will work, but most of these you will need to follow up with a razor for a smooth finish.  </li>
            <li> It will cut fine hair but not as close as would be desired.</li>
            <li> Seems to work fine.  </li>
            <li> For use on the side burn, eyelashes, and any body hair that are easily accessed, it is very useful and works fine.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I would recommend this product to anyone though, because I noticed that most people experience a lot of problems with this type of product, especially when it&#x27;s not working properly in good condition or when it&#x27;s becoming obsolete.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve this product for about a month works just fine the light works just fine</li>
            <li> Powerful safe and easy to use</li>
            <li> The trimmer works just fine, but with the light on[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> The light attached to the shaver never even worked.</li>
            <li> The light did not even work on it.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer works great, same as the one I had to replace.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Second there is supposed to be a light at the tip, but it does not work.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The light never worked.  </li>
            <li> like I said, the light never worked from day one.</li>
            <li> The light didn&#x27;t work from the start.  </li>
            <li> I bought it to keep in my travel bag for when I realize I have not tended to regular hair control,  and it works great.</li>
            <li> Meant to shorten hair,  not make you wax level smooth.</li>
            <li> Switch is cheap.</li>
            <li> The light does not work.  </li>
            <li> I could feel that it was made on the cheap</li>
            <li> Cheap piece of junk.</li>
            <li> yet the light still worked.  </li>
            <li> This is truly a disgrace of a company, no matter how cheap they are.  </li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t even turn on just the light worked.</li>
            <li> The trimmer would be great for removing hair in your ear or nose, especially if it is a problem for you.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It does have a flimsy cheap feel - however i have 4 or 5 of these laying around (some for travel)</li>
            <li> I knew better, but thought it might be worth a try.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a light on the MicroTouch that that I keep off because it would otherwise shine in my eyes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, a fantastic set.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll say this for Idea Village: they know that if you&#x27;re going to sell cheap stuff, you need to sell it cheap.  </li>
            <li> : I was sent a free product sample for review.</li>
            <li> LIGHT DOES NOT WORK AT ALL.  .</li>
            <li> just really cheaply made.</li>
            <li> but the light doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Without a light you cannot see what you&#x27;re doing.</li>
            <li> The unit is suppose to have a light but the light does not work.</li>
            <li> Light never worked, product falls apart around the blade area.</li>
            <li> I will admit that having the light in the Micro Touch was something I was looking forward to</li>
            <li> and now there is a light</li>
            <li> As of this writing the price is six bucks with free shipping, meaning that it&#x27;s cheap.  </li>
            <li> As of this writing the price is six bucks with free shipping, meaning that it&#x27;s cheap.  </li>
            <li> Feels like a cheap toy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Cheap design.</li>
            <li> if they really know what there own warranty states.</li>
            <li> Light did not work.</li>
            <li> Well i bought this not expecting a great deal since i had read a series of mixed reviews.</li>
            <li> When turned on, the motor ran at varying speeds and the light flickered.  </li>
            <li> As a female, I find it works great for shaping and trimming my eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> It also comes with a light on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works well but feels cheap</li>
            <li> It rattles and the light goes off and on while trying to cut.  </li>
            <li> He like the fact of the light incorporatedvto it.</li>
            <li> However the Micro Touch Max, albeit a cheaply made product, does trim hair.</li>
            <li> I received this Micro Touch Max as a free sample.  </li>
            <li> The Light on it Does Not work and rather than cut hair</li>
            <li> Feels cheap.  </li>
            <li> The light does not work.</li>
            <li> When I used it the light wouldn&#x27;t stay on.</li>
            <li> I got sucked into the so called deluxe model which I cannot locate on any web site including their own for $24.98 plus I was charged $17.97 shipping for a total of $42.95.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does an excellent job for the front nose hair, and hair on my ear lobes, but it does not work very well on the hair that are inside my nose towards the back of the nose.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Very disapointed!!!</li>
            <li> My Micro Touch Max Hair Remover arrived with a very nice zippered storage case and several accessories.</li>
            <li> For a man, I could see how the Micro Touch Max would be very useful for mustaches as well as eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> It is quick and easy to use for unwanted hairs.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe I can return it because I thru the original packing away.  </li>
            <li> I was pleased with the micro touch hair remover for the first 4 weeks.</li>
            <li> a great job in trimming hair and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Had the old model before and liked it, but the improved model is far superior.  </li>
            <li> It works better if you use electric clippers first.</li>
            <li> this trimmer is a redesign of the original 5 to 7 years ago, it doesn&#x27;t perform well in fact its a piece</li>
            <li> did not have this problem with the original Micro Touch hair</li>
            <li> Happy with product but took a long time to arrive.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a $10 crappy gadget that makes someone else rich and &amp;#34;nickles out&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> The eyebrows are pretty ok, unless you&#x27;re trying to take them clean off.  </li>
            <li> I use them to clean up my husbands neck after a hair cut, side burns, etc.</li>
            <li> * cleaning brush (to clean the MicroTouch)&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its a great product but for a limited time.</li>
            <li> i bought it because i saw many positive comments but after all i learned the lesson WE CANNOT BUY ALL WHAT WE SEE..</li>
            <li> Other wise it was ok .</li>
            <li> Hair trimmer has no power to do what the add for it says ,very dissatisfied tried better batteries</li>
            <li> Would I try to shave all of my pubic area,  or a full beard,  no,  </li>
            <li> I am attempting to determine how I can get a full refund</li>
            <li> , I would consider this a really good gift for dad, son, or any male in your life you would like to keep well</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work, it&#x27;s cheap and it&#x27;s not even worth it</li>
            <li> You could do better with scissors or a real trimmer.</li>
            <li> os junk, they should have left a good thing alone</li>
            <li> So far it seems more powerful and better made than the Remingtons.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall this is a good facial hair trimmer for the price.  </li>
            <li> If it was a straight tip it would make it more convenient for me</li>
            <li> The LED light is marginally useful as well.</li>
            <li> It appeared to me the trimmer would have a good application in my personal grooming.  </li>
            <li> For what it is and the price I guess it works good enough.</li>
            <li> Has a light, which can be useful.</li>
            <li> It definitely should not be sold through Amazon, A Place I respect for having good quality items..</li>
            <li> Good for simple grooming.</li>
            <li> It is good if you aren&#x27;t prone to a lot of facial hair.  </li>
            <li> Not bad for the price.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and very gentle -</li>
            <li> Even bought new name brand batteries and neither worked - at all not one iota of power - don&#x27;t buy this - get another brand that is easily found in any drug or dept store!</li>
            <li> quick neck, sideburns and even eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> \\&quot;Super</li>
            <li> I tried lot of trimmers and others hair remover,this is by far the most accurate and the easiest to handle.</li>
            <li> Spend a couple more dollars and get a better product from a local box store.</li>
            <li> My husband likes it too quick and doesn&#x27;t pull on your hair.</li>
            <li> It is very useful for trimming and shaping the haircut on the back of his neck, since he cuts his own hair.</li>
            <li> First and foremost the light on it does not work.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re better off using your normal Beard Trimmer.</li>
            <li> First the light went out.</li>
            <li> As mentioned by others - this trimmer works faster and more effectively than any other I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> Not near as good of a tool as advertised.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t see better products, so I&#x27;ll live with it.</li>
            <li> So be aware with what you&#x27;re getting when looking at this, if youre looking for something you really want to have for a while and has a bit more oomph to it do look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure it would work as advertised but very surprised it did.</li>
            <li> To conclude on a positive note, it is cheap and it does trim.</li>
            <li> I should have bought that one in the first place!  </li>
            <li> I have a good Panasonic ear and nose hair trimmer which works well, but it has a conical top which hides the blades, so it&#x27;s not very good at stray eyebrow hairs or the edge of an ear.</li>
            <li> whole family want one...reasonable price even has a light.</li>
            <li> Given the cost, it wasn&#x27;t worth my time to go through the hassel of returning it.    </li>
            <li> It seems ok, so far after 1 use.</li>
            <li> For the price it is a solid  performer for any road warriors that want the audience&#x27;s  rapt attention,  and not because your nose hair is dancing to it own tune.</li>
            <li> Put in a fresh battery, cleaned the terminals, etc.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer doesn&#x27;t seem overly powerful.</li>
            <li> product was effective enough when it worked.</li>
            <li> I bought this item as a gift to a friend who jokingly said he wanted one, so I for a laugh or two bought this item</li>
            <li> As seen on TV isn&#x27;t worth the money.</li>
            <li> The trimmer came with two batteries, however I was only able to fit in one.</li>
            <li> In use was only marginally effective, did not cut close.</li>
            <li> twice as powerful os</li>
            <li> I purchased this as I was looking for a detail trimmer for sideburns and eyebrows, and the adverts suggest that this is quite a powerful unit.</li>
            <li> and so far it is ok.  </li>
            <li> But then I think he will be useful to my yerno.</li>
            <li> The Micro touch max is awsome - nice and quiet</li>
            <li> The micro touch is not as powerful as was advertised.</li>
            <li> Also, the battery dies pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> There are several nice features, and it trimmed pretty effectively, BUT it broke after the second time I used it.  </li>
            <li> Good luck on anything other than a prepubescent&#x27;s peach fuzz.  </li>
            <li> wasn&#x27;t exactly what I expected, Bought it for my husband and he said it was ok for all but the nose,tickled to the point of not being able to use it .</li>
            <li> I had problems with this right out of the box.  </li>
            <li> a glowing review, right?</li>
            <li> Tried it and it broke right away, I could not even trim a bit on my face.</li>
            <li> right</li>
            <li> but even if you do have a larger trimmer, this can still come in handy for situations and areas where a larger &amp; more powerful trimmer won&#x27;t work as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it broke on the very first use and upon inspection I determined that it was not mad very well at all</li>
            <li> Purchased 2 of these trimmers and both have on / off switches that are very tempermental, you have to play with it in order for the motor to run at full speed.</li>
            <li> Great stocking stuffer or small gift.</li>
            <li> Small compact size makes it great for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly suprised that there was no pain, so I moved around a little.  </li>
            <li> You can get about 3 good uses out of it before it starts to break down.</li>
            <li> that use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer features an LED light, great for tough to see areas.  </li>
            <li> After around 3 weeks the light stopped working even with a new battery.</li>
            <li> Pure junk!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s under powered and jams easily making it necessary to dismantle and clean throughly each time you use it.</li>
            <li> Does not work half as good as they make it look.</li>
            <li> threw it in the trash as it would cost more to send it back then its worth.</li>
            <li> The product is very very cheap and the switch is fragile.  </li>
            <li> Second it is very cheaply made.</li>
            <li> So, if you need those pesky little hairs trimmed and don&#x27;t mind throwing the dice that you&#x27;ll get a good unit, give this a try.</li>
            <li> The price is right, the shipping was super and the product works better than expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s about time someone came up with a hair remover that really works!  </li>
            <li> First it is battery powered (AAA)</li>
            <li> First, it wouldn&#x27;t come on then once I got it turned on</li>
            <li> First one did not work company replaced with no problum.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m pretty bummed out.</li>
            <li> The light works well so far</li>
            <li> I would like to review this product ,but unfortunately never received it .</li>
            <li> subsequently bought a much better one here on Amazon manufactured by ToiletTree Products.  </li>
            <li> I had to pass by about ten times each brow for it to get the results I was satisfied with.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it for 4 minutes for my nose hairs</li>
            <li> For these uses I found the trimmer to perform really well; did a nice job keeping an even line and removing only as much hair as I aimed it to do.  </li>
            <li> I ended up wasting money on my first trimmer even though it was pretty inexpensive.</li>
            <li> This second trimmer is still okay though.</li>
            <li> we consumers buy these days, what with so many being made outside the USA.</li>
            <li> It worked the first time I turned it on then wouldn&#x27;t come on.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t save packaging or would have returned it, do like it when it works though - thanks anyway!</li>
            <li> First of all, the picture shows this product in the package.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had two of these and both quit working after the first time.</li>
            <li> I was quite surprised to find out that his hair trimmer has a built in light which I didn&#x27;t even notice in the infomercial.</li>
            <li> At first I thought it was the batteries.</li>
            <li> Item arrived early, light on shaver has not functioned from the start.  </li>
            <li> Just thought the product was promoted better than it actually is.</li>
            <li> :), and it works well, for various parts of my head.</li>
            <li> It insured them that I most likely would not return it as I would give up the $17.97 they charged to receive it</li>
            <li> I bought this as I have short hair and wanted to be able to get my neck.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve consistently tried to get it to work</li>
            <li> This can&#x27;t be the first time this has happen to a Micro Touch Max Hair Remover.</li>
            <li> First of all it hurts my nostrils.  </li>
            <li> This does exactly what it says.  </li>
            <li> I bought this as a cheap, quick way to remove facial hair and sideburns.</li>
            <li> It lacks power overall but the longer blade and shape of the trimmer are a plus its good for the above mentioned uses.</li>
            <li> Very seldom does one of mine last more than a month or two.  </li>
            <li> The extra attachments it comes with are good for different areas for hair removal.  </li>
            <li> It is not robustly designed and its very flimsy—did not like this one bit—Philips similar style could have been a better option.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately as I have had it for some time now, the best quality pieces in the whole system are the nail clippers.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it for side burns, the on off button is a bit awkward not as easy as the earlier version was better, but in the end I still use the product and am happy with the price and quality of the product</li>
            <li> So far the only extra accessory used was the lint brush which works great.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to groom really well!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Setup of this product was easy - simply insert the included battery, close it up, and turn it on</li>
            <li> It certainly does what you say it does.</li>
            <li> or if you have large areas of hair that need trimming...</li>
            <li> The blade is fairly large and you would not recommend it for nose or ears.&lt;br</li>
            <li> PURE JUNK.</li>
            <li> Again, it&#x27;s a good product, but doesn&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
            <li> nice little gadget which lasted about 2 uses before breaking.</li>
            <li> nifty little travel case that came with my sample is worth much more than the trimmer</li>
            <li> Using duracell AAA battery cheap waste of money.and did not get a free battery w/mine,uses 1battery.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really know, it came broke.</li>
            <li> The 2nd one trims, but the light doesnt work..</li>
            <li> Thanks for nothing.</li>
            <li> This is a real piece of junk.</li>
            <li> Does some of the things as advertised but doesn&#x27;t trim between nose and mustache very well.  </li>
            <li> And the battery really will not pull the razor.</li>
            <li> Now, ONLY the light works.</li>
            <li> B003ZW9LOQ Micro Touch Max Hair Remover]], batteries burn out too fast.</li>
            <li> I probably wasn&#x27;t expecting much with this shaver.</li>
            <li> I bought this for  $3, I wasn&#x27;t expecting much.</li>
            <li> very neat.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Product - not so much.</li>
            <li> Very unreliable.</li>
            <li> It really helps me see how well a job it is doing--or</li>
            <li> what we wanted and very pleased!&lt;br /&gt;THANK</li>
            <li> My husband used it to trim his neck and sideburns and it worked well, but it did not do much for his arm hairs which he likes to keep shaved because he is a mechanic</li>
            <li> Only 4 stars because the led light didn&#x27;t work on mine.  </li>
            <li> It cut hair very well for me.</li>
            <li> If you have, then you have probably wondered just how well those products really work.  </li>
            <li> As of this writing, the product page is very sparse on details.  </li>
            <li> After anticipating its arrival and talking about it so much, it never gets used</li>
            <li> and it really dosnt work like the commercials</li>
            <li> After ready the reviews,</li>
            <li> I ordered this product based on an infomercial and really feel taken.</li>
            <li> Having received it today, I realize why they ripped me for so much of a shipping charge.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast.</li>
            <li> and you are ready to go.  </li>
            <li> You really get what you pay for--</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t really push it in.  </li>
            <li> Neither of them really worked all that well.</li>
            <li> I only kept it because I remembered I got it cheap at CVS (I think)</li>
            <li> (but, I wasn&#x27;t really looking.)</li>
            <li> I purchased this micro touch and it worked really well for six months.  </li>
            <li> It needs to be returned but the only reason I didn&#x27;t is because it was so cheap</li>
            <li> so you buy another oppurtunity in to see your offer thanks</li>
            <li> I bought this to help with my husbands neck area and it does not work very well.  </li>
            <li> Broke after 1st use very disapointed will never buy again</li>
            <li> Also it doesn&#x27;t cut hair very well, but loves to cut into flesh....</li>
            <li> they offer the free additional items because they may be worth the money spent on this item.  </li>
            <li> First off no battery; Then when new AAA battery was inserted it continued to fall out.  </li>
            <li> Purchased Microtouch Max at a local Walgreens and excitedly  </li>
            <li> point to bear in mind is that for the length of time that the MicroTouch works, it works extremely well, shaving hair closely but safely.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s better for other parts of the body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Much better than the other brands</li>
            <li> Junk.. Bring back the original..</li>
            <li> And while this would be a total ripoff at its SRP of 30 bucks, it is now 6 and change here, and that is exactly what I think it&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> Over on the product&#x27;s web site, IdeaVillage more actively advertises the wonder of the Micro Touch Max.  </li>
            <li> Have tried several in the past, but have heard great reviews on this one.</li>
            <li> It works as advertised, but after one successful use I had trouble trying to use it a second time.  </li>
            <li> My old trimmer works just as good if not better.</li>
            <li> The accessories look nice, but I don&#x27;t expect them to last long.</li>
            <li> i purchased this item for my husband for christmas, it worked, barely, the first time and has now died!</li>
            <li> only thing true on add is you won&#x27;t cut yourself ?</li>
            <li> and it is not worth more than the shipping charge.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with the seller&#x27;s handling of my order, however, the quality of the product is somewhat less than I had hoped for.</li>
            <li> I previously purchased one of these by Panasonic years ago and love it.  </li>
            <li> While this product does work after a fashion it definitely is not as fast and easy as they say.</li>
            <li> They must know it is junk and are trying to sell as many as possible, as quickly as possible.</li>
            <li> It does a decent job of trimming--the main purpose of this unit.    </li>
            <li> It is not what the older ones used to be.</li>
            <li> I chose this over a phillips trimmer mainly cus of the price</li>
            <li> and then it started running steady then would stop.  </li>
            <li> I bought it mainly to trim my nose hairs and the hair on my neck.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to others.</li>
            <li> Not a quality product, but should not have high expectations for $10.  </li>
            <li> its a decent little unit, works ok.</li>
            <li> The whole feel of this thing is light and flimsy feeling, and a piece of the trimmer end has already broke, even though I was very careful with it.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, the build seems a little better than others have indicated.</li>
            <li> Which is where this little thing excels; because the tiny blades are exposed, you can cut within millimeters of where you want it, so it&#x27;s great for eyebrows and ear hair, the only thing I need it for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is ideal for cutting your pesky pubic hair.</li>
            <li> Having tried what was supposed to be a better-quality trimmer made by Norelco, and found that it didn&#x27;t cut hair nearly as well as the MicroTouch, I made another purchase of the latter (my third in the last 6 years) and am very glad that I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many</li>
            <li> But if it does, then you&#x27;re getting a service well worth six bucks, especially if you have unruly hairs declaring war on your ears and</li>
            <li> I bought this product thinking it was as powerful as regular clippers</li>
            <li> Not even worth it to mail it back</li>
            <li> This product did not meet my expectation at all, it is not practical, it is only a toy rather than a useful tool.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Of course, why not just use a normal razor then?  </li>
            <li> But, when you consider what you get for the current price of about $6, it is definitely worth buying if you have the need.  </li>
            <li> I even put in fresh batteries, but the results were the same.</li>
            <li> Motor not as strong as more expensive brands.</li>
            <li> I was right, it definitely has a place.  </li>
            <li> The switch mechanism sloppy with a fair amount of play that contributes to the motor sounding funky.  </li>
            <li> The switch mechanism sloppy with a fair amount of play that contributes to the motor sounding funky.  </li>
            <li> I could have purchased it from Amazon or other site for $9.50 and in some cases free shipping as I found out after receiving the Micro Touch Max.</li>
            <li> even tried new batteries.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried new battery and even tested the battery streangh with a volt meter.  </li>
            <li> I can agree when people say that even with a new battery this device doesnt pack a punch.  </li>
            <li> Well, you live and you learn.</li>
            <li> Looking for something new I came upon this.  </li>
            <li> The Micro Touch has found it&#x27;s new home in the bottom of my tool box to be used maybe as a door stop.</li>
            <li> Plus the product came in bubble wrap so can&#x27;t even tell if it&#x27;s new.</li>
            <li> I tried 2 sets of brand new batteries...no improvement.  </li>
            <li> This new model I&#x27;ve been just throwing into the drawer after use</li>
            <li> /&gt;Third, product was so cheap it wasn&#x27;t worth the effort to return, or file a complaint.</li>
            <li> It is cheaply made, which is why I would recommend something more expensive if you will be using it a lot</li>
            <li> I recently replaced mine with the Philips Norelco, which is far superior, and only slightly more expensive than the MicroTouch.</li>
            <li> The major downside is the build quality but for the price I can&#x27;t complain much.</li>
            <li> First off I only it use for nose hairs and eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Exactly like the one sold on TV, only 1/3 the cost.</li>
            <li> In my experience, the same cannot be said for the Norelco NT9110 (the model that I tried and abandoned after one use); and from what I&#x27;ve read, none of the other devices in this category perform any, if at all, better.</li>
            <li> But it is not expensive either, and it comes with a \\&quot;free\\&quot; personal care zippered case loaded with all kinds of goodies:  Clippers, comb, file, toothbrush, tweezers, lint remover and shoe</li>
            <li> This is different than the first one.</li>
            <li> wow!</li>
            <li> The shoehorn is small and may work better as a tongue</li>
            <li> The only thing that is not plastic are the nail trimmers and tweezers and the tweezers are pretty worthless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only way I could use it was as a trimmer after I used scissors, which defeats the purpose in the first place.  </li>
            <li> Cheap, barely works, loose connections in battery compartment</li>
            <li> It boggs down even on something light like the hair on your arm.</li>
            <li> One of them had a non-working light right out of the package, but hey, who needs a light on a hair cutting tool?</li>
            <li> I ordered this product to replace a previous one of same name and design that I physically bought at a retail store that worked great for a long time and just got worn out.</li>
            <li> It will also trim small amounts of hair near the top of your ears in between cuts and can trim your eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I owned a similar, but less &amp;#34;fancy&amp;#34; model of a personal grooming tool and this new one is much nicer and works better.</li>
            <li> Line up the two dots and things will fit tightly.  </li>
            <li> However, I would not recommend this product for removing large amounts of hairs, such as chest or leg hair.  </li>
            <li> controller seems a little cheaply made.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product with the intention of using it once or twice till it broke; apparently my expectations were to high.</li>
            <li> this little charmer does an outstanding job but don&#x27;t expect it to last forever.</li>
            <li> It kind of works, but it&#x27;s very weak and too much hair will make it turn off.</li>
            <li> Secondly, it doesn&#x27;t do a very good job of cutting.  </li>
            <li> Then after six uses it died completely.</li>
            <li> The light went out literally a few seconds after I turned it on.</li>
            <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME &amp; MONEY.</li>
            <li> wow save your money</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised it&#x27;s not at all listed in the description.&lt;br</li>
            <li> OLD ONE</li>
            <li> cheap broke after a few times i used it..</li>
            <li> As far as the hair remover part it works as advertised.</li>
            <li> When physically comparing the two  this version is much cheaper</li>
            <li> It even lets you change a battery whaich the old model did not.</li>
            <li> Local lighting is very helpful too.</li>
            <li> I did not realize what was contained in the so called Delux Grooming Kit but the contents I already have, so it was a wasted add-on for Free but with $6.99 shipping</li>
            <li> If you expect to do a complete haircut and sideburns trim</li>
            <li> The light did not work out of the box and it seems like it always takes a few seconds for it to get up to speed.</li>
            <li> Light works but motor is dead.  </li>
            <li> It also does cause a pinch on your skin in sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> and I think it works very well as a facial hair trimmer.  </li>
            <li> This is really meant for smaller areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I only really bought it to use with the adapters</li>
            <li> The real kicker, and the reason for the one star, is that neither tool cut hair close enough to make a difference.</li>
            <li> But even if it were solid with a quality feel, I really couldn&#x27;t recommend it anyway.  </li>
            <li> When they do run fast enough they work well.</li>
            <li> Really, it doesn&#x27;t seem to make sense to do so as the blades of the Micro Touch Max are at the wrong angle for that kind of work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, if you need something more heavy duty or for larger areas, you are going to want to look elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample</li>
            <li> If it starts working annoyingly slowly, just be sure to try replacing the batteries.</li>
            <li> It took a few tries, but the Micro Touch effectively shaved that area.&lt;br /&gt;Both</li>
            <li> It trimmed one brow fine, but the other was left with a patch that looked like singed hairs.</li>
            <li> in all, if the product was £3 it would be about the right price, and only for very occasional use.</li>
            <li> For a mustache, you have to scrape it across your upper lip a couple hundred time just to get MOST of the hair off and for sideburns, it just plain doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> The unit is severely underpowered - which is especially a problem with hair trimming as it will have the tendency to drag hairs rather than giving a clean cut.</li>
            <li> The only issue I had with it was that the battery that came with was dead and that was an easy fix.</li>
            <li> I first got it, I gingerly inserted it into a nostril and carefully turned it on.  </li>
            <li> Ive used it around 3 times, seems to hold up so far despite other rating I see that say it broke after the first time or never worked.</li>
            <li> amazon good enough to take it back, but really poor quality item.</li>
            <li> Is it a solid little unit for light duty trimming nose,  ear,  and misc body hair,  yes.</li>
            <li> Expected a little better shaver.</li>
            <li> - There is a light, it does work, but the location of it is such that little to no illumination gets to the work</li>
            <li> I put a brand new battery in it and tried it out on the hair on back of my neck.  </li>
            <li> Finally, the blade holder would not stay shut, so I decided it was time for a new nose/ear trimmer.</li>
            <li> Battery went dead quick...</li>
            <li> My first trimmer would work once I had it on the &amp;#34;ON&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Light&amp;#34; setting, but the blade cutters wouldn&#x27;t cut pieces of my hairs properly whenever I would put the trimmer directly on my facial and bodily hairs.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and small enough to take as a travel item.</li>
            <li> Based on the price and quality it is not worth more than half a star</li>
            <li> badly constructed, flimsy, falling apart, the original was a much better product, almost junk 6 dmore words required eenough aleady</li>
            <li> No, his hair was either too thick or too fine,</li>
            <li> So I bought it and the dang thing is cheap hard plastic.  </li>
            <li> It lasted MAYBE 30 seconds, and the motor stopped working, but at least the light continued to work</li>
            <li> It was whole one second and in a bunch of pieces the next second.  </li>
            <li> It barely trims anything.</li>
            <li> Im surprised that Amazon would allow such junk to be sold from their site.</li>
            <li> Basically a piece of junk that when you can get it to turn on it barely trims any hair at all.</li>
            <li> it does cut you if you are not careful.</li>
            <li> Razors only cut this sensitive area.</li>
            <li> The thing barely runs.  </li>
            <li> On the minus side, it is barely capable of trimming any hair at all.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> Apparently, this doesn&#x27;t matter.</li>
            <li> and they barely run.</li>
            <li> Takes me 2-3 times as long to trim my face then it does with my normal rechargeable shaver.</li>
            <li> Even with a fresh battery in it, (and it only takes one), this thing slows down and stalls even in use with the lightest hair.  </li>
            <li> I only really use this the odd stray eyebrow hair, which it manages (but surely that is the least you would expect from this product).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Trimmers are usually not the best products, but this thing is the worst I have ever seen.</li>
            <li> This particular model is intended to be used occasionally because it is made out of plastic parts and will not survive constant daily use.</li>
            <li> Mine lasted for a couple months, then unexpectedly the light stopped working even when i would change the batteries, and the shaver would be really weak depending on how i tilted it.</li>
            <li> Sipping was much faster than I expected, so that was a big plus.</li>
            <li> So, why should anyone be surprised that a device costing only $10 would last any longer?&#x27;&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would classify it as somewhat fragile in that I really doubt it would survive a fall onto bathroom tile, so I would treat it carefully.  </li>
            <li> and I have to shake the trimmer a little to get it to run higher.</li>
            <li> But once I fiddle with it a bit, it works fine, and the blades work well, cutting small hairs fast and cleanly.</li>
            <li> I have had 2 other ones from the same company and they were much sharper and stronger.</li>
            <li> This was my second time ordering the same trimmer, because the other one that I ordered the first time and received didn&#x27;t work properly.</li>
            <li> and it barely even trimmed any of his facial hair.  </li>
            <li> Within the first few uses the power would seem to \\&quot;surge\\&quot; on the device.  </li>
            <li> Then the blades quickly became dull and started to pull hair instead of cut.</li>
            <li> Afterwards we noticed that the amount charged was more then expected turns out despite her having clicked the razor only they had added the stupid grooming kit on top charging us the S&amp;H for that.  </li>
            <li> I then ordered a Micro Touch Max Trimmer for the second time and didn&#x27;t have as much trouble than the first one.</li>
            <li> First of all, it is not very effective as nasal hair trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Works okay on ordinary basis, but not very well with different applications, and unfortunately one function (light) does´nt work on both items bought</li>
            <li> I had a similar product that lasted for 6 years, until it got a little wet, and then it started acting up, but this one seems to be a little better protected against moisture.  </li>
            <li> A cheep piece of junk not worth any where near the price, if they sold it for a dime it would be over priced!!</li>
            <li> I was watching this commercial and saw the tiny little thing falling apart and googled to see who really bought this and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to throw good money after bad.</li>
            <li> B000FYVOJC Panasonic ER430K Nose, Ear &amp; Facial Hair Trimmer Wet/Dry with Vacuum Cleaning System]],</li>
            <li> Because the fit of the cover was sloppy I took the trimmer apart several times, thinking I must have not put it together correctly.</li>
            <li> My new trimmer broke down after only two weeks of use!!!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;In summary, if you&#x27;re willing to buy something cheap with the expectation that it&#x27;s not going to last too long, then the Micro Touch Max isn&#x27;t a bad choice for some general grooming.  </li>

            <li> Amazon should hang its head in shame for even selling this piece of junk - it barely works at all, one would be better off cutting each tiny short hair one by one with a finger nail clipped than using this product</li>
            <li> I ordered at a time when the order was taken by electronic messages and there was not a chance to talk to a real person and further I was not able to determine the final cost.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very expensive piece of junk made doubly so because I allowed myself to be conned into getting the deluxe model.</li>
            <li> I called a day later and found out the true cost that was billed to my credit card and was not a happy camper.</li>
            <li> My second trimmer still needed some improvements, especially with a very precise cutting blade.</li>
            <li> This is a decent little trimmer for limited use (small areas of hair where another trimmer might be too large, too likely to cut you, or too inaccurate).</li>
            <li> It works a little better with an attachment, but near useless when used with just the clippers and running it over any hair at all.  </li>
            <li> dose not last as long and dose not cut well</li>
            <li> but then, how long does a straight-edge razor last?</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> last quite a long time.</li>
            <li> The motor inside sounds weak and doesn&#x27;t run at a constant speed, even with fresh batteries and it not doing any work.  </li>
            <li> The motor inside sounds weak and doesn&#x27;t run at a constant speed, even with fresh batteries and it not doing any work.  </li>
            <li> I came to find that I was completely spot on and am sorry for all those who actually spent MONEY that was earned through tedious movemenets of your everyday life on this product that is now gently LAYING on your bathroom counter untouched and dissatisfied from the lack of contact along with the idea that it no longer attractive.</li>
            <li> My previous trimmers all had the cutter on the top, and it was usually small and round.  </li>
            <li> Dont waste your money on this product though they will not back up their own workmanship which is very poor.</li>
            <li> Does not last very long.</li>
            <li> It is poorly made of cheap plastic and other flimsy components.  </li>
            <li> if there was an actual chance that my original claim was proven wrong.  </li>
            <li> Light is also useless.</li>
            <li> Difficult to be precise &amp; it doesn&#x27;t seem to work at all w the combs included.</li>
            <li> Will wait to see how long it lasts.</li>
            <li> Do not buy, a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> A complete waste of money.  </li>
            <li> a complete waste of money.  </li>
            <li> The Micro Touch trimmed the long, bushy eyebrows, but didn&#x27;t work on shorter eyebrows.</li>
            <li> but it took too long.</li>
            <li> i did have minor issues with the switch since day one.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t take long at all for my microtouch max trimmer to be delivered to my home.</li>
            <li> Given that it&#x27;s all plastic snaps, I&#x27;d not expect it will take long before the Micro Touch doesn&#x27;t want to stay put</li>
            <li> Given that it&#x27;s all plastic snaps, I&#x27;d not expect it will take long before the Micro Touch doesn&#x27;t want to stay put</li>
            <li> they both still died early deaths after just a few uses each.  </li>
            <li> it was a complete waste and the company sold a piece of plastic</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I was not able to find anything I liked about it.</li>
            <li> It is cheap, but it is not worth if it is broken.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint with this type of clipper is not the fault of the clipper: my nostrils are very sensitive</li>
            <li> and right when I inserted the batteries it literally broke apart in my hands, this is a poorly made product.</li>
            <li> But with a little effort, it will trim thinner hair, leg hair (but really, why would you want to trim your legs using this little blade) fuzzy bits around your face, etc.</li>
            <li> The plastic fitting that holds the blade is not effective and continuously splits open near the cutting head.</li>
            <li> If you slightly rotate the barrel you can hear the motor speeding up and slowing down, even with a brand new Duracell</li>
            <li> I thought it might work for other jobs besides personal grooming.  </li>
            <li> Getting it back together on the other hand can be tricky.  </li>
            <li> Getting it back together on the other hand can be tricky.  </li>
            <li> Cutting too much hair at once with this trimmer may be too much for it, but that&#x27;s not the intended usage.</li>
            <li> I kept water away from them and rinsed the blades in alcohol and let them dry after each use.  </li>
            <li> First, the unit runs very slow, could never keep up with the one in the commercial.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> * single headed comb guide (6 mm)&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Limited use.</li>
            <li> Still, it feels like underpowered with just a single 1.5V AAA battery.  </li>
            <li> However, the application is somewhat functionally limited.</li>
            <li> It can&#x27;t cut a single hair.</li>
            <li> Does the job well enough but difficult to always get it at the right angle when chasing hairs in your ears.</li>
            <li> it is not worth buying and if it weren&#x27;t such a pain to return i would!!!  </li>
            <li> Not worth a penny, definitely not $5!</li>
            <li> This was the most expensive one and yet the most worthless one.</li>
            <li> Only gave it four stars due to the battery compartment doesn&#x27;t hold the battery tight enough.</li>
            <li> but I guess it is loose</li>
            <li> You have to twist the bottom part to turn it on and the pieces become loose and the power indicator line don&#x27;t line up to the &amp;#34;off,&amp;#34; &amp;#34;on,&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Like using a weed whacker or brush hog to chop down the big stuff and then finishing with a mower.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t line them up exactly, the base won&#x27;t fit tight and the movable silver ring that turns the trimmer on and off won&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> And seeing as this works well enough for me, I&#x27;d recommend it, with the previous proviso.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I actually broke off a little plastic part on the attachment trying to snap it into the trimmer.</li>
            <li> Thought I would try this as my old blade is getting dull</li>
            <li> It does not work like expected.</li>
            <li> Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> , i.e. feels like its hollow and</li>
            <li> The motor has only worked a few times.  </li>
            <li> I was curious about the functionality of this product.  </li>
            <li> Just be careful, the handle will break</li>
            <li> Everyone whoever buys this product should be careful, because it might not work well as expected.</li>
            <li> You still have to be careful though, or you could still cut</li>
            <li> i see that the catridge doesn&#x27;t work as expected</li>
            <li> The next day the battery was dead...</li>
            <li> I have been testing out the Micro Touch Max over the last few days</li>
            <li> The blades often will not start up and get jammed, and I&#x27;ve had to disassemble it often, smack it,</li>
            <li> Not much.</li>
            <li> Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> total garbage no light  wont cut anything  </li>
            <li> so far- at least it has lasted longer than other ones i have used.  </li>
            <li> It is just not strong enough.</li>
            <li> After removing the battery a few times, messing with on/off switch &amp; other tinkering around, we finally got it working again.</li>
            <li> Blade is extremely weak can barely cut facial hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You will have better luck re-assembling this little gadget when you realize that there is a dot on the inside battery holder that corresponds with the dot on the outside base case.  </li>
            <li> two - one wouldn&#x27;t turn on at all and the other would turn on but not off.  </li>
            <li> Usually, they come with the hair remover and a couple of guide combs and maybe a tiny brush for cleaning the hair</li>
            <li> Had one in the past for years and these are the same.  </li>
            <li> Such a waste of money!</li>
            <li> The blade is recessed so it is difficult to position it exactly where you want it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sharp, it hurts when pressed against the skin.</li>
            <li> It works like any other trimmer but is noisey.</li>
            <li> this doesnt not do a hole lot other then just buzz rather than removing hair.</li>
            <li> Very weak motor, never really worked very well.</li>
            <li> I was very careful with the Remingtons.  </li>
            <li> Cuts inside of nose easily and painfully.</li>
            <li> this product leaves behind the most uncomfortable length of stuble</li>
            <li> Very poorly made and very underpowered!</li>
            <li> The blade cutters were working and cutting some my hairs pretty well, but not 100% precise cutting.</li>
            <li> Micro Touch is small enough to maneuver in tight spaces.  </li>
            <li> This cutting edge is long and large.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s compact enough to reach in hard to reach areas.  </li>
            <li> This thing is extremely low powered and hardly works.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re not familiar with infomercials and their tendency for making big claims with poor acting, then you must not have a TV.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth my time or the money to return it.</li>
            <li> The shaver itself is not worth what they charge for it.</li>
            <li> Not worth one penny.</li>
            <li> All in all, I would say this is an average trimmer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will not attempt to use this for nasal hairs as the chance of dragging hair is just not worth the effort.</li>
            <li> Not worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not worth the hassle ...  </li>
            <li> IT IS NOT WORTH THE COST OF A $0.57 STAMP&lt;br /&gt;Think</li>
            <li> This is the MOST worthless item I have ever purchased.  </li>
            <li> And twisting it around a little made the cutter buzz a little faster, as if the connections were loose or something.</li>
            <li> The motor slowed down a lot once it hit some hair though.</li>
            <li> The company sent me a unit to review, and it too has the issue of the motor slowing down and speeding up a bit when the battery is not just so in its compartment.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know how it&#x27;d do, but this lil guy took like two minutes and was the cleanest shave I&#x27;ve ever had down there.</li>
            <li> turned it upside down, etc.</li>
            <li> The operation of the trimmer goes up and down</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see it working in the back area, but if you have some other hair removal project, or someone to help you reach difficult to reach areas (like the back), I suppose it would work.</li>
            <li> I used this for less than 1 minute trimmer guard fell off went down sink now</li>
            <li> Cheap, flimsy, &amp; weak!!!</li>
            <li> Hair is removed with slight tug which is felt.</li>
            <li> so at least then I will only be out the time I have wasted attempting to get the Micro Touch Max Hair Remover working.</li>
            <li> so they&#x27;re less bushy.</li>
            <li> it, with the previous proviso.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> POWER LESS.  </li>
            <li> had a micro trimmer from &amp;#34;Nikai&amp;#34; for at least 10 years which I bought locally in a closeout store for a few dollars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That machine should have been half as sturdy as the packaging which took about 6 minutes to remove...and still maintain 10 fingers.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t regret giving it a try for less than $10, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for; maybe even less</li>
            <li> It is small and can get to areas that are harder to reach like nose hairs or ears.</li>
            <li> But this new MicroTouch Max is useless the 2</li>
            <li> A new battery failed to get it to run</li>
            <li> Battery goes dead in less then 2mins.</li>
            <li> This little contraption does not shave a hair on my body.</li>
            <li> little gadget just didn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other hair trimmers in the past and none compare to my microtouch max.</li>
            <li> Stopped working with little use in 2 months.</li>
            <li> broke after little use</li>
            <li> For little jobs this&lt;br /&gt;does the trick.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I got a bad one or what, but it didn&#x27;t seem like it had the power to do the job, even after putting in a fresh battery.</li>
            <li> The actual trimmer is cheap and the motor is pathetic</li>
            <li> It is cheap, cheesy and completely useless.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time</li>
            <li> A piece was missing from the packaging.</li>
            <li> waste your money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this trimmer.</li>
            <li> If it were free it would still be a piece of crap...</li>
            <li> Stopped working after a few months.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Switching to the on position doesn&#x27;t always work; you have to toggle it a few times before it turns on.</li>
            <li> its alright, the led light is annoying but doesn&#x27;t affect the performance of the unit</li>
            <li> Instead of repair, bought another and it too died within few days.  </li>
            <li> In fact, it pulled a few hairs out of my mustache.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> It never worked and was a waste of my time and money.</li>
            <li> Bought the &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; (underpowered) one a few years ago and it worked, sorta, on and off....</li>
            <li> It worked once or twice and after a month or two it went completely dead.</li>
            <li> and I would go as far as to say that I think it is fake.</li>
            <li> a waste of money and would not recommend</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo3N9MGQLQ2K6KE]]Everything about the trimmer felt poorly made, just inserting the batteries and turning it on took multiple attempts.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> so it wouldn&#x27;t turn on unless I press firmly while twisting it on.</li>
            <li> Battery was dead or almost had to replace it.  </li>
            <li> Listen to those that say,&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Don&#x27;t waste</li>
            <li> If someone gives you this product, don&#x27;t waste your time to get it to work.</li>
            <li> This is just a waste of money.</li>
            <li> EPIC FAIL.</li>
            <li> Piece of junk &amp; a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I placed thin paper around the battery to keep it in, then another 5 minutes trying to put the battery cap back on.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used and trashed two Remington trimmers after just a few uses</li>
            <li> THEY SOMETIMES CAUSE TRAPPED HAIRS</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I have had this item for a few months.  </li>
            <li> A waste of money.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t waste my money on this if I were you.</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY .</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t waste your money on this unit.</li>
            <li> My nostril hair gets out of control, and I bought this a few months ago hoping to replace</li>
            <li> Not easy to use as it looks on tv.</li>
            <li> You can hear it slow and get bogged down immediately.  </li>
            <li> first time I used it bad choice on my part for buying woud suggest not to buy this product John Crawford</li>
            <li> Waste of money, but fortunately a small investment.</li>
            <li> I usually have to buy a few at a time in order to have it when I need it.  </li>
            <li> The toothbrush is stiff and has very few bristles.</li>
            <li> I purchased from a different outlet,  but felt the negative reviews are a little unfair.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> Talk about robbing the public blind.  </li>
            <li> Not sure how this product made it to the stores.</li>
            <li> Laying and hold the edge of the cutters against my skin produced nothing but a small tingle, and that was from the vibration of the unit while in operation.  </li>
            <li> I was not able to do this task with this trimmer.</li>
            <li> so Im not sure</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend anyone purchasing this product, its not safe.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Couple that with the fact that this thing has the head on a 15 degree angled AWAY from rest of the &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34;, and it becomes impossible to make any decent contact with the hair (whether sideburns neck hairs, etc.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> works land does not cut skin.bad packaging, difficult to open.</li>
            <li> So I crammed it in past the point of comfort, and rubbed it in the thickest patch of nostril hairs.  </li>
            <li> Mine also came with a grooming kit (not sure if it still does</li>
            <li> I usually do.  </li>
            <li> Waste of time and money!</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> but using it for anything other than fuzz could be frustrating..</li>
            <li> It lasts less than a week, falls apart when you change the battery and clean the head... awful!</li>
            <li> The cutting blades are not sharp and it has NO power at all.</li>
            <li> but its pretty annoying.    </li>
            <li> Not worth returning but poorly made (in China), nonfunctional light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> However it is obviously poor quality and not worth buying.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve found that they are pretty worthless.</li>
            <li> Thick hair around the base of the neck also requires multiple passes, but works well in trimming the long hair around your ears for example.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s getting the blades in position to cut that is the hard part, and</li>
            <li> was hard just to turn as the switch was not working</li>
            <li> Hardly trims nose hair at all.</li>
            <li> This thing runs so very slowly that you can almost count the revolutions of the uneven motor.</li>
            <li> This product sucks.</li>
            <li> The fact that it was so inexpensive keeps it from being a total disappointment.</li>
            <li> At least during the product&#x27;s lifetime, it works the way it should.</li>
            <li> will be filing a formal complaint with the FL State Attorney Generals office and</li>
            <li> At least it&#x27;s an inexpensive product.  </li>
            <li> Shipping is slow.</li>
            <li> It does not trim thick hair on men&#x27;s arms or backs like they show in the commercials unless you go over it again and again.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money like I did!!</li>
            <li> At this point due to the time frame, we are unable to replace the item for you.</li>
            <li> I have been taken and only wish I had read all the reviews before ordering and if I still remained stupid after doing so, I should have ordered form a sorce offering it for less money.</li>
            <li> But it is useless as anything other than a weak vibrator/ flashlight combo.</li>
            <li> so its cutting power is limited.</li>
            <li> the way the tip is angled is a little weird for me.</li>
            <li> Not a good product.</li>
            <li> Not a good product.</li>
            <li> Not a good product.</li>
            <li> This thing is poor construction, poor engineering, poor quality, doesn&#x27;t work, don&#x27;t waste your time.</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money, very poorly made.</li>
            <li> I does trim the nose hairs (without the dangerous aspect of having to insert sharp scissors into your nose and pray you don&#x27;t cut yourself) and ear hair.</li>
            <li> I thought maybe I just got a bad egg, but after reviewing the absurd amount of one star reviews clearly they are all made junky.  </li>
            <li> This item is the most worthless piece of crap</li>
            <li> a truelly worthless pile of junk.you&#x27;ll have better luck with a pair of preschool safety scissors,,,John Wayne Trimmer- won&#x27;t take crap off of anything..........</li>
            <li> The motor is so weak, it basically stops working when you try to trim hair.</li>
            <li> , It&#x27;s a really dumb product.</li>
            <li> So disappointed that it stopped working after two weeks, totally died, changed the battery, and cleaned it inside and out.</li>
            <li> returned it - too weak and ineffective</li>
            <li> The motor is way too weak and it doesn&#x27;t do what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  </li>
            <li> Having the blades on the side is tough getting used to.  </li>
            <li> This is a tough one.  </li>
            <li> This is a tough one.  </li>

            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for quality, you&#x27;re looking at the wrong product.</li>

            <li> This is a horrible waste of money and I can not recommend others to buy what I consider to be a poor as seen on TV product!</li>
            <li> Gets to all the awkward places.</li>

            <li> This product is very lousy and does not work as specified.  </li>
            <li> The cutters cut, and were not &amp;#34;recessed&amp;#34; like this piece of junk, making it very difficult to even contact the hair adequately.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I see that this thing has a ton of bad reviews here, and that the blades don&#x27;t work for some, the battery for others, etc.</li>
            <li> I felt so bad because my husband was looking forward to this product</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s as bad as they say, Amazon would have removed it\\&quot;..  </li>
            <li> im going to return it. :(</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really know, it came broke.</li>
            <li> Much better than I thought it would be. Gets to all the awkward places. Use in conjunction with wet razor for a complete shave.</li>
            <li> Lol I used this thing once and it broke. This is an extremely poor quality hair remover... Don&#x27;t buy it!</li>
            <li> I had to buy this one because the last one just feel apart after a couple of uses.  It was whole one second and in a bunch of pieces the next second.  I hope it was just a isolated case and this one works better.</li>
            <li> Purchased 2 of these trimmers and both have on / off switches that are very tempermental, you have to play with it in order for the motor to run at full speed. Would not purchase another one.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 of these shavers at the same time, and the 1st one didnt work at all, so I had to send it back. The 2nd one trims, but the light doesnt work..I would NOT recommend this to friends</li>
            <li> I placed an order online at the microtouch site a month ago.  After receiving a call from the company asking me to sign up for something else they were selling, I refused and received a notice telling me that it would be another month before I saw the product. Don&#x27;t waste your time</li>
            <li> the product doesn&#x27;t work well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I got a bad one or what, but it didn&#x27;t seem like it had the power to do the job, even after putting in a fresh battery. And twisting it around a little made the cutter buzz a little faster, as if the connections were loose or something. Poor build quality, but what do you expect for $12?</li>
            <li> I rather pluck the hairs one by one then use this crap.!!</li>
            <li> My only complaint with this type of clipper is not the fault of the clipper: my nostrils are very sensitive so I can only use it for a short time.</li>
            <li> I did not buy it through Amazon but I want to warn any future buyers.  JUNK!!  And the 800 number tells you to go to a website which tells you to send an email.  I doubt that I will ever get my money back.</li>
            <li> I have found hair that I didn&#x27;t even know I had.  I AM CLEAN!!!  YOU KNOW WHAT&#x27;S UP!!!</li>
            <li> Does not trim nose and ear hair at all. Would not purchase this product ever again.</li>
            <li> A piece was missing from the packaging. The light attached to the shaver never even worked. Thanks for nothing. This product sucks.</li>
            <li> Not quite up to my expectations and the TV ad for this product.  The fact that it was so inexpensive keeps it from being a total disappointment.</li>
            <li> I have given the Micro Touch Max just one star only because there isn&#x27;t a lesser category. It&#x27;s a very expensive piece of junk made doubly so because I allowed myself to be conned into getting the deluxe model. It&#x27;s under powered and jams easily making it necessary to dismantle and clean throughly each time you use it. Then after six uses it died completely. A battery change and cleaning did nothing to revive it. So why didn&#x27;t I return and get a replacement under the warranty? They wanted me to pay the postage both ways to fix their problem. with no guarantee that the replacement will be any better. I&#x27;m not going to throw good money after bad.</li>
            <li> Thanks for a very great product. It certainly does what you say it does. I loved doing my eyebrows for the first time in my life by myself!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be back when I need another!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks agai!</li>
            <li> First off I only it use for nose hairs and eyebrows. I&#x27;ve this product for about a month works just fine the light works just fine and it does its job. It lacks power overall but the longer blade and shape of the trimmer are a plus its good for the above mentioned uses. I don&#x27;t use it for side burns, the on off button is a bit awkward not as easy as the earlier version was better, but in the end I still use the product and am happy with the price and quality of the product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s about time someone came up with a hair remover that really works!  This one does it all.  The price is right, the shipping was super and the product works better than expected. Will buy from this company again and again.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this, or from this company. The instructions even say it includes a battery, not mine. It doesn&#x27;t work so I&#x27;m guessing they are selling returned or 2nd hand products. It&#x27;s not worth my time or the money to return it. I threw it in the trash.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it cuts well and sometimes it takes several times to cut the hair.</li>
            <li> Pure junk!  I&#x27;ve used these types of trimmers for years. This was the most expensive one and yet the most worthless one. It barely trims anything. I use them to clean up my husbands neck after a hair cut, side burns, etc. This doesn&#x27;t do anything, as if there isn&#x27;t even a blade on it?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money. This is one of the junkiest products ever.</li>
            <li> Works well.  Not as effective as a nose hair trimmer as hoped.  On/off controller seems a little cheaply made.  Will wait to see how long it lasts.</li>
            <li> Absolutely worthless. Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> I opened the package and broke it trying to turn it on. Terrible. I&#x27;m going to get my money back now.</li>
            <li> This product is very lousy and does not work as specified.  I put a brand new battery in it and tried it out on the hair on back of my neck.  It immediately grabbed the hair and started pulling.  I tried another battery and it did the same thing.  I was afraid to trim my nose hairs with it because it has no power to cut hair of any type.  The light did not even work on it.  No wonder on TV they offer the free additional items because they may be worth the money spent on this item.  I don&#x27;t believe I can return it because I thru the original packing away.  DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM PLEASE YOU WILL REGRET IT!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Best pube trimmer ever</li>
            <li> I ordered this trimmer on Tuesday 2/21 and got it on Thursday 2/23. The trimmer works great, same as the one I had to replace. The only issue I had with it was that the battery that came with was dead and that was an easy fix.</li>
            <li> Does not work. Doesn&#x27;t cut hair as advertised. Do not buy, a complete waste of money. Junk junk junk junk</li>
            <li> There is nothing good to say about this product. The motor is so weak, it basically stops working when you try to trim hair. The light went out literally a few seconds after I turned it on. I ended up throwing it away. Its so crappy I&#x27;m embarrassed that I actually purchased it!</li>
            <li> did not work as advertise.&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend it. don&#x27;t buy&lt;br /&gt;battery dose not last as long and dose not cut well</li>
            <li> Works just as advertised.  I had a similar product that lasted for 6 years, until it got a little wet, and then it started acting up, but this one seems to be a little better protected against moisture.  Great Product.</li>
            <li> This works occasionally. The plastic fitting that holds the blade is not effective and continuously splits open near the cutting head. The switch is intermittent.</li>
            <li> Good Product but dont buy it here. You can get the same in Walgreens for 9.99, Don&#x27;t buy it here</li>
            <li> Works just like it should..I like it ! If you need a personal groomer this one works just fine...based on three usages .</li>
            <li> I have never gotten a product from a tv promo that worked.  This is a real piece of junk. I bought two - one wouldn&#x27;t turn on at all and the other would turn on but not off.  If the promoters paid $.25 for each one then they got ripped off too.  When will I learn not to believe these lies?  No one answers the customer service number and the 202 367 9968 number that they use to call you to verify your address is not answered when you call them. I called my credit card company to credit my account back for this amount.</li>
            <li> First, the unit runs very slow, could never keep up with the one in the commercial.&lt;br /&gt;I even tried new batteries.&lt;br /&gt;Second there is supposed to be a light at the tip, but it does not work.&lt;br /&gt;Third, product was so cheap it wasn&#x27;t worth the effort to return, or file a complaint.</li>
            <li> I saw this advertised on TV while I was in Canada and it looked good so when we returned home we ordered it.  During the order process my wife clicked on the shaver alone and she checked out. Afterwards we noticed that the amount charged was more then expected turns out despite her having clicked the razor only they had added the stupid grooming kit on top charging us the S&amp;H for that.  The shaver itself is not worth what they charge for it. First it is battery powered (AAA) so it has no real power and it cuts horrible. Takes me 2-3 times as long to trim my face then it does with my normal rechargeable shaver. This is a horrible waste of money and I can not recommend others to buy what I consider to be a poor as seen on TV product!</li>
            <li> Hair trimmer has no power to do what the add for it says ,very dissatisfied tried better batteries still didn&#x27;t work .The only thing true on add is you won&#x27;t cut yourself ? Light is also useless.</li>
            <li> This product never cut as close as a blade and only worked once before breaking. Conceptually it&#x27;s a nice idea, but the quality isn&#x27;t there, so I would avoid this product.</li>
            <li> I cut my own hair and had problems maintaining a clean look around my ears..Problem solved with this product. I have already recommended this product to my friends..</li>
            <li> Exactly like the one sold on TV, only 1/3 the cost. There may be others that are stronger, but this is great for the price. Shipping is slow.</li>
            <li> This is the worst product, I have ever purchased. In under three minutes it was no longer working. They must know it is junk and are trying to sell as many as possible, as quickly as possible. It will be gone from the market shortly. Im surprised that Amazon would allow such junk to be sold from their site. Caveat Emptor!! Some people say they replace this every three to five years, making it a good bargain. I think you would have to replace it, every three to five minutes!</li>
            <li> Well designed product for trimming hair.</li>
            <li> The Pros:  It does a decent job of trimming--the main purpose of this unit.    The Cons:  The light never worked.  Having the blades on the side is tough getting used to.  My previous trimmers all had the cutter on the top, and it was usually small and round.  This cutting edge is long and large.  I find it more difficult to angle the unit to clip both my nose and my ears than the top-cut models.    Overall, the unit does cut well.  It&#x27;s getting the blades in position to cut that is the hard part, and like I said, the light never worked from day one.</li>
            <li> This item is very cheap.  The light didn&#x27;t work from the start.  The battery needed to be installed at an angle to work.  I tried new battery and even tested the battery streangh with a volt meter.  The problem was with the design of the unit I received.  Given the cost, it wasn&#x27;t worth my time to go through the hassel of returning it.    The seller did a good job getting the item to me though.</li>
            <li> i purchased this item for my husband for christmas, it worked, barely, the first time and has now died! Not impressed at all! im going to return it. :(</li>
            <li> Does some of the things as advertised but doesn&#x27;t trim between nose and mustache very well.  That said, it&#x27;s better than others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Save your money, this is poorly made junk.  It lasted MAYBE 30 seconds, and the motor stopped working, but at least the light continued to work so I could find the trash can to toss it away.</li>
            <li> It does not work like expected. Tried it on my sons neck and it hurt him. And the battery really will not pull the razor. It boggs down even on something light like the hair on your arm. I do not recommend.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this trimmer. It is poorly made of cheap plastic and other flimsy components.  Trimmers are usually not the best products, but this thing is the worst I have ever seen. A complete waste of money.  I&#x27;d stick with hairy ears before I&#x27;d buy this piece of garbage.</li>
            <li> Useless product does not perform as specified, would not buy again</li>
            <li> Even bought new name brand batteries and neither worked - at all not one iota of power - don&#x27;t buy this - get another brand that is easily found in any drug or dept store!</li>
            <li> It seems ok, so far after 1 use. The motor slowed down a lot once it hit some hair though.</li>
            <li> It worked for one week. Now, ONLY the light works. Am I supposed to use it as a flashlight? It&#x27;s a piece of junk. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME &amp; MONEY.</li>
            <li> This gadget actually performs as advertised on TV, but it takes some getting used to working it. Hair is removed with slight tug which is felt. Clearing a hairy area in a dry mode is probably the best use of it.</li>
            <li> I purchased from a different outlet,  but felt the negative reviews are a little unfair. Is this a daily use product that competes with much more expensive trimmers,  no. Is it a solid little unit for light duty trimming nose,  ear,  and misc body hair,  yes. I bought it to keep in my travel bag for when I realize I have not tended to regular hair control,  and it works great. Would I try to shave all of my pubic area,  or a full beard,  no,  but that is not its stated purpose.  It is a trimmer,  not a shaver. Meant to shorten hair,  not make you wax level smooth. For the price it is a solid  performer for any road warriors that want the audience&#x27;s  rapt attention,  and not because your nose hair is dancing to it own tune.</li>
            <li> poor on/off switch, flimsy ,does not cut well</li>
            <li> I was very happy with the original MicroTouch But this new MicroTouch Max is useless the 2 I purchased did not cut anything I&#x27;m wondering if they are even made by the same company.</li>
            <li> i had used the old micro touch trimmer for years and it was great.  when it finally died i got the microtouch max.  what a mistake.  a complete waste of money.  it worked once and then NEVER AGAIN.  it is not worth buying and if it weren&#x27;t such a pain to return i would!!!  DON&#x27;T BUY THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> Purchased Microtouch Max at a local Walgreens and excitedly  I couldn&#x27;t wait to get home and try it.  But to my dismay the product&#x27;s on and off switch would not work properly.  First, it wouldn&#x27;t come on then once I got it turned on I couldn&#x27;t get it turned off until I removed the battery.  Not a good product.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with this one. It is not what the older ones used to be. I have had 2 other ones from the same company and they were much sharper and stronger. Switch is cheap. It has no power and replacing batteries doesn&#x27;t help. It pulls instead of cutting hair. I finally threw it out. Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS VERY HANDY FOR PAINLESS SHAVES.</li>
            <li> What a piece of Gar-Bage...absolutely worthless...zero power.  If it were free it would still be a piece of crap...save your money...</li>
            <li> I bought this as a stocking stuffer for my fiance and also my brother. It is very useful for trimming and shaping the haircut on the back of his neck, since he cuts his own hair. I know my brother enjoys it for trimming his goatee. Great stocking stuffer or small gift.</li>
            <li> My husband loves it. Just wishes it came with batteries. Happy he used it and had a good result. Lalala</li>
            <li> I saw this product on TV and ordered it online. The power switch stopped working after just 4 usage.    I would not recomend this product.</li>
            <li> The trimmer works just fine, but with the light on[[ASIN:B003ZW9LOQ Micro Touch Max Hair Remover]], batteries burn out too fast. My old trimmer works just as good if not better.</li>
            <li> My new trimmer broke down after only two weeks of use!!!  Very disapointed!!! Would not recommend this to anyone!!!  You can buy one for ten bucks at walmart that is just as good/bad!</li>
            <li> I had problems with this right out of the box.  The product is very very cheap and the switch is fragile.  The light does not work.  Save your money and stay away from this product!</li>
            <li> Picked this up for around eight bucks a couple weeks ago.  The moment I took it out of the packaging I could feel that it was made on the cheap, i.e. feels like its hollow and nothing&#x27;s inside.  I chose this over a phillips trimmer mainly cus of the price and I had already a beard/mustache trimmer and I just wanted something for touch ups so I went with this doodad.    I can agree when people say that even with a new battery this device doesnt pack a punch.  I&#x27;ve also discovered that on spots where there&#x27;s a good patch of hair it will jam up and stop working.  Don&#x27;t know if they all do that but its pretty annoying.    To conclude on a positive note, it is cheap and it does trim. So be aware with what you&#x27;re getting when looking at this, if youre looking for something you really want to have for a while and has a bit more oomph to it do look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> works as stated easy to handle,it&#x27;s not cumbersum to handle the light sure helps when doing the ears,worth the money. First one did not work company replaced with no problum.</li>
            <li> Great item. Can&#x27;t complain really because it works great and it came on time. However, it&#x27;s $5 cheaper at ROSS I found out so I&#x27;m pretty bummed out.</li>
            <li> I probably wasn&#x27;t expecting much with this shaver. It came on time and in perfect condition, it just wasn&#x27;t of a very good quality.</li>
            <li> I owned a similar, but less &amp;#34;fancy&amp;#34; model of a personal grooming tool and this new one is much nicer and works better. The light works well so far and I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> I would like to review this product ,but unfortunately never received it . have had no satisfaction as to whereabouts</li>
            <li> Item does a fair job of removing hair.  It&#x27;s compact enough to reach in hard to reach areas.  Not bad for the price.  Easier to use and safer than a pair of scissors.</li>
            <li> No star for this miserable piece. It lasts less than a week, falls apart when you change the battery and clean the head... awful!</li>
            <li> Cheap piece of junk. Very weak motor, never really worked very well. Stopped working after a few months.  Put in a fresh battery, cleaned the terminals, etc.  Nada.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I subsequently bought a much better one here on Amazon manufactured by ToiletTree Products.  This one works like a charm - powerful motor, excellent blades, solid construction. I should have bought that one in the first place!  Well, you live and you learn.</li>
            <li> First and foremost the light on it does not work. Second it is very cheaply made. I would have gladly paid more for a better product. Disappointed is the word I would use.</li>
            <li> The thing is horrible. Does not work half as good as they make it look. I would never buy one again.</li>
            <li> I bought this for  $3, I wasn&#x27;t expecting much. This thing is extremely low powered and hardly works. It didn&#x27;t come with a battery, which is fine for the price. Switching to the on position doesn&#x27;t always work; you have to toggle it a few times before it turns on. I bought this solely for trimming my eyebrows, which is probably the most it could handle anyways. It kind of works, but it&#x27;s very weak and too much hair will make it turn off. I had to pass by about ten times each brow for it to get the results I was satisfied with. It trimmed one brow fine, but the other was left with a patch that looked like singed hairs. The quality of the trimmer itself is very cheap. I actually broke off a little plastic part on the attachment trying to snap it into the trimmer. Overall, for $3, I&#x27;m happy that it does something, but I wouldn&#x27;t pay $1 more. Sipping was much faster than I expected, so that was a big plus. (I purchased this off the Wish App, btw).</li>
            <li> its a decent little unit, works ok. I guess for the money its alright, the led light is annoying but doesn&#x27;t affect the performance of the unit</li>
            <li> This is the MOST worthless item I have ever purchased.  The motor has only worked a few times.  I have changed the battery and still get the same results...frustration.  I am attempting to determine how I can get a full refund so at least then I will only be out the time I have wasted attempting to get the Micro Touch Max Hair Remover working.</li>
            <li> Works fine.  I have had several over the years. They last for a couple of years till the blades get worn.</li>
            <li> I used finishing touch prior which I liked mostly lasted a good 3 years.  Looking for something new I came upon this.  The first time I used it for 4 minutes for my nose hairs I turned it off and was pleased.  About a week or so later I went to use it again for the 2nd time and the power did not work-yet the light still worked.  I replaced it thinking it was the battery no such luck still did not work.  I thought maybe I just got a bad egg, but after reviewing the absurd amount of one star reviews clearly they are all made junky.  This is truly a disgrace of a company, no matter how cheap they are.  Shame on you Microtouch ...they should be sued for such malproduction.  Talk about robbing the public blind.  I&#x27;d rate it lower if I could.</li>
            <li> Cheap, flimsy, &amp; weak!!! Pulls the hair out more than it cuts! Worst trimmer I&#x27;ve ever bought. I&#x27;ve had cheaper that was better made. Don&#x27;t waste your money like I did!!</li>
            <li> not sellers  fault but it didn&#x27;t even turn on just the light worked. wow save your money I rolled the dice and lost maybe next time !</li>
            <li> Good product for grooming tasks</li>
            <li> Bought this product and worked great, for about 3 weeks.  Took it apart, seems to be a motor connection.  Instead of repair, bought another and it too died within few days.  Done with trying any further.</li>
            <li> Good luck on anything other than a prepubescent&#x27;s peach fuzz.  The actual trimmer is cheap and the motor is pathetic, It&#x27;s a really dumb product.</li>
            <li> Having tried what was supposed to be a better-quality trimmer made by Norelco, and found that it didn&#x27;t cut hair nearly as well as the MicroTouch, I made another purchase of the latter (my third in the last 6 years) and am very glad that I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many complain that the MicroTouch mechanism wears out sometime after one to three years of use. Well, indeed it does -- but then, how long does a straight-edge razor last? About the equivalent length of time, at most? So, why should anyone be surprised that a device costing only $10 would last any longer?&#x27;&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The point to bear in mind is that for the length of time that the MicroTouch works, it works extremely well, shaving hair closely but safely. In my experience, the same cannot be said for the Norelco NT9110 (the model that I tried and abandoned after one use); and from what I&#x27;ve read, none of the other devices in this category perform any, if at all, better. The Micro Touch is the exception, and if I have to replace it every 1 to 3 years, then so be it. At least during the product&#x27;s lifetime, it works the way it should.</li>
            <li> I was pleased with the micro touch hair remover for the first 4 weeks. It removed ear, nose and trimmed eye brow hair with ease. It did struggle with more course hair like the neck and side burns. Eventually all good things must come to an end! After around 3 weeks the light stopped working even with a new battery. Then the blades quickly became dull and started to pull hair instead of cut. Its a great product but for a limited time. So I suggest purchasing more than one at a time or go with a higher priced more durable solution.</li>
            <li> Not super sturdy, but works wonderfully for the price. If it starts working annoyingly slowly, just be sure to try replacing the batteries.</li>
            <li> I tested the [[ASIN:B003ZW9LOQ Micro Touch Max Hair Remover]] over the last day or so as a touch up trimmer.  Setup is simple, insert the included AAA battery inside and rotate the bottom to power on the unit.  I used the trimmer for my side burns and neckline on the back to keep my haircut looking managed.  For these uses I found the trimmer to perform really well; did a nice job keeping an even line and removing only as much hair as I aimed it to do.  I do not have facial hair, so I can&#x27;t comment on that use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer features an LED light, great for tough to see areas.  The package includes a comb attachment you can use for well-groomed facial hair.  Great for taming unruly eye brows.  The trimmer would be great for removing hair in your ear or nose, especially if it is a problem for you.  Small compact size makes it great for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like this trimmer.  I have found it to perform really well, and be a great maintenance tool.  Great for men, I would consider this a really good gift for dad, son, or any male in your life you would like to keep well groomed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Sample Provided For Review]</li>
            <li> Great product.  Good for nose, ears, sideburns etc.. whole family want one...reasonable price even has a light. Happy with item and purchased more.  No complaints whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I was curious about the functionality of this product.  It did not disappoint. I would highly recommend this to others.</li>
            <li> im very late with this rating but the prduct is good i had one before i bought this one that worked great this one broke within a month thou and i just always kept forgetting to write this review</li>
            <li> Excellent product &amp; very easy to use. Women, this is a nice gift to give your man. No shaving creme needed; no nicks; &amp; no blood. Your WHITE T-SHIRT from start to finish. Enjoy!</li>
            <li> Great Product, Excellent seller.</li>
            <li> This little contraption does not shave a hair on my body. In fact, it pulled a few hairs out of my mustache. I do not recommend this item. You&#x27;re better off using your normal Beard Trimmer.</li>
            <li> Not sure how this product made it to the stores. Basically a piece of junk that when you can get it to turn on it barely trims any hair at all. Do not waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> My Micro Touch Max Hair Remover arrived with a very nice zippered storage case and several accessories. Two AAA batteries are included, one is a spare. I uploaded a photo of the case w/accessories...you can see it in customer images. The accessories look nice, but I don&#x27;t expect them to last long. So far the only extra accessory used was the lint brush which works great. Just be careful, the handle will break easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Micro Touch was tested by two family members.&lt;br /&gt;One family member was brave &amp; used it on his nose hairs. The Micro Touch Max was used just inside the nostril. It took a few tries, but the Micro Touch effectively shaved that area.&lt;br /&gt;Both family members selected one of the 3 comb sizes to trim their eyebrows. The Micro Touch trimmed the long, bushy eyebrows, but didn&#x27;t work on shorter eyebrows. The Micro Touch removed chin hair, but didn&#x27;t shave closely enough &amp; left a longer stubble than was acceptable. The trimmer doesn&#x27;t seem overly powerful. The LED light is nice, but doesn&#x27;t light up the correct area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the Micro Touch, the family members decided it was OK and rated it at 3 stars. However, the next time it was turned on, it wouldn&#x27;t start. After removing the battery a few times, messing with on/off switch &amp; other tinkering around, we finally got it working again. This problem caused a one star deduction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;review sample provided</li>
            <li> never worked from the time I receved it  This is a poor quality product and I would not purchase it again</li>
            <li> I first bought this about 10 years ago, if you don&#x27;t have one of these you need it, it&#x27;s extremely handy and does the job what else can you say</li>
            <li> I use this for trimming nose hair (primarily) and i find it does a better job than the rotary nose hair clippers.&lt;br /&gt;Once a week and it keeps everything very neat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does have a flimsy cheap feel - however i have 4 or 5 of these laying around (some for travel) and i have never had one quit working yet. It&#x27;s nice to keep one in each bathroom and a couple in travel kits.</li>
            <li> POS never worked. Came with a Chinese battery that didn&#x27;t work. Back to using tweezers for nose hairs!</li>
            <li> Had one before and liked it.&lt;br /&gt;Does a great job in trimming hair and lasts a long time. I would recommend it!</li>
            <li> Piece of junk! I don&#x27;t know what else to say. Service from Amazon was fine. Product - not so much. Waste of money, but fortunately a small investment. I knew better, but thought it might be worth a try. Don&#x27;t bother. I only gave 1 star because that was the lowest option.</li>
            <li> The Micro Touch Max Trimmer seems to work pretty good. This was my second time ordering the same trimmer, because the other one that I ordered the first time and received didn&#x27;t work properly. My first trimmer would work once I had it on the &amp;#34;ON&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Light&amp;#34; setting, but the blade cutters wouldn&#x27;t cut pieces of my hairs properly whenever I would put the trimmer directly on my facial and bodily hairs. I ended up wasting money on my first trimmer even though it was pretty inexpensive. I then ordered a Micro Touch Max Trimmer for the second time and didn&#x27;t have as much trouble than the first one. The blade cutters were working and cutting some my hairs pretty well, but not 100% precise cutting. My second trimmer still needed some improvements, especially with a very precise cutting blade. This second trimmer is still okay though. I don&#x27;t know if I would recommend this product to anyone though, because I noticed that most people experience a lot of problems with this type of product, especially when it&#x27;s not working properly in good condition or when it&#x27;s becoming obsolete. Everyone whoever buys this product should be careful, because it might not work well as expected.</li>
            <li> Micro Touch Max Hair Remover is great when it works.  Very seldom does one of mine last more than a month or two.  It&#x27;s a piece of junk that needs improvement.  Again, it&#x27;s a good product, but doesn&#x27;t last very long.  I usually have to buy a few at a time in order to have it when I need it.  Very unreliable.</li>
            <li> Not only was this my second attempt at this product, each of them broke after about 3 weeks. If ever Einstein&#x27;s theory of insanity were applicable, it is here; after all, I bought this a second time, expecting different results.</li>
            <li> After purchasing this product, its does not do well as it claims.  The power is not strong and I rather use a razor blade than waste my money on this crap product.</li>
            <li> For years, I&#x27;ve used the women&#x27;s version of this product in all different brands. Usually, they come with the hair remover and a couple of guide combs and maybe a tiny brush for cleaning the hair remover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This kit comes with so much more. I&#x27;m surprised it&#x27;s not at all listed in the description.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;INCLUDED:&lt;br /&gt;* two AAA batteries&lt;br /&gt;* double headed comb guide (2 mm and 4 mm)&lt;br /&gt;* single headed comb guide (6 mm)&lt;br /&gt;* cleaning brush (to clean the MicroTouch)&lt;br /&gt; * zippered case&lt;br /&gt; * toenail clipper&lt;br /&gt; * shoehorn&lt;br /&gt; * fingernail clipper&lt;br /&gt; * lint brush&lt;br /&gt; * nail file&lt;br /&gt; * tweezers&lt;br /&gt; * hair comb&lt;br /&gt; * travel toothbrush in toothbrush case&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything is great with the exception of the tweezers. They are ultra-cheap tweezers that don&#x27;t work any better than if I used my fingernails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the hair remover on my brows along with the guide comb to trim them so they&#x27;re less bushy. It trims just as well as the women&#x27;s hair removers. There&#x27;s a light on the MicroTouch that that I keep off because it would otherwise shine in my eyes. That&#x27;s better for other parts of the body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a fantastic set. I should have switched to the men&#x27;s kit years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was provided for review by Interact Marketing.</li>
            <li> And it is not quality made.  But it is not expensive either, and it comes with a \\&quot;free\\&quot; personal care zippered case loaded with all kinds of goodies:  Clippers, comb, file, toothbrush, tweezers, lint remover and shoe horn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not trim as closely as a razor:  I needed to make two, three passes to trim closely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the light!  It really helps me see how well a job it is doing--or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a cleaning brush and three height adjustments.  It also comes with two batteries--one for reserve, because it only needs one AAA to power it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will have better luck re-assembling this little gadget when you realize that there is a dot on the inside battery holder that corresponds with the dot on the outside base case.  Line up the two dots and things will fit tightly.  If you don&#x27;t line them up exactly, the base won&#x27;t fit tight and the movable silver ring that turns the trimmer on and off won&#x27;t work properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In case you are having the same thoughts I did:  I thought it might work for other jobs besides personal grooming.  No, it does not, and I cannot fault the gadget for not doing something it never claimed to do:  I tried it to remove pulls and nubs on material.  No.  I tried it on our tiny schnauzer on the area around his eyebrows.  No, his hair was either too thick or too fine, I don&#x27;t know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received a sample product from Interact Marketing.</li>
            <li> Not easy to use as it looks on tv. I have no idea how one would remove all the hair on a mans chest; I have difficulty removing eyebrow hair. Difficult to be precise &amp; it doesn&#x27;t seem to work at all w the combs included. Maybe it just need better directions, but I don&#x27;t get it...</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work, it&#x27;s cheap and it&#x27;s not even worth it</li>
            <li> I see that this thing has a ton of bad reviews here, and that the blades don&#x27;t work for some, the battery for others, etc. The company sent me a unit to review, and it too has the issue of the motor slowing down and speeding up a bit when the battery is not just so in its compartment. But once I fiddle with it a bit, it works fine, and the blades work well, cutting small hairs fast and cleanly. I have a good Panasonic ear and nose hair trimmer which works well, but it has a conical top which hides the blades, so it&#x27;s not very good at stray eyebrow hairs or the edge of an ear. Which is where this little thing excels; because the tiny blades are exposed, you can cut within millimeters of where you want it, so it&#x27;s great for eyebrows and ear hair, the only thing I need it for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it a poorly made piece of plastic? Yes.&lt;br /&gt;Does it work perfectly every time? No.&lt;br /&gt;Does it do what I want it to, almost all the time? Yes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not a glowing review, right? So why the fours stars? Because I review things above all for their value: performance vs price. And while this would be a total ripoff at its SRP of 30 bucks, it is now 6 and change here, and that is exactly what I think it&#x27;s worth. If it doesn&#x27;t work, get your money back. But if it does, then you&#x27;re getting a service well worth six bucks, especially if you have unruly hairs declaring war on your ears and eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They sure could have made this better, but for six bucks it&#x27;s a fair deal. That&#x27;s a cup of coffee these days! So, if you need those pesky little hairs trimmed and don&#x27;t mind throwing the dice that you&#x27;ll get a good unit, give this a try. You can always return it. And if it works, it&#x27;s actually a pretty good deal. And please note, it does work for lots of people. It&#x27;s like going to Vegas, for only six bucks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll say this for Idea Village: they know that if you&#x27;re going to sell cheap stuff, you need to sell it cheap.  And seeing as this works well enough for me, I&#x27;d recommend it, with the previous proviso.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And hey: it was Seen On TV, and why wouldn&#x27;t you trust your TV?commend it, with the previous proviso.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And hey: it was Seen On TV, and why wouldn&#x27;t you trust your TV?</li>
            <li> Got the thing and it didn&#x27;t work plus it feels really low quality even for something that is just 10 bucks.</li>
            <li> This trimmer met all my needs, great at trimming nose hair, ear hair, loved it.  So disappointed that it stopped working after two weeks, totally died, changed the battery, and cleaned it inside and out. threw it in the trash as it would cost more to send it back then its worth. shame on you Micro Touch Max Hair Remover, your product doesn&#x27;t stand up.</li>
            <li> Works okay on ordinary basis, but not very well with different applications, and unfortunately one function (light) does´nt work on both items bought</li>
            <li> This is a decent little trimmer for limited use (small areas of hair where another trimmer might be too large, too likely to cut you, or too inaccurate). Cutting too much hair at once with this trimmer may be too much for it, but that&#x27;s not the intended usage. It&#x27;s only powered by one AAA battery so its cutting power is limited. You still have to be careful though, or you could still cut yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest downside is probably the build quality. It is cheaply made, which is why I would recommend something more expensive if you will be using it a lot or if you have large areas of hair that need trimming... but even if you do have a larger trimmer, this can still come in handy for situations and areas where a larger &amp; more powerful trimmer won&#x27;t work as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product comes with a 1 year warranty but you&#x27;ll have to ship it to them in CA with proof of purchase and $7.99 for return postage &amp; handling, so if it breaks then it would probably be cheaper and easier to just buy another unit since these aren&#x27;t expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall 3 stars for what it is. The major downside is the build quality but for the price I can&#x27;t complain much. It works well enough for the situations mentioned above... just don&#x27;t expect $30+ build quality at this price and don&#x27;t expect it to do miracles or to have a lot of power and you probably won&#x27;t be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: I was sent a free product sample for review.</li>
            <li> POWER LESS.  DOES NOT CUT HAIR AS ADVERTISED.  OLD ONE I HAVE WAS BETTER....LIGHT DOES NOT WORK AT ALL.  .</li>
            <li> The Micro Max worked great three times. First the light went out. Now it only works sometimes. The battery cover falls off. So that could be the problem or maybe the switch. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> The commercial did not deceive. The shave is close. The light is great as an added feature and I can take it anywhere I want.</li>
            <li> No. No. No. I was very disappointed in this product. It did nothing it was advertised to day. It never worked and was a waste of my time and money.</li>
            <li> I received this Micro Touch Max trimmer in exchange for my honest review. I am very glad I didn&#x27;t pay for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is very cheaply made and does not work well. The on-off-light switch only works part of the time. I had to keep jiggling it to keep the trimmer running. It worked fairly well on nasal hair but once I added the mini combs, it didn&#x27;t work at all. I tried to trim my husband&#x27;s neck hair - no luck - and no luck on trimming my eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a [[ASIN:B0049LUI9O Panasonic ER-GN30-K Nose, Ear &amp; Facial Hair Trimmer Wet/Dry with Vortex Cleaning System]] a few months ago that works MUCH better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nifty little travel case that came with my sample is worth much more than the trimmer and I DON&#x27;T think it comes with the trimmer on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with the seller&#x27;s handling of my order, however, the quality of the product is somewhat less than I had hoped for. But that&#x27;s the way it is with many products we consumers buy these days, what with so many being made outside the USA.</li>
            <li> i see that the catridge doesn&#x27;t work as expected</li>
            <li> Works great and price rocks!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Had one in the past for years and these are the same.  Much better than the other brands&lt;br /&gt;for quick neck, sideburns and even eyebrows.  Getting 2 at this price is great.&lt;br /&gt;Just what we wanted and very pleased!&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU VENDOR AND AMAZON !!</li>
            <li> poorly constructed and does not work that well.</li>
            <li> i got this for my nose hairs and it works great for what i need and it arrived about two weeks after ordering from china i wish i would have known it was from china when i ordered it but oh well</li>
            <li> just really cheaply made. didn&#x27;t last long. batteries kept disconnecting (had to turn it on and off several times to get it to work!)</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure it would work as advertised but very surprised it did. The extra attachments it comes with are good for different areas for hair removal.  Easy to use and small enough to take as a travel item.</li>
            <li> Not a good product. For $10 bucks what&#x27;d I expect?  The only thing this item did was pull the hair out of my nostels.  The Micro Touch has found it&#x27;s new home in the bottom of my tool box to be used maybe as a door stop.</li>
            <li> I should have read the reviews on this product.  Limited use. Not very effective at cutting hair. I looked at the TV ads instead of reading the reviews.</li>
            <li> I bought this product thinking it was as powerful as regular clippers but it&#x27;s not. it does get the job done for me but it took too long.</li>
            <li> cheap broke after a few times i used it..</li>
            <li> Got an immediate refund</li>
            <li> Nothing like the commercial.</li>
            <li> To be honest it doesn&#x27;t work as great as it looks on tv. I&#x27;d rather spend more money and buy a better one</li>
            <li> Not a good product. Cuts ok but the light doesn&#x27;t work. Expected a little better shaver. You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Not worth returning but poorly made (in China), nonfunctional light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also no case, no battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t see better products, so I&#x27;ll live with it.</li>
            <li> Works ok, but light did not work and could perform better</li>
            <li> Battery goes dead in less then 2mins. Using duracell AAA battery cheap waste of money.and did not get a free battery w/mine,uses 1battery.</li>
            <li> Have tried 2 now and both had lights that do not work.  Without a light you cannot see what you&#x27;re doing.</li>
            <li> Nice product. Great for shaving armpit, nose and body hairs</li>
            <li> This thing runs so very slowly that you can almost count the revolutions of the uneven motor. It only deserves 1 star because it hasn&#x27;t pulled at my nose hair. It will cut eventually. I don&#x27;t have the patience for it though. I&#x27;m ordering a different brand today.</li>
            <li> Terrible. Blade is extremely weak can barely cut facial hair. Plus the product came in bubble wrap so can&#x27;t even tell if it&#x27;s new. Definitely wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> The Micro Touch Max Hair Remover is an inexpensive option to the pricey trimmers out in the market. This particular model is intended to be used occasionally because it is made out of plastic parts and will not survive constant daily use. Does come with 2 convenient comb attachments for trimming eyebrows or mustache hairs. The shaver can be used to remove facial hair, ear and to nose hairs! My husband used it to trim his neck and sideburns and it worked well, but it did not do much for his arm hairs which he likes to keep shaved because he is a mechanic and they are constantly burning off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Takes one AAA battery but two batteries are included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A zippered travel bag case is also included that has an area for your Micro Touch Hair Remover and attachments, and it also includes two different sized nail trimmers, shoe horn, comb, toothbrush, tweezers, nail file and a lint remover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Micro Touch Hair Remover does have a one year warranty, but you have to include $7.99 for shipping and handling. I guess for that price you might as well buy another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for review.</li>
            <li> The unit is suppose to have a light but the light does not work. As far as the hair remover part it works as advertised.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver to use to take care of &amp;#34;five o&#x27;clock&amp;#34; shadow.  It does the job excellently, It&#x27;s size is excellent as I can take it the car and use it before going into my affair. Would recommend</li>
            <li> A cheep piece of junk not worth any where near the price, if they sold it for a dime it would be over priced!!</li>
            <li> It worked the first time I turned it on then wouldn&#x27;t come on. I took battery out, played with and cleaned it. Got it to come on but doesn&#x27;t work without shaking or turning on and off numerous times. I thought it would work more than once! Didn&#x27;t save packaging or would have returned it, do like it when it works though - thanks anyway!</li>
            <li> I bought this product and thought it was going to be great, well, I didn&#x27;t even get to use it. I opened it up and right when I inserted the batteries it literally broke apart in my hands, this is a poorly made product. DO NOT BUY THIS PRRODUCT!</li>
            <li> This is ideal for cutting your pesky pubic hair. I bought it to trim mustache hairs, but I noticed that my pubes needed a touch up as well. I didn&#x27;t know how it&#x27;d do, but this lil guy took like two minutes and was the cleanest shave I&#x27;ve ever had down there.</li>
            <li> bladebroke first time I used it bad choice on my part for buying woud suggest not to buy this product John Crawford</li>
            <li> product arrived on time and are very good, a responsible person is recommended.</li>
            <li> Bought the &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; (underpowered) one a few years ago and it worked, sorta, on and off.... when it worked, it did a fair job. Then it just stopped working. I saw the &amp;#34;new and improved&amp;#34; one at Wal-Mart and figured that they had improved the quality and power. No such luck... I got taken in again (shame on me). It worked once or twice and after a month or two it went completely dead. I am hunting for the receipt to take back to Wal-Mart to see if they will take this back. I wouldn&#x27;t even give it one star. Better off looking at a Norelco and/or a Wahl.... You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product to replace a previous one of same name and design that I physically bought at a retail store that worked great for a long time and just got worn out. This is different than the first one. First of all, the picture shows this product in the package. I received it with no packaging and it looked dissimilar and it started to come apart immediately. Light never worked, product falls apart around the blade area. When physically comparing the two  this version is much cheaper and I would go as far as to say that I think it is fake. Not worth a penny, definitely not $5!</li>
            <li> Did not trim at all. Would not cut hairs, was very cheap and broke after about 3 minutes of use.</li>
            <li> product was effective enough when it worked. i did have minor issues with the switch since day one. now it has 100% failed after about a month of ownership    when i read in the directions not to use in a moist environment, i knew i had made a mistake in purchasing this product    i&#x27;ve had a remington wet/dry for years with no problems</li>
            <li> As mentioned by others - this trimmer works faster and more effectively than any other I&#x27;ve used.  Only 4 stars because the led light didn&#x27;t work on mine.  Otherwise, the build seems a little better than others have indicated.</li>
            <li> product is very fragile, its feels like it will fall apart anytime.  it does cut you if you are not careful.</li>
            <li> This may be the worst product I have ever purchased. Not worth one penny. It is cheap, cheesy and completely useless.</li>
            <li> Worked great when I first received. After one time of use, it acted as if the battery required changing.&lt;br /&gt;I turned it upside down, etc. and then it started running steady then would stop.  I changed battery, and&lt;br /&gt;still would not run properly.  I tapped it, and it started working, then would stop.  No matter what was tried,&lt;br /&gt;this little gadget just didn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;What a waste of money and would not recommend</li>
            <li> Had the old model before and liked it, but the improved model is far superior.  It even lets you change a battery whaich the old model did not.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had two of these and both quit working after the first time. Such a waste of money!</li>
            <li> I purchased Micro Touch Max Hair Remover for personal grooming.  This product removes unwanted hairs in/on the human body.  Often hair grows in the strangest of places; ie, ears and nose.  Micro Touch is small enough to maneuver in tight spaces.  It is quick and easy to use for unwanted hairs.  It can also be used on much larger hair surfaces.  I saw this product on TV but was reluctant.  Once I saw it on Amazon, I knew that I could trust the seller and site.</li>
            <li> Good stuff... my second order of this product. Would buy again if a replacement was needed.</li>
            <li> Only gave it four stars due to the battery compartment doesn&#x27;t hold the battery tight enough. The operation of the trimmer goes up and down and I have to shake the trimmer a little to get it to run higher.</li>
            <li> I bought this item as a gift to a friend who jokingly said he wanted one, so I for a laugh or two bought this item and we all had a good laugh about it</li>
            <li> Very poorly made and very underpowered!</li>
            <li> Very, very slow. You could do better with scissors or a real trimmer. As seen on TV isn&#x27;t worth the money.</li>
            <li> I bought the trimmer for ear hair, which it does a great job on. Razors only cut this sensitive area. That said, it is not as \\&quot;safe to the touch\\&quot; as the ads claim. I tried it on nose hair and got a nasty nick on the inside of my nose. I \\&quot;spot tested\\&quot; the trimmer on my leg hair before trying it out. It&#x27;s capable of taking off a good amount of hair. I don&#x27;t see it working in the back area, but if you have some other hair removal project, or someone to help you reach difficult to reach areas (like the back), I suppose it would work. All in all, I would say this is an average trimmer. If you have an existing tool, I would just stick with that. This trimmer won&#x27;t do anything your basic Norelco (and similar) model won&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I previously purchased one of these by Panasonic years ago and love it.  Thought I would try this as my old blade is getting dull (this is after 15-20 years).  The Micro Touch does not even remove any hair.  I am very disappointed.  I have gone back to using my Panasonic.  I will admit that having the light in the Micro Touch was something I was looking forward to and it does work-but what good is it to have the light shine on hair that isn&#x27;t being removed-</li>
            <li> This is a great hair trimmer. I&#x27;ve been using the microtouch max hair trimmer for about 3 weeks now and find it so convenient. I&#x27;ve used other hair trimmers in the past and none compare to my microtouch max. I wanted to give a microtouch max review so I can let people know how great they product is from a happy customer. It didn&#x27;t take long at all for my microtouch max trimmer to be delivered to my home. I bought it mainly to trim my nose hairs and the hair on my neck. I was quite surprised to find out that his hair trimmer has a built in light which I didn&#x27;t even notice in the infomercial. You can&#x27;t find this trimmer in any stores. [[ASIN:B003ZW9LOQ Micro Touch Max Hair Remover]]</li>
            <li> Micro Touch Max hair remover is perfect for what I want it for . It cut hair very well for me. Glad I bought it &amp; the price was great.</li>
            <li> Best nose-hair trimmer ever...and now there is a light so you can see your nose hairs before they are cut...wow!</li>
            <li> *Disclosure: I was contacted by a representative for IdeaVillage and given a sample of this product specifically for the purpose of giving my thoughts on it.*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re not familiar with infomercials and their tendency for making big claims with poor acting, then you must not have a TV.  If you have, then you have probably wondered just how well those products really work.  I know I have, over and over again.  Today, we have one such, the Micro Touch Max.  Here on Amazon, IdeaVillage is keeping the claims to...nothing.  As of this writing, the product page is very sparse on details.  Over on the product&#x27;s web site, IdeaVillage more actively advertises the wonder of the Micro Touch Max.  So what are those claims?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.) \\&quot;Gets as close as a blade, yes it&#x27;s safe to touch.\\&quot;  - Well, safe to touch is accurate.  Laying and hold the edge of the cutters against my skin produced nothing but a small tingle, and that was from the vibration of the unit while in operation.  The close as a blade part?  If we&#x27;re talking razor blade, yeah no.  A definite amount of visible stubble.  Against a set of [[ASIN:B000JNQSIQ Wahl clippers]] or the [[ASIN:B004PXIR1W Conair GMT900 iStubble]], the Micro Touch Max is still a loser when it comes to closeness of the cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.) \\&quot;Use for neck/sideburns, eyebrows, ears, chest/back/shoulders, nose, arms/hands/fingers\\&quot; - Technically true, as it will work, but most of these you will need to follow up with a razor for a smooth finish.  Like using a weed whacker or brush hog to chop down the big stuff and then finishing with a mower.  The eyebrows are pretty ok, unless you&#x27;re trying to take them clean off.  The nose?  Yeah, not going to stick it up my nose. Really, it doesn&#x27;t seem to make sense to do so as the blades of the Micro Touch Max are at the wrong angle for that kind of work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.) \\&quot;Super bright light lets you see what you&#x27;re doing.\\&quot;  - There is a light, it does work, but the location of it is such that little to no illumination gets to the work site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, not so great on living up to what one might expect, based on the claims by IdeaVillage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How about the unit itself?  This is a tough one.  As of this writing the price is six bucks with free shipping, meaning that it&#x27;s cheap.  In a way that&#x27;s fitting, because the Micro Touch Max is cheaply made.  Three days in, and the cap no longer stays on.  The motor inside sounds weak and doesn&#x27;t run at a constant speed, even with fresh batteries and it not doing any work.  The switch mechanism sloppy with a fair amount of play that contributes to the motor sounding funky.  The unit comes apart for cleaning, and that&#x27;s fairly easy.  Getting it back together on the other hand can be tricky.  Given that it&#x27;s all plastic snaps, I&#x27;d not expect it will take long before the Micro Touch doesn&#x27;t want to stay put together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, if you&#x27;re willing to buy something cheap with the expectation that it&#x27;s not going to last too long, then the Micro Touch Max isn&#x27;t a bad choice for some general grooming.  If you&#x27;re looking for quality, you&#x27;re looking at the wrong product.e to no illumination gets to the work site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, not so great on living up to what one might expect, based on the claims by IdeaVillage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How about the unit itself?  This is a tough one.  As of this writing the price is six bucks with free shipping, meaning that it&#x27;s cheap.  In a way that&#x27;s fitting, because the Micro Touch Max is cheaply made.

            <li> I felt so bad because my husband was looking forward to this product and it barely even trimmed any of his facial hair.  He had to go over the same place like 5 times to finally get it.  After anticipating its arrival and talking about it so much, it never gets used and I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> One triple A battery, and it sounds like it.  The thing barely runs.  Feels like a cheap toy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works nowhere as well as they show on TV.  If you have one stray hair somewhere, it&#x27;ll cut that.  But that&#x27;s it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I threw the thing away after a month.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo3N9MGQLQ2K6KE]]Everything about the trimmer felt poorly made, just inserting the batteries and turning it on took multiple attempts. The trimmer came with two batteries, however I was only able to fit in one. Because the fit of the cover was sloppy I took the trimmer apart several times, thinking I must have not put it together correctly. The trimmer&#x27;s motor sounded underpowered. The blade is recessed so it is difficult to position it exactly where you want it. I own Panasonic Pivoting Head trimmer which I use to sculpt my \\&quot;sideburns\\&quot; in between hair appointments. Panasonic trimmer allows me to make them as cute looking as my hairdresser. I was not able to do this task with this trimmer. Recessed blade, the size of the blade, the angle of the blade, and under powered motor are possible contributors to the problems I encountered. What the trimmer managed to cut was not a close trim. The blade is fairly large and you would not recommend it for nose or ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this trimmer for testing and review from Idea Village. I always try to give an honest and fair review stating positive and negatives. Unfortunately, I was not able to find anything I liked about it. This trimmer does not feel well made and does not work well. I can&#x27;t recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ali Julia review</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made.  Lights hasn&#x27;t worked since I put batteries in it and it really dosnt work like the commercials show.  I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> Would buy another one.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and it really works great.I tried lot of trimmers and others hair remover,this is by far the most accurate and the easiest to handle.I&#x27;m planning to get more of it!</li>
            <li> This trimmer is great, works well to get rid of un-wanted hair - I use it all the time.</li>
            <li> Thing is a piece of junk!  Do not buy!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Cheap design. Cuts inside of nose easily and painfully. Stopped working with little use in 2 months. In the garbage. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Does the job well enough but difficult to always get it at the right angle when chasing hairs in your ears.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother.  Cheap, barely works, loose connections in battery compartment means the clipper speed is inconsistent.</li>
            <li> The product stopped working after only two months. I returned it and asked for a replacement. Here is what was written to meDear Valued Customer,       Thank you for your message. Your Micro Touch is covered by a 60 replacement guarantee. You also did not contact us to get return authorization. At this point due to the time frame, we are unable to replace the item for you. We apologize for the inconvenience. Thank you and ahve a great day!       Kind Regards,   Citlaly   Micro Touch Max Customer Service     The product comes with a 1 year warranty so Im not sure if they really know what there own warranty states. I liked the product when it worked it was great. Dont waste your money on this product though they will not back up their own workmanship which is very poor.</li>
            <li> I shop a LOT online. You name it I have and will buy that way. However in 10 years + of shopping this way it is only the 2nd time I shouldn&#x27;t have.  The \\&quot;motor\\&quot; is very weak. At first I thought it was the batteries. I tried 2 sets of brand new batteries...no improvement.  It pulls the hair and I attribute that to the slowness. The power, what there is comes and goes, but it is mostly gone.  My suggestion...pass this item by.</li>
            <li> The on-off switch did not work, remained in the \\&quot;on\\&quot; position. The only way to tutn it off was to take out the battery. In use was only marginally effective, did not cut close.</li>
            <li> Based on the TV commercials, I thought this product would be just the thing I needed for trimming nose and ear hair.  After ready the reviews, I DON\\&quot;T THINK SO.</li>
            <li> Tried it and it broke right away, I could not even trim a bit on my face. It was difficult to turn it on, I moved it to on but I guess it is loose so it wouldn&#x27;t turn on unless I press firmly while twisting it on. Whats bad about this product is that the product fell apart and cut me, dangerous. I don&#x27;t recommend anyone purchasing this product, its not safe. It also tugged onto my hair...</li>
            <li> badly constructed, flimsy, falling apart, the original was a much better product, almost junk 6 dmore words required eenough aleady</li>
            <li> Item arrived early, light on shaver has not functioned from the start.  Battery was dead or almost had to replace it.  It shaves.</li>
            <li> At first it looks like a good product.  There are several nice features, and it trimmed pretty effectively, BUT it broke after the second time I used it.  It couldn&#x27;t even power up.</li>
            <li> Listen to those that say,&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Don&#x27;t waste your money.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not and threw $5.50 in the garbage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a micro trimmer from &amp;#34;Nikai&amp;#34; for at least 10 years which I bought locally in a closeout store for a few dollars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That thing actually did work. The cutters cut, and were not &amp;#34;recessed&amp;#34; like this piece of junk, making it very difficult to even contact the hair adequately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Couple that with the fact that this thing has the head on a 15 degree angled AWAY from rest of the &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34;, and it becomes impossible to make any decent contact with the hair (whether sideburns neck hairs, etc.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I could find the Nikai again, I would buy it in a second.</li>
            <li> Bought it as a gift and the recipient was very satisfied with the product. Was nicely packaged as well. Great!</li>
            <li> This thing dont work, because dont cut my beard.....bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad, dont waste your money</li>
            <li> Not a quality product, but should not have high expectations for $10.  Spend a couple more dollars and get a better product from a local box store.</li>
            <li> worse trimmer I have ever bought. it has no power even with energizer batteries. its a joke and doesn&#x27;t cut like its supposed to. I wont recommend it to anybody</li>
            <li> The on/off switch broke after one time use and I am unable to fix it. Worked fine, great idea but the quality of the product needs to be better.</li>
            <li> A TV item, does as advertised, does not come with an aaa battery. works land does not cut skin.bad packaging, difficult to open.</li>
            <li> works well so far- at least it has lasted longer than other ones i have used.  perfectly fine and good.</li>
            <li> Mine lasted for a couple months, then unexpectedly the light stopped working even when i would change the batteries, and the shaver would be really weak depending on how i tilted it. Anyways, its not the best.</li>
            <li> Just thought the product was promoted better than it actually is. Not impressed at all with this it will probably be in the trash soon.</li>
            <li> Poorly designed did not do the job stated as advertised. would not suggest you buy this product. Poor form fit an function.</li>
            <li> I used this for less than 1 minute trimmer guard fell off went down sink now it is useless to use trimmer .</li>
            <li> It does what it promised to do. I use it occasionally, when see some &amp;#34;underbrush&amp;#34; :), and it works well, for various parts of my head. Local lighting is very helpful too.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product based on an infomercial and really feel taken. I got sucked into the so called deluxe model which I cannot locate on any web site including their own for $24.98 plus I was charged $17.97 shipping for a total of $42.95. I ordered at a time when the order was taken by electronic messages and there was not a chance to talk to a real person and further I was not able to determine the final cost. I called a day later and found out the true cost that was billed to my credit card and was not a happy camper. Having received it today, I realize why they ripped me for so much of a shipping charge. It insured them that I most likely would not return it as I would give up the $17.97 they charged to receive it plus I would have to pay the return shipping which I doubt would be more than $6. I could have purchased it from Amazon or other site for $9.50 and in some cases free shipping as I found out after receiving the Micro Touch Max. I thought this would be a good trimmer for vacations, but I tried it and with a days growth on my face, it would not cut it. It will cut fine hair but not as close as would be desired. I did not realize what was contained in the so called Delux Grooming Kit but the contents I already have, so it was a wasted add-on for Free but with $6.99 shipping and it is not worth more than the shipping charge. I have been taken and only wish I had read all the reviews before ordering and if I still remained stupid after doing so, I should have ordered form a sorce offering it for less money. I found the same deal I paid $24.98 for for 11.99 on line. I would not recommend this trimmer at any price and I doubt there is anything deluxe about the one I received which is supose to be twice as powerful os the one on the infomercial. Don&#x27;t get sucked into this unit. Based on the price and quality it is not worth more than half a star but that was not an option.</li>
            <li> Battery not included, contrary to instructions. Light did not work. Quality control?</li>
            <li> It does the job well but I have to take the battery out to turn it off.  If I had one that worked right I&#x27;d have rated it a 5.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews I decided not to purchase this item, it scared me.&lt;br /&gt;All I needed it for would be to trim my private area...&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to leave zero star, but had to put one in order to post this review.&lt;br /&gt;#JUSTSAYING</li>
            <li> I bought this product with the intention of using it once or twice till it broke; apparently my expectations were to high. Just putting the battery in this device made me feel like I broke something and I just might have considering the thing never worked with the battery provided. I regret ever buying this thing and I will try to get a refund!</li>
            <li> My husband loves it for his ears.</li>
            <li> this little charmer does an outstanding job but don&#x27;t expect it to last forever.</li>
            <li> I like it. Use good batteries for best results. Pretty good for the money. I like the adapters for length of hair, Eyebrows, to inside ears, and of course man-scapeing. Not itchy after trimming.</li>
            <li> The quality of this product is simply \\&quot;TERRIBLE\\&quot;. If someone gives you this product, don&#x27;t waste your time to get it to work.</li>
            <li> If you want to have hair on your arms or trim the hair on the back of your neck, I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Well i bought this not expecting a great deal since i had read a series of mixed reviews. Well i am here to tell you I like it. If you expect to do a complete haircut and sideburns trim this is not meant for that!! I does trim the nose hairs (without the dangerous aspect of having to insert sharp scissors into your nose and pray you don&#x27;t cut yourself) and ear hair. It will also trim small amounts of hair near the top of your ears in between cuts and can trim your eyebrows. You do have to experiment a bit to find out what works but is very effective for waht its meant for.</li>
            <li> An excellent product works like a dream does as advertised on the tv have no hesitation in recommending it to any one wanting to temporarily remove hair</li>
            <li> This thing is a piece of junk. The light did not work out of the box and it seems like it always takes a few seconds for it to get up to speed. When you do use it, it pulls on your hair. I threw it out and ended up buying an electric razor with grooming tools. This is just a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Unit works as advertised. Design provides for access where clipper models cannot reach. The unit was shipped very quickly also</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the worst!!! DO NOT BUY! PLEASE DO NOT BUY! DO NOT BUY! DO NOT BUY! DO NOT BUY! DO NOT BUY! DO NOT BUY!</li>
            <li> Junk.. Bring back the original..</li>
            <li> Works good. Shipped fast.</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money, very poorly made.</li>
            <li> It works as well as comb with a rusty blade. EPIC FAIL. It&#x27;s sharp, it hurts when pressed against the skin.</li>
            <li> Out of the box doesnt even turn on!!  Piece of junk &amp; a waste of money. Not even worth it to mail it back</li>
            <li> Amazon should hang its head in shame for even selling this piece of junk - it barely works at all, one would be better off cutting each tiny short hair one by one with a finger nail clipped than using this product</li>
            <li> Used it one time, doesn&#x27;t work second time I go to use it.  Light works but motor is dead.  JUNK</li>
            <li> excellent if it meets the expectations and good product delivered on time in my locker in miami, good seller, thanks</li>
            <li> It also does cause a pinch on your skin in sensitive areas. Not near as good of a tool as advertised.</li>
            <li> Sorry guys, they got you all.  I was watching this commercial and saw the tiny little thing falling apart and googled to see who really bought this and if there was an actual chance that my original claim was proven wrong.  I came to find that I was completely spot on and am sorry for all those who actually spent MONEY that was earned through tedious movemenets of your everyday life on this product that is now gently LAYING on your bathroom counter untouched and dissatisfied from the lack of contact along with the idea that it no longer attractive. Tough life.</li>
            <li> While this product does work after a fashion it definitely is not as fast and easy as they say. It works better if you use electric clippers first.</li>
            <li> Articulo llego en excelentes condiciones, 100% responsable y puntual en el proceso de entrega el cual finalizo con lo acordado</li>
            <li> Product did not work after 1 usage.&lt;br /&gt;It was hard just to turn as the switch was not working properely.&lt;br /&gt;It very cheaply put togather.&lt;br /&gt;The battery started heating up after usage making it a fire hazard.&lt;br /&gt;I request my money back.</li>
            <li> this trimmer is a redesign of the original 5 to 7 years ago, it doesn&#x27;t perform well in fact its a piece os junk, they should have left a good thing alone wouldn&#x27;t buy again</li>
            <li> Did not work ,will never work ,does NOT cut  ANY  hair. A cheap piece of trash, not as advertised,DO NOT BUY !!</li>
            <li> IT isnt the best hair remover Iv owned , Just ok.</li>
            <li> Received the item and it never worked.  I will return as I would rather the post office have my money rather than these venders of trash.</li>
            <li> This product did not meet my expectation at all, it is not practical, it is only a toy rather than a useful tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don not like anything about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anybody, no way</li>
            <li> What a piece of junk!  First off no battery; Then when new AAA battery was inserted it continued to fall out.  I placed thin paper around the battery to keep it in, then another 5 minutes trying to put the battery cap back on.  When turned on, the motor ran at varying speeds and the light flickered.  The next day the battery was dead...and yes I had turned it off.  A new battery failed to get it to run so I assumed the motor was kaput.  Never did get to use it.  I was so PO&#x27;ed I just threw the thing in the trash.  That machine should have been half as sturdy as the packaging which took about 6 minutes to remove...and still maintain 10 fingers.</li>
            <li> Hardly trims nose hair at all. Most nose hair trimmers have a removable head which can be washed; this doesn&#x27;t and is unsanitary because it cannot be washed. Piece of garbage (I&#x27;ve thrown it away.)    UPDATE: I also found that this works well for the eyebrows with the included attachment. However it is obviously poor quality and not worth buying.  Another thing is that mine (which I bought on eBay) said Microtouches Max rather than Microtouch Max. However the packaging and the unit looks identical to the Microtouch Max (which I have seen in the store) with the exception of the battery. It doesn&#x27;t seem to be a counterfeit.  Also, the [[ASIN:B000W405SG Philips NT9110]] is washable but is similar design to this one.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as I was looking for a detail trimmer for sideburns and eyebrows, and the adverts suggest that this is quite a powerful unit. How wrong and misleading this is. The unit is severely underpowered - which is especially a problem with hair trimming as it will have the tendency to drag hairs rather than giving a clean cut. If you slightly rotate the barrel you can hear the motor speeding up and slowing down, even with a brand new Duracell battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not attempt to use this for nasal hairs as the chance of dragging hair is just not worth the effort. I only really use this the odd stray eyebrow hair, which it manages (but surely that is the least you would expect from this product).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, if the product was £3 it would be about the right price, and only for very occasional use. All in all a cheap, overpriced and poorly made product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used and trashed two Remington trimmers after just a few uses so I decided to try a different brand.  I bought this one at a local drug store.  So far it seems more powerful and better made than the Remingtons.  I was very careful with the Remingtons.  I kept water away from them and rinsed the blades in alcohol and let them dry after each use.  No matter.... they both still died early deaths after just a few uses each.  This new model I&#x27;ve been just throwing into the drawer after use and so far it is ok.  It seems to have a strong motor.  I just paid $10 for it locally so I cannot comment on whether the mail order purchases are a rip off.</li>
            <li> PURE JUNK. BUY A QUART OF ICE CREAM INSTEAD. WAS HAPPY TO THROW IT IN THE GARBAGE. THEY SOMETIMES CAUSE TRAPPED HAIRS AND YOU END UP  WITH A SUBMERGED INFLAMMATION.</li>
            <li> I have been testing out the Micro Touch Max over the last few days and I think it works very well as a facial hair trimmer.  As a female, I find it works great for shaping and trimming my eyebrows.  It comes with combs which allow you to trim to different lengths.  I use one of the longer combs for trimming my eyebrows and go without a comb for shaping and eliminating wayward hairs.  For a man, I could see how the Micro Touch Max would be very useful for mustaches as well as eyebrows.  However, I would not recommend this product for removing large amounts of hairs, such as chest or leg hair.  This is really meant for smaller areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Setup of this product was easy - simply insert the included battery, close it up, and turn it on and you are ready to go.  It also comes with a light on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a good facial hair trimmer for the price.  However, if you need something more heavy duty or for larger areas, you are going to want to look elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for review.</li>
            <li> i thought i was buying a shaver, not a trimmer. this product leaves behind the most uncomfortable length of stuble</li>
            <li> gets done what i need it for</li>
            <li> In truth I thought was bringing more accessories. But then I think he will be helpful to my son But then I think he will be useful to my yerno.Gracias for your attention</li>
            <li> returned it - too weak and ineffective</li>
            <li> It was promptly mailed, and I immediately started to use it.&lt;br /&gt;It does an excellent job for the front nose hair, and hair on my ear lobes, but it does not work very well on the hair that are inside my nose towards the back of the nose.&lt;br /&gt;I think the front tip of the blade housing is preventing blade contact with the back nose hair.&lt;br /&gt;I did not have this problem with the original Micro Touch hair remover.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the package says battery included, but there was no battery.</li>
            <li> Works well but feels cheap</li>
            <li> I thought I reviewed this piece of junk already.  Maybe it just didn&#x27;t get approved... DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!  By the time I figured out that it wasn&#x27;t going to even start, it was broken!&lt;br /&gt;  The biggest rip-off I&#x27;ve ever seen.  I thought \\&quot;if it&#x27;s as bad as they say, Amazon would have removed it\\&quot;..  WRONG!!!</li>
            <li> broke after little use</li>
            <li> Junk!  The motor is way too weak and it doesn&#x27;t do what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  Find something else that works.</li>
            <li> On the plus side, this trimmer has never nicked or cut me.  On the minus side, it is barely capable of trimming any hair at all.&lt;br /&gt;When I first got it, I gingerly inserted it into a nostril and carefully turned it on.  I was pleasantly suprised that there was no pain, so I moved around a little.  You kind of have to cram it in because there is almost a 1/4 inch that projects above the cutting part.  But no hair got trimmed.  So I tried it again, this time more vigorously.  Nothing.  So I crammed it in past the point of comfort, and rubbed it in the thickest patch of nostril hairs.  And not a hair was cut.&lt;br /&gt; I have found that if I rub it the length of my hairy forearm about 4-5 times, it will cut about 3 hairs.  So I can&#x27;t say it doesn&#x27;t cut at all.  But it is useless as anything other than a weak vibrator/ flashlight combo.</li>
            <li> Got this in March and 3rd time using it, it broke. Save ur money or buy something else!</li>
            <li> Worst peace of plastic trash, promoted well, but don&#x27;t ever buy it!!!</li>
            <li> My husband is gonna love this gift.  Have tried several in the past, but have heard great reviews on this one.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. This thing is poor construction, poor engineering, poor quality, doesn&#x27;t work, don&#x27;t waste your time. This is a fare warning...... don&#x27;t spend money on this junk</li>
            <li> I bought this as I have short hair and wanted to be able to get my neck.  It rattles and the light goes off and on while trying to cut.  Also, it pulls the hair&#x27;s.  I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE.</li>
            <li> Received micro touch Max hair remover, place battery into receptacle. It started was turned off restart the next day. The next day it would not start, anyway try.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a cheap, quick way to remove facial hair and sideburns. For a mustache, you have to scrape it across your upper lip a couple hundred time just to get MOST of the hair off and for sideburns, it just plain doesn&#x27;t work. Also, the battery dies pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product but I think the handle is too big and the way the tip is angled is a little weird for me. If it was a straight tip it would make it more convenient for me</li>
            <li> Does not last very long. You can get about 3 good uses out of it before it starts to break down. Will not buy another one.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for.  It works as advertised, but after one successful use I had trouble trying to use it a second time.  Just for hoots, I tried to use it a minute ago -- it turns on, but it has to be in the \\&quot;Off\\&quot; position to work, and turned to the \\&quot;On\\&quot; position to power it off.  If I were in the market for a trimmer, I would pass this by and look for something with more quality.</li>
            <li> This  was a replacement for one that I gave to my grandson. He like the fact of the light incorporatedvto it. Very good for the price.</li>
            <li> I have had this item for a few months.  Within the first few uses the power would seem to \\&quot;surge\\&quot; on the device.  I tried replacing and reinforcing the battery but still surging.  I used it despite this, but now it will not turn on at all even with replacement batteries.  A waste of money.</li>
            <li> You really get what you pay for--This is very true for this product. It is not robustly designed and its very flimsy—did not like this one bit—Philips similar style could have been a better option.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to groom really well! It does what they say it does.</li>
            <li> I ordered one (1) Razor at $19.95 and added what I thought was the &#x27;additional&#x27; twelve (12) blades at $4.95 S/H. Idea Village charged my CC $68 +!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During the &#x27;process&#x27; the phone order system continually tried to force me into buying additional goods and I terminated the phone call! Apparently, this doesn&#x27;t matter. They went ahead and charged my CC, anyway!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be filing a formal complaint with the FL State Attorney Generals office and the FBI ICU (Internet Crime Unit). The is outright thievery!!</li>
            <li> It kind of works if you don&#x27;t use any of the adapters.  Of course, why not just use a normal razor then?  I only really bought it to use with the adapters and I could never get it to work with those.  I have owned this product for months now and I&#x27;ve consistently tried to get it to work but it never has.</li>
            <li> The Micro touch max is awsome - nice and quiet can trim my son&#x27;s hair and he says it tickles - won&#x27;t let me use clippers at all.  My husband likes it too quick and doesn&#x27;t pull on your hair.</li>
            <li> I can not beleive this piece of ppooop,all the advertisment,to end up with this joke...&lt;br /&gt;Will not recomend to any one..&lt;br /&gt;Spend your money on something ellse..</li>
            <li> Seems to work fine.  Problem is, I used it once, next time I tried it wouldn&#x27;t work.  Changed the battery and it worked again.  Then went to use it again and it wouldn&#x27;t work so probably battery again.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo1FH5KF5Z4WIV1]]The Micro Touch comes in an impressive vinyl case with an impressive array of accessories.  It includes two sizes of nail clippers, nail file, travel toothbrush, comb, lint remover with mirror (I think), a tweezer and a shoehorn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately most of the items have questionable quality.  The nail clippers are shiny and seems it will work great until you use it.  They struggle to clip nails except for the thinnest nail on your pinkie. The mirror looks like chrome painted plastic as if you are looking through a frosted shower glass. The toothbrush is stiff and has very few bristles. The shoehorn is small and may work better as a tongue depressor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Micro Touch itself works OK.  First of all, it is not very effective as nasal hair trimmer.  You can&#x27;t really push it in.  The angle of the blade is not designed for it.  For use on the side burn, eyelashes, and any body hair that are easily accessed, it is very useful and works fine.  Still, it feels like underpowered with just a single 1.5V AAA battery.  The LED light is marginally useful as well.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my son since he always was using mine.  Now he has he own and loves it.  For little jobs this&lt;br /&gt;does the trick.</li>
            <li> When I saw the commercial for the micro touch, I have to admit I was intrigued. It appeared to me the trimmer would have a good application in my personal grooming.  I was right, it definitely has a place.  However, the application is somewhat functionally limited. But, when you consider what you get for the current price of about $6, it is definitely worth buying if you have the need.  Since I consider cost/value in relation to product performance, my rating is three stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer build quality leaves a lot to be desired. I would classify it as somewhat fragile in that I really doubt it would survive a fall onto bathroom tile, so I would treat it carefully.  Sure they could have made the build quality along the lines of the  [[ASIN:B000FYVOJC Panasonic ER430K Nose, Ear &amp; Facial Hair Trimmer Wet/Dry with Vacuum Cleaning System]], but that would have doubled the price and increased functionality marginally in my opinion. Build quality aside, the Micro Touch is actually a very simple but functional product, especially in this price range.  The product will easily groom nose, ear, and eyebrow hair. It also will groom edges of beards no problem. Using the Micro Touch on arm hair requires multiple passes unlike the commercial demonstration. Thick hair around the base of the neck also requires multiple passes, but works well in trimming the long hair around your ears for example. So, while the product may not work perfectly all the time, it does everything I need it to do when I need it done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the product at this price point is a good buy in my opinion.  A sample of this product was provided for review.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 of these for family members. Neither of them really worked all that well. One of them had a non-working light right out of the package, but hey, who needs a light on a hair cutting tool? The real kicker, and the reason for the one star, is that neither tool cut hair close enough to make a difference. I wouldn&#x27;t waste my money on this if I were you.</li>
            <li> only worked about 10 minutes now blade doesn&#x27;t move  anymore just makes bussing noise linkage to motor disengaged blades not moving</li>
            <li> Simply, they sent me a defective product. It is cheap, but it is not worth if it is broken.  Good Luck trying to return it.</li>
            <li> The power isn&#x27;t there but it works ok. For what it is and the price I guess it works good enough.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years (the regular MicroTouch, not the Max version -- but they look very similar). &amp;#34;As seen on TV&amp;#34;. Has a light, which can be useful. But, the blades are underpowered and can pull your hairs. The blades often will not start up and get jammed, and I&#x27;ve had to disassemble it often, smack it, get the slider switch positioned &amp;#34;just right&amp;#34;, put mineral oil on the blades, etc. to make it work. I only kept it because I remembered I got it cheap at CVS (I think) and I hadn&#x27;t seen these around in a while (but, I wasn&#x27;t really looking.) Finally, the blade holder would not stay shut, so I decided it was time for a new nose/ear trimmer. I now see these advertised on TV again. But, there are much better products out there. I recently replaced mine with the Philips Norelco, which is far superior, and only slightly more expensive than the MicroTouch.</li>
            <li> I know there are a lot of horrible reviews for this product. The current price is about $6.00. So what should you expect for that price? Not much. However the Micro Touch Max, albeit a cheaply made product, does trim hair. It is small and can get to areas that are harder to reach like nose hairs or ears. It does not trim thick hair on men&#x27;s arms or backs like they show in the commercials unless you go over it again and again. It is just not strong enough. But with a little effort, it will trim thinner hair, leg hair (but really, why would you want to trim your legs using this little blade) fuzzy bits around your face, etc. It comes with different heads to put over the blade for adding length to the trim but I&#x27;ve found that they are pretty worthless. Mine also came with a grooming kit (not sure if it still does but you aren&#x27;t missing much) that has a slot for the Micro Touch, a shoehorn, shoe polisher, tweezers, collapsible toothbrush, comb and two nail trimmers. The only thing that is not plastic are the nail trimmers and tweezers and the tweezers are pretty worthless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So even though it is a controversial rating, I&#x27;m giving these four stars because the price matches the quality and they do work. I was provided a sample to test for review.</li>
            <li> I purchased this micro touch and it worked really well for six months.  then out of nowhere the battery compartment fell off and the silver knob fell off and broke.  I couldn&#x27;t put it back on and then when i did it just stopped working.  the motor doesn&#x27;t run and the silver knob can&#x27;t go back on.  the micro touch is a poorly made trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;waste of money.  I regret purchasing this item.</li>
            <li> The product is good and if it wasn&#x27;t for the battery being gone out of the package I would have given it a better review.</li>
            <li> The cutting blades are not sharp and it has NO power at all. I even put in fresh batteries, but the results were the same. It just tugs and pulls on the wiskers.</li>
            <li> TOTAL JUNK . DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY .</li>
            <li> The item was as described and works well but using it for anything other than fuzz could be frustrating..just keep it in mind.</li>
            <li> This product doest work. i bought it because i saw many positive comments but after all i learned the lesson WE CANNOT BUY ALL WHAT WE SEE.. it doesnt remove anything..</li>
            <li> Not worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> I received this Micro Touch Max as a free sample.  It came in a pouch with some very nice finger and toe nail clippers, some attachments, and a carrying case for the whole system.  Unfortunately as I have had it for some time now, the best quality pieces in the whole system are the nail clippers.  Although this trimmer has some nice attachments and features, its just too damn cheap. The whole feel of this thing is light and flimsy feeling, and a piece of the trimmer end has already broke, even though I was very careful with it.  But even if it were solid with a quality feel, I really couldn&#x27;t recommend it anyway.  The biggest problem I found with it is that its severely under powered.  Even with a fresh battery in it, (and it only takes one), this thing slows down and stalls even in use with the lightest hair.  It works a little better with an attachment, but near useless when used with just the clippers and running it over any hair at all.  You can hear it slow and get bogged down immediately.  Sorry but not recommended...</li>
            <li> Happy with product but took a long time to arrive.</li>
            <li> Why didn&#x27;t I read the reviews before ordering?  I usually do.  I ordered two of these.  I can&#x27;t use either one of them.  They don&#x27;t assemble well or stay together.  I can only work it without the base on it.  Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great and useful for us to do good by</li>
            <li> This item is the most worthless piece of crap I&#x60;ve ever waisted money on.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x60;t waist your money unless you have too much,then send it to me.</li>
            <li> Crap! Waste of time and money!</li>
            <li> i have 2 and they barely run. When they do run fast enough they work well. A waste of money really</li>
            <li> The Micro Touch Max Hair Remover fell apart before I could use it, it just came apart shortly after I took it out of the packet, seems like the packet was holding it together. This can&#x27;t be the first time this has happen to a Micro Touch Max Hair Remover. Product seems defective&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sheila Walker&lt;br /&gt;dall5as@sbcglobal.net</li>
            <li> Works OK. Design not robust. Motor not as strong as more expensive brands. Housing is playable. When you grip it the sides are not sturdy.</li>
            <li> I saw this commercial and was captivated by it so I went online, watched a Youtube review video in which the guy in the video &amp;#34;approved&amp;#34; the item to work.  So I bought it and the dang thing is cheap hard plastic.  You have to twist the bottom part to turn it on and the pieces become loose and the power indicator line don&#x27;t line up to the &amp;#34;off,&amp;#34; &amp;#34;on,&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;light on&amp;#34; switch.  After trying to finagle it, it fumbled out of my hands (a 6&amp;#34; fall) onto the bathroom counter-top and went into pieces.  I put it back together, but it is nothing but a piece of garbage.  It&#x27;s a $10 crappy gadget that makes someone else rich and &amp;#34;nickles out&amp;#34; everyone else.  I&#x27;ll stick to my beard trimmer set...</li>
            <li> Ive used it around 3 times, seems to hold up so far despite other rating I see that say it broke after the first time or never worked.</li>
            <li> Never worked even tried to return and got no response it was a complete waste and the company sold a piece of plastic nothing more don&#x27;t trust</li>
            <li> It needs to be returned but the only reason I didn&#x27;t is because it was so cheap and it&#x27;s not worth the hassle ...  The Light on it Does Not work and rather than cut hair it just pulls it..  It definitely should not be sold through Amazon, A Place I respect for having good quality items..</li>
            <li> Product works just as described, great value.</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t waste your money on this unit. I saw the TV commercial and was sucked in. It does not word and fell apart the day after I got it. Not only that, but it does not cut hair.</li>
            <li> nice little gadget which lasted about 2 uses before breaking. amazon good enough to take it back, but really poor quality item.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a very good product.  My nostril hair gets out of control, and I bought this a few months ago hoping to replace my &amp;#34;who knows how old&amp;#34; trimmer.  First of all it hurts my nostrils.  Secondly, it doesn&#x27;t do a very good job of cutting.  The only way I could use it was as a trimmer after I used scissors, which defeats the purpose in the first place.  At least it&#x27;s an inexpensive product.  I don&#x27;t regret giving it a try for less than $10, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> Everything seemed excellent Lords recommend them to all buyers hope to continue so you buy another oppurtunity in to see your offer thanks</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this as often as I thought I would.  The micro touch is not as powerful as was advertised.</li>
            <li> Im assuming great as it was a gift and we are still friends.</li>
            <li> Feels cheap.  Took some time to get it to cut on.  I&#x27;ll get used to it but want buy another one.</li>
            <li> I bought this to help with my husbands neck area and it does not work very well.  This sits in a drawer after using it once.</li>
            <li> does not work as advertised  Do not buy</li>
            <li> a truelly worthless pile of junk.you&#x27;ll have better luck with a pair of preschool safety scissors,,,John Wayne Trimmer- won&#x27;t take crap off of anything..........</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fake one. Plz, do not buy it. It can&#x27;t cut a single hair.</li>
            <li> Have bought 2 of these and neither one lasted more than a week. Don&#x27;t Buy.</li>
            <li> A piece of crape. The light does not work. Feels like it will fall apart in your hand. And it did. Keep your money.</li>
            <li> total garbage no light  wont cut anything  Amazon should Ban selling this product</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for; maybe even less</li>
            <li> It work well on hairs.</li>
            <li> Broke after 1st use very disapointed will never buy again</li>
            <li> Delivered on time, packaged well and as advertised. Eyebrow management is possible now.</li>
            <li> Powerful safe and easy to use</li>
            <li> Battery went dead quick...Don&#x27;t know why, but it seems to work well.</li>
            <li> I just got it in the mail today. When I used it the light wouldn&#x27;t stay on. Also it doesn&#x27;t cut hair very well, but loves to cut into flesh....</li>
            <li> Never deal with this outfit. They  advertise the cost of product plus cost of transport but charge 50% for all kinds of reasons&lt;br /&gt;Placed the order on Sept 22nd at 3.45 pm for 31.00 including transport and 3 extra heads. Received confirmation of order for $41.95 same day.&lt;br /&gt;Sent e-mail requesting cancellation, but never acknowledge.&lt;br /&gt;If you wish to return you have to use UPS and you pay for transport.&lt;br /&gt;Received item IT IS NOT WORTH THE COST OF A $0.57 STAMP&lt;br /&gt;Think twice before ordering[[ASIN:B0009A0CKE Micro Touches Max, As Seen on TV, Personal Trimmer]]&lt;br /&gt;Micro Tocuh Max&lt;br /&gt; 10303 Norris Ave.,&lt;br /&gt; Pacoima CA 91331</li>
            <li> micro touch no trabajo en ningún momento&lt;br /&gt;desde el que llego no lo he podido utilizar, siento que perdí mi dinero no funciona</li>
            <li> we purchased this based upon seening it on TV.  It was a good price.  It works like any other trimmer but is noisey.</li>
            <li> Nice but cheap shaver. Good for simple grooming.</li>
            <li> not as it stated.  this doesnt not do a hole lot other then just buzz rather than removing hair.</li>
            <li> It is good if you aren&#x27;t prone to a lot of facial hair.  I don&#x27;t have it anymore.</li>
            <li> The flimsy, poorly engineered product did not work. I requested a replacement form the seller and have had no response. The product is junk!</li>
            <li> it broke on the very first use and upon inspection I determined that it was not mad very well at all</li>
            <li> wasn&#x27;t exactly what I expected, Bought it for my husband and he said it was ok for all but the nose,tickled to the point of not being able to use it . Other wise it was ok .</li>
            <li> came broken out of the package, would never ever buy a junk product like this again.&lt;br /&gt;will send it back.</li>
            <li> best product I have found on  the market thus far...works great, get into those hard to reach places and the service was great.</li>
            <li> This does exactly what it says.  It cuts those problem hair growth areas.  Easy to use and very gentle - no scrapes or scratches and the batteries last quite a long time.</li>
            <li> One of the worst product i ever bought! Please don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> I like it a lot and it was a fair price.</li>
