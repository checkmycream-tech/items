            <li>too many holes different</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I ordered.</li>

            <li> Could be good, could be bad.</li>
            <li> So far every single filter in every pack has been loose in the box with the holders.  </li>
            <li> When you find you just can&#x27;t quit but want to at least cut down on the amount of tar and nicotine you get in cigarettes, this item helps significantly.</li>
            <li> l notice not much coughing and the urge to grab a cigarette is diminishing after only two weeks.</li>
            <li> We were very satisfied with our first few purchases of this product, but the last box we bought is awful.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The delivery waiting-time is only a few extra days, coming from Israel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is the first time this has happened, and it is extremely frustrating.  </li>
            <li> Nic Out has cut my smoking down by almost a third after only a few weeks of use.</li>
            <li> After a few days of use you can actually feel the difference, they cut the nicotine levels</li>
            <li> so so  / I have 2 other Asus computer</li>
            <li> I got alot of other people using these and order for them because I quit smoking due to this product!</li>
            <li> The filters work very well but 1 package had over half the filters cracked rendering them worthless in their specific function.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I cant quit yet, but these definitely help cut down my intake and have helped me slowly smoke less.  </li>
            <li> We all know how hard that is, however this product has made breathing easier and much less coughing.  </li>
            <li> Others packs had at least 2-5 cracked filters.</li>
            <li> wholesale mean you have to assemble the product yourself?  </li>
            <li> they&#x27;re inconsistent not a good product</li>
            <li> The filter still takes out the BAD stuff.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Great product, you will feel the and taste the difference.</li>
            <li> We were very satisfied with our first few purchases of this product, but the last box we bought is awful.  So far every single filter in every pack has been loose in the box with the holders.  Each individual filter has to be inserted into the holder before use.  This is the first time this has happened, and it is extremely frustrating.  Does wholesale mean you have to assemble the product yourself?  I don&#x27;t think we will be purchasing this product again.</li>
            <li> great product, they are as advertised and arrived in a timely manner.  Have bought these before from this vendor and will buy again</li>
            <li> This nice out work for me I will order more for family members</li>
            <li> Most of them are clogged up already the holes aren&#x27;t there they&#x27;re inconsistent not a good product</li>
            <li> Great product, If you can&#x27;t quit smoking like me, Please try there filters, the next best thing, catches the tar and some nicotine,30 filters in one box that can be used for several cigarettes can be used with one filter,In the carton are 20 Boxes of 30 Filters.last for months depending on out much you smoke.They are a lot more expensive in tobacco stores.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I cant quit yet, but these definitely help cut down my intake and have helped me slowly smoke less.  The company ships very fast.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at the amount of tar and nicotine they capt.</li>
            <li> is excelent, for my cigarrets, teh filter keep the tabacco there soo is fusibal for us, i like the filter becasuse i can use  alot a thimes like 8 usin so thas was a like more.</li>
            <li> The product works. Before I started using these filters i would cough a lot, now I don&#x27;t. I bought one single box to test it, then I bough 20 more. I have 2 friends that I got to try the filters and they said they were going to purchase them as well.</li>
            <li> Asus 17 -looks so so  / I have 2 other Asus computer both are laptops 1-is 2 yrs old an 5-yrs both have OS-7-P&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  both run alot faster than the new laptop OS 8.1 should have got one with i 7 processor  trying to see the new one .</li>
            <li> This product helps with reducing the tar you inhale. Whether you use it for helping to quit, my reason. The reduction in your tar intake is noticeable with your first filter. Since using this type of product I have quit smoking, although I have my hooka (e-cig) to thank. Good luck!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t smoke a cigarette without one.  I have my whole set of smoking friends using them.  They arrived right away and the price was great.  I would recommend this seller.</li>
            <li> These filters really work, you can see all of the tar that they save from going into your lungs, every smoker should use these. After a few days of use you can actually feel the difference, they cut the nicotine levels any hopefully will help to smoke less.&lt;br /&gt;The filters arrived 4 days ahead of the estimated delivery date.</li>
            <li> This item arrived on time and in perfect condition. I have used 30 filters so far and every one of them works perfectly. They fit a standard cigarette perfectly. They do not take away from the taste at all. I will be purchasing this product again</li>
            <li> was not as good as i have been using. too many holes different taste.i prefer the one i was using</li>
            <li> My husband is a smoker and using the filters has greatly diminished his smokers cough!</li>
            <li> The product is top quality</li>
            <li> When you find you just can&#x27;t quit but want to at least cut down on the amount of tar and nicotine you get in cigarettes, this item helps significantly.</li>
            <li> Yes, they work except the ones that are totally plugged - cannot draw any smoke from them. About 2 out of every box.</li>
            <li> this product is a great help for quitting smoking...l notice not much coughing and the urge to grab a cigarette is diminishing after only two weeks. l bought the twenty box for myself and two others.</li>
            <li> Definately takes the tar out!! No mess to clean..</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not yet ready to quit, but want some visual evidence on why you should, these are great.  They really do capture a lot of tar and nicotine, but remember they are still not capturing all the chemicals in the cigarette.</li>
            <li> These are okay, I prefer One Step at a Time filters but couldn&#x27;t find any on Amazon at the time of this order.</li>
            <li> they helped me quit smoking thank you</li>
            <li> Nic Out has cut my smoking down by almost a third after only a few weeks of use. I would recommend this product for anyone trying to quit.</li>
            <li> excellent product -I do not cough as much since i started purchasing this item...I have copd &amp; should not smoke -- my lung capacity is only 40% - Yes, I should stop smoking as many others should..  We all know how hard that is, however this product has made breathing easier and much less coughing.  I suggest that anyone who smokes should buy this product &amp; use it all the time - I DO !!!</li>
            <li> It is usually the &amp;#34;Best Buy&amp;#34;, direct from the manufacturer, and this is definitely the case with this fine product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The delivery waiting-time is only a few extra days, coming from Israel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The item is more efficient at filtration and tar collection, due to the additional and finer filter holes than its sole competitor.</li>
            <li> These are great for a smoker, lets you see just how much gunk goes into the lungs without them, helps cut down on smoking and hopefully some day quit. Thank you.</li>
            <li> The product was delivered on time with no damage. It&#x27;s exactly what I ordered. I am completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> Nic-Out filters met and exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> Best product anyone could use! I got alot of other people using these and order for them because I quit smoking due to this product!</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo311TKR5WZLV4C]]lack a stripe...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;where is the middle stripe?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this is a imitation?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a fake?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;what is happening?</li>
            <li> TAR BAR FILTERS THE TAR MORE EVENLY &amp; ALSO GET MORE CIG. PER FILTER..NIC-OUT WILL SOMETIME FILTER UP 1 SIDE OF FILTER QUICKLY ...WILL NOT ORDER ANY MORE NIC OUT</li>
            <li> The filters work very well but 1 package had over half the filters cracked rendering them worthless in their specific function. Others packs had at least 2-5 cracked filters.</li>
            <li> These were not for me.  They were for a loved one.  I don&#x27;t smoke and I wouldn&#x27;t know how good or bad these are.  My loved one says it helps keep the tar and nicotine down.  So, I guess they do what the advertise.  I gave it 5 stars because that is what my loved one says how good they are!</li>
            <li> you will see the nikotine in the filter, maybe you feel like a smoke a lite cigarret but it is better</li>
            <li> The filters are great but I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars because of the Quality. Many of the yellow filters are not placed flat inside the transparent plastic holder that makes you feel that it isn&#x27;t working as well as it should</li>
            <li> I can only use each filter for 2 or 3 cigarettes. Could be good, could be bad. I don&#x27;t know</li>
            <li> The filters really trap tars etc.  They only last through about 3 cigarettes, rather than the number advertised.</li>
            <li> The new filters have 8-holes which makes for an easier draw on cigarette. The filter still takes out the BAD stuff.</li>
            <li> I had used tar block filters before.  The nic out easy draw doesn&#x27;t capture as much tar as the tar block and older nic- out filters did.  Which is what I am most after. I coughed less using different filters that trapped more tar.  Honestly, there is no such thing as a safe cigarette, but I think these and other filters are at the very least a bit helpful in keeping your lungs clearer.  Wish they could figure out a way to make the draw easier without losing the benefit of eliminating more of the tar.</li>
            <li> I will only smoke using these filters. They really helped me while going through the quit smoking process.  I recently did quit and I know these filters helped me. If you smoke I strongly recommend you use them.</li>
            <li> If you smoke and can&#x27;t quit, you better get this product! I have been a chain smoker for over 20 years. I could not quit, so I gave Nic-Out a try and love it. I can breathe better and it may extend my life.</li>
