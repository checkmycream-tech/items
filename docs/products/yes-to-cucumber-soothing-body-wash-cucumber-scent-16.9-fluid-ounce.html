            <li>Good value for the money.  </li>
            <li>feel like I am doing something good for myself and my family when I buy this product.</li>
            <li>The scent is fair, and the soap isn&#x27;t creamy and hydrating.  </li>
            <li>does a good job cleansing with making me itch.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s a good deal.  </li>
            <li>ingredients were good.  </li>
            <li>Product is good.</li>
            <li>This is a good body wash</li>
            <li>Smells good, feels good, does good to my skin</li>
            <li>Still, it&#x27;s a good value for the price and quality, so we will be purchasing more!</li>
            <li>This stuff smells great, and works even better.  </li>
            <li>I love this company!</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>product is so great smelling and fabulous on the body.</li>
            <li>The gel lathers up nicely, and I don&#x27;t have to use a lot.</li>
            <li>Nor did feel any kind of soothing sensation.  </li>
            <li>I use about a nickel sized amount on a shower poof during my showers and that was sufficient to work up a good lather and more</li>
            <li>awesome body wash - smells good and makes the skin feel very soft. :)</li>
            <li>My best friends daughter (3 yrs old) keeps smelling my hair and smiling at me!</li>
            <li>Light scent and very refreshing.</li>
            <li>I have been trying to phase out a lot of the chemical laden products in my life and have done a lot of product replacing with the Yes To brands and this shower gel is a perfect example of finding a more natural product that doesn&#x27;t feel like second best.</li>
            <li>I first started using \\&quot;Yes to\\&quot; products with their heavy carrot hand cream, and was impressed-- and continue to be impressed.</li>
            <li>I prefer a stronger more long-lasting &amp;#34;flavor&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>So if you do not want a lingering scent or fragrance, you will love this.  </li>
            <li>If you prefer a bit more fragrance, this may not be it.  </li>
            <li>I like many body washes.  </li>
            <li>They used to put a lot more effort to keep the product 98% organic and this is not the case any more, so buyer beware.</li>
            <li>all love it.</li>
            <li>I love this...</li>
            <li>It seems very concentrated and works up a great lather in my shower pouf.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;What makes me happiest is the lovely scent.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Because we already use the &#x27;Say Yes to Carrots&#x27; Shampoo and Conditioner (both superb), we decided to try another product from the same line. &#x27;</li>
            <li>I really love this body wash</li>
            <li>way better than yes to carrots body wash</li>
            <li>In order to get the soap out, we had to take off the top.  </li>
            <li>Will definitly by more.  </li>
            <li>, it doesn&#x27;t get any better.  </li>
            <li>Love it!&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li>Love the Yes to Carrots Brand.</li>
            <li>Love the way my skin feels after using this and love the cucumber scent.</li>
            <li>My skin feels more like skin afterwards, if that makes any sense.</li>
            <li>I loved the smell of the fresh cucumbers, but it did not work well for me.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t love the scent.</li>
            <li>I love the clean scent and it works well, plus it is cruelty free and a fair price</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t actually feel like soap at all; it&#x27;s more like extra-clean water (and with a very pleasant scent too).  </li>
            <li>Super pleased!</li>
            <li>an all around pretty good product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>cause the scent is strong, and I guarantee you&#x27;ll love this product.</li>
            <li>The scent also stays strong in the shower.</li>
            <li>Its not too strong and doesn&#x27;t have that overpowering floral smell that a lot of body washes have.  </li>
            <li>The smell is great while using, but barely perceptible after getting out of the shower.  </li>
            <li>We all know that cucumbers have a nice fresh, cool scent, but with bath and body products, you need to balance the scent as you don&#x27;t want to wash with something that smells like you just picked from your vegetable garden.</li>
            <li>The wash works fine.</li>
            <li>The cucumber smell is fine.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s getting used up too quickly!  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s good for sensitive skin and keeps moisture in!</li>
            <li>I do like the fresh mild cucumber scent, and it lathers nicely in my hair and body.  </li>
            <li>I give it three stars because that fresh cucumber scent is very light.  </li>
            <li>great, natural shower gel, and surprisingly inexpensive, especially using Subscribe+Save.  </li>
            <li>It is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li>Clean scent ans super sudsy!  </li>
            <li>A pleasant-smelling, richly lathering bath gel.</li>
            <li>Cucumber\\&quot; gel seems to hit all of my demands, I&#x27;ve been very pleased so far.</li>
            <li>I liked the smell and the lather was normal.</li>
            <li>But what it does do is gets you clean.  </li>
            <li>But there are better products out there for sensitive skin that have much more user-friendly dispenser caps.</li>
            <li>This stuff smells great and is gentle on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I decided to use it only on my body because it was pleasant smelling</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s scent is gender neutral and is great for washing your face because it doesn&#x27;t dry your skin out!</li>
            <li>Also, I eat fresh cucumbers just fine and use cucumber face soaps.</li>
            <li>I liked it and it was natural, and</li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s ok, even using that much this shower gel has lasted me over five months,</li>
            <li>made a nice soft layer of bubbles.  </li>
            <li>Not bad &amp; doesn&#x27;t linger either.</li>
            <li>I have been SLS free for 9 months and this is my favorite shower gel by far!</li>
            <li>This bodywash has way more more chemicals than the other natural products I&#x27;ve used (eg: Pangea organics, Alaffia, Three sisters apothecary, etc.), and doesn&#x27;t feel any good on the skin.</li>
            <li>I mean, it&#x27;s great just to use in general too but the soothing element of it works great as well.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel very soft and healthy and the scent is wonderfully clean and invigorating.  </li>
            <li>Makes the skin very smooth and soft for shaving your legs.</li>
            <li>I used this for the first time after reading a recommendation and I will be purchasing some for gift baskets for birthdays and special occasions.  </li>
            <li>The smell is calm and not overpowering at all, which I like.</li>
            <li>And the fresh scent was an added bonus.</li>
            <li>If you like the smell of fresh cucumbers, and you strive to avoid putting chemicals all over your body that disrupt your hormones (and your children&#x27;s hormones)</li>
            <li>I just purchased this soap in an effort to use more natural products.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this product and it works well with my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Wanting to switch to more natural health &amp; beauty products, I purchased this shower gel.  </li>
            <li>I bought it because I wanted something natural and safe, but this backfired.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and my skin feels so soft.</li>
            <li>As others have mentioned, you can&#x27;t get the product to dispense at all, and you have to completely remove the top and pour it out.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not super picky about soaps (and don&#x27;t really have allergies), so as long as it smells good and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li>It smells so refreshing, lathers really well, and leaves my skin feeling soft and clean afterwards.</li>
            <li>Very soothing and smells really cool and fresh.</li>
            <li>The scent is very fresh, it foams very nicely and it has been lasting for a long time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad they balanced the cucumber scent perfectly with green tea and aloe, as they create a calming green scent, but it also seems to have a bit of some floral notes in the background as well.</li>
            <li>Lathers just right, and very affordable with an adequate amount for the price.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way with this product or it will dry you out, but when I use the perfect amount my skin is very satisfied.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a different feel of clean, than traditional soaps, but it&#x27;s a good feel.  </li>
            <li>Also shipping was very fast.  </li>
            <li>smells good, a little expenseive on line used to get it at&lt;br /&gt;walgreens</li>
            <li>The only thing I could really complain about is that it doesn&#x27;t have a very strong smell.  </li>
            <li>AXE is my favorite; so I alternate products.  </li>
            <li>The cucumber shower gel was the first of</li>
            <li>First time seeing these at walgreens today</li>
            <li>I have tried so many different kinds of body wash; axe, dove, dial, and others I can&#x27;t remember</li>
            <li>I used this once today and my skin felt soft, hydrated, and itchy free.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m actually quite pleased as it manages to leave my skin soft and smooth</li>
            <li>We have been using natural chemical free soaps for years, but I wanted a liquid that could be used with a cleansing pad.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only problem I&#x27;ve found: my daughters love it too</li>
            <li>The cucumber is very calming, and it helps calm me at the end of a stressful day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>Thanks for the strength conditioning every morning!</li>
            <li>The scent doesn&#x27;t last on the skin &amp; it doesn&#x27;t work any better than Suave or Caress.</li>
            <li>Say Yes to Cucumbers&#x27; has a gentle fresh scent, and did not dry my skin out, and is even more effective when used with the EcoPouf Cleansing pad, which is neither too rough nor too gentle.</li>
            <li>This body wash lathers like crazy, smells like cucumbers (good!), and leaves the skin feeling smooth and fresh.</li>
            <li>Not perfumy or sweet or combined with a fruit fragrance like most of the other brands.  </li>
            <li>And doing so puts out way too much soap; so I don&#x27;t expect this to last for more than a week or two.</li>
            <li>Overall, it is a good value for the money, but I may end up putting it in a different bottle for use of use.</li>
            <li>I would have liked to actually smell the cucumbers and while there is a barely discernible flowery smell, there&#x27;s not that cucumber smell for me.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, this body wash does seem mild and does not irritate my sensitive, rosacea-prone skin.  </li>
            <li>Like anything, some people react to certain products and some do not.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell really at all</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t bubble up or foam too much</li>
            <li>and I paid so much for it.  </li>
            <li>I have to unscrew the whole cap, and then too much product pours out.</li>
            <li>I have a very keen &amp;#34;smeller&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Smells really yummy</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it on my face but my chest will breakout if I try to use a very scented wash.</li>
            <li>Nothing more disappointing that buying a body wash that smells good in the bottle and has a scent that dissipates in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love it because being a man, I&#x27;m tired of the \\&quot;axe\\&quot; and \\&quot;old spice\\&quot; smelly body washes and who knows what kind of chemicals they use.</li>
            <li>To&#x27;s products I had ever tried, and it left my skin soft, clean and comfortable, without stripping out the natural oils in my skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Often times I have spent way more on a product only to have to use half the bottle just to get a lather, or a good amount of conditioner..</li>
            <li>It rinsed easily and my skin didn&#x27;t feel dry and itchy afterwards.</li>
            <li>I have tried many other natural soaps and body washes, and none of the other sulfite or parabin free washes even come close!  </li>
            <li>decent shower gel.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used it I spent 5 minutes looking at it to make sure I had it open all the way.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s high rating on Amazon, atleast I&#x27;m saying \\&quot;NO\\&quot; to all of these products.</li>
            <li>then I highly recommend this</li>
            <li>buy again, and highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this body wash to everyone.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure about the chemical composition of this shower gel, but it seems very easy on your body and eyes.</li>
            <li>It stings and burns mucous membranes, which do get suds on them in the normal process of washing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Hardly no suds.</li>
            <li>Leaves me feeling clean and fresh without excessive soap residue.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Review by M. Reynard 2012I like new things,</li>
            <li>The design of the packaging could be improved - the body wash does not flow easily out of the cap, which makes showering less time efficient.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s 95% natural!</li>
            <li>and I know it contains natural ingredients!</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t say whether or not this gel actually calms and soothes irritated skin, but it certainly didn&#x27;t cause new irritation for me.  </li>
            <li>The cucumber smell is good, but it&#x27;s quickly followed by a really bad chemical smell when used in shower.</li>
            <li>As a guy that is constantly working out and sweating either from the gym or work, this body wash really helps clear up my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised with</li>
            <li>and it really does soothe irritation especially after I shave.</li>
            <li>I tried this because it was SLS free and hoped it wouldn&#x27;t be harsh.</li>
            <li>body wash is a light pearlescent green and has a medium consistency.</li>
            <li>According to the bottle, 99.8% of this product is natural.  </li>
            <li>The scent is  mild/natural with a distinct note of cucumbers, and doesn&#x27;t linger as anything other than a hint of \\&quot;clean\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I quickly discovered that I need a lot less of this body wash than others I have used.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t experience any irritation despite my skin generally being sensitive.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I expected from a bottle this size.  </li>
            <li>When the bottle was nearly empty, I simply turn the bottle upside down and make sure to snap close the opening.  </li>
            <li>I try to stick to natural products, or those who have a low impact on the earth.  </li>
            <li>but I can BARELY smell any cucumber in this stuff.  </li>
            <li>No manly scent here but after using this bottle for 3 months its completely cleaned up my chest and back.</li>
            <li>This is the only body wash that i have used that doesn&#x27;t make me break out or dry my skin out much.</li>
            <li>and I both use the same bath gels, and I&#x27;m sensitive to fake fragrances, so we look for natural products that are strong enough to get me clean, but not hard on her skin, and don&#x27;t smell excessively gender</li>
            <li>I will definitely order more and probably try a few other products in this line.</li>
            <li>It also worked pretty well as bath bubbles, a little bit squeezed into a bathtub</li>
            <li>I had a terrible time getting the top to work right and ended up just tearing the top half off which meant if the bottle wound up in the tub it would leak out.</li>
            <li>I tend to get really red and irritated after shaving and this stuff really takes that down alot.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll keep trying other ones as I like new things, but this is one I&#x27;d consider using again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I first started using \\&quot;Yes to\\&quot; products with their heavy carrot hand cream, and was impressed-- and continue to be impressed.</li>
            <li> I prefer a stronger more long-lasting &amp;#34;flavor&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> So if you do not want a lingering scent or fragrance, you will love this.  </li>
            <li> If you prefer a bit more fragrance, this may not be it.  </li>
            <li> I like many body washes.  </li>
            <li> They used to put a lot more effort to keep the product 98% organic and this is not the case any more, so buyer beware.</li>
            <li> all love it.</li>
            <li> I love this...</li>
            <li> It seems very concentrated and works up a great lather in my shower pouf.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;What makes me happiest is the lovely scent.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Because we already use the &#x27;Say Yes to Carrots&#x27; Shampoo and Conditioner (both superb), we decided to try another product from the same line. &#x27;</li>
            <li> I really love this body wash</li>
            <li> way better than yes to carrots body wash</li>
            <li> In order to get the soap out, we had to take off the top.  </li>
            <li> Will definitly by more.  </li>
            <li> , it doesn&#x27;t get any better.  </li>
            <li> Love it!&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li> Love the Yes to Carrots Brand.</li>
            <li> Love the way my skin feels after using this and love the cucumber scent.</li>
            <li> My skin feels more like skin afterwards, if that makes any sense.</li>
            <li> I loved the smell of the fresh cucumbers, but it did not work well for me.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t love the scent.</li>
            <li> I love the clean scent and it works well, plus it is cruelty free and a fair price</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t actually feel like soap at all; it&#x27;s more like extra-clean water (and with a very pleasant scent too).  </li>
            <li> Super pleased!</li>
            <li> an all around pretty good product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> cause the scent is strong, and I guarantee you&#x27;ll love this product.</li>
            <li> The scent also stays strong in the shower.</li>
            <li> Its not too strong and doesn&#x27;t have that overpowering floral smell that a lot of body washes have.  </li>
            <li> The smell is great while using, but barely perceptible after getting out of the shower.  </li>
            <li> We all know that cucumbers have a nice fresh, cool scent, but with bath and body products, you need to balance the scent as you don&#x27;t want to wash with something that smells like you just picked from your vegetable garden.</li>
            <li> The wash works fine.</li>
            <li> The cucumber smell is fine.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s getting used up too quickly!  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good for sensitive skin and keeps moisture in!</li>
            <li> I do like the fresh mild cucumber scent, and it lathers nicely in my hair and body.  </li>
            <li> I give it three stars because that fresh cucumber scent is very light.  </li>
            <li> great, natural shower gel, and surprisingly inexpensive, especially using Subscribe+Save.  </li>
            <li> It is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li> Clean scent ans super sudsy!  </li>
            <li> A pleasant-smelling, richly lathering bath gel.</li>
            <li> Cucumber\\&quot; gel seems to hit all of my demands, I&#x27;ve been very pleased so far.</li>
            <li> I liked the smell and the lather was normal.</li>
            <li> But what it does do is gets you clean.  </li>
            <li> But there are better products out there for sensitive skin that have much more user-friendly dispenser caps.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great and is gentle on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I decided to use it only on my body because it was pleasant smelling</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s scent is gender neutral and is great for washing your face because it doesn&#x27;t dry your skin out!</li>
            <li> Also, I eat fresh cucumbers just fine and use cucumber face soaps.</li>
            <li> I liked it and it was natural, and</li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s ok, even using that much this shower gel has lasted me over five months,</li>
            <li> made a nice soft layer of bubbles.  </li>
            <li> Not bad &amp; doesn&#x27;t linger either.</li>
            <li> I have been SLS free for 9 months and this is my favorite shower gel by far!</li>
            <li> This bodywash has way more more chemicals than the other natural products I&#x27;ve used (eg: Pangea organics, Alaffia, Three sisters apothecary, etc.), and doesn&#x27;t feel any good on the skin.</li>
            <li> I mean, it&#x27;s great just to use in general too but the soothing element of it works great as well.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel very soft and healthy and the scent is wonderfully clean and invigorating.  </li>
            <li> Makes the skin very smooth and soft for shaving your legs.</li>
            <li> I used this for the first time after reading a recommendation and I will be purchasing some for gift baskets for birthdays and special occasions.  </li>
            <li> The smell is calm and not overpowering at all, which I like.</li>
            <li> And the fresh scent was an added bonus.</li>
            <li> If you like the smell of fresh cucumbers, and you strive to avoid putting chemicals all over your body that disrupt your hormones (and your children&#x27;s hormones)</li>
            <li> I just purchased this soap in an effort to use more natural products.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this product and it works well with my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Wanting to switch to more natural health &amp; beauty products, I purchased this shower gel.  </li>
            <li> I bought it because I wanted something natural and safe, but this backfired.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and my skin feels so soft.</li>
            <li> As others have mentioned, you can&#x27;t get the product to dispense at all, and you have to completely remove the top and pour it out.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not super picky about soaps (and don&#x27;t really have allergies), so as long as it smells good and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> It smells so refreshing, lathers really well, and leaves my skin feeling soft and clean afterwards.</li>
            <li> Very soothing and smells really cool and fresh.</li>
            <li> The scent is very fresh, it foams very nicely and it has been lasting for a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad they balanced the cucumber scent perfectly with green tea and aloe, as they create a calming green scent, but it also seems to have a bit of some floral notes in the background as well.</li>
            <li> Lathers just right, and very affordable with an adequate amount for the price.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way with this product or it will dry you out, but when I use the perfect amount my skin is very satisfied.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a different feel of clean, than traditional soaps, but it&#x27;s a good feel.  </li>
            <li> Also shipping was very fast.  </li>
            <li> smells good, a little expenseive on line used to get it at&lt;br /&gt;walgreens</li>
            <li> The only thing I could really complain about is that it doesn&#x27;t have a very strong smell.  </li>
            <li> AXE is my favorite; so I alternate products.  </li>
            <li> The cucumber shower gel was the first of</li>
            <li> First time seeing these at walgreens today</li>
            <li> I have tried so many different kinds of body wash; axe, dove, dial, and others I can&#x27;t remember</li>
            <li> I used this once today and my skin felt soft, hydrated, and itchy free.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually quite pleased as it manages to leave my skin soft and smooth</li>
            <li> We have been using natural chemical free soaps for years, but I wanted a liquid that could be used with a cleansing pad.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only problem I&#x27;ve found: my daughters love it too</li>
            <li> The cucumber is very calming, and it helps calm me at the end of a stressful day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> Thanks for the strength conditioning every morning!</li>
            <li> The scent doesn&#x27;t last on the skin &amp; it doesn&#x27;t work any better than Suave or Caress.</li>
            <li> Say Yes to Cucumbers&#x27; has a gentle fresh scent, and did not dry my skin out, and is even more effective when used with the EcoPouf Cleansing pad, which is neither too rough nor too gentle.</li>
            <li> This body wash lathers like crazy, smells like cucumbers (good!), and leaves the skin feeling smooth and fresh.</li>
            <li> Not perfumy or sweet or combined with a fruit fragrance like most of the other brands.  </li>
            <li> And doing so puts out way too much soap; so I don&#x27;t expect this to last for more than a week or two.</li>
            <li> Overall, it is a good value for the money, but I may end up putting it in a different bottle for use of use.</li>
            <li> I would have liked to actually smell the cucumbers and while there is a barely discernible flowery smell, there&#x27;s not that cucumber smell for me.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, this body wash does seem mild and does not irritate my sensitive, rosacea-prone skin.  </li>
            <li> Like anything, some people react to certain products and some do not.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell really at all</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t bubble up or foam too much</li>
            <li> and I paid so much for it.  </li>
            <li> I have to unscrew the whole cap, and then too much product pours out.</li>
            <li> I have a very keen &amp;#34;smeller&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Smells really yummy</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it on my face but my chest will breakout if I try to use a very scented wash.</li>
            <li> Nothing more disappointing that buying a body wash that smells good in the bottle and has a scent that dissipates in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love it because being a man, I&#x27;m tired of the \\&quot;axe\\&quot; and \\&quot;old spice\\&quot; smelly body washes and who knows what kind of chemicals they use.</li>
            <li> To&#x27;s products I had ever tried, and it left my skin soft, clean and comfortable, without stripping out the natural oils in my skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Often times I have spent way more on a product only to have to use half the bottle just to get a lather, or a good amount of conditioner..</li>
            <li> It rinsed easily and my skin didn&#x27;t feel dry and itchy afterwards.</li>
            <li> I have tried many other natural soaps and body washes, and none of the other sulfite or parabin free washes even come close!  </li>
            <li> decent shower gel.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used it I spent 5 minutes looking at it to make sure I had it open all the way.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s high rating on Amazon, atleast I&#x27;m saying \\&quot;NO\\&quot; to all of these products.</li>
            <li> then I highly recommend this</li>
            <li> buy again, and highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this body wash to everyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about the chemical composition of this shower gel, but it seems very easy on your body and eyes.</li>
            <li> It stings and burns mucous membranes, which do get suds on them in the normal process of washing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hardly no suds.</li>
            <li> Leaves me feeling clean and fresh without excessive soap residue.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Review by M. Reynard 2012I like new things,</li>
            <li> The design of the packaging could be improved - the body wash does not flow easily out of the cap, which makes showering less time efficient.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s 95% natural!</li>
            <li> and I know it contains natural ingredients!</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t say whether or not this gel actually calms and soothes irritated skin, but it certainly didn&#x27;t cause new irritation for me.  </li>
            <li> The cucumber smell is good, but it&#x27;s quickly followed by a really bad chemical smell when used in shower.</li>
            <li> As a guy that is constantly working out and sweating either from the gym or work, this body wash really helps clear up my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised with</li>
            <li> and it really does soothe irritation especially after I shave.</li>
            <li> I tried this because it was SLS free and hoped it wouldn&#x27;t be harsh.</li>
            <li> body wash is a light pearlescent green and has a medium consistency.</li>
            <li> According to the bottle, 99.8% of this product is natural.  </li>
            <li> The scent is  mild/natural with a distinct note of cucumbers, and doesn&#x27;t linger as anything other than a hint of \\&quot;clean\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I quickly discovered that I need a lot less of this body wash than others I have used.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t experience any irritation despite my skin generally being sensitive.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I expected from a bottle this size.  </li>
            <li> When the bottle was nearly empty, I simply turn the bottle upside down and make sure to snap close the opening.  </li>
            <li> I try to stick to natural products, or those who have a low impact on the earth.  </li>
            <li> but I can BARELY smell any cucumber in this stuff.  </li>
            <li> No manly scent here but after using this bottle for 3 months its completely cleaned up my chest and back.</li>
            <li> This is the only body wash that i have used that doesn&#x27;t make me break out or dry my skin out much.</li>
            <li> and I both use the same bath gels, and I&#x27;m sensitive to fake fragrances, so we look for natural products that are strong enough to get me clean, but not hard on her skin, and don&#x27;t smell excessively gender</li>
            <li> I will definitely order more and probably try a few other products in this line.</li>
            <li> It also worked pretty well as bath bubbles, a little bit squeezed into a bathtub</li>
            <li> I had a terrible time getting the top to work right and ended up just tearing the top half off which meant if the bottle wound up in the tub it would leak out.</li>
            <li> I tend to get really red and irritated after shaving and this stuff really takes that down alot.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep trying other ones as I like new things, but this is one I&#x27;d consider using again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has that fresh, pungent, earthy, green sharp smell of a farm-fresh cucumber.  </li>
            <li> For years I have searched for a skin cleanser that wouldn&#x27;t dry me out, or leave my back feeling itchy afterwards.</li>
            <li> My skin has started to clear up after only a few weeks of use.</li>
            <li> I also wanted to know what was in my shower gel, and was alarmed at the number of mainstream cleansers that contained Sodium Laureth/Lauryl Sulfates that dry out the skin.</li>
            <li> and they all gave me dry itchy skin.</li>
            <li> Cucumbers is a clean smell not a girly scent, a manly scent, or a fake chemically cotton candy kiddie scent.</li>
            <li> I was constantly itching during these months where the temps go up and down, but haven&#x27;t since I started using this.  </li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s part of the problem, but it really is difficult to do (you have to squeeze the whole bottle really hard to get any to come out, and then only a tiny bit comes out), and I think it would be difficult for most</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super inconvenient to open the lid every time to pour out the soap.</li>
            <li> I never really have irrated skin</li>
            <li> I used to use Dove soap because &amp;#34;ordinary&amp;#34; soap, i.e. Ivory, both dried my skin and left a waxy feeling on it.  </li>
            <li> After going thru a few of them I&#x27;ve found the cap to be defective in that it won&#x27;t fully open</li>
            <li> good product inside bottle but very bad dispenser.</li>
            <li> Infact, it leaves your skin pretty dry and uncomfortable after shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It smells terrific (not floral and  not strong)</li>
            <li> I do plan to try the other &amp;#34;Yes&amp;#34; products; carrot, blueberry etc., to see how they feel and look.  </li>
            <li> I will try other YesTo products</li>
            <li> (there&#x27;s also yes to carrots and other veggies out there)</li>
            <li> Plan on trying some other scents too.</li>
            <li> This is one of the worse \\&quot;natural body wash\\&quot; products I&#x27;ve used in 2 years.</li>
            <li> Secondary to that, however, is the absence of scent.  </li>
            <li> less bathroom clutter.</li>
            <li> I broke out in a slight rash both times using it.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I washed my face with it and it stung my eyes like crazy.</li>
            <li> While it does contain moisturizing ingredients, the formulation isn&#x27;t heavy and greasy.</li>
            <li> Waste of money....</li>
            <li> The opening in the lid is a little small</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s an effort to show you how little soap you need, or</li>
            <li> I disliked how hard i had to squeeze to get the body wash out of the container.</li>
            <li> I have been a DOVE user for the past 5 years, and although the product works well with my skin I decided I wanted to cut sulfates from my skin/hair.</li>
            <li> No more his and hers soap needed in my apartment &#x3D;</li>
            <li> This is truly just too dangerous to use, especially with kids!</li>
            <li> Finally ordered it through Amazon &amp; it is a disappointment.</li>
            <li> This soap doesn&#x27;t do either of those things, but it is RIDICULOUS to get out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Other criteria are: not be drying or harsh, and not have any of the cloyingly fake smells mainstream bath gels often have.</li>
            <li> The fragrance ingredient was merely listed as fragrance though, so I&#x27;m not sure what scents this product.  </li>
            <li> Watery, poor scent, and leaves you feeling like you need to take another shower after using it.  </li>
            <li> It just feels like another of those fake \\&quot;marketed as natural\\&quot; products.</li>
            <li> This product is dangerous.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The worst part of the product is the lid-- its opening so narrow, no liquid comes out of it!</li>
            <li> which is too bad.</li>
            <li> It was horribly painful and I am not a wimp.</li>
            <li> won&#x27;t be buying it again :(</li>
            <li> Promise you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I have not had any awful breakouts from this body wash.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I do like the fresh mild cucumber scent, and it lathers nicely in my hair and body.  I give it three stars because that fresh cucumber scent is very light.  I prefer a stronger more long-lasting &amp;#34;flavor&amp;#34;.  So if you do not want a lingering scent or fragrance, you will love this.  If you prefer a bit more fragrance, this may not be it.  I do plan to try the other &amp;#34;Yes&amp;#34; products; carrot, blueberry etc., to see how they feel and look.  No problem with the bottle.  When the bottle was nearly empty, I simply turn the bottle upside down and make sure to snap close the opening.  Good value for the money.  I am the only one using my body wash, and this lasted me for a month; about 30-35 showers.  This is exactly what I expected from a bottle this size.  I like many body washes.  AXE is my favorite; so I alternate products.  Bottom line...the scent was to &amp;#34;mild&amp;#34; for me.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a  couple of years now, still like it.</li>
            <li> For years I have searched for a skin cleanser that wouldn&#x27;t dry me out, or leave my back feeling itchy afterwards. I also wanted to know what was in my shower gel, and was alarmed at the number of mainstream cleansers that contained Sodium Laureth/Lauryl Sulfates that dry out the skin. The cucumber shower gel was the first of Yes To&#x27;s products I had ever tried, and it left my skin soft, clean and comfortable, without stripping out the natural oils in my skin. And the fresh scent was an added bonus.</li>
            <li> Cause for concern, recently I checked the chemical labeling for this product and it has changed.It now has PHENOXYETHANOL, COCAMIDOPROPYL BETAINE, FRAGRANCE, SODIUM BENZOATE, and POTASSIUM SORBATE. They used to put a lot more effort to keep the product 98% organic and this is not the case any more, so buyer beware.</li>
            <li> Smells great and is great.  Made my skin softer and smoother!!!</li>
            <li> First time seeing these at walgreens today so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try, and I LOVED it!!    I have tried so many different kinds of body wash; axe, dove, dial, and others I can&#x27;t remember and they all gave me dry itchy skin. I used this once today and my skin felt soft, hydrated, and itchy free. I will definitely be buying this again!</li>
            <li> This is one of the worse \\&quot;natural body wash\\&quot; products I&#x27;ve used in 2 years. The cucumber smell is good, but it&#x27;s quickly followed by a really bad chemical smell when used in shower. This bodywash has way more more chemicals than the other natural products I&#x27;ve used (eg: Pangea organics, Alaffia, Three sisters apothecary, etc.), and doesn&#x27;t feel any good on the skin. Infact, it leaves your skin pretty dry and uncomfortable after shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The worst part of the product is the lid-- its opening so narrow, no liquid comes out of it! It&#x27;s super inconvenient to open the lid every time to pour out the soap. And doing so puts out way too much soap; so I don&#x27;t expect this to last for more than a week or two. I&#x27;m surprised with it&#x27;s high rating on Amazon, atleast I&#x27;m saying \\&quot;NO\\&quot; to all of these products. It just feels like another of those fake \\&quot;marketed as natural\\&quot; products.</li>
            <li> If you like the smell of fresh cucumbers, and you strive to avoid putting chemicals all over your body that disrupt your hormones (and your children&#x27;s hormones) then I highly recommend this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;99.8% natural!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel like I am doing something good for myself and my family when I buy this product. I know Im not contributing to health issues. I appreciate the low affordable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Often times I have spent way more on a product only to have to use half the bottle just to get a lather, or a good amount of conditioner.. but with this product it simply just WORKS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We all love it. My best friends daughter (3 yrs old) keeps smelling my hair and smiling at me! My husband even loves it. Cucumbers is a clean smell not a girly scent, a manly scent, or a fake chemically cotton candy kiddie scent. Its simply clean!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes it makes me crave cucumbers it smells so amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try and use all of these products. I love this company!</li>
            <li> Love the product but the cap is sometimes clogged or difficult to squirt, I just take the cap off when that happens.</li>
            <li> I have been a DOVE user for the past 5 years, and although the product works well with my skin I decided I wanted to cut sulfates from my skin/hair. I invested in YTC and my skin loves the YTCucumber body wash. I patch tested on skin before use and I have been using it fully for about 2 weeks now. A little goes a long way with this product or it will dry you out, but when I use the perfect amount my skin is very satisfied. The smell is calm and not overpowering at all, which I like.</li>
            <li> I love this...It doesn&#x27;t smell really at all and it really does soothe irritation especially after I shave. I tend to get really red and irritated after shaving and this stuff really takes that down alot. I mean, it&#x27;s great just to use in general too but the soothing element of it works great as well.</li>
            <li> This is the only body wash that i have used that doesn&#x27;t make me break out or dry my skin out much. Smells awesome too!</li>
            <li> Light scent and very refreshing. I plan to buy this product again. I think all the Yes to Cucumber products are excellent. So are the Yes to Carrots.</li>
            <li> I tried this because it was SLS free and hoped it wouldn&#x27;t be harsh. It didn&#x27;t disappoint!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The body wash is a light pearlescent green and has a medium consistency. The opening in the lid is a little small but I quickly discovered that I need a lot less of this body wash than others I have used. It seems very concentrated and works up a great lather in my shower pouf.  It rinsed easily and my skin didn&#x27;t feel dry and itchy afterwards. While it does contain moisturizing ingredients, the formulation isn&#x27;t heavy and greasy. I&#x27;m actually quite pleased as it manages to leave my skin soft and smooth and I don&#x27;t feel like I have to immediately apply lotion or body butter to replenish my skin, as I do with harsher body washes that leave my skin feeling stripped of moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What makes me happiest is the lovely scent. We all know that cucumbers have a nice fresh, cool scent, but with bath and body products, you need to balance the scent as you don&#x27;t want to wash with something that smells like you just picked from your vegetable garden. I&#x27;m glad they balanced the cucumber scent perfectly with green tea and aloe, as they create a calming green scent, but it also seems to have a bit of some floral notes in the background as well. The scent also stays strong in the shower. Nothing more disappointing that buying a body wash that smells good in the bottle and has a scent that dissipates in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 stars!</li>
            <li> A pleasant-smelling, richly lathering bath gel. The gel lathers up nicely, and I don&#x27;t have to use a lot. The scent is  mild/natural with a distinct note of cucumbers, and doesn&#x27;t linger as anything other than a hint of \\&quot;clean\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The GF and I both use the same bath gels, and I&#x27;m sensitive to fake fragrances, so we look for natural products that are strong enough to get me clean, but not hard on her skin, and don&#x27;t smell excessively gender-specific-- I don&#x27;t want to smell like strawberries + candy and she doesn&#x27;t want to smell like musk + pine!  This Cucumber gel fits the bill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other criteria are: not be drying or harsh, and not have any of the cloyingly fake smells mainstream bath gels often have. This \\&quot;Yes to Cucumber\\&quot; gel seems to hit all of my demands, I&#x27;ve been very pleased so far. I don&#x27;t experience any irritation despite my skin generally being sensitive. I first started using \\&quot;Yes to\\&quot; products with their heavy carrot hand cream, and was impressed-- and continue to be impressed. We&#x27;ve also been using their \\&quot;Carrots\\&quot; bath gel, and I plan to try out their tomato and grapefruit variants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great, natural shower gel, and surprisingly inexpensive, especially using Subscribe+Save.  Recommended!</li>
            <li> We have been using natural chemical free soaps for years, but I wanted a liquid that could be used with a cleansing pad.&lt;br /&gt;Because we already use the &#x27;Say Yes to Carrots&#x27; Shampoo and Conditioner (both superb), we decided to try another product from the same line. &#x27;Say Yes to Cucumbers&#x27; has a gentle fresh scent, and did not dry my skin out, and is even more effective when used with the EcoPouf Cleansing pad, which is neither too rough nor too gentle. Nor does it absorb and waste too much of the Shower Gel.  A perfect combination.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. Smells wonderful. Soaps up well. I love it because being a man, I&#x27;m tired of the \\&quot;axe\\&quot; and \\&quot;old spice\\&quot; smelly body washes and who knows what kind of chemicals they use. I&#x27;m not sure about the chemical composition of this shower gel, but it seems very easy on your body and eyes.</li>
            <li> Very soothing and smells really cool and fresh. Makes the skin very smooth and soft for shaving your legs. Try it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s scent is gender neutral and is great for washing your face because it doesn&#x27;t dry your skin out! I really love this body wash it&#x27;s good for sensitive skin and keeps moisture in! way better than yes to carrots body wash</li>
            <li> I just purchased this soap in an effort to use more natural products. I&#x27;m not super picky about soaps (and don&#x27;t really have allergies), so as long as it smells good and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, I&#x27;m happy. This soap doesn&#x27;t do either of those things, but it is RIDICULOUS to get out of the bottle. The first time I used it I spent 5 minutes looking at it to make sure I had it open all the way. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s an effort to show you how little soap you need, or what, but you can only get a tiny drip out at a time. I probably won&#x27;t buy again just for that reason - I&#x27;ll probably rebuy this brand, just a different bottle.</li>
            <li> The smell of this wash is very pleasant. The wash works fine. Doesn&#x27;t bubble up or foam too much which is too bad. I had a terrible time getting the top to work right and ended up just tearing the top half off which meant if the bottle wound up in the tub it would leak out.</li>
            <li> I have been trying to phase out a lot of the chemical laden products in my life and have done a lot of product replacing with the Yes To brands and this shower gel is a perfect example of finding a more natural product that doesn&#x27;t feel like second best. The scent is very fresh, it foams very nicely and it has been lasting for a long time. This is a great product.</li>
            <li> In order to get the soap out, we had to take off the top.  The scent is fair, and the soap isn&#x27;t creamy and hydrating.  I will not purchase this again.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this product and it works well with my sensitive skin. The design of the packaging could be improved - the body wash does not flow easily out of the cap, which makes showering less time efficient. Overall, it is a good value for the money, but I may end up putting it in a different bottle for use of use.</li>
            <li> It has that fresh, pungent, earthy, green sharp smell of a farm-fresh cucumber.  Not perfumy or sweet or combined with a fruit fragrance like most of the other brands.  I&#x27;m not a connoisseur on how bath soaps and gels are supposed to work and feel, but I&#x27;d rate it &amp;#34;impressive&amp;#34;.  I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
            <li> does a good job cleansing with making me itch. smells good, a little expenseive on line used to get it at&lt;br /&gt;walgreens buy one get one they quite carrying it. so did ulta and bed, bath and beyond</li>
            <li> Best body wash ever!  Clean scent ans super sudsy!  I have tried many other natural soaps and body washes, and none of the other sulfite or parabin free washes even come close!  Will definitly by more.  Also shipping was very fast.  Super pleased!</li>
            <li> I love the clean scent and it works well, plus it is cruelty free and a fair price, it doesn&#x27;t get any better.  I will definitely order more and probably try a few other products in this line.</li>
            <li> Could not find this product in any store in my area. Decided to look on Amazon and here it is..&lt;br /&gt;This product is so great smelling and fabulous on the body.</li>
            <li> Wanting to switch to more natural health &amp; beauty products, I purchased this shower gel.  I LOVE IT!!  It makes my skin feel very soft and healthy and the scent is wonderfully clean and invigorating.  The only problem I&#x27;ve found: my daughters love it too and it&#x27;s getting used up too quickly!  Still, it&#x27;s a good value for the price and quality, so we will be purchasing more!</li>
            <li> This is honestly the best body wash I&#x27;ve ever used. It smells so refreshing, lathers really well, and leaves my skin feeling soft and clean afterwards. And it&#x27;s 95% natural! Love it!&lt;br /&gt;As an added bonus, because it isn&#x27;t overtly fruity or floral, it&#x27;s the bodywash choice for me and my boyfriend! No more his and hers soap needed in my apartment &#x3D; less bathroom clutter.</li>
            <li> I like the smell.  Its not too strong and doesn&#x27;t have that overpowering floral smell that a lot of body washes have.  Its almost soothing.</li>
            <li> Not 5 stars onky bc i;dont like the smell anymore. I will try other YesTo products</li>
            <li> Love the Yes to Carrots Brand. Leaves me feeling clean and fresh without excessive soap residue. Lathers just right, and very affordable with an adequate amount for the price.</li>
            <li> I have been SLS free for 9 months and this is my favorite shower gel by far! It smells terrific (not floral and  not strong) feels terrific (like silk) and lathers well. It is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li> Love the way my skin feels after using this and love the cucumber scent.</li>
            <li> I try to stick to natural products, or those who have a low impact on the earth.  Yes to Cucumbers is a newer brand that I&#x27;ve been seeing (there&#x27;s also yes to carrots and other veggies out there) so I decided to give it a try.  I liked it and it was natural, and an all around pretty good product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes To Cucumbers advertises itself as being a calming shower gel.  I never really have irrated skin so I can&#x27;t say whether or not this gel actually calms and soothes irritated skin, but it certainly didn&#x27;t cause new irritation for me.  Nor did feel any kind of soothing sensation.  But what it does do is gets you clean.  I use about a nickel sized amount on a shower poof during my showers and that was sufficient to work up a good lather and more, I probably could have gotten away with using a smaller amount.  But that&#x27;s ok, even using that much this shower gel has lasted me over five months, so it&#x27;s a good deal.  It also worked pretty well as bath bubbles, a little bit squeezed into a bathtub made a nice soft layer of bubbles.  I would definitely say that this is not an exfoliating product.  It doesn&#x27;t have the grit or the ingredients to do that.  It is simply a cleansing product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients were good.  According to the bottle, 99.8% of this product is natural.  And it&#x27;s paraben-free.  There were a couple ingredients I couldn&#x27;t pronounce, but for a bath product, this had a relatively short list of ingredients.  The fragrance ingredient was merely listed as fragrance though, so I&#x27;m not sure what scents this product.  Which leads me to the next point.  The only thing I could really complain about is that it doesn&#x27;t have a very strong smell.  I would have liked to actually smell the cucumbers and while there is a barely discernible flowery smell, there&#x27;s not that cucumber smell for me.  Of course this might work well for someone who would rather use a scented lotion after bathing instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A decent shower gel.  I&#x27;ll keep trying other ones as I like new things, but this is one I&#x27;d consider using again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Review by M. Reynard 2012I like new things, but this is one I&#x27;d consider using again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Review by M. Reynard 2012</li>
            <li> I used to use Dove soap because &amp;#34;ordinary&amp;#34; soap, i.e. Ivory, both dried my skin and left a waxy feeling on it.  I thought for the longest time that Dove didn&#x27;t leave any residue, until I started using this stuff (with a loofah).  It doesn&#x27;t actually feel like soap at all; it&#x27;s more like extra-clean water (and with a very pleasant scent too).  My skin feels more like skin afterwards, if that makes any sense.</li>
            <li> The smell is great while using, but barely perceptible after getting out of the shower.  My skin has started to clear up after only a few weeks of use.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great, and works even better.  I was constantly itching during these months where the temps go up and down, but haven&#x27;t since I started using this.  It&#x27;s a different feel of clean, than traditional soaps, but it&#x27;s a good feel.  The cucumber is very calming, and it helps calm me at the end of a stressful day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again, and highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This product is dangerous. The first time I used it I washed my face with it and it stung my eyes like crazy. I decided to use it only on my body because it was pleasant smelling and I paid so much for it.  Tonight I washed my son with it and it splashed in my eye. It was horribly painful and I am not a wimp. I couldn&#x27;t even open my eye to flush it out. It&#x27;s been 30 minutes and I&#x27;m finally feeling some relief. My eye however - is still beet red. This is truly just too dangerous to use, especially with kids! I bought it because I wanted something natural and safe, but this backfired. I hope to goodness they didn&#x27;t test this on animals. Any drip into the eye and OW!</li>
            <li> I love the smell and my skin feels so soft. My husband even likes this and he doesn&#x27;t like anything but Zest!! Lol</li>
            <li> Hardly no suds. Seems diluted.</li>
            <li> I loved the smell of the fresh cucumbers, but it did not work well for me. I broke out in a slight rash both times using it. Also, I eat fresh cucumbers just fine and use cucumber face soaps. Like anything, some people react to certain products and some do not.</li>
            <li> Product is good. I sometimes use it to wash my hair and also use as shaving cream. After going thru a few of them I&#x27;ve found the cap to be defective in that it won&#x27;t fully open and so I keep the cap off.</li>
            <li> This body wash lathers like crazy, smells like cucumbers (good!), and leaves the skin feeling smooth and fresh. HOWEVER, it has two big problems that will keep me from ordering it again:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The dispenser lid does not work at all! I have to unscrew the whole cap, and then too much product pours out. Plus, it&#x27;s a pain to do. I have arthritic hands so that&#x27;s part of the problem, but it really is difficult to do (you have to squeeze the whole bottle really hard to get any to come out, and then only a tiny bit comes out), and I think it would be difficult for most anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. It stings and burns mucous membranes, which do get suds on them in the normal process of washing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So... good product inside bottle but very bad dispenser.</li>
            <li> As others have mentioned, you can&#x27;t get the product to dispense at all, and you have to completely remove the top and pour it out.  A hassle in the shower.  I won&#x27;t buy this body wash again for this one reason.  Secondary to that, however, is the absence of scent.  I have a very keen &amp;#34;smeller&amp;#34; (TOO keen sometimes!  LOL), but I can BARELY smell any cucumber in this stuff.  Disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, this body wash does seem mild and does not irritate my sensitive, rosacea-prone skin.  But there are better products out there for sensitive skin that have much more user-friendly dispenser caps.</li>
            <li> Smells good, feels good, does good to my skin and I know it contains natural ingredients! what else would you want?!</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great and is gentle on my sensitive skin. I highly recommend this body wash to everyone. Promise you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> This is a good body wash but I don&#x27;t love the scent.</li>
            <li> A very nice body wash that leaves your skin feeling and looking great.</li>
            <li> Smells really yummy I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> awesome body wash - smells good and makes the skin feel very soft. :)</li>
            <li> No issues with dryness on this wash. I liked the smell and the lather was normal. I disliked how hard i had to squeeze to get the body wash out of the container. Thanks for the strength conditioning every morning!</li>
            <li> I used this for the first time after reading a recommendation and I will be purchasing some for gift baskets for birthdays and special occasions.  Plan on trying some other scents too.</li>
            <li> I have not had any awful breakouts from this body wash. I don&#x27;t use it on my face but my chest will breakout if I try to use a very scented wash. I don&#x27;t have to use moisturizer as often if I don&#x27;t want to so I guess it also helps hydrate my skin as well. The cucumber smell is fine. Not bad &amp; doesn&#x27;t linger either. I&#x27;d recommend &amp; buy again.</li>
            <li> I read about this product in two different magazines &amp; searched all the local stores in my area but couldn&#x27;t find it. Finally ordered it through Amazon &amp; it is a disappointment. The scent doesn&#x27;t last on the skin &amp; it doesn&#x27;t work any better than Suave or Caress. Both Olay &amp; Dove outperform this product. Waste of money....won&#x27;t be buying it again :(</li>
            <li> Watery, poor scent, and leaves you feeling like you need to take another shower after using it.  Would never buy again.</li>
            <li> As a guy that is constantly working out and sweating either from the gym or work, this body wash really helps clear up my skin. No manly scent here but after using this bottle for 3 months its completely cleaned up my chest and back. I don&#x27;t use it anymore but when winter comes and if my skin starts drying out I will be back! Add in a few drops of tea tree oil, not too much cause the scent is strong, and I guarantee you&#x27;ll love this product.</li>
