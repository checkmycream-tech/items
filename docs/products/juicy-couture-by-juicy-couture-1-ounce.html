            <li>I love sweet perfumes, I was skeptical in ordering a perfume based on the reviews, but it turned out that I love it!!</li>
            <li>it was delivered very fast.  </li>
            <li>this was exactly what was in the store.</li>
            <li>You get MAYBE one short spray after pushing it 4-5 or more times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>foir the scent, it is really pretty....</li>

            <li>This review has nothing to do with the shipper themselves, my order was processed and shipped to me in a very timely manner, and for that I do appreciate it.</li>
            <li>Just enough for me on my special days.  </li>
            <li>Probably something to do with skin chemistry, but it stunk to high heaven on me.  </li>
            <li>The pump is a little cheap.</li>
            <li>Came quick, I think the smell may be just slightly off</li>
            <li>but a little dab-a-do-ya..and the dry down is really nice..</li>
            <li>I thought it smelled sweet and heavy, but it did lasted a long time.</li>

            <li> Very cute bottle &amp; smells like flowers. Great for young teens &amp; young adults.</li>
            <li> No complaints, very good service..</li>
            <li> took a while and was not exactly what I was expecting</li>
            <li> i smelled this in a clothing store. and loved it. this was exactly what was in the store. for me, i cant put on alot. it totally messes with my sinuses. but a little dab-a-do-ya..and the dry down is really nice..</li>
            <li> Great perfume at a great price!</li>
            <li> Came quick, I think the smell may be just slightly off but it still smells delicious!!! Love it!</li>
            <li> Bought it for my girl friend and she loved it so much she used it all up in over a month jaja</li>
            <li> Item delivered on time, was as described,</li>
            <li> I bought this because my granddaughter used it and liked it.  Well, she got one more bottle to use!  On me, it had a very offensive odor.  Probably something to do with skin chemistry, but it stunk to high heaven on me.  Try before you buy.  (Or just go back to the wonderful White Diamonds that always smells wonderful.)</li>
            <li> First of all, the dispenser that my order came with STINKS.  It is a terrible pump that doesn&#x27;t work well at all.  You get MAYBE one short spray after pushing it 4-5 or more times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As foir the scent, it is really pretty....HOWEVER, it doesn&#x27;t last more than 1/2 hour (if you&#x27;re lucky).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d buy another bottle; especially given the price.</li>
            <li> I  had gotten a sample strip in the store not realizing that it was the viva la juicy instead of juicy couture.  The saleswoman said it was &amp;#34;Juicy&amp;#34; perfume and I did not realize at the time that there were various ones.  The price for this perfume was great and the service of this seller was terrific I just was not so nuts about the smell of this perfume.</li>
            <li> When I ordered this the price was $12ish n now it&#x27;s $8ish. I was skeptical but after reading the reviews I was comfortable. Great price. Misleading picture. I got a travel bottle. Smells great but not what I thought I bought. Now i understand the price. The pump is a little cheap. I looked it up to make sure it wasn&#x27;t fake and it was legit. However I feel what&#x27;s pictured is false advertisement. Nobody else mentioned it in their reviews. But again smells great, it&#x27;s the real deal, cheap great price! Just not what&#x27;s pictured. Otherwise it would of been 5 stars!</li>
            <li> It has met and then exceeded my expectations. Love this perfume.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Just enough for me on my special days.  Makes me feel like a wanted women?!</li>
            <li> Delivery was fast.. It was just what I asked for...fragrance is wonderful.</li>
            <li> best smell, best price..never ever miss it great gift for any girl...a MUST BUY PRODUCT...i bought it for my sister and she went crazy over this</li>
            <li> Great Smell, delivered on time</li>
            <li> it was delivered very fast.  I love sweet perfumes, I was skeptical in ordering a perfume based on the reviews, but it turned out that I love it!!</li>
            <li> The reason I only gave it two stars is because I ordered Juicy Couture by Juicy, however i received a different perfume instead. I didn&#x27;t have the time to return the wrong perfume and get the correct one, and I wound up liking the one i got, however its frustrating not receiving what you paid for.</li>
            <li> I ordered this on a whim, hearing from friends and reading the reviews of how great the scent is. To each his own, but to me it&#x27;s entirely overpowering and horribly old lady/floral smelling. This review has nothing to do with the shipper themselves, my order was processed and shipped to me in a very timely manner, and for that I do appreciate it. Not to mention the cost was great for the amount you&#x27;re given. But I will definitely be pawning this perfume off on someone else, or try to sell it.</li>
            <li> authentic &amp; fast shipping</li>
            <li> My daughter wanted this for Christmas. It was significantly less expensive here on Amazon. She loves it.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is okay, my husband liked it better than I did. I thought it smelled sweet and heavy, but it did lasted a long time.</li>
            <li> I just love this fragrance!</li>
