            <li>but it&#x27;s nice to plump them up a bit.</li>
            <li>Also using the toothbrush technic and the rose salve lip balm that I too got on here on amazon.</li>
            <li>Make SURE to apply a good Chapstick...</li>
            <li>Kind of like Michelle Pfeiffer&#x27;s lips.</li>
            <li>The product came in nicely rapped</li>
            <li>I ordered the combo pack, because I really wasn&#x27;t sure what size or shape  would be best for me.</li>
            <li>Very nice, full lips indeed.</li>
            <li>This is the best lip plumper I used so far.</li>
            <li>Stay young and happy!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s SO easy to use too!</li>
            <li>Firstly, the seller is so great.</li>
            <li>Loved the sweet packaging.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very comfortable when used correctly,</li>
            <li>The lip enhancer is super cool and does work!!!</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS.</li>
            <li>Your better off using something at home shape in this form and shape.</li>
            <li>I would love to let her know how grateful I was for that</li>
            <li>Each time I use it, it works better and better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad they did sent it to me</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>and I think I have medium size lips, but I think the seller will send you all 3 for free!</li>
            <li>I love love love these lip enhancers.</li>
            <li>I got a lip liner with it &amp; the packaging was cute with a letter.</li>
            <li>&amp; she&#x27;s in love with this product because it gives her the fuller lips</li>
            <li>There are so many videos showing you how to use it</li>
            <li>so I started to play with more looks.</li>
            <li>I love playing with these</li>
            <li>The packaging was really cute.</li>
            <li>It works just as stated and the seller (Linda) is FANTASTIC!</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t feel confident that it would work.</li>
            <li>&#x3D;)</li>
            <li>and it expanded the time 2 more hours.</li>
            <li>Every time I see someone use this in a video, they make it seem like you put it on your mouth, where it magically creates a suction that has to be pried off, and boom: fuller lips.</li>
            <li>Sure.</li>
            <li>Do you want to feel sexy?</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to pay thousands of dollars just for getting what you want in sexy lips--just pay about $40:00</li>
            <li>I love these lip plumper.</li>
            <li>Love that she included a lip liner in the package.</li>
            <li>I bought fullips a couple months ago and have been using it most days.</li>
            <li>The customer service for this store is great and they respond fast if you have any questions.</li>
            <li>so I focused on my top lip</li>
            <li>most heart reached out women.</li>
            <li>I love love love this product.</li>
            <li>love it love</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this.</li>
            <li>This creates a much better &#x27;seal&#x27;.</li>
            <li>Officially in love with this product.</li>
            <li>Crappy, cheap product marketed by a bunch of bullies!</li>
            <li>Thankyou for making such an awesome product I love it.</li>
            <li>Love these.  </li>
            <li>This actually works it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>Very excited when I saw I got 3 sizes instead of 2 plus a lip liner and lip brush when I opened up my package.</li>
            <li>but so far so good!</li>
            <li>So caring and sweet and created a product that she&#x27;s passionate about and gives her customers the most amazing customer service I&#x27;ve ever experienced!</li>
            <li>Not for hours, but It will give you a nice, full, plump lip for 30-45 minutes.  </li>
            <li>I got the pack and let founder Linda about how if would be nice to have all three to get the full benefit even one can do</li>
            <li>I was so excited when I recieved my fullips!</li>
            <li>Item arrived quickly and it was packaged nicely.</li>
            <li>Love love and love all three enhancers work great for different plumping.</li>
            <li>But other then that I&#x27;m sure once I get the hang of it it will be flawless</li>
            <li>I thought it was great that they informed me and that someone contacted me directly.</li>
            <li>The perfect nude pink.  </li>
            <li>so im excited to play more</li>
            <li>Ordered two and received the full set instead!</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for something to get those full Kylie Jenner lips, this is the product for you!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t work well at all or easily either.</li>
            <li>The instruction card was personally signed by her and the packaging was so beautifully done.</li>
            <li>Great product and the owner is as sweet and professional as can be.</li>
            <li>She shipped the items quickly and gave me a bunch of freebies!</li>
            <li>Really work, &amp; I received 2 free gifts with purchase!!</li>
            <li>I will send a picture soon this is the real deal love it! :-</li>
            <li>Easy to use, easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Not only is Fullips very reasonably priced but the product itself is SO MUCH more beautiful and polished.</li>
            <li>I noticed a huge difference.</li>
            <li>My lips are huge now and stay tha way for about four hours.</li>
            <li>The seller does an amazing job of making you feel you&#x27;re appreciated as a customer.</li>
            <li>Really liked this it enhances your lips as much</li>
            <li>The smallest one I cant fit my lips in</li>
            <li>This is great for a moment, I don&#x27;t know if its the same for everyone.</li>
            <li>but once you become comfortable with it, it works wonders.</li>
            <li>It also comes with detailed instructions.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see how this will fit anybody&#x27;s lips.</li>
            <li>Great product when used properly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s important to note how you want your lips plumped...</li>
            <li>So when I&#x27;m sucking, I kind of gently pull the plumper in a downward motion to make them fuller underneath...</li>
            <li>Secondly, this is a great product.</li>
            <li>I have to practice using this product, but so far so good.</li>
            <li>The larger more rounded one is good to not both lips in...</li>
            <li>Still fairly new at using the product but thanks to all the great tips I should be a pro in no time at all</li>
            <li>My order came in about 2 days which was awesome because I was anxious to try them.</li>
            <li>I was too excited</li>
            <li>Totally practical and thought it was so sweet of the sender to include a beautiful complimentary lip liner.</li>
            <li>:) and I definitely felt more confident after using them.</li>
            <li>These plumped my lips up right away, were super easy to use, and did not hurt one bit.  </li>
            <li>thats ok, but i need to used so much for the result</li>
            <li>The packaging is so sweet</li>
            <li>I have full lips to begin with</li>
            <li>This is my wish come true.</li>
            <li>I work with it to create a full even lips.</li>
            <li>I find that to not be true in my case.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s best to start slow.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li>This really does work and the more you do it, the fuller they stay for longer.</li>
            <li>So sweet.</li>
            <li>but this one is gentle and safe.</li>
            <li>I only ordered the 2-pack, and she sent me all 3 PLUS an exfoliation brush AND this gorgeous lip liner in maple.</li>
            <li>and one more thing..shipping was super fast.</li>
            <li>so I thought the large round plumper would be my best bet</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great works very well , the only thing is I have full lips</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fun to play around with these little guys to see what my ideal fullness is.  </li>
            <li>I just tried the enhancers quickly</li>
            <li>Great alternative to lip injections or to see if you really want larger lips before committing to injections.</li>
            <li>First of all I got it super quick after I ordered it!</li>
            <li>If you use it without moisturizing on and around your lips, you will find that you will lose your suction quickly and let&#x27;s face it...</li>
            <li>It will quickly fade.</li>
            <li>Also, a swipe of lip-gloss quickly resolves that nuisance.</li>
            <li>and she answered so quickly.</li>
            <li>It looks great while its puffed, but it goes down too soon.</li>
            <li>These are my new favorite thing.  </li>
            <li>&amp; when you follow the instructions &amp; use them safely &amp; slowly, your lips become fuller, more plump, &amp; all around amazing!</li>
            <li>but I guess by the preassure my bottom lip was blistered twice and didn&#x27;t even do that much suction or time because I wanted to take it easy.</li>
            <li>The product came very quickly and very well packaged.  </li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t write reviews but this one was very well deserving of one.</li>
            <li>I would recommend her if you want big sexy lips!</li>
            <li>and it did exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>So Worth the Money</li>
            <li>It was fun using it.</li>
            <li>I had an issue with the post office losing my first package,and I contacted Linda, and she was so sweet in replacing my package.</li>
            <li>And naturally plumping, but the most of all that truly does work is Fullips Lip Plumbing Enhancer.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this is worth it.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s pretty cool to have if your against lip fillers.</li>
            <li>Also most importantly the owner is such a doll!!</li>
            <li>Thanks so much!!!</li>
            <li>It is temporary as it tells you but they can tend to leave a hicky type ring around the top lip if your not careful!!</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;m not doing it right.</li>
            <li>these three little guys gives me nice plumpy lips!</li>
            <li>I have used it several times and it works good for about 20-30 minutes, after that my lips turn back to its original size.  </li>
            <li>I will certainly be returning this ASAP!</li>
            <li>I can get a good result but it lasts less time than it took me to plump...</li>
            <li>My bottom lip is ask ready pretty full</li>
            <li>Loved putting on lipstick and having a upper lip to work with normally my lipstick would just be a straight line.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a fan of Michelle Phan on youtube and she mentions Fullips and using it mainly on one of her youtube videos on achieving full luscious lips.</li>
            <li>The packaged is so cute and thanks for the little gift :)</li>
            <li>, I finally after many reviews purchased the 2-pack.</li>
            <li>I recieved a email from a representative of Fulllips sating that they would be sending the 3rd one completely free!</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>But the truth is this product would be gold if was able to last 3hrs like it is said to do.  </li>
            <li>I love my plumpers but it doesn&#x27;t last hours like the reviews.</li>
            <li>So when I did finally receive them I was also sent a free additional lip enhancer and a lip liner!</li>
            <li>They really do work!</li>
            <li>the first time she used it, it bruised her lips.</li>
            <li>Y&#x27;all go above &amp; beyond customer service showing so much love.</li>
            <li>At first, I could not use it.</li>
            <li>The product is very temporary but fun to play with-full lip effect lasts 30 mins max.</li>
            <li>These arrived really fast and work like a charm!  </li>
            <li>They really do work!</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>Fast delivery!  </li>
            <li>Linda, I want to thank you too for supporting charities and your the kindest AND</li>
            <li>I really like this product!</li>
            <li>I can only hope with continued use it will work even better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve included a picture of my first attempt but with practice now</li>
            <li>I can get them bigger and more shapely.</li>
            <li>If done properly, it&#x27;s actually quite healthy to keep the blood circulating to your lips.</li>
            <li>Thanks Linda!</li>
            <li>I think the more you use it the longer the results last (meaning consecutive days, not meaning keep it on for an hour).</li>
            <li>I would absolutely suggest this to a friend!</li>
            <li>... on my first try my lips looked plumped up</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a non-filler, non-invasive, fun and easy way of temporarily getting some of the fullness  in my lips that I had when I was younger</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t use it very frequently to get the full benefit of it.</li>
            <li>She sent me a cute little letter with the invoice with a free gift attach.</li>
            <li>I received a quick and friendly response back.</li>
            <li>Thank you Linda for the extra special gifts, and for the opportunity to have a glimpse at what it&#x27;s like with full lips.</li>
            <li>I would say it&#x27;s great for maybe 40-50 sec before it&#x27;s much smaller.</li>
            <li>but this is a great way to add some subtle oomph (Or not-so-subtle if you choose).</li>
            <li>It looks great at first, but it only lasts about a half hour.</li>
            <li>last too long but looks good</li>
            <li>Gentle enough not to leave a huge ring around your mouth.</li>
            <li>want to thank Linda for taking the time to write personally and taking the time of a huge thank you card.</li>
            <li>Fast and credibility of Connecting</li>
            <li>Thank you so much.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these beauties!</li>
            <li>lips were a tad tender by the end of the first day but all was normal</li>
            <li>It really depends on the size of your mouth/lips.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend this product!</li>
            <li>even if used for a short amount of time with light to medium suction.</li>
            <li>Did not benefit me much.</li>
            <li>are so short-lived that I don&#x27;t see  using it much.</li>
            <li>My lips look and feel very plump after using this.</li>
            <li>it really plumps up my lips...</li>
            <li>I watched the video which was very helpful.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much</li>
            <li>effects wear off fairly fast.  </li>
            <li>however, much cheaper than injections.</li>
            <li>I got three fullips and they through in a lip pencil which was really nice and not cheap looking.</li>
            <li>If you follow the instructions that are clearly spelled out in the most simple way, you WILL see results.</li>
            <li>my lips ended up being to big for the medium which I originally ordered.</li>
            <li>I personally don&#x27;t need it much because I already have full lips</li>
            <li>Worked great just didn&#x27;t last on me for no more then 45min that sucked.</li>
            <li>It takes a little practice but once you get it down your good to go!</li>
            <li>I used the small and the large round, and didn&#x27;t have much use for the medium size, so I gave it away as a gift the person who received it, loved it!</li>
            <li>I only ordered two, but the seller send an extra one for free!</li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to have Linda see my comment and send me an email.</li>
            <li>Ladies, we are not getting any younger-we gradually lose the fullness of our lips when we get older</li>
            <li>product itself is very simple and provides quick results.</li>
            <li>but I actually think the ovals work better because they only suction my lips, not the skin around my lips.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and purchase.</li>
            <li>The owner also sent cute little girts with the plumpers.</li>
            <li>It arrived a day earlier than the first day of estimated arrival!</li>
            <li>I was hoping for something a little better.  </li>
            <li>I really love both the large and small oval shaped ones and have found that I can get a pouty bottom lip and even a defined &amp;#34;Cupids-bow&amp;#34; when in reality I do not have a defined cupids bow.  </li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;ve used the large round the most.</li>
            <li>There are a lot of similar things surfacing right now</li>
            <li>Everyone tells me how much they love my lips, they all thought I was using some type of lip gloss to make them look full, I had to share my new secret!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without now.</li>
            <li>then I new MY pressure point.</li>
            <li>Included an extra lip plumper (so it was 3 total) and free lip pencil gift-great vendor.</li>
            <li>At first the effects only lasted a few minutes but the longer and more frequently I use this product the longer my lips stay plump</li>
            <li>But lets be honest......if you meet someone with those lips, be prepared to explain the change later on.  ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The 2 smaller ones are really better for doing one lip at a time which I PREFER because my upper lip is smaller than my bottom lip.</li>
            <li>First off, let me say this: anybody who buys this with expectation that this is a permanent solution obviously has no clue how to read and comorehend.</li>
            <li>I was curious what it would look like for both lips to be equally full.</li>
            <li>You may get a red ring above or below your lips, but this will quickly fade.</li>
            <li>They showed up in a very pretty red satchel/bag with a red satin draw ribbon</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t last all day, but certainly for hours.</li>
            <li>If you want a little more &amp;#34;va-va-voom&amp;#34; to that pucker, simply repeat the process.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s awsome that something like this is out there and makes your lips look naturally bigger and is much cheaper than lip injections which, never look natural.</li>
            <li>As far as my opinion on how it works..</li>
            <li>Secondly, my lips didn&#x27;t plump all that much.</li>
            <li>and I was very presently surprised).  </li>
            <li>Wow how can that happen without injections?</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t overdo it and use it to subtly give life to your lips it is a great product for those who just want a little non-aggressive</li>
            <li>The other one was nowhere worth the price</li>
            <li>would recommend this mainly to girls with smaller lips.</li>
            <li>The small size is nice if you want to focus on the center of your lips.</li>
            <li>As we get older, our lips get smaller and the lip color starts to recede.</li>
            <li>The first day I played with all of the sizes and found that the round suction works well for me to do the &amp;#34;cherub&amp;#34; look since I already have full lips but due to age lines they have lost the natural plump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the next normal</li>
            <li>Not only did it come with a free little gift it also came with a note providing helpful care instructions.</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m sure if you are reading social media you are hearing about these young kids attempting to use shot glasses to try this method with not good results.</li>
            <li>sometimes I forget I&#x27;m wearing it although I do get impatient because I want it to work quickly.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m too scared to go extreme, but they really do make a difference in your pout! ....</li>
            <li>Lastly, the instruction card had my name and a friendly little note hand written in</li>
            <li>Please be very careful when doing this, and take your time, because if for the first time you&#x27;re trying this, you rush it</li>
            <li>so the small and oval don&#x27;t fit over my lips so if you have full lips already just get the round big one .</li>
            <li>(I hesitate to even call it a nuisance, as it barely qualifies as one.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Seriously, my lips look so full and lush.</li>
            <li>The results are exactly what I expected!!!</li>
            <li>So impressed would recommend to anybody with thin lips who are wanting fast non painful fuller lips.</li>
            <li>First few times I used it, my lips stayed plump about an hour, however over time of continued use my lips have stayed plump longer.</li>
            <li>I get that it &amp;#34;could&amp;#34; last longer over time, but it took so long to get them just slightly plump that it just isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li>which is ceylon cinnamon which has more benefits and different from other common grocery store cinnamon.</li>
            <li>A few minutes at best :(</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s full potential, but slowly my pout disappeared within the hour.</li>
            <li>I paid for the Large Round &amp; Medium Oval and it came with the Small Oval as well as a little toothbrush for lip exfoliation and a nude lip liner that I really love, plus instructions.</li>
            <li>The shipping and the customer service was EXCELLENT, but i was very disappointed with the product.</li>
            <li>Each lip enhancer was in it&#x27;s own clear box and the company even included a small red tooth-brush (I&#x27;m assuming to exfoliate the lips to remove all of the rough, dead skin on the lips) AND (bonus), a lip liner (I line my lips and then use the liner for my lip color as well), that has a lip brush on the other end.  </li>

            <li> Also using the toothbrush technic and the rose salve lip balm that I too got on here on amazon.</li>
            <li> Make SURE to apply a good Chapstick...</li>
            <li> Kind of like Michelle Pfeiffer&#x27;s lips.</li>
            <li> The product came in nicely rapped</li>
            <li> I ordered the combo pack, because I really wasn&#x27;t sure what size or shape  would be best for me.</li>
            <li> Very nice, full lips indeed.</li>
            <li> This is the best lip plumper I used so far.</li>
            <li> Stay young and happy!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s SO easy to use too!</li>
            <li> Firstly, the seller is so great.</li>
            <li> Loved the sweet packaging.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very comfortable when used correctly,</li>
            <li> The lip enhancer is super cool and does work!!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS.</li>
            <li> Your better off using something at home shape in this form and shape.</li>
            <li> I would love to let her know how grateful I was for that</li>
            <li> Each time I use it, it works better and better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad they did sent it to me</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> and I think I have medium size lips, but I think the seller will send you all 3 for free!</li>
            <li> I love love love these lip enhancers.</li>
            <li> I got a lip liner with it &amp; the packaging was cute with a letter.</li>
            <li> &amp; she&#x27;s in love with this product because it gives her the fuller lips</li>
            <li> There are so many videos showing you how to use it</li>
            <li> so I started to play with more looks.</li>
            <li> I love playing with these</li>
            <li> The packaging was really cute.</li>
            <li> It works just as stated and the seller (Linda) is FANTASTIC!</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t feel confident that it would work.</li>
            <li> &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> and it expanded the time 2 more hours.</li>
            <li> Every time I see someone use this in a video, they make it seem like you put it on your mouth, where it magically creates a suction that has to be pried off, and boom: fuller lips.</li>
            <li> Sure.</li>
            <li> Do you want to feel sexy?</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to pay thousands of dollars just for getting what you want in sexy lips--just pay about $40:00</li>
            <li> I love these lip plumper.</li>
            <li> Love that she included a lip liner in the package.</li>
            <li> I bought fullips a couple months ago and have been using it most days.</li>
            <li> The customer service for this store is great and they respond fast if you have any questions.</li>
            <li> so I focused on my top lip</li>
            <li> most heart reached out women.</li>
            <li> I love love love this product.</li>
            <li> love it love</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this.</li>
            <li> This creates a much better &#x27;seal&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Officially in love with this product.</li>
            <li> Crappy, cheap product marketed by a bunch of bullies!</li>
            <li> Thankyou for making such an awesome product I love it.</li>
            <li> Love these.  </li>
            <li> This actually works it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> Very excited when I saw I got 3 sizes instead of 2 plus a lip liner and lip brush when I opened up my package.</li>
            <li> but so far so good!</li>
            <li> So caring and sweet and created a product that she&#x27;s passionate about and gives her customers the most amazing customer service I&#x27;ve ever experienced!</li>
            <li> Not for hours, but It will give you a nice, full, plump lip for 30-45 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I got the pack and let founder Linda about how if would be nice to have all three to get the full benefit even one can do</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I recieved my fullips!</li>
            <li> Item arrived quickly and it was packaged nicely.</li>
            <li> Love love and love all three enhancers work great for different plumping.</li>
            <li> But other then that I&#x27;m sure once I get the hang of it it will be flawless</li>
            <li> I thought it was great that they informed me and that someone contacted me directly.</li>
            <li> The perfect nude pink.  </li>
            <li> so im excited to play more</li>
            <li> Ordered two and received the full set instead!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for something to get those full Kylie Jenner lips, this is the product for you!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work well at all or easily either.</li>
            <li> The instruction card was personally signed by her and the packaging was so beautifully done.</li>
            <li> Great product and the owner is as sweet and professional as can be.</li>
            <li> She shipped the items quickly and gave me a bunch of freebies!</li>
            <li> Really work, &amp; I received 2 free gifts with purchase!!</li>
            <li> I will send a picture soon this is the real deal love it! :-</li>
            <li> Easy to use, easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Not only is Fullips very reasonably priced but the product itself is SO MUCH more beautiful and polished.</li>
            <li> I noticed a huge difference.</li>
            <li> My lips are huge now and stay tha way for about four hours.</li>
            <li> The seller does an amazing job of making you feel you&#x27;re appreciated as a customer.</li>
            <li> Really liked this it enhances your lips as much</li>
            <li> The smallest one I cant fit my lips in</li>
            <li> This is great for a moment, I don&#x27;t know if its the same for everyone.</li>
            <li> but once you become comfortable with it, it works wonders.</li>
            <li> It also comes with detailed instructions.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see how this will fit anybody&#x27;s lips.</li>
            <li> Great product when used properly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s important to note how you want your lips plumped...</li>
            <li> So when I&#x27;m sucking, I kind of gently pull the plumper in a downward motion to make them fuller underneath...</li>
            <li> Secondly, this is a great product.</li>
            <li> I have to practice using this product, but so far so good.</li>
            <li> The larger more rounded one is good to not both lips in...</li>
            <li> Still fairly new at using the product but thanks to all the great tips I should be a pro in no time at all</li>
            <li> My order came in about 2 days which was awesome because I was anxious to try them.</li>
            <li> I was too excited</li>
            <li> Totally practical and thought it was so sweet of the sender to include a beautiful complimentary lip liner.</li>
            <li> :) and I definitely felt more confident after using them.</li>
            <li> These plumped my lips up right away, were super easy to use, and did not hurt one bit.  </li>
            <li> thats ok, but i need to used so much for the result</li>
            <li> The packaging is so sweet</li>
            <li> I have full lips to begin with</li>
            <li> This is my wish come true.</li>
            <li> I work with it to create a full even lips.</li>
            <li> I find that to not be true in my case.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s best to start slow.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li> This really does work and the more you do it, the fuller they stay for longer.</li>
            <li> So sweet.</li>
            <li> but this one is gentle and safe.</li>
            <li> I only ordered the 2-pack, and she sent me all 3 PLUS an exfoliation brush AND this gorgeous lip liner in maple.</li>
            <li> and one more thing..shipping was super fast.</li>
            <li> so I thought the large round plumper would be my best bet</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great works very well , the only thing is I have full lips</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fun to play around with these little guys to see what my ideal fullness is.  </li>
            <li> I just tried the enhancers quickly</li>
            <li> Great alternative to lip injections or to see if you really want larger lips before committing to injections.</li>
            <li> First of all I got it super quick after I ordered it!</li>
            <li> If you use it without moisturizing on and around your lips, you will find that you will lose your suction quickly and let&#x27;s face it...</li>
            <li> It will quickly fade.</li>
            <li> Also, a swipe of lip-gloss quickly resolves that nuisance.</li>
            <li> and she answered so quickly.</li>
            <li> It looks great while its puffed, but it goes down too soon.</li>
            <li> These are my new favorite thing.  </li>
            <li> &amp; when you follow the instructions &amp; use them safely &amp; slowly, your lips become fuller, more plump, &amp; all around amazing!</li>
            <li> but I guess by the preassure my bottom lip was blistered twice and didn&#x27;t even do that much suction or time because I wanted to take it easy.</li>
            <li> The product came very quickly and very well packaged.  </li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t write reviews but this one was very well deserving of one.</li>
            <li> I would recommend her if you want big sexy lips!</li>
            <li> and it did exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> So Worth the Money</li>
            <li> It was fun using it.</li>
            <li> I had an issue with the post office losing my first package,and I contacted Linda, and she was so sweet in replacing my package.</li>
            <li> And naturally plumping, but the most of all that truly does work is Fullips Lip Plumbing Enhancer.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is worth it.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s pretty cool to have if your against lip fillers.</li>
            <li> Also most importantly the owner is such a doll!!</li>
            <li> Thanks so much!!!</li>
            <li> It is temporary as it tells you but they can tend to leave a hicky type ring around the top lip if your not careful!!</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m not doing it right.</li>
            <li> these three little guys gives me nice plumpy lips!</li>
            <li> I have used it several times and it works good for about 20-30 minutes, after that my lips turn back to its original size.  </li>
            <li> I will certainly be returning this ASAP!</li>
            <li> I can get a good result but it lasts less time than it took me to plump...</li>
            <li> My bottom lip is ask ready pretty full</li>
            <li> Loved putting on lipstick and having a upper lip to work with normally my lipstick would just be a straight line.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fan of Michelle Phan on youtube and she mentions Fullips and using it mainly on one of her youtube videos on achieving full luscious lips.</li>
            <li> The packaged is so cute and thanks for the little gift :)</li>
            <li> , I finally after many reviews purchased the 2-pack.</li>
            <li> I recieved a email from a representative of Fulllips sating that they would be sending the 3rd one completely free!</li>
            <li> It really works!</li>
            <li> But the truth is this product would be gold if was able to last 3hrs like it is said to do.  </li>
            <li> I love my plumpers but it doesn&#x27;t last hours like the reviews.</li>
            <li> So when I did finally receive them I was also sent a free additional lip enhancer and a lip liner!</li>
            <li> They really do work!</li>
            <li> the first time she used it, it bruised her lips.</li>
            <li> Y&#x27;all go above &amp; beyond customer service showing so much love.</li>
            <li> At first, I could not use it.</li>
            <li> The product is very temporary but fun to play with-full lip effect lasts 30 mins max.</li>
            <li> These arrived really fast and work like a charm!  </li>
            <li> They really do work!</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> Fast delivery!  </li>
            <li> Linda, I want to thank you too for supporting charities and your the kindest AND</li>
            <li> I really like this product!</li>
            <li> I can only hope with continued use it will work even better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve included a picture of my first attempt but with practice now</li>
            <li> I can get them bigger and more shapely.</li>
            <li> If done properly, it&#x27;s actually quite healthy to keep the blood circulating to your lips.</li>
            <li> Thanks Linda!</li>
            <li> I think the more you use it the longer the results last (meaning consecutive days, not meaning keep it on for an hour).</li>
            <li> I would absolutely suggest this to a friend!</li>
            <li> ... on my first try my lips looked plumped up</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a non-filler, non-invasive, fun and easy way of temporarily getting some of the fullness  in my lips that I had when I was younger</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t use it very frequently to get the full benefit of it.</li>
            <li> She sent me a cute little letter with the invoice with a free gift attach.</li>
            <li> I received a quick and friendly response back.</li>
            <li> Thank you Linda for the extra special gifts, and for the opportunity to have a glimpse at what it&#x27;s like with full lips.</li>
            <li> I would say it&#x27;s great for maybe 40-50 sec before it&#x27;s much smaller.</li>
            <li> but this is a great way to add some subtle oomph (Or not-so-subtle if you choose).</li>
            <li> It looks great at first, but it only lasts about a half hour.</li>
            <li> last too long but looks good</li>
            <li> Gentle enough not to leave a huge ring around your mouth.</li>
            <li> want to thank Linda for taking the time to write personally and taking the time of a huge thank you card.</li>
            <li> Fast and credibility of Connecting</li>
            <li> Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these beauties!</li>
            <li> lips were a tad tender by the end of the first day but all was normal</li>
            <li> It really depends on the size of your mouth/lips.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend this product!</li>
            <li> even if used for a short amount of time with light to medium suction.</li>
            <li> Did not benefit me much.</li>
            <li> are so short-lived that I don&#x27;t see  using it much.</li>
            <li> My lips look and feel very plump after using this.</li>
            <li> it really plumps up my lips...</li>
            <li> I watched the video which was very helpful.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much</li>
            <li> effects wear off fairly fast.  </li>
            <li> however, much cheaper than injections.</li>
            <li> I got three fullips and they through in a lip pencil which was really nice and not cheap looking.</li>
            <li> If you follow the instructions that are clearly spelled out in the most simple way, you WILL see results.</li>
            <li> my lips ended up being to big for the medium which I originally ordered.</li>
            <li> I personally don&#x27;t need it much because I already have full lips</li>
            <li> Worked great just didn&#x27;t last on me for no more then 45min that sucked.</li>
            <li> It takes a little practice but once you get it down your good to go!</li>
            <li> I used the small and the large round, and didn&#x27;t have much use for the medium size, so I gave it away as a gift the person who received it, loved it!</li>
            <li> I only ordered two, but the seller send an extra one for free!</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to have Linda see my comment and send me an email.</li>
            <li> Ladies, we are not getting any younger-we gradually lose the fullness of our lips when we get older</li>
            <li> product itself is very simple and provides quick results.</li>
            <li> but I actually think the ovals work better because they only suction my lips, not the skin around my lips.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and purchase.</li>
            <li> The owner also sent cute little girts with the plumpers.</li>
            <li> It arrived a day earlier than the first day of estimated arrival!</li>
            <li> I was hoping for something a little better.  </li>
            <li> I really love both the large and small oval shaped ones and have found that I can get a pouty bottom lip and even a defined &amp;#34;Cupids-bow&amp;#34; when in reality I do not have a defined cupids bow.  </li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;ve used the large round the most.</li>
            <li> There are a lot of similar things surfacing right now</li>
            <li> Everyone tells me how much they love my lips, they all thought I was using some type of lip gloss to make them look full, I had to share my new secret!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without now.</li>
            <li> then I new MY pressure point.</li>
            <li> Included an extra lip plumper (so it was 3 total) and free lip pencil gift-great vendor.</li>
            <li> At first the effects only lasted a few minutes but the longer and more frequently I use this product the longer my lips stay plump</li>
            <li> But lets be honest......if you meet someone with those lips, be prepared to explain the change later on.  ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The 2 smaller ones are really better for doing one lip at a time which I PREFER because my upper lip is smaller than my bottom lip.</li>
            <li> First off, let me say this: anybody who buys this with expectation that this is a permanent solution obviously has no clue how to read and comorehend.</li>
            <li> I was curious what it would look like for both lips to be equally full.</li>
            <li> You may get a red ring above or below your lips, but this will quickly fade.</li>
            <li> They showed up in a very pretty red satchel/bag with a red satin draw ribbon</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last all day, but certainly for hours.</li>
            <li> If you want a little more &amp;#34;va-va-voom&amp;#34; to that pucker, simply repeat the process.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s awsome that something like this is out there and makes your lips look naturally bigger and is much cheaper than lip injections which, never look natural.</li>
            <li> As far as my opinion on how it works..</li>
            <li> Secondly, my lips didn&#x27;t plump all that much.</li>
            <li> and I was very presently surprised).  </li>
            <li> Wow how can that happen without injections?</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t overdo it and use it to subtly give life to your lips it is a great product for those who just want a little non-aggressive</li>
            <li> The other one was nowhere worth the price</li>
            <li> would recommend this mainly to girls with smaller lips.</li>
            <li> The small size is nice if you want to focus on the center of your lips.</li>
            <li> As we get older, our lips get smaller and the lip color starts to recede.</li>
            <li> The first day I played with all of the sizes and found that the round suction works well for me to do the &amp;#34;cherub&amp;#34; look since I already have full lips but due to age lines they have lost the natural plump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the next normal</li>
            <li> Not only did it come with a free little gift it also came with a note providing helpful care instructions.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m sure if you are reading social media you are hearing about these young kids attempting to use shot glasses to try this method with not good results.</li>
            <li> sometimes I forget I&#x27;m wearing it although I do get impatient because I want it to work quickly.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m too scared to go extreme, but they really do make a difference in your pout! ....</li>
            <li> Lastly, the instruction card had my name and a friendly little note hand written in</li>
            <li> Please be very careful when doing this, and take your time, because if for the first time you&#x27;re trying this, you rush it</li>
            <li> so the small and oval don&#x27;t fit over my lips so if you have full lips already just get the round big one .</li>
            <li> (I hesitate to even call it a nuisance, as it barely qualifies as one.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Seriously, my lips look so full and lush.</li>
            <li> The results are exactly what I expected!!!</li>
            <li> So impressed would recommend to anybody with thin lips who are wanting fast non painful fuller lips.</li>
            <li> First few times I used it, my lips stayed plump about an hour, however over time of continued use my lips have stayed plump longer.</li>
            <li> I get that it &amp;#34;could&amp;#34; last longer over time, but it took so long to get them just slightly plump that it just isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> which is ceylon cinnamon which has more benefits and different from other common grocery store cinnamon.</li>
            <li> A few minutes at best :(</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s full potential, but slowly my pout disappeared within the hour.</li>
            <li> I paid for the Large Round &amp; Medium Oval and it came with the Small Oval as well as a little toothbrush for lip exfoliation and a nude lip liner that I really love, plus instructions.</li>
            <li> The shipping and the customer service was EXCELLENT, but i was very disappointed with the product.</li>
            <li> Each lip enhancer was in it&#x27;s own clear box and the company even included a small red tooth-brush (I&#x27;m assuming to exfoliate the lips to remove all of the rough, dead skin on the lips) AND (bonus), a lip liner (I line my lips and then use the liner for my lip color as well), that has a lip brush on the other end.  </li>
            <li> Honestly, it last long enough to take a picture.</li>
            <li> But once I started with the small oval and worked my why up to the large circle</li>
            <li> First off, the devices are hard and create no suction unless you use them on one lip at a time.</li>
            <li> not sure If i&#x27;m gonna use it that much</li>
            <li> give a long term review later.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last as long as I would like</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> I encourage buying all 3, so you can use the 3 different ones instead of being limited to one style of plump lips</li>
            <li> When I finally managed to make a suction with my lip, I ended up with a black and blue upper lip for over a week!</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s expected it&#x27;s not an actual lip job</li>
            <li> The fullness does not stay for long at all</li>
            <li> I followed all directions, but it did cause minor bruising, even with the instructions and videos.</li>
            <li> I got them today which was way earlier than the expected date of arrival</li>
            <li> Fullips does not claim that their product will bring long term/permanent results.</li>
            <li> I love that these are noninvasive, they don&#x27;t leave weird rings around your mouth, I&#x27;ve gotten zeo bruising or discomfort and the seller is a DOLL!</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;but doesn&#x27;t last that much only few minutes</li>
            <li> will give an update on my journey from thin small lips to full plump enhance lips!</li>
            <li> All it did was make my lips purple and slightly plumper, but the plumping effects didn&#x27;t last but an hour or so.</li>
            <li> The effects only lasted about 30 minutes, which is disappointing because i wouldn&#x27;t want to pull this out every 30 minutes while out with friends or significant other.</li>
            <li> No pain at all just a little suction that you can totally control.</li>
            <li> so be careful.</li>
            <li> I know that the medium suction plumps my lower lip and the circle gives me the center cherub.</li>
            <li> I throw them in my make-up bag that I carry in my purse and can get a boost a few hours later if needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was really worried about it not working on my thin lips.</li>
            <li> I think you should only get the round one..</li>
            <li> Lastly, don&#x27;t be alarmed when your lips look dead after removing the device.</li>
            <li> Follow the directions carefully and your lips will in fact be plumped.</li>
            <li> She was extremely helpful and answered all of my questions and actually threw in a little gift along with my purchase.</li>
            <li> My lips are not even due to accident.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use these every day, but I didn&#x27;t find any bruising or other issues.</li>
            <li> Only used the small one because my lip area is too small for the other two so didn&#x27;t even open them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I can blame the product for this, it could be just my physiology, although I doubt the claims of the effects lasting 3-4 hours.</li>
            <li> I never use the other ones..</li>
            <li> My package came way before expected!</li>
            <li> My only com is I have to use make up on my face around my lips after which I usually don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this at first, but upon receiving it and trying it for myself..</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another thing, if you have smaller lips, I&#x27;d recommend the small oval.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only thing is its not lasting that long for me maybe I&#x27;m doing it wrong?</li>
            <li> THE KEY is don&#x27;t suck too hard because you will give yourself a bruise and not even feel it.</li>
            <li> I went a little overboard on purpose just to see how big my lips would get</li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> Not worth all the $ at all.</li>
            <li> The company sent a round, a small oval/rectangle, and a larger oval/rectangle shape &amp;#34;Fullips, Lip Plumping Enhancer&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I have had them a week and already have down my system</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t say this in attempt to put the product down.</li>
            <li> it will go down after a while.</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;ve gotten the hang of it, it does plump my lips but the fullness only last 30 mins sadly.</li>
            <li> I was shocked how quickly this product arrived.</li>
            <li> as you want just have to do it little by little.</li>
            <li> It works for a little while.</li>
            <li> A little concealer or application of foundation will also help.</li>
            <li> It lasts a couple to a few hours.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> With this product it takes a few times to get the hang of it</li>
            <li> I start with the Medium Oval then switch to the Round and finish up targeting my Cupid&#x27;s bow with the Small Oval.</li>
            <li> When I bought these lip plumpers I was a little skeptical about whether or not it would actually do the trick.</li>
            <li> After I received the package, I was shocked to find that not only had I received the two sizes that I requested, but I also was given the third size as well.</li>
            <li> Too  bad it doesn&#x27;t last long...</li>
            <li> Works but wish it lasted longer than 1 hour! :/</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> Girls, do you all have small lips?</li>
            <li> Takes a few attempts to get the hang of, but there are some videos online that will help you out!</li>
            <li> The small size worked</li>
            <li> P.S. I now take the small oval with me in my purse just so I can pump up my lips if need be.</li>
            <li> For me my lips are small...</li>
            <li> In addition, a small toothbrush was also included for exfoliating the lips.</li>
            <li> I also used the small toothbrush to exfoliate my lips.</li>
            <li> but also leaves a mark around my mouth :/ not flattering</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure .</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s back to flat lips &#x3D;(</li>
            <li> I was excited at the idea, but i didn&#x27;t like the outcome.. sadly :(</li>
            <li> It took me a while to get the hang of it and started off slow, never bruised my lips or sucked too hard.</li>
            <li> You have to start off slow as suggested and build your way up.</li>
            <li> I will be upfront and tell you that you must start out slow.</li>
            <li> The small oval was my fav!</li>
            <li> although i was interested in trying the product I found it terribly overpriced.</li>
            <li> A little disappointing.</li>
            <li> The product is made of hard plastic which is difficult to work with.  </li>
            <li> I can see someone can get addicted over this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I feel like a victoria secret model.</li>
            <li> But sadly, I&#x27;ve lost it.</li>
            <li> This is the secret to fuller sexier lips!</li>
            <li> So, without dipping into yourlife ssavings, this is the secret for you!</li>
            <li> dont go crazy with it</li>
            <li> that being said, if I wanted to go crazy with this (which I tried just for giggle)</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this!</li>
            <li> If you have a history of cold sores do not use this!</li>
            <li> Was very disappointed</li>
            <li> you are all soooo sad!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I LOVE THIS. I followed Fulllips since the company started and always wanted to try it, I finally after many reviews purchased the 2-pack. I recieved a email from a representative of Fulllips sating that they would be sending the 3rd one completely free! I thought it was great that they informed me and that someone contacted me directly. You have to start off slow as suggested and build your way up. I have had them a week and already have down my system, I think it is a great alternative to injection or implants and it doesn&#x27;t come with the commitment.</li>
            <li> thats ok, but i need to used so much for the result</li>
            <li> Love it!  It really works!</li>
            <li> Not for hours, but It will give you a nice, full, plump lip for 30-45 minutes.  Gentle enough not to leave a huge ring around your mouth.</li>
            <li> Your better off using something at home shape in this form and shape. Not worth it.</li>
            <li> The product is made of hard plastic which is difficult to work with.  If they made a flexible rubber material it would be easier to work with.  thank you</li>
            <li> These work wonders. The packaging is so sweet</li>
            <li> the Packaging is So Cute! And it comes with all 3 sizes, a Lip Liner, and a toothbrush for exfoliating. So Worth the Money</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I recieved my fullips! Not only did it come with a free little gift it also came with a note providing helpful care instructions. What customer service. Also the product is amazing. The results are exactly what I expected!!! Thank you fullips!</li>
            <li> Fast and credibility of Connecting</li>
            <li> It works great once you get the hang of how to use it.. As far as my opinion on how it works.. Honestly, it last long enough to take a picture. It starts to shrink in size the moment you stop using it (dramatically). I would say it&#x27;s great for maybe 40-50 sec before it&#x27;s much smaller. I don&#x27;t say this in attempt to put the product down. I think it&#x27;s awsome that something like this is out there and makes your lips look naturally bigger and is much cheaper than lip injections which, never look natural. But the truth is this product would be gold if was able to last 3hrs like it is said to do.  The seller does an amazing job of making you feel you&#x27;re appreciated as a customer. I would love to let her know how grateful I was for that</li>
            <li> it temp. plumps lips. ok for a nite out!</li>
            <li> I love my plumpers but it doesn&#x27;t last hours like the reviews.</li>
            <li> Loveeeee these three little guys gives me nice plumpy lips!</li>
            <li> Works amazingly well! Each time I use it, it works better and better. Seriously, my lips look so full and lush. I feel so beautiful after using this. Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, easy to clean. I can see someone can get addicted over this.&lt;br /&gt;My advice would be not to put them in your car where you have access to everyday.&lt;br /&gt;Will give a long term review later.</li>
            <li> i love it ! This is the best lip plumper I used so far. I only ordered two, but the seller send an extra one for free! The packaged is so cute and thanks for the little gift :)</li>
            <li> It works! Just takes practice</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE IT! I ordered the 2 pack and they sent me all 3! How nice! They even included a toothbrush to circulate the blood flow on my lips and a lip liner! &amp;#60;3 Thank you!</li>
            <li> can we just talk about how great the customer service from this company is! My order came in about 2 days which was awesome because I was anxious to try them. So when I did finally receive them I was also sent a free additional lip enhancer and a lip liner! I&#x27;m so glad they did sent it to me bc my lips ended up being to big for the medium which I originally ordered. I just tried the enhancers quickly bc I was too excited and I did see a difference so im excited to play more but so far so good!</li>
            <li> Since Amazon doesn&#x27;t give you the option to choose the two sizes when purchasing, you&#x27;ll need to write an email to the seller; which you can do through Amazon. She was extremely helpful and answered all of my questions and actually threw in a little gift along with my purchase. The small oval was my fav! But sadly, I&#x27;ve lost it. It took me a while to get the hang of it and started off slow, never bruised my lips or sucked too hard. Now that I&#x27;ve gotten the hang of it, it does plump my lips but the fullness only last 30 mins sadly. I think after continuous use the plump does last an hr or 2 but I don&#x27;t use it very frequently to get the full benefit of it. All in all this is a great product for a safer; when used correctly: lip plump, and makes for great selfies. The customer service also exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> I saw these from their Instagram page and I love them! They really do work! It doesn&#x27;t last as long as I would like but that&#x27;s expected it&#x27;s not an actual lip job it will go down after a while. But my lips really were plump and perfect. Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions and no matter what I tried I could not get these to suction to my lips. Was very disappointed</li>
            <li> they work? I love it. I feel like a victoria secret model. I needed the smallest one and I think I have medium size lips, but I think the seller will send you all 3 for free! Pretty awesome product.</li>
            <li> Item arrived quickly and it was packaged nicely. It works but it does take some practice on how to use. I&#x27;ll keep using it until I get the knack of it..</li>
            <li> Works but wish it lasted longer than 1 hour! :/</li>
            <li> Works great!!  However, The fullness does not last for 2 hours as instructed.</li>
            <li> The fullness does not stay for long at all therefore I don&#x27;t even ever use it.. I wonder if I can return it..</li>
            <li> it does what it says. review from my girlfriend:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;though&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) ofcourse the effects are temporary&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) the first time she used it, it bruised her lips. so be careful. dont go crazy with it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not try, because it&#x27;s a gift</li>
            <li> I love love love these lip enhancers. They work wonders! &amp; when you follow the instructions &amp; use them safely &amp; slowly, your lips become fuller, more plump, &amp; all around amazing! A hugeeee thank you for the extra gifts that came with my package. Y&#x27;all go above &amp; beyond customer service showing so much love. Thank you thank you! I highly recommend these beauties! (:</li>
            <li> you are all soooo sad!!!</li>
            <li> Great results but they do not last more than an hour unfortunately.</li>
            <li> Really liked this it enhances your lips as much as you want just have to do it little by little.</li>
            <li> I was excited at the idea, but i didn&#x27;t like the outcome.. sadly :( I followed all directions, but it did cause minor bruising, even with the instructions and videos. The effects only lasted about 30 minutes, which is disappointing because i wouldn&#x27;t want to pull this out every 30 minutes while out with friends or significant other. The shipping and the customer service was EXCELLENT, but i was very disappointed with the product.</li>
            <li> It works but it kinda has to hurt your lips in order to be efficient. Simple plastic cap</li>
            <li> The product is great! I personally don&#x27;t need it much because I already have full lips but it&#x27;s nice to plump them up a bit. It lasts a couple to a few hours. It takes some time to get the hang of it though. The owner also sent cute little girts with the plumpers. I got a lip liner with it &amp; the packaging was cute with a letter. Also if you order the package of 2 she sends the 3rd one for free!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this mainly to girls with smaller lips. My friend has tiny lips &amp; she&#x27;s in love with this product because it gives her the fuller lips she&#x27;s always wanted without having to go to surgery or botox to get them enlarged.</li>
            <li> It didnt work at all, all what happed my lips git purple</li>
            <li> Delivery was ahead of schedule! How awesome is that? The lip enhancer is super cool and does work!!!</li>
            <li> Everything was perfectly packaged but I don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s not working for me :/ I&#x27;ve checked so many youtube videos that I&#x27;m starting to think my lips are just weird</li>
            <li> The smallest one I cant fit my lips in but they larger ones work.  It is temporary as it tells you but they can tend to leave a hicky type ring around the top lip if your not careful!!</li>
            <li> It does the job, but to me it only last like an hour if that. This is great for a moment, I don&#x27;t know if its the same for everyone.</li>
            <li> i just got my fullips in the mail yesterday and I had an extra gift! they all came in a nice fabric bag and it also came with a personalized letter from the owner! the product works too! i will be suggesting to friends to pick one up. the care that fullips took with my package is awesome and people should take notes! thank you fullips!</li>
            <li> Plumping effect doens&#x27;t last too long but looks good</li>
            <li> I have full lips to begin with but this is a great way to add some subtle oomph (Or not-so-subtle if you choose). It comes with tips and instructions to avoid any indentation marks being made on your face. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> This is my wish come true. At first, I could not use it. It made no difference but once you become comfortable with it, it works wonders. There is a learning curve. There are so many videos showing you how to use it but you have to find the position that works for you. Different positions work for different people. I can&#x27;t live without now. Furthermore, the customer service is amazing.</li>
            <li> Holy Smokes!!! This actually works!!! I will be upfront and tell you that you must start out slow. The first day I played with all of the sizes and found that the round suction works well for me to do the &amp;#34;cherub&amp;#34; look since I already have full lips but due to age lines they have lost the natural plump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My lips were a tad tender by the end of the first day but all was normal the next normal so I started to play with more looks. I did short suctions (about 15-20) seconds repeatedly until I got the look I wanted and then applied chapstick. By day 4 I could leave the suction times on longer. Now that I have played with it enough I know that the medium suction plumps my lower lip and the circle gives me the center cherub. I throw them in my make-up bag that I carry in my purse and can get a boost a few hours later if needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tell tell sign that makes me a fan is that when I went into work my co-workers all looked at me and &amp;#34;I can&#x27;t put my finger on it but you look younger.&amp;#34; Eeeeeeee! If you don&#x27;t overdo it and use it to subtly give life to your lips it is a great product for those who just want a little non-aggressive change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that being said, if I wanted to go crazy with this (which I tried just for giggle) I can get Angelina Jolie lips for the night. But lets be honest......if you meet someone with those lips, be prepared to explain the change later on.  ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are awesome! I love playing with these and I would recommend them to anyone wanting to challenge age, change your look, or add some sexy to your kiss!</li>
            <li> I recommend this product. The packaging was really cute. I ordered two sizes and they sent me all three! Plus a lip liner and a lip brush. It also comes with detailed instructions. It takes a little practice but once you get it down your good to go! I found it best to watch her daughter demonstrate on their YouTube video. That&#x27;s when it clicked for me. I prefer the medium size overall. The small size is nice if you want to focus on the center of your lips. It really depends on the size of your mouth/lips.</li>
            <li> Great! Included an extra lip plumper (so it was 3 total) and free lip pencil gift-great vendor. The product is very temporary but fun to play with-full lip effect lasts 30 mins max.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend this product! It works just as stated and the seller (Linda) is FANTASTIC! I purchased this product because I saw a beauty guru on youtube review a similar product. I left a comment saying that although i was interested in trying the product I found it terribly overpriced. I was lucky enough to have Linda see my comment and send me an email. She told me all about Fullips and I knew I would be purchasing ASAP. Not only is Fullips very reasonably priced but the product itself is SO MUCH more beautiful and polished. The other one was nowhere worth the price and I didn&#x27;t feel confident that it would work. Plus I thought it was a bit of an eyesore. I am giddy as can be! THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU! &#x3D;) The handwritten note and extra goodies were icing on the cake!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and one more thing..shipping was super fast. I ordered saturday morning and it arrived on monday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Very Happy Customer!</li>
            <li> Loved it! Just as described</li>
            <li> So impressed by this product. I was really worried about it not working on my thin lips. But once I started with the small oval and worked my why up to the large circle I noticed a huge difference. Very excited when I saw I got 3 sizes instead of 2 plus a lip liner and lip brush when I opened up my package. It doesn&#x27;t last long but it does say use a plump lipgloss and that&#x27;s what I did and it expanded the time 2 more hours. Got me through a 5 hour work day. So impressed would recommend to anybody with thin lips who are wanting fast non painful fuller lips. Loved putting on lipstick and having a upper lip to work with normally my lipstick would just be a straight line. GREAT PRODUCT!! It wasn&#x27;t letting me post a picture but the results were amazing</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m not doing it right. I can get a good result but it lasts less time than it took me to plump... A few minutes at best :(</li>
            <li> Loved the sweet packaging. It was fun using it. I used it to it&#x27;s full potential, but slowly my pout disappeared within the hour. It&#x27;s good for photo sessions and 1-3 hour date nights, but not all day. I used the small and the large round, and didn&#x27;t have much use for the medium size, so I gave it away as a gift the person who received it, loved it!</li>
            <li> I just  received this item today. What a waste of money. First off, the devices are hard and create no suction unless you use them on one lip at a time. Secondly, my lips didn&#x27;t plump all that much. All it did was make my lips purple and slightly plumper, but the plumping effects didn&#x27;t last but an hour or so. I get that it &amp;#34;could&amp;#34; last longer over time, but it took so long to get them just slightly plump that it just isn&#x27;t worth it. Every time I see someone use this in a video, they make it seem like you put it on your mouth, where it magically creates a suction that has to be pried off, and boom: fuller lips. Sure. I will certainly be returning this ASAP!</li>
            <li> Girls, do you all have small lips? Do you yearn for big juicy lips like you want? Do you want to feel sexy? Then try out Fullips enhancers! This is the secret to fuller sexier lips! You don&#x27;t need to pay thousands of dollars just for getting what you want in sexy lips--just pay about $40:00 something dollars for these beautiful babies and you are on the road to looking and feeling gorgeous! I want to tell you all that the owner of the business-Ms Linda Gomez--she is great! I had an issue with the post office losing my first package,and I contacted Linda, and she was so sweet in replacing my package. I would recommend her if you want big sexy lips! Ladies, we are not getting any younger-we gradually lose the fullness of our lips when we get older So, without dipping into yourlife ssavings, this is the secret for you! Why not give it a try girls? You can&#x27;t go wrong with this! But one thing you must know is that when using this entails you sucking into this item. Please be very careful when doing this, and take your time, because if for the first time you&#x27;re trying this, you rush it, you will end up getting a &#x27;hickie&#x27;-(a bruise). So if you decide to go for your gorgeous lips, please follow the enclosed instructions inside your gift. Stay young and happy!!</li>
            <li> I love these lip plumper. My lips are not even due to accident. So with these device. I work with it to create a full even lips.</li>
            <li> Ordered two and received the full set instead! Also included a lovely lip liner and brush to exfoliate my lips! Bonus! I&#x27;m too scared to go extreme, but they really do make a difference in your pout! ....even if used for a short amount of time with light to medium suction. Takes a few attempts to get the hang of, but there are some videos online that will help you out! Great alternative to lip injections or to see if you really want larger lips before committing to injections.</li>
            <li> When I finally managed to make a suction with my lip, I ended up with a black and blue upper lip for over a week! I don&#x27;t see how this will fit anybody&#x27;s lips. I tried all the different sizes and this is just a gimmick. Save your money and love the lips you have!</li>
            <li> Definitely works! I don&#x27;t use these every day, but I didn&#x27;t find any bruising or other issues.</li>
            <li> Only used the small one because my lip area is too small for the other two so didn&#x27;t even open them. The small size worked but I guess by the preassure my bottom lip was blistered twice and didn&#x27;t even do that much suction or time because I wanted to take it easy. They are sitting in my make up drawer. I would have sent a pic but the app wouldn&#x27;t allow me to upload.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for trying to make your lips more plump</li>
            <li> Ahhhh I&#x27;m in love! The packaging is beautiful! And I recived a personal thank you from Linda! She even gave me a lip liner as well! I cant wait to show my awesome lips! Xoxox</li>
            <li> These arrived really fast and work like a charm!  These plumped my lips up right away, were super easy to use, and did not hurt one bit.  These are my new favorite thing.  Also, super awesome seller!  Love that she included a lip liner in the package.</li>
            <li> temporary results. can cause bruising inside lip. product does work though.</li>
            <li> Works great, wish it lasted longer</li>
            <li> It works for a little while. After researching it and watching videos on YouTube, they said it would last for four hours. I find that to not be true in my case. It looks great at first, but it only lasts about a half hour. It looks great while its puffed, but it goes down too soon. 😞</li>
            <li> Did not benefit me much.</li>
            <li> The product came very quickly and very well packaged.  It works as described except the effects are so short-lived that I don&#x27;t see  using it much. I&#x27;m not sure I can blame the product for this, it could be just my physiology, although I doubt the claims of the effects lasting 3-4 hours.</li>
            <li> I love these! They really do work!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work well at all or easily either. Your lips only stay swollen for 10 minutes at max! Not worth all the $ at all.</li>
            <li> Love these! If you want bigger lips and don&#x27;t have the money for surgery, this is the way to go. See my before and after</li>
            <li> Love them!!! Totally practical and thought it was so sweet of the sender to include a beautiful complimentary lip liner.</li>
            <li> I have to practice using this product, but so far so good.</li>
            <li> I bought pack of two but it come in all three size, really happy about that. It also came with lip stick and a brush to exfoliate your lips.</li>
            <li> I bought fullips a couple months ago and have been using it most days. It plumps my lips up but only last 5 minutes. A little disappointing.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love fullips enhancer!!! It&#x27;s the best thing ever made to pump lips.</li>
            <li> Great product and the owner is as sweet and professional as can be. Still fairly new at using the product but thanks to all the great tips I should be a pro in no time at all ;)</li>
            <li> I ordered the combo pack, because I really wasn&#x27;t sure what size or shape  would be best for me. The company sent a round, a small oval/rectangle, and a larger oval/rectangle shape &amp;#34;Fullips, Lip Plumping Enhancer&amp;#34;.  They showed up in a very pretty red satchel/bag with a red satin draw ribbon (presentation is big with me and I was very presently surprised).  Each lip enhancer was in it&#x27;s own clear box and the company even included a small red tooth-brush (I&#x27;m assuming to exfoliate the lips to remove all of the rough, dead skin on the lips) AND (bonus), a lip liner (I line my lips and then use the liner for my lip color as well), that has a lip brush on the other end.  It&#x27;s fun to play around with these little guys to see what my ideal fullness is.  I really love both the large and small oval shaped ones and have found that I can get a pouty bottom lip and even a defined &amp;#34;Cupids-bow&amp;#34; when in reality I do not have a defined cupids bow.  It&#x27;s a non-filler, non-invasive, fun and easy way of temporarily getting some of the fullness  in my lips that I had when I was younger (I&#x27;m 48). Do I wish it lasted longer?  Yes; however they deliver on their promise for a temporary fullness that causes no discomfort at all.</li>
            <li> Very nice, full lips indeed. Too  bad it doesn&#x27;t last long... maybe a good 10-20min and it&#x27;s back to flat lips &#x3D;(</li>
            <li> Great product when used properly. Your lips will look fuller for an hour or so. The customer service for this store is great and they respond fast if you have any questions.</li>
            <li> Love love and love all three enhancers work great for different plumping. I also received a beautiful lip liner &amp;#34;Glacier Pink&amp;#34; for free! The color is amazing. The perfect nude pink.  Fast delivery!  All around awesome. I will be ordering another lip liner for sure!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last long. Bruised lip but once got the hang of it works for a short time. For photos maybe.</li>
            <li> I have used it several times and it works good for about 20-30 minutes, after that my lips turn back to its original size.  Maybe I am not applying it like I&#x27;m supposed to, but it does it every time.</li>
            <li> Looooovvveee!!!! First of all I got it super quick after I ordered it! Second I just&lt;br /&gt;got it today and I love it! I watched the YouTube tutorial on it and it worked wonderfully! My bottom lip is ask ready pretty full so I focused on my top lip and it did exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fan of Michelle Phan on youtube and she mentions Fullips and using it mainly on one of her youtube videos on achieving full luscious lips. I bought the &amp;#34;true cinnamon&amp;#34; which is ceylon cinnamon which has more benefits and different from other common grocery store cinnamon. I got it here on amazon from the company frontiers but the smallest and affordable one in ounces. Also using the toothbrush technic and the rose salve lip balm that I too got on here on amazon. Although Michelle Phan has a lot of really good lip fullness. And naturally plumping, but the most of all that truly does work is Fullips Lip Plumbing Enhancer. I got the pack and let founder Linda about how if would be nice to have all three to get the full benefit even one can do but three makes it the best!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will give an update on my journey from thin small lips to full plump enhance lips! I got them today which was way earlier than the expected date of arrival time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to thank Linda for taking the time to write personally and taking the time of a huge thank you card. Linda, I want to thank you too for supporting charities and your the kindest AND most heart reached out women. Your amazing. God Bless and the support and your heart towards your customers, family, and the charities you support.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I will give update on my lips.</li>
            <li> Great product, great service! Thanks so much!!!</li>
            <li> Really work, &amp; I received 2 free gifts with purchase!!</li>
            <li> I love love love this product. When I bought these lip plumpers I was a little skeptical about whether or not it would actually do the trick. It totally exceeded my expectations! You can use the different sizes to control how plump your lips get &amp; the results will not dissapoint! If you&#x27;re looking for something to get those full Kylie Jenner lips, this is the product for you!</li>
            <li> I really like this product! My lips look and feel very plump after using this. At first the effects only lasted a few minutes but the longer and more frequently I use this product the longer my lips stay plump I can only hope with continued use it will work even better. I&#x27;ve included a picture of my first attempt but with practice now I can get them bigger and more shapely. It&#x27;s very comfortable when used correctly, sometimes I forget I&#x27;m wearing it although I do get impatient because I want it to work quickly.  But it&#x27;s best to start slow. I start with the Medium Oval then switch to the Round and finish up targeting my Cupid&#x27;s bow with the Small Oval. I paid for the Large Round &amp; Medium Oval and it came with the Small Oval as well as a little toothbrush for lip exfoliation and a nude lip liner that I really love, plus instructions. Buy it!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is worth it. None of the sizes worked on my lips. Ive tried a lot of different times, and have watched different videos on how to use them. However they just dont work.</li>
            <li> I think you should only get the round one.. I never use the other ones..&lt;br /&gt;but doesn&#x27;t last that much only few minutes .. I like it it works maybe 30% but not sure If i&#x27;m gonna use it that much</li>
            <li> My package came way before expected! And yes it does work.... I think I just have to get used to it. I do it while I drive going somewhere so that way my lips will be plump when I get there for longer. My only com is I have to use make up on my face around my lips after which I usually don&#x27;t. To cover the red marks. But other then that I&#x27;m sure once I get the hang of it it will be flawless</li>
            <li> these are awesome! love it love it love it! it really plumps up my lips... i just wish my lips would stay plump longer than an hour.</li>
            <li> This product definitely does what it&#x27;s supposed to. I just wish the effect would last longer but then again I&#x27;m still getting the hang of it. I would recommend this product 💋</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this at first, but upon receiving it and trying it for myself.. I absolutely LOVE this. I normally don&#x27;t write reviews but this one was very well deserving of one. It&#x27;s SO easy to use too! Why go get lip injections when you can use these instead?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing, if you have smaller lips, I&#x27;d recommend the small oval.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW.. The owner is SUCH a sweetheart!! She sent me a cute little letter with the invoice with a free gift attach. Truly amazing customer service. If you&#x27;re on the fence, I&#x27;d definitely encourage you to just take the leap and purchase this. It&#x27;s life changing.</li>
            <li> I love these Fullips! First few times I used it, my lips stayed plump about an hour, however over time of continued use my lips have stayed plump longer. I love how my lips look in pictures now!</li>
            <li> I love this product!! I have ordered two sets...one for me and one for my daughter. I use all three sizes as I am putting on my make-up. I watched the video which was very helpful. My lips are huge now and stay tha way for about four hours. I can make them too big!! Wow how can that happen without injections? Well, with this product you can!. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it. The lip gloss is also very nice. Great colors. P.S. I now take the small oval with me in my purse just so I can pump up my lips if need be.</li>
            <li> Make SURE to apply a good Chapstick... This creates a much better &#x27;seal&#x27;. If you use it without moisturizing on and around your lips, you will find that you will lose your suction quickly and let&#x27;s face it... It is the suction that creates the PLUMP! Now I&#x27;m sure if you are reading social media you are hearing about these young kids attempting to use shot glasses to try this method with not good results. Let me explain why this DOES WORK. It has rounded edges so it doesn&#x27;t leave marks... It comes in a pack with 2 different shapes and they can be used in different ways. The larger more rounded one is good to not both lips in... The 2 smaller ones are really better for doing one lip at a time which I PREFER because my upper lip is smaller than my bottom lip. It&#x27;s important to note how you want your lips plumped... For me my lips are small... So when I&#x27;m sucking, I kind of gently pull the plumper in a downward motion to make them fuller underneath... Kind of like Michelle Pfeiffer&#x27;s lips. THE KEY is don&#x27;t suck too hard because you will give yourself a bruise and not even feel it. It&#x27;s nothing that concealer won&#x27;t cover, but then I new MY pressure point. Now when I&#x27;m plumping, I know when to stop. This really does work and the more you do it, the fuller they stay for longer. The truth is. As we get older, our lips get smaller and the lip color starts to recede. If done properly, it&#x27;s actually quite healthy to keep the blood circulating to your lips. I hope this helps!!</li>
            <li> The product came in nicely rapped I got three fullips and they through in a lip pencil which was really nice and not cheap looking. I like it but the effect doesn&#x27;t last longer than 40 minutes on me, that is. But it&#x27;s pretty cool to have if your against lip fillers.</li>
            <li> I was shocked how quickly this product arrived. It arrived a day earlier than the first day of estimated arrival! Also, I contacted the seller in order to request the two sizes that I wanted. I received a quick and friendly response back. After I received the package, I was shocked to find that not only had I received the two sizes that I requested, but I also was given the third size as well. In addition, a small toothbrush was also included for exfoliating the lips. Lastly, the instruction card had my name and a friendly little note hand written in ink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is very simple and provides quick results. Simply place your lips inside the product, suck the air out, hold for 15-30 seconds, and then pop off the device by blowing air back into the chamber. If you want a little more &amp;#34;va-va-voom&amp;#34; to that pucker, simply repeat the process. You may get a red ring above or below your lips, but this will quickly fade. A little concealer or application of foundation will also help. I also used the small toothbrush to exfoliate my lips. So far, I&#x27;ve used the large round the most. I have used the medium oval once to experiment on plumping one lip. I have a thinner upper lip, than lower one. I was curious what it would look like for both lips to be equally full. Lastly, don&#x27;t be alarmed when your lips look dead after removing the device. Mine looked blue. It will quickly fade. Also, a swipe of lip-gloss quickly resolves that nuisance. (I hesitate to even call it a nuisance, as it barely qualifies as one.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was a phenomenal experience and a great product! I will DEFINITELY be buying from this seller again. I highly recommend this product and purchase. Thanks Linda!</li>
            <li> Ughmazing! Thank you so much</li>
            <li> Firstly, the seller is so great. I sent her a message asking her about which two I wanted and she answered so quickly. She shipped the items quickly and gave me a bunch of freebies! So sweet. Secondly, this is a great product. There are a lot of similar things surfacing right now but this one is gentle and safe. Follow the directions carefully and your lips will in fact be plumped. It doesn&#x27;t last all day, but certainly for hours. I think the more you use it the longer the results last (meaning consecutive days, not meaning keep it on for an hour). I have small-medium lips so I thought the large round plumper would be my best bet but I actually think the ovals work better because they only suction my lips, not the skin around my lips. I like experimenting with all three. I would absolutely suggest this to a friend!</li>
            <li> I am in love! The packaging, the costumer care, the extra things I didn&#x27;t even pay for! Oh I love it! Works so well! I got three plumping enhancers and a brush for lip exfoliating! Thank you Linda! You rock!</li>
            <li> They worked wonderfully , and the seller is amazing!!! I definitely would recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> Very happy with my purchase the presentation of the products packaging was beautifuly donr and thr product truely works... on my first try my lips looked plumped up, i love this product very happy with it....</li>
            <li> Officially in love with this product. Took a day to finally get a grip of how to use it properly (thank youuuu, youtube!) :) and I definitely felt more confident after using them. I encourage buying all 3, so you can use the 3 different ones instead of being limited to one style of plump lips</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great works very well , the only thing is I have full lips so the small and oval don&#x27;t fit over my lips so if you have full lips already just get the round big one .</li>
            <li> Bought these to review for my blog and wasn&#x27;t happy with the results.  I was hoping for something a little better.  Would reccomend buying lip venom instead.</li>
            <li> Crappy, cheap product marketed by a bunch of bullies!</li>
            <li> First off, let me say this: anybody who buys this with expectation that this is a permanent solution obviously has no clue how to read and comorehend. Fullips does not claim that their product will bring long term/permanent results. If you follow the instructions that are clearly spelled out in the most simple way, you WILL see results. Though they may only be temporary, it still works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, onto the actual review. Linda truly outdid herself! I only ordered the 2-pack, and she sent me all 3 PLUS an exfoliation brush AND this gorgeous lip liner in maple. The instruction card was personally signed by her and the packaging was so beautifully done. I am thrilled with Fullips and will be telling everyone I know about this amazing product! Thank you Linda for the extra special gifts, and for the opportunity to have a glimpse at what it&#x27;s like with full lips. Xoxo</li>
            <li> If you have a history of cold sores do not use this! I haven&#x27;t had one for years until I used this. It works awesome tho</li>
            <li> effects wear off fairly fast.  however, much cheaper than injections.</li>
            <li> Make my lips plump really nice! but also leaves a mark around my mouth :/ not flattering</li>
            <li> Wonderful product I use all day!!! Everyone tells me how much they love my lips, they all thought I was using some type of lip gloss to make them look full, I had to share my new secret! I use 2 of the sizes, at home, in my car, in my office at work, in the bathroom at work and I even take one out with me if it fits in the clutch I&#x27;m carrying, I believe this is a must have in every girl&#x27;s makeup kit! Also most importantly the owner is such a doll!! So caring and sweet and created a product that she&#x27;s passionate about and gives her customers the most amazing customer service I&#x27;ve ever experienced!</li>
            <li> Just left the ER for uncontrolled swelling!!!!!</li>
            <li> This product is great! I was thinking of injections after seeing the results I will not be getting them! With this product it takes a few times to get the hang of it but it is AWESOME !</li>
            <li> Thankyou for making such an awesome product I love it.I will send a picture soon this is the real deal love it! :-</li>
            <li> Love these!! All 3 sizes do different things. They totally work! No pain at all just a little suction that you can totally control. I went a little overboard on purpose just to see how big my lips would get and they were riiiiiiidiculous. I love that these are noninvasive, they don&#x27;t leave weird rings around your mouth, I&#x27;ve gotten zeo bruising or discomfort and the seller is a DOLL! Personalized thank you cards, extra treats. Totally recommend.</li>
            <li> Love these.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Worked great just didn&#x27;t last on me for no more then 45min that sucked.</li>
            <li> This actually works it&#x27;s great! The packaging was amazing and I only ordered 2 and it came with 3. The only thing is its not lasting that long for me maybe I&#x27;m doing it wrong? I don&#x27;t know.  But my lips will plump but it&#x27;ll last me about 10 minutes max. It worked like that for a friend of mine too so I&#x27;m not sure .</li>
