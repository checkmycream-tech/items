            <li>I do however feel like it is some powerful lotion!</li>
            <li>Please let me know if theres any other good product out there.</li>
            <li>BUT I WILL SAY IT CAN ONLY GET BETTER FROM HERE....</li>
            <li>As I was applying Celtrixa I have started seeing results in the first week.</li>
            <li>is the first to start showing results.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t know how much it is for 3 bottles.  </li>
            <li>it did absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>THANKS CELTRIXA</li>
            <li>But it works very well</li>
            <li>Keeping me young!!</li>
            <li>It does not get rid of stretch marks but fades them to the point where I am satisfied after just a few weeks.</li>
            <li>but once I stopped using it they came right back.</li>
            <li>I had my baby 2 years ago and got some pretty deep stretch marks.  </li>
            <li>my stretch marks have markedly faded.  </li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve been using this cream faithfully for 2 weeks</li>
            <li>This is totally real and I totally recommend!</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m going to continue to use it to see if the marks go away completely</li>
            <li>Wow, I did not believe this would actually fade stretch marks</li>
            <li>This item that I been using for the past months hasn&#x27;t been making no change to my stretch marks and in fact, it takes forever for them to ship it to your house plus they didn&#x27;t send me the right body that I saw online when Imade my purchase</li>

            <li> it does not work @ all waste of my money s best you use bio oil @ least u start to c it working</li>
            <li> Didnt work for me.showed no signs of change</li>
            <li> Great company, product and shipping!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the product effectiveness, it works slowly and has a beer scent. Use it after each shower for a few months before you see some results. Healthy diet and exercise will help too. You can&#x27;t expect it to work if you&#x27;re also gaining weight.</li>
            <li> I had my baby 2 years ago and got some pretty deep stretch marks.  I received the cream as a gift so I don&#x27;t know how much it is for 3 bottles.  I have been using the product for a few weeks, twice a day as indicated and my stretch marks have markedly faded.  I am happy with the product and intend on buying more online once my bottles run out.  It does not get rid of stretch marks but fades them to the point where I am satisfied after just a few weeks.</li>
            <li> It smells awful and just like the other products in their line it did absolutely nothing. This was a big purchase mistake.</li>
            <li> this cream doesn&#x27;t work however I  see no improvements with my skin. I should have know it was to good to be true.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;M CURRENTLY USING THIS PRODUCT SO FAR SO GOOD I&#x27;LL KEEP U POSTED....BUT I WILL SAY IT CAN ONLY GET BETTER FROM HERE....THANKS CELTRIXA</li>
            <li> This product smells awful and it didnt even fade one stretch mark. I just had my baby six months ago and I bought this like one month ago and it hasent even worked yet. Dont waste your money buying this.</li>
            <li> I try a lot of these types of product and this overpriced bottle is worthless and it did not work.</li>
            <li> This item that I been using for the past months hasn&#x27;t been making no change to my stretch marks and in fact, it takes forever for them to ship it to your house plus they didn&#x27;t send me the right body that I saw online when Imade my purchase</li>
            <li> I noticed the stretch marks slightly fading but once I stopped using it they came right back. Not the best product</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve been using this cream faithfully for 2 weeks and I don&#x27;t see any signs of improvement.  Not working at all.  Don&#x27;t believe all the hype about this one.  It doesn&#x27;t work, at least not for me.</li>
            <li> Wow, I did not believe this would actually fade stretch marks but it truly did. Only in a matter of weeks they were gone! This is totally real and I totally recommend! I had dark red stretch marks and now they are gone. Wish I could upload a picture!</li>
            <li> My sister gave me hers but it didn&#x27;t have much left in it and so I figured I&#x27;d try it out. Within three days I noticed a difference. So happy I decided to buy more.</li>
            <li> Have NOT seen any changes for the last month now... How long does it take?? Please let me know if theres any other good product out there.</li>
            <li> I love this its be good for my starchmark i can tell it ben helping I use celtrixa &amp; exfoliate</li>
            <li> I have used this for awhile now and have not seen any improvement in my stretch marks.in fact they just keep getting worse.</li>
            <li> good with stretch marks</li>
            <li> As I was applying Celtrixa I have started seeing results in the first week. They are fading but still noticable. But it works very well I have had these stretch marks for almost 3 years now and out of all the products I have used Celtrixa is the first to start showing results.</li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t like it. didnt work on me. never buying it no more. im going to buy something different instead.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!! I use it on my face after I exfoliate daily. My skin feels awesome!! Keeping me young!! (:</li>
            <li> I used it a couple of times but then I broke out in hives from it. Allergic reaction. I do however feel like it is some powerful lotion! Hope it works for you!</li>
            <li> I just started 3 weeks ago so for so good its lighting up  lil bit so I&#x27;m going to continue to use it to see if the marks go away completely</li>
