    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>/&gt;This is the best product in the world.</li>
            <li>Face/skin care products are best and \\&quot;organic\\&quot; when it has no fragrance.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s incredible!</li>
            <li>and I will say System 6 is the best product that I have used.</li>
            <li>Atomy leaves my skin perfectly moisturized all day.</li>
            <li>This product is awesome.</li>
            <li>Great Product.  </li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t know what kind of cleansing products that you are using, please use Evening 4 for the best result.</li>
            <li>so I already love it!!</li>
            <li>This is very nice products.  </li>
            <li>I thought I had a good complexion before, but this blew my standards out of the water.  </li>
            <li>Good quality for your face and made of herbs.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really good for the skin.</li>
            <li>The best way is to just to become a member which is FREE and no obligation to buy monthly - you order as you go.</li>
            <li>And as a plus, they have a light floral scent to them that I find very pleasant.</li>
            <li>product itself has a very nice, very light herbal smell.  </li>
            <li>but I am very glad</li>
            <li>My skin was glowy and smooth and felt hydrated and happy.</li>
            <li>and now I have all these full bottles that will end up in the trash!!</li>
            <li>The first use was great</li>
            <li>The bb cream has a light, natural color that blends beautifully and gives your face a bright, dewy finish.  </li>
            <li>Though it *would* be nice if they made trial sizes available.</li>
            <li>so glad I chanced it.  </li>
            <li>I have been using System 6 for more than a year now</li>
            <li>I am in love, and will continue using every one of these products.</li>
            <li>However, the quality is better the products selling at the mall.</li>
            <li>I am satisfied.</li>
            <li>and it would get better.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Much more affordable.</li>
            <li>That is because the ones that are advertising on these sites are waiting until they get a bunch of people ordering them so they can get a better deal on the products.</li>
            <li>but if you buy 3 or more you get it for $89 each.</li>
            <li>and I have saved a ton of money for top quality products that if I bought anywhere else, I would be paying a fortune for.</li>
            <li>and for the first time in my life, I have clear skin that is moisturized perfectly!</li>
            <li>It turns my face into a flawless canvas for foundation and other color make up.</li>
            <li>so to switch to another product was not an easy choice</li>
            <li>then read the fine print on the ingredients list.</li>
            <li>HUGE PROBLEM!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have only good things to report, improved tone and texture and more balanced appearance of skin color.</li>
            <li>Black spot, ache goes away gradually when I use it and also it is very fair and cheap price.  </li>
            <li>To preface, I did not buy this from Amazon nor an Amazon vendor, but I thought that my point of view as an allergy-sufferer might be useful with regard to the \\&quot;good for sensitive skin\\&quot; claims of the ATOMY SKIN CARE 6 SYSTEM:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Still, it was nice to know that it&#x27;s actually getting into my skin, and not just sitting on top to be wiped away</li>
            <li>AND before anyone wants to say it - YES- I have been so pleased with Atomy products, I decided to become a member</li>
            <li>The essence is very soothing and blurs a lot of the imperfections and fine lines on my face.  </li>
            <li>The heavier night cream is still light and really refreshes the skin after scrubbing the day&#x27;s makeup away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but most people will think that I would be around my early 30.</li>
            <li>However, as I&#x27;m getting older, I&#x27;m realizing more and more that the future of my complexion rests on my choices now, so I began researching for some product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They put 500 times more herbal exacts that are good for your skin where as other products can&#x27;t put more than 0.1% of herbal extract due to lack of technology.</li>
            <li>so I think my theory of cream after cream on my face was right.</li>
            <li>At first, the product went on smoothly and felt very hydrating.  </li>
            <li>This set is great-- The price might seem a little steep, but you really get a lot of product.</li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to be born with pretty good skin to begin with, so skincare was never a big concern of mine.  </li>
            <li>My skin is still the same after 2 month of use; I was expecting something better.</li>
            <li>product was referred to me as something fabulous for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Sure enough, the products contain added fragrance.</li>
            <li>My skin drinks it up and actually appears more radiant than I have seen it in years.</li>
            <li>I could see a difference in my skin within the first week.</li>
            <li>I was previously using Estee Lauder products and I was very pleased with them</li>
            <li>I was a little worried about the fragrance since I have ridiculously sensitive skin more recent than ever, but since I&#x27;ve had excellent experiences with prior Korean products I continued forth.  </li>
            <li>All the products absorb pretty fast, and with each layer, my skin gets silkier and silkier.</li>
            <li>After looking at the ingredients, I found that for the most part nothing made me nervous except for the alcohol in the toner, however, I was really excited since I have used some Korean products in the past.  </li>
            <li>Reasonable price and quality</li>
            <li>It also works really well as a primer if you want to use a powder or matte finish foundation.  </li>
            <li>stuff really does absorb into your skin.  </li>
            <li>Maybe I switched products too soon and too much or something in the product disagrees with my skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very helpful how the set includes everything you need.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure about the wrinkles yet, but I still love the products and the price!</li>
            <li>I have recommended this product to 2 other friends of mine and they love it as well.</li>
            <li>I do feel like the pores around my nose on my cheeks are getting bigger, but they look clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my late 20&#x27;s with fair, very sensitive combination skin, and I&#x27;ve been searching for quality skincare products to protect and prevent before my skin starts to show signs of aging.</li>
            <li>, I apply a fuller coverage foundation over the BB cream during the day and I find the foundation sits better and less cakey if you let the BB cream and the rest of the products sink in for an hour</li>
            <li>This particular brand came highly recommended.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to anyone who has problem skin and has tried everything else on the market.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this product</li>
            <li>cuz the moisturing materials can not be absorbed into your pores cuz they are bigger than your pores.</li>
            <li>After a few days, your face will get better.</li>
            <li>I use the regimen at night with more of the heavy cream than I would during the day, and I wake up with radiant skin in the morning.</li>
            <li>Take it for what it&#x27;s worth and do yourself a favor- cut out the middle man on this one.</li>
            <li>My skin is soft, glowy (but in no way, shape, or form even remotely oily), and so smooth.  </li>
            <li>The lotion is light and NEVER feels heavy or sticky and it all absorbs incredibly fast.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m about a week into use and like most of the other reviews stated, I&#x27;m starting to break out.</li>
            <li>My make-up sticks better, my face doesn&#x27;t have that tight, dry feeling most product causes, and even the slight redness in my face has gone</li>
            <li>I love this product cuz unlike other skin care products this actually gets absorbed deep into skin because the moisturizing materials are smaller than the pores of the skin.</li>
            <li>while these products may be okay for those with some degree of skin sensitivity, it is definitely NOT for those like me who require hypoallergenic facial products -- unless swollen eyelids, hives, and blotchy red cheeks become the new standard of feminine beauty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do really feel like it&#x27;s extracting old, deep buildup.</li>
            <li>Wow.  </li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t say enough about this product.  </li>
            <li>Not only are they VERY picky about their product, their economy demands that prices remain lower than luxury products in the US.  </li>
            <li>My makeup the next day went on really well and did not get cakey at all.  </li>
            <li>At the end of this year I will be 40 years old</li>
            <li>I know because I was slaving over a hot stove after putting it all on one day and started to sweat pretty heavy.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately that is as far as my good experience can go.  </li>
            <li>It was the first winter that my face wasn&#x27;t dry and chapped.</li>
            <li>I have very dry skin around my chin and cheeks to the point where I get red blotches, and the products help calm and moisturize.</li>
            <li>My skin is freakishly sensitive to a lot of products but not 1 single problem with this product.</li>
            <li>I do not recommend this product line for anyone who has sensitive skin and especially allergic to any type of fragrance.</li>
            <li>I have bought this item directly in Korea and these products by mail did not seem to offer the same results ...</li>
            <li>but after I applied eye cream from system 6, my left eye is back to normal size.</li>
            <li>When I woke up the next day, the red blotches I normally have around my cheeks disappeared and haven&#x27;t reappeared since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After about 2 days of using the product exactly as directed, I started getting little bumps on my forehead and around my mouth.  </li>
            <li>The eye cream is going to last forever because it requires barely any product to cover the entire eye area.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I then reverted back to my previous regimen of retinol and cerave at night and laneige during the day which immediately began to calm down all of the bumps on my face.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have heard about this skin care system so I wanted to try.  My skin is still the same after 2 month of use; I was expecting something better.</li>
            <li> I buy this product locally at a Korean grocery store (it&#x27;s cheaper!!) and for the first time in my life, I have clear skin that is moisturized perfectly! I usually have oily/combination skin, but I stated using the cleanser, toner and moisturizer and my skin changed overnight. I will continue to buy this product and try out any products I can find! I highly recommend this to anyone who has problem skin and has tried everything else on the market. The cleanser alone you can feel it tingle when you wash your face with it, and that&#x27;s how you know it is working its way into your pores to get all the dirt out!</li>
            <li> I would probably rate it 5 stars if it had instructions on use in English.  I know how to use the products because my friend is Korean.</li>
            <li> To preface, I did not buy this from Amazon nor an Amazon vendor, but I thought that my point of view as an allergy-sufferer might be useful with regard to the \\&quot;good for sensitive skin\\&quot; claims of the ATOMY SKIN CARE 6 SYSTEM:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was referred to me as something fabulous for sensitive skin. That may be the case for some, but not for me. Almost immediately after application (and 6 steps/products AFTER cleansing? Seriously???), my face started tingling, then itching. After an hour or so, I noticed some hives and that the skin around my eyes started to swell. \\&quot;Terrific,\\&quot; I thought to myself as I reached for the Benadryl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then read the fine print on the ingredients list. Sure enough, the products contain added fragrance. HUGE PROBLEM!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So while these products may be okay for those with some degree of skin sensitivity, it is definitely NOT for those like me who require hypoallergenic facial products -- unless swollen eyelids, hives, and blotchy red cheeks become the new standard of feminine beauty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really, why does there have to be perfume in something that goes on the face?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very disappointed. If Atomy drops the irritating, allergy-inducing added fragrance, I may be willing to try this again. Though it *would* be nice if they made trial sizes available. It sucks to shell out a C-note for something unusable.</li>
            <li> I love this product cuz unlike other skin care products this actually gets absorbed deep into skin because the moisturizing materials are smaller than the pores of the skin. You will notice the big different in the afternoon. If you use other products , you will have grease all over your face cuz the moisturing materials can not be absorbed into your pores cuz they are bigger than your pores. Your face will feel moist all day without greasiness on your face later in the day.&lt;br /&gt;For those who experience hives in your face after using this product it&#x27;s because your pores of your face has stuff that is not supposed to be there and Atomy skin care kicks out the oily dirt that was hiding in your pores. After a few days, your face will get better. It happened to me, too.&lt;br /&gt;This is the best product in the world. They put 500 times more herbal exacts that are good for your skin where as other products can&#x27;t put more than 0.1% of herbal extract due to lack of technology. Atomy is the only company who knows how to do that.</li>
            <li> I had two sales person who tried to sell these products to me and I tried it on my hands and I got an allergic reaction . My hands started tingling, itching &amp; then swelled up and blotches of red spots, I had to immediately rinse it off. I do not recommend this product line for anyone who has sensitive skin and especially allergic to any type of fragrance. Face/skin care products are best and \\&quot;organic\\&quot; when it has no fragrance.</li>
            <li> it took quite a long time to get this delivered and considering the price 100$+, I was worried it would not arrive. but its here. I already have this product so I already love it!! this one is a gift for my sister</li>
            <li> Reasonable price and quality but i am not sure my skin</li>
            <li> Wow.  I really can&#x27;t say enough about this product.  I&#x27;ve never been a girly girl or had a skin care regimen before.  Hell, I usually go to bed with my make up still on.  I was lucky enough to be born with pretty good skin to begin with, so skincare was never a big concern of mine.  However, as I&#x27;m getting older, I&#x27;m realizing more and more that the future of my complexion rests on my choices now, so I began researching for some product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All my research said that Korean skincare is the way to go.  Not only are they VERY picky about their product, their economy demands that prices remain lower than luxury products in the US.  This particular brand came highly recommended.  I still thought the price was steep, but hey, if I didn&#x27;t like it, I could always return it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so glad I chanced it.  My skin looks like glowing perfection.  I thought I had a good complexion before, but this blew my standards out of the water.  My skin is soft, glowy (but in no way, shape, or form even remotely oily), and so smooth.  The giant strawberry nose pores I had never thought would go away are disappearing after only a week.  My make-up sticks better, my face doesn&#x27;t have that tight, dry feeling most product causes, and even the slight redness in my face has gone away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself has a very nice, very light herbal smell.  The toner doesn&#x27;t sting at all, and one pump glides over your face.  The essence is very soothing and blurs a lot of the imperfections and fine lines on my face.  The lotion is light and NEVER feels heavy or sticky and it all absorbs incredibly fast.  The bb cream has a light, natural color that blends beautifully and gives your face a bright, dewy finish.  It also works really well as a primer if you want to use a powder or matte finish foundation.  The eye cream is going to last forever because it requires barely any product to cover the entire eye area.  The heavier night cream is still light and really refreshes the skin after scrubbing the day&#x27;s makeup away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff really does absorb into your skin.  I know because I was slaving over a hot stove after putting it all on one day and started to sweat pretty heavy.  I realized I was sweating the stuff OUT of my skin, and not OFF of my skin.  Gross sounding, I know, but as long as you give it plenty of time before you run a marathon or try to cook a feast for 10 people in 90 degree weather, it doesn&#x27;t sweat out.  Still, it was nice to know that it&#x27;s actually getting into my skin, and not just sitting on top to be wiped away worthlessly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The TL;DR version of this post is this:  BUY THIS STUFF!  It&#x27;s incredible!</li>
            <li> My skin is freakishly sensitive to a lot of products but not 1 single problem with this product. I have only good things to report, improved tone and texture and more balanced appearance of skin color. My skin drinks it up and actually appears more radiant than I have seen it in years.</li>
            <li> Great Product.  I do not always use them in the order that is required, but I do use the lotions as necessary.  I wish that they all contained the same amount of product.</li>
            <li> I tried Atomy serum and my face broke out, but I continued using, since it could be from die off syndrome, where toxins coming out of the skin.  After 1 week’s use, it did not happen, and my skin is tighter than ever with diminished wrinkles around the eyes.</li>
            <li> I tried the skincare 6 step system.  After looking at the ingredients, I found that for the most part nothing made me nervous except for the alcohol in the toner, however, I was really excited since I have used some Korean products in the past.  At first, the product went on smoothly and felt very hydrating.  I was a little worried about the fragrance since I have ridiculously sensitive skin more recent than ever, but since I&#x27;ve had excellent experiences with prior Korean products I continued forth.  My makeup the next day went on really well and did not get cakey at all.  Unfortunately that is as far as my good experience can go.  After about 2 days of using the product exactly as directed, I started getting little bumps on my forehead and around my mouth.  I shrugged it off as possible purging and continued the product.  The next day the bumps got a little worse and also blind pimples were forming (pimples with no head). I then reverted back to my previous regimen of retinol and cerave at night and laneige during the day which immediately began to calm down all of the bumps on my face.  After 3 days of non-use, the bumps on my forehead are virtually gone, but the pimples and clogged pores around my mouth and cheek are lingering.  Maybe I switched products too soon and too much or something in the product disagrees with my skin.  I am going to give it one more try since I don&#x27;t want my mother to feel bad that her miracle product didn&#x27;t work on me.  This time, I am going to introduce the products slowly but I think I will wait until all of the bumps have disappeared.</li>
            <li> At the end of this year I will be 40 years old but most people will think that I would be around my early 30. I have been using System 6 for more than a year now, I am using Evening 4 at the same time and I found that my skin is smoother, tighter and I don&#x27;t have any wrinkle at all. My left eye was half size of my right eye before because of the heavy wrinkle but after I applied eye cream from system 6, my left eye is back to normal size. I wish I could post the photo for the difference.&lt;br /&gt;For people who are using system 6 and didn&#x27;t see the immediate result, I don&#x27;t know what kind of cleansing products that you are using, please use Evening 4 for the best result. System 6 will fix your skin products only you need to wait a little bit longer based on your skin situation and I will say System 6 is the best product that I have used.</li>
            <li> My mom got me this as a gift. The first use was great and I almost saw instantaneous results. My skin was glowy and smooth and felt hydrated and happy. When I woke up the next day, the red blotches I normally have around my cheeks disappeared and haven&#x27;t reappeared since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m about a week into use and like most of the other reviews stated, I&#x27;m starting to break out. I have small, hard bumps, sort of like blackheads, primarily covering my cheeks and between my brows. Being the way I am, I picked at one and pulled out the head, revealing a deep hole in my forehead. I do really feel like it&#x27;s extracting old, deep buildup. I do feel like the pores around my nose on my cheeks are getting bigger, but they look clean. I don&#x27;t know how else to describe it. It&#x27;s sort of like when you use a pore strip on your nose and after you pull everything out and look closely you see those tiny holes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note though, I apply a fuller coverage foundation over the BB cream during the day and I find the foundation sits better and less cakey if you let the BB cream and the rest of the products sink in for an hour or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep you posted on the progress. Today&#x27;s date is August 4th, 2014.</li>
            <li> I have bought this item directly in Korea and these products by mail did not seem to offer the same results ...</li>
            <li> I started using this set about a week ago after it was recommended to me. I&#x27;m in my late 20&#x27;s with fair, very sensitive combination skin, and I&#x27;ve been searching for quality skincare products to protect and prevent before my skin starts to show signs of aging. This set is great-- The price might seem a little steep, but you really get a lot of product. It&#x27;s very helpful how the set includes everything you need. All the products absorb pretty fast, and with each layer, my skin gets silkier and silkier. I have very dry skin around my chin and cheeks to the point where I get red blotches, and the products help calm and moisturize. I use the regimen at night with more of the heavy cream than I would during the day, and I wake up with radiant skin in the morning. During the day, I skip the heavy cream and use the BB cream instead, which is tinted-- It turns my face into a flawless canvas for foundation and other color make up. My skin stays moisturized all day, but my T-zone still stays matte. And as a plus, they have a light floral scent to them that I find very pleasant. I am in love, and will continue using every one of these products.</li>
            <li> A friend recommended this product, we have used a different product from Beverly Hills, and my skin was flawless/ I used this product twice had a reaction of bumps around my cheek line</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month.Atomy leaves my skin perfectly moisturized all day. The tiny bumps I used to get on my skin are disappearing. I&#x27;m not sure about the wrinkles yet, but I still love the products and the price!</li>
            <li> This is very nice products.  Good quality for your face and made of herbs.  Black spot, ache goes away gradually when I use it and also it is very fair and cheap price.  However, the quality is better the products selling at the mall.</li>
            <li> I used this product all last winter. It was a gift from a friend. It was the first winter that my face wasn&#x27;t dry and chapped. Heavenly!! I&#x27;ve got my daughters using it now.</li>
            <li> Delivery was faster than I thought! I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product but it&#x27;s been very disappointing. I purchased the deep cleanser along with this and started using all of them as instructed. The cleanser felt like I was depositing product on my face and these 6 products followed suit. I literally felt like I was just using cream after cream after cream. The Toner didn&#x27;t tingle as toners are commonly known to do so I wondered if it was even working. The BB cream look like an SPF mask that just sat on my face. My makeup couldn&#x27;t cover it so I had to wipe it off. After 2 tries, i stopped using the BB cream. After using this line I actually broke out. I continued using it thinking that it was just getting out toxins and it would get better. No such luck!! I continued to break out so I think my theory of cream after cream on my face was right. I also noticed that while using this line, by the end of the day, my face was oilier than usual. Disappointed!! and now I have all these full bottles that will end up in the trash!!</li>
            <li> This product is awesome. It&#x27;s really good for the skin.</li>
            <li> I started using the skincare line about 3 weeks ago and I love it. I could see a difference in my skin within the first week. I have recommended this product to 2 other friends of mine and they love it as well. I would recommend to anyone to try this product. I was previously using Estee Lauder products and I was very pleased with them so to switch to another product was not an easy choice but I am very glad I did - so is my wallet! Much more affordable. With that being said, when i see these products being advertised on Amazon, Ebay, etc... I have to say BE WARE! The company has a strict guideline that representatives cannot sell on these websites. In turn what is happening is that people that need a refund are not getting it because the people that are selling these on these sights cannot offer it to you OR you have no idea how long the products have been sitting before you buy them. This site says delivery is weeks away. When you go to the Atomy website, you should get your shipment with a few days. That is because the ones that are advertising on these sites are waiting until they get a bunch of people ordering them so they can get a better deal on the products. If you only buy 1 kit from Atomy it is $159 but if you buy 3 or more you get it for $89 each. The best way is to just to become a member which is FREE and no obligation to buy monthly - you order as you go. This way you cut out the middle man and you can take advantage of all of the other products they have as well. AND before anyone wants to say it - YES- I have been so pleased with Atomy products, I decided to become a member and I have saved a ton of money for top quality products that if I bought anywhere else, I would be paying a fortune for. Just thought I would those of you who want to listen. Take it for what it&#x27;s worth and do yourself a favor- cut out the middle man on this one.</li>
