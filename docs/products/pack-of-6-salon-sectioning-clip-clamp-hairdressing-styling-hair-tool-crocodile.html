            <li> Cheap and work great!</li>
            <li> Totally worth the wait. They make blow drying and flat ironing my hair much easier. I have curly frizzy hair. These are a must lol</li>
            <li> Easily holds a large amount of my very thick hair.</li>
            <li> Very nice ! Light weight.</li>
            <li> These clips hold my thick hair very snugly with no hair loss once I remove them. I use these on my natural hair during blowing and also straightening. Never have stray hair in the way. Took awhile to get here but it&#x27;s understandable since they were shipped from Asia. Happy customer.</li>
            <li> Do not order from this seller took forever to receive a literal month. Could not cancel very frustrating. Also I think they are hard to use  they are to long and make it hard to dry your hair in sections with out hitting the clips.  Better to use the claw clips</li>
            <li> These work how they are supposed to.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping, I received them much sooner than I could have imagined! Thank you and the product is exactly as described and I can&#x27;t wait to use them.</li>
            <li> They are easy to grip, even with wet hands, and I love how effectively they hold the hair without tugging on or snagging the hair.</li>
            <li> Just received this product but I am sure it will be perfect</li>
            <li> great price, great product&lt;br /&gt;worth the wait</li>
            <li> Very durable, love them</li>
            <li> Love these! Great quality and price! Fast shipping too!</li>
            <li> I love my Salon Sectioning clips. Wow they did a beautiful job holding my hair section, allowing me to properly color my hair. They did their job and the color is fun. They even came ahead of scheduled delivery time. Not over packaged. I bought two packages of clips it is always better to have spares when you find something you really like. Buy them and have better color results.</li>
            <li> Love the the grip is magnificent</li>
            <li> Cool clips i like the color they are great for cliping off hair when u are doing it itwas worth the money</li>
            <li> Love them ...controls the hair</li>
            <li> I purchased these clips for the purpose of work. Let me say, I bought them without realizing that I was buying Toni&amp;Guy sectioning clips. The price is excellent for the clips and the amount I get. I love that I can easily open these clips, so it makes my work a bit faster. As well I can easily section hair with them without worrying that it would get tangled in customer&#x27;s hair. They&#x27;re excellent for hairdresser or even anyone who needs good clips that can hold either big sections or thick hair. They&#x27;re good quality clips that are worth buying.</li>
            <li> Big enough to hold my hair during curling.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> Handy and great hold. However it is shipped from overseas so don&#x27;t expect &amp;#34;prime shipping&amp;#34; speed.</li>
            <li> This things are great, yes it takes long to receive but it it stated as a note when you&#x27;re reviewing the item.  They are hard? yes, thats the way they should be if you want them to handle hair ( specially african and or persian hair) I&#x27;m a cosmetologist and this are the only ones than have been able to get the job done.  Your finger hurst? like i said they need to be hard to be able to hand great amounts of hair, long, thick and any kind of hair.</li>
