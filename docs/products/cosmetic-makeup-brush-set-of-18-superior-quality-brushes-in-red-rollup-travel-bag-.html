            <li>The case is nice too and it helps keep everything organized and clutter free on the bathroom sink counter.</li>

            <li>The brushes are so soft and they smell nice!</li>
            <li>To be honest, I was apprehensive about the quality of these brushes at first.</li>
            <li>Being my first brush set, I was thrilled with the result.</li>

            <li>Easy to clean and is compact</li>
            <li>It came with a picture guide to the brushes that really came in handy.</li>

            <li>These brushes are fantastic.</li>
            <li>Every brush look fabulous and good quality - the perfect combination of soft and fluffy.</li>

            <li>you for providing this and being reputable so that I could look like I knew what I was doing all along ;)</li>
            <li>I was given a sample of these brushes, and first up I have to say the leather pouch is stunning</li>
            <li>This Makeup Brushes Set are lovely and very high quality</li>
            <li>Not only are the brushes good quality</li>
            <li>Would definitely recommend these to anyone looking for a good set.</li>
            <li>And the gorgeous, red leather bag that rolls up to protect them</li>
            <li>I read the previous reviews and was pleased to see that these were good quality.</li>
            <li>The red foldable pouch was beautiful and very classy.</li>
            <li>Very soft brushes with a greater seller that ships quickly.</li>
            <li>These brushes are super soft and there are so many of them to choose from...</li>
            <li>The brushes are great and not cheap, they dont shed every time i use them!</li>
            <li>The red case is very compact for so many brushes!</li>
            <li>Cant believe they were less the $25.00 and just as good</li>
            <li>/&gt;The brushes came extremely quickly and were packaged really well.</li>
            <li>Love the red.</li>
            <li>You did a great job choosing the brushes for the Delicate Caress Range.</li>
            <li>This arrived on time and was exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>But once I had the opportunity to use the brushes I was surprised at the quality of the brushes for such an amazing price, plus the red is fabulous!</li>
            <li>Every brush is of fabulous quality - the perfect combination of soft and fluffy or stiff and full for each one&#x27;s intended purpose.</li>
            <li>I now know why she takes so long getting ready to go out:)</li>
            <li>the handles feel sturdy and the bristles are super soft.</li>
            <li>and I would definitely recommend these to anyone who is looking for an affordable and fine quality</li>
            <li>so doesn&#x27;t take up to much room in bag.  </li>
            <li>This was a very comprehensive set of brushes....</li>
            <li>But because I bought this as a gift, I really wish it would have came in a box.</li>
            <li>work very well</li>
            <li>They arrived in a few business days, wrapped and placed in a nice box.</li>
            <li>From ELF and Ecotools to a very expensive set from Sephora, these are the very best powder and blending brushes I&#x27;ve ever</li>
            <li>Better than expected!!</li>
            <li>Decent set of brushes for the price I paid at the time.</li>
            <li>Would recommend highly.</li>
            <li>Soft, well-made, no shedding!</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>would say that when we received the Caress 18 piece set, it came in a pretty fancy red leather case, just like the picture showed.</li>
            <li>The brushes themselves are very high quality, I was about to buy one single brush in Sephora a few days ago for $15 but the value in this package makes me glad I didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had any problems with them shedding so far.</li>
            <li>and they are indeed incredibly soft.</li>
            <li>So far, no shedding from what I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t recommend it highly enough, particularly for the listed price.</li>
            <li>wife is pretty picky when it comes to her personal care items, products, sets and such, so I knew that I had to do my research and shopping with some care, or I would just be wasting my money.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>She especially likes the natural fiber brushes.</li>
            <li>Much nicer than I expected.  </li>
            <li>I use for personal and professional use on a daily basis and have found no fault.</li>

            <li> , long story short, I am a hero.</li>
            <li> The presentation of the brushes is great, but several of the brushes shed a lot which is very annoying.</li>
            <li> I was browsing around for a set for a few days, and these caught my eye instantly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Money well spent, that my bottom line.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The brushes are okay, but I am disappointed with the quality of the pouch.</li>
            <li> and now my Mum and other relatives might be buying sets for themselves.</li>
            <li> The quality surpassed any brand I&#x27;ve used and even after a hard washing they dried well and are back to being used everyday.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife as a little add on gift for her birthday</li>
            <li> bought a set a few days ago for my sister&#x27;s birthday since she is also a brush</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever use each one, just the usual everyday ones.</li>
            <li> if not better then ones that you would spend 100 on.</li>
            <li> so unfortunately i won&#x27;t get the chance to try them out.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m somewhat disappointed</li>

            <li> Great seller. Brushes are amazing!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife as a little add on gift for her birthday and she loves it. She especially likes the natural fiber brushes. With all the choices (18 different brushes) I now know why she takes so long getting ready to go out:) Okay I&#x27;m not going to  pretend I understand the art of make-up but  she is happy with them and that is what it is all about.</li>
            <li> I boughts for my family and they love it brush set because most of place are expensive found with all set in one.</li>
            <li> Great Product! Very Happy with quality and cost. I use for personal and professional use on a daily basis and have found no fault. Easy to clean and is compact so doesn&#x27;t take up to much room in bag.  Would recommend highly.</li>
            <li> I was very impressed by the quality of these brushes for the price. Soft, well-made, no shedding! Watch for sales - mine were a steal!</li>
            <li> wife is happy with these make up brushes and that all it matters, good product at a good price, recommended.</li>
            <li> This was a very comprehensive set of brushes....every type of brush you would ever need. The red case is very compact for so many brushes! My wife loves them and takes them on all her business trips now :-)</li>
            <li> I bought this for my sister as a gift and she loves it. Not only are the brushes good quality but you get a bunch of them. To top it off you get a very beautiful case to put them in. Can&#x27;t ask for anything more.</li>
            <li> I would recommend these brushes to any make-up artist or anyone just looking to have great brushes for application. Beautiful set.</li>
            <li> They are what they say they are and more. Cant believe they were less the $25.00 and just as good if not better then ones that you would spend 100 on.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love these brushes! I was browsing around for a set for a few days, and these caught my eye instantly. I didn&#x27;t want anything too cheap, and the reviews were really good on this set. They arrived in a few business days, wrapped and placed in a nice box. The case is just like the picture. Love the red. The brushes are so soft and they smell nice! I haven&#x27;t had any problems with them shedding so far. I am very satisfied!</li>
            <li> Very soft brushes with a greater seller that ships quickly. Only have used them for a couple weeks but have not had any issues. Wish an angle powder brush was also included. Would purchase again!</li>
            <li> I bought these for my mom, she loves them. I read the previous reviews and was pleased to see that these were good quality. They are just as described. The color is fantastic and the brushes feel wonderful. It came with a picture guide to the brushes that really came in handy. Would definitely recommend these to anyone looking for a good set.</li>
            <li> The presentation of the brushes is great, but several of the brushes shed a lot which is very annoying. So I&#x27;m somewhat disappointed, I will continue to use the brushes, but this set will not be my staple set.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush set as a gift - so unfortunately i won&#x27;t get the chance to try them out. but the case is nice, the brushes themselves, seem like good quality.  the handles feel sturdy and the bristles are super soft. hell - i almost want to order myself a set. But because I bought this as a gift, I really wish it would have came in a box. overall, i am happy with the purchase. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> This Makeup Brushes Set are lovely and very high quality product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a set a few days ago for my sister&#x27;s birthday since she is also a brush lover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They work very well and they are indeed incredibly soft. Great product for on the go travel!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And she loves Red, so it was a perfect match!</li>
            <li> These brushes are fantastic. They did not shed when I tested them. The bristles are very soft and the brushes that needed to be stiffer for use as contour or crease shadowing or applying eyeliner are the perfect density and stiffness. I am very pleased with the quality and the selection. I am sending the link from Amazon of these brushes to my sister who is always looking for a great value and I would definitely recommend these to anyone who is looking for an affordable and fine quality make up brush set.  Thank you Denise at Nodnoclodge! You did a great job choosing the brushes for the Delicate Caress Range.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT product! I received this brush set as a gift from a friend and it&#x27;s absolutely perfect! Every brush look fabulous and good quality - the perfect combination of soft and fluffy. So far, no shedding from what I&#x27;ve seen. I woul totally recommend this to my friends and good price for good brushes!</li>
            <li> Excellent service and delivery time!!  The brushes are okay, but I am disappointed with the quality of the pouch.</li>
            <li> I was so impressed with how fast I received this brush set after submitting my order first off! But once I had the opportunity to use the brushes I was surprised at the quality of the brushes for such an amazing price, plus the red is fabulous! Great quality for the price, it&#x27;s a must have for yourself, or it will make an awesome gift for women!!</li>
            <li> This arrived on time and was exactly as described.  It is nicely packaged in its own case and perfect for travel.  The larger brushes are protected with a plastic cover.  Thank you for a great product and great follow up on whether the brushes arrived as promised.</li>
            <li> Much nicer than I expected.  The quality is excellent and there is a brush for every purpose  all wrapped in a very nice roll bag.</li>
            <li> Better than expected!!</li>
            <li> These brushes are super soft and there are so many of them to choose from... I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever use each one, just the usual everyday ones. But if you like to play around and try a lot different makeup tricks, this is the set for you! The case is nice too and it helps keep everything organized and clutter free on the bathroom sink counter. Overall it&#x27;s a great value.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes they are really nice and love the color of the carrying case, I also really like the fact that I can just grab the case and go</li>
            <li> Wow! What can I say? To be honest, I was apprehensive about the quality of these brushes at first. I had never heard of the company but wanted to know more and was impressed by the price! Being my first brush set, I was thrilled with the result. I have purchased all different individual brushes to do makeup. From ELF and Ecotools to a very expensive set from Sephora, these are the very best powder and blending brushes I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes came extremely quickly and were packaged really well. Each brush was individually packaged and there were brush guards included. The red foldable pouch was beautiful and very classy. I especially loved the tassels. There are 18 brushes total and they include face brushes, eye brushes, a foundation brush, eyelash brushes, and a liner brush. I waited to review here on Amazon in case the brushes ended up shedding everywhere but they didn&#x27;t! The quality surpassed any brand I&#x27;ve used and even after a hard washing they dried well and are back to being used everyday. Although I like Sephora&#x27;s stippling brush, these brushes are just as great of quality and the price can&#x27;t be beat!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I purchased these brushes I shared with my friends this phenomenal deal and now my Mum and other relatives might be buying sets for themselves. Just today I have a makeup party with all of my friends and the brushes stood up great to everyone using them. There really isn&#x27;t anything I disliked about the set and they look nice on my vanity. If you&#x27;re interested in getting into makeup or are a pro, try out these brushes and be happy with your purchase!</li>
            <li> The brushes are soft and are wonderful. Great price for great quality! Very pleased!</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT product! I received this brush set as a gift and it&#x27;s absolutely perfect! Every brush is of fabulous quality - the perfect combination of soft and fluffy or stiff and full for each one&#x27;s intended purpose. I&#x27;ve been using the two largest brushes for contouring, blushing, and blending every day since I received it and they work beautifully! The eyeshadow brushes are all awesome, as well. And the gorgeous, red leather bag that rolls up to protect them all makes this set perfect for traveling. I couldn&#x27;t have asked for a better brush set and I can&#x27;t recommend it highly enough, particularly for the listed price.</li>
            <li> I got these as a gift and love love them!!! The carry case is very easy to travel with keeps everything in place and looks $$$! The brushes are great and not cheap, they dont shed every time i use them! I will tell all my friends about this product...</li>
            <li> Woow. These brushes for a good price. Count. Me. IN! Very satisfied with them and would probably buy another set for someone.</li>
            <li> My wife had been shopping for a set of cosmetic makeup brushes when I found these at Amazon (by the way, I love this site). I am so glad that I made the decision to purchase the Caress brand of brushes.&lt;br /&gt;My wife is pretty picky when it comes to her personal care items, products, sets and such, so I knew that I had to do my research and shopping with some care, or I would just be wasting my money.&lt;br /&gt;Well, long story short, I am a hero. this set of brushes is a great collection that she can use in all the various ways that women do. I don&#x27;t pretend to know all the fine details of that, I just know that my wife is happy...so I&#x27;m happy.&lt;br /&gt;Money well spent, that my bottom line.&lt;br /&gt;I would say that when we received the Caress 18 piece set, it came in a pretty fancy red leather case, just like the picture showed. I was wondering if I would get what the picture promised, and I did.&lt;br /&gt;This brush set is quality all the way, and like I said, I am very pleased that everything worked out perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for providing this and being reputable so that I could look like I knew what I was doing all along ;)</li>
            <li> I was given a sample of these brushes, and first up I have to say the leather pouch is stunning, I felt like a movie star opening it.  The brushes themselves are very high quality, I was about to buy one single brush in Sephora a few days ago for $15 but the value in this package makes me glad I didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;I love the way my mineral make up smooths on with the foundation brush and there is no clumping on my skin, the eye-shadow brushes are very accurate and give an awesome blended finish. The lip brush stays on the lips and no stray hairs so no weeping trail, that&#x27;s important when you are more \\&quot;mature\\&quot;. I didn&#x27;t try all the brushes, however I have thrown out my trusty Body Shop collection and now have these, pride of place in my bathroom. Best of all I have the leather case for when I travel, so they will stay clean and dry.</li>
            <li> Decent set of brushes for the price I paid at the time.</li>
