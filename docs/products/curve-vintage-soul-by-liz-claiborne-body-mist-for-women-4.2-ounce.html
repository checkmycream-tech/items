            <li>Hi.....  Exceptionally pleased with this order from start to finish!</li>
            <li>It smells amazing.</li>
            <li>Fragrance is subjective, so this might be nice to some people.</li>
            <li>Packaged  nicely so it wouldn&#x27;t spill or leak.  </li>
            <li>Great price &amp; received it quickly.</li>
            <li>I was sorta hesitant because a lot of reviews said this was a very strong fragrance.</li>
            <li>In all honesty,with this fragrance, I liked the name : )</li>
            <li>It really is a way to smell beautiful without spending a fortune.</li>
            <li>Despite the leaking reviews, this arrived very securely.</li>
            <li>I just want to try more</li>
            <li>It smells delightful but it doesn&#x27;t last all day.</li>
            <li>I never knew this existed in my favorite fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Love this ...</li>
            <li>I know that it will be enjoyed by whom we bought it for.</li>
            <li>My favorite to this day....</li>
            <li>I love this perfume.</li>
            <li>I love the scent of Curve Vintage Soul</li>
            <li>This product is one of my all time favorite body mists.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this scent and my honey loves it too.</li>
            <li>I plan on ordering more.</li>
            <li>I would order more and give it out as Christmas presents</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found my \\&quot;new\\&quot; signature scent : )</li>
            <li>I love</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to purchase more curve scents from liz</li>
            <li>I also love Curve Crush, Curve and Curve Kicks..</li>
            <li>the curve soul smells alot better gave it to my husban to wear and he needs to wear just alittle</li>
            <li>Very unique.  </li>
            <li>Nothing compared to the original curve soul which has become one of my favorite perfumes.  </li>
            <li>I have allergies and found it to be too strong.</li>
            <li>It is a bit strong for some</li>
            <li>If you are into strong fragrances, I would suggest that you try this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d also say it&#x27;s nice for all seasons, except for hot days.</li>
            <li>Everything seemed fine until I started to spray myself and the bottle began to leak.</li>
            <li>I admit, upon first smell, it was very strong.</li>
            <li>Sure this product is worth $5-$7</li>
            <li>I love it sooo much will purchase more</li>
            <li>I purchased it originally in Century 21 when they sold it in the stores</li>
            <li>, Grand Bahama has this available for sale and its a nice romantic scent</li>
            <li>The price is more than reasonable.</li>
            <li>I was shopping for my boyfriend&#x27;s Curve for Men (as a present) and figured if his smelled so good, then I&#x27;d check out Curve fragrances for women.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Though Curve Vintage Soul may have many of the same ingredients, it is more of a dusky scent.</li>
            <li>It lasts adequately -- lingers on the clothing, doesn&#x27;t fade too swiftly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I gave it 4 out of 5 only because I&#x27;m sure there is always something better (and</li>
            <li>I have always wanted Curve but every time i wanted it was sold out at walmart, 4 stars is worth it.</li>
            <li>this is by far my favorite . .</li>
            <li>smells nice and will last all day . .</li>
            <li>I went off the reviews and they were frankly not the reviews for the right product CURVE VINTAGE SOUL</li>
            <li>Smells good but its a lot stronger than I expected so be very generous putting this on</li>
            <li>and of course, same great body mist, and @ such an affordable price...  Certainly will be ordering again for Christmas.  </li>
            <li>Will be looking for more in the future.</li>
            <li>First smelled it on a coworker and tried it in this spray.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft and clean...</li>
            <li>Overall, LOVE THIS and HIGHLY recommend.</li>
            <li>Smells really good n last long.</li>
            <li>She says it gives a certain boost of confidence and the scent itself is quite invigorating.</li>
            <li>So, I certainly would recommend giving it a try.</li>
            <li>Thanks again for the bargain.</li>
            <li>I expected better...</li>
            <li>I also am very picky about fragrance.</li>
            <li>I honestly don&#x27;t really like the smell of it</li>
            <li>My daughters likes them smell and how it fits in the book bags with out taking up that much space..</li>
            <li>so I just put it in another empty spray bottle after washig and drying it and finished enjoying it.</li>
            <li>but the service was fast</li>
            <li>I will admit that when first applied it is a little strong, but after a sec or two it mellows out into a nice fragrance.</li>
            <li>But, other than that, I will be ordering more of this perfume.</li>
            <li>I do notice that when I push down on the pump, it can leak a bit, but I still love it.</li>
            <li>Not that anyone said anything either way while at work, but while working, I loved smelling the subtle hints of my new purchase.</li>
            <li>Everytime I buy it online though, it comes in a plastic bottle with a leaky top which is not cool because I travel alot and have to ensure it can&#x27;t move.</li>
            <li>At first, when I smelled it on my GF, it was a bit spicy and strong, but when she sprayed it on after shower and washed off (to get it right to the dry down stage)...</li>
            <li>even though my GF is far from being romantic, even she could appreciate \\&quot;a gently spiced up vintage touch</li>
            <li>Smells like an old lady should be wearing this scent.</li>
            <li>When I say old lady</li>
            <li>Buying this kind of stuff in any boutique in Manhattan would mean paying a double.</li>
            <li>I might like a certain ingredient in one type of fragrance but may consider myself highly offended by same ingredient in a different fragrance.</li>
            <li>I have been searching for a new fragrance that didn&#x27;t knock people over just standing next to them!</li>
            <li>Cheap knock-offs tend to be short lasting, or have an odd after odor.</li>
            <li>Try something better than this because this is not good for younger women</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;ve only found it online.</li>
            <li>Smells a little &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34;, will not be my everyday favorite.  </li>

            <li> Smell doesn&#x27;t last long, but I like the scent.</li>
            <li> Not only received order DAYS before they promised delivery, items were packed sooo carefully,</li>
            <li> Smells terrible at first, like Jean Nate, but settles down nicely.  </li>
            <li> I did my homework and read other customer reviews.</li>
            <li> So per other customer reviews, I used just a couple of spritz&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s harsh, herbal, strong and really unpleasant.</li>
            <li> My both sisters and grandmother put down whatever scent they were using and started using this.</li>
            <li> The spritzer is a little leaky.</li>
            <li> Cheap, annoying smell.</li>
            <li> Upon further investigation...the sprayer seemed broken b/c each time I sprayed the perfume on me...it would leak.</li>
            <li> I always keep spare small spray bottles, so I just transferred the Mist into one of those.  </li>
            <li> It conjures up ideas of sultry romance, late nights beneath of a starry sky.</li>
            <li> Icky poo</li>
            <li> I mean over 65.</li>
            <li> This body mist is musky and subtle.</li>
            <li> something seems to be broken.....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m someone&#x27;s (secret pal) at my church</li>
            <li> This is another typical case of blind purchase gone bad.</li>
            <li> Such a horrible scent!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the plastic bottles they are shipped in are, well, crap....  </li>
            <li> so awful</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> I love it sooo much will purchase more I will use it forever!!!.very good piece.I just want to try more</li>
            <li> Great Body Mist! It smells delightful but it doesn&#x27;t last all day.</li>
            <li> If you want a perfume that does not need reapplying through out the day, this is for you! I will admit that when first applied it is a little strong, but after a sec or two it mellows out into a nice fragrance. The price is great also, and it arrived within the scheduled delivery time. The only problem is that when sprayed, the product does leak some. But, other than that, I will be ordering more of this perfume.</li>
            <li> Fragrance is subjective, so this might be nice to some people. I have allergies and found it to be too strong.</li>
            <li> I never knew this existed in my favorite fragrance.  Despite the leaking reviews, this arrived very securely. I do notice that when I push down on the pump, it can leak a bit, but I still love it.</li>
            <li> Smells good but its a lot stronger than I expected so be very generous putting this on or you could get a headache or give a headache to others lol.</li>
            <li> Smells like alcohol and not a body mist. Try something better than this because this is not good for younger women</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mother and it finished in no time at all. My both sisters and grandmother put down whatever scent they were using and started using this. It smells amazing.</li>
            <li> I have always wanted Curve but every time i wanted it was sold out at walmart, 4 stars is worth it.</li>
            <li> Love this ...it smells wonderful!! Packaged  nicely so it wouldn&#x27;t spill or leak.  I know that it will be enjoyed by whom we bought it for. No problems with transaction or delivery ...definetly recommend!</li>
            <li> Smells like an old lady should be wearing this scent. When I say old lady I mean over 65. No offense to anyone out there.</li>
            <li> This is a great deal  and a lot cheaper than purchasing it in the stores. Thanks again for the bargain.</li>
            <li> Would love to purchase the perfume, but still too expensive online.  So, I opted for the Mist...  This is the best fragrance I&#x27;ve ever experienced....I wish they&#x27;d put it back in stores!!!!!  It&#x27;s soft and clean...men or women could wear it.  Very unique.  Forever getting compliments on this one.  Unfortunately, the plastic bottles they are shipped in are, well, crap....  The atomizers don&#x27;t work...they leak....something seems to be broken.....I always keep spare small spray bottles, so I just transferred the Mist into one of those.  Or go to the Container Store, they have all kinds of bottles.....  No harm, no foul.  My favorite to this day....</li>
            <li> I have been using this product since 2005 when I bought it on a whim and loved it. Everytime I buy it online though, it comes in a plastic bottle with a leaky top which is not cool because I travel alot and have to ensure it can&#x27;t move.</li>
            <li> Cheap, annoying smell. I wanted to return it immediately, but it was against the policy, as it&#x27;s flammable. So, I appreciate the refund from Amazon.</li>
            <li> The wife loved it.  Just what she was looking for.  Will be looking for more in the future.</li>
            <li> I have no idea what I was thinking with this one.. I went off the reviews and they were frankly not the reviews for the right product CURVE VINTAGE SOUL smell so awful I literally gagged after spraying. Nothing compared to the original curve soul which has become one of my favorite perfumes.  But I&#x27;d recommend staying away from vintage...</li>
            <li> Purchased this item for an event give away in a bundle...and heard good words about it</li>
            <li> I love this perfume. smells so good...lol</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start this by noting that I have tirelessly been searching for a cheaper, but similar version of CK&#x27;s Euphoria for women. Cheap knock-offs tend to be short lasting, or have an odd after odor. After looking across a website that suggested perfumes by similarity of content, I came across this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though Curve Vintage Soul may have many of the same ingredients, it is more of a dusky scent. It conjures up ideas of sultry romance, late nights beneath of a starry sky. It lasts adequately -- lingers on the clothing, doesn&#x27;t fade too swiftly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only problem I&#x27;ve encountered is finding this in local stores. So far, I&#x27;ve only found it online.</li>
            <li> Icky poo...don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> I expected better... Scent does not last and the bottle leaks everytime it is sprayed.</li>
            <li> Smells terrible at first, like Jean Nate, but settles down nicely.  Smells a little &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34;, will not be my everyday favorite.  The spritzer is a little leaky.</li>
            <li> I love the scent of Curve Vintage Soul its alluring smell is very warm and captivating. I would recommend to my famly an friends. I had no dislikes about this product.this.curve soul vintage is something I would try again</li>
            <li> Very interesting bouquet. At first, when I smelled it on my GF, it was a bit spicy and strong, but when she sprayed it on after shower and washed off (to get it right to the dry down stage)... very romantic scent, smoooooth, like a fancy caramel liquor blended with white cranberry and peach, a bit flowery too, but even though my GF is far from being romantic, even she could appreciate \\&quot;a gently spiced up vintage touch...\\&quot; She says it gives a certain boost of confidence and the scent itself is quite invigorating. I&#x27;d also say it&#x27;s nice for all seasons, except for hot days. Sure this product is worth $5-$7 delivered to my door. Buying this kind of stuff in any boutique in Manhattan would mean paying a double. So, I certainly would recommend giving it a try. I gave it 4 out of 5 only because I&#x27;m sure there is always something better (and pricier too).</li>
            <li> This product is one of my all time favorite body mists.  I purchased it originally in Century 21 when they sold it in the stores but they have since discontinued this line so I buy it through Amazon.  I miss it when I don&#x27;t have it because it has a beautiful scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m someone&#x27;s (secret pal) at my church so I made she a gift basket; With a watch, fragrances and snacks that she loves</li>
            <li> this is by far my favorite . . smells nice and will last all day . . get compliments from it and my daughter now uses it tooo</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the scent, got it as a b-day gift for my Sweetpea&#x27;s birthday. She loved it. Great price &amp; received it quickly.</li>
            <li> I love this product. No one else in Freeport, Grand Bahama has this available for sale and its a nice romantic scent</li>
            <li> love this !!!everyone always says&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;You smell GOOD!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; i say i know :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TY&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;love this !!!everyone always says /&amp;#34;You smell GOOD!&amp;#34; i say i know :D TY</li>
            <li> I love this scent and my honey loves it too. It is a bit strong for some but I like it and it lasts all day.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t smell good,the fragrance didn&#x27;t last.infact I don&#x27;t like this product.waste of money I won&#x27;t order it again never</li>
            <li> Smells really good n last long. You don&#x27;t need a lot. I plan on ordering more. The price is more than reasonable. I would order more and give it out as Christmas presents but I don&#x27;t want anyone smelling like me...</li>
            <li> I found it! I have been searching for a new fragrance that didn&#x27;t knock people over just standing next to them! Curve Vintage Soul is it! AND, it&#x27;s a &amp;#34;body mist&amp;#34;, but acts like a perfume! The only problem us a leaky pump. So, I just take the &amp;#34;dribbles&amp;#34; and dab it on my wrists!</li>
            <li> Hi.....  Exceptionally pleased with this order from start to finish! Not only received order DAYS before they promised delivery, items were packed sooo carefully, and of course, same great body mist, and @ such an affordable price...  Certainly will be ordering again for Christmas.  Thank-you,  M. Pezz</li>
            <li> I was shopping for my boyfriend&#x27;s Curve for Men (as a present) and figured if his smelled so good, then I&#x27;d check out Curve fragrances for women. In all honesty,with this fragrance, I liked the name : ) I did my homework and read other customer reviews. I was sorta hesitant because a lot of reviews said this was a very strong fragrance. Use once for the day and you&#x27;re done. I also am very picky about fragrance. I might like a certain ingredient in one type of fragrance but may consider myself highly offended by same ingredient in a different fragrance. I admit, upon first smell, it was very strong. So per other customer reviews, I used just a couple of spritz&#x27;s. I wore it to work...I&#x27;ve found my \\&quot;new\\&quot; signature scent : ) Not that anyone said anything either way while at work, but while working, I loved smelling the subtle hints of my new purchase. I will definitely be buying the bigger size. Hence, the only reason I bought body spray is because I was buying without smelling 1st. I did find myself using it about 2 or 3 times while at work. Maybe it&#x27;s because I didn&#x27;t use enough in the beginning, my body chemistry, diet etc. They say fragrance can alter with your chemistry, diet, stress situations etc. Overall, LOVE THIS and HIGHLY recommend.</li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t really like the smell of it and it leaks everywhere!!!</li>
            <li> This is another typical case of blind purchase gone bad. Such a horrible scent! It&#x27;s harsh, herbal, strong and really unpleasant.</li>
            <li> Smell doesn&#x27;t last long, but I like the scent. I had to transfer it to another bottle because I couldn&#x27;t spray it without it leaking all over my hands. I won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> Everything seemed fine until I started to spray myself and the bottle began to leak. Upon further investigation...the sprayer seemed broken b/c each time I sprayed the perfume on me...it would leak.</li>
            <li> This body mist is musky and subtle. I love it&#x27;s mysterious scent. I can&#x27;t wait to purchase more curve scents from liz they&#x27;re great</li>
            <li> Good product and GREAT PRICE...My daughters likes them smell and how it fits in the book bags with out taking up that much space..</li>
            <li> First smelled it on a coworker and tried it in this spray. It really is a way to smell beautiful without spending a fortune. The only problem is that when using it, the bottle seemed to leak so I just put it in another empty spray bottle after washig and drying it and finished enjoying it. I also love Curve Crush, Curve and Curve Kicks..and yes I would order it again!</li>
            <li> If you are into strong fragrances, I would suggest that you try this. The bottle does leak however every time I spray the fragrance.</li>
            <li> the smell was like a man smell and stronge the curve soul smells alot better gave it to my husban to wear and he needs to wear just alittle but the service was fast</li>
