            <li> Item was exactly as represented and as I expected it to be.</li>
            <li> item fit the base and works fine.  better than buying entire new toothbrush.</li>
            <li> HAS AN UNUSUAL SECOND SPEED ON THE BUTTON.  I CAN NOT TELL IF THAT IS A MALFUNCTION</li>
            <li> did not work or charge, I don&#x27;t know why so I am returning it and purchasing  a complete new set.</li>
            <li> My original handle was running out of juice and wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge for more than two days.  Bought this and took it on vacation.  Held a charge for three weeks.  Much cheaper than buying a whole new unit.</li>
            <li> More compact than my previous model; didn&#x27;t read carefully enough had to buy a new charging base but very pleased!</li>
            <li> Works better than the original handle I broke. It even came fully charged. If this performs for years as it has the first few weeks I&#x27;ve had it, it&#x27;s a great purchase on my part.</li>
            <li> Worked great and a lot cheaper than buying an entire new set.</li>
            <li> This product is a great way to replace a sonic care handle when the battery gets low. The initial lasted for about 5 years. This handle fit our sonic care series E toothbrushes perfectly.</li>
            <li> Wrong item sent!!! .... great product - just wrong handle</li>
            <li> It stopped holding a charge after 6 months.</li>
            <li> Wrong size for charger</li>
            <li> seems to be new, works fine</li>
            <li> Perfect, as advertised.</li>
            <li> Item is exactly as described - fit my e-series charger.  And it does have the quad-pacer timer.</li>
            <li> Handle has worked well to date (have used six times). Charged up correctly according to instructions. Compared to an earlier Sonicare Toothbrush, I previously owned, this battery produces a higher vibration action which massages the gums as well as cleans the teeth more effectively..</li>
            <li> So far this is the absolute best replacement handle I have had to date.  It holds a charge for long term use.  Far beyond other models of this type I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> Works great! I would recommend.</li>
            <li> THIS PHILLIPS REPLACEMENT HANDLE FOR MY SONICARE HANDLE, WHICH I USED FOR MANY YEARS, IS PERFECT. I WISH ONLY THAT AMAZON HAD INCLUDED MENTION OF WHICH CHARGER I WOULD NEED.</li>
            <li> Works great.  Saved a lot of money, not having to buy a whole new unit.  Better than my original in that it has 30-second indication.</li>
            <li> It  works.  Thank you.  All of my family and friends thank you.</li>
            <li> Bought toothbrush and charger separately and could not charge brush</li>
            <li> An affordable good replacement</li>
            <li> An inexpensive way to extend the life of the sonicare. Works just like new.</li>
            <li> Does what it needs to do.</li>
            <li> Has quad-spacer..works great</li>
            <li> good deal. works better than the one replaced.</li>
