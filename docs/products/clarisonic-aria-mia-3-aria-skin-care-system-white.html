            <li>Clarisonic did not honor the warranty because I could not find my original receipt.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is an awesome little device, well worth the investment.</li>
            <li>Although this is not a miracle worker in terms of reversing the clock (I think the only answer to that comes in a syringe or via some anesthesia and a very talented surgeon), it really improved the texture of my skin.  </li>

            <li>Pores get really clean without damaging your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aria</li>

            <li>Enjoy using the product makes your skin feel clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li>love it very much!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>There are too many knock offs out there now days that do just as good of a job as the Clarisonic for way less cost.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another benefit I&#x27;ve noticed is that my skin is more smooth and clean and my natural blush shows through</li>
            <li>The lightness of my skin and gentle yet deep cleaning qualities of the Aria is amazing!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m debating whether to purchase a second one and risk it since I liked the product so much.</li>
            <li>Makes my face clean and smooth looking daily</li>
            <li>When I tried the aria, my first thoughts were that my skin felt and looked just like it did after I had my dermavac.  </li>
            <li>I love what it did for my skin in that short time.</li>
            <li>Really, that is what she said!</li>
            <li>I have never seen a reduction in acne in either me or my teenagers and while my face feels clean after washing, it feels just as clean after using a different brand</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin and used properly this cleaned without irritation, once again love it.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend to buy it with is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>THe first time I used one, it felt so good, I pressed it way too hard against my face</li>
            <li>These are the &amp;#34;awesome problems I have my my facial skin:&lt;br /&gt;- fine lines and wrinkles on forehead and around eyes</li>
            <li>It definitely made a huge difference in how my makeup settle onto my skin.  </li>
            <li>My skin felt smooth and even, but it was around $300, and I just can&#x27;t justify that cost on a regular basis.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;+ Has a 1 or 2 minute timer, but I never use the timers so can&#x27;t say much about them</li>
            <li>ALthough, I don&#x27;t wear make up every day and I wash with a gentle exfoliating scrub at night.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t need as much make up when I do wear.</li>
            <li>Really noticed a difference in the size of my pores.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>Their warranty is only valid if you buy the product from a store they demean worthy of their greatness.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Until I received my first Clarsonic last Christmas, I thought that this was another gimmic, but I&#x27;ve been a believer since my first use.</li>
            <li>After using it for a week or so, I noticed a HUGE IMPROVEMENT - my greasy skin was less shiny / more balanced, my blackheads were gone, no new pimples were appearing!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>am a big fan of the clarisonic brushes, and have been using them since they first were made, 8 years ago!  </li>
            <li>My skin is perfect (used to look like 10 miles of bad road) and I bought a brush for my sister who then bought one for her husband.  </li>
            <li>My once rough skin is as smooth as it was when I was 10 -</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 33 years old, but I think my skin looks a bit older than my age.  </li>
            <li>Leaves the skin very soft without harshness.</li>
            <li>I fought back - I took many dermatologist visits &amp; treatments, tried several different prescription acne medications, tried washing my face 3 x</li>
            <li>I did not purchase white, I wanted red and should be able to have a red one that works!</li>
            <li>(ok so the wrinkles on my forehead are a little too deep to be called &amp;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 33 years old and have suffered from acne since age 13.</li>
            <li>I would recommend you buy directly from Clarisonic.</li>
            <li>ultrasonic, it vibrates back and forth really fast.</li>
            <li>The charging options also makes it easy to keep at home or travel with a small connector.</li>
            <li>(very handy, my Mia often ran out of power at inconvenient times)&lt;br</li>
            <li>The next thee were all purchased through Clarisonic and only one has not failed but it is under 90 days old</li>
            <li>/&gt;THe sensitive skin brush on the low setting is gentle enough for the neck and chest area as well.</li>
            <li>If you can&#x27;t afford an Aria, the Mia does a great job too at half the price (but with a few less perks).</li>
            <li>/&gt;+ Aria&#x27;s \\&quot;Sleek new design\\&quot; is almost identical to the other models, but it is shinier</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Don&#x27;t even think about getting any other color because they only replace with the white that will yellow within 6 months</li>
            <li> br /&gt;-dull, dry skin (especially in winter)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The first Aria they sent me was an out of box failure.  </li>
            <li> but the solution is simple - Use a different cleanser once daily, and use the Clarisonic for slightly less time than usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> use the Clarisonic Aria 2 x daily, usually with Neutrogena Clear Pore Acne Mask.</li>
            <li> The end result is the same and they feel the same when you use them, but the Aria has a few extra  perks:&lt;br /&gt;+</li>
            <li> The real issue is Clarisonic customer service and their failure to honor the warranty.  </li>
            <li> I purchased two original devices that were over $200 each about 6 months apart and each failed within 18 months.</li>
            <li> and I was told that I can&#x27;t expect them to replace all of them that fail with the original color purchased.</li>
            <li> , bought and tried almost every single over-the-counter acne product and NOTHING</li>
            <li> I have only one Aria that has ever been replaced by Clarisonic and that was the black one.  </li>
            <li> few months ago, I received a Clarisonic Aria as a birthday present.</li>
            <li> while the &amp;#34;vac&amp;#34; sucked away the dead skin cells...sounds gross, I know.  </li>
            <li> but Clarisonic does not really honor the warranty.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone for two weeks without using it and after about 9 days my face starts to feel rough again.</li>
            <li> I told them I wanted a other aria, so they emailed me a prepaid label, and as soon as it was in the UPS system, they sent me another, which is working perfectly!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and you use less product.</li>
            <li> It failed at 49 days and they would not replace the red unless I would accept white.</li>
            <li> I bought this a little over three weeks ago.</li>
            <li> Battery life is a little longer</li>
            <li> WHile cleaning my pores, it also polishes off all the dead skin.</li>
            <li> The next one was a Mia that failed in 60 days and again Clarisonic did not replace because it was purchased through an &amp;#34;unauthorized&amp;#34; seller on Amazon.</li>
            <li> daily (maybe it&#x27;s too dirty?)</li>
            <li> I also have Dermatillomania, which makes having acne into a huge issue - I have seriously damaged my skin and made my breakouts worse, and fell into a horrible breakout cycle that never ends!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I contacted them Amazon.com was too far below their snobbery and the warranty was a worthless piece of paper.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately retailers selling this item on Amazon.com are not authorized sellers.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it stopped working</li>
            <li> This is my 6th Clarisonic device and all but one of them have failed before the warranties have run out</li>
            <li> (yes I know that was stupid)</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed when it stopped working.</li>

            <li> Easy to use and gives very good results on first use. The charging options also makes it easy to keep at home or travel with a small connector.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 33 years old and have suffered from acne since age 13. I didn&#x27;t just sit there and stare at my pimples, either. I fought back - I took many dermatologist visits &amp; treatments, tried several different prescription acne medications, tried washing my face 3 x daily (maybe it&#x27;s too dirty?) then not at all (maybe I should leave it alone?), bought and tried almost every single over-the-counter acne product and NOTHING WORKED. I also have Dermatillomania, which makes having acne into a huge issue - I have seriously damaged my skin and made my breakouts worse, and fell into a horrible breakout cycle that never ends!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few months ago, I received a Clarisonic Aria as a birthday present. After using it for a week or so, I noticed a HUGE IMPROVEMENT - my greasy skin was less shiny / more balanced, my blackheads were gone, no new pimples were appearing! I couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes! Was my acne finally going away? The answer is YES!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the Clarisonic Aria 2 x daily, usually with Neutrogena Clear Pore Acne Mask. It can sometimes be over-drying (especially in the winter) but the solution is simple - Use a different cleanser once daily, and use the Clarisonic for slightly less time than usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so glad I found this product. It has truly changed my life. A Clarisonic is a MUST for all acne sufferers!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 33 years old, but I think my skin looks a bit older than my age.  These are the &amp;#34;awesome problems I have my my facial skin:&lt;br /&gt;- fine lines and wrinkles on forehead and around eyes (ok so the wrinkles on my forehead are a little too deep to be called &amp;#34;fine&amp;#34;)&lt;br /&gt;-large pored around nasal area&lt;br /&gt;-miniscule blackheads or clogged pores on nasal area and chin&lt;br /&gt;-dull, dry skin (especially in winter)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I once had this facial done with a dermavac, basically it was an exfoliation while the &amp;#34;vac&amp;#34; sucked away the dead skin cells...sounds gross, I know.  My skin felt smooth and even, but it was around $300, and I just can&#x27;t justify that cost on a regular basis.  When I tried the aria, my first thoughts were that my skin felt and looked just like it did after I had my dermavac.  Although this is not a miracle worker in terms of reversing the clock (I think the only answer to that comes in a syringe or via some anesthesia and a very talented surgeon), it really improved the texture of my skin.  For me, better texture means that my skin looks better with my makeup on.  It definitely made a huge difference in how my makeup settle onto my skin.  I also noticed that there was a big improvement not only with my the cleansing of my clogged pores, my also in minimizing my pores (note, that I used the deep pore cleansing brush and cleanser gel).  I&#x27;m that &amp;#34;that girl&amp;#34; who has tried a lot skin products, and this is definitely a winner in my eyes.  I would rate in my top 5 of about 100 skin products I have tested over the years!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately retailers selling this item on Amazon.com are not authorized sellers. I ordered this item for my wife for Christmas. She loved it for the 90 days it worked. Unfortunately it stopped working and we found that the warranty would not be honored because it was not purchased through an authorized retailer. We wanted a refund from Amazon. They would not provide one, but did provide a credit. I would recommend you buy directly from Clarisonic. I costs the same,has free shipping and if it breaks they will honor the warranty.</li>
            <li> This product is great for your skin. It exfoliates making your products go on smoothly and you use less product. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Gave this as a gift to one of my daughters and she still raves about how wonderful it is. &amp;#34;I only use it 2-3 days a week, but my skin looks great.&amp;#34; That&#x27;s a pretty good recommendation!</li>
            <li> This is a magic unit. I us it with the gel cleaner and love it. I have received comments on my skin about the glow that it now has. I would highly recommend to buy it with is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> This company is amazing!  The first Aria they sent me was an out of box failure.  They asked me what I wanted to do.  I told them I wanted a other aria, so they emailed me a prepaid label, and as soon as it was in the UPS system, they sent me another, which is working perfectly!&lt;br /&gt;I am a big fan of the clarisonic brushes, and have been using them since they first were made, 8 years ago!  My skin is perfect (used to look like 10 miles of bad road) and I bought a brush for my sister who then bought one for her husband.  It&#x27;s just the best product for healthy, glowing, blemish-free skin.</li>
            <li> I gave these to m daughters and grand daughters for Christmas because I use one and love the results.  They were very happy to receive the as well.</li>
            <li> Enjoy using the product makes your skin feel clean and fresh.  Hopefully it will help in my skin health.  Very easy to use&lt;br /&gt;and the cleansing products are good.</li>
            <li> A prefect handsome product! It&#x27;s so useful!&lt;br /&gt;I love it very much!&lt;br /&gt;I will buy it for my family and friends!</li>
            <li> Makes my face clean and smooth looking daily</li>
            <li> My roomate is the one who ordered and uses it, and seems to love it.  Leaves the skin very soft without harshness.</li>
            <li> I hesitated over the price but am SO glad I took the plunge.  Worth every penny!  My face has never felt so clean.</li>
            <li> I bought this a little over three weeks ago. I love what it did for my skin in that short time. I was very disappointed when it stopped working. I&#x27;m debating whether to purchase a second one and risk it since I liked the product so much.</li>
            <li> Great product but beware of warranty scam by manufacture. Their warranty is only valid if you buy the product from a store they demean worthy of their greatness. When I contacted them Amazon.com was too far below their snobbery and the warranty was a worthless piece of paper.</li>
            <li> This is my 6th Clarisonic device and all but one of them have failed before the warranties have run out but Clarisonic does not really honor the warranty. I purchased two original devices that were over $200 each about 6 months apart and each failed within 18 months. Clarisonic did not honor the warranty because I could not find my original receipt. The next one was a Mia that failed in 60 days and again Clarisonic did not replace because it was purchased through an &amp;#34;unauthorized&amp;#34; seller on Amazon. The next thee were all purchased through Clarisonic and only one has not failed but it is under 90 days old so we will see.  The real issue is Clarisonic customer service and their failure to honor the warranty.  I have only one Aria that has ever been replaced by Clarisonic and that was the black one.  Don&#x27;t even think about getting any other color because they only replace with the white that will yellow within 6 months and I was told that I can&#x27;t expect them to replace all of them that fail with the original color purchased. Really, that is what she said! I specifically ordered a red one because I had remodeled my bathroom and paid extra to get that color. It failed at 49 days and they would not replace the red unless I would accept white. I did not purchase white, I wanted red and should be able to have a red one that works! So all in all, over the last four years, I have spent nearly $1150 to have only one working Clarisonic. There are too many knock offs out there now days that do just as good of a job as the Clarisonic for way less cost. I have never seen a reduction in acne in either me or my teenagers and while my face feels clean after washing, it feels just as clean after using a different brand so the moral is....Don&#x27;t purchase a Clarisonic unless you like to throw your money away.</li>
            <li> I have never enjoyed washing my face this much ! The lightness of my skin and gentle yet deep cleaning qualities of the Aria is amazing!</li>
            <li> How it works:&lt;br /&gt;Truly ultrasonic, it vibrates back and forth really fast. Pores get really clean without damaging your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aria vs Mia&lt;br /&gt;I have a Mia and an Aria. The end result is the same and they feel the same when you use them, but the Aria has a few extra  perks:&lt;br /&gt;+ Battery indicator light (very handy, my Mia often ran out of power at inconvenient times)&lt;br /&gt;+ Battery life is a little longer&lt;br /&gt;+ USB charger (also has a wall adapter for it if you don&#x27;t have one)&lt;br /&gt;+ Three speeds&lt;br /&gt;+ Aria&#x27;s \\&quot;Sleek new design\\&quot; is almost identical to the other models, but it is shinier&lt;br /&gt;+ Comes with a stand&lt;br /&gt;+ Has a 1 or 2 minute timer, but I never use the timers so can&#x27;t say much about them&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until I received my first Clarsonic last Christmas, I thought that this was another gimmic, but I&#x27;ve been a believer since my first use. My once rough skin is as smooth as it was when I was 10 - and it&#x27;s acne free! WHile cleaning my pores, it also polishes off all the dead skin. A sample of cleaning gel comes with the kit, but when you run out any gel will do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apparently you can use this twice a day, but I don&#x27;t see why anyone would do that. I use mine once a week and that keeps my face clean and glowing all week. I&#x27;ve gone for two weeks without using it and after about 9 days my face starts to feel rough again. ALthough, I don&#x27;t wear make up every day and I wash with a gentle exfoliating scrub at night. Also, to make life a litle easier on my skin, I wash any make up off my face before using the Clarsonic as per their instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another benefit I&#x27;ve noticed is that my skin is more smooth and clean and my natural blush shows through so I don&#x27;t need as much make up when I do wear. Also&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THe sensitive skin brush on the low setting is gentle enough for the neck and chest area as well. One thing to remember is that you are not brushing your teeth, if you push the CLarsonic against your skin, it will result in something similar to a sunburn. THe first time I used one, it felt so good, I pressed it way too hard against my face (yes I know that was stupid) and it felt like sunburn. I get great results just letting i gently glide across my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an awesome little device, well worth the investment. If you can&#x27;t afford an Aria, the Mia does a great job too at half the price (but with a few less perks).</li>
            <li> Really noticed a difference in the size of my pores.&lt;br /&gt;Love it! Will travel to Europe with it as well.</li>
            <li> I love my Aria! I have super sensitive skin and used properly this cleaned without irritation, once again love it.</li>
            <li> My face has never felt cleaner! Great product!! I use it for my neck too and Clarisonic&#x27;s face cleaner is really nice as well.</li>
