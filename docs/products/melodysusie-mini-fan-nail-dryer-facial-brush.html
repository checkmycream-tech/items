            <li>good value!!</li>
            <li>It works great</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin feeling amazing!</li>
            <li>and I love it, but my experience wasn&#x27;t the best.  </li>
            <li>I eat well and have a good skin care regimen, but couldn&#x27;t keep the breakouts from stopping.</li>
            <li>Bottom line, this brush is great, but MelodySusie needs to provide better service for their customers.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>After reading about this product, I decided to try it on my own.</li>
            <li>but this does a nice job exfoliating and my face has a nice glow after using it.</li>
            <li>and now I can :)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>love the MelodySusie  </li>
            <li>Love the size, strength, and softness</li>
            <li>Until then, I&#x27;m a truly satisfied customer...</li>
            <li>I chose to go to the company and see if I could get a new cord since the brush itself worked great.</li>
            <li>My have feels so clean after using it!</li>
            <li>and I felt pretty comfortable and kind of interesting when it was vibrating on my face.</li>
            <li>I purchased this when it was on sale, it works just fine.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>I turn this on to the highest vibration (you can use lower settings if you prefer) and just move the brush in circular motions, and afterwards my face feels perfectly clean and smooth.</li>
            <li>It came very fast and was well-packaged in a transparent cute box.</li>
            <li>The silicone is soft but effective, and it&#x27;s easy to keep it clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really glad I didn&#x27;t pay much for it.</li>
            <li>I have been used a 5-in-1 facial brush for over one year and the whole accessories have been a great job on my face</li>
            <li>This little handy device stops acne in its tracks and has even helped acne scars disappear more quickly.</li>
            <li>I love that I can use it in and out of the shower, and the silicon material of this brush allows me to easily disinfect it with some simple Dial antibacterial soap.</li>
            <li>I just press it gently against my face and circle around, and my skin feels so smooth after I rinse everything out.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I would like to give the actual brush 5 stars.</li>
            <li>I really have to say this little cleansing brush is pretty great.  </li>
            <li>I decided not to &#x27;splurge&#x27; on my next go-round with a face cleanser, and this little gadget COMPLETELY fit the bill!!!!</li>
            <li>I most definitely will buy another one when/if this MelodySusie Sonic Face Brush ever decides to check out....</li>
            <li>I used to use the spinning facial brushes, but I find that I like this one much better.</li>
            <li>I suppose the actually makes this device better but quite frankly don&#x27;t think makes much difference.</li>
            <li>I sanitized and gently pushed through a handful of stubborn whiteheads on the first try.</li>
            <li>total plus for being easy on the pocketbook, too)</li>
            <li>This facial cleansing brush works fine.</li>
            <li>I used the side with tiny silicon granules to clean my face with cleanser the first night I received it</li>
            <li>It works much better than what I expected.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really have problem skin</li>
            <li>I use it at night when I have been wearing makeup for the whole day.</li>
            <li>It is much cheaper than FOREO</li>
            <li>When you invest $300+ on a very renowned brand, you hope to have faith in it...</li>
            <li>My face feels so much cleaner and youthful.</li>
            <li>I was not 100% sure whether it was definitely cleaning my skin, but when I washed my face, I felt my skin very relaxing and baby soft.</li>
            <li>but I really tried with the other side of the brush as I think it would let my skin absorb the emulsion deep into the skin much better.</li>
            <li>Oil pulling, exfoliants, new serums, charcoal masks, etc.</li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t think this little cleansing brush was going to do much, considering it was small, and fit comfortably in the palm of my hand.</li>
            <li>The product is just okay, I was missing the wow factor.</li>
            <li>wow!</li>
            <li>My skin has completely changed!</li>
            <li>Very convenient and effecient facial brush!</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and have redness on my cheeks.</li>
            <li>This thing brought them all up the surface with no trouble at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had been using a sonic face brush spin-off until I felt like it was making my skin too sensitive.</li>
            <li>I finally decided to contact Amazon and just replace the whole product, which they did without any problems.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think the sonic facial did much for my skin.  </li>
            <li>The first time I noticed this silicon facial cleaning brush on Amazon, I didn&#x27;t think it would really clean my skin, as I was not sure about the vibrating design making sense.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 25 and until the past year, I have always had good skin with a few breakouts here and there.</li>
            <li>The only thing I am worrying about right now is how long this product can last.</li>

            <li> I was worried that it wouldn&#x27;t work for very long.</li>
            <li> I wanted to leave a review only after i had a chance to use the facial brush a few</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think this piece would really worth reviewing (I got it during the infamous Prime Day fiasco for about $10 off its regular $35 price...</li>
            <li> but I still hope it can last long before breaking down.</li>
            <li> That said there are similar devices now for less than $20 so still somewhat overpriced.</li>
            <li> I stopped using the sonic facial after a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> After reading the reviews from other customers, I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if everyone will have the same fortune as I did,</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, but</li>
            <li> I also didn&#x27;t have much faith in something where the actual bristles themselves didn&#x27;t move, but after turning this on and giving it a go, I am no longer skeptical!</li>
            <li> I got this little guy in the mail two days ago and used it twice a day since then.</li>
            <li> few years ago I had bought a sonic care and within a year it wasnt holding the charge anymore</li>
            <li> few times I wanted to through this thing out the window</li>
            <li> I have had this for a few weeks</li>
            <li> But this device 3x less expensive and that makes a BIG difference.</li>
            <li> It came with very little  on how to use it</li>
            <li> My stress in the past year has increased though and so has my acne</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it let me down.</li>
            <li> LOVELOVELOVE this little gem!!!</li>
            <li> I had invested into the big face/body Clairsonic Brush, and I was extremely disappointed of its two year shelf-life...</li>
            <li> I tried everything to get rid of these irritating bumps.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> After reading about this product, I decided to try it on my own. The product is just okay, I was missing the wow factor.</li>
            <li> This product do not provide the &amp;#34;Sonic&amp;#34; cleaning experience it just vibrates. My wife did not used it after 3 times.</li>
            <li> I have been used a 5-in-1 facial brush for over one year and the whole accessories have been a great job on my face but I just got tired of changing head to head to clean my skin. The first time I noticed this silicon facial cleaning brush on Amazon, I didn&#x27;t think it would really clean my skin, as I was not sure about the vibrating design making sense. After reading the reviews from other customers, I decided to give it a try. It came very fast and was well-packaged in a transparent cute box. I used the side with tiny silicon granules to clean my face with cleanser the first night I received it and I felt pretty comfortable and kind of interesting when it was vibrating on my face. I was not 100% sure whether it was definitely cleaning my skin, but when I washed my face, I felt my skin very relaxing and baby soft. It does not mention that it can be used with emulsion but I really tried with the other side of the brush as I think it would let my skin absorb the emulsion deep into the skin much better. I also tried it with different mode of vibration and the power can last for a very long time after being fully recharged. Very convenient and effecient facial brush! It works much better than what I expected. I think it should be advertised as silicon facial cleansing and massaging brush! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This is very similar to the Forneo Luna Mini - only difference is the &amp;#34;ergonomic&amp;#34; shape and the price. I suppose the actually makes this device better but quite frankly don&#x27;t think makes much difference. But this device 3x less expensive and that makes a BIG difference. That said there are similar devices now for less than $20 so still somewhat overpriced. I don&#x27;t really have problem skin but this does a nice job exfoliating and my face has a nice glow after using it. Still don&#x27;t see myself using this on a daily basis which is why couldn&#x27;t justify more expensive devices.</li>
            <li> I wanted to leave a review only after i had a chance to use the facial brush a few time.&lt;br /&gt;A few years ago I had bought a sonic care and within a year it wasnt holding the charge anymore so I&lt;br /&gt;Had to keep it plugged in at all times.&lt;br /&gt;A few times I wanted to through this thing out the window and now I can :)&lt;br /&gt;I love the MelodySusie  its small, it works as well as the sonic care and the best of all no more expensive brushes to replace.</li>
            <li> My have feels so clean after using it!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and have redness on my cheeks. I like this product because it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. I use it at night when I have been wearing makeup for the whole day. I just press it gently against my face and circle around, and my skin feels so smooth after I rinse everything out. The only thing I am worrying about right now is how long this product can last. It is much cheaper than FOREO but I still hope it can last long before breaking down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in the beauty business and have seen, used and passed on a lot of products over the years.  I really have to say this little cleansing brush is pretty great.  I have now bought five as gifts!  Rick Lesser www.ricklesser.com</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think this piece would really worth reviewing (I got it during the infamous Prime Day fiasco for about $10 off its regular $35 price...what can I say, I had low hopes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve suffered with tiny bumpy whiteheads on my cheeks the last six months. I tried everything to get rid of these irritating bumps. Oil pulling, exfoliants, new serums, charcoal masks, etc. Nothing helped. I got this little guy in the mail two days ago and used it twice a day since then. By last night (third use), it exfoliated my skin down to a baby softness I hadn&#x27;t felt in years. PLUS, it managed to bring all the gunk to the surface. I sanitized and gently pushed through a handful of stubborn whiteheads on the first try. This thing brought them all up the surface with no trouble at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if everyone will have the same fortune as I did, but I suggest trying. It leaves your skin feeling amazing!</li>
            <li> I had been using a sonic face brush spin-off until I felt like it was making my skin too sensitive. I saw the melody Susie during Amazon&#x27;s deal day and thought to try it. This actually does seem Rui cleanse my skin well and without the somewhat abrasive feeling of the other brush</li>
            <li> LOVELOVELOVE this little gem!!! I had invested into the big face/body Clairsonic Brush, and I was extremely disappointed of its two year shelf-life... When you invest $300+ on a very renowned brand, you hope to have faith in it... Unfortunately, it let me down. I decided not to &#x27;splurge&#x27; on my next go-round with a face cleanser, and this little gadget COMPLETELY fit the bill!!!! Love the size, strength, and softness it provides for my 41 year-old face.... I most definitely will buy another one when/if this MelodySusie Sonic Face Brush ever decides to check out.... Until then, I&#x27;m a truly satisfied customer...(a total plus for being easy on the pocketbook, too)</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t think this little cleansing brush was going to do much, considering it was small, and fit comfortably in the palm of my hand. I also didn&#x27;t have much faith in something where the actual bristles themselves didn&#x27;t move, but after turning this on and giving it a go, I am no longer skeptical! I turn this on to the highest vibration (you can use lower settings if you prefer) and just move the brush in circular motions, and afterwards my face feels perfectly clean and smooth. I love that I can use it in and out of the shower, and the silicon material of this brush allows me to easily disinfect it with some simple Dial antibacterial soap. If you are shopping for a simple and inexpensive cleansing brush similar to the Luna, I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I like the way this feels on my face.</li>
            <li> This facial cleansing brush works fine. It came with very little  on how to use it otherwise I would have given it five stars.</li>
            <li> good value!! you can not beat the price,same quality with the hundred brand</li>
            <li> I cannot rave enough about this!!!! I was skeptical at first, but wow! My skin has completely changed! I&#x27;m 25 and until the past year, I have always had good skin with a few breakouts here and there. My stress in the past year has increased though and so has my acne.. I eat well and have a good skin care regimen, but couldn&#x27;t keep the breakouts from stopping. This little handy device stops acne in its tracks and has even helped acne scars disappear more quickly. My face feels so much cleaner and youthful. I use it once/twice a day and I just purchased another one for my boyfriend to try. Another note -The battery lasts forever.. I went around 2 months without charging it until I finally had to recharge it again!</li>
            <li> I used to use the spinning facial brushes, but I find that I like this one much better. The silicone is soft but effective, and it&#x27;s easy to keep it clean.</li>
            <li> I have had this for a few weeks and I&#x27;ve used it off and on.  I have noticed that the days I use it (with a Weleda cream cleanser), the red spots, zits, and dryness all even out.  it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I would like to give the actual brush 5 stars. It works great and I love it, but my experience wasn&#x27;t the best.  I ordered this product here and received it no problem. However, I noticed that the charging cord it comes with did not work. I chose to go to the company and see if I could get a new cord since the brush itself worked great. There is no phone number on their website, just an email that promises to reply within 24 hours. A few days later, they finally respond and promise to send me a new cord within 7-10 days. That never happened. I finally decided to contact Amazon and just replace the whole product, which they did without any problems.  Bottom line, this brush is great, but MelodySusie needs to provide better service for their customers.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think the sonic facial did much for my skin.  I actually prefer using a konjac sponge instead.  I stopped using the sonic facial after a few weeks.  I&#x27;m really glad I didn&#x27;t pay much for it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this when it was on sale, it works just fine. I was worried that it wouldn&#x27;t work for very long. So far so good. I purchased this because I didn&#x27;t want to pay for the Foreo.</li>
