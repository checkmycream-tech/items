    <ol>
            <li> Very moisturizing. Leaves my hair soft and smooth. I use it in conjunction with Keracare Shampoo. Highly recommend the whole Keracare line of products.</li>
            <li> Wonderful on my newly natural hair leaves my hair soft and manageable i sit inder hood dryer 15-20min then rinse out love this product</li>
            <li> Good conditioner. Leaves me hair feeling very soft and looks good. Deff recommend these too all my friends. My hair dresser recommended this</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Love the way it makes feel.</li>
            <li> This is the best hair product, the shampoo is great too. It makes your hair feel silky and also takes dangles out.</li>
            <li> I used Keracare&#x27;s Humecto many years ago and in all honesty I stopped using Humecto because of its cost.  About 3 years ago I let go of relaxing my below shoulder length hair and let it go natural.  Between being natural and now having semi-permanent color in my hair it tends to get dry.  When evaluating conditioners to correct my imbalances and keep moisture locked into my hair I started using the Humecto again. My hair absolutely loves this product!  It definitely hydrates and humectifies.  I use it every two weeks to deep condition my hair and apply the Humecto (sometimes I add a few drops of either Keracare&#x27;s Essential Oil, Jojoba Oil, or Mizani&#x27;s Supreme Oil), place a plastic cap on my head and sit under the heat cap for about 20 minutes.  Rinse, style and then I feel that wonderful moisture and softness locked into my hair. I spritz with the Keracare Silken Seal Liquid Sheen and I&#x27;m good. The cost of Humectois now worth it to me to achieve the the end result of healthy, hydrated, soft, shiny hair.  Although I&#x27;ve never tried any of the shampoos in the Keracare product line, I recently bought their Moisturizing Shampoo for Color Treated Hair which I will soon try to further enhance keeping moisture in my hair.</li>
            <li> This conditioner leaves my hair so soft and manageable.  It also moisturizes my hair and smells so good.  I have been looking for a good conditioner for a long time and I&#x27;ve finally found it.</li>
            <li> I love the products and really work for my hair.  I brag about this product. is amazing! Wow! great buy</li>
            <li> I have never used it but my daughter who is leaving for college lives by it. I use and have used Keracare products and never been disappointed</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several years and it makes my hair super soft and healthy.  It also adds sheen and detangles. I use as a normal conditioner or a deep conditioner.</li>
            <li> My stylist in New York started me on this product and I love it.  I now have little to no shedding and the smell and feel of my hair is fantastic.  Definitely worth trying.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Amazom offers the best price.  Highly recommend the this product for natural hair.</li>
            <li> By far the best conditioner my mixed race daughter has ever used.</li>
            <li> I bought this product, along with others, because I am currently using Avlon Affirm when perming (which is the parent of the Keracare line). This conditioner is okay, but considering that it doesn&#x27;t work wonders, I would suggest buying something cheaper. Miss Jessie&#x27;s Creme de la Curl works wonders for me! I am relaxed.</li>
            <li> Great Product, great price</li>
            <li> I have a love/hate relationship with humecto. Sometimes it leaves my hair feeling great, gives me tons of slip and moisture/softness. At other times I find it just melts into my hair but seems to do nothing.. Almost too watery. Then I have to reach for another thicker conditioner. One thing about humecto is that it smells great, and when my hair decides to allow it it gives amazing results. It will always be in my stash of products as a result.</li>
            <li> Best stuff I ever put in my hair. No words to describe this, been using it for 5 years now and can&#x27;t go one wash without it.</li>
            <li> This product is great.  My hairstylist turned me on to it and I can tell the difference ; my hair is no longer dry and brittle.  Recommend this product for anyone who has dry hair.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It is really good, it softens your hair in a few minutes but you do need to leave in on longer.  And it smells good.</li>
            <li> Been using this item for a while. Great price.</li>
            <li> There is no other conditioner like this. I color my hair and I never have a problem with breakage or tangling. I love this stuff!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product and my hair has improved so much with more body and shine and I would recommend it to everyone. I have fine hair and this is just what I have been looking for.</li>
            <li> Love this product .. Las it&#x27;s avbl online..</li>
            <li> This product is great for dry, brittle and lifeless hair. My former beautician recommended this and I have been hooked since. I continue to purchase Humecto cream conditioner for my hair as coloring and perming it dries my hair constantly. This product has brought my hair back to life.</li>
            <li> Makes my relaxed hair feel very soft... I&#x27;ve been using this as my staple for a couple of years now.</li>
