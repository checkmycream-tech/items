    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>There is no cakey or lumpy feeling, the lotion adapts perfectly to your skins chemistry.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a wonderful kit.</li>
            <li>This set is excellent.</li>
            <li>But otherwise it is great</li>
            <li>A great way to moisturize without any oily residue.</li>
            <li>It has a very delicious rose scent.</li>
            <li>I experienced no irritation or redness with this kit at all.</li>
            <li>also-marketing did a great job there.</li>
            <li>but it did a great job softening and giving her a nice glow-which makes me happy to see her</li>
            <li>The cream does have a pronounced floral scent that I don&#x27;t mind since I now use it at night, and the serum smells like pleasant astringent.  </li>
            <li>Both products feel good on my skin, have a pleasant flower like scent and caused no blemishes or over drying.  </li>
            <li>I took that as a good start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still getting good results.</li>
            <li>Still, the results are good, and that&#x27;s what counts.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The face wash smells good</li>
            <li>, I save it for special occasions that I need to look especially nice for.  </li>
            <li>That said this kit contains a pleasant and effective moisturizer plus a &amp;#34;serum&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I love that!  </li>
            <li>The scent of roses is nice as well.</li>
            <li>My skin does seem nicely moisturized, and somewhat firmer since using these products.</li>
            <li>These products will make your skin feel good and probably look a bit better</li>
            <li>It has a nice scent.</li>
            <li>This is a nice face wash and cream.</li>
            <li>so I like the rose scent of this product.</li>
            <li>The product itself smelled great after application and stuck around for several hours afterward which was real nice.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to use.</li>
            <li>The rose scent is a bit strong as it was immediately detectable when I opened the plastic on the box.</li>
            <li>Not too strong, just a hint of rose.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve had a very hot summer and the natural ingredients feel great on my skin and the hydration looks and feels great throughout the day.</li>
            <li>I do love Phyto skin care products.  </li>
            <li>three weeks later...I do love the feel of this product - hydrating without being greasy.  </li>
            <li>I do love the feel of this product - hydrating without being greasy.  </li>
            <li>These are a serum and a cream to use every day for better skin.</li>
            <li>My face is tighter and my pores are more refined.  </li>
            <li>Most of the products I use to fight aging (for example Lancome&#x27;s Genrifique)</li>
            <li>and I like it better than the chemically laden versions.</li>
            <li>For the price, I would expect it to be more than just a moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>The product comes in an elegant box with two pump bottles, and a pamphlet.  </li>
            <li>but they are not the miraculous fountain of youth so many seek.</li>
            <li>Often hands can give your age away better than the face can.</li>
            <li>Continued use equals more results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this is a wonderful product, but I have super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I will continue monitoring the results for improved skin tone, since I am happy with this system so far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m quickly becoming a fan of the Ageless La Cure line of Beauty/Cleansing Products.  </li>
            <li>When using you will notice a distinct rose scent that others can detect.</li>
            <li>The serum goes on easily, and then cream kit does as well.</li>
            <li>Back to THIS beautiful</li>
            <li>The night serum has helped diminish the look of pours and fine lines.</li>
            <li>I will say that I do love the rose fragrance and my skin feels very smooth and soft after about 2 weeks worth of use.</li>
            <li>after lightly washing my skin, I shake the serum bottle and give two pumps of product to my fingertips.  </li>
            <li>Give two pumps of the cream - lightly massage into my face/neck.  </li>
            <li>I received this product for free in exchange for an unbiased review.  </li>
            <li>It also advertises a toner and a cleanser to go along with the creams, which I did not get, so i used my own reasonably priced cleansers, and felt they worked well with it.</li>
            <li>This kit when used as directed will give you skin a smooth and glowing appearance and feel.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m noticing some wrinkles diminishing in size, and my face looks more fresh.</li>
            <li>I tend to use the serum by day and both at night for a smooth, supple skin texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed after a week of use that the serum kind of plumps up skin and makes it feel very hydrated.</li>
            <li>It has a light clean scent without being overpowering.</li>
            <li>Original review:  </li>
            <li>While it does dissipate quickly, I prefer a light citrus or ginger type of scent...</li>
            <li>I followed the directions explicitly but it doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything special.</li>
            <li>With the cost for this as high as it is, I have high expectations on the results to be delivered, but so far I am very impressed.</li>
            <li>Rose is actually very good for sensitive skin, which seems odd to me as the fragance can be pretty strong.</li>
            <li>They claim the cream and serum are organic, local sourced, fair trade, Eco-friendly, and &amp;#34;bio-certified&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>My face has a bit of a glow that I have only seen after using a Glamglow mask, so that is another good sign.</li>
            <li>I guess I have used the product amount wisely as its week 3, and I still have some left.  </li>
            <li>The kit itself is super stylish and modern looking-loved the bottle design</li>
            <li>Otherwise, when this product is gone, I will return to using my more economical current favorite &amp;#34;anti-aging&amp;#34; moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I love this package so far.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this set, really.</li>
            <li>My skin does feel fresh and look brighter using the serum and cream together.</li>
            <li>love that Ageless La Cure uses natural products to produce their products.  </li>
            <li>I use rose hip oil as a daily moisturizer</li>
            <li>Yes, the packaging conveys clean and pure, but since those parts are discarded...</li>
            <li>but as it sits right now I probable would not use this product again after what I have is gone.</li>
            <li>I judge my skin looking younger as worth me continuously buying more.</li>
            <li>I like the serum very much.</li>
            <li>All natural ingredients make it a joy to use with absolutely no greasy feel, no irritation, no lingering scent and no oily sheen!</li>
            <li>after rinsing face, two pumps of just the cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with how delicately and smooth it spreads and soaks into my skin.  </li>
            <li>After the 3 weeks of using this system, I definitely think this system noticeably changed my skin for the better.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time I have bought an organic face lotion</li>
            <li>I used photos to try to limit the placebo effect and make the comparison more objective.  </li>
            <li>With this serum and moisturizing cream set, my skin gets an especially noticeably elegant and refined beauty to it.  </li>
            <li>I noticed a change after the first night.</li>
            <li>reaction may not be typical, so it&#x27;s worth trying on your own.</li>
            <li>The ingredients in their products are very gentle on the skin and from pure sources (not as synthetic as most commercial brands).  </li>
            <li>First, the texture of the serum and the moisturizer is very nice and emollient without being overly thick.</li>
            <li>On larger wrinkles or laugh lines I&#x27;ve noticed just a hint of softening and fine lines are still there too.</li>
            <li>Both products are fine tuned so they can be used by those with sensitive skin, and It is apparent that the ingredients in their products are very gentle, and from natural sources, not synthetics, as most cosmetic brands.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d much rather have a bit more product since this is pricey (currently offered on Amazon at $168).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For night time...</li>
            <li>However, after even one week of use, I&#x27;m seeing positive results.</li>
            <li>The kit comes with  very impressive, specific instructions which is a big plus  as that was  not included in some other pricey skin care treatments I have tried.  </li>
            <li>I love the way this cream feels on my dry skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After Week 3:  still going strong with my younger looking face.  </li>
            <li>High praise for this!  </li>
            <li>Left my face feeling comfortable throughout the day (and night after p.m. application).  </li>
            <li>Left my face feeling comfortable throughout the day (and night after p.m. application).  </li>
            <li>One thing to note tho...don&#x27;t put it on and then go straight to bed</li>
            <li>#34;fill wrinkles from the inside&amp;#34; and to &amp;#34;provide restoration, protection and much needed hydration.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>I really do like this serum and cream.</li>
            <li>but this product was not irritating at all.</li>
            <li>Their Phyto 5 formula seems to work really well on my ultra-sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>and I like it so much</li>
            <li>That is one thing that really impresses me about this cream and serum, the fact that they give me a refined look.  </li>
            <li>but I really don&#x27;t like the smell of the lotion at all.</li>
            <li>I really do like this product and have used it morning and night as directed.</li>
            <li>Many other products I have tried don&#x27;t really seem to do much.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t love it the way I do some of the manufacturer&#x27;s other products.  </li>
            <li>The ingredients are safe for sensitive skin and really soothe dry skin and moisturizes very well.</li>
            <li>The Les 5 Secrets cream with acacia gum, cupuacu butter, shea butter and precious essential oils of rose and squalane hydrate, firm and restructure, achieving radiant and younger looking skin.</li>
            <li>If it wasn&#x27;t so pricey, I would continue with it for all the positives I do notice.r, shea butter and precious essential oils of rose and squalane hydrate, firm and restructure, achieving radiant and younger looking skin.</li>
            <li>only downside for me (other than the high price) is I am not a big fan of rose scent - and these definitely have a rose scent.  </li>
            <li>The main thing I&#x27;m leery of is the price.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t know what they are without looking them up, but the main list is one</li>
            <li>Right now, I am using it very sparingly to make it last.</li>
            <li>The Les 5 Secrets Serum with commiphora extract, traditionally used in Ayurveda medicine, smoothens wrinkles and gently mixes with natural essential oils of rose and apricot to provide major hydration and anti-aging treatment.</li>
            <li>I have used it a couple weeks and have noticed any difference except a little more acne, but that could be because of the switch in face product.</li>
            <li>I will stop using my normal regime of products</li>
            <li>I will continue to use it because it claims to be a three week treatment, and will update if I notice anything new.  </li>
            <li>(I can&#x27;t afford throwing away the old products and they did a decent job).  </li>
            <li>It is still warm outside, but the cream is not overly heavy.</li>
            <li>Typically, my skin soaks up most other products quickly - or the product is SO greasy, it lays on top of my skin (attracting small bugs or lint to stick to my face).  </li>
            <li>The product keeps your face feeling very soft.</li>
            <li>far as cost goes it&#x27;s high, but is similar to some high end department store brands like Lancôme, Chanel, and Est&amp;eacute;e Lauder.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear face make-up, have very dry/sensitive skin, and this Facial Serum &amp; Cream Kit is luxury for my face/skin.  </li>
            <li>hydration mineralization, filing wrinkles from within, age-defying antioxidants, and lifting, firming, and toning action.  </li>
            <li>2:  My skin feels soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>3: My skin continues to feel soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>, you can still feel the soft moistness of your face in the morning.  </li>
            <li>I have used many, many less expensive anti-aging moisturizers, because like everyone else would rather look 25 than decades older.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see a marked improvement yet in wrinkles, but I will say the elasticity in my skin has improved and I almost glow.</li>
            <li>My wife has a rough skin texture (which she obviously hates) on her face and is always willing to try anything to soften it which this product does real well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a fine product to use although I am not sure how it compares with lower cost products.</li>
            <li>But a little while later your skin will feel so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Gently massage in - let dry.  </li>
            <li>My old products did well as I always get compliments on my skin and youthful look, but I think this system REVERSED the aging process rather than maintained my look from the time I started using my old routine several years ago.  </li>
            <li>What happened to my skin is it became very itchy and even though the second time I tried it I washed it right off within a half hour of applying, my skin developed these tiny red bumps, sort of like hives, all over.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a fan of the Ageless La Cure Phyto 5 line of cosmetics, and I like this kit in general despite the cream portion feeling a bit too heavy/sticky for my tastes.  </li>
            <li>Once I&#x27;m done with all the product I have of the system, I&#x27;m going back to my old routine to finish them up</li>
            <li>Nice organic line but too expensive.</li>
            <li>I have to call it a failure in its primary mission, given that no one would consider paying this price if it were advertised solely as a moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>The cream is good, but a little thin.</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft but it feels just as soft when I use Suave or any other inexpensive brand of cream.</li>
            <li>I looked at other products by the company on Amazon, and many of them are affordable (even cheaper or at least similar) compared to what I already spend.  </li>
            <li>Even though I use some really strong exfoliators and even Retin-A on my skin, my poor skin just couldn&#x27;t hold up to this stuff.</li>
            <li>A high Return on Investment will depend on how much it can improve skin in 3 weeks, how long that improvement lasts, and how long this system lasts past 3 weeks.  </li>

            <li> Rose is actually very good for sensitive skin, which seems odd to me as the fragance can be pretty strong.</li>
            <li> They claim the cream and serum are organic, local sourced, fair trade, Eco-friendly, and &amp;#34;bio-certified&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> My face has a bit of a glow that I have only seen after using a Glamglow mask, so that is another good sign.</li>
            <li> I guess I have used the product amount wisely as its week 3, and I still have some left.  </li>
            <li> The kit itself is super stylish and modern looking-loved the bottle design</li>
            <li> Otherwise, when this product is gone, I will return to using my more economical current favorite &amp;#34;anti-aging&amp;#34; moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I love this package so far.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this set, really.</li>
            <li> My skin does feel fresh and look brighter using the serum and cream together.</li>
            <li> love that Ageless La Cure uses natural products to produce their products.  </li>
            <li> I use rose hip oil as a daily moisturizer</li>
            <li> Yes, the packaging conveys clean and pure, but since those parts are discarded...</li>
            <li> but as it sits right now I probable would not use this product again after what I have is gone.</li>
            <li> I judge my skin looking younger as worth me continuously buying more.</li>
            <li> I like the serum very much.</li>
            <li> All natural ingredients make it a joy to use with absolutely no greasy feel, no irritation, no lingering scent and no oily sheen!</li>
            <li> after rinsing face, two pumps of just the cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with how delicately and smooth it spreads and soaks into my skin.  </li>
            <li> After the 3 weeks of using this system, I definitely think this system noticeably changed my skin for the better.  </li>
            <li> This is the first time I have bought an organic face lotion</li>
            <li> I used photos to try to limit the placebo effect and make the comparison more objective.  </li>
            <li> With this serum and moisturizing cream set, my skin gets an especially noticeably elegant and refined beauty to it.  </li>
            <li> I noticed a change after the first night.</li>
            <li> reaction may not be typical, so it&#x27;s worth trying on your own.</li>
            <li> The ingredients in their products are very gentle on the skin and from pure sources (not as synthetic as most commercial brands).  </li>
            <li> First, the texture of the serum and the moisturizer is very nice and emollient without being overly thick.</li>
            <li> On larger wrinkles or laugh lines I&#x27;ve noticed just a hint of softening and fine lines are still there too.</li>
            <li> Both products are fine tuned so they can be used by those with sensitive skin, and It is apparent that the ingredients in their products are very gentle, and from natural sources, not synthetics, as most cosmetic brands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d much rather have a bit more product since this is pricey (currently offered on Amazon at $168).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For night time...</li>
            <li> However, after even one week of use, I&#x27;m seeing positive results.</li>
            <li> The kit comes with  very impressive, specific instructions which is a big plus  as that was  not included in some other pricey skin care treatments I have tried.  </li>
            <li> I love the way this cream feels on my dry skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After Week 3:  still going strong with my younger looking face.  </li>

            <li> Many other products I have tried don&#x27;t really seem to do much.</li>

            <li> only downside for me (other than the high price) is I am not a big fan of rose scent - and these definitely have a rose scent.  </li>

            <li> and I don&#x27;t know what they are without looking them up, but the main list is one</li>

            <li> I have used many, many less expensive anti-aging moisturizers, because like everyone else would rather look 25 than decades older.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see a marked improvement yet in wrinkles, but I will say the elasticity in my skin has improved and I almost glow.</li>
            <li> My wife has a rough skin texture (which she obviously hates) on her face and is always willing to try anything to soften it which this product does real well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a fine product to use although I am not sure how it compares with lower cost products.</li>
            <li> But a little while later your skin will feel so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Gently massage in - let dry.  </li>
            <li> My old products did well as I always get compliments on my skin and youthful look, but I think this system REVERSED the aging process rather than maintained my look from the time I started using my old routine several years ago.  </li>
            <li> What happened to my skin is it became very itchy and even though the second time I tried it I washed it right off within a half hour of applying, my skin developed these tiny red bumps, sort of like hives, all over.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fan of the Ageless La Cure Phyto 5 line of cosmetics, and I like this kit in general despite the cream portion feeling a bit too heavy/sticky for my tastes.  </li>
            <li> Once I&#x27;m done with all the product I have of the system, I&#x27;m going back to my old routine to finish them up</li>
            <li> Nice organic line but too expensive.</li>
            <li> I have to call it a failure in its primary mission, given that no one would consider paying this price if it were advertised solely as a moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> The cream is good, but a little thin.</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft but it feels just as soft when I use Suave or any other inexpensive brand of cream.</li>
            <li> I looked at other products by the company on Amazon, and many of them are affordable (even cheaper or at least similar) compared to what I already spend.  </li>
            <li> Even though I use some really strong exfoliators and even Retin-A on my skin, my poor skin just couldn&#x27;t hold up to this stuff.</li>
            <li> A high Return on Investment will depend on how much it can improve skin in 3 weeks, how long that improvement lasts, and how long this system lasts past 3 weeks.  </li>
            <li> Then, I will report if the changes last through going back to the old Lancôme routine (i.e. can these other products maintain the changes?)  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to figure out how long this will last - because of the pump bottles, it&#x27;s hard to tell how much I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li> : I did not have an immediate negative reaction (dryness, redness, and/or tightness of skin) like I have had when using other new products on my face for the first time.  </li>
            <li> Im not sure it will be enough for 3 weeks, but it should at least be enough to get an idea if it works well, and I want to buy more.</li>
            <li> I was surprised that these two items were so small, that said, in this kit, you get a three week supply of serum and beauty cream, the bottles are small and but it only takes a tiny bit of product to adequately cover your face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After using this product for several weeks I have to say that I have not noticed any difference over any other regular face cream.</li>
            <li> As long as it&#x27;s there, I&#x27;m going to use</li>
            <li> I will have to update my review after 30 days of using it because the 30 day + results are the ones that matter in the long run.  </li>
            <li> (Because I am SO dry, two pumps does not give me the coverage Phyto intends, but I&#x27;m also curious how long these will last - and will post an update).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Depending on the difference in my skin I see over the next 3 weeks, I will consider whether to occasionally buy this as a little</li>
            <li> I have always had eczema and dry skin</li>
            <li> The tubes are small looking, but since only the tiniest bit is needed for each application, they are lasting a long while.  </li>
            <li> I tried it twice, figuring maybe it was something else the first time, but the second time was a little worse.</li>
            <li> product is very expensive as are most of the manufacturer&#x27;s other products.</li>
            <li> So, although the product works extremely well, I think you can do the same for a lot less.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It makes this claim:::  &amp;#34; The Ageless Facial Serum and Cream Kit by Phyto 5 is a revolutionary duo which works together to fill-in wrinkles, hydrate, firm and restructure skin.</li>
            <li> I will finish the entire round of treatments that come with the bottles &amp; if anything changes I&#x27;ll update my review</li>
            <li> Of course there is no real cure for aging, but we try all kinds of products to combat its effects.</li>
            <li> Have only used for a few days</li>
            <li> Aging is inevitable and showing its effect is not necessarily a bad or ugly thing</li>
            <li> pick me up or if I should replace my other products.  </li>
            <li> They both have a slightly sticky feel and leave a coating on your skin.</li>
            <li> It does not cause me any irritation, but the serum does feel a bit sticky for a little while after application.</li>
            <li> so I am a little suspicious of a product that touts itself as &amp;#34;ageless&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure whether i see fewer wrinkles, but it has helped to reduce the itchiness I get around my eyes due to dryness.</li>
            <li> I will update after a few weeks to see if I can attest to filled-in wrinkles (I&#x27;m 63), firmer, and a younger/ restructured skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Update</li>
            <li> I will update after a few weeks to see if I can attest to filled-in wrinkles (I&#x27;m 63), firmer, and a younger/ restructured skin.  </li>
            <li> There are a few listed that are chemistry speak</li>
            <li> (not sure what that means).  </li>
            <li> So it would be difficult to pay the asking price for this product, which is its only drawback.</li>
            <li> I like that the ingredients are organic, so the only drawback is that this system is that it is expensive.</li>
            <li> But, it was only faintly noticeable when applying and dissipated immediately.</li>
            <li> This is quite an expensive duo.</li>
            <li> When I run out, I&#x27;d like to repurchase but the product is rather expensive.</li>
            <li> This product is very expensive, but it works well.&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I do love Phyto skin care products.  I don&#x27;t wear face make-up, have very dry/sensitive skin, and this Facial Serum &amp; Cream Kit is luxury for my face/skin.  Typically, my skin soaks up most other products quickly - or the product is SO greasy, it lays on top of my skin (attracting small bugs or lint to stick to my face).  Back to THIS beautiful product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It arrives in a cellophane-wrapped simple white box.  Open the lid to find the two simple white tube inside.  Yes, the packaging conveys clean and pure, but since those parts are discarded...I&#x27;d much rather have a bit more product since this is pricey (currently offered on Amazon at $168).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For night time...after lightly washing my skin, I shake the serum bottle and give two pumps of product to my fingertips.  Gently massage in - let dry.  Give two pumps of the cream - lightly massage into my face/neck.  (Because I am SO dry, two pumps does not give me the coverage Phyto intends, but I&#x27;m also curious how long these will last - and will post an update).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For day time... after rinsing face, two pumps of just the cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with how delicately and smooth it spreads and soaks into my skin.  My skin/face feels moisturized all day (which is RARE...live in a drought-area, summertime, zero humidity).  High praise for this!  Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside for me (other than the high price) is I am not a big fan of rose scent - and these definitely have a rose scent.  While it does dissipate quickly, I prefer a light citrus or ginger type of scent...if any.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes this claim:::  &amp;#34; The Ageless Facial Serum and Cream Kit by Phyto 5 is a revolutionary duo which works together to fill-in wrinkles, hydrate, firm and restructure skin.

            <li> These are a serum and a cream to use every day for better skin. You also get very specific instructions on how to massage the serum and cream into your face and neck.  You use the cream only in the morning and both at night.  The 2 part system is supposed to work together with their &amp;#34;5 Secrets&amp;#34; of Youth:&amp;#34; hydration mineralization, filing wrinkles from within, age-defying antioxidants, and lifting, firming, and toning action.  They claim the cream and serum are organic, local sourced, fair trade, Eco-friendly, and &amp;#34;bio-certified&amp;#34; (not sure what that means).  I also like that it is not tested on animals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is supposed to be a 3 week process so I will be doing updates. I received this product for free in exchange for an unbiased review.  I did not get the same amount of product as they sell on Amazon. Im not sure it will be enough for 3 weeks, but it should at least be enough to get an idea if it works well, and I want to buy more. I will stop using my normal regime of products so I can see what this system does on its own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 1: I did not have an immediate negative reaction (dryness, redness, and/or tightness of skin) like I have had when using other new products on my face for the first time.  I took that as a good start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 2:  My skin feels soft and moisturized. I decided to use 1 pump instead of 2 as a lot of product came out per pump.  I will focus on my face, and anything left over goes to neck, to see if I can make the amount of the system I received last 3 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 3: My skin continues to feel soft and moisturized. My face has a bit of a glow that I have only seen after using a Glamglow mask, so that is another good sign. I had some breakouts before I used this system, and it is helping reduce the red marks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Days 4-14:  I&#x27;m still getting good results. My face is tighter and my pores are more refined.  I think it makes my skin look younger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After Week 3:  still going strong with my younger looking face.  I guess I have used the product amount wisely as its week 3, and I still have some left.  As long as it&#x27;s there, I&#x27;m going to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original analysis of cost:&lt;br /&gt;As far as cost goes it&#x27;s high, but is similar to some high end department store brands like Lancôme, Chanel, and Est&amp;eacute;e Lauder.  A high Return on Investment will depend on how much it can improve skin in 3 weeks, how long that improvement lasts, and how long this system lasts past 3 weeks.  Most of the products I use to fight aging (for example Lancome&#x27;s Genrifique) that cost a lot, I can make last for 6 months. I judge my skin looking younger as worth me continuously buying more. Depending on the difference in my skin I see over the next 3 weeks, I will consider whether to occasionally buy this as a little pick me up or if I should replace my other products.  As it is a three week treatment, I think it is something you may not need to buy all the time any way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final Verdict:  After the 3 weeks of using this system, I definitely think this system noticeably changed my skin for the better.  My old products did well as I always get compliments on my skin and youthful look, but I think this system REVERSED the aging process rather than maintained my look from the time I started using my old routine several years ago.  The $200 price tag is the only thing holding me back from buying it on a regular basis.  If you have the money, I recommend you buy it as often as you feel you need it.  Once I&#x27;m done with all the product I have of the system, I&#x27;m going back to my old routine to finish them up (I can&#x27;t afford throwing away the old products and they did a decent job).  Then, I will report if the changes last through going back to the old Lancôme routine (i.e. can these other products maintain the changes?)

            <li> This is a really deep lasting moisturizer and serum.  One thing to note tho...don&#x27;t put it on and then go straight to bed, it needs time to soak in or it will be sticky to your pillow.  But otherwise it is great, you can still feel the soft moistness of your face in the morning.  Applying the moisturizer in the morning carries you thru the day...and then at night you use both, the serum and the moisturizer.  I will have to update my review after 30 days of using it because the 30 day + results are the ones that matter in the long run.  With the cost for this as high as it is, I have high expectations on the results to be delivered, but so far I am very impressed.</li>
            <li> A great way to moisturize without any oily residue. There is no cakey or lumpy feeling, the lotion adapts perfectly to your skins chemistry. It has a very delicious rose scent. The night serum has helped diminish the look of pours and fine lines. This is the first time I have bought an organic face lotion and I like it better than the chemically laden versions. I have bought creams that are derived from honey or almond and have seen comparative results for a lesser price. So it would be difficult to pay the asking price for this product, which is its only drawback.It also advertises a toner and a cleanser to go along with the creams, which I did not get, so i used my own reasonably priced cleansers, and felt they worked well with it.</li>
            <li> After using this product for several weeks I have to say that I have not noticed any difference over any other regular face cream. I followed the directions explicitly but it doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything special. My skin feels soft but it feels just as soft when I use Suave or any other inexpensive brand of cream. I will finish the entire round of treatments that come with the bottles &amp; if anything changes I&#x27;ll update my review but as it sits right now I probable would not use this product again after what I have is gone.</li>
            <li> This kit when used as directed will give you skin a smooth and glowing appearance and feel. Unlike some moisturizers that make your face all greasy to make it last longer, these products achieve an almost all day moisturizer feel without the greased up tackiness. Both products are fine tuned so they can be used by those with sensitive skin, and It is apparent that the ingredients in their products are very gentle, and from natural sources, not synthetics, as most cosmetic brands. When using you will notice a distinct rose scent that others can detect.</li>
            <li> Update:    I took photos before commencing this trial, and photos after using the this kit for two weeks.  I used photos to try to limit the placebo effect and make the comparison more objective.  I see no discernible difference between the before and after photos.    Original review:  This serum and cream duo are advertised as anti-aging.  For the price you pay, you get 1 Tablespoon of the serum and 2 Tablespoons of the cream.  For the price, I would expect it to be more than just a moisturizer.  I have used many, many less expensive anti-aging moisturizers, because like everyone else would rather look 25 than decades older.  However, as one dermatologist said, &amp;#34;none of these products actually works&amp;#34; or she (50-ish) would look 22, which of course she didn&#x27;t.  The product comes in an elegant box with two pump bottles, and a pamphlet.  The pamphlet instructs you how to massage your face.  There are no instructions on how to use the product, but on the Amazon site there is further information.  You are supposed to use the cream in the morning.  In the evening, use the serum, followed by the cream.  The Phyto 5 serum is said to &amp;#34;fill wrinkles from the inside&amp;#34; and to &amp;#34;provide restoration, protection and much needed hydration.&amp;#34;  The cream is said to be &amp;#34;rich in anti-aging molecules, hydrates, firms and restructures your skin.&amp;#34;  After using the duo for a week, I can attest that it does a half decent job moisturizing my face.  I have not noticed any firming, or restructuring however, nor age defying results.  I have to call it a failure in its primary mission, given that no one would consider paying this price if it were advertised solely as a moisturizer.  I will continue to use it because it claims to be a three week treatment, and will update if I notice anything new.  Otherwise, when this product is gone, I will return to using my more economical current favorite &amp;#34;anti-aging&amp;#34; moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I love this package so far. The main thing I&#x27;m leery of is the price. This is quite an expensive duo. However, after even one week of use, I&#x27;m seeing positive results. It&#x27;s very easy to use. The serum goes on easily, and then cream kit does as well. I&#x27;m noticing some wrinkles diminishing in size, and my face looks more fresh. I&#x27;m trying to figure out how long this will last - because of the pump bottles, it&#x27;s hard to tell how much I&#x27;ve used so far. I&#x27;m hoping this lasts a couple of months.</li>
            <li> Of course there is no real cure for aging, but we try all kinds of products to combat its effects. I really do like this serum and cream. It does not cause me any irritation, but the serum does feel a bit sticky for a little while after application. The scent of roses is nice as well. I only use one pump, not 2, as I this seems to be enough for me. My skin does seem nicely moisturized, and somewhat firmer since using these products. I like that the ingredients are organic, so the only drawback is that this system is that it is expensive. I will continue monitoring the results for improved skin tone, since I am happy with this system so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this is a wonderful product, but I have super sensitive skin. Even though I use some really strong exfoliators and even Retin-A on my skin, my poor skin just couldn&#x27;t hold up to this stuff. I tried it twice, figuring maybe it was something else the first time, but the second time was a little worse. First, the texture of the serum and the moisturizer is very nice and emollient without being overly thick. It has a light clean scent without being overpowering. What happened to my skin is it became very itchy and even though the second time I tried it I washed it right off within a half hour of applying, my skin developed these tiny red bumps, sort of like hives, all over. I still have the remnants, they didn&#x27;t go away after the offending substance was removed. I really wanted to love this set, really. Unfortunately, my skin didn&#x27;t love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My reaction may not be typical, so it&#x27;s worth trying on your own.</li>
            <li> Nice organic line but too expensive.</li>
            <li> Have only used for a few days but it&#x27;s a wonderful kit. The rose scent is a bit strong as it was immediately detectable when I opened the plastic on the box. But, it was only faintly noticeable when applying and dissipated immediately. Rose is actually very good for sensitive skin, which seems odd to me as the fragance can be pretty strong. I have always had eczema and dry skin but this product was not irritating at all. My skin does feel fresh and look brighter using the serum and cream together. All natural ingredients make it a joy to use with absolutely no greasy feel, no irritation, no lingering scent and no oily sheen!</li>
            <li> Aging is inevitable and showing its effect is not necessarily a bad or ugly thing so I am a little suspicious of a product that touts itself as &amp;#34;ageless&amp;#34;.  That said this kit contains a pleasant and effective moisturizer plus a &amp;#34;serum&amp;#34;.  Both products feel good on my skin, have a pleasant flower like scent and caused no blemishes or over drying.  The kit comes with  very impressive, specific instructions which is a big plus  as that was  not included in some other pricey skin care treatments I have tried.  Basically, though, you use the cream in the morning and the serum at night.  These products will make your skin feel good and probably look a bit better but they are not the miraculous fountain of youth so many seek.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quickly becoming a fan of the Ageless La Cure line of Beauty/Cleansing Products.  Their Phyto 5 formula seems to work really well on my ultra-sensitive skin.  The ingredients in their products are very gentle on the skin and from pure sources (not as synthetic as most commercial brands).  I&#x27;ve been using the Phyto Peel for a while now and I like it so much, I save it for special occasions that I need to look especially nice for.  With this serum and moisturizing cream set, my skin gets an especially noticeably elegant and refined beauty to it.  That is one thing that really impresses me about this cream and serum, the fact that they give me a refined look.  I love that!  The tubes are small looking, but since only the tiniest bit is needed for each application, they are lasting a long while.  The premise of htis company is that women shoudln&#x27;t have to compromise for their beauty and they seem to be making it possible for us to do so!  This set is excellent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fan of the Ageless La Cure Phyto 5 line of cosmetics, and I like this kit in general despite the cream portion feeling a bit too heavy/sticky for my tastes.  Instead of using this as the manufacturer suggests - applying the face cream in the morning and the serum and face cream at night -- I tend to use the serum by day and both at night for a smooth, supple skin texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that Ageless La Cure uses natural products to produce their products.  The cream does have a pronounced floral scent that I don&#x27;t mind since I now use it at night, and the serum smells like pleasant astringent.  The kit includes two pump bottles (the serum is smaller than the cream one) that equal together 1.5 ounces.  It doesn&#x27;t seem like a lot of product for the price; however, you only need one or two pumps per application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this product, but I don&#x27;t love it the way I do some of the manufacturer&#x27;s other products.  Still, the results are good, and that&#x27;s what counts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann</li>
            <li> I love the way this cream feels on my dry skin. It is still warm outside, but the cream is not overly heavy. It has a nice scent. Not too strong, just a hint of rose. The box comes with instructions on how to massage the product into the skin. Although this product is for the face and neck, I would recommend using it on your hands too if you are over 40. Often hands can give your age away better than the face can. Skin elasticity seems to be improved after using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a fine product to use although I am not sure how it compares with lower cost products. I experienced no irritation or redness with this kit at all. If you like me are wary of most drugstore brands, this may be the kit for you.</li>
            <li> This product is very expensive, but it works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream is applied in the morning and the serum at night. They both have a slightly sticky feel and leave a coating on your skin. But a little while later your skin will feel so soft and smooth. I noticed a change after the first night. Continued use equals more results. This works. Many other products I have tried don&#x27;t really seem to do much. This however does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the organic ingredients. There are a few listed that are chemistry speak and I don&#x27;t know what they are without looking them up, but the main list is one that I like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is very expensive as are most of the manufacturer&#x27;s other products. They all seem to work well.</li>
            <li> This is a nice face wash and cream. I have used it a couple weeks and have noticed any difference except a little more acne, but that could be because of the switch in face product. The product keeps your face feeling very soft. The face wash smells good but I really don&#x27;t like the smell of the lotion at all.</li>
            <li> When I ordered this facial serum and cream, I hadn&#x27;t noticed the amount they were sending. I thought the product would be in bigger bottles. I was surprised that these two items were so small, that said, in this kit, you get a three week supply of serum and beauty cream, the bottles are small and but it only takes a tiny bit of product to adequately cover your face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed after a week of use that the serum kind of plumps up skin and makes it feel very hydrated. On larger wrinkles or laugh lines I&#x27;ve noticed just a hint of softening and fine lines are still there too. I use rose hip oil as a daily moisturizer so I like the rose scent of this product. The ingredients are safe for sensitive skin and really soothe dry skin and moisturizes very well. I really do like this product and have used it morning and night as directed. When I run out, I&#x27;d like to repurchase but the product is rather expensive. Right now, I am using it very sparingly to make it last. We&#x27;ve had a very hot summer and the natural ingredients feel great on my skin and the hydration looks and feels great throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I received this as part of the Vine program. I will say that I do love the rose fragrance and my skin feels very smooth and soft after about 2 weeks worth of use. I don&#x27;t see a marked improvement yet in wrinkles, but I will say the elasticity in my skin has improved and I almost glow. The only reason why I am rating this as 4 instead of 5 stars is the price. I have seen similar results with Olay Regenerist which is about 25% of this price. So, although the product works extremely well, I think you can do the same for a lot less.</li>
            <li> I like the serum very much. It goes on oily and shiny, so this is something I use at night only. I&#x27;m not sure whether i see fewer wrinkles, but it has helped to reduce the itchiness I get around my eyes due to dryness. The cream is good, but a little thin. I prefer Dr. Hauschka and wouldn&#x27;t replace it with this cream. Recommend the serum.</li>
            <li> One of the nicest skin care products that we ever had. The kit itself is super stylish and modern looking-loved the bottle design also-marketing did a great job there. The product itself smelled great after application and stuck around for several hours afterward which was real nice. It softened the skin after multiple applications actually after the second application we started noticing a difference. My wife has a rough skin texture (which she obviously hates) on her face and is always willing to try anything to soften it which this product does real well. It did not make any of her wrinkles go away which we did not think it would do but it did a great job softening and giving her a nice glow-which makes me happy to see her happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;High end face product that works!</li>
