            <li>The Babyliss gives it a nice smooth finish, I would say comparable to the Chi</li>
            <li>i love it</li>
            <li>Love this model except I can&#x27;t seem to find it anymore.</li>
            <li>I really love it.</li>
            <li>It was fine and then one day it won&#x27;t turn on anymore.  </li>
            <li>I have bought Babyliss straightening irons since I got one free at a Beauty Show.  </li>
            <li>I think is was a cheap conaire or something.</li>
            <li>Ordered this flat iron on Amazon for a great price.  </li>
            <li>This BaByliss straightner leaves my hair straight and shiny and smoothe, something I&#x27;ve never been able to do until now.</li>
            <li>It heats up very fast and the temperature is adjustable to fit anyone&#x27;s type of hair.</li>
            <li>It heats up really fast and makes my hair smooth.</li>
            <li>This was well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Lightweight and heats quickly so its fast and convenient.</li>
            <li>This one gets very hot and it heats up fast.  </li>
            <li>Delivery is fast!</li>
            <li>but I was able to use this whith some degree of expertise with no prior experience.  </li>
            <li>Love this product it is comperable to the chi flat iron.</li>
            <li>This flat iron does what it says and even more.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone who have been searching for a miracle flat iron :)</li>
            <li>My old flat iron wouldn&#x27;t effectively straighten my hair, even though it is pretty straight to begin with.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, one of the best flat irons I&#x27;ve ever owned and will probably end up buying the larger plated version too.</li>
            <li>Even now that I dont have permed hair; I still have really thick and frizzy hair, but this flat iron continues to do a great job at straightening my hair quickly.  </li>
            <li>The results are phenominal, and my hair stays straight from wash to wash.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very upset that this didn&#x27;t even work for a year.  </li>
            <li>So I tried this iron that really works.</li>
            <li>I was really hoping I&#x27;d like this one.  </li>
            <li>I really like this iron.  </li>
            <li>My hair is really stubborn and really curly.</li>
            <li>It is easy to manipulate due to the swivel cord and the temperature control gives just the right amount of heat for my hair.  </li>
            <li>this was the first time I let my hair air dry and use the iron only, and what an amazing result.</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it does not have auto shut-off, but I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s a professional iron and professional stylists</li>
            <li>Leaves it very shiny and natural looking without the hassle.</li>
            <li>in 1/2 the time, I got the most beautifull hair that lasted for me a week long, even in a dry humide wheather.    </li>
            <li>The cord it also extra long so you can easily maneuver it.</li>
            <li>I had thick permed hair when I purchased this flat iron, and it worked amazingly on it when I wanted the straight look.</li>
            <li>but with this product  instantly takes away moisture that causes frizz and makes my hair straight.</li>
            <li>I think i&#x27;ve bought 5 so far in my life time.</li>
            <li>I have had many a hair straightner in the past!  </li>
            <li>Also, this flat iron REALLY pulls your hair.  </li>
            <li>The iron itself is excellent, but the control for the heat temperature is in a place that&#x27;s nearly impossible to read!</li>
            <li>It heats up really fast; within a few seconds, and I never use it on 450 degree setting, but it works really well.</li>
            <li>My old flat iron just broke after 6 years of use.</li>
            <li>It barely got my hair straight and it left it extremely frizzy.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> The only reason I&#x27;m not giving this item 5 Stars is because when you close the flat iron, the heating plates don&#x27;t fully touch towards the inside (just by a millimeter or so).  </li>
            <li> I just started using a flat iron and the one I bought from a local store didn&#x27;t get hot enough for my thick hair.  </li>
            <li> The only downside is the handle outside the plates gets very hot, so you have to be a bit careful not to burn yourself if you want to clamp it down tightly to straighten.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had a slight natural wave in the back of my hair which I&#x27;ve wanted to eliminate.  </li>
            <li> and I use Sabino Lok &#x27;n blok with the flat iron.</li>
            <li> This flat iron does it for me.  </li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll just buy another HAI flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, naturally curly hair, that was always left frizzy even after straightning with our conair straightner.</li>
            <li> The only downside is that unlike the chi it has a tendency to tug on a few hairs because there&#x27;s space between the ceramic plates and the flat iron itself.</li>
            <li> This is all I have wished for in an iron, I have owned several models before from cheap to very expensive models, I have been styling my hair myself for over 15 years.</li>
            <li> There is absolutely no damage to this product on my part</li>
            <li> once or twice every other day till I wash again.</li>
            <li> Not sure why I decided to try a different brand.  </li>
            <li> I have Thick Wavy hair ( a Looooooot of it) and I usually have to do my hair on 2 steps, Blow dry with a round silk brush, than Flat iron it and than I have to flat iron it</li>
            <li> It operates like a pro and wil never let you down.  </li>
            <li> It cuts half the time of straigthening my daughters hair.</li>
            <li> I used it once and the black pieces on the ends of the plates came off.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, curly, long hair.</li>
            <li> I can straighten my hair in about 10-15 mins (my hair is a little longer than shoulder length).</li>
            <li> What a waste of money!</li>
            <li> Usually I&#x27;d have to blow it out and then straighten it with a straightener</li>
            <li> I had a flat iron before I ordered this one that was utter crap.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t burn my thick and unrully wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick hair...</li>
            <li> I was really tired of going to the hair salon to have my hair done and spend hours, money, etc...</li>
            <li> I have thin hair</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!</li>
            <li> Very poorly made.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I have NEVER been disappointed in my BaByliss!!!  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> I have bought Babyliss straightening irons since I got one free at a Beauty Show.  I have NEVER been disappointed in my BaByliss!!!  It operates like a pro and wil never let you down.  Love Love LOVE my BaByliss!!!!!</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;m a novice when it comes to haircare tools. I had a flat iron before I ordered this one that was utter crap. It barely got my hair straight and it left it extremely frizzy. I forget the brand....I think is was a cheap conaire or something. Well, I&#x27;ve straightened my hair with this iron twice now, and it leaves my hair silky smooth and incredibly shiny. The product I use in conjunction with it probably helps with the shine too though. I have very thick hair...I&#x27;d say 4a/4b....and I use Sabino Lok &#x27;n blok with the flat iron. The results are phenominal, and my hair stays straight from wash to wash. I&#x27;m a very happy customer.</li>
            <li> I have had many a hair straightner in the past!  This one is the best.  It doesn&#x27;t burn my thick and unrully wavy hair.  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product in April 2010 from Cosmetic Solutions and it no longer works!  It was fine and then one day it won&#x27;t turn on anymore.  There is absolutely no damage to this product on my part and I even keep it in it&#x27;s own case.  Cosmetic Solutions will not exchange or refund my money and I&#x27;m very upset that this didn&#x27;t even work for a year.  What a waste of money!</li>
            <li> I already own this straightener and love it, so I had to buy one for my daughter for her birthday! She would come over to my house to straighten her hair--and she owned a Chi! This is now my daughter&#x27;s favorite straightener as well!</li>
            <li> Love this product it is comperable to the chi flat iron. Lightweight and heats quickly so its fast and convenient. The only downside is that unlike the chi it has a tendency to tug on a few hairs because there&#x27;s space between the ceramic plates and the flat iron itself. Otherwise I give it two thumbs up.</li>
            <li> Delivery is fast! I received the item in excellent brand new condition. This flat iron does what it says and even more. It cuts half the time of straigthening my daughters hair. Leaves it very shiny and natural looking without the hassle. It heats up very fast and the temperature is adjustable to fit anyone&#x27;s type of hair. I love it!!!</li>
            <li> I had thick permed hair when I purchased this flat iron, and it worked amazingly on it when I wanted the straight look.

I am satisfied with my purchase and so happy because I save time, money and my hair looks healthy and shiny.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve always had a slight natural wave in the back of my hair which I&#x27;ve wanted to eliminate.  This flat iron does it for me.  I do realize almost any flat-iron would do the same but I can plug this in and use it almost immediately.  It is easy to manipulate due to the swivel cord and the temperature control gives just the right amount of heat for my hair.  I have never used an iron before but I was able to use this whith some degree of expertise with no prior experience.  It is now my favorite hair tool and I use it almost every day.</li>
            <li> I love this straightener. It heats up really fast and makes my hair smooth. The cord it also extra long so you can easily maneuver it. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> My mom bought this for me for my birthday.  I used it once and the black pieces on the ends of the plates came off.  They are only glued on.  The glue heats up and they fall off.  I didn&#x27;t even have it on the hottest setting.  Very poorly made.  Also, this flat iron REALLY pulls your hair.  I&#x27;m extremely disappointed.  My old flat iron just broke after 6 years of use. I was really hoping I&#x27;d like this one.  I think I&#x27;ll just buy another HAI flat iron.  Not sure why I decided to try a different brand.  DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!</li>
            <li> I have thick, naturally curly hair, that was always left frizzy even after straightning with our conair straightner. This is the best purchase I have ever made for my hair! This BaByliss straightner leaves my hair straight and shiny and smoothe, something I&#x27;ve never been able to do until now. I also bought the Tresemme heat styling protector, and I now love my hair. This was well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I really like this iron.  I just started using a flat iron and the one I bought from a local store didn&#x27;t get hot enough for my thick hair.

The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it does not have auto shut-off, but I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s a professional iron and professional stylists wouldn&#x27;t want their equipment turning off on it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li> Ordered this flat iron on Amazon for a great price.  My old flat iron wouldn&#x27;t effectively straighten my hair, even though it is pretty straight to begin with.  The Babyliss gives it a nice smooth finish, I would say comparable to the Chi iron my hair-stylist uses.  Never had any problem with it pulling hair.</li>
            <li> The only reason I&#x27;m not giving this item 5 Stars is because when you close the flat iron, the heating plates don&#x27;t fully touch towards the inside (just by a millimeter or so).  I have thin hair so I have to squeeze the plates together in that one spot when using it to get evenness out of the plates.  If I had thicker hair, I don&#x27;t think this would be an issue.  Other than that, one of the best flat irons I&#x27;ve ever owned and will probably end up buying the larger plated version too.</li>
            <li> The iron itself is excellent, but the control for the heat temperature is in a place that&#x27;s nearly impossible to read! Why in the world would anyone put the control button between the ceramic and the top of the iron!!! In the picture it appears the heat control is on the outside of the iron, but it is not.  I continue to use it, but with caution!</li>
            <li> This is a great value. It&#x27;s a ceramic straightener, so it won&#x27;t damage your hair. It straightens just as well as the 200 dollar straightener I broke before purchasing this one, which is really impressive. It heats up quickly and is very effective. The only downside is the handle outside the plates gets very hot, so you have to be a bit careful not to burn yourself if you want to clamp it down tightly to straighten. Not a big deal, though.</li>
            <li> It works perfect on my hair leaved it straight n I can save me money from not getting it done at a shop...i love it</li>
            <li> Love this model except I can&#x27;t seem to find it anymore. I would like to order another one but now they have a newer model! Love it!</li>
            <li> My wife likes the iron and I would recommend it. Good Value for the price paid.  This is a good buy.</li>
            <li> My hair is really stubborn and really curly. Usually I&#x27;d have to blow it out and then straighten it with a straightener but with this product  instantly takes away moisture that causes frizz and makes my hair straight. They kind of not work anymore after 3-4 years i guess but thats all straighteners. I think i&#x27;ve bought 5 so far in my life time. I really love it. Its the only thing that works for my hair.</li>
