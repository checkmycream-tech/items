            <li>It doesn&#x27;t need too much of an explanation on the product</li>
            <li>Very flimsy and there is no way to stick it to itself - so that is an issue.  </li>
            <li>Nothing to really report that will blow you away, these neck strips work as they should.</li>
            <li>I liked making thing complete was neck strips to keep the hair from falling down between my neck and the cape.</li>
            <li>we don&#x27;t have overweight family members with large necks but fitting those requires maximum stretching of the strip which is not particularly comfortable.  </li>
            <li>Using a cape of any kind without these allows hair to go  down your back.</li>
            <li>I am a home barber and I have bought all of the equipment used in an old time barber shop.</li>
            <li>For people that hate stuff around their neck these are awesome.</li>
            <li>I have bought a set of professional clippers, different cutter blades, neck brush, mirrors, combs, brushes, cape and all</li>
            <li>Good Product and strips are extra long and thick!!!</li>

            <li> I am a home barber and I have bought all of the equipment used in an old time barber shop. I have bought a set of professional clippers, different cutter blades, neck brush, mirrors, combs, brushes, cape and all I liked making thing complete was neck strips to keep the hair from falling down between my neck and the cape. These Sanek strips are what barbers use and they work fine for me. I will continue using them as long as I am able to cut my hair as well as my grandson&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased these for when I cut my husbands hair at home.  He loves how they help keep the hair out from under the cape and also keep the cape from being itchy</li>
            <li> Love these things. Perforations are just right, because I don&#x27;t have to struggle while pulling them apart. Thank you Graham!</li>
            <li> My wife cuts my hair - these work great! ........ They&#x27;re stretchy a little bit but nothing too fancy.  Just throw them away when you&#x27;re done with your haircut.  I got a Betty Dain Betty Dain Classic Stripe Barber Cutting Cape to go with.</li>
            <li> Good Product and strips are extra long and thick!!! Keeps The hair out... I think this is a good deal.</li>
            <li> it serves it&#x27;s purpose well.  My son does not complain about the itchies anymore.  job well done neck strips...thanks alot</li>
            <li> Same as description, I will buy this product again, arrived on time and well packed, was very helpful the previous reviews to decide to buy this product.</li>
            <li> these strips are more on the shorter side. we don&#x27;t have overweight family members with large necks but fitting those requires maximum stretching of the strip which is not particularly comfortable.  Also they are thin</li>
            <li> When buying these neck stripes I had bought a neck duster with it. I was in desperate need of them because the cape I had was irritating peoples necks when they would wear them. Now since buying them people have had a soothing feeling when wearing the cape. They are good quality and don&#x27;t rip easily like some that i have seen before. These neck strips are also fairly soft against the skin and go perfect with the new cape and neck duster I just purchased with these. I am happy with the money i spent here and recommend these neck strips to any hair stylist who needs them. You will love how good they are for their price.</li>
            <li> Great for keeping the hair from falling down my neck when shaving my head. Easy to put on tightly and comfortable.</li>
            <li> I was very satisfied with the strips. Good service and would order again if needed.&lt;br /&gt;Not much else to say about throw away strips.</li>
            <li> Came in poor packaging and the neck strips were all bent and messed up.</li>
            <li> I cut my almost 4yo son&#x27;s hair at home.  He HATES getting hair down his shirt etc so I bought these and it did the trick.  He argues much less about dad cutting his hair now... :)</li>
            <li> Doing home haircuts just basically. Much more comfortable to use than without. It eliminates all the hair on the neck and having to clean up after the haircut. Pretty much like getting a haircut at the shop. Very comfortable when done.</li>
            <li> awefully tiny package of neck strips. probably wouldve dome better if i just went to sallys</li>
            <li> good item at a fair price</li>
            <li> These neck strips are too rough and leave the neck red/sore.</li>
            <li> My wife cuts my hair, and I&#x27;ve always hated getting hair under my cape and into my shirt.  This has been a great solution, and one that should last a long time for a cheap price.</li>
            <li> For people that hate stuff around their neck these are awesome. In SC we must have something in between the cape and the neck due to sanitation rules. These are great instead of towels and less laundry!</li>
            <li> Not gonna find a better set of neck strips for the price. They have good deals on these and you see a lot of Barbers using them.</li>
            <li> these work great but hubby hates them!</li>
            <li> This was a good choice. I would buy again.. Helps keep hair from getting everywheres. My son was Happy with it</li>
            <li> Helps with keeping the hair from falling below the neck and down the  shirt when cutting.&lt;br /&gt;Make certain you have or order the dispenser !&lt;br /&gt;Nice to have. Glad I purchased them</li>
            <li> A great add-on to any hairdresser,barber,hairstylist, etc. Protect hair from falling between the cape and the clients neck. It also catches any drips of sprays and such. Only thing is its hard to efficiently remove the strip from each other without using  a dispenser. Nontheless, great product, will last you about 50-60 clients, depending on use and handling.</li>
            <li> I have only used one strip but it is just as advertized, it worked as intended.  I don&#x27;t expect any problems with them.</li>
            <li> I bought these along with a cape. Using a cape of any kind without these allows hair to go  down your back. These stop that.</li>
            <li> This seems to work ok for the haircuts I give my boys.  You really can&#x27;t beat it for the price.</li>
            <li> I did not find out how it is worked. It seems like not to product. This good need to improve.</li>
            <li> these are great for salon or home when u giving cuts keeps neck clean of hair one bad thing dispenser is  15 bucks a lot yo keep neck stripes in i have them on the counter great product</li>
            <li> This product is a gift for my daughter in law who does my hair.  These will be very nice for her to use when she gives me my next perm.  The service was absolutely great from the shipper and the product was just what I wanted.  I would order from them again.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t need too much of an explanation on the product but I went ahead and purchased these for home haircutting. It&#x27;s not necessary but a \\&quot;nice to have\\&quot; product. I&#x27;m satisfied with the purchase and they&#x27;re cheap to buy as well.</li>
            <li> Very flimsy and there is no way to stick it to itself - so that is an issue.  I wrap it around my son&#x27;s neck and then what?  It does not stay.&lt;br /&gt;Waste of money if you ask me.</li>
            <li> i got it for when my friends &amp; i cut each others hair&lt;br /&gt;its deffenately not needed but does help keep hair from getting all over the neck&lt;br /&gt;(obviously must be used under a barbers cape)</li>
            <li> Great product really easy to use and the most important thing really  soft for your custumers neck and they are super clean.</li>
            <li> Nothing to really report that will blow you away, these neck strips work as they should. I do recommend them.</li>
            <li> Does the job; I use them every time I cut my hubby&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> top notch products, always great prices  to compare and will always recommend!! comes in handy when cutting or styling hair.</li>
            <li> Great product and seller.</li>
