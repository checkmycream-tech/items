            <li>It is nice to have people who know how to sell and make things easy for us to order.</li>
            <li>No need to say more.  </li>
            <li>Seem to work as well as those from hearing aid place at a much better price</li>
            <li>Based on the outstanding reviews I decided to give the Zeni batteries a try.</li>
            <li>The packaging for the Zeni cells is better than the Costco making the Zeni cells easier to dispense.</li>
            <li>The price is better but that is all.</li>
            <li>These batteries are as good as any I gave ever used and much more reasonable!</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are really great high performance hearing aid batteries.</li>
            <li>what a great price, we have yet to see if they last 1 week like the ones that he purchased from the store in town.  </li>
            <li>Batteries are a great price and last about 4 days if using them every day.  </li>
            <li>They were cheap, so I guess I got what I paid for.</li>
            <li>The price was fantastic and delivery was as stated.  </li>
            <li>They are original equipment manufacturers,&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li>I use Siemens 701 aids that were equipped originally with rechargeable batteries.</li>
            <li>last well and are a good value&lt;br /&gt;Cheaper than the drugstores, etx</li>
            <li>The price difference is tremendous.  </li>
            <li>So far batteries seem to be good - charged and ready to go.  </li>
            <li>My purchase should have been for more of this item to get the total up to a more advantageous level.</li>
            <li>But, we returned them and our money was quickly refunded to our credit card.</li>
            <li>the price is excellent, but they last only 3 - 4 days, still, for the money, they are well worth it.</li>
            <li>Batteries now lasting 5-6 days, maybe more!  </li>
            <li>These batteries are economical and long-lasting.</li>
            <li>They come quickly and have worked very well in my hearing aids.  </li>
            <li>on&#x27;t be afraid of these, Good,good,goood, good , good</li>
            <li>I like these batteries very much.  </li>
            <li>Will most likely purchase from them again.  </li>
            <li>No reason to pay more for something that works in the same fashion.  </li>
            <li>The Costco cells would consistently provide 9 to ten days of service, the Zeni cells are good for barely 7 days.</li>
            <li>My uncle says that they don&#x27;t last as long as the big brand names, but he also says that even so, the work perfectly and at the end of the day he  has saved a lot of money on them.</li>
            <li>They come with a small plastic tab that makes it easy to put them in without touching them.</li>
            <li>The price is reasonable and they last&lt;br /&gt;just as long as batteries that I have paid much more for.  </li>
            <li>but I certainly will reorder.</li>
            <li>but at  a much lower cost.</li>
            <li>they were so much cheaper.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely would buy them again.</li>
            <li>Delivery was fast.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve used Duracell for a year, Energizer for 5-6 months, and Rayovac for 3 years) and much cheaper.  </li>
            <li>Drugstores and hearing aid retailers sell name brand hearing aid batteries for more than twice the cost and only last 3 or 4 days in my hearing aids.  </li>
            <li>A decent life.</li>
            <li>I get six full days on my new digital HAids.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the seller and the product(though</li>
            <li>I would recommend them highly.</li>
            <li>Great price ..Works as well as the expensive ones.. would buy again..</li>
            <li>Overall, very much worth the price savings.</li>
            <li>Their price was low and we received the order right away.  </li>
            <li>Both my wife and I are new to the world of hearing aids.  </li>
            <li>These batteries work fine but don&#x27;t last so long.</li>
            <li>The packaging is compact, green, and easy to handle.</li>
            <li>We are loyal Texas Exe&#x27;s, (Lifetime), but you have let us down this time.  </li>
            <li>These were recommended to me by a profoundly deaf activist.</li>
            <li>These batteries work just as well and last as long as the higher priced ones.  </li>
            <li>Very good quality, long lasting, (just as long as expensive batteries).</li>
            <li>We get the same use (about 75 hours / 5-6 days; volume at 3-4 / 10 for normal use - higher for TV and theater) that we have with other generic batteries.&lt;br</li>
            <li>my father is on a fixed income, so i bought these for him, enough for just over 1 year.  </li>
            <li>These hearing aid batteries seem to last as long or longer than some of the move expensive ones,  and the shelf life is good.</li>

            <li> These hearing aid batteries seem to last as long or longer than some of the move expensive ones,  and the shelf life is good.</li>
            <li> This is important because if you touch both the positive and negative on those little batteries, you will drain half the life out of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am so surprised that these last longer than the other batteries I had.  </li>
            <li> Lasts just as long as much more expensive batteries.</li>
            <li> I will keep ordering them as long as they keep coming with the same quality.</li>
            <li> Having little to compare these with, they seem to get the job done as far as supplying the needed power, and they are lasting about as long as the batteries that came with our devices.  </li>
            <li> I have found no difference in quality from the high priced name brand I had been using,  they last five days, which is about the same give or take a few hours of the name brand and are half the cost, I will be ordering them again.</li>
            <li> I bought them a second time and now they last an average of 2-3 days.  </li>
            <li> I expected the same from these; however, all I got was just over one week.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure they are lasting as well as the more expensive brands.  </li>
            <li> They were advertised as lasting longer than other batteries.</li>
            <li> I get the same amout off use from these as I do any other ones.</li>
            <li> Hearing aids use battery power different from each other.</li>
            <li> The zinc air per year cost was less and usage time per day was not limited to 12 or 13 hours.</li>
            <li> these batteries seem to last about as long as the ones we have been using, possibly slightly less.</li>
            <li> After finishing the previous supply, I started on these several days ago.</li>
            <li> The ZeniPower batteries are less than half the cost and last over two weeks in my aids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have found no difference in the length of service between these and any of the other brands that I have used.  </li>
            <li> and that is two days longer than my other batteries which were Costco brand.</li>
            <li> First two batteries out of the package failed within 2 hours.</li>
            <li> Other batteries lasted two weeks.  </li>
            <li> Every time we buy other batteries they measure up to the 1.45.  </li>
            <li> These last about 5 days which is a couple days less than the Ray O Vacs I usually get.</li>
            <li> They work just as well as  other hearing aid batteries and cost a lot less.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m having to change in less than a week sometimes.</li>
            <li> Am accustomed to a 4 day cycle with almost any brand I have used previously.</li>
            <li> A year&#x27;s supply for less than $40.</li>
            <li> The sting of poor quality lasts longer than the sweetness of low price.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve used them in the past and will continue to use them again and again.</li>
            <li> Waste of money!</li>
            <li> while this is about a year&#x27;s supply, they are dated well past the time we plan to use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
            <li> For me, these batteries are no better than any others I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> I usually buy at least 2 boxes</li>
            <li> Hard to evaluate.</li>
            <li> Much less expensive than the brand name batteries my husband had been purchasing from his hearing aid provider.</li>
            <li> He uses hearing aids and this is a less expensive way to insure he always has extras on hand.</li>
            <li> How can you go wrong?</li>
            <li> I thought maybe I was crazy, so I kept track on my calendar every time I changed them.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I like these batteries very much.  The price is reasonable and they last&lt;br /&gt;just as long as batteries that I have paid much more for.  I would&lt;br /&gt;recommend these for anyone who needs this type of product.</li>
            <li> Batteries arrived on time and work just like the name brands I&#x27;ve been buying but at  a much lower cost. How can you go wrong?</li>
            <li> My uncle says that they don&#x27;t last as long as the big brand names, but he also says that even so, the work perfectly and at the end of the day he  has saved a lot of money on them. In a word, they are good quality and better value. No need to say more.  They come with a small plastic tab that makes it easy to put them in without touching them. This is important because if you touch both the positive and negative on those little batteries, you will drain half the life out of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Super value, and well made.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a problem with this company&#x27;s batteries. Started with size 13 for years and now the 312. Very good product.</li>
            <li> It is nice to have people who know how to sell and make things easy for us to order. Thank you for your service</li>
            <li> I bought these b/c they were so much cheaper.  I&#x27;m not sure they are lasting as well as the more expensive brands.  I&#x27;m having to change in less than a week sometimes.</li>
            <li> Purchased for two hearing aids (Resound). After finishing the previous supply, I started on these several days ago. They consistently last two days. Am accustomed to a 4 day cycle with almost any brand I have used previously. Merritt, Dallas, Tx</li>
            <li> Have had hearing aids for 20 years now and have used all of the different brands of batteries out there.  I decided to give these a try because of the cost saving.  I have found no difference in the length of service between these and any of the other brands that I have used.  A+</li>
            <li> my father is on a fixed income, so i bought these for him, enough for just over 1 year.  what a great price, we have yet to see if they last 1 week like the ones that he purchased from the store in town.  The price difference is tremendous.  what a great buy</li>
            <li> I have been wearing hearing aids for over 40 years and sometimes I truly wonder what&#x27;s going on in the hearing aid battery business.  Drugstores and hearing aid retailers sell name brand hearing aid batteries for more than twice the cost and only last 3 or 4 days in my hearing aids.  The ZeniPower batteries are less than half the cost and last over two weeks in my aids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are really great high performance hearing aid batteries.</li>
            <li> I am so surprised that these last longer than the other batteries I had.  I get six full days on my new digital HAids. and that is two days longer than my other batteries which were Costco brand.</li>
            <li> I have been using these batteries for years without any problems. I can&#x27;t imagine the more expensive batteries las any longer than these do.</li>
            <li> Good value for the money.  Lasts just as long as much more expensive batteries. I usually buy at least 2 boxes so I don&#x27;t run out.</li>
            <li> Batteries arrived when they said they would.  So far batteries seem to be good - charged and ready to go.  Price was great too.</li>
            <li> I have been using ZENPOWER for some time with no problems.</li>
            <li> Very good quality, long lasting, (just as long as expensive batteries). The price is awesome, i love love love the price!!!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent supplier. Just as promised and timely. Thank you, kindly.</li>
            <li> This was my third order for these batteries.  They come quickly and have worked very well in my hearing aids.  I will keep ordering them as long as they keep coming with the same quality.</li>
            <li> These batteries work fine but don&#x27;t last so long. These last about 5 days which is a couple days less than the Ray O Vacs I usually get.</li>
            <li> We are loyal Texas Exe&#x27;s, (Lifetime), but you have let us down this time.  The batteries only last about 4-5 days.  We will never buy this brand again.</li>
            <li> These batteries deliver the same power and have the same longevity as the premium batteries sold by the audiologist who sold me the hearing aids.  Even the package is the same.  The difference? One-third of the price. A year&#x27;s supply for less than $40. Why buy anything else?</li>
            <li> The wait time for receiving this product was only two business days......fantastic! The batteries are of excellent quality, and at a very reasonable price. I highly recommend the seller and the product(though they are made in China).</li>
            <li> These batteries are as good as any I gave ever used and much more reasonable! Absolutely would buy them again.</li>
            <li> Seem to work as well as those from hearing aid place at a much better price</li>
            <li> My purchase should have been for more of this item to get the total up to a more advantageous level. I use two batteries per week and would have obtained batteries for 60 weeks had I bought two.</li>
            <li> Both my wife and I are new to the world of hearing aids.  Based on what I&#x27;ve read, two things seem to matter:  the strength of the charge and the life of the battery. Having little to compare these with, they seem to get the job done as far as supplying the needed power, and they are lasting about as long as the batteries that came with our devices.  Given the difference in price between these and the originals, I say these are a good value.</li>
            <li> First two batteries out of the package failed within 2 hours. The sting of poor quality lasts longer than the sweetness of low price.</li>
            <li> Much less expensive than the brand name batteries my husband had been purchasing from his hearing aid provider. And, they work just as well!</li>
            <li> These batteries work just as well and last as long as the higher priced ones.  Product was as described.  Delivery was fast.  Very, very satisfied and will re-order as needed.  Great seller</li>
            <li> I have ordered these before and am quite happy with them.</li>
            <li> We ordered this item from mybatterysupplier.com.  Their price was low and we received the order right away.  The company gives great service.  We&#x27;ve used them in the past and will continue to use them again and again.</li>
            <li> My husband orders these from Amazon.com every 6 months and has for several years now.  He uses hearing aids and this is a less expensive way to insure he always has extras on hand.</li>
            <li> the price is excellent, but they last only 3 - 4 days, still, for the money, they are well worth it.</li>
            <li> Batteries are a great price and last about 4 days if using them every day.  Do not have a lot of experience in purchasing batteries since the initial supply that came from the audiologist lasted about two months.  Will most likely purchase from them again.  Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> Batteries were received on time and the product was as advertised. The quality of the batteries is excellent as I receive 5 days of service from each battery, that is wearing the aids aprox. 18 hrs per day. this is great value for the money</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these batteries in a pair of Agil Pro hearing aids for six months.  They last 5-7 days.  They work just as well as  other hearing aid batteries and cost a lot less.  Haven&#x27;t found a dud in the entire shipment of 120.  I am about to order them again. (Adding a comment April 2012)  These batteries have continued to give good service.  I continue to recommend them.</li>
            <li> A decent life. Well packaged and an excellent price. I can&#x27;t write a chapter on hearing cell batteries but I certainly will reorder.</li>
            <li> I have found no difference in quality from the high priced name brand I had been using,  they last five days, which is about the same give or take a few hours of the name brand and are half the cost, I will be ordering them again.</li>
            <li> 2nd purchase! The batteries seem to work well</li>
            <li> Batteries now lasting 5-6 days, maybe more!  For the price a really good buy.  Will definitely renew when these run out.</li>
            <li> This is Michael&#x27;s wife.  I bought these batteries over a year ago and they were great...lasted up to 6 days.  I bought them a second time and now they last an average of 2-3 days.  I thought maybe I was crazy, so I kept track on my calendar every time I changed them.  It was every 2 days.  Waste of money!</li>
            <li> Works just as good as Rayovac, Duracell, and Energizer (I&#x27;ve used Duracell for a year, Energizer for 5-6 months, and Rayovac for 3 years) and much cheaper.  No reason to pay more for something that works in the same fashion.  I have not noticed any change in battery power or quality.  Good stuff!</li>
            <li> these batteries seem to last about as long as the ones we have been using, possibly slightly less. That is the reason for only four stars. My wife has been using up the ones she had before and has only used these once or twice for comparison. Overall, very much worth the price savings. Would recommend them wholeheartedly.</li>
            <li> These were recommended to me by a profoundly deaf activist. They are original equipment manufacturers,&lt;br /&gt;They last well and are a good value&lt;br /&gt;Cheaper than the drugstores, etx</li>
            <li> These are \\&quot;generic\\&quot; hearing aid batteries.  We get the same use (about 75 hours / 5-6 days; volume at 3-4 / 10 for normal use - higher for TV and theater) that we have with other generic batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of the larger package size (120 instead of 60) and the spreading of shipping charges, these give a lower price / battery.  We also like the smaller wheel package and the fact that each battery is still taped for charge protection.  Note while this is about a year&#x27;s supply, they are dated well past the time we plan to use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
            <li> I use Siemens 701 aids that were equipped originally with rechargeable batteries. The original batteries were good for about 13 hours per charge and lasted for about 8 months. I switched to Costco 312 zinc air batteries. The zinc air per year cost was less and usage time per day was not limited to 12 or 13 hours. Based on the outstanding reviews I decided to give the Zeni batteries a try. The cost per cell is about the same as the Costco batteries. The difference is in performance. The Costco cells would consistently provide 9 to ten days of service, the Zeni cells are good for barely 7 days. It should also be noted that the Costco cells are made in the USA and the Zeni cells are made in China. The packaging for the Zeni cells is better than the Costco making the Zeni cells easier to dispense. I intend to switch back to the Costco cells based on their longer life resulting in a cost savings of about 30%.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have ordered these batteries.  They last 3 to four days of 14-16 hours of continual use.  I will order them again.  I will recommend them to a friend.</li>
            <li> The batteries were shipped promptly and were as described.  Time will tell if they continue to perform before expiration date.</li>
            <li> Great price ..Works as well as the expensive ones.. would buy again..on&#x27;t be afraid of these, Good,good,goood, good , good</li>
            <li> They were advertised as lasting longer than other batteries. They DO NOT.  I get the same amout off use from these as I do any other ones. The price is better but that is all.</li>
            <li> For me, these batteries are no better than any others I&#x27;ve used but they&#x27;re cheaper than the name-brand ones in stores.</li>
            <li> These hearing aid batteries seem to last as long or longer than some of the move expensive ones,  and the shelf life is good.</li>
            <li> Hard to evaluate. Hearing aids use battery power different from each other. They don&#x27;t all consume power at the same rate.</li>
            <li> Other batteries lasted two weeks.  I expected the same from these; however, all I got was just over one week.  They were cheap, so I guess I got what I paid for.</li>
            <li> We tested the batteries with a meter when we got them and they were below power level.  Company says they must be in the hearing aid and will then power up.  Doubt that.  Every time we buy other batteries they measure up to the 1.45.  But, we returned them and our money was quickly refunded to our credit card. Happy with that.</li>
            <li> The price was fantastic and delivery was as stated.  I have created a chart to check the battery life.  The length of time between changes has been 6-7 days.</li>
            <li> These batteries are economical and long-lasting. I would recommend them highly. The packaging is compact, green, and easy to handle.</li>
