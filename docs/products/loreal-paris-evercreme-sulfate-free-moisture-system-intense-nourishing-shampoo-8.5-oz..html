            <li>LoL!</li>
            <li>recommend using this with the conditioner that matches it because they work together like an ideal team on my hair.</li>
            <li>i hope it works as good!</li>
            <li>Great conditioner.</li>

            <li>Great for scalp.</li>
            <li>Great shampoo.  </li>
            <li>With this trio my hair looks great.</li>
            <li>For a while, I was using the Matrix (orange bottle) and was paying a fortune, and I wasn&#x27;t happy.</li>
            <li>Now I can&#x27;t seem to get my scalp happy again.</li>
            <li>Smells great, cleans well and works as it says it will.  </li>
            <li>have color-treated hair, so I was happy that this was sulfate-free.</li>
            <li>This shampoo felt great in the shower.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the organic ones too which are great.</li>
            <li>the EverCreme would just be great as it was supposed to be for moisture.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The EverStrong worked GREAT, and the smell was AMAZING!</li>
            <li>Feels amazing!  </li>
            <li>This shampoo is one of a kind!</li>
            <li>Smells great too, like warm vanilla sugar.  </li>
            <li>and it takes just a quarter size amount to get a good washing.</li>
            <li>Good.</li>
            <li>Good.</li>
            <li>This shampoo smells soooooo good.</li>
            <li>Good for travel or home.</li>
            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>They always leave my hair feeling silky smooth and smelling great!</li>
            <li>a good detangler&lt;br /&gt;hair feels limper--more tangly&lt;br /&gt;restores</li>
            <li>but she humored me and we both laughed at the disaster it made of my hair - - partway through drying my hair</li>
            <li>and my hair looks as good on day 5 as it did on day 1.  </li>
            <li>Makes your hair smell awesome and feel fantastic.</li>
            <li>product did not smell as good as the EverStrong.</li>
            <li>If shampoo this good can be made vegan for this price all shampoo should be.</li>
            <li>but i hope keep giving me good results....</li>
            <li>Loreal evercreme, everpure and all its product line is extremely good.  </li>
            <li>An excellent product well worth the five stars!</li>
            <li>I love all of L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s sulfate-free lines, and they all smell really great.  </li>
            <li>It cleans nicely without stripping all of the good stuff out of your hair/ scalp, and has nice moisturizing propterties.</li>
            <li>, IT ARRIVED VERY FAST &amp; WAS IN PERFECT CONDITION</li>
            <li>and we both love it!  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>love the product!</li>
            <li>LOVE it!  </li>
            <li>I love the L&#x27;Oreal EverCreme and EverSleek products!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing, it&#x27;s like miracle shampoo.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like a warm brown sugar scent, but better...hard to describe in words.  </li>
            <li>Smells really nice.</li>
            <li>It smells just like warm butter.</li>
            <li>AFTER A MONTH THEY ALL FELT NICE</li>
            <li>and I get comments from my husband of 29 years that my hair smells nice.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo kind of has a wood smoke odor to it.</li>
            <li>Skip the preservatives and keep your mix in the fridge or buy your own propylene glycol (also sold here on Amazon).</li>
            <li>I guess it&#x27;s fine for now - I will use these up until they are gone - but my search for the perfect sulfate free formula that allows my hair to look fabulous is not over.</li>
            <li>The price is right, it smells wonderful, my hair feels clean after using it, but not stripped at ALL</li>
            <li>Smells wonderful, however it doesn&#x27;t do much as far as moisturizing my hair, goes.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft, shiny, and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li>My hair feels good, smooth and shine</li>
            <li>This smells freaking amazing (like cake with fruit or something like that) and it&#x27;s the most concentrated shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>I have fairly damaged hair from bleaching and it managed to smooth it</li>
            <li>My hair shines, soft texture,the smell is wonderful, and the lather from the shampoo moisturizes my skin!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good sulfate free product</li>
            <li>Combined with the right conditioner (I use Aussie Moist), it does a great job.</li>
            <li>However, now I know better.  </li>
            <li>It feels &amp; looks like straw, except I&#x27;m sure straw has more body than my hair.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the smell of this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Overall happy with this and do recommend it!</li>
            <li>As for the product, fantastic!</li>
            <li>I figure with continual use my hair will be even softer &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite shampoo.</li>
            <li>EverCreme Sulfate-Free Moisture System works as well or better.</li>
            <li>Love the way this stuff smells.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love.</li>
            <li>I can feel that it is nourishing my hair because my hair looks more healthy and manageable than before.</li>
            <li>better texture&lt;br /&gt;makes</li>
            <li>and it just adds even more moisture to my hair.</li>
            <li>I also like using the Eversleek Precious Oil Treatment.</li>
            <li>I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I LOVE this series of shampoos and conditioners.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;M IN LOVE WITH THIS PRODUCT AND ITS CONDITIONER....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;M ABSOLUTELY IN LOVE</li>
            <li>ARE ALL KILLING YOUR HAIR OUT BETTER</li>
            <li>This product has no sulfates and the conditioner to it has no silicones, but they work even better than ones I&#x27;ve paid more for.</li>
            <li>Also, I *love</li>
            <li>I personally love the vanilla smell.  </li>
            <li>Love this line.  </li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>The EverCreme products have a lovely fragrance</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much better than any fruity shampoos I&#x27;ve been using.</li>
            <li>it removes dandruff BETTER than Head and Shoulders dandruff-specific shampoo.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it would be okay for a child to use this shampoo</li>
            <li>IN STORE, I WAS SO HAPPY WHEN I FOUND THE WHOLE LINE HERE</li>
            <li>, I HAVE ALREADY ORDERED MORE, WILL ORDER AGAIN.</li>
            <li>You can buy the veg glycerin and oils on your own much more cheaply (all sold here on Amazon).</li>
            <li>love the smell and texture of this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I also love that the Sunday paper sometimes has coupons for L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Evercreme line.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>i love this.</li>
            <li>Love this product and Amazon&#x27;s price.</li>
            <li>my wife loves that it keeps hair better and doresn&#x27;t pull the color from her hair.</li>
            <li>It also rinses out cleanly and without leaving residue, and I feel like it does a good job of getting my hair clean.</li>
            <li>They won&#x27;t strip your color, but still have a nice full foaming effect.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo is another on the long list of products I have tried in my quest for the perfect hair care system.</li>
            <li>This is one of the best shampoos I&#x27;ve used for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Everything was great, just like the last time I had a keratin treatment, and I was loving my hair</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because this isn&#x27;t my favorite out of their sulfate free line.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I was impressed by how soft my hair felt.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t build up, smells great and leaves my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>but I love the rich lather</li>
            <li>but this super nourishing formula is a million times better than the Ever Pure which I loved.  </li>
            <li>I know it supposed to be better for your hair/scalp, but just didn&#x27;t clean as well for me.  </li>
            <li>It washed off as easy as it went in.</li>
            <li>Okay, so this stuff smells wonderful, if you like a heavy scent.</li>
            <li>Having hair that frizzes easily was my motivation to try it</li>
            <li>/&gt;The one good thing is the product smells decent.</li>
            <li>This Loreal shampoo is just OK, nothing special.  </li>
            <li>First of all, let me just say, this shampoo smells AMAZING.</li>
            <li>this shampoo its very good for dry hair like mine.</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE this brand and this particular product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay to use from time to time and the smell is pleasant enough.</li>
            <li>Smooth and fragrant after use.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that they&#x27;re sulfate free.</li>
            <li>The smell is fresh and the silkiness is fantastic!</li>
            <li>i liked it so much today</li>
            <li>This shampoo along with the conditioner makes my hair silky smooth and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I decided to try this product after trying a sample of the EverSleek sulfate free shampoo.</li>
            <li>, It&#x27;s available on the ground.</li>
            <li>This is a great product- it lathers very well and has a decent smell.</li>
            <li>It bubbled up okay (not as many bubbles as sulfate shampoo, but there was a decent lather), and my hair didn&#x27;t feel \\&quot;squeaky\\&quot; and overstripped after I rinsed.</li>
            <li>This Loreal shampoo is one of the first sulfate free shampoos I tried and for lack of a better alternative, I used it for quite some time.  </li>
            <li>I love to flat-iron my hair because I love the super straight look, and my hair almost looks like it&#x27;s been flat-ironed.</li>
            <li>i am happy i did it left my hair super shiny</li>
            <li>but I am on day 3 and my hair looks even better than on the first day.</li>
            <li>My hair is so soft and smooth, and I love that it&#x27;s sulfate free!</li>
            <li>Thanks L&#x27;oreal! :)</li>
            <li>But if you have coarse or thick hair, I think this shampoo is perfect, and at a great price.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try it</li>
            <li>It did feel clean though.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten a few compliments on how good it smells, but I can&#x27;t justify buying these products just because it makes my hair smell nice.</li>
            <li>Great price on Amazon and a great purchase if you need to spend a few extra bucks for free shipping.</li>
            <li>If you read any of my other reviews, I love products that smell good.</li>
            <li>And I was RIGHT!</li>
            <li>it smells sweet and nice, and it leaves my hair soft.</li>
            <li>that being said, I&#x27;ve also tried the intense nourshing shampoo and had better luck with that one.</li>
            <li>I cannot say enough good things about this product.</li>
            <li>I have loved all of the L&#x27;Oreal Ever--- products that I have tried, and this was simply my next to try.</li>
            <li>Double good.</li>
            <li>I love the Intense conditioner, though.  </li>
            <li>but it is true)</li>
            <li>Will definitely order again and recommend it to others looking for a good shampoo without sulphates.</li>
            <li>For the first time, I can easily go the 4 - 5 days between shampoos which is all curly/wavy hair needs</li>
            <li>seriously the best shampoo/conditioner I have found.</li>
            <li>This particular line from Loreal is the one packed with the most nourishing.</li>
            <li>(if I was lucky).  </li>
            <li>But if you really do like it, be happy, because it&#x27;s gonna last you</li>
            <li>One by one, my hairdresser has tried every single brand of shampoo &amp; conditioner her salon sells and we never found 1 that really \\&quot;worked\\&quot; since, in my book, I have to be able to get good results when I take care of my hair between the 3 week touch-ups.  </li>
            <li>I liked this one more than the other in this L&#x27;oreal series.</li>
            <li>this is pretty much the best shampoo I have used in my entire live!</li>
            <li>After the shower, it was very soft and smelled fantastic!</li>
            <li>my hair dreser washed my hair and i felt my hair soft, not dry, and also have great smell, like vanilla.</li>
            <li>Either way they are both loaded with far more chemicals</li>
            <li>I love the lather and my hair feels soft and bouncy.</li>
            <li>Honestly I can&#x27;t believe how damaging it turned out to be with simply one use!</li>
            <li>WHO IS TIRED OF COMPANIES CLAIMING TO HAVE THE BEST PRODUCT</li>
            <li>After using L&#x27;Oreal, my hair feels so soft and looks healthy and shiny.  </li>
            <li>It does a good job of lathering and that&#x27;s a plus, but it&#x27;s not what I had expected.</li>
            <li>My hair was so soft after washing with it, I was SURE</li>
            <li>highly recommend this to those with dry hair looking for a great moisturizing shampoo.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the other shampoo in this line (L&#x27;Oreal Hydrate EverStrong) with good results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Decided to try EverCreme...</li>
            <li>it is just right.</li>
            <li>Hair and scalp both feeling just right.</li>
            <li>information should be MORE CLEAR in the first descriptions.</li>
            <li>To me it smells like some cross between really cheap perfume and a strong hair dye solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>bought this on a whim i normally use a high priced cleansing conditioner i love it</li>
            <li>Love this smell to this shampoo and it really does make your hair feel soft and smoother.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like this shampoo very much.  </li>
            <li>THANK YOU VERY MUCH</li>
            <li>I use more than half the amount of other leading shampoo&#x27;s thus is saves me a ton of money and smells great.</li>
            <li>For the first time since I was a child I liked how my hair looked every single time - - even when I washed it myself at home and blew it dry, I got the same great results.  </li>
            <li>Sure enough, there were people shouting out their experiences trying to let others know the damage this shampoo does to your hair.  </li>
            <li>I ignored it at first because I was rather stressed at the time.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe my hair was soft and tangle free with shampoo alone.</li>
            <li>I have extremely coarse hair and discovered their sleek line is better for me.</li>
            <li>the first time.i did buy the nourishing conditioner to use with it</li>
            <li>but when I use this shampoo/conditioner with the mask, its so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo, I recently switched over from Dove moisturizing shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>This shampoo (not to sound like a commercial) makes my hair so soft and healthy.</li>
            <li>AT FIRST</li>
            <li>It has been consistently dyed every 3 weeks for 22 years.  </li>
            <li>When the Ever Creme Intensive line came out I was the first on line.  </li>
            <li>glides from scalp to ends like a hot knife through butter.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s sulfate free and has no harsh ingredients.</li>
            <li>Ok, I initially bought this shampoo because I&#x27;m trying anything to get my psoriasis under control.  </li>
            <li>This is the first sulfate-free shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>It cleans my scalp pretty well.</li>
            <li>my hair with conditioner because even though the rest of my hair is clean the hair from my shoulders down is dry and fly away.  </li>
            <li>Used my old tried and true yesterday and my hair was exactly the texture it used to be with no straw texture.  </li>
            <li>My hair is curly and dry, this really moisturizes it and helps tame the fly aways...as well as softens them!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve always had positive effects.</li>
            <li>But, this one is my all-time favorite, and will be a staple for me as long as it&#x27;s on the store shelves.</li>
            <li>I guess it pretty much does</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s kind of itchy, weighs hair down, and yet leaves it crispy and parched.  </li>
            <li>My hair might have been a little more moisturized, but my scalp went haywire!</li>
            <li>and my hair has never been more dry.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t dry out your hair for sure.</li>
            <li>So if you&#x27;re the type who dislikes hair products with strong smells, I don&#x27;t recommend trying anything from the EverCreme line because they all have the same perfume type scent.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is EXTREMELY strong, so if you&#x27;re sensitive to fragrance, steer clear.  </li>
            <li>I have tried other of the \\&quot;Loreal Ever-____\\&quot; line and they had worked great on my curly hair, which is slightly dry and of medium volume.</li>
            <li>I used this along with the conditioner from the same product line and my hair felt amazing the next day.</li>
            <li>Intense Nourishing..</li>
            <li>She said it makes her hair much softer and easier to work with.  </li>
            <li>I also used another Evercreme called cleansing conditioner and it just didn&#x27;t work as well for me, it doesn&#x27;t suds up at all, so I had to use twice as much as this one, which</li>
            <li>Much like how others describe it here.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend you buying it!</li>
            <li>Very disappointing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like this shampoo, its very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>They work really well</li>
            <li>really it works</li>
            <li>with this shampoo and conditioner from L&#x27;Oreal, my hair does not frizz up as much as before and my Keratin  hair treatment lasts longer.</li>
            <li>INTENSE NOURISHING SHAMPOO AND CONDITIONER HAVE MADE SO MUCH DIFFERENCE</li>
            <li>I bought the intense nourishing shampoo, conditioner, leave in spray and hair mask</li>
            <li>Despite how much you rinse, this product leaves a residue in the hair.</li>
            <li>I think the manufacturer put too much conditioner in it.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is gentle on color treated hair.</li>
            <li>and it really lathers up.</li>
            <li>Despite being sulfate-free, it lathers really well.</li>
            <li>So, currently, I&#x27;m trying the sulfate free stuff.  </li>
            <li>and I was happily surprised that it controls the frizzes and left my hair more manageable</li>
            <li>However, one day I was completely out and my local Walmart no longer had that particular one stocked, so I decided to used the \\&quot;EverCreme Intense Nourishing\\&quot; shampoo and conditioner, thinking that it may actually be better for my curls!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Right 4A hair soft?</li>
            <li>When used with the conditioner your hair comes out full and soft, cleaner than your old shampoo!</li>
            <li>So if you have fine, thinner hair, then it will most likely weigh your hair down, and even might make it on the greasy side.</li>
            <li>I used this with the conditioner, and I could tell during the shower my hair was more moisturized than with other shampoos.</li>
            <li>they last weeks since they are so rich.</li>
            <li>I did not find this EverCreme product to be anything other than OK.  </li>
            <li>I much prefer Shea Moisture shampoo/conditioner and the Manuka Honey formula in particular.  </li>
            <li>is quite sufficient to clean any products off the fragile split-end prone length of your hair.  </li>
            <li>I also only used this as a every-other-day shampoo because my hair did not feel 100% clean after using it.</li>
            <li>I use it and it leaves my hair soft,  had a light scent that&#x27;s nice, and doesn&#x27;t weigh my fine,  yet thick hair down.</li>
            <li>She mentioned it can be difficult to find in local stores, so she was happy to see it available on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t buy shampoos over the counter, but I really like this one.</li>
            <li>(You can see the full ingredients list by zooming in on the second product image.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>my hair is soft and easy to flat iron after using this.</li>
            <li>It is a decent product, though, I like that it is sulfate-free.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many brands from drugstores and salons, and this isn&#x27;t the worst, but it isn&#x27;t the best either.</li>
            <li>I keep changing my shampoo, so I love that the size is not too big and the price is low, probably because of the size.</li>
            <li>highly recommend</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hooked, highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>I have super thick curly frizzy hair and this is the only kind that doesn&#x27;t make it go haywire.</li>
            <li>Used it last night &amp; got on to request a refund first thing this morning!</li>
            <li>It cleansed nicely without bring over drying and didn&#x27;t tangle my hair nor make it hard.</li>
            <li>They leave my hair soft, supple and shiny and feeling very nourished.  </li>
            <li>and the price is very affordable compared to professional line shampoos.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still looking for that one shampoo that will make my color-treated hair feel normal.</li>
            <li>My hair type is normal, but I tend to color, and curl my hair, add a bit of add products for oomph</li>
            <li>The regular shampoo in this line is worth its weight in gold for what it has done for my hair.  </li>
            <li>I much preferred everpure smooth shampoo that made my hair silky without weighing it down</li>
            <li>, California gets very hot and we frequently have very high winds - - either of which can make long and/or curly wavy hair a nightmare.  </li>
            <li>Specially for frizzy and dry hair.  </li>
            <li>This keeps my color lasting longer, my hair super soft and it leaves no build up.  </li>
            <li>This leaves my dry processed hair silky smooth, soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>I have used other products that are low or non sudsing or no poo, and this one is a good middle of the road one.  </li>
            <li>chose L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Evercreme mainly because it was the first brand with a sulfate-free offering that I could find in my local stores.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just a little bit lathers up to wash your scalp (which all an honest hairdresser will tell you is THE ONLY PART OF YOUR HAIR that needs to be washed.  </li>
            <li>and I feel like I have new hair.</li>
            <li>I tried this new one</li>
            <li>&amp; it seriously smells amazing.</li>
            <li>I have super dry hair that is also color treated.  </li>
            <li>Its difficult to find sulfate free products at the drugstore and this one is definitely my favorite.  </li>
            <li>My hair is naturally curly, fine hair but after the Japanese treatment, it has not been the same.</li>
            <li>This made my hair so soft!</li>
            <li>My keratin hair treatment has lasted for more than four months when it usually lasts 2 to 3 months.</li>
            <li>AND IT HAS BEEN THE FIRST AND ONLY TIME</li>
            <li>Sulfate free so less damaging to your hair</li>
            <li>: You know how the first time you use a product your hair seems to love it up, then the next few times the results are only so-so?</li>
            <li>But after my hair dries, it seems as though its pretty much under control (which hasn&#x27;t happened with other shampoos).  </li>
            <li>What was wrong with the good old bottle!</li>
            <li>The minute L&#x27;Oreal Ever Pure Moisturizing shampoo and conditioner for colored hair hit the stores I bought it and took it to my next hair appointment.  Alleluia !  </li>
            <li>The only thing is I wish I could find it in a large bottle.</li>
            <li>Sometimes sulfate free products produce little lather</li>
            <li>I eventually used a different shampoo with the EverCreme conditioner and my hair felt normal afterward, so I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that my hair just doesn&#x27;t like this particular shampoo.</li>
            <li>If the weather is especially humid, I apply a little L&#x27;Oreal EverSleek Precious Oil Treatment to my hair before I style it.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t leave my hair soft and feeling moisturized at all.  </li>
            <li>My hair&#x27;s color treated and although this shampoo is sulfate free, it seemed rather harsh.  </li>
            <li>Lee&#x27;s hair silky soft.</li>
            <li>Use it for both me and my 9 yr old daughter</li>
            <li>I like the way it leaves my 4A hair soft (without conditioner).</li>
            <li>Shiny soft hair.</li>
            <li>hair really soft--</li>
            <li>natural oils</li>
            <li>I had a Brazilian keratin treatment that made my hair so soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>They make my hair feel luxuriously soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>Bought for my daughter who can&#x27;t find the product near where she lives.  </li>
            <li>No dried out ends which results in tangled or snarled curls.  </li>
            <li>Just soft SHINY SHINY SHINY wavy/curly hair that looks like I just walked out of the beauty shop.  </li>
            <li>My naturally curly silver hair has always been unmanageable in humid climates until I started using this shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>My hair is not dyed but this shampoo makes my hair soft as well, and (this isn&#x27;t advertised on the product</li>
            <li>Leaves my color-treated hair soft.</li>
            <li>(So far I&#x27;m on month 2</li>
            <li>As far as I can see I&#x27;m done looking for my holy grail shampoo.</li>
            <li>what it&#x27;s worth, I did use a detangling spray after getting out of the shower, but while my hair was still wet.</li>
            <li>Even the expensive stuff (like Morrocanoil) doesn&#x27;t do as good a job.</li>
            <li>I have spent a LOT more on other products and this is the one I will be sticking with.</li>
            <li>I bought this from my local drug store and was a little hesitant because of the price (higher than listed here on Amazon), but I convinced myself it would be worth it.</li>
            <li>You need just a little to clean your hair with the shampoo.</li>
            <li>It was really one of the more dramatic overnight differences I&#x27;ve noticed.</li>
            <li>After noticing the change in my hair, I switched back to my old tried-and-true Pantene shampoo and my hair seemed to return to normal.</li>
            <li>My daughter had better luck, maybe it&#x27;s just not good for my hair</li>
            <li>USED to have gorgeous dark healthy hair :(</li>
            <li>It takes my hairdresser about 45 minutes to blow it dry in an effort to try to tame the curl, because there are so many sections upon sections to all my hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair is long, fine, slightly wavy, and damaged.</li>
            <li>my hair is very processed and dry</li>
            <li>but it really is supposed to nourish hair and repair damaged or dry hair that is repeatedly heated or dyed.</li>
            <li>I agree with the handful of other reviewers who said they liked the other L&#x27;Oreal Ever products, but this one left my hair dry, crunchy, and straw like.</li>
            <li>the line sulfate free of loreal is too much good,but i prefer result of loreal ever pure because this is a few difficult out of my hair,but result is very shine</li>
            <li>I used Enjoy, and Nexxus in the past - I always keep coming back to L&#x27;oreal.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this for people with my hair, which is soft and curly.</li>
            <li>I could barely run my fingers through my hair w/o it getting tangled.</li>
            <li>After reading a ton of natural hair blogs, they all seem to say the same thing:</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND to those with dry or colored hair.</li>
            <li>Years ago, there were few sulfate free shampoos on the market (just a few high end brands).  </li>
            <li>Older male using, that has shoulder legnth hair and 4&amp;#34; long beard.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thick, creamy and produces a rich lather.</li>
            <li>It may be sulfate free but has a lot of other chemicals some of which when I looked them up state they can dry out your hair and cause frizz - that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m trying to fix, my dry and frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>My biggest complaint - my hair &amp; scalp do not feel clean.</li>
            <li>Likewise, a little bit of conditioner squishedthrough your clean hair and a wide tooth comb</li>
            <li>Leaves too much residue on hair, weighs it down and gave me dandruff.</li>
            <li>I have thick wavy long hair and have tried so many shampoos over the years even 5x as much as this one but never satisfied.</li>
            <li>but that is not necessary with every use i have super thick curly shoulder length hair that i color every 5 wks</li>
            <li>(pay be good or bad)</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Great shampoo.  </li>
            <li> With this trio my hair looks great.</li>
            <li> For a while, I was using the Matrix (orange bottle) and was paying a fortune, and I wasn&#x27;t happy.</li>
            <li> Now I can&#x27;t seem to get my scalp happy again.</li>
            <li> Smells great, cleans well and works as it says it will.  </li>
            <li> have color-treated hair, so I was happy that this was sulfate-free.</li>
            <li> This shampoo felt great in the shower.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the organic ones too which are great.</li>
            <li> the EverCreme would just be great as it was supposed to be for moisture.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The EverStrong worked GREAT, and the smell was AMAZING!</li>
            <li> Feels amazing!  </li>

            <li> and it takes just a quarter size amount to get a good washing.</li>
            <li> Good.</li>

            <li> Good stuff.</li>
            <li> They always leave my hair feeling silky smooth and smelling great!</li>
            <li> a good detangler&lt;br /&gt;hair feels limper--more tangly&lt;br /&gt;restores</li>
            <li> but she humored me and we both laughed at the disaster it made of my hair - - partway through drying my hair</li>
            <li> and my hair looks as good on day 5 as it did on day 1.  </li>
            <li> Makes your hair smell awesome and feel fantastic.</li>
            <li> product did not smell as good as the EverStrong.</li>
            <li> If shampoo this good can be made vegan for this price all shampoo should be.</li>
            <li> but i hope keep giving me good results....</li>
            <li> Loreal evercreme, everpure and all its product line is extremely good.  </li>
            <li> An excellent product well worth the five stars!</li>
            <li> I love all of L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s sulfate-free lines, and they all smell really great.  </li>
            <li> It cleans nicely without stripping all of the good stuff out of your hair/ scalp, and has nice moisturizing propterties.</li>
            <li> , IT ARRIVED VERY FAST &amp; WAS IN PERFECT CONDITION</li>
            <li> and we both love it!  </li>
            <li> I love it!</li>

            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing, it&#x27;s like miracle shampoo.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a warm brown sugar scent, but better...hard to describe in words.  </li>
            <li> Smells really nice.</li>
            <li> It smells just like warm butter.</li>
            <li> AFTER A MONTH THEY ALL FELT NICE</li>
            <li> and I get comments from my husband of 29 years that my hair smells nice.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo kind of has a wood smoke odor to it.</li>
            <li> Skip the preservatives and keep your mix in the fridge or buy your own propylene glycol (also sold here on Amazon).</li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s fine for now - I will use these up until they are gone - but my search for the perfect sulfate free formula that allows my hair to look fabulous is not over.</li>
            <li> The price is right, it smells wonderful, my hair feels clean after using it, but not stripped at ALL</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful, however it doesn&#x27;t do much as far as moisturizing my hair, goes.</li>
            <li> My hair is soft, shiny, and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> My hair feels good, smooth and shine</li>
            <li> This smells freaking amazing (like cake with fruit or something like that) and it&#x27;s the most concentrated shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I have fairly damaged hair from bleaching and it managed to smooth it</li>
            <li> My hair shines, soft texture,the smell is wonderful, and the lather from the shampoo moisturizes my skin!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good sulfate free product</li>
            <li> Combined with the right conditioner (I use Aussie Moist), it does a great job.</li>
            <li> However, now I know better.  </li>
            <li> It feels &amp; looks like straw, except I&#x27;m sure straw has more body than my hair.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the smell of this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Overall happy with this and do recommend it!</li>
            <li> As for the product, fantastic!</li>
            <li> I figure with continual use my hair will be even softer &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite shampoo.</li>
            <li> EverCreme Sulfate-Free Moisture System works as well or better.</li>

            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love.</li>
            <li> I can feel that it is nourishing my hair because my hair looks more healthy and manageable than before.</li>
            <li> better texture&lt;br /&gt;makes</li>
            <li> and it just adds even more moisture to my hair.</li>
            <li> I also like using the Eversleek Precious Oil Treatment.</li>
            <li> I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I LOVE this series of shampoos and conditioners.</li>

            <li> ARE ALL KILLING YOUR HAIR OUT BETTER</li>
            <li> This product has no sulfates and the conditioner to it has no silicones, but they work even better than ones I&#x27;ve paid more for.</li>
            <li> Also, I *love</li>
            <li> I personally love the vanilla smell.  </li>
            <li> Love this line.  </li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li> The EverCreme products have a lovely fragrance</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much better than any fruity shampoos I&#x27;ve been using.</li>
            <li> it removes dandruff BETTER than Head and Shoulders dandruff-specific shampoo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it would be okay for a child to use this shampoo</li>
            <li> IN STORE, I WAS SO HAPPY WHEN I FOUND THE WHOLE LINE HERE</li>
            <li> , I HAVE ALREADY ORDERED MORE, WILL ORDER AGAIN.</li>
            <li> You can buy the veg glycerin and oils on your own much more cheaply (all sold here on Amazon).</li>
            <li> love the smell and texture of this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I also love that the Sunday paper sometimes has coupons for L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Evercreme line.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> i love this.</li>
            <li> Love this product and Amazon&#x27;s price.</li>
            <li> my wife loves that it keeps hair better and doresn&#x27;t pull the color from her hair.</li>
            <li> It also rinses out cleanly and without leaving residue, and I feel like it does a good job of getting my hair clean.</li>
            <li> They won&#x27;t strip your color, but still have a nice full foaming effect.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo is another on the long list of products I have tried in my quest for the perfect hair care system.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best shampoos I&#x27;ve used for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Everything was great, just like the last time I had a keratin treatment, and I was loving my hair</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because this isn&#x27;t my favorite out of their sulfate free line.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I was impressed by how soft my hair felt.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t build up, smells great and leaves my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> but I love the rich lather</li>
            <li> but this super nourishing formula is a million times better than the Ever Pure which I loved.  </li>
            <li> I know it supposed to be better for your hair/scalp, but just didn&#x27;t clean as well for me.  </li>
            <li> It washed off as easy as it went in.</li>
            <li> Okay, so this stuff smells wonderful, if you like a heavy scent.</li>
            <li> Having hair that frizzes easily was my motivation to try it</li>
            <li> /&gt;The one good thing is the product smells decent.</li>
            <li> This Loreal shampoo is just OK, nothing special.  </li>
            <li> First of all, let me just say, this shampoo smells AMAZING.</li>
            <li> this shampoo its very good for dry hair like mine.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this brand and this particular product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay to use from time to time and the smell is pleasant enough.</li>
            <li> Smooth and fragrant after use.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that they&#x27;re sulfate free.</li>
            <li> The smell is fresh and the silkiness is fantastic!</li>
            <li> i liked it so much today</li>
            <li> This shampoo along with the conditioner makes my hair silky smooth and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I decided to try this product after trying a sample of the EverSleek sulfate free shampoo.</li>
            <li> , It&#x27;s available on the ground.</li>
            <li> This is a great product- it lathers very well and has a decent smell.</li>
            <li> It bubbled up okay (not as many bubbles as sulfate shampoo, but there was a decent lather), and my hair didn&#x27;t feel \\&quot;squeaky\\&quot; and overstripped after I rinsed.</li>
            <li> This Loreal shampoo is one of the first sulfate free shampoos I tried and for lack of a better alternative, I used it for quite some time.  </li>
            <li> I love to flat-iron my hair because I love the super straight look, and my hair almost looks like it&#x27;s been flat-ironed.</li>
            <li> i am happy i did it left my hair super shiny</li>
            <li> but I am on day 3 and my hair looks even better than on the first day.</li>
            <li> My hair is so soft and smooth, and I love that it&#x27;s sulfate free!</li>
            <li> Thanks L&#x27;oreal! :)</li>
            <li> But if you have coarse or thick hair, I think this shampoo is perfect, and at a great price.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try it</li>
            <li> It did feel clean though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten a few compliments on how good it smells, but I can&#x27;t justify buying these products just because it makes my hair smell nice.</li>
            <li> Great price on Amazon and a great purchase if you need to spend a few extra bucks for free shipping.</li>
            <li> If you read any of my other reviews, I love products that smell good.</li>
            <li> And I was RIGHT!</li>
            <li> it smells sweet and nice, and it leaves my hair soft.</li>
            <li> that being said, I&#x27;ve also tried the intense nourshing shampoo and had better luck with that one.</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough good things about this product.</li>
            <li> I have loved all of the L&#x27;Oreal Ever--- products that I have tried, and this was simply my next to try.</li>
            <li> Double good.</li>
            <li> I love the Intense conditioner, though.  </li>
            <li> but it is true)</li>
            <li> Will definitely order again and recommend it to others looking for a good shampoo without sulphates.</li>
            <li> For the first time, I can easily go the 4 - 5 days between shampoos which is all curly/wavy hair needs</li>
            <li> seriously the best shampoo/conditioner I have found.</li>
            <li> This particular line from Loreal is the one packed with the most nourishing.</li>
            <li> (if I was lucky).  </li>
            <li> But if you really do like it, be happy, because it&#x27;s gonna last you</li>
            <li> One by one, my hairdresser has tried every single brand of shampoo &amp; conditioner her salon sells and we never found 1 that really \\&quot;worked\\&quot; since, in my book, I have to be able to get good results when I take care of my hair between the 3 week touch-ups.  </li>
            <li> I liked this one more than the other in this L&#x27;oreal series.</li>
            <li> this is pretty much the best shampoo I have used in my entire live!</li>
            <li> After the shower, it was very soft and smelled fantastic!</li>
            <li> my hair dreser washed my hair and i felt my hair soft, not dry, and also have great smell, like vanilla.</li>
            <li> Either way they are both loaded with far more chemicals</li>
            <li> I love the lather and my hair feels soft and bouncy.</li>
            <li> Honestly I can&#x27;t believe how damaging it turned out to be with simply one use!</li>
            <li> WHO IS TIRED OF COMPANIES CLAIMING TO HAVE THE BEST PRODUCT</li>
            <li> After using L&#x27;Oreal, my hair feels so soft and looks healthy and shiny.  </li>
            <li> It does a good job of lathering and that&#x27;s a plus, but it&#x27;s not what I had expected.</li>
            <li> My hair was so soft after washing with it, I was SURE</li>
            <li> highly recommend this to those with dry hair looking for a great moisturizing shampoo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the other shampoo in this line (L&#x27;Oreal Hydrate EverStrong) with good results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Decided to try EverCreme...</li>
            <li> it is just right.</li>
            <li> Hair and scalp both feeling just right.</li>
            <li> information should be MORE CLEAR in the first descriptions.</li>
            <li> To me it smells like some cross between really cheap perfume and a strong hair dye solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> bought this on a whim i normally use a high priced cleansing conditioner i love it</li>
            <li> Love this smell to this shampoo and it really does make your hair feel soft and smoother.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this shampoo very much.  </li>
            <li> THANK YOU VERY MUCH</li>
            <li> I use more than half the amount of other leading shampoo&#x27;s thus is saves me a ton of money and smells great.</li>
            <li> For the first time since I was a child I liked how my hair looked every single time - - even when I washed it myself at home and blew it dry, I got the same great results.  </li>
            <li> Sure enough, there were people shouting out their experiences trying to let others know the damage this shampoo does to your hair.  </li>
            <li> I ignored it at first because I was rather stressed at the time.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe my hair was soft and tangle free with shampoo alone.</li>
            <li> I have extremely coarse hair and discovered their sleek line is better for me.</li>
            <li> the first time.i did buy the nourishing conditioner to use with it</li>
            <li> but when I use this shampoo/conditioner with the mask, its so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo, I recently switched over from Dove moisturizing shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> This shampoo (not to sound like a commercial) makes my hair so soft and healthy.</li>
            <li> AT FIRST</li>
            <li> It has been consistently dyed every 3 weeks for 22 years.  </li>
            <li> When the Ever Creme Intensive line came out I was the first on line.  </li>
            <li> glides from scalp to ends like a hot knife through butter.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s sulfate free and has no harsh ingredients.</li>
            <li> Ok, I initially bought this shampoo because I&#x27;m trying anything to get my psoriasis under control.  </li>
            <li> This is the first sulfate-free shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> It cleans my scalp pretty well.</li>
            <li> my hair with conditioner because even though the rest of my hair is clean the hair from my shoulders down is dry and fly away.  </li>
            <li> Used my old tried and true yesterday and my hair was exactly the texture it used to be with no straw texture.  </li>
            <li> My hair is curly and dry, this really moisturizes it and helps tame the fly aways...as well as softens them!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve always had positive effects.</li>
            <li> But, this one is my all-time favorite, and will be a staple for me as long as it&#x27;s on the store shelves.</li>
            <li> I guess it pretty much does</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s kind of itchy, weighs hair down, and yet leaves it crispy and parched.  </li>
            <li> My hair might have been a little more moisturized, but my scalp went haywire!</li>
            <li> and my hair has never been more dry.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t dry out your hair for sure.</li>
            <li> So if you&#x27;re the type who dislikes hair products with strong smells, I don&#x27;t recommend trying anything from the EverCreme line because they all have the same perfume type scent.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is EXTREMELY strong, so if you&#x27;re sensitive to fragrance, steer clear.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other of the \\&quot;Loreal Ever-____\\&quot; line and they had worked great on my curly hair, which is slightly dry and of medium volume.</li>
            <li> I used this along with the conditioner from the same product line and my hair felt amazing the next day.</li>
            <li> Intense Nourishing..</li>
            <li> She said it makes her hair much softer and easier to work with.  </li>
            <li> I also used another Evercreme called cleansing conditioner and it just didn&#x27;t work as well for me, it doesn&#x27;t suds up at all, so I had to use twice as much as this one, which</li>
            <li> Much like how others describe it here.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend you buying it!</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like this shampoo, its very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> They work really well</li>
            <li> really it works</li>
            <li> with this shampoo and conditioner from L&#x27;Oreal, my hair does not frizz up as much as before and my Keratin  hair treatment lasts longer.</li>
            <li> INTENSE NOURISHING SHAMPOO AND CONDITIONER HAVE MADE SO MUCH DIFFERENCE</li>
            <li> I bought the intense nourishing shampoo, conditioner, leave in spray and hair mask</li>
            <li> Despite how much you rinse, this product leaves a residue in the hair.</li>
            <li> I think the manufacturer put too much conditioner in it.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is gentle on color treated hair.</li>
            <li> and it really lathers up.</li>
            <li> Despite being sulfate-free, it lathers really well.</li>
            <li> So, currently, I&#x27;m trying the sulfate free stuff.  </li>
            <li> and I was happily surprised that it controls the frizzes and left my hair more manageable</li>
            <li> However, one day I was completely out and my local Walmart no longer had that particular one stocked, so I decided to used the \\&quot;EverCreme Intense Nourishing\\&quot; shampoo and conditioner, thinking that it may actually be better for my curls!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Right 4A hair soft?</li>
            <li> When used with the conditioner your hair comes out full and soft, cleaner than your old shampoo!</li>
            <li> So if you have fine, thinner hair, then it will most likely weigh your hair down, and even might make it on the greasy side.</li>
            <li> I used this with the conditioner, and I could tell during the shower my hair was more moisturized than with other shampoos.</li>
            <li> they last weeks since they are so rich.</li>
            <li> I did not find this EverCreme product to be anything other than OK.  </li>
            <li> I much prefer Shea Moisture shampoo/conditioner and the Manuka Honey formula in particular.  </li>
            <li> is quite sufficient to clean any products off the fragile split-end prone length of your hair.  </li>
            <li> I also only used this as a every-other-day shampoo because my hair did not feel 100% clean after using it.</li>
            <li> I use it and it leaves my hair soft,  had a light scent that&#x27;s nice, and doesn&#x27;t weigh my fine,  yet thick hair down.</li>
            <li> She mentioned it can be difficult to find in local stores, so she was happy to see it available on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t buy shampoos over the counter, but I really like this one.</li>
            <li> (You can see the full ingredients list by zooming in on the second product image.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> my hair is soft and easy to flat iron after using this.</li>
            <li> It is a decent product, though, I like that it is sulfate-free.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many brands from drugstores and salons, and this isn&#x27;t the worst, but it isn&#x27;t the best either.</li>
            <li> I keep changing my shampoo, so I love that the size is not too big and the price is low, probably because of the size.</li>
            <li> highly recommend</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hooked, highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I have super thick curly frizzy hair and this is the only kind that doesn&#x27;t make it go haywire.</li>
            <li> Used it last night &amp; got on to request a refund first thing this morning!</li>
            <li> It cleansed nicely without bring over drying and didn&#x27;t tangle my hair nor make it hard.</li>
            <li> They leave my hair soft, supple and shiny and feeling very nourished.  </li>
            <li> and the price is very affordable compared to professional line shampoos.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still looking for that one shampoo that will make my color-treated hair feel normal.</li>
            <li> My hair type is normal, but I tend to color, and curl my hair, add a bit of add products for oomph</li>
            <li> The regular shampoo in this line is worth its weight in gold for what it has done for my hair.  </li>
            <li> I much preferred everpure smooth shampoo that made my hair silky without weighing it down</li>
            <li> , California gets very hot and we frequently have very high winds - - either of which can make long and/or curly wavy hair a nightmare.  </li>
            <li> Specially for frizzy and dry hair.  </li>
            <li> This keeps my color lasting longer, my hair super soft and it leaves no build up.  </li>
            <li> This leaves my dry processed hair silky smooth, soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I have used other products that are low or non sudsing or no poo, and this one is a good middle of the road one.  </li>
            <li> chose L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Evercreme mainly because it was the first brand with a sulfate-free offering that I could find in my local stores.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just a little bit lathers up to wash your scalp (which all an honest hairdresser will tell you is THE ONLY PART OF YOUR HAIR that needs to be washed.  </li>
            <li> and I feel like I have new hair.</li>
            <li> I tried this new one</li>
            <li> &amp; it seriously smells amazing.</li>
            <li> I have super dry hair that is also color treated.  </li>
            <li> Its difficult to find sulfate free products at the drugstore and this one is definitely my favorite.  </li>
            <li> My hair is naturally curly, fine hair but after the Japanese treatment, it has not been the same.</li>
            <li> This made my hair so soft!</li>
            <li> My keratin hair treatment has lasted for more than four months when it usually lasts 2 to 3 months.</li>
            <li> AND IT HAS BEEN THE FIRST AND ONLY TIME</li>
            <li> Sulfate free so less damaging to your hair</li>
            <li> : You know how the first time you use a product your hair seems to love it up, then the next few times the results are only so-so?</li>
            <li> But after my hair dries, it seems as though its pretty much under control (which hasn&#x27;t happened with other shampoos).  </li>
            <li> What was wrong with the good old bottle!</li>
            <li> The minute L&#x27;Oreal Ever Pure Moisturizing shampoo and conditioner for colored hair hit the stores I bought it and took it to my next hair appointment.  Alleluia !  </li>
            <li> The only thing is I wish I could find it in a large bottle.</li>
            <li> Sometimes sulfate free products produce little lather</li>
            <li> I eventually used a different shampoo with the EverCreme conditioner and my hair felt normal afterward, so I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that my hair just doesn&#x27;t like this particular shampoo.</li>
            <li> If the weather is especially humid, I apply a little L&#x27;Oreal EverSleek Precious Oil Treatment to my hair before I style it.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t leave my hair soft and feeling moisturized at all.  </li>
            <li> My hair&#x27;s color treated and although this shampoo is sulfate free, it seemed rather harsh.  </li>
            <li> Lee&#x27;s hair silky soft.</li>
            <li> Use it for both me and my 9 yr old daughter</li>
            <li> I like the way it leaves my 4A hair soft (without conditioner).</li>
            <li> Shiny soft hair.</li>
            <li> hair really soft--</li>
            <li> natural oils</li>
            <li> I had a Brazilian keratin treatment that made my hair so soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li> They make my hair feel luxuriously soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Bought for my daughter who can&#x27;t find the product near where she lives.  </li>
            <li> No dried out ends which results in tangled or snarled curls.  </li>
            <li> Just soft SHINY SHINY SHINY wavy/curly hair that looks like I just walked out of the beauty shop.  </li>
            <li> My naturally curly silver hair has always been unmanageable in humid climates until I started using this shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> My hair is not dyed but this shampoo makes my hair soft as well, and (this isn&#x27;t advertised on the product</li>
            <li> Leaves my color-treated hair soft.</li>
            <li> (So far I&#x27;m on month 2</li>
            <li> As far as I can see I&#x27;m done looking for my holy grail shampoo.</li>
            <li> what it&#x27;s worth, I did use a detangling spray after getting out of the shower, but while my hair was still wet.</li>
            <li> Even the expensive stuff (like Morrocanoil) doesn&#x27;t do as good a job.</li>
            <li> I have spent a LOT more on other products and this is the one I will be sticking with.</li>
            <li> I bought this from my local drug store and was a little hesitant because of the price (higher than listed here on Amazon), but I convinced myself it would be worth it.</li>
            <li> You need just a little to clean your hair with the shampoo.</li>
            <li> It was really one of the more dramatic overnight differences I&#x27;ve noticed.</li>
            <li> After noticing the change in my hair, I switched back to my old tried-and-true Pantene shampoo and my hair seemed to return to normal.</li>
            <li> My daughter had better luck, maybe it&#x27;s just not good for my hair</li>
            <li> USED to have gorgeous dark healthy hair :(</li>
            <li> It takes my hairdresser about 45 minutes to blow it dry in an effort to try to tame the curl, because there are so many sections upon sections to all my hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair is long, fine, slightly wavy, and damaged.</li>
            <li> my hair is very processed and dry</li>
            <li> but it really is supposed to nourish hair and repair damaged or dry hair that is repeatedly heated or dyed.</li>
            <li> I agree with the handful of other reviewers who said they liked the other L&#x27;Oreal Ever products, but this one left my hair dry, crunchy, and straw like.</li>
            <li> the line sulfate free of loreal is too much good,but i prefer result of loreal ever pure because this is a few difficult out of my hair,but result is very shine</li>
            <li> I used Enjoy, and Nexxus in the past - I always keep coming back to L&#x27;oreal.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this for people with my hair, which is soft and curly.</li>
            <li> I could barely run my fingers through my hair w/o it getting tangled.</li>
            <li> After reading a ton of natural hair blogs, they all seem to say the same thing:</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMEND to those with dry or colored hair.</li>
            <li> Years ago, there were few sulfate free shampoos on the market (just a few high end brands).  </li>
            <li> Older male using, that has shoulder legnth hair and 4&amp;#34; long beard.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick, creamy and produces a rich lather.</li>
            <li> It may be sulfate free but has a lot of other chemicals some of which when I looked them up state they can dry out your hair and cause frizz - that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m trying to fix, my dry and frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> My biggest complaint - my hair &amp; scalp do not feel clean.</li>
            <li> Likewise, a little bit of conditioner squishedthrough your clean hair and a wide tooth comb</li>
            <li> Leaves too much residue on hair, weighs it down and gave me dandruff.</li>
            <li> I have thick wavy long hair and have tried so many shampoos over the years even 5x as much as this one but never satisfied.</li>
            <li> but that is not necessary with every use i have super thick curly shoulder length hair that i color every 5 wks</li>
            <li> (pay be good or bad)</li>
            <li> I will admit I am a sucker for new products, especially hair products, so when I saw this new line by Loreal,</li>
            <li> a little of this goes a long way i used too much</li>
            <li> I did not have to use a ton of product like some other sulfate-free formulations I&#x27;ve tried - just a modest amount.</li>
            <li> It also made my hair really flat and greasy by the next day.&lt;br</li>
            <li> just recently dyed my hair, and despite claims of it being gentle dye and my hair being previously virgin, the dye made my hair very, very dry.  </li>
            <li> It is very moisturizing and may leave their hair feeling weighed down or \\&quot;coated\\&quot; but for my 4a tresses it works wonders!!</li>
            <li> Initially after washing my hair, I feel like a lot of my psoriasis is flaking off, and its super irritating.  </li>
            <li> My hair is extremely long, it&#x27;s down past my lower back, and a good rule of thumb (for any hair length past the shoulders) is to use shampoo from your shoulders up, and condition from the shoulders down.</li>
            <li> I find that a lot of shampoos strip my hair and leave it so dry, but this one does the opposite!</li>
            <li> (Definitely only for dry hair.)</li>
            <li> Now, when I get back indoors I have no problem running my fingers through my soft shiny hair to get out the few tangles the wind caused.  </li>
            <li> and just about every single Sunday there is a $1.00 or $2.00 coupon in the newspaper inserts so a tube is only $3.99 or $4.99</li>
            <li> I used to have a hard time brushing my hair after showering and the conditioner helped TONS with tangles - really smooths my hair.</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t like the way it smells, a strange fragrance.</li>
            <li> I have extremely long hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a shampoo and conditioner like this for a long time.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and</li>
            <li> Please save your money, don&#x27;t get anything fancy with a chemical list a mile long</li>
            <li> I am 57 years old and when my hair is wet and weighed down with water it is below my butt.  </li>
            <li> This is sulfate-free so it doesn&#x27;t harshly strip away natural oils from your hair leaving it dry and straw-like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> In desperation, trying to take care of this hair I have been growing forever, I went to the curly hair experts, Ouidad and spent about $150.00 on their shampoo, conditioner, and intensive conditioning treatment AND only let my hair air dry - which took like 9 hours</li>
            <li> What I do not like is that when I was my hair with it, it seems quite dry</li>
            <li> I have dry hair, which is damaged from dying and chemical treatment.</li>
            <li> It does not make my hair dry &amp; leaves them sleek &amp; shiny.</li>
            <li> I have semi course, dry hair.</li>
            <li> My hair was dry and not manageable.</li>
            <li> MADE MY HAIR DRY AND BRITTLE..</li>
            <li> AND WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANY BODY WITH DRY HAIR</li>
            <li> i truly recomend this product for people with dry hair and its Paraben-free; Sulfate-free; something i was looking for with an affordable price.  </li>
            <li> A few days later I used this stuff again with the same result.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was not clear that this xampoo was to a &amp;#34;dry to very dry hair&amp;#34;, therefore it did not work to my hair that is normal.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So, my hair type: I have a lot of hair, but it is pretty thin.  </li>
            <li> I have long, thick, wavy, color treated hair with highlights and my hair naturally leans towards the dry side.</li>
            <li> It is very thick and right on the borderline of being TOO heavy for my thick, waist length, wavy to straight combo hair.</li>
            <li> My bleached hair took on a yellow hugh, and it was extremely frustrating trying to moisturize my hair with tons of oils that normally would have made my hair greasy, but just added to the product build-up.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a very long way mixed with some water.</li>
            <li> I have very dry hair.</li>
            <li> like the way this smells, it&#x27;s a little bit like the Carol&#x27;s Daughter Monoi Repairing Shampoo but not quite the same.</li>
            <li> This product leaves my hair softer and healthier, and because its sulfate-free it takes care of my color too, even when I had red hair, and red is hard to take care of.</li>
            <li> I am completely addicted to the scent of this whole Evercreme line.  </li>
            <li> timely and items were as expected</li>
            <li> If there was a way to give this stuff a minus star rating I would.</li>
            <li> The price is not very costly (for the shampoo and conditioner)</li>
            <li> , I would use it a few times then switch to another brand then back again.</li>
            <li> so I bought that as it isn&#x27;t supplied at the washing sinks.  </li>
            <li> Spent one heck of a lot of money</li>
            <li> just what we expected</li>
            <li> Has a very strong artificial floral smell that&#x27;s extremely hard to rinse out.  </li>
            <li> With mile long, thick, curly wavy hair with ends that have been dyed a gazillion times (17 dye jobs a year x 22 years) there is no such thing as a shampoo and/or conditioner being too moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> Of course, I am now minus about 1/3 the hair!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I will go to any other product anymore.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, other products in this line are not so funky smelling.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this product to anyone who is fed up of having hair damaged due to heat or color.</li>
            <li> you try this one and don&#x27;t like it, give the other types in this line a try...</li>
            <li> /&gt;ALL of the L&#x27;Oreal sulfate-free lines I&#x27;ve checked, all contain silicones in some form or other (another reviewer mentioned this).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found it&#x27;s pretty difficult to find a silicone-free, petrolatum-free shampoo or conditioner in this price</li>
            <li> /&gt;Now my hair is sticky, stiff, and dry, and the ends are all tangled again.  </li>
            <li> My hair has been harder to detangle, drier, and a little crunchy feeling (this could be from the leave in?)</li>
            <li> I was worried about the small size of the bottle, but this stuff lathers so well that the little 8.5 oz bottle will last me MONTHS!</li>
            <li> Even fresh out of the shower it feels dirty.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect a lot, just guessed it would be about average.</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;m not sure if this shampoo is really irritating the psoriasis, and thus making it get thicker (yet to be determined), or if its really getting thinner.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, my hair is very damaged</li>
            <li> have thick, coarse, colored hair.</li>
            <li> Whatever Camelina is, I&#x27;m down with it.  </li>
            <li> L&#x27;oreal has not once let me down, yet.</li>
            <li> saw that some people said this weighed down their hair, and I can see that.</li>
            <li> The scalp lather that you work down to the ends of your hair</li>
            <li> Try some of their other products, just not this one!</li>
            <li> ALL OTHER SHAMPOOS CONTAIN HARSH DETERGENTS AND PARABINS WITCH</li>
            <li> then typical sulfate shampoo.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Having showered at night, by morning the fragrance is still slightly there, but nothing like others have reviewed it as.</li>
            <li> Way less frizzy and smoother and healthier feeling.</li>
            <li> I even tried using it less days before switching.</li>
            <li> Her hair is less damaged and is softer than ever.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not even half way</li>
            <li> I HAVE DONE AN EXTREME AMOUNT OF PRODUCT SWITCHING AND WASTED HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS ON WASTED PRODUCT THAT DRIED MY HAIR</li>
            <li> I HAVE BEEN WANTING TO TRY THIS NEW LINE OF L&#x27;OREAL PRODUCT, BUT THEY ARE ALL SO EXPENSIVE</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m still a little unsure of this product.  </li>
            <li> EverCreme shampoo (and the accompanying conditioner) leaves my hair heavy and &#x27;crunchy&#x27; no matter how thoroughly I rinse it out or how little I use.</li>
            <li> My hair feels dirty somehow, no matter how much I use.</li>
            <li> It was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair moisturized without being too heavy.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t have any trouble with the lather at all.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lastly, it has a heavy, perfumey odor that makes me sneezy.  </li>
            <li> Heavily perfumed shampoos are supposed to read \\&quot;classy\\&quot; -- I could not get this scent out of my hair no matter</li>
            <li> YET DESTROYING YOUR DEAD HAIR FOLLICLE</li>
            <li> I was still using it after I dyed it, and it was so harsh it made the color bleed.</li>
            <li> It also made my hair drier, weighed down my hair, and also dried my scalp out which has forced me to use dandruff shampoo.</li>
            <li> PLUS, being 57, I have A LOT of crazy wiry dry grey hairs popping up everywhere</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why.</li>
            <li> Yet there&#x27;s a weird oiliness to my hair that this shampoo left behind.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The hole is so small.</li>
            <li> It was stiff, dull, and straw-like.</li>
            <li> I was having serious problems with my hair seeming to be shorter and feeling like straw once I dried it.  </li>
            <li> I use heat on my hair and I do not own a heat protectant spray yet, and even if my hair feels drier than usual after curling or straightening, this shampoo always makes it softer than it was before.</li>
            <li> The smell is extremely hard to put into words but it is heavenly.</li>
            <li> Man, I am desperate to go home and wash my hair with my regular shampoo (organix keratin in the tan bottle) to get this L&#x27;Oreal crapola out of my hair and nose!</li>
            <li> (and anyone within 15 feet of you) at least 24 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you find sulfate-free shampoos annoying because they don&#x27;t seem very efficient, give this a try.</li>
            <li> price for amount (lasts 2-3 months for thick hair)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive it, but it is truly awful.</li>
            <li> It smells very ordinary.</li>
            <li> SERIOUSLY</li>
            <li> By mid day I wanted to go home and wash my hair again, it got that bad.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this shampoo very much.  It didn&#x27;t leave my hair soft and feeling moisturized at all.  My hair&#x27;s color treated and although this shampoo is sulfate free, it seemed rather harsh.  I also don&#x27;t like the way it smells, a strange fragrance. I much prefer Shea Moisture shampoo/conditioner and the Manuka Honey formula in particular.  They leave my hair soft, supple and shiny and feeling very nourished.  And there&#x27;s no frizz!  This Loreal shampoo is just OK, nothing special.  Years ago, there were few sulfate free shampoos on the market (just a few high end brands).  But now there are loads of options.  This Loreal shampoo is one of the first sulfate free shampoos I tried and for lack of a better alternative, I used it for quite some time.  However, now I know better.  It doesn&#x27;t do what I need it to do.  I won&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful, however it doesn&#x27;t do much as far as moisturizing my hair, goes. I&#x27;m still looking for that one shampoo that will make my color-treated hair feel normal. This isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li> I was having serious problems with my hair seeming to be shorter and feeling like straw once I dried it.  Thought maybe it was medications or something.  Then decided I should check out the shampoo I&#x27;d been using.  Sure enough, there were people shouting out their experiences trying to let others know the damage this shampoo does to your hair.  I have thin hair and ironically had moved on to their thickening formula, but it was still happening.  I&#x27;d been using this product for months never realizing my hair was breaking off.  Used my old tried and true yesterday and my hair was exactly the texture it used to be with no straw texture.  Of course, I am now minus about 1/3 the hair!  I&#x27;ll let it grow out over the winter and just consider it a lesson learned.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed it when I got it and read the ingredient list.  It may be sulfate free but has a lot of other chemicals some of which when I looked them up state they can dry out your hair and cause frizz - that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m trying to fix, my dry and frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this system for 2weeks and my hair has never been more dry. It feels &amp; looks like straw, except I&#x27;m sure straw has more body than my hair. My biggest complaint - my hair &amp; scalp do not feel clean. Even fresh out of the shower it feels dirty. Will not use this product another day!</li>
            <li> This shampoo irritated my scalp worse than any sulfate shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used. It also made my hair really flat and greasy by the next day.&lt;br /&gt;With that being said, I&#x27;ve also tried the intense nourshing shampoo and had better luck with that one. I&#x27;m not sure why. Perhaps because that one has silicones. Either way they are both loaded with far more chemicals then typical sulfate shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;My scalp is still itching and burning two days later. I would not purchase again and am returning.</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough good things about this product. My hair is long, fine, slightly wavy, and damaged. I ordered the shampoo and conditioner together and I feel like I have new hair. My hair is soft, shiny, and smells wonderful. I love to flat-iron my hair because I love the super straight look, and my hair almost looks like it&#x27;s been flat-ironed. I did not have to use a ton of product like some other sulfate-free formulations I&#x27;ve tried - just a modest amount. I was concerned I might have to shampoo my hair every day but I am on day 3 and my hair looks even better than on the first day. I have spent a LOT more on other products and this is the one I will be sticking with. I am a L&#x27;Oreal Paris EverCreme Sulfate-Free Moisture System Intense Nourishing.. girl now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: You know how the first time you use a product your hair seems to love it up, then the next few times the results are only so-so? That&#x27;s how it was with me and this shampoo and conditioner. I guess it&#x27;s fine for now - I will use these up until they are gone - but my search for the perfect sulfate free formula that allows my hair to look fabulous is not over.</li>
            <li> the line sulfate free of loreal is too much good,but i prefer result of loreal ever pure because this is a few difficult out of my hair,but result is very shine i recommend</li>
            <li> My 16 yo daughter loves this product for her wavy thick hair!</li>
            <li> I am completely addicted to the scent of this whole Evercreme line.  Whatever Camelina is, I&#x27;m down with it.  It&#x27;s like a warm brown sugar scent, but better...hard to describe in words.  The fragrance is EXTREMELY strong, so if you&#x27;re sensitive to fragrance, steer clear.  But, man, you gotta smell this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just recently dyed my hair, and despite claims of it being gentle dye and my hair being previously virgin, the dye made my hair very, very dry.  This stuff has brought back a lot of moisture, as it claims, and has no sulfates, parabens or waxes.  I love all of L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s sulfate-free lines, and they all smell really great.  But, this one is my all-time favorite, and will be a staple for me as long as it&#x27;s on the store shelves.</li>
            <li> I like this conditioner. I hate that they now put products in this type of container. What was wrong with the good old bottle! I hope Amazon keeps selling this product.</li>
            <li> Creamy and luxurious!</li>
            <li> Great conditioner. Smells really nice. Lee&#x27;s hair silky soft.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for a family member who loves it.  She said it makes her hair much softer and easier to work with.  It does not affect the coloring in her hair.  She has been using it for years.  She mentioned it can be difficult to find in local stores, so she was happy to see it available on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I use this all the time.  It was cheaper here and I did not have to go get it! It came to me!</li>
            <li> I LOVE the smell of this shampoo. It smells just like warm butter. It is very thick and right on the borderline of being TOO heavy for my thick, waist length, wavy to straight combo hair. However if I spend extra time rinsing and don&#x27;t use a lot of product it is just right. &amp; it seriously smells amazing.</li>
            <li> I use it only ones a week to moisturize my hair. I love it.</li>
            <li> Use it for both me and my 9 yr old daughter and we both love it!  It cleans nicely without stripping all of the good stuff out of your hair/ scalp, and has nice moisturizing propterties. Smells great too, like warm vanilla sugar.  I have used other products that are low or non sudsing or no poo, and this one is a good middle of the road one.  I also used another Evercreme called cleansing conditioner and it just didn&#x27;t work as well for me, it doesn&#x27;t suds up at all, so I had to use twice as much as this one, which I know it supposed to be better for your hair/scalp, but just didn&#x27;t clean as well for me.  Overall happy with this and do recommend it!</li>
            <li> The cap on this came with a piece chipped off (and not within the box) but still seals shut. As for the product, fantastic! I used this with the conditioner, and I could tell during the shower my hair was more moisturized than with other shampoos. After the shower, it was very soft and smelled fantastic! Much like how others describe it here. It was fragrant, so I could smell it but someone sitting next to me couldn&#x27;t unless I whipped my hair. Having showered at night, by morning the fragrance is still slightly there, but nothing like others have reviewed it as. I figure with continual use my hair will be even softer &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> timely and items were as expected</li>
            <li> This made my hair so soft! I love it! Highly recommend you buying it!</li>
            <li> Best shampoo I have ever used. I have extremely long hair and it takes just a quarter size amount to get a good washing. I use more than half the amount of other leading shampoo&#x27;s thus is saves me a ton of money and smells great. Its also on my auto ship shopping list from Amazon</li>
            <li> This product was not good for my hair. Before this, I was using the Aveeno Sulfate-free shampoo/conditioner. It was rather expensive so I decided to try the L&#x27;Oreal Ever crème Sulfate-free Moisture System. My hair started falling out! I ignored it at first because I was rather stressed at the time. Plus, I have really thin hair. But now, my hair has thinned out. Before using this product, maybe up to 10 hairs would be in my hairbrush in the mornings. Now, my hair falls out all through the day!! I would run my fingers through my hair and at least 20 hairs would be in my fingers! I would not ever recommend this product to anyone. It was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t buy shampoos over the counter, but I really like this one. When you put it in your hand, you can feel the richness. Leaves my hair moisturized without being too heavy. Will buy again!</li>
            <li> I have loved all of the L&#x27;Oreal Ever--- products that I have tried, and this was simply my next to try. I was so excited to receive it, but it is truly awful. My hair feels dirty somehow, no matter how much I use. I have thick, curly/wavy hair, I imagine it might be acceptable for someone with thin hair, but for me, this line was so bad that I couldn&#x27;t finish the bottle. Very disappointing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one good thing is the product smells decent.</li>
            <li> My hair feels good, smooth and shine</li>
            <li> I love this product. I&#x27;ve only found a select few shampoos/conditioners that seem to work well with my wavy/curly hair, but this one really stands out. I love the lather and my hair feels soft and bouncy. The price isn&#x27;t bad and The smell is addicting. Very happy.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for years and never needed an additional conditioner.</li>
            <li> You need just a little to clean your hair with the shampoo. Smooth and fragrant after use.</li>
            <li> Good. Good. Double good.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews on this product, followed the directions &amp; still ended up with cardboard hair. If there was a way to give this stuff a minus star rating I would. Honestly I can&#x27;t believe how damaging it turned out to be with simply one use! Used it last night &amp; got on to request a refund first thing this morning! Curly haired people BEWARE!!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite shampoo. I find that a lot of shampoos strip my hair and leave it so dry, but this one does the opposite! My hair is so soft and smooth, and I love that it&#x27;s sulfate free!</li>
            <li> This shampoo is one of a kind! This has to be the softest my hair has felt post wash and before conditioner was applied. This is sulfate-free so it doesn&#x27;t harshly strip away natural oils from your hair leaving it dry and straw-like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t have any trouble with the lather at all. If you cannot achieve suds your hair may be too oily - I pre-poo with coconut oil and the L&#x27;Oreal Paris EverStrong Overnight Treatment - before washing with shampoo I rinse with a basic conditioner (V05) to clarify and remove buildup/oil. It washed off as easy as it went in. I couldn&#x27;t believe my hair was soft and tangle free with shampoo alone. I have 4b/c textured hair so you can imagine my surprise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely update this as time goes on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this to those with dry hair looking for a great moisturizing shampoo.</li>
            <li> I like this shampoo, its very moisturizing.  I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because this isn&#x27;t my favorite out of their sulfate free line. I have extremely coarse hair and discovered their sleek line is better for me. I like the fact that they&#x27;re sulfate free. They won&#x27;t strip your color, but still have a nice full foaming effect.  They work really well and the price is very affordable compared to professional line shampoos.</li>
            <li> It was not clear that this xampoo was to a &amp;#34;dry to very dry hair&amp;#34;, therefore it did not work to my hair that is normal.&lt;br /&gt;this information should be MORE CLEAR in the first descriptions.</li>
            <li> My hair is curly and dry, this really moisturizes it and helps tame the fly aways...as well as softens them!</li>
            <li> This smells freaking amazing (like cake with fruit or something like that) and it&#x27;s the most concentrated shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used. A little goes a very long way mixed with some water. And it lathers like crazy. If you find sulfate-free shampoos annoying because they don&#x27;t seem very efficient, give this a try.</li>
            <li> Feels amazing!  The smell is fresh and the silkiness is fantastic!</li>
            <li> Bought both the shampoo and conditioner. I have very dry hair. I have tried all the expensive shampoos and L&#x27;Oreal Paris EverCreme Sulfate-Free Moisture System works as well or better. Great price on Amazon and a great purchase if you need to spend a few extra bucks for free shipping.</li>
            <li> bought this on a whim i normally use a high priced cleansing conditioner i love it but it is expensive so i thought i would try this out !! i am happy i did it left my hair super shiny it did not strip my color smells great&amp; lots of body a little of this goes a long way i used too much the first time.i did buy the nourishing conditioner to use with it but that is not necessary with every use i have super thick curly shoulder length hair that i color every 5 wks and this worked great i liked it so much today i bought the cleansing conditioner i hope it works as good!</li>
            <li> This is a great product- it lathers very well and has a decent smell. What I do not like is that when I was my hair with it, it seems quite dry and I feel as if I immediately need to put moisture back in. It is a decent product, though, I like that it is sulfate-free. Combined with the right conditioner (I use Aussie Moist), it does a great job.</li>
            <li> Love the way this stuff smells. I have fairly damaged hair from bleaching and it managed to smooth it rake away that &amp;#34;straw&amp;#34; feeling.</li>
            <li> Leaves too much residue on hair, weighs it down and gave me dandruff. Maybe it just didn&#x27;t work on my hair type. I have dry hair, which is damaged from dying and chemical treatment. I much preferred everpure smooth shampoo that made my hair silky without weighing it down, I just didn&#x27;t like the minty smell of that one, but I am going back to it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for over a year now and I love it. I would definitely recommend this for people with my hair, which is soft and curly.</li>
            <li> This shampoo smells soooooo good. If you read any of my other reviews, I love products that smell good. I like the way it leaves my 4A hair soft (without conditioner). Right 4A hair soft? really it works</li>
            <li> I love this product. It does not make my hair dry &amp; leaves them sleek &amp; shiny.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love. Shiny soft hair. Great for scalp.</li>
            <li> Ever-creme shampoo is a convenient usable product.  Fragrance, texture, packaging satisfactory. Good for travel or home. No spillage if dropped.&lt;br /&gt;Sulfate free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stu Perkins&lt;br /&gt;Retired Boffin</li>
            <li> seriously the best shampoo/conditioner I have found. I have super thick curly frizzy hair and this is the only kind that doesn&#x27;t make it go haywire. There are no salts in it and that is what dries your hair.</li>
            <li> the product arrive in bad shape, one of the containers was broken!!!!! i have the picture but don&#x27;t know how to attach it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I have semi course, dry hair. This shampoo along with the conditioner makes my hair silky smooth and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;L&#x27;Oreal were to ever discontinue making this stuff I&#x27;d cry.</li>
            <li> Good stuff. I&#x27;ve been looking for a shampoo and conditioner like this for a long time. Even the expensive stuff (like Morrocanoil) doesn&#x27;t do as good a job.</li>
            <li> This shampoo worked well for my african american relaxed hair! It cleansed nicely without bring over drying and didn&#x27;t tangle my hair nor make it hard.</li>
            <li> I use both Shampoo and Conditioner. They always leave my hair feeling silky smooth and smelling great! I can feel that it is nourishing my hair because my hair looks more healthy and manageable than before. I have dyed my hair before, I have done the Japanese Hair straightening treatment twice and I have done the Keratin hair treatment several times now. My keratin hair treatment has lasted for more than four months when it usually lasts 2 to 3 months. My hair is naturally curly, fine hair but after the Japanese treatment, it has not been the same. My hair now is wavy but still frizzy but with this shampoo and conditioner from L&#x27;Oreal, my hair does not frizz up as much as before and my Keratin  hair treatment lasts longer.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo.  Sulfate free so less damaging to your hair</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;smells DELICIOUS!&lt;br /&gt;makes hair really soft--better texture&lt;br /&gt;makes hair shinier&lt;br /&gt;decent price for amount (lasts 2-3 months for thick hair)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;NOT a good detangler&lt;br /&gt;hair feels limper--more tangly&lt;br /&gt;restores natural oils (pay be good or bad)</li>
            <li> L&#x27;oreal has not once let me down, yet. I&#x27;ve used several different products from them and I&#x27;ve always had positive effects. I tried this new one and it&#x27;s the best yet. I got the spray leave in conditioner type stuff and it just adds even more moisture to my hair. My hair type is normal, but I tend to color, and curl my hair, add a bit of add products for oomph so I need to put moisture back in. I don&#x27;t think I will go to any other product anymore. I used Enjoy, and Nexxus in the past - I always keep coming back to L&#x27;oreal. The price is not very costly (for the shampoo and conditioner) the extra products may cost around 10 to 14 dollars but I don&#x27;t care! My hair shines, soft texture,the smell is wonderful, and the lather from the shampoo moisturizes my skin! BONUS! Anyway- love the product! Thanks L&#x27;oreal! :)</li>
            <li> Yeccch!  This stuff is the worst.  I had a Brazilian keratin treatment that made my hair so soft and manageable.  Everything was great, just like the last time I had a keratin treatment, and I was loving my hair again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, I washed my hair with this yucky stuff.  (I bought it &#x27;cause it said \\&quot;sulfate free\\&quot; and you&#x27;re supposed to do that for keratin treatments)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now my hair is sticky, stiff, and dry, and the ends are all tangled again.  Yet there&#x27;s a weird oiliness to my hair that this shampoo left behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s kind of itchy, weighs hair down, and yet leaves it crispy and parched.  UGH!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, it has a heavy, perfumey odor that makes me sneezy.  Heavily perfumed shampoos are supposed to read \\&quot;classy\\&quot; -- I could not get this scent out of my hair no matter how well I rinsed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel allergic to this stuff.  I can&#x27;t get away from the smelly perfume.  Man, I am desperate to go home and wash my hair with my regular shampoo (organix keratin in the tan bottle) to get this L&#x27;Oreal crapola out of my hair and nose!</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this brand and this particular product. my hair is very processed and dry but when I use this shampoo/conditioner with the mask, its so smooth and soft. i have not been able to get this quality with shampoos 5 times as expensive. highly recommend</li>
            <li> Works well but can&#x27;t tell any difference from my Suave products.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo, I recently switched over from Dove moisturizing shampoo and conditioner. This shampoo (not to sound like a commercial) makes my hair so soft and healthy. I use it in combination with the EverSleek conditioner. I used to have a hard time brushing my hair after showering and the conditioner helped TONS with tangles - really smooths my hair. I also like using the Eversleek Precious Oil Treatment. With this trio my hair looks great. Way less frizzy and smoother and healthier feeling. Even with oil (i use it on my ends with the conditioner) my hair looks and feels cleaner, I used to wash my hair every day but now I can go every three days without grease build-up. I only wish they sold these in bigger bottles.</li>
            <li> Skip this shampoo if you are trying to find a silicone-free way of taking care of your hair.  The regular shampoo in this line is worth its weight in gold for what it has done for my hair.  After using this shampoo for over 1 month, I discovered that this contains AMODIMITHICONE, a water-soluable silicone.  I had been wondering why my hair was feeling \\&quot;crunchy\\&quot; and now I know why.  I love the Intense conditioner, though.  LOVE it!  Just stick with regular moisturizing shampoo!!</li>
            <li> I like the idea that they eliminated unwanted ingredients, but the results were poor. My hair was dry and not manageable.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo, with the conditioner as well, for about a year. I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thick, coarse, colored hair. So I need all the conditioning I can get, and this shampoo and conditioner provides it. Loreal also has the regular nourishing one (solid gold bottle), but I prefer this one because its stronger. This product leaves my hair softer and healthier, and because its sulfate-free it takes care of my color too, even when I had red hair, and red is hard to take care of. For a while, I was using the Matrix (orange bottle) and was paying a fortune, and I wasn&#x27;t happy. So I switched to this line, and will not go back, plus I&#x27;m saving lots of money!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw that some people said this weighed down their hair, and I can see that. This particular line from Loreal is the one packed with the most nourishing. So if you have fine, thinner hair, then it will most likely weigh your hair down, and even might make it on the greasy side. But if you have coarse or thick hair, I think this shampoo is perfect, and at a great price.</li>
            <li> Siempre vuelvo a comprar aqui. Recomendado 100%&lt;br /&gt;Estos productos son de los mejores e el mercado.&lt;br /&gt;Todo lo hecho en USA termina siendo mejor.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this series of shampoos and conditioners. They make my hair feel luxuriously soft and manageable. HIGHLY RECOMMEND to those with dry or colored hair.</li>
            <li> Bought for my daughter who can&#x27;t find the product near where she lives.  I use it and it leaves my hair soft,  had a light scent that&#x27;s nice, and doesn&#x27;t weigh my fine,  yet thick hair down.</li>
            <li> SERIOUSLY I&#x27;M IN LOVE WITH THIS PRODUCT AND ITS CONDITIONER....I HAVE DONE AN EXTREME AMOUNT OF PRODUCT SWITCHING AND WASTED HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS ON WASTED PRODUCT THAT DRIED MY HAIR OUT..AFTER A MONTH THEY ALL FELT NICE AT FIRST BUT THEN LOW AND BEHOLD MADE MY HAIR DRY AND BRITTLE..LOREALS EVERCREME INTENSE NOURISHING SHAMPOO AND CONDITIONER HAVE MADE SO MUCH DIFFERENCE AND IT HAS BEEN THE FIRST AND ONLY TIME I HAVE EVER NOTICED A DIFERENCE IN MY HAIR. THIS IS ALL I NEED NOW I HAVE FOUND THE ONE I&#x27;M ABSOLUTELY IN LOVE AND WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANY BODY WITH DRY HAIR WHO IS TIRED OF COMPANIES CLAIMING TO HAVE THE BEST PRODUCT BUT ARE LYING ALL OTHER SHAMPOOS CONTAIN HARSH DETERGENTS AND PARABINS WITCH ARE ALL KILLING YOUR HAIR OUT BETTER YET DESTROYING YOUR DEAD HAIR FOLLICLE AND ONCE DESTROYED THERE&#x27;S NO GOING BACK...BY THIS PRODUCT OF YOU CARE ABOUT YOUR HAIR AT ALL!!!!  !!!!!!!!!!  !!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This product has no sulfates and the conditioner to it has no silicones, but they work even better than ones I&#x27;ve paid more for. I have long hair and they last weeks since they are so rich. Also, I *love* how they smell. (:</li>
            <li> I use this shampoo with the matching conditioner.  I have super dry hair that is also color treated.  Its difficult to find sulfate free products at the drugstore and this one is definitely my favorite.  Sometimes sulfate free products produce little lather but this one definitely suds up. This keeps my color lasting longer, my hair super soft and it leaves no build up.  I personally love the vanilla smell.  I will keep repurchasing this.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is another on the long list of products I have tried in my quest for the perfect hair care system. I don&#x27;t hate it, but I don&#x27;t like it either. It&#x27;s okay to use from time to time and the smell is pleasant enough. The first time I used it I was impressed by how soft my hair felt. But by the fourth of fifth time my hair felt waxy and greasy. By mid day I wanted to go home and wash my hair again, it got that bad. And I did not use it every day, I would use it a few times then switch to another brand then back again. I even tried using it less days before switching. That did nothing to help. I do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I will admit I am a sucker for new products, especially hair products, so when I saw this new line by Loreal, I *had* to try it. I bought this from my local drug store and was a little hesitant because of the price (higher than listed here on Amazon), but I convinced myself it would be worth it. I have long, thick, wavy, color treated hair with highlights and my hair naturally leans towards the dry side. Anytime I see something that says moisturizing (add to it nourishing) then I am pulled away from my go to brand (Infusium 23). I was excited to try it and I just knew it was going to be a hair miracle, but sadly it was not at all! I bought the intense nourishing shampoo, conditioner, leave in spray and hair mask and I have been using all four items for over a week now. My hair has been harder to detangle, drier, and a little crunchy feeling (this could be from the leave in?) The only positives I can say is that my hair does seem to be a bit curlier and it smells wonderful. I&#x27;ve gotten a few compliments on how good it smells, but I can&#x27;t justify buying these products just because it makes my hair smell nice. I&#x27;ve tried many brands from drugstores and salons, and this isn&#x27;t the worst, but it isn&#x27;t the best either.</li>
            <li> I have no idea what Massey5 is talking about.  My hairdresser didn&#x27;t want to use Infusium 23 on my hair but she humored me and we both laughed at the disaster it made of my hair - - partway through drying my hair we were both so upset over how fried and frizzy my hair looked that she had to take me back to the sink and pour on conditioner to try to moisturize my hair and work out the fried tangles.  I am 57 years old and when my hair is wet and weighed down with water it is below my butt.  It is very thick and between a 2 and 3 in curliness.  It has been consistently dyed every 3 weeks for 22 years.  It takes my hairdresser about 45 minutes to blow it dry in an effort to try to tame the curl, because there are so many sections upon sections to all my hair.  PLUS, being 57, I have A LOT of crazy wiry dry grey hairs popping up everywhere that we \\&quot;chase\\&quot; with hair dye.  One by one, my hairdresser has tried every single brand of shampoo &amp; conditioner her salon sells and we never found 1 that really \\&quot;worked\\&quot; since, in my book, I have to be able to get good results when I take care of my hair between the 3 week touch-ups.  Some of her clients with shoulder length hair raved about the Moroccan Oil line so I bought that as it isn&#x27;t supplied at the washing sinks.  Spent one heck of a lot of money but it did nothing for my hair.  In desperation, trying to take care of this hair I have been growing forever, I went to the curly hair experts, Ouidad and spent about $150.00 on their shampoo, conditioner, and intensive conditioning treatment AND only let my hair air dry - which took like 9 hours (if I was lucky).  All I can say is thank God they have a 100% money back guarantee as my hair was horrible.  It tangled as soon as I detangled it and every morning I faced horribly snarled dry frizzy curls &amp; kinks.  The minute L&#x27;Oreal Ever Pure Moisturizing shampoo and conditioner for colored hair hit the stores I bought it and took it to my next hair appointment.  Alleluia !  For the first time since I was a child I liked how my hair looked every single time - - even when I washed it myself at home and blew it dry, I got the same great results.  When the Ever Creme Intensive line came out I was the first on line.  With mile long, thick, curly wavy hair with ends that have been dyed a gazillion times (17 dye jobs a year x 22 years) there is no such thing as a shampoo and/or conditioner being too moisturizing.  Can&#x27;t believe it but this super nourishing formula is a million times better than the Ever Pure which I loved.  Not a flyaway hair to be found.  No dried out ends which results in tangled or snarled curls.  Just soft SHINY SHINY SHINY wavy/curly hair that looks like I just walked out of the beauty shop.  Riverside, California gets very hot and we frequently have very high winds - - either of which can make long and/or curly wavy hair a nightmare.  Now, when I get back indoors I have no problem running my fingers through my soft shiny hair to get out the few tangles the wind caused.  For the first time, I can easily go the 4 - 5 days between shampoos which is all curly/wavy hair needs and my hair looks as good on day 5 as it did on day 1.  I no longer find myself giving up in the morning after only 2 or 3 days because my curls are so tangled I have to \\&quot;shampoo\\&quot; my hair with conditioner because even though the rest of my hair is clean the hair from my shoulders down is dry and fly away.  This is only 5.99 at Target, CVS, Rite Aid etc. and just about every single Sunday there is a $1.00 or $2.00 coupon in the newspaper inserts so a tube is only $3.99 or $4.99 and you don&#x27;t need gobs of this stuff.  Just a little bit lathers up to wash your scalp (which all an honest hairdresser will tell you is THE ONLY PART OF YOUR HAIR that needs to be washed.  The scalp lather that you work down to the ends of your hair is quite sufficient to clean any products off the fragile split-end prone length of your hair.  Likewise, a little bit of conditioner squishedthrough your clean hair and a wide tooth comb glides from scalp to ends like a hot knife through butter.  Try the Ever Creme Intensive Nourishing Shampoo and Conditioner line and I guarantee you will be addicted.</li>
            <li> I liked this one more than the other in this L&#x27;oreal series. it smells sweet and nice, and it leaves my hair soft. it doesn&#x27;t dry out your hair for sure. I keep changing my shampoo, so I love that the size is not too big and the price is low, probably because of the size.</li>
            <li> Love this line.  Makes your hair smell awesome and feel fantastic.</li>
            <li> I have tried other of the \\&quot;Loreal Ever-____\\&quot; line and they had worked great on my curly hair, which is slightly dry and of medium volume. The EverStrong worked GREAT, and the smell was AMAZING! However, one day I was completely out and my local Walmart no longer had that particular one stocked, so I decided to used the \\&quot;EverCreme Intense Nourishing\\&quot; shampoo and conditioner, thinking that it may actually be better for my curls!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product did not smell as good as the EverStrong. It smells very ordinary. It also made my hair drier, weighed down my hair, and also dried my scalp out which has forced me to use dandruff shampoo. This was on my non-dyed hair. I was still using it after I dyed it, and it was so harsh it made the color bleed. I experimented with my family members&#x27; shampoos, and they did not. I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Despite how much you rinse, this product leaves a residue in the hair. I think the manufacturer put too much conditioner in it. For people that care to wash their hair every day, it will work well. (Definitely only for dry hair.)</li>
            <li> Okay, so this stuff smells wonderful, if you like a heavy scent. That&#x27;s where it ends. It made my scalp horrible! My hair might have been a little more moisturized, but my scalp went haywire! I got dandruff from this stuff so bad, which I&#x27;ve never had! Now I can&#x27;t seem to get my scalp happy again. Never again!</li>
            <li> Has a very strong artificial floral smell that&#x27;s extremely hard to rinse out.  Fortunately, other products in this line are not so funky smelling.  But if you really do like it, be happy, because it&#x27;s gonna last you (and anyone within 15 feet of you) at least 24 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, what is it supposed to smell like anyway?  To me it smells like some cross between really cheap perfume and a strong hair dye solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What underlying odor are they trying to mask?  Lye?  Something worse?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pass.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo. I am stockpiling it in case it is ever discontinued. It doesn&#x27;t build up, smells great and leaves my hair soft and shiny. It&#x27;s also vegan, which I like. If shampoo this good can be made vegan for this price all shampoo should be.</li>
            <li> My naturally curly silver hair has always been unmanageable in humid climates until I started using this shampoo and conditioner.  After using L&#x27;Oreal, my hair feels so soft and looks healthy and shiny.  If the weather is especially humid, I apply a little L&#x27;Oreal EverSleek Precious Oil Treatment to my hair before I style it.  When I was in the Caribbean recently, my hair got curlier but didn&#x27;t go frizzy.  The EverCreme products have a lovely fragrance and I get comments from my husband of 29 years that my hair smells nice.  I love the L&#x27;Oreal EverCreme and EverSleek products!</li>
            <li> First of all, let me just say, this shampoo smells AMAZING. It&#x27;s so much better than any fruity shampoos I&#x27;ve been using. The smell is extremely hard to put into words but it is heavenly. This shampoo is gentle on color treated hair. My mom has dyed hair and she also uses this shampoo. Her hair is less damaged and is softer than ever. My hair is not dyed but this shampoo makes my hair soft as well, and (this isn&#x27;t advertised on the product but it is true) it removes dandruff BETTER than Head and Shoulders dandruff-specific shampoo. What? I know. It&#x27;s amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend using this with the conditioner that matches it because they work together like an ideal team on my hair. My hair is extremely long, it&#x27;s down past my lower back, and a good rule of thumb (for any hair length past the shoulders) is to use shampoo from your shoulders up, and condition from the shoulders down. I recommend this product to anyone who is fed up of having hair damaged due to heat or color. I use heat on my hair and I do not own a heat protectant spray yet, and even if my hair feels drier than usual after curling or straightening, this shampoo always makes it softer than it was before. It&#x27;s amazing, it&#x27;s like miracle shampoo. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this shampoo to anyone under 13 because it is geared towards adults and their hair. I&#x27;m sure it would be okay for a child to use this shampoo but it really is supposed to nourish hair and repair damaged or dry hair that is repeatedly heated or dyed. An excellent product well worth the five stars!</li>
            <li> Smells great, cleans well and works as it says it will.  Will definitely order again and recommend it to others looking for a good shampoo without sulphates.</li>
            <li> I agree with the handful of other reviewers who said they liked the other L&#x27;Oreal Ever products, but this one left my hair dry, crunchy, and straw like. I could barely run my fingers through my hair w/o it getting tangled. I also only used this as a every-other-day shampoo because my hair did not feel 100% clean after using it. I would follow up the next day w/ a sulfate shampoo to get rid of the residue. After noticing the change in my hair, I switched back to my old tried-and-true Pantene shampoo and my hair seemed to return to normal. Try some of their other products, just not this one!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit pricey but I love the rich lather and it&#x27;s sulfate free and has no harsh ingredients.</li>
            <li> This shampoo kind of has a wood smoke odor to it. I&#x27;ve used it for about a  month and it really lathers up. Older male using, that has shoulder legnth hair and 4&amp;#34; long beard. Works well with the accompaning Conditioner by the same name.  The squeeze tube  design is horrible. The cap body does not unscrew off the bottle. I found it difficult to squeeze out the shampoo at times. The hole is so small. On the third use the pinch seam on the opposite end split open while trying to squeeze shampoo out....</li>
            <li> Great for curly/wavy hair!</li>
            <li> I had a sample of this from some subscription or gift with purchase (I forget which) so I figured I would try it. I didn&#x27;t expect a lot, just guessed it would be about average. I was wrong. This is one of the best shampoos I&#x27;ve used for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have color-treated hair, so I was happy that this was sulfate-free. Despite being sulfate-free, it lathers really well. It also rinses out cleanly and without leaving residue, and I feel like it does a good job of getting my hair clean. (You can see the full ingredients list by zooming in on the second product image.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the way this smells, it&#x27;s a little bit like the Carol&#x27;s Daughter Monoi Repairing Shampoo but not quite the same. I used this along with the conditioner from the same product line and my hair felt amazing the next day. It was really one of the more dramatic overnight differences I&#x27;ve noticed. (I hate to gush about products, but it&#x27;s been cold and dry here lately, and usually that&#x27;s bad news for my hair.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For what it&#x27;s worth, I did use a detangling spray after getting out of the shower, but while my hair was still wet.</li>
            <li> I HAVE BEEN WANTING TO TRY THIS NEW LINE OF L&#x27;OREAL PRODUCT, BUT THEY ARE ALL SO EXPENSIVE IN STORE, I WAS SO HAPPY WHEN I FOUND THE WHOLE LINE HERE, IT ARRIVED VERY FAST &amp; WAS IN PERFECT CONDITION, I HAVE ALREADY ORDERED MORE, WILL ORDER AGAIN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH</li>
            <li> Ok, I initially bought this shampoo because I&#x27;m trying anything to get my psoriasis under control.  So, currently, I&#x27;m trying the sulfate free stuff.  So, I&#x27;ve been using this for about two weeks now, I&#x27;m still a little unsure of this product.  So, my hair type: I have a lot of hair, but it is pretty thin.  This product makes my hair a lot thicker, indeed.  It doesn&#x27;t feel crunchy or bad, just feels thicker.  I sort of feel like its not all rinsing out of my hair, like its greasy.  It makes my hair tangle a lot though.  I constantly feel like I need to brush it, and everytime I do, I lose a lot of hair.  Initially after washing my hair, I feel like a lot of my psoriasis is flaking off, and its super irritating.  But after my hair dries, it seems as though its pretty much under control (which hasn&#x27;t happened with other shampoos).  So, I&#x27;m not sure if this shampoo is really irritating the psoriasis, and thus making it get thicker (yet to be determined), or if its really getting thinner.  I guess I&#x27;m not really happy with how it is for my hair, but if it helps the scalp, then I&#x27;m in.&lt;br /&gt;So, bottom line, is undecided</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the other shampoo in this line (L&#x27;Oreal Hydrate EverStrong) with good results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Decided to try EverCreme...did not get the same results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The EverCreme shampoo (and the accompanying conditioner) leaves my hair heavy and &#x27;crunchy&#x27; no matter how thoroughly I rinse it out or how little I use. My daughter had better luck, maybe it&#x27;s just not good for my hair type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you try this one and don&#x27;t like it, give the other types in this line a try...another might work for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ALL of the L&#x27;Oreal sulfate-free lines I&#x27;ve checked, all contain silicones in some form or other (another reviewer mentioned this). I&#x27;ve found it&#x27;s pretty difficult to find a silicone-free, petrolatum-free shampoo or conditioner in this price range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Btw, the expensive silicone-free shampoos/conditioners that are $20 or more per bottle - check the ingredients, often it&#x27;s just vegetable glycerin, essential oils, and propylene glycol (a preservative). You can buy the veg glycerin and oils on your own much more cheaply (all sold here on Amazon). Skip the preservatives and keep your mix in the fridge or buy your own propylene glycol (also sold here on Amazon).</li>
            <li> My wife loves this product and the price we paid for it. It saved us time since we didn&#x27;t have to go out for it.</li>
            <li> Love this smell to this shampoo and it really does make your hair feel soft and smoother.</li>
            <li> This shampoo felt great in the shower. It bubbled up okay (not as many bubbles as sulfate shampoo, but there was a decent lather), and my hair didn&#x27;t feel \\&quot;squeaky\\&quot; and overstripped after I rinsed. It did feel clean though. After I used the matching conditioner my hair felt baby soft... while it was wet. When I got out of the shower and let it air dry, it felt awful. It was stiff, dull, and straw-like. A few days later I used this stuff again with the same result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I eventually used a different shampoo with the EverCreme conditioner and my hair felt normal afterward, so I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that my hair just doesn&#x27;t like this particular shampoo. Also, the smell was a bit too perfumey for my taste (it lingers for awhile too), but I could tolerate it. So if you&#x27;re the type who dislikes hair products with strong smells, I don&#x27;t recommend trying anything from the EverCreme line because they all have the same perfume type scent.</li>
            <li> My hair felt like straw after using this. I used it a second time and my scalp started itching. This didn&#x27;t work for me at all.</li>
            <li> this shampoo its very good for dry hair like mine. my hair dreser washed my hair and i felt my hair soft, not dry, and also have great smell, like vanilla. i truly recomend this product for people with dry hair and its Paraben-free; Sulfate-free; something i was looking for with an affordable price.  well i just used it once but i hope keep giving me good results....</li>
            <li> This is the first sulfate-free shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used. After reading a ton of natural hair blogs, they all seem to say the same thing: sulfate is NOT good for your hair. It dries it out and makes it brittle (which is why you always have to follow up with a moisturizing conditioner).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I chose L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Evercreme mainly because it was the first brand with a sulfate-free offering that I could find in my local stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the smell and texture of this shampoo. It&#x27;s thick, creamy and produces a rich lather. It cleans my scalp pretty well. I guess it pretty much does what shampoo is supposed to do, just without the sulfates. I also love that the Sunday paper sometimes has coupons for L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Evercreme line. You can get it for a steal when combining the sale price + a coupon.</li>
            <li> Hair History:&lt;br /&gt;I USED to have gorgeous dark healthy hair :( I didn&#x27;t appreciate it, and bleached it.. dyed it.. multiple times.  Needless to say, my hair is very damaged and I cut away a lot of fried pieces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product History:&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t have to use conditioner in the shower when my hair was virgin (and even after bleaching- I must have tough hair) I used Organix shampoo (which I consider ALL of their lines to be clarifying shampoos), then I would put Garnier leave in conditioner and use oil on my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Product:&lt;br /&gt;In the shower, it&#x27;s definitely not a clarifying shampoo and I knew it wasn&#x27;t intended to be so I gave it a chance for a week. In the shower, my hair was silky and felt like I was washing with conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RESULTS:&lt;br /&gt;Hardened, product laden hair.  My bleached hair took on a yellow hugh, and it was extremely frustrating trying to moisturize my hair with tons of oils that normally would have made my hair greasy, but just added to the product build-up.  A vicious cycle.  Please save your money, don&#x27;t get anything fancy with a chemical list a mile long</li>
            <li> I did not find this EverCreme product to be anything other than OK.  I did not care for the fragrance of this shampoo which I used  prior to using the conditioner.  It does a good job of lathering and that&#x27;s a plus, but it&#x27;s not what I had expected.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  Every tme I try something different I end up coming back to this.  Definitely makes my hair softer.</li>
            <li> this is pretty much the best shampoo I have used in my entire live!</li>
            <li> When used with the conditioner your hair comes out full and soft, cleaner than your old shampoo!</li>
            <li> i love this. makes my hair feel so silky and look so shiny. also reduces the frizz.</li>
            <li> just what we expected</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal Please don&#x27;t ever change this formula! I have thick wavy long hair and have tried so many shampoos over the years even 5x as much as this one but never satisfied. This leaves my dry processed hair silky smooth, soft and manageable. I&#x27;m hooked, highly recommend this. I bought mine at my local drug store but will be putting it on my subscribe and save list.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews on this product and decided to try it.  Having hair that frizzes easily was my motivation to try it and I was happily surprised that it controls the frizzes and left my hair more manageable</li>
            <li> Love this product and Amazon&#x27;s price. It&#x27;s a good sulfate free product my hair is soft and easy to flat iron after using this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all types of shampoos and conditioners from expensive ones from a salon to the cheapest ones on the market. I&#x27;ve tried the organic ones too which are great. But this shampoo and conditioner tops it. The smell is heavenly, and the cream is so reach and softens my hair perfectly. I love it!</li>
            <li> Loreal evercreme, everpure and all its product line is extremely good.  Specially for frizzy and dry hair.  Also they smell really delicious</li>
            <li> Like a high-end shampoo at an affordable price. Leaves my color-treated hair soft. Delicious.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed for my allergies.</li>
            <li> Looked for a shampoo and conditioner that didn&#x27;t irritate my scalp, and the lack of sulfates has done the trick.  Hair and scalp both feeling just right.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this product after trying a sample of the EverSleek sulfate free shampoo. My hair was so soft after washing with it, I was SURE the EverCreme would just be great as it was supposed to be for moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  And I was RIGHT! As soon as that shampoo hit my hair it felt softer. I could actually MASSAGE my scalp without feeling like I was tearing through my hair! The last time I used a shampoo that made my hair feel like this was when they were still making Creme of Nature in the Purple bottle- but this one smells like coconut or vanilla or something WONDERFUL instead of that awful chemical scent the CoN had. I was worried about the small size of the bottle, but this stuff lathers so well that the little 8.5 oz bottle will last me MONTHS! (So far I&#x27;m on month 2 and I&#x27;m not even half way the bottle yet!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I can see why someone with finer hair wouldn&#x27;t care for this product. It is very moisturizing and may leave their hair feeling weighed down or \\&quot;coated\\&quot; but for my 4a tresses it works wonders!! As far as I can see I&#x27;m done looking for my holy grail shampoo. This is it. The price is right, it smells wonderful, my hair feels clean after using it, but not stripped at ALL, It&#x27;s available on the ground. The only thing is I wish I could find it in a large bottle. Not that this bottle won&#x27;t last FOREVER, I just tend to like to buy things in GIANT sizes!! LoL!</li>
            <li> my wife loves that it keeps hair better and doresn&#x27;t pull the color from her hair.</li>
